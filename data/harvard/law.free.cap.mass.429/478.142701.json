(Southwestern Bell). The permit allows Southwestern Bell to construct a one hundred foot wireless telecommunications tower in a residential area of Littleton (town) on land abutting the owners\u2019 respective properties. On February 1, 1996, Congress enacted the Telecommunications Act of 1996 (TCA), Pub. L. No. 104-104, 110 Stat. 56 (codified at 47 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 151 et seq., as amended). The Act made substantial changes to Federal regulation of telecommunications in recognition of, and to facilitate the spread of, new technologies nationwide. H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 104-458, 104th Cong., 2d Sess. 113 (1996), reprinted in 1996 U.S.C.C.A.N. 124. Prior to the TCA, telecommunications regulation envisioned natural monopolies predicated on one-wire, one-carrier systems. See, e.g., 47 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 151-613. The TCA abolished artificial distinctions among signal delivery methods and opened markets to multiple providers employing various service delivery technologies.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> See, e.g., H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 104-458 at 148, 159 (1996), reprinted in 1996 U.S.C.C.A.N. 148, 172.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-11\">The new emphasis on competition is reflected in the many provisions of the TCA that seek to accelerate private sector deployment of new telecommunications technologies. Personal wireless services (PWS) technology is among those the TCA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>specifically addresses. See, e.g., 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 332(c)(7).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> PWS technology sends low-power, high-frequency radio signals among relay towers (PWS towers) and switching stations. For signals to be available throughout an area, or cell, a network of PWS towers and associated support structures must be placed in a lattice or honeycomb grid. If a tower is not present at a site mandated by the lattice arrangement, a coverage gap arises. Coverage gaps prevent customers from receiving and sending signals, and when customers pass through a coverage gap their calls are disconnected. Such gaps not only inconvenience current customers, but may also impede the spread of the technology by making it less useful and less attractive to potential customers. See <em>Primeco Personal Communications, L.P. </em>v. <em>Fox Lake, </em>26 F. Supp. 2d 1052, 1054 (N.D. Ill. 1998); Note, Wading Through the Rhetoric of the Telecommunications Act of 1996: Uncertainty of Local Zoning Authority Over Wireless Telecommunications Tower Siting, 22 Vt. L. Rev. 461, 467-477 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">The PWS towers must be of' sufficient height and placed at sufficient elevation to allow for the passage of the signals. The resulting visibility of PWS towers frequently spawns local resistance to their placement within communities. To facilitate the spread of this technology, and to promote transparency and accountability in local zoning decisions regarding permits for PWS providers, the TCA imposes procedural and substantive obligations on local zoning authorities. See 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 332(c)(7), entitled \u201cPreservation of local zoning authority,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>the full text of which is set forth in the margin.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Substantively, local regulation may not \u201cunreasonably discriminate\u201d among PWS providers, nor may it \u201cprohibit or have the effect of prohibiting\u201d the provision of PWS services. 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 332(c)(7)(B)(i). There may be no regulation of facilities \u201con <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>the basis of the environmental effects of radio frequency emissions,\u201d other than as required by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 332(c)(7)(B)(iv). Procedurally, a local zoning authority must act \u201cwithin a reasonable period of time\u201d on any request regarding a PWS facility, \u201ctaking into account the nature and scope of such request.\u201d 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 332(c)(7)(B)(ii). Any local authority decision \u201cto deny a request\u201d t\u00f3 site such a facility must be \u201cin writing and supported by substantial evidence contained in a written record.\u201d 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 332(c)(7)(B)(iii). Congress further provided that expedited redress be available in either Federal or State court to \u201c[a]ny person adversely affected\u201d by an act of a local zoning authority \u201cthat is inconsistent with this subparagraph.\u201d 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 332(c)(7)(B)(v).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">Subject to these enumerated constraints, the TCA recognizes and protects local autonomy regarding PWS facility placement. Congress was explicit that the TC\u00c1 does not preempt State and local authority with respect to any zoning and land use issues pertaining to PWS facilities, other than as delineated in \u00a7 332(c)(7) of the TCA. See 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 332(c)(7)(A). At issue in this case is whether the TCA requirement of local zoning authorities that any decision \u201cto deny\u201d a request to construct a cellular facility \u201cbe in writing and supported by substantial evidence contained in a written record,\u201d 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 332(c)(7)(B)(iii), preempts, under the supremacy clause of the United States Constitution, de novo judicial review of all local zoning authority decisions pursuant to G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 17. We hold that it does not. We vacate, in part, the judgment of the Superior Court and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b502-7\">In 1997, Southwestern Bell applied to the planning board of Littleton (planning board) for a special permit and site plan approval to build a PWS facility.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Southwestern Bell proposed to build the facility on a residentially zoned parcel containing a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>water standpipe (locus)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> on Newtown Hill in the town. The plaintiffs, David W. Roberts (Roberts) and Jean H. Lawlis (together, abutters), own parcels of land immediately adjacent either to the locus, or to an easement burdened by use of the locus.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The abutters were among those who opposed Southwestern Bell\u2019s application in public planning board hearings. On June 19, 1997, the planning board granted Southwestern Bell a special permit and site plan approval. Pursuant to G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 17,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> the abutters sought judicial review of that decision, naming Southwestern Bell and the planning board as defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>Southwestern Bell moved for summary judgment on the existing administrative record.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> It claimed that the TCA preempted G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 17, and that any review of the planning board\u2019s decision should be limited to the existing record using the \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d standard contained in 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 332(c)(7)(B)(iii). A judge in the Superior Court agreed. He concluded that the written record of the planning board contained \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d to support the approval of the special permit, granted Southwestern Bell\u2019s motion for summary judgment, and ordered that summary judgment enter in favor of the planning board \u201cto the same extent as to Southwestern Bell.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> He awarded costs to Southwestern Bell and the planning board.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">Southwestern Bell had also moved to dismiss five counts of the abutters\u2019 second amended complaint for failure to state claims upon which relief could be granted, and for failure to name necessary parties.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Those counts alleged that (1) Southwestern Bell\u2019s failure to file its application with the town clerk as required by G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 9, deprived the planning board of jurisdiction to consider the application; (2) the planning board did not have jurisdiction to change the use of the locus owned by the water department or (3) to change the use of the locus because the easement runs over conservation land; (4) the special permit constituted spot zoning; and (5) the planning board\u2019s decision-making process was tainted by bias and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>violated the abutters\u2019 due process rights. The judge granted Southwestern Bell\u2019s motion. He again ordered that partial summary judgment and dismissal of specific counts in favor of the planning board be allowed \u201cto the same extent as to Southwestern Bell.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">Southwestern Bell also moved to dismiss the second amended complaint pursuant to Mass. R. Civ. P. 12 (b) (1), 365 Mass. 754 (1974), claiming that the abutters were not \u201cperson[s] aggrieved\u201d under G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 17. While the judge\u2019s order does not specifically reference this motion, in his memorandum of decision he concluded that the abutters did have standing to challenge the decision of the planning board, citing <em>Marashlian </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Newburyport, </em>421 Mass. 719 (1996). Southwestern Bell does not appeal from this determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">The abutters took an appeal from the final judgment in the Superior Court dismissing their action and awarding costs, including all orders \u201cunderlying\u201d the judgment. We granted their application for direct appellate review.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b505-7\">n</p>\n<p id=\"b505-8\">Southwestern Bell argues that the TCA preempts de novo judicial review of the planning board\u2019s decision to grant its special permit on two grounds: (1) it would frustrate the Federal scheme embodied in the TCA \u201cto accelerate rapidly private sector deployment of advanced telecommunications technologies,\u201d H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 104-458 at 113 (1996), reprinted in 1996 U.S.C.C.A.N. 124; and (2) de novo determination of the facts, as required by G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 17, conflicts with the requirement of 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 332(c)(7)(B)(iii) that a decision of a planning board to deny a request \u201cbe in writing and supported by substantial evidence contained in a written record.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b505-9\">Massachusetts is one of several States that provide for de novo review of local zoning authority decisions. G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 17.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> See <em>Bicknell Realty Co. </em>v. <em>Board of Appeal of Boston, </em>330 Mass. 676, 679 (1953). On appeal to the Superior Court or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>Land Court, a judge determines the legal validity of a zoning board decision on the facts found by him; he gives no evidentiary weight to the board\u2019s findings. <em>Josephs </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Brookline, </em>362 Mass. 290, 295 (1972), and cases cited. Judicial review is nevertheless circumscribed: the decision of the board \u201ccannot be disturbed unless it is based on a legally untenable ground, or is unreasonable, whimsical, capricious or arbitrary.\u201d <em>MacGibbon </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Duxbury, </em>356 Mass. 635, 639 (1970), citing <em>Gulf Oil Corp. </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Framingham, </em>355 Mass. 275, 277 (1969). On the other hand, the substantial evidence standard of review of an administrative record \u201cgoes to the reasonableness of what the agency did on the basis of the evidence before it.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Carlo Bianchi &amp; Co., </em>373 U.S. 709, 715 (1963). We consider whether the TCA preempts G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 17, and whether all decisions of a local zoning authority concerning \u201ca request to place, construct, or modify personal wireless service facilities,\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 332(c)(7)(B)(iii), must be reviewed on the record of the proceedings before the local authority, whether the board denied or granted the request.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">\u201cState law, including municipal regulations, can be preempted by an act of Congress if the State law \u2018conflicts with federal law or would frustrate the federal scheme, or [if] the courts discern from the totality of the circumstances that Congress sought to occupy the field to the exclusion of the States.\u2019 \u201d <em>Arthur D. Little, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Health &amp; Hosps. of Cambridge, </em>395 Mass. 535, 548 (1985), quoting <em>Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Massachusetts, </em>471 U.S. 724, 747-748 (1985). In determining whether State law has been preempted, \u201cwe start with the assumption that the historic police powers of the States were not to be superseded by the Federal Act unless that was the clear and manifest purpose of Congress.\u201d <em>Arthur D. Little, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Health &amp; Hosps. of Cambridge, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number><em>supra </em>at 549, quoting <em>Pacific Gas &amp; Elec. Co. </em>v. <em>State Energy Resources Conservation &amp; Dev. Comm\u2019n, </em>461 U.S. 190, 206 (1983). See <em>Louisiana Pub. Serv. Comm\u2019n </em>v. <em>FCC, </em>476 U.S. 355, 369 (1986) (\u201ccritical question in any pre-emption analysis is always whether Congress intended that [F]ederal regulation supersede [S]tate law\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">Congress, of course, expressly did not seek to occupy the field, and nothing in the TCA or its legislative history suggests that Congress intended to supersede Massachusetts\u2019s statutory provision for de novo review of local authority zoning decisions. To the contrary, the first paragraph of the applicable section of the TCA provides that \u201c[e]xcept as provided in this paragraph, nothing in this chapter shall limit or affect the authority of a State or local government\u201d over siting decisions of PWS facilities, 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 332(c)(7)(A), and \u201cthis paragraph\u201d has no such provision.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The legislative history is equally clear: \u201cThe conference agreement creates a new section 704 which prevents [FCC] preemption of local and State land use decisions and preserves the authority of State and local governments over zoning and land use matters except in the limited circumstances set forth in the conference agreement.\u201d H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 104-458 at 207-208 (1996), reprinted in 1996 U.S.C.C.A.N. 222. Particularly where the subject of the Federal provisions at issue, here zoning and local land use regulation, is one traditionally within the purview of State and local government, Federal law will not preempt unless that is the clear and manifest intent of Congress.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> See <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Rath Packing Co., </em>430 U.S. 519, 525 (1977). See also <em>Arthur D. Little, Inc. </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number><em>Commissioner of Health &amp; Hosps. of Cambridge, supra </em>at 546, quoting <em>San Diego Bldg. Trades Council </em>v. <em>Garmon, </em>359 U.S. 236, 243-244 (1959) (\u201cthis court, and the United States Supreme Court, have been particularly reluctant to overturn State laws which are \u2018deeply rooted in local feeling and responsibility\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">Recognizing that the language of the TCA does not afford it the relief it seeks, Southwestern Bell argues that Federal preemption arises because de novo judicial review \u201cwould frustrate the federal scheme,\u201d <em>Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Massachusetts, supra </em>at 747, favoring rapid zoning determinations for PWS facility siting requests. While it is clear that Congress intended to encourage the rapid deployment of new telecommunications technologies, Congress simultaneously made clear that it had no intention of interfering with States\u2019 zoning power, except in the limited circumstances provided in the statute. De novo judicial review is not circumscribed by the circumstances enumerated. The statute requires that siting decisions be made by local authorities \u201cwithin a reasonable period of time.\u201d 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 332(c)(7)(B)(ii).<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Subparagraph (v), in turn, provides that an appeal by any person \u201cadversely affected\u201d by a decision of a planning board \u201cthat is inconsistent with this subparagraph\u201d shall be heard and decided by a court \u201con an expedited basis.\u201d 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 332(c)(7)(B)(v). \u201cExpedited\u201d review is mandated only where the \u201cfinal action\u201d of the planning board \u201cis inconsistent with this subparagraph,\u201d and Southwestern Bell makes no claim that the planning board\u2019s decision is inconsistent with 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 332(c)(7)(B). In any event, Southwestern Bell makes no reasonable argument why <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>the review provided under G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 17, does not satisfy the expedited review provision of subparagraph (v), assuming that it applies. General Laws c. 40A, \u00a7 17, seventh par., provides that all zoning appeals \u201cshall have precedence over all other civil actions and proceedings.\u201d See Superior Court Standing Order 1-88, providing that zoning appeals pursuant to G. L. c. 40A be on the \u201cFast Track.\u201d Massachusetts already mandates the expediting of zoning appeals.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> See <em>United States Cellular Corp. </em>v. <em>Board of Adjustment of Des Moines, </em>589 N.W.2d 712, 716 (Iowa 1999) (noting favorably trial court\u2019s de novo review of zoning authority denial of communications tower special permit).</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">While several courts have noted the TCA\u2019s emphasis on increasing the ability of telecommunications providers to obtain permits in an expedited manner, see, e.g., <em>Sprint Spectrum L.P. </em>v. <em>Easton, </em>982 F. Supp. 47, 49-50 (D. Mass. 1997); <em>Paging, Inc. </em>v. <em>Board of Zoning Appeals for the County of Montgomery, </em>957 F. Supp. 805, 807 (W.D. Va. 1997), Congress did not intend that speed be the only consideration of a reviewing court. Congress certainly intended to protect providers of PWS services from irrational or substanceless decisions by local authorities who might bend to community opposition to these facilities. It did not express any intent to impair the rights of abutting property owners specifically protected by State law.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Congress carefully crafted the language of the statute authorizing expedited judicial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>review.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> \u201c[T]he statute provides a clear, detailed process that allows quick and complete remedies for individuals <em>improperly denied permission </em>to erect a personal wireless communication tower. Given this carefully drafted provision, and the absence of any indicia of contrary congressional intent, it is manifest that Congress provided precisely the remedies it considered appropriate when drafting the TCA.\u201d <em>National Telecommunication Advisors, Inc. </em>v. <em>Chicopee, </em>16 F. Supp. 2d 117, 122 (D. Mass. 1998) (emphasis added).<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">Federal preemption of State law may also arise if the State law is in \u201cactual conflict\u201d with Federal law. <em>Louisiana Pub. Serv. Comm\u2019n </em>v. <em>FCC, </em>476 U.S. 355, 368 (1986). Southwestern Bell argues that judicial de novo fact finding as required by G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 17, is in \u201cactual conflict\u201d with 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 332(c)(7)(B)(iii) which, it claims, operates as a burden shifting provision, placing on the \u201copponent\u201d of a siting request the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>obligation to place in the administrative record substantial evidence to support denial of the request. We do not interpret \u00a7 332(c)(7)(B)(iii) to shift the burden between a PWS provider seeking site approval and a neighboring property owner with standing to appeal from a decision of a local zoning authority. Rather, it sets forth standards that a local authority must meet if it denies a siting request: the denial must be in writing, and supported by substantial evidence contained in a written record.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Congress enacted these standards to prevent local authorities from \u201cmasking] hostility to wireless communications facilities with unreasoned denials that make only vague references to applicable legal standards.\u201d <em>AT &amp; T Wireless Servs. of Fla., Inc. </em>v. <em>Orange County, </em>982 F. Supp. 856, 860 (M.D. Fla. 1997). Subparagraph (B)(iii) says nothing about-the burden of any \u201copponent\u201d of a siting request. To support a claim of preemption, the defendants are \u201crequired to prove their case with hard evidence of conflict, and not merely with unsupported pronouncements as to [Federal] \u2018policy.\u2019 \u201d <em>Grocery Mfrs. of Am., Inc. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Health, </em>379 Mass. 70, 81-82 (1979), quoting <em>Kargman </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>552 F.2d 2, 6 (1st Cir. 1977). They have not done so. Congress intended to leave to the States their traditional zoning authority, provided that PWS facilities were not banned outright, that providers were treated equally, and that any local authority decision to deny a permit was not arbitrary. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 332(c)(7)(B). Where, as here, there is no \u201cactual, impermissible conflict between the local and federal law,\u201d <em>Kargman </em>v. <em>Sullivan, supra, </em>preemption does not arise.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">m</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">On appeal the abutters raise multiple additional claims, independent of their challenge to the motion judge\u2019s ruling on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>preemption. These claims concern motions to dismiss filed by the defendants in the Superior Court regarding various counts in the second amended complaint and granted by the motion judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">(a) In count one of their second amended complaint, the abutters alleged that Southwestern Bell had failed to file its application for a special permit and site plan approval with the Littleton town clerk, as required by G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 9,<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> thereby depriving the planning board of jurisdiction to consider the application. A provision of the Littleton zoning code requires an applicant to file its application for a special permit with the planning board; the applicant then sends a copy to the town clerk. See Littleton Code, Zoning \u00a7 173-7(B). Southwestern Bell filed its application with the planning board on or about March 17, 1997. A copy of the special permit application, dated April 7, 1997, was thereafter available in the town clerk\u2019s office. The application was considered at public hearings on April 9, April 30, May 29, and June 12, 1997, and approved on June 19, 1997. In this case Southwestern Bell\u2019s application was available for inspection from the town clerk by members of the public before the public hearings.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> The abutters do not claim that they were prejudiced because Southwestern Bell\u2019s application was not filed directly with the town clerk. We agree with the motion judge\u2019s ruling that \u201cnot every failure to precisely follow the procedural requirements of Chapter 40A is a jurisdictional defect.\u201d See <em>Schulte </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., </em>369 Mass. 74, 79-80 (1975); <em>Richardson </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Framingham, </em>351 Mass. 375, 376-377 (1966). The order dismissing count one of the second amended complaint is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">(b) In counts two and four of the second amended complaint the abutters alleged that the planning board did not adhere to the town\u2019s recently adopted changes to its zoning code regard<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>ing the siting of PWS facilities,<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> nor did it require Southwestern Bell to do so. The new code includes a provision requiring special permit applicants to \u201cdemonstrate to the satisfaction of the Planning Board that the location of the tower is necessary and that the size and height is the minimum necessary for the purpose.\u201d Littleton Code, Zoning \u00a7 173-131(B)(8). The code also requires applicants to submit engineering reports concerning the specifications of the proposed tower design, and to support the asserted need for a tower at a proposed location. See Littleton Code, Zoning \u00a7 173-129(C). The abutters alleged that Southwestern Bell did not submit such engineering reports. Confining his review to the record before the planning board, the motion judge rejected these claims. These allegations raise disputed issues of fact, and will need to be resolved on the record to be developed on remand. The order dismissing counts two and four of the second amended complaint is vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">(c) At an annual meeting held on May 5 and 12, 1997, the board of selectmen of the town voted to lease a portion of the water department\u2019s property on Newtown Hill, the locus, for the siting of a PWS facility. On May 16, 1997, the selectmen signed an option and a ten-year lease agreement with Southwestern Bell. In counts five, six, and seven of their second amended complaint the abutters alleged in essence that the board of water commissioners improperly leased water department property for a use other than that for which it was taken by eminent domain, that the planning board\u2019s decision constituted an improper alteration of the use of the easement over conservation land in violation of art. 97 of the Amendments to the Massachusetts Constitution, and that the town\u2019s telecommunications zoning code constituted unlawful spot zoning.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> The abutters named neither the town nor the board of water commissioners as defendants in their second amended complaint. Southwestern Bell moved to dismiss these counts for failure to state a claim on which relief could be granted and for failure to name necessary parties. Mass. R. Civ. P. 12 (b) (6) and (7), 365 Mass. 754 (1974). The abutters responded with a motion for leave to amend <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>their complaint and a proposed third amended complaint naming the building commissioner of the town, the town, and the members of the board of water commissioners as defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">In his memorandum accompanying his order dismissing these counts the motion judge stated that he was taking no action on the motion to amend the complaint to add these parties, and would \u201cfor now ignore[] the fact that other parties are necessary for specific actions.\u201d The judge went on to conclude, however, that the town had acted within its authority when it leased the property, that the grant of the special permit did not, as a matter of law, constitute spot zoning,<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> and that the proposed increase in the use of the easement did not implicate art. 97 of the Amendments to the Massachusetts Constitution. On remand, the judge will be required to rule on the abutters\u2019 motion to amend their complaint for a third time. The dismissal of counts five, six, and seven of the second amended complaint is affirmed on the sole ground that parties necessary for an adjudication of these claims were not added. We express no view on the merits of the abutters\u2019 motion to amend their complaint to add any parties, except that any such motion should be considered in light of the purposes of the TCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">(d) In count eight of their second amended complaint the abutters alleged that the planning board was improperly biased in favor of Southwestern Bell, and that bias so permeated the planning board proceedings as to violate the abutters\u2019 due process rights.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> The judge concluded as a matter of law that \u201cany taint due to discussions of an idea to use the current <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>proposed site was overcome by the subsequent public meetings.\u201d The existing record does not substantiate the violation of any due process rights of the abutters under either the United States or the Massachusetts Constitutions. On remand, the abutters may introduce additional evidence, if any, relevant to this claim. The order dismissing count eight of the second amended complaint is vacated. .</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">(e) The abutters challenge the award of costs to Southwestern Bell and to the planning board. General Laws c. 40A, \u00a7 17, provides that an award of costs \u201cshall not be allowed against the party appealing from the decision\u201d of a planning board \u201cunless it shall appear to the court\u201d that the \u201cappellants acted in bad faith or with malice in mating the appeal to the court.\u201d The judge made no findings to that effect, and we see nothing in the record to suggest as much. In light of our disposition of this appeal, the award of costs is vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">The judgment of the Superior Court is affirmed in part and vacated in part.
