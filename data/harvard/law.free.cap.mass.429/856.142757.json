In October, 1995, the Department of Social Services (department) filed a report pursuant to G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 51A, alleging that the mother and child were staying in a house twice raided due to drag activity. The mother admitted to having a serious substance abuse problem and stated that she was to enter an abuse counselling center. The judge granted the department temporary custody. The child was returned to her mother two weeks later on condition that the mother remain at the substance abuse center. The two remained at the program until February, 1996. At that point, the mother ceased to communicate with the department and her whereabouts were unknown to the department. In August, 1996, the department located the mother and child. The department removed the child from the mother\u2019s custody and placed the child in foster care, where the child now resides. The mother failed to communicate with the department from August, 1996, until February 28, 1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-8\">In September, 1996, a Juvenile Court judge held a seventy-two hour hearing regarding the August custody transfer. Though served by summons, the mother failed to attend the hearing. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"858\">*858</page-number>The department filed a petition for permanent custody and, on February 20, 1997, the Juvenile Court judge held a hearing on the merits. The mother did not attend the hearing. The child was adjudicated in need of care and protection and committed to the permanent custody of the department pursuant to G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 26.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b878-5\">In February, 1997, the mother reestablished communication with the department. From March, 1997, until August, 1997, she submitted negative urine screens, attended Alcoholics Anonymous-Narcotics Anonymous meetings, and completed parenting classes. The mother also had three visits with the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-6\">After a September 2, 1997, visit with her child, the mother failed to communicate with the department. The mother did not reestablish communication with the department until May, 1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-7\">During the period when the mother did not communicate with the department, a trial was held on whether to dispense with the need for parental consent to adoption. The department presented the testimony of two witnesses and submitted sixteen exhibits in evidence. The mother did not attend.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-8\">In May, 1998, the mother filed a motion for visitation and a motion to reopen the evidence. After hearing, both motions were denied. In June, 1998, the mother filed a motion for reconsideration of the denial of her motion for visitation and a motion to reopen the evidence.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b878-9\">In June, 1998, the judge entered an order dispensing with the need for the mother\u2019s consent to the child\u2019s adoption. The mother filed a notice of appeal and filed a motion to stay the order. The judge denied the stay. The mother appealed and a single justice of the Appeals Court granted a stay. In July, 1998, the judge issued findings of fact and conclusions of law relating to the consent order.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-10\">In August, 1998, the mother filed a renewed motion for visitation. After hearing, the motion was denied. The mother filed a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"859\">*859</page-number>petition pursuant to G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3, before a single justice of this court seeking relief. Relief was denied. In September, 1998, the mother filed a petition for a review and redetermination hearing, pursuant to G. L. c. '119, \u00a7 26. After hearing, the motion was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-5\">We turn now to the merits of the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-6\">1. <em>Termination proceeding. </em>The mother and child challenge the decree dispensing with her consent to adoption pursuant to G. L. c. 210, \u00a7 3. They argue that the judge\u2019s findings are not supported by the evidence presented at the termination proceeding and do not provide clear and convincing evidence of parental unfitness. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-7\">To determine whether to dispense with parental consent to adoption, the judge must evaluate whether the parent can assume the duties and responsibilities required of a parent and whether dispensing with consent will be in the best interests of the child. See G. L. c. 210, \u00a7 3; <em>Adoption of Mary, </em>414 Mass. 705, 710 (1993). Before a judge may remove custody from a parent and award it to the department, the judge must find, by clear and convincing evidence, that the natural parent is unfit to further the welfare and best interests of the child. See <em>Care &amp; Protection of Stephen, </em>401 Mass. 144, 150 (1987); <em>Custody of Two Minors, </em>396 Mass. 610, 619 (1986). Subsidiary findings must be proved by a fair preponderance of the evidence. <em>Adoption of Quentin, </em>424 Mass. 882, 886 (1997). We will not disturb these findings absent a showing that they are clearly erroneous. <em>Petition of the Dep\u2019t of Social Servs. to Dispense with Consent to Adoption, </em>397 Mass. 659, 670 (1986). Even so, .we require that the judge\u2019s findings be specific and detailed, so as to demonstrate that close attention was given to the evidence. <em>Adoption of Hugo, </em>428 Mass. 219, 224 (1998). <em>Custody of a Minor (No. 1), </em>377 Mass. 876, 886 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b879-8\">We conclude that the department met its burden of proving parental unfitness by clear and convincing evidence. Although some of the judge\u2019s subsidiary findings were erroneous, the judge amply supported his conclusion that the mother is currently unfit to care for her child. The judge made fifty-nine findings that demonstrate a history of substance abuse, a pattern of late and missed appointments, failure to communicate her whereabouts to the department, and a minimal amount of com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"860\">*860</page-number>munication with the child over a significant period of time.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Nearly every finding was supported by the record which included the testimony of the department\u2019s social worker. The judge cited to the evidence in making nearly every finding. Specifically, he found that, after the mother\u2019s unsuccessful attempts to address her substance abuse problem and a 1994 incident of abandonment, the department was awarded custody of the child in 1997. The department did not know where the mother was, and the mother failed to appear at the temporary custody hearing or at the care and protection trial. When the mother did resurface a short time later, she repeatedly missed appointments with the department. The mother also failed to keep appointments to visit with her child, including a visit scheduled in June, 1997, for the child\u2019s fifth birthday. In September, 1997, the mother disappeared. She did not communicate with the department for eight months. From these facts, the judge could conclude the mother is unfit to parent her child.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-5\">The mother and child take issue with minute aspects of the judge\u2019s findings. For example, they point out that the dates of missed appointments and visits are unsupported. They also quibble with how long after a missed appointment the mother called the department, or exactly how late she was for visits.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-6\">We agree with the department that, although the judge\u2019s findings on these points may have been erroneous, the judge\u2019s overall conclusion of parental unfitness is fully supported by the record. The judge may have been mistaken regarding the dates of appointments, but the record shows a pervasive pattern of missed appointments and visits. The judge may have erred in describing how late the mother was for visits, but the mother does not disagree that she was late for visits and that weeks passed before she offered any explanation for her absence.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"861\">*861</page-number>agree with the judge that the evidence of the mother\u2019s unfitness was clear and convincing.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-5\">2. <em>Review and redetermination. </em>After the judge dispensed with the mother\u2019s consent to adoption pursuant to G. L. c. 210, \u00a7 3, the mother filed a petition for review and redetermination pursuant to G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 26. That petition was denied.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b881-6\">General Laws c. 1-19, \u00a7 26, governs review and redetermination hearings. That statute provides in part that \u201cthe department, parents, person having legal custody of, counsel for a child, the probation officer, guardian or guardian ad litem may petition the court not more than once every six months for a review and redetermination of the current needs of such child whose case has come before the court.\u201d This provision is, \u201cprimarily, the means by which a parent or other interested party, including the department, may bring to a judge\u2019s attention a change in the situation of a child, or of a child\u2019s parent, which might warrant reconsideration or modification of the original order adjudicating the child in need of care and protection.\u201d <em>Care &amp; Protection of Isaac, </em>419 Mass. 602, 611-612 (1995). The statute explicitly states that \u201cany person against whom a decree to dispense with consent to adoption has been entered . . . shall not have such right of petition for review and redetermination.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b882-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"862\">*862</page-number>Accepting the mother\u2019s stance and permitting posttrial review and redetermination hearings would contradict the language of the statute. Further, it would allow a parent who has been deemed unfit continually to interfere with the child, initiate multiple, repetitious litigation, and hinder and delay the eventual adoption of the child into a fit environment.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The judge followed the statute.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> There was no error.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b882-5\">3. <em>Visitation. </em>The trial judge denied the mother\u2019s motion for visitation pending appeal of the termination decree. The mother sought relief from the single justice. The single justice denied the petition. According to the mother, the right to consent to adoption is independent of the right to visitation. Relying on due process interests relating to the destruction of the parent-child relationship, public policy concerns about the creation of \u201clegal orphans,\u201d and visitation rights afforded a parent who has lost custody, she argues that the elimination of the right to consent does not extinguish her right to visitation. The mother asserts that the judge was required to make specific findings that visits would harm the child before terminating visitation. The judge focused on the best interests of the child and on parental unfitness. There was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-6\">In arguing that the judge was required to find harm to the child, the mother has failed to appreciate the differences between the parent-child relationship before and after the judge has dispensed with the parent\u2019s right to consent to adoption. In <em>Custody of a Minor (No. 2), </em>392 Mass. 719 (1984), we reviewed a decision awarding custody to the department and terminating visitation rights of the parents. Significantly, there had been no decision dispensing with consent to adoption. We stated that a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"863\">*863</page-number>judge should apply the same standard to visitation rights as he does to a permanent custody decision. Thus, before terminating such rights, \u201ca judge must make specific findings demonstrating that parental visits will harm the child or the public welfare.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 726.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-5\">In <em>Petition of Catholic Charitable Bureau of the Archdiocese of Boston, Inc., to Dispense with Consent to Adoption, </em>392 Mass. 738 (1984), we distinguished the level of review applied by the trial judge in making custody determinations from the test to be applied in termination proceedings. \u201cThe focus of [a termination] proceeding is not whether the parent should be deprived of \u2018custody\u2019 in order to safeguard the child\u2019s well-being, but rather whether \u2018it would be in the best interests of the child <em>for all legal relations [with the parent] to be ended\u2019 </em>(emphasis added). <em>Petition of the Dep\u2019t of Social Servs. to Dispense with Consent to Adoption, </em>391 Mass. 113, 119 (1984). Termination denies the natural parents physical custody, as well as the rights ever to visit, communicate with, or regain custody of the child.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 741, quoting <em>Santosky </em>v. <em>Kramer, </em>455 U.S. 745, 749, 753 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b883-6\">While posttermination visitation may be allowed, the proper focus is on the best interests of the child. Here, the judge properly dispensed with the mother\u2019s right to consent to adoption after determining that she was an unfit parent. The judge then declined to permit further visitation. There was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-7\">The mother next raises numerous arguments with regard to the trial judge\u2019s findings relating to the visitation motion. She complains that the judge erred by relying on an affidavit of a department attorney, not admitted in evidence, and by relying on oral proffers of department attorneys. She also asserts that the findings were not supported by the record and that the judge abused his discretion by ignoring evidence related to the parent-child relationship, while relying on the department\u2019s proposed findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-8\">We agree that the judge should not have cited the proffers or the affidavit in his findings as neither was admitted in evidence. We conclude, however, that a new hearing is not warranted. The judge was intimately familiar with the details of this parent-child relationship. He made numerous findings when he dispensed with the mother\u2019s consent to adoption. He then cited many of those findings in deciding this motion. Discounting the proffers and the affidavit, the findings show, that the mother <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"864\">*864</page-number>repeatedly abandoned the child; had a persistent substance abuse problem; and failed to attend meetings, visits, and court proceedings. The findings also reflect that the judge considered the mother\u2019s attempts to fight her substance abuse problem. The findings, on the whole, are supported by the record, and support the judge\u2019s decision not to permit visitation.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The judge did not err in denying the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-5\">4. <em>The stay. </em>Relying on the general rule that a stay serves \u201cto preserve the rights of the parties during the pendency of an appeal,\u201d Reporters\u2019 Notes to Mass. R. A. P. 6, Mass. Laws Ann., Rules of Appellate Procedure 35 (Lexis 1997), the mother next argues that a stay of the decree dispensing with consent,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> issued by a single justice of the Appeals Court, preserves her rights to visitation and a review and redetermination hearing pending appeal.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> See <em>Turner Broadcasting Sys., Inc. </em>v. <em>FCC, </em>507 U.S. 1301, 1302 (1993) (Rehnquist, C.J., in chambers), quoting <em>Ohio Citizens for Responsible Energy, Inc. </em>v. <em>NRC, </em>479 U.S. 1312, 1313 (1986) (Scalia, L, in chambers) (stay \u201ctemporarily suspends \u2018judicial alteration of the status quo\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b884-6\">Where, as here, the best interests of the child are the judge\u2019s sole concern, we conclude that the stay does not revive visitation rights which were largely ignored by the mother prior to trial. It would be anomalous to permit a parent found to be unfit to continue a parent-child relationship pending appeal without a specific order for visitation and factual findings as to why visitation pending appeal would be in the best interests of the child. \u201cTermination denies the natural parents physical custody, as well as the rights ever to visit, communicate with, or regain custody of the child.\u201d <em>Petition of Catholic Charitable Bureau, supra </em>at 741. Here, the judge had the matter before him for over two years and determined that there was a record of abandonment, substance abuse, failure to attend meetings and visits, and tardiness in visits. On these facts, the judge did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"865\">*865</page-number>err in concluding that visitation pending appeal was not in the child\u2019s best interest. The stay simply prevents the department from asking the court to allow the adoption of the child pending appeal.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b885-5\">The judgment dispensing with the mother\u2019s consent to adoption is affirmed. The judgment of the single justice denying relief pursuant to G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3, is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b877-9\">The child joins in the appeal of the judgment dispensing with the mother\u2019s consent to adoption. The child purports to join in the appeal from the denial of the mother\u2019s request for a review and redetermination hearing. Although the child was (and is) entitled to file a petition for review and redetermination, the child did not do so. Further, the child did not join in the mother\u2019s petition. See note 8, <em>infra. </em>On appeal, the child has filed a brief as an amicus curiae.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b877-10\">The mother sought to appeal under S.J.C. Rule 2:21, 421 Mass. 1303 (1995), from the denial of relief by the single justice. We concluded that rule 2:21 was not applicable and stated the mother\u2019s appeal could be pursued \u201caccording to the regular appellate process.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b878-11\">The mother filed a notice of appeal from that judgment, but the appeal was not pursued.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b878-12\">According to the mother, she has participated in substance abuse meetings and drug screenings since April, 1998; attended drug counseling since May, 1998; completed parenting classes and courses toward her high school equivalency certificate; and has been employed since March, 1998. Since May, 1998, the mother has requested weekly visitation with the child, but the requests have been denied.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b880-7\">Although the findings are numbered one through sixty-nine, finding thirty-three is followed by finding forty-four. This gap does not affect the substance of the findings. The findings follow logically.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b880-8\">A small number of the judge\u2019s fifty-nine findings included material he had admitted only to set the stage and not for its truth. Some of these findings are supported by other evidence. None is critical to the judge\u2019s over-all conclusion of parental unfitness.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-9\">The mother and child also complain that the judge ignored the mother\u2019s progress in her relationship with her child and in overcoming her substance abuse problems. However, \u201cthe judge\u2019s assessment of the weight of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"861\">*861</page-number>evidence and the credibility of the witnesses is entitled to deference.\u201d <em>Custody of Two Minors, </em>396 Mass. 610, 618 (1986). The findings reflect a determination by the judge that the department\u2019s social worker was credible.</p>\n<p id=\"Amq\">Finally, the mother and child challenge the judge\u2019s assessment of three of the thirteen factors contained in G. L. c. 210, \u00a7 3. The department admits that the judge\u2019s findings as to two of the factors were erroneous. Those factors include \u201cthe willful failure to support the child where the child is not in the custody of the parent\u201d and \u201cthe conviction of a parent ... of a felony offense that the court finds is of such a nature that the child will be deprived of a stable home for a period of years.\u201d The remaining finding at issue, regarding the parent\u2019s absence or ability to meet the child\u2019s needs and the bond with the substitute caretaker, was supported by the record. We conclude that the judge adequately weighed the factors.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b881-14\">The mother and child concede that the mother alone filed this petition. However, they argue that the child supported this petition, that \u201cfor all intents and purposes [it was] a joint petition, and the trial [judge] treated it as such.\u201d Further, they note that the child appealed from the denial of the petition. We disagree with the characterization of this as a joint petition. While the child was (and is) entitled to seek a hearing under this provision, the child did not so petition. Thus, the child has no basis for appealing from the denial of the petition.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b882-7\">In <em>Adoption of Inez, </em>428 Mass. 717, 723 (1999), quoting <em>Adoption of Paula, </em>420 Mass. 716, 731 (1995), we recognized that \u201c[a] judge, when deciding whether to dispense with consent to adoption, \u2018must focus on present circumstances . . . and, in appropriate cases, the likelihood of future improvement, in a parent\u2019s ability to care for the child.\u2019 \u201d See <em>Adoption of Carlos, </em>413 Mass. 339, 350 (1992). This rule, however, does not give a parent unfettered access to a review and redetermination proceeding after the court has dispensed with consent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b882-8\">Contrary to the mother\u2019s contention, there is no indication that the judge was punishing the mother by refusing to grant her a review and redetermination hearing. Rather the judge correctly followed the words of the statute.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b882-9\">After trial, but before the judgment was entered, the mother filed a motion for a new trial. On appeal, she relies on the same arguments raised in appealing from the review and redetermination decision. The mother also filed a motion to reopen the evidence. The denial of that motion is not argued on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b884-7\">The mother\u2019s assertion that the judge ignored evidence that the visits which did occur were \u201cjoyful, not harmful, to the child\u201d does not alter our result. The judge was free to accept or reject this evidence. In view of the record as a whole, the findings and conclusion that visitation was not in the child\u2019s best interests were supported.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b884-8\">The order states: \u201cThe order dispensing with consent to adoption entered June 26, 1998 ... is stayed pending further order of this court or a single justice thereof.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b884-9\">We note that, while this issue is technically moot, it is likely to arise in other cases. We therefore address it here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b885-7\">We reject the mother\u2019s assertion that the stay preserves her rights to review and redetermination.
