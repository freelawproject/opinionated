The underlying facts are not in dispute. Nashoba is a limited partnership which, at all times relevant to this appeal, owned and operated a cable television system in Danvers. For fiscal year 1990, the board of assessors of Danvers (assessors) valued personal property owned by Nashoba at $2,220,300 and assessed a tax on this property. On January 5, 1990, Nashoba filed an application for abatement of personal property tax, claiming that its cable and other electronic equipment located over public ways, property for which it was assessed, was exempt from taxation. The assessors denied the application.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-13\">The parties agree that, if the property at issue is taxable, then the assessment was correct. The board concluded that, under G. L. c. 59, \u00a7 18, the property was not exempt from local taxa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>tion. Nashoba appealed. We transferred the case here on our own motion and now affirm the decision of the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">The dispute centers around G. L. c. 59, \u00a7 18, which provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-6\">\u201cAll taxable personal estate within or without the commonwealth shall be assessed to the owner in the town where he is an inhabitant on January first, except as provided in chapter sixty-three and in the following clauses of this section: . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-7\">\u201cFifth, Underground conduits, wires and pipes laid in public ways, except such as are owned by a street railway company, and poles, underground conduits and pipes, together with the wires thereon or therein, laid in or erected upon private property or in a railroad location by any corporation, except poles, underground conduits, wires and pipes of a railroad corporation laid in or erected upon the location of such railroad, and except poles, underground conduits, wires and pipes laid in or erected upon any right of way owned by a street railway company, shall be assessed to the owners thereof in the towns where laid or erected.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-8\">\u201cSixth, Partners, whether residing in the same or different towns, shall be jointly taxed under their firm name, for all tangible personal property belonging to the partnership, except ships and vessels used in or designed for use in carrying trade or commercial fishing, in the place where such property is situated. Each partner shall be liable for the whole tax.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b147-9\">In <em>Warner Amex Cable Communications Inc. </em>v. <em>Assessors of Everett, </em>396 Mass. 239 (1985), this court reiterated its prior conclusion that G. L. c. 59, \u00a7 18, Fifth, \u201cmakes no provision for the taxation of poles with the wires thereon erected on public ways.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 241, quoting <em>Assessors of Springfield </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Corps. &amp; Taxation, </em>321 Mass. 186, 194 (1947).</p>\n<p id=\"b147-10\">By specifically referring to pipe and wires of corporations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>laid in public ways and in or on private property, the statute gives rise to the inference cited by the court that such property located on a public way is not included. In both cases the taxpayers claiming the benefit of this exemption were corporations. See <em>Warner Amex Cable Communications Inc., supra </em>at 241 n.3; <em>Assessors of Springfield, supra </em>at 187. Nashoba is organized as a limited partnership.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">In rejecting Nashoba\u2019s suggestion that this distinction is irrelevant the board noted that \u00a7 18, Sixth, specifically addresses taxation of \u201call tangible personal property belonging to the partnership\u201d (emphasis added). In contrast, \u00a7 18, Fifth, pertains to \u201c[underground conduits, wires and pipes laid in public ways . . . and poles, underground conduits and pipes, together with the wires thereon or therein, laid in or erected upon private property <em>. . . by any corporation . . </em>.\u201d (emphasis in board\u2019s decision).</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">The board reasoned that, because clause Fifth specifically refers to property of corporations and clause Sixth to partnership property, it would be a strained construction to conclude that clause Fifth was also meant to apply to certain partnership property. We agree. The provisions of \u00a7 18, Fifth, apply to corporations not partnerships.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-7\">Nashoba next argues that construing G. L. c. 59, \u00a7 18, as taxing partnerships but exempting corporations for the same property, is constitutionally discriminatory and denies partners equal protection of the laws. We disagree. In <em>Massachusetts Teachers Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>Secretary of the Commonwealth, </em>384 Mass. 209 (1981), we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-8\">\u201c \u2018A classification by a Legislature of property and persons for the purpose of taxation is not violative of . . . [the equal protection] clause of the Fourteenth Amendment [to the United States Constitution] so long as any basis of fact can be reasonably conceived showing that the distinction upon which it rests has a fair and rational relation to the object sought to be accomplished by the enactment, and so long as, the classification being valid, the State deals equally with all the members of the same class.\u2019. . . A State\u2019s scope of discretion is especially wide in the field of taxation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b148-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 240, quoting <em>Frost </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Corps. &amp; Taxation, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>363 Mass. 235, 248, appeal dismissed, 414 U.S. 803 (1973), and cases cited. We note that both the Federal and Massachusetts taxing schemes treat corporations and partnerships differently. Furthermore, if any inequality exists in this treatment, it can be avoided because it is the taxpayer\u2019s option to operate as a partnership or to do business as a corporation. Furthermore, as the board noted, G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 30, imposes a corporate excise, in part, on the value of a corporation\u2019s tangible personal property not subject to local taxation. There is no comparable provision providing for State taxation of a partnership\u2019s personal property.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">We affirm the decision of the Appellate Tax Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b147-11\">We note that, as in <em>Warner Amex Cable Communications Inc. </em>v. <em>Assessors of Everett, 396 </em>Mass. 239, 240 n.2 (1985), neither the board nor the assessors have relied on the introductory language of \u00a7 18 or on \u00a7 18, First, to justify the assessors\u2019 right to assess the property at issue in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
