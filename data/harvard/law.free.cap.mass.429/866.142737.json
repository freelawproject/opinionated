His probation was revoked following a hearing at which he was not present because he was serving a 151-month sentence in Federal prison for bank robbery. We transferred the case to this court on our own motion. We vacate the revocation of his probation and conclude that a new hearing is required as a matter of Federal constitutional law.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-15\">In 1990, after a trial held in Middlesex Superior Court, the defendant was convicted of armed robbery. He was sentenced to from fifteen to twenty years, eight years to be served, the balance suspended with a five-year probationary term. In 1995, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"867\">*867</page-number>defendant\u2019s probation was transferred to Suffolk County. Shortly thereafter, the probation department issued a notice of surrender based on the defendant\u2019s further involvement in criminal activity. A preliminary surrender hearing was held in December, 1995, at which counsel was appointed to represent the defendant at the final probation revocation hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-5\">In June, 1996, before the final probation revocation hearing was held, the defendant pleaded guilty in Federal District Court to the charge of bank robbery and was sentenced to 151 months (more than twelve years) in prison.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He must serve at least eighty-five per cent of the Federal sentence, which amounts to almost eleven years. In August, 1996, the final hearing was held in the absence of the defendant, who already had begun serving his Federal sentence. The Superior Court had made several attempts to secure the defendant\u2019s presence at the hearing by asking the United States marshal and the United States marshal\u2019s representative.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The attempts were unsuccessful. The record does not explain why the Federal authorities refused to cooperate with the Superior Court. Such a refusal is troubling.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-6\">Because the Federal authorities would not produce the defendant, the hearing was conducted in his absence. Over defense counsel\u2019s objection, the judge determined that the defendant was in violation of his probation, revoked the probation, and imposed the original sentence, to be served from and after the Federal sentence. The judge retained jurisdiction, ordering the defendant to appear for sentencing on the expiration of his Federal sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-7\">The defendant\u2019s probation revocation must be vacated because his constitutional right to be heard in person at the hearing was violated.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The United States Supreme Court has held that the \u201cminimum requirements of due process\u201d demand that the defendant be afforded the \u201copportunity to be heard in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"868\">*868</page-number>person\u201d at his probation revocation hearing. <em>Morrissey </em>v. <em>Brewer, </em>408 U.S. 471, 489 (1972) (specifying requirements for parole revocation hearing). See <em>Gagnon </em>v. <em>Scarpelli, </em>411 U.S. 778, 782 (1973) (holding that probation revocation hearing must be conducted under conditions specified in <em>Morrissey, supra).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b888-5\">Although a revocation of probation is not part of a criminal prosecution, see <em>Gagnon, supra </em>at 781; <em>Morrissey, supra </em>at 480, the Supreme Court described \u201cthe loss of liberty entailed\u201d by the revocation as \u201ca serious deprivation.\u201d <em>Gagnon, supra. </em>The Supreme Court therefore concluded that, at a minimum, a defendant has the right to be heard in person. See <em>Gagnon, supra </em>at 782; <em>Morrissey, supra </em>at 489. The defendant .was not afforded this right.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-6\">The Commonwealth concedes that holding the hearing in the defendant\u2019s absence was error, but argues that the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> See <em>Arizona </em>v. <em>Fulminante, </em>499 U.S. 279, 306 (1991). We do not agree. Because of the defendant\u2019s absence, he had no chance to challenge the revocation of probation through testimony. He also could not testify to or offer evidence of changed or mitigating circumstances that would warrant a lesser sentence, a concurrent sentence (if possible), or dismissal. Thus, the error cannot be said to be harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-7\">The Commonwealth alternatively argues that \u201cthe defendant voluntarily, impliedly, and effectively waived his presence\u201d at the hearing by his plea to the Federal charge when he knew that the revocation proceeding was pending.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> A probationer may knowingly and voluntarily waive his right of presence at his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"869\">*869</page-number>final probation revocation hearing. See <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>United States, </em>414 U.S. 17, 20 (1973) (per curiam) (defendant\u2019s voluntary absence from trial constitutes waiver); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Flemmi, </em>360 Mass. 693, 694 (1971) (same). We conclude that there was no waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-5\">The Commonwealth relies on <em>State </em>v. <em>Durkin, </em>219 Conn. 629 (1991). In <em>Durkin, </em>the defendant appeared for the commencement of his probation revocation hearing. <em>Id. </em>at 632. After the State presented its case, the defendant requested and was granted a continuance. <em>Id. </em>Before the next hearing, the defendant left the State and was sentenced and incarcerated on an unrelated charge in another State. <em>Id. </em>Looking at the totality of the circumstances, the Supreme Court of Connecticut concluded that the defendant voluntarily waived his right to be present. <em>Id. </em>at 639-640. The court reasoned that the defendant\u2019s departure from the State, which was prohibited by his probation, and his election to submit to the other State\u2019s authorities were the product of the defendant\u2019s free, uncompelled choice. <em>Id. </em>at 640. Further, the court stressed that the defendant knew that the hearing was scheduled to continue and that he was obliged to appear. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b889-6\">The circumstances of the case before us differ markedly from those in <em>Durkin. </em>The defendant\u2019s decision to plead guilty to Federal charges is far different from Durkin\u2019s decision to leave the jurisdiction during a continuance that was granted at his request. Durkin made an agreement with the judge to appear in three weeks\u2019 time; no such agreement was made by the defendant here. There is no evidence that the defendant knew when his hearing was to take place. In addition, there is no indication that the defendant had any reason to believe that the Federal authorities would not make him available for the hearing when it did occur.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b889-7\">We recognize that our holding places an appreciable burden on the Commonwealth. Without the cooperation of Federal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"870\">*870</page-number>authorities, the Commonwealth must wait until the Federal sentence is served before presenting its case for revoking the defendant\u2019s probation.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Apparently, that is the only way the Commonwealth can secure the defendant\u2019s presence at the hearing.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The failure of Federal authorities to cooperate with the Commonwealth provides no other alternative. We therefore vacate the revocation of the defendant\u2019s probation and remand for a new hearing conducted with the defendant present at the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b887-8\">The fact that the defendant pleaded guilty to the Federal charge was not part of the original record. The Commonwealth submitted the judgment in the Federal case with its motion to expand the record, which we hereby allow.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b887-9\">The Superior Court made each request in the form of a writ of habeas corpus. Federal authorities may refuse to honor State-issued writs. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Mauro, </em>436 U.S. 340, 359-361 (1978).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b887-10\">In addition to asserting his Federal constitutional rights, the defendant also argues that, if Federal constitutional law does not require his presence at the probation revocation hearing, we should rule that art. 12 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights does. We do not discuss art. 12 because Federal law requires that the defendant be present.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b888-8\">The United States Supreme Court never has said that such an error is subject to the harmless beyond a reasonable doubt principle. We assume, for the purpose of this opinion, that the principle is applicable.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b888-9\">The Commonwealth further argues that the defendant\u2019s lawyer objected to the defendant\u2019s absence too late in the proceeding to preserve his rights. According to the transcript, however, defense counsel voiced his objection the first time he spoke at the hearing. As soon as the judge responded that he intended to revoke the defendant\u2019s probation, defense counsel again objected to the defendant\u2019s absence. We conclude that defense counsel timely objected.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-10\">There was some disagreement at oral argument as to whether the hearing was a probation revocation hearing or a motion to dismiss. We have treated it as a probation revocation hearing because it is termed a \u201cfinal surrender hearing\u201d in the Superior Court docket, and the defendant\u2019s original sentence was reimposed from and after the Federal sentence. The judge did retain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"869\">*869</page-number>jurisdiction to give the defendant an opportunity to appear and argue that the State sentence should not be from and after the Federal sentence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b889-10\">Other cases holding that a waiver occurred are similarly distinguishable on their facts. See <em>Giles </em>v. <em>Irvin, </em>914 F. Supp. 957, 959 (W.D.N.Y. 1996) (probationer appeared but left courtroom before hearing began); <em>Parrish </em>v. <em>State, </em>65 Ark. App. 66, 71 (1999) (same); <em>People </em>v. <em>Klovstad, </em>168 Ill. App. 3d 444, 448 (1988) (probationer, who had been advised of hearing date and admonished that hearing would take place in his absence if he failed to appear, claimed he was sick, but failed to notify court for nearly six months); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"870\">*870</page-number><em>Chase </em>v. <em>State, </em>309 Md. 224, 236 (1987) (probationer absent during only a portion of hearing and his attorney failed to object).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b890-8\">The record does not reflect what effect the on and after sentence and the Commonwealth\u2019s detainer will have on the defendant while in Federal prison.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b890-9\">The Interstate Agreement on Detainers, 18 U.S.C. Appendix 2, \u00a7 2 (1994), entered into by the Federal government and the States, is not available for probation violation charges. See <em>Carchman </em>v. <em>Nash, </em>473 U.S. 716, 725 (1985). See also St. 1965, c. 892, \u00a7 1. Congress evidently did not contemplate a lack of cooperation, without explanation, by Federal authorities with the States.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
