In its brief to the Appeals Court, the Commonwealth conceded that its proof was insufficient to convict the defendant on four of the indictments, and that, as a consequence, he was entitled to a required finding of not guilty on those charges. The Appeals Court, in an unpublished memorandum and order entered pursuant to that court\u2019s rule 1:28, entered judgment for the defendant on the charges on which the Commonwealth had conceded a lack of proof, rejected the defendant\u2019s other arguments, and affirmed his remaining convictions. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Peters, </em>45 Mass. App. Ct. 1101 (1998). We granted the defendant\u2019s application for further appellate review. We conclude that his motion for a required finding of not guilty was correctly denied on two of the four Douglas indictments which are still disputed, but that there must be a new trial because of improper fresh complaint testimony and instructions to the jury concerning it.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-6\">1. The defendant argues that the complainant\u2019s testimony as to two of the four incidents that were asserted to have occurred in Douglas was replete with contradiction, uncertainty, and vacillation, to the point where no rational trier of fact could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that more than two acts of sexual assault occurred in Douglas. We have examined the complainant\u2019s testimony. She testified in explicit detail as to two incidents of sexual assault in Douglas, and went on to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>testify that \u201cafter [the] first two incidents,\u201d the defendant put \u201chis fingers up my vagina, his hands on my breasts, and touch[ed] my vagina.\u201d Inconsistencies in a complainant\u2019s testimony will not render it insufficient, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Clary, </em>388 Mass. 583, 589 (1983), and \u201c[i]t does not matter that some of the evidence could be characterized as equivocal or contradictory.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Melchionno, </em>29 Mass. App. Ct. 939, 940 (1990). The proof as to the third and fourth incidents in Douglas could be found in the testimony quoted above. When considered with the complainant\u2019s other testimony about events in Douglas, the evidence was sufficient under the standards set forth in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Latimore, </em>378 Mass. 671, 677-678 (1979), to warrant submission of the two Douglas indictments in issue (indictment nos. 94-0047-1 and 94-0047-10) to the jury. The defendant\u2019s motion for a required finding of not guilty on these indictments was correctly denied.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">2. The background information pertinent to the problem with the fresh complaint evidence is as follows. During jury empanelment, the judge informed the jury that, among other potential witnesses, Patricia Savelli from the Department of Social Services and Marian MacLean, from the Massachusetts State police might be called to testify. The name of Mary Hemming, a guidance counsellor at the complainant\u2019s high school was not mentioned as a potential witness. Savelli, MacLean, and Hemming, if called to testify, would have been fresh complaint witnesses. In his opening statement, the prosecutor told the jury that the defendant\u2019s alleged sexual abuse continued through the fall of 1993, when the complainant \u201cafter speaking to several friends,\u201d disclosed what had been happening to her to Mary Hemming, her high school guidance counsellor with whom the complainant had \u201cdeveloped a relationship.\u201d The prosecutor went on to state that \u201cthereafter [the complainant] spoke to several people from the Department of Social Services . . . [and] to a trooper from the Massachusetts State police\u201d about the abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-6\">The complainant was called as the Commonwealth\u2019s first witness, and she testified, on direct examination, in explicit detail, about all the acts of sexual assault and abuse committed by the defendant. When she had completed her description of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>sexual abuse, and its details, the prosecutor elicited from the complainant that she had told a \u201ccouple of kids on [her] soccer team\u201d about the abuse. The prosecutor then went on to ask the complainant about her visits to Hemming, her high school guidance counsellor. The complainant testified that she felt \u201ccomfortable in talking\u201d with Hemming, and near the end of November, 1993, told Flemming \u201csome of the details of the things the defendant had done to [her] . . . because [she] was sick of [the defendant\u2019s] doing this to [her].\u201d During the testimony, the defendant\u2019s trial counsel made a general objection, and he explained to the judge, at the conclusion of the evidence for the day, that the objection to the complainant\u2019s testimony of her conversations with Flemming was \u201con the basis as to whether it was a fresh complaint.\u201d After the complainant had completed this aspect of her testimony, the judge gave the jury (without objection) the instruction set forth below.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b45-5\">In his cross-examination of the complainant, the defendant\u2019s trial counsel elicited testimony that in November, 1993, the complainant had spoken to Patricia Savelli with the Department of Social Services and told Savelli that the defendant would \u201cstop before penetrating [her] because [she was] usually crying, and he was afraid it would wake up [her] mother\u201d; that she and the defendant had \u201cactual sexual intercourse, penis in the vagina . . . only one time last summer\u201d; and that \u201cthe very night before [the complainant\u2019s speaking to Savelli, the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>had] tried to have sex with [her],\u201d but he had not succeeded because she \u201cstruggled with him,\u201d and during the struggle, he had \u201cgrabbed [her] by the neck.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">On redirect examination of the complainant, the prosecutor, over objection by the defendant\u2019s trial counsel, further explored what the complainant had told Savelli, and had her repeat some of her testimony on direct examination about her relationship with Flemming. The prosecutor then brought out that the complainant had written a letter to Flemming in which she stated that \u201cevery time my mother is out of the house . . . [the defendant] rapes me,\u201d and it \u201chappened ... on more than one occasion.\u201d The defendant\u2019s trial counsel made no objection as to content to this testimony, and the letter was not offered in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-6\">The Commonwealth\u2019s evidence closed with the testimony of the complainant\u2019s mother. Neither Flemming nor Savelli was called as a witness.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> There was no motion made by the defendant\u2019s trial counsel to strike any of the complainant\u2019s testimony about the details of the complaint as expressed by her. The prosecutor made reference in his closing argument to the complainant\u2019s contact with Flemming, with no objection. In addition, the defendant\u2019s trial counsel made reference to the complainant\u2019s conversations with both Flemming and Savelli in his closing argument. In her final charge to the jury, the judge repeated, in slightly different terms, her earlier instruction on the complainant\u2019s fresh complaint testimony, see note 3, <em>supra, </em>to which she added the remarks set forth below.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> There was no objection to the instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-7\">The defendant contends that the manner in which the fresh complaint evidence was introduced, and handled by the judge, improperly permitted the complainant to corroborate herself, and, as a consequence, a new trial is required. We agree. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>first discuss the law pertaining to fresh complaint evidence and why there was error here, and then state the reasons why a new triad is necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">(a) Our fresh complaint doctrine permits an out-of-court complaint seasonably made by the complainant in a sexual assault case to be admitted as part of the prosecution\u2019s case-in-chief.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Evidence of the fact of the complaint is admissible only to corroborate the complainant\u2019s testimony. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bailey, </em>370 Mass. 388, 391-392 (1976), and cases cited. It cannot be used to establish the truth of the complaint itself. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lavalley, </em>410 Mass. 641, 643 (1991). In Massachusetts, unlike most jurisdictions, a fresh complaint witness may testify both to the fact of the complaint and the details of the complaint as expressed by the complainant.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> See <em>id. </em>at 643 &amp; n.4; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bailey, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lavalley, supra </em>at 646-647 n.7, and in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Licata, </em>412 Mass. 654, 657-658 (1992), we expressed concern about the fresh complaint doctrine. We noted that the doctrine was based on the outmoded, and arguably invalid, premise that victims of a sexual assault who complained to others were truthful, while victims who did not complain may have remained silent because they had consented to the sexual contact. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lavalley, supra. </em>Despite our reservations about the doctrine, we stated in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Licata, supra </em>at 658, that \u201c[w]e cannot ignore the societal tendency to disbelieve sexual assault victims and to presume that [those] victimfs] will make a prompt complaint.\u201d We went on to affirm that fresh complaint evidence should remain admissible both as to the fact of the complaint and its details, so that the jury could draw their own conclusions based on the statements. See <em>id. </em>at 658-659. We advised judges that they \u201cshould be cautious in admitting evidence of a fresh complaint,\u201d <em>id. </em>at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>660; that they should carefully instruct the jury on the role of fresh complaint evidence when it is admitted and again in the final charge so that the jury do not improperly consider it as substantive evidence, <em>id.; </em>and that they should exercise discretion to prevent the needless repetition of details. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">The reasons why fresh complaint evidence must be handled with care were explained by the Supreme Court of Connecticut in <em>State </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>244 Conn. 640, 645 (1998), when that court recognized that the fresh complaint doctrine creates \u201ca tension between competing well recognized principles.\u201d The court went on to describe the tension, and the manner in which it can be relieved, in these terms: \u201c[The fresh complaint doctrine] remains a powerful weapon in the state\u2019s arsenal-to secure justice for victims of sexual assaults. It also, however, constitutes a potential threat to the accused\u2019s right of confrontation under the sixth amendment to the constitution of the United States [and the analogous provision of the State Constitution], To resolve this tension, the defendant must be allowed an adequate opportunity to cross-examine [fresh complaint] witnesses. Such cross-examination properly includes questioning the witness not only about the victim\u2019s report of the present charge, but also about the victim\u2019s prior false statements, to that witness, that tend to undermine the credibility of the victim\u2019s present complaint.\u201d (Footnote omitted.) <em>Id. </em>at 645-646.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">These observations confirm the obvious proposition that, while a complainant may testify about the fact that she made a complaint to another about a sexual assault, the person complained to, the fresh complaint witness, must be produced to testify about what the complainant said and to be available for cross-examination. We can find no decision, or other authority, which permits a complainant to engage in self-corroboration.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-7\">The Commonwealth refers to <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bailey, supra, </em>and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Scullin, </em>44 Mass. App. Ct. 9 (1997), as justifying self-corroboration by a victim of a sexual assault. These decisions do not so hold. In the <em>Bailey </em>case, in highlighting the fact that only in rape cases do we admit, in the prosecution\u2019s case-in-chief, testimony regarding out-of-court statements that are repetitive of a victim\u2019s trial testimony, we said, \u201c[i]n cases of rape, however, testimony reporting statements made by the victim shortly after the attack are universally admitted to corroborate the victim\u2019s testimony.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bailey, supra </em>at 392, and cases cited. This statement does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>mean that the \u201ctestimony\u201d may be reported by the victim herself, which is made plain by the statement\u2019s context, regarding testimony by a police officer regarding the victim\u2019s complaint to her; the cases cited, which both included testimony by witnesses other than the victim (see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hanger, </em>357 Mass. 464, 466 [1970] [police officer testified]; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ellis, </em>319 Mass. 627, 629 [1946], <em>S.C., </em>321 Mass. 669 [1947] [mother and police officer testified]); and our subsequent statement that the defendant may use any discrepancies in the corroborating testimony to \u201cdiscredit the victim.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bailey, supra </em>at 396.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">In the <em>Scullin </em>case, the Appeals Court examined a charge of ineffective assistance of counsel in the context of a rape conviction. The trial judge had deferred a decision as to whether a friend of the complainant would be allowed to testify about the complaint to her. The friend never testified. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Scullin, supra </em>at 10. In its decision, the Appeals Court sought to determine why defense counsel made no objection to the complainant\u2019s testimony detailing her complaint to her friend, when its admissibility was questionable. The court stated, \u201cSuch testimony, while not typical fresh complaint evidence (i.e., it was not related by a third party to whom the report was made), nonetheless is evidence of an out-of-court statement corroborating an allegation of rape, and so was admissible here, <em>if at all, </em>only under the rubric of fresh complaint\u201d (emphasis added). <em>Id. </em>at 11-12. The court then cited four cases that might support an inference that the complainant\u2019s testimony was admissible as a fresh complaint, but in all four cases, a fresh complaint witness testified in addition to the victim. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Izzo, </em>359 Mass. 39, 44 (1971) (victim\u2019s mother); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ellis, supra </em>(same); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cleary, </em>172 Mass. 175, <em>177 </em>(1898) (same); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Leroux, </em>12 Mass. App. Ct. 886, 887 (1981) (victim\u2019s statement as to what she had told another \u201cwas cumulative . . . and merely a reiteration of other testimony properly admitted as fresh complaint\u201d). In a footnote, the Appeals Court pointedly stated: \u201cWe note also that the Commonwealth does not dispute this characterization of the victim\u2019s testimony as fresh complaint.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Scullin, supra </em>at 12 n.3. The Appeals Court\u2019s statements do not stand for the proposition that the victim\u2019s testimony as to the details of her complaint was admissible, especially in light of the fact that the court concluded that defense counsel\u2019s failure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>to object to the testimony was a deficiency in performance. See <em>id. </em>at 11.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">We take this opportunity to state the governing principles on the matter. The complainant in a sexual assault case may testify <em>only </em>to the fact that a fresh complaint was made and to whom it was made. The complainant should not be allowed to testify about the details of the complaint. Defense counsel may, if he or she chooses, cross-examine the complainant about the details of the complaint. If defense counsel does so, the prosecutor may then go into the details in appropriate redirect examination. Otherwise, testimony as to the details of the complaint should be left to the fresh complaint witness who heard the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-6\">These principles strike a balance between our concerns .* ut the fresh complaint doctrine and the fact that we contir. \u25a0 \"&gt; adhere to the distinctly minority position that the details complaint can be admitted through the testimony of a ; complaint witness.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Judges, therefore, should make sure in frn cases that these principles are applied. A review of transcripts prior cases reveals that the principles have not always bet consistently followed. We hasten to point out, however, that, even if a complainant has been permitted to testify to the details of a fresh complaint in a past case, the defendant may not have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>incurred prejudice. The testimony as to details, for example, may be cumulative or merely a reiteration of other testimony properly admitted as fresh complaint. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Leroux, supra </em>at 887. There may be other reasons as well that establish lack of any prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">Because the fresh complaint doctrine is not operative until fresh complaint testimony from someone other than the complainant is properly introduced, the manner of self-corroboration in this case was erroneous. The complainant was permitted to testify to the details of the complaint. We now state our reasons for ordering a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">(b) The defendant\u2019s trial counsel did not object to the introduction of the complainant\u2019s testimony that she told members of her soccer team about the sexual abuse. He did not preserve an adequate objection to the complainant\u2019s testimony concerning her communications with Hemming about the abuse. Further, the defendant\u2019s trial counsel made no motion to strike that testimony when the Commonwealth rested, and he reiterated the substance of the complainant\u2019s conversations with Hemming in his closing argument. The defendant\u2019s trial counsel voiced no objection to the judge\u2019s instructions to the jury about the fresh complaint testimony.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The defendant now argues that his trial counsel provided him with ineffective assistance, and a new trial is required.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> We conclude, under the State constitutional standards set forth in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Saferian, </em>366 Mass. 89, 96-97 (1974), that the defendant is entitled to the relief he seeks.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b51-7\">(i) The \u201cordinary fallible lawyer\u201d would have recognized that objections should have been made to the complainant\u2019s testimony about the soccer team, and her testimony concerning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>the substance of her conversations with Flemming. The prosecutor should have given assurances that the fresh complaint witnesses, including Flemming (who was not on the witness list) would be called to testify about the details. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sugrue, </em>34 Mass. App. Ct. 172, 173-175 (1993) (failure of trial counsel to object to testimony of witnesses which exceeded proper limits of fresh complaint testimony constituted ineffective assistance of counsel); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gillette, </em>33 Mass. App. Ct. 427, 429-431 (1992) (failure of trial counsel to object to highly damaging fresh complaint testimony that was not sufficiently fresh constituted ineffective assistance of counsel).</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">The cross-examination of the complainant by the defendant\u2019s trial counsel on her contact with Savelli was inept and introduced improper fresh complaint evidence, including details, that the Commonwealth had not offered. The cross-examination opened the door for the prosecutor to show in redirect examination (without proper objection) that the complainant had written a letter to Flemming in which she stated that \u201cevery time my mother [was] out of the house . . . [the defendant] rape[d] me.\u201d There should have been a motion to strike all of the complainant\u2019s fresh complaint testimony at the conclusion of the Commonwealth\u2019s case because most of it exceeded proper limits. The motion to strike should have been accompanied by a request for a strong instruction to the jury to disregard the testimony. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Scullin, supra </em>at 12-13. No such motion or request was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-6\">The failure by the defendant\u2019s trial counsel to object to the judge\u2019s instructions to the jury on the role of fresh complaint evidence also fell below what would be expected of reasonably competent counsel. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sugrue, supra </em>at 173-175; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gillette, supra </em>at 429-432. The instructions were flawed in several respects. They gave no definition of the meaning of corroboration. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Scanlon, </em>412 Mass. 664, 674 (1992) (\u201cAn instruction that [fresh complaint] evidence may be used only to corroborate the complaining witness\u2019s testimony, without a definition of the term corroboration, does not alleviate the risk that the jury would use such evidence substantively\u201d). The instructions erroneously told the jury that the complainant\u2019s testimony \u201cabout the details of what she told [a fresh complaint witness] are admissible.\u201d The instructions went on to seriously damage the defendant\u2019s case by conveying the erroneous impression that it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>did not matter whether Flemming had testified because the jury were free to treat her as though she had, in fact, corroborated the complainant\u2019s claim of fresh complaint.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The instructions in substance called the jury\u2019s attention to erroneously admitted evidence, and to matters not in evidence, creating the risk that the jury would give the matter undue weight.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Goss, </em>41 Mass. App. Ct. 929, 929-930 &amp; n.2 (1996) (judge\u2019s erroneous instruction as to fresh complaint evidence allowed jury to put undue weight on evidence and caused substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice). We can discern no reasonable trial strategy that would explain or justify any of these failures. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Scullin, supra </em>at 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">(ii) We are satisfied as a result of his trial counsel\u2019s action, that the defendant lost an available ground of defense. A considerable amount of inadmissible fresh complaint evidence was placed before the jury under flawed jury instructions. The defendant testified. The thrust of his defense was that the complainant hated him, and that she had fabricated the charges because of her dislike for him and to explain away problems she was having. The complainant was the principal witness for the Commonwealth, and several important parts of her testimony were uncorroborated.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Where the case hinged on the issue of credibility, the deficient representation provided by the defendant\u2019s trial counsel, and what flowed from it, cast doubt on the validity of the jury\u2019s verdicts. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Egardo, </em>426 Mass. 48, 53-54 (1997); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Scullin, supra </em>at 13-14; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gillette, supra </em>at 430-432.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">3.

You should consider all of those things, jurors, in deciding whether or not the complaint that was made by this witness to [the guidance counsellor] was reasonably fresh after the incident.

But once the alleged victim has testified directly to you about the sexual assault, then the fresh complaint testimony is admissible for your consideration if you decide that it was made reasonably fresh.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b47-7\">The fresh complaint doctrine is an exception to the usual rule that a prior statement of a witness concerning a material fact that is consistent with the witness\u2019s trial testimony may only be admitted on redirect examination in limited circumstances. Those circumstances are described in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bailey, </em>370 Mass. 388, 391-392 &amp; n.3 (1976).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b47-12\">The rale in the majority of jurisdictions is that, when the complainant has not been impeached, and when the complaint is not a spontaneous utterance, only the fact of the complaint is admissible in the prosecution\u2019s case-in-chief. Many jurisdictions, however, permit admission of evidence of the details of the complaint in certain other circumstances. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Licata, </em>412 Mass. 654, 659 n.8 (1992) (describing those circumstances).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b50-7\">The Commonwealth also points to a statement in J.R. Nolan &amp; B.R. Henry, Criminal Law \u00a7 236, at 174 (2d ed. 1988), that, \u201c[b]oth the victim and the person to whom she made the complaint may testify as to the complaint, including all the details of the attack as related by the victim,\u201d as meaning that each alone may so testify. However, this treatise cites <em>Glover </em>v. <em>Callahan, </em>299 Mass. 55, 58 (1937), in support of this statement, in which the victim\u2019s testimony was corroborated by testimony of the victim\u2019s mother and a police officer. In that case, we stated that fresh complaint evidence is admissible \u201c \u2018for the more general purpose of confirming the testimony\u2019 of the victim. \u2018The test is whether . . . her having made the complaint tends to corroborate testimony given\u2019 by her at the trial. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cleary, </em>172 Mass. 175, 176, 177 [1898].\u201d <em>Glover </em>v. <em>Callahan, supra </em>at 57. The case, and thus the statement in the treatise, in no way suggests that a victim may bootstrap her testimony solely with her own account of statements made to others.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b50-8\">It appears that only two States still adhere to the rule that permits testimony regarding the details of a sexual assault complaint, even if such testimony is not otherwise admissible either as a prior consistent statement introduced to rebut a claim of recent fabrication or under the spontaneous utterance exception. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Blohm, </em>281 N.W.2d 651 (Minn. 1979); <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>State, </em>17 Ohio 593 (1848). The vast majority of States limit fresh complaint evidence to testimony concerning the fact of the complaint; the details of the complaint are not admissible. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Troupe, </em>237 Conn. 284, 299 n.14 (1996) (collecting cases on majority view).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b51-8\">We do not mention here the complainant\u2019s testimony about her complaints to Savelli because the defendant\u2019s trial counsel brought out the testimony in his cross-examination of the complainant. For reasons that we shall explain shortly, the handling of the testimony regarding Savelli adds further support to the conclusion that the defendant did not receive effective assistance from his trial counsel.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b51-9\">The Commonwealth makes no response to this claim in its brief. It argues only that the fresh complaint evidence was properly admitted.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b51-10\">Although we analyze the error under the ineffective assistance of counsel standard, the defendant also argues that what occurred created a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice. These, two doctrines, in a case like this, are virtually coextensive, and either could be used to support an order for a new trial. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Amirault, </em>424 Mass. 618, 652 n.24 (1997).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b53-7\">This misimpression occurred when the judge told the jury in her final charge, \u201cIf [the complainant] didn\u2019t testify directly to you, we could never allow the guidance counselor to come in and say, \u2018I got his report from the alleged victim.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b53-8\">We note that this instruction followed the prosecutor\u2019s remarks in his summation concerning Flemming\u2019s contact with the complainant, where the prosecutor reminded the jury that, when the complainant eventually decided to complain, she turned to \u201ca trusted person ... a counselor that she had . . . seen a number of times.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b53-9\">The risk is not speculative. The jury asked during deliberations whether \u201cthe statements from DSS or the school counselor [were] available for review?\u201d The judge answered, \u201cNo.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b53-10\">The complainant\u2019s mother was the only other Commonwealth witness. She supported her daughter\u2019s testimony in peripheral respects only.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
