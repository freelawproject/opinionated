The defendant Samuel Rios, while operating a car owned by the defendant Benjamin Rios, drove into the rear of the plaintiff\u2019s automobile, pinning the plaintiff\u2019s legs between the two vehicles.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-8\">After bringing an action for damages alleging the defendants\u2019 negligence, the plaintiff moved for an interlocutory summary judgment on the issue of liability.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The defendants did not raise by pleading or opposing affidavit the plaintiff\u2019s failure to meet the statutory criteria or so-called thresholds required for the maintenance of automobile negligence actions by the provisions of \u00a7 38-323 of the General Statutes.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The court granted the motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-9\">Thereafter, the matter of damages was tried to a jury. The evidence focused on the factual issue of the applicability of the $503.51 in medical bills to the injuries sustained in the accident and the question of whether the plaintiff was permanently injured.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>The court instructed the jury on the various no-fault criteria or thresholds and thereafter provided the jury with two verdict forms and explained that one was for use in returning a plaintiff\u2019s verdict and the other for use in returning a defendants\u2019 verdict. The plaintiff took timely exception to the submission of the two forms to the jury. After the jury returned a verdict for the defendants, the plaintiff moved to set aside the verdict and to open the judgment. The motion was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-6\">The plaintiff has appealed from the court\u2019s denial of his motion. He contends that the court erred in submitting both a plaintiff\u2019s and a defendants\u2019 verdict form to the jury. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-7\">The rendition of the summary judgment establishes \u201cthe fact that a technical legal injury ha[s] been done ... to the plaintiff, and this entitle[s] the plaintiff to at least nominal damages.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Keller </em>v. <em>Carone, </em>138 Conn. 405, 406-407, 85 A.2d 489 (1951). The jury here, however, failed to award even nominal damages and returned instead, a defendants\u2019 verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-8\">As a general rule, this court will not reverse and grant a new trial for the mere failure to award nominal damages. <em>Sessa </em>v. <em>Gigliotti, </em>165 Conn. 620, 622, 345 A.2d 45 (1973); <em>Waicunas </em>v. <em>Macari, </em>151 Conn. 134, 139, 193 A.2d 709 (1963); <em>Keller </em>v. <em>Carone, </em>supra, 407; <em>Went </em>v. <em>Schmidt, </em>117 Conn. 257, 259-60, 167 A. 721 (1933); <em>Beattie </em>v. <em>New York, N.H. &amp; H. R. Co., </em>84 Conn. 555, 559, 80 A. 709 (1911). This case warrants an exception to the general rule, however, for at this juncture, it cannot be ascertained whether the defendants\u2019 verdict represented a rejection of the plaintiff\u2019s claims concerning damages, or a finding that the no-fault <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>thresholds were not crossed, the latter being a factual issue which should not have been submitted to the jury once it was resolved by summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-6\">By charging the jury on the no-fault thresholds and thereafter submitting the two verdict forms to them, the court in essence reopened the liability issue and submitted it to the jury. \u201cThe issue of liability [however] had been previously decided by the court when it granted the plaintiff\u2019s motion for summary judgment, and, therefore, the jury had before them only [the matter of] damages.\u201d <em>Riccio </em>v. <em>Abate, </em>176 Conn. 415, 418, 407 A.2d 1005 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b769-7\">There is error, the judgment is set aside and the case is remanded for a further hearing in damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b767-10\"> Practice Book \u00a7 385 provides in relevant part: <em>\u201cA </em>summary judgment, interlocutory in character, may be rendered on the issue of liability alone, although there is a genuine issue as to damages. . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b767-12\"> General Statutes \u00a7 38-323 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cNo cause of action to recover economic loss . . . based on negligence arising out of the ownership ... or use of a private passenger motor vehicle may be maintained . . . unless the injured party has sustained . . . (2)permanent injury ... or (7) allowable expense ... in excess of four hundred dollars . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
