J.</author>\n<p id=\"AQp\">This appeal concerns a contested Democratic party primary election in the city of West Haven and comes before this court pursuant to the expedited review procedure provided by \u00a7 9-325 of the General Statutes. Because of the expeditious nature of the proceedings, on October 16, 1981, this court announced from the bench its decision<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> that a new primary be conducted at a time to be determined by a judge of the Superior Court, with further opinion to be filed in due course.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-9\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b138-10\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b138-11\">On September 8, 1981, a Democratic party primary election was held in the city of West Haven. The plaintiff, Donald J. Wrinn, and the named <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>defendant, George Dunleavy, were the candidates for the party\u2019s nomination for the office of mayor. In the official count of the votes on September 8, and in a recanvass on September 13, both certified by the head moderator, the named defendant prevailed over the plaintiff by eight votes: 2847 to 2839.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">On September 11, 1981, the plaintiff initiated the present action pursuant to \u00a7 9-329a of the General Statutes.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Section 9-329a provides, in relevant part, that any candidate \u201caggrieved by a ruling of an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>election official in connection with any primary . . . or who alleges that there has been a mistake in the count of the votes cast at snch primary, may bring his complaint to any judge of the superior court for appropriate action.\u201d The plaintiff\u2019s amended complaint, which named as defendants Greorge Dunleavy and various election officials,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> also contained two additional counts not based on \u00a7 9-329a, but because of the way this case has been appealed, the trial judge\u2019s treatment of those counts is not now before this court.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">On September 11, 1981, pursuant to \u00a7 9-329a, the defendants were ordered by Judge Hadden to appear for a hearing on September 16, 1981. The hearing was conducted by Judge Norcott. At issue was the propriety of the handling of certain absentee ballots. On September 18, 1981, the parties agreed to a stipulation of the facts regarding these absentee ballots. This stipulation, as reported by the trial judge in his memorandum of decision, was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>\u201c(1) Florence Corradino, a resident of 200 Oak Street, known as \u2018Surfside 200,\u2019 an elderly high-rise within the Second Voting District in West Haven, mailed 26 absentee ballots from physically disabled or ill electors residing at that complex.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-5\">\u201c(2) Florence Corradino, upon receipt of the 26 ballots, mailed them by placing them in a mailbox located immediately outside the outer door of Surf-side 200.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-6\">\u201c(3) Of the 26 absentee ballots mailed, cast and counted all were votes for the defendant George Dunleavy. [See footnote 5, infra.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-7\">\u201c(4) At the time of the mailing Mrs. Corradino was not an election official, a physician, nurse, person earing for the health of the persons whose ballots she mailed, nor was she any of the specially designated persons defined in Connecticut General Statutes, \u00a7 9-146 (b).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-8\">\u201c(5) Florence Corradino held no official capacity in the primary election.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b141-9\">Under this stipulation, the principal question below was whether the twenty-six absentee ballots were properly mailed and, thus, were properly counted. The trial judge found that \u201c[b]ut for the counting of the aforementioned 26 absentee ballots . . . the plaintiff would have won the primary election.\u201d Section 9-146 (b) of the General Statutes expressly deals with the situation where an elector <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>does not personally mail his or her absentee ballot. This section provides: \u201cIn the case of an elector who cast an absentee ballot because of illness or physical disability, such ballot shall only be mailed by such elector or by any person designated by such elector who consents thereto. Such elector may designate for such purpose only one of the following persons: A licensed physician, registered or practical nurse or any other person who is caring for such elector because of such elector\u2019s illness or physical disability, a member of such elector\u2019s family or, if no such person consents or is available, then a police officer, registrar of voters or deputy registrar of voters in the municipality in which such elector resides.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">On September 25, 1981, the trial judge rendered judgment for the defendants. The trial judge held that although there had been deficiencies in complying with \u00a7 9-146 by the twenty-six absentee voters, there had been \u201csubstantial compliance\u201d with the requirements for the casting of the absentee ballots. As a result, the trial judge denied the plaintiff\u2019s prayers for relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">On September 30, 1981, the plaintiff, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 9-325,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> applied to the trial judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>for the certification of a question of law for expedited review by this court. The judge certified the plaintiff\u2019s question of law on September 30, together with his findings and order, and transmitted the same to the Chief Justice as required by the statute. On October 1, 1981, the judge certified three questions of law raised by the defendants. An expedited briefing schedule was established by this court and oral argument was held on October 16, 1981.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">On October 5, 1981, the plaintiff filed a separate, direct appeal from the judgment rendered against him, raising certain issues not contained within the certified questions of law.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> No cross-appeal was filed by the defendants. The plaintiff\u2019s direct appeal has not been heard by this court.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In view of this court\u2019s decision for the plaintiff on the merits as raised by expedited review under \u00a7 9-325, the separate appeal of the plaintiff is hereby dismissed as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>n</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">Nature or Review</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">The first matter which this court must consider is the nature of our review under \u00a7 9-325. Section 9-329a expressly provides that any decision thereunder may be \u201cappealed from as provided in section 9-325.\u201d Section 9-325, entitled \u201cAppeals and reservations of law to be taken to supreme court,\u201d provides, in relevant part, that if, after the required hearing, \u201cany question of law is raised which any party to the complaint claims should be reviewed by the supreme court,\u201d the Superior Court judge \u201cshall transmit [his finding or decision], including therein such questions of law, together with a proper finding of facts, to the chief justice of the supreme court. . . .\u201d The Chief Justice \u201cshall thereupon call a special session of said court for the purpose of an immediate hearing upon the questions of law so certified.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b144-7\">This court has dealt with such a review <em>{% </em>9-325) on only one previous occasion. See <em>In re Henry T. Blake, </em>77 Conn. 595, 60 A. 292 (1905). In <em>Blake </em>the complainant, claiming aggrievement by a moderator\u2019s rejection of his ballot, sought review of certain questions of law related to his complaint under an early version of \u00a7 9-325. This court dismissed the case on jurisdictional grounds because the certified questions of law had not been decided below and there was, consequently, nothing for the Supreme Court to \u201creview.\u201d Id., 598. <em>Blake </em>clearly established that the certified questions of law are not \u201creserved\u201d for Supreme Court consideration but rather come before the court only for review of the decision reached by the trial judge. See Maltbie, Conn. App. Proc. \u00a7\u00a7 231-34, 236.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>The review procedure provided by \u00a7 9-325 differs significantly from the standard appeal under \u00a7 52-263 of the General Statutes and \u00a7\u00a7 3000 et seq. of the Practice Book. This is because of the expedited nature of the procedure challenging election and primary results. Section 9-329a, for example, requires the original complaint to be brought within <em>three days </em>of the primary challenged, the hearing required by the statute is to be conducted within <em>three to five days </em>after it is ordered, and the trial judge is to render a decision \u201cwithout delay.\u201d The legislature enacted \u00a7 9-325 so that this court would expeditiously decide what \u00a7 9-329a itself describes as an \u201cappeal\u201d of the trial judge\u2019s expedited decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">The expedited review provided by \u00a7 9-325, irrespective of its unusual procedural features, is in substance an appeal, as in fact it is described in the statutes to which it is applicable. See General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 9-324, 9-328, 9-329a. The questions of law raised by a party under \u00a7 9-325 parallel the statement of issues which a party raises on appeal. See Practice Book \u00a7 3012. The certification of these questions, together with the judge\u2019s decision thereon, operates to invoke the appellate jurisdiction of this court, much as an appeal from a final judgment.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> See Practice Book \u00a7 3000. Of course, even in a standard appeal, this court reviews only properly preserved questions of law. See General Statutes \u00a7 52-263; Practice Book \u00a7 3000. The appellate authority of this court is the same in a review <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>under \u00a7 9-325 as in an appeal under \u00a7 52-263; however, the expedited review proceeding under $ 9-325 may deal only with questions of law arising under the statutory provisions by which the ^ 9-325 review may be invoked.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">The conclusion that the expedited review proceeding of \u00a7 9-325 is, in effect, an expedited appeal may seem to be inconsistent with the last two sentences of \u00a7 9-325 which state: \u201cNothing in this section shall be considered as prohibiting an appeal to the supreme court from a final judgment of the superior court. The judges of the supreme court may establish rules of procedure for the speedy and inexpensive hearing of such appeals within fifteen days ____\u201d It is clear, however, that the last two sentences of \u00a7 9-325, which were added to the statute in 1978 by Public Acts 1978, No. 78-125, $ 10, are not intended to indicate that the review proceeding is not an appeal but rather are intended to indicate that the expedited review procedure provided by \u00a7 9-325 is not the exclusive method of seeking review of the decision of a trial judge in an election case.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>Thus, in a case such, as the present one, where a final judgment has been rendered below, the aggrieved parties would be able to use both methods, as the plaintiff has in fact done. The two appeals would normally be consolidated or, as with the present case, one of the appeals would be moot once the other is heard by this court. The method to be used by a party with access to both would generally depend on the questions that the party wanted to present to this court. As previously noted, the questions of law are limited under the expedited review procedure of \u00a7 9-325; however, the issues on an appeal are not so limited and may include any issues arising from the final judgment, including issues outside the election statutes, such as, for example, the availability of a declaratory judgment as a remedy in election disputes.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">In view of the foregoing, this court now turns to the certified questions of law raised by the parties to determine whether the trial judge erred in answering those questions as he did.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b147-7\">The Defendants' Questions</p>\n<p id=\"b147-8\">Before this court may reach the merits of the present appeal as raised by the plaintiff\u2019s certified question of law, we must first consider the three certified questions of law raised by the defendants. These threshold questions arise from three motions to dismiss made during the proceedings below which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>were decided against the defendants. An affirmative answer to any of these questions would make it unnecessary for this court to reach the plaintiff\u2019s question.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">The first of the defendants\u2019 questions certified by the trial judge is:</p>\n<p id=\"b148-7\">\u201cIn a statutory proceeding under 9-329a of the General Statutes, must the judge issuing the order for the hearing personally conduct it? If so, does the conduct [sic] of the hearing by another judge warrant the dismissal of the proceedings?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b148-8\">This question arises because one judge, Judge Hadden, ordered the hearing on the plaintiff\u2019s complaint under \u00a7 9-329a and another judge, Judge Norcott, conducted the hearing. The statutory language in question states that a complaint such as the plaintiff\u2019s is to be brought directly \u201cto any judge of the superior court,\u201d that \u201c[s]uch judge\u201d shall order a hearing, and that \u201c[s]uch judge\u201d shall conduct the hearing. The defendants contend that the failure to adhere to the statutory scheme requires the dismissal of the case on jurisdictional grounds.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> We conclude that there was compliance with the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-9\">The particular language of ^ 9-329a in question was adopted only recently, in 1978 by Public Acts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>1978, No. 78-125, \u00a7 12. Prior to the 1978 amendment, the statute, then \u00a7 9-449 of the General Statutes, provided that the complaint be brought to \u201cany judge of the superior court,\u201d that \u201csuch judge\u201d shall order the hearing and that \u201c[s]uch judge or, <em>in case of his inability, a judge designated by the chief justice of the supreme court\u201d </em>shall conduct the hearing. (Emphasis added.) Thus, prior to the 1978 amendment, the defendants\u2019 contention would have had merit. The earlier version of the statute intended that the judge who issued the order for the hearing would also conduct it, as indicated by the specified mechanism for replacing that judge. In 1978, however, the legislature amended the language in question and deleted the express replacement mechanism.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">Because the present statute only mentions \u201csuch judge,\u201d it must be read to refer to \u201cany judge of the superior court\u201d and not to the specific judge to whom the complaint was originally brought. Furthermore, \u00a7 51-189 provides that when \u201cany application, petition or matter\u201d is presented to or pending before any judge of the Superior Court, that judge may designate any other Superior Court judge to hear the case or transfer the case to such judge. When this is done the other judge is to proceed \u201cwith the same authority as though the same had originally been presented to him or had theretofore been pending before him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">Therefore, as to the defendants\u2019 first certified question of law, there was no error in one judge\u2019s issuing the order for the required hearing and another judge\u2019s conducting it.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>B</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">The second of the defendants\u2019 certified questions of law is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-6\">\u201cIn a statutory proceeding under ^ 9-329a, must the alleged misconduct relied on be by an \u2018election official.\u2019 If so, is the alleged misconduct by a person other than an \u2018election official\u2019 within the purvue [sic] of the statute?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b150-7\">The defendants contend that with regard to a primary election dispute \u00a7 9-329a is limited to disputes concerning the propriety of the actions of election officials and the arithmetic tabulation of the votes. Thus, according to the defendants, because the present dispute does not concern either the activity of an election official or the tabulation of the votes, the plaintiff\u2019s complaint should have been dismissed. The trial judge rejected this reasoning and held that the plaintiff\u2019s complaint was properly brought under \u00a7 9-329a.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-8\">Section 9-329a provides that a candidate such as the plaintiff may bring a complaint thereunder if the candidate either is \u201caggrieved by a ruling of an election official in connection with any primary\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> or \u201calleges that there has been a mistake in the count of the votes cast at such primary.\u201d The plaintiff\u2019s complaint is based on the casting of twenty-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>six absentee ballots which, according to the plaintiff, were void because they were improperly mailed. Thus, because the plaintiff would have won the primary had these ballots not been counted, he clearly is aggrieved by the ruling of an election official, such \u201cruling\u201d being the counting of the absentee ballots.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">Therefore, as to the defendants\u2019 second certified question of law, we hold that the plaintiff\u2019s complaint was properly brought under \u00a7 9-329a.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b151-7\">The third of the defendants\u2019 certified questions of law is:</p>\n<p id=\"b151-8\">\u201cIn a statutory proceeding under \u00a7 9-329a of the General Statutes, must notice of the proceeding and hearing be given to the under-ticket in a mayoral primary election as \u2018candidates in any way directly affected by the decision upon such hearing?\u2019 If so, does the failure to serve or notice the under-ticket in the instant action warrant dismissal of the proceeding?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b151-9\">This question arises because the primary in dispute involved not only the nomination for mayor but also nominations for seats on the board of education, the board of tax review, and the town council. Notice of the hearing conducted by the trial judge was not provided to any of the candidates for those nominations. It is the defendants\u2019 contention that the plaintiff\u2019s action must be dismissed because of this want of notice.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>Section 9-S29a provides that for any proceeding held thereunder the Superior Court judge who orders the hearing \u201cshall cause notice of not less than three days to be given to any candidate or candidates in any way <em>directly affected by the decision </em>upon such hearing, to such election official [from whose ruling the plaintiff claims aggrievement] and to any other person or persons, whom such judge deems proper parties thereto, of the time and place of the hearing . . . (Emphasis added.) The statute does not require that all candidates in the contested primary be noticed, as it easily could have done. Notice is required to be given only to those candidates \u201cdirectly affected by the decision.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">In the present case the dispute is restricted to the validity of twenty-six specific absentee ballots. The certified results of the West Haven Democratic party primary reveal that all races in the primary, with the exception of that for the nomination for mayor, were decided by more than twenty-six votes. Because of this the trial judge found that there was \u201cno evidence that the 26 absentee ballots in question directly affected any candidate other than those party to this instant action.\u201d In view of this finding, not disputed by any of the parties, this court must conclude that there was no error in the notice given of the complaint brought pursuant to \u00a7 9-329a. Cf. <em>Lobsenz </em>v. <em>Davidoff, </em>182 Conn. 111, 116, 438 A.2d 21 (1980). The defendants\u2019 contention that the other candidates would be affected by a new primary is without merit because the new primary ordered by this court is to be held only between the named ^parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>Therefore, as to the defendants\u2019 third certified question of law, we conclude that the notice of the proceeding complied with $ 9-329a.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">The Plaintiee\u2019s Question</p>\n<p id=\"b153-7\">The plaintiff\u2019s question of law, as certified by the trial judge, is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-8\">\u201cDid the judge err in concluding that elderly electors, casting absentee ballots because of illness or physical disability, substantially complied with mandatory mailing requirements of section 9-146 (b) of the Connecticut G-eneral Statutes, when their ballots were mailed by a person other than persons specifically designated by such statute?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b153-9\">The plaintiff contends that there has not been substantial compliance with the mailing requirements of \u00a7 9-146 (b), supra, and that, therefore, the ballots in question must be invalidated. The defendants, on the other hand, maintain that, in the absence of any showing of fraud, there was substantial compliance. In the alternative, the defendants maintain that the question of substantial compliance need not be reached because the mailing provisions of the statute should be viewed as directory rather than mandatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-10\">This court acknowledges and concurs in the reluctance with which courts invalidate ballots, because such action effectively disfranchises the voters involved. \u201c \u2018 \u201cWhere the legislature in express terms says that a ballot shall be void for some cause, the courts must undoubtedly hold it to be void; but no voter is to be disfranchised on a doubtful construction, and statutes tending to limit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>the exercise of the ballot should be liberally construed in his favor. Unless a ballot comes clearly within the prohibition of some statute it should be counted, if from it the wish or will of the voter can be ascertained.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Dombkowski </em>v. <em>Messier, </em>164 Conn. 204, 207, 319 A.2d 373 (1972); <em>Hurlbut </em>v. <em>Lemelin, </em>155 Conn. 68, 77, 230 A.2d 36 (1967); <em>Scully </em>v. <em>Westport, </em>145 Conn. 648, 651-52, 145 A.2d 742 (1958); <em>State </em>v. <em>Bossa, </em>69 Conn. 335, 341, 37 A. 977 (1897). But the right to vote is not absolute and is subject to regulation by the legislature. <em>Mills </em>v. <em>Gaynor, </em>136 Conn. 632, 636, 73 A.2d 823 (1950). See generally General Statutes, Title 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">In this case we are concerned with absentee voting\u2014a special type of voting procedure established by the legislature for those otherwise qualified voters who for one or more of the authorized reasons are unable to cast their ballots at the regular polling place. See General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 9-135, 9-133a.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> We have previously recognized \u201cthat <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>there is considerable room for fraud in absentee voting and that a failure to comply with the regulatory provisions governing absentee voting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>increases the opportunity for fraud.\u201d <em>Dombkowski </em>v. <em>Messier, </em>supra, 209. In <em>Flanagan </em>v. <em>Hynes, </em>75 Conn. 584, 588, 54 A. 737 (1903), we stated \u201c[i]f there is to he disfranchisement, it should be because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>the legislature has seen fit to require it in the interest of an honest suffrage, and has expressed that requirement in unmistakable language.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">In view of the express language of the absentee voting chapter and this court\u2019s decision in <em>Dombkowski </em>v. <em>Messier, </em>supra, there is no question that the provisions of \u00a7 9-146<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> and specifically the mailing requirements of \u00a7 9-146 (b) are mandatory. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>statutory provisions authorizing absentee voting at elections and primaries both state that such voting shall take place \u201cin the manner and subject to the conditions hereinafter stated.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 9-135, 9-133a, supra. By its own terms \u00a7 9-146(a), in relevant part, unequivocally states: \u201cAn absentee ballot <em>shall he cast </em>at any election <em>only if\u201d </em>the mailing requirements are fulfilled. (Emphasis added.) Section 9-146 (b) provides that the ballot of an ill or disabled elector \u201cshall only be mailed\u201d by the elector or by a designated person who may be \u201conly one\u201d of the persons on a specified list.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">Had the legislature intended that such clearly mandatory language not require the invalidation of a ballot not conforming to the statutory requirements, it could have so specified as it has in other sections of the absentee voting chapter. In \u00a7 9-138, for example, which requires that the elector or an authorized agent sign and date the statement on the ballot\u2019s inner envelope, the legislature specifically provided that \u201c[t]he failure of such applicant or such authorized agent to date such form shall not invalidate the ballot.\u201d An example of another type of saving provision employed by the legislature is found in \u00a7 9-145 which states: \u201cNo absentee ballot shall be rejected as a marked ballot unless such ballot, in the opinion of the moderator, was marked in such way for the purpose of providing a means for its identification.\u201d The absence of any type of saving provision in connection with the mailing requirements of \u00a7 9-146 (b) leads to the conclusion that these requirements are mandatory and that noncompliance with them requires the invalidation of such a ballot.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>This court has previously held that the provisions of the absentee voting statute are mandatory. <em>Dombkowski </em>v. <em>Messier, </em>supra. In <em>Dombkowski, </em>we specifically concluded that the provisions of \u00a7 9-148 of the General Statutes, dealing with the handling of absentee ballots by the municipal clerk, were mandatory hy reference to the mandatory language contained in an earlier version of \u00a7 9-146.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Though the specific language of \u00a7 9-146 has been modified since <em>Dombkowski, </em>the mandatory nature of the statute, as discussed above, remains unchanged. There is, therefore, no reason for us to disturb the holding of <em>Dombkowski.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">Having concluded that the mailing requirements of \u00a7 9-146 (b) are mandatory, we next consider whether there has been compliance with these provisions. In <em>Dombkowski </em>v. <em>Messier, </em>supra, 209, this court stated that \u201cwhere the legislature has provided mandatory requirements specifically designed to prevent fraud, at least a substantial compliance with such statutes is necessary.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">Because the ballots in question were not mailed personally by the absentee voters, in accordance with \u00a7 9-146 (b) the ballots should have been mailed by one of the following persons: \u201cA licensed phy<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>sician, registered or practical nurse or any other person who is caring for such elector because of such elector\u2019s illness or physical disability, a member of such elector\u2019s family or, if no such person consents or is available, then a police officer, registrar of voters or deputy registrar of voters in the municipality in which such elector resides.\u201d In \u00a7 9-146 (b), the legislature has provided a detailed list of those categories of persons who could be designated to mail an absentee ballot. Had the legislature intended that <em>any </em>authorized agent could mail an absentee ballot, it could have so said, as it did, for example, in \u00a7 9-138 regarding an agent\u2019s signing of the statement on the inner envelope of the ballot. By specifying particular categories of persons,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> the legislature has mandated that ballots mailed under \u00a7 9-146 (b) shall be counted only if mailed by persons who come within one of the specified categories. It is clear from the stipulation that the person who mailed the ballots in question was not one of the persons specified by the legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">The trial judge, however, after noting that the underlying intent of the absentee ballot law was to prevent fraud, concluded that \u201cin the absence of a showing of fraud or connivance, the actions of <em>these </em>electors and Mrs. Corradino evidence substantial compliance with the mandatory requirements of \u00a7 9-146 (b) .\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>The trial judge\u2019s reliance upon an absence of a showing of any fraud is misplaced. Whether fraud has been committed in the handling of certain absentee ballots is irrelevant to the question of whether there has been substantial compliance with all of the mandatory provisions of the absentee voting law. <em>Dombkowski </em>v. <em>Messier, </em>supra, 207. Had the legislature chosen to do so, it could have enacted a remedial scheme under which ballots would only be invalidated upon a showing of fraud or other related irregularity. The legislature has instead enacted a regulatory scheme designed to prevent fraud as far as practicable by mandating the way in which absentee ballots are to be handled. The validity of the ballot, therefore, depends not on whether there has been fraud, but on whether there has been substantial compliance with the mandatory requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">Because the twenty-six absentee voters in this case did <em>not substantially comply </em>with the mandatory provisions of \u00a7 9-146 (b) their votes may not be counted. While this may seem a harsh result when, as in this ease, the intent of these voters is clear, it must be remembered that these voters have disfranchised themselves by not complying with \u00a7 9-146 (b), about which they had been warned in the materials accompanying the ballot.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> This case, therefore, differs from <em>Dombkowski </em>v. <em>Messier, </em>supra, in this respect because the voters in <em>Dombkowski </em>were disfranchised, not by their own actions, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>but by the noneomplianee of the municipal clerk with the requirements of \u00a7 9-148. Thus, the trial judge erred in holding that there had been substantial compliance with the requirements of \u00a7 9-146 (b), because, in fact, there had been no compliance at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">Therefore, the answer to the plaintiff\u2019s certified question of law is that the trial judge did err in finding \u201csubstantial compliance\u201d with the mandatory requirements of \u00a7 9-146 (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b162-7\">Remedy</p>\n<p id=\"b162-8\">The plaintiff has requested that he be declared the winner of the Democratic party primary on the ground that after the invalidation of the twenty-six absentee ballots in question and the resulting correction of the returns, his vote total would exceed that of the named defendant by sixteen votes. If this case concerned an election rather than a primary, then this remedy woxdd be available by correction of the returns. \u00a7\u00a7 9-323, 9-324, 9-328; see <em>Dombkowski </em>v. <em>Messier, </em>supra, 207-209. There is, however, some question as to the remedy that we should order in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-9\">The question of what remedy this court should consider arises because the statute applicable to the challenge of a <em>primary, % </em>9-329a, provides remedies different from and fewer than do the statutes applicable to the challenge of an <em>election. </em>Sections 9-323, 9-324 and 9-328 all provide that a judge hearing an election challenge thereunder may: (1) order a recount of the votes, including absentee ballots, (2) order a new election, or (3) render a decision regarding the rulings of the election official or the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>count of votes, such decision operating \u201cto correct the returns.\u201d On the other hand, the primary challenge statute, \u00a7 9-329a, in its listing of remedies provides, in relevant part, that the judge may \u201c(a) order any voting machine used at such primary to he opened and a recount made of the votes cast; (b) order a new primary held at such time as he may fix if he finds that but for the improper actions of the election official the result of such primary might have been different and that by utilizing the procedure set out in subsection (c) he would be unable to determine the result of such primary or; (e) determine the result of such primary if he finds that the improper actions of the election official prevented persons entitled to vote from voting at such primary and after allowing such persons to vote by sealed paper ballot, he finds the result of such primary will be different.\u201d Section 9-329a does not specifically provide either for the recounting of absentee ballots or for the subtraction of invalid votes, both specifically allowed under \u00a7\u00a7 9-323, 9-324 and 9-328.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">It would appear that the difference in the remedies provided for challenges to elections and those provided for primaries represents a different legislative policy as to the way in which such challenges are to be resolved. The limitation on the remedies applicable to a primary challenge suggests that the legislature intended certain disputes about primaries to be resolved with a new primary even when, as in this case, a winner could be determined under the remedies specifically applicable in election challenges. These legislative expressions should be given great weight, especially when they are based on considerations which are not properly within the judicial sphere. In this case we have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>decided to employ one of the statute\u2019s remedies because of the legislature\u2019s apparent intent that such remedy be used in a ease such as this.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">Because of the apparent policy of the legislature that primary disputes such as the present one involving absentee ballots are to be resolved by a new primary, we have decided to order such a primary in this case. Whether this policy is appropriate, given the added expenses it generates and the delays in the election schedules it may cause, is a question we leave to the legislature. As the present statutes are written, the difference between the primary challenge statute, \u00a7 9-329a, and the statutes regarding challenges of elections, \u00a7\u00a7 9-323, 9-324, 9-328, can be given no other meaningful construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b164-7\">There is error, the judgment is set aside and the case is remanded with direction to render judgment for the plaintiff ordering a new primary to be held forthwith, at a time to be fixed by a judge of the Superior Court, between the plaintiff and the named defendant for the Democratic party nomination for mayor of the city of West Haven.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b164-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b138-12\"> The decision announced from the bench was: \u201cThere is error, the judgment is set aside and the ease is remanded with direction to render judgment for the plaintiff, ordering a new primary to be held forthwith, at a time to be fixed by a judge of the Superior Court, between the plaintiff and the named defendant for the Democratic nomination for mayor of the city of West Haven.
