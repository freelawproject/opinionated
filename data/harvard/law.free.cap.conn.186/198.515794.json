Healey, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ALF\">On March 25, 1977, the plaintiff, Charles Farricielli, was dismissed from his position as an institutional security officer at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>Southern Connecticut State College for failure to obtain and retain Connecticut State Police powers as required by job specifications. The plaintiff appealed this dismissal to the Connecticut personnel appeal board (the board) on March 31, 1977, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 5-202 (a). The board dismissed the plaintiff\u2019s appeal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction on May 25, 1977.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">On June 23,1977, the plaintiff appealed from the decision of the board, under General Statutes \u00a7 4-183 (b),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to the Court of Common Pleas in Hartford County. Service was duly made upon the defendant by serving the office of the attorney general in Hartford. The plaintiff resided in New Haven County at the time he took the appeal to the Court of Common Pleas. The defendant moved to dismiss the plaintiff\u2019s appeal on the ground that the appeal was not filed in the Court of Common Pleas for the county in which the plaintiff resided as \u00a7 4-183 (b) then required. The court, <em>Fracasse, J., </em>granted the motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction upon finding that the venue provisions of \u00a7 4-183 (b) were mandatory and jurisdictional and that strict compliance was required. The plaintiff, after certification was granted, appealed to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">The main issue in this case is whether, on June 24, 1977, the venue provisions of General Statutes \u00a74-183 (b) were mandatory and jurisdictional, thereby rendering lack of strict compliance a fatal defect.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>In 1977, a person who had exhausted all administrative remedies and was aggrieved by a final decision of an administrative agency could then seek judicial review under General Statutes \u00a7 4-183 (b), <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> which is part of the Uniform Administrative Procedure Act (UAPA), which provided that \u201c[proceedings for review shall be instituted by filing a petition in the court of common pleas in the county wherein the aggrieved person resides . . . .\u201d The plaintiff, however, instead of filing his appeal in the Court of Common Pleas in New Haven County, the county where he resided, filed his appeal in the Court of Common Pleas for Hartford County, the county where the defendant board is located. The plaintiff now claims that the lower court erred in dismissing his appeal because the venue provisions of \u00a7 4-183 (b) are merely directory and not mandatory and failure strictly to comply with these provisions does not rise to the level of a jurisdictional defect. He also claims that it would not be fair to allow the lower court to dismiss his appeal for improper venue in light of the fact that the legislature amended \u00a7 4-183 (b) in 1977<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> to allow administrative appeals \u201cto the superior court for Hartford County <em>or </em>for the county or judicial district wherein the aggrieved person resides . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">We have stated that \u201c \u2018Mppeals to courts from administrative agencies exist only under statutory authority. <em>Tazza </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>164 Conn. 187, 190, 319 A.2d 393 [1972]; <em>East Side Civic Assn. </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>161 Conn. 558, 560, 290 A.2d 348 [1971]. A statutory right to appeal may be taken advantage of only by strict compliance with the statutory provisions by which it is created. <em>In re Nunes, </em>165 Conn. 435, 441, 334 A.2d 898 [1973]; <em>Chanosky </em>v. <em>City Building Supply Co., </em>152 Conn. 449, 451, 208 A.2d 337 [1965]; 4 Am. Jur. 2d, Appeal and Error, \u00a7 4.\u2019 \u201d <em>Royce </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>177 Conn. 584, 587, 418 A.2d 939 (1979). See also <em>Vecchio </em>v. <em>Sewer Authority, </em>176 Conn. 497, 502, 408 A.2d 254 (1979). In <em>Royce, </em>supra, we held that the time provisions of \u00a7 4-183 (b) were mandatory and that lack of strict compliance would be fatal to an appeal. We can find no justification for treating the venue provisions of the same statute any differently. We have said that not only does the UAPA provide for uniform standards by which certain agency action is to be judged but that it provides a vehicle for judicial review as an alternative to preexisting statutes or in situations in which no appellate review was previously provided. <em>McDermott </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Children &amp; Youth Services, </em>168 Conn. 435, 440-41, 363 A.2d 103 (1975). This is the first time we have construed the venue provisions of the UAPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\"><em>K </em>\u2018Appellate jurisdiction is derived from the constitutional or statutory provisions by which it is created, and can be acquired and exercised only in the manner prescribed. Thus, the determination of the existence and extent of appellate jurisdiction depends upon the terms of the statutory or constitutional provisions in which it has its source.\u2019 4 Am. Jur. 2d 535, Appeal and Error, \u00a74.\u201d <em>LaReau </em>v. <em>Reincke, </em>158 Conn. 486, 492, 264 A.2d 576 (1969); <em>In re Nunez, </em>165 Conn. 435, 438, 334 A.2d 898 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>(1973). In this case, the legislature chose to confer exclusive appellate jurisdiction in appeals under the TTAPA to \u201cthe court of common pleas in the county wherein the aggrieved person resides . . . .\u201d \u201c \u2018The decisive question here involves the appellate jurisdiction of a particular . . . court to review a particular administrative decision; \u201cvenue\u201d in the usual sense is not involved.\u2019 \u201d <em>State ex rel. State Tax Commission </em>v. <em>Luten, </em>459 S.W.2d 375, 377 (Mo. 1970).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> See also <em>Minnesota Valley Canning Co. </em>v. <em>Rehnblom, </em>242 Iowa 1112, 49 N.W.2d 553 (1951); 2 Cooper, State Administrative Law (1st Ed. 1965), pp. 613-14. \u201cIn many instances matters of venue are not determined either by general venue statutes or by statutes relating generally to actions against public officers but by specific provisions as to venue in administrative procedure acts or statutes relating to particular adminstrative agencies.\u201d 2 Am. Jur. 2d, Administrative Law \u00a7 737. See also 73 C.J.S., Public Administrative Bodies and Procedure \u00a726 (2), p. 320. Moreover, our conclusion that the provisions of \u00a7 4-183 (b), as it was when the plaintiff took his appeal, were mandatory and not directory, is buttressed by the fact that \u00a7 4-183 selectively used the words \u201cshall\u201d and \u201cmay\u201d in a number of its subsections. Section 4-183 (b) provided that \u201c[proceedings for review <em>shall </em>be instituted by filing a petition in the court of common <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>pleas in the county wherein the aggrieved person resides . . . (Emphasis added.) It also stated that \u201c[c]opies of the petition <em>shall </em>he served upon the agency and all parties of record.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Section 4-183 (e), for example, provided \u201c[t]he agency <em>may </em>grant, or the reviewing court <em>may </em>order, a stay upon appropriate terms.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The use of \u201cshall\u201d and \u201cmay\u201d which are words \u201ccommonly mandatory and directory in connotation, [is] a factor that evidences affirmative selectivity of terms with specific intent to he distinctive in meaning. . . . [They] must then he assumed to have been used with discrimination and a full awareness of the difference in their ordinary meanings.\u201d <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Civil Service Commission, </em>175 Conn. 504, 509, 400 A.2d 721 (1978). See <em>Shulman </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>154 Conn. 426, 428-29, 226 A.2d 380 (1967); <em>Blake </em>v. <em>Meyer, </em>145 Conn. 612, 616, 145 A.2d 584 (1958). There is nothing in \u00a7 4-183 (h) expressive of any contrary intent. Thus, the words \u201cshall\u201d and \u201cmay\u201d should he interpreted according to their plain and ordinary meaning. General Statutes \u00a7 1-1; <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Civil Service Commission, </em>supra.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> As further support for our conclusion that the venue provision of \u00a74-183 (h) is mandatory, we point to General Statutes \u00a7 38-62 (c) which in providing for appeals from certain orders of the insurance commissioner pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>vides that \u201c [a]ny person aggrieved by any such order of the commissioner <em>may </em>appeal therefrom in accordance with the provisions of <em>section 4-183, </em>except venue for such appeal <em>shall </em>be in the judicial district of Hartford-New Britain.\u201d (Emphasis added). The venue provisions of \u00a7 4-183 (b) are jurisdictional and \u201cmandatory, and, if not complied with, render the appeal subject to abatement. <em>Daley </em>v. <em>Board of Police Commissioners, </em>133 Conn. 716, 719, 54 A.2d 501 [1947].\u201d <em>Royce </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>supra, 587; see <em>Savings Bank of Danbury </em>v. <em>Downs, </em>74 Conn. 87, 49 A. 913 (1901).</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">The fact that the legislature subsequently amended the statute to allow the <em>very </em>act which it had previously not allowed, i.e., to institute the action by petition filed in the Superior Court for Hartford County, is not persuasive and does not support the plaintiff\u2019s claim. See <em>City Council </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>180 Conn. 243, 251, 429 A.2d 481 (1980). \u201cA statute which provides that a thing shall be done in a certain way carries with it an implied prohibition against doing that thing in any other way.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Barlow </em>v. <em>Kaminsky, </em>144 Conn. 612, 620, 136 A.2d 792 (1957); see <em>State ex rel. Barnard </em>v. <em>Ambrogio, </em>162 Conn. 491, 498, 294 A.2d 529 (1972). Moreover, it is well settled that it can be assumed that in amending \u00a7 4-183 (b), the legislature acted \u201cto accomplish some purpose\u201d; <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Cato, </em>147 Conn. 418, 421, 162 A.2d 175 (1960); see <em>In re Application of Plantamura, </em>149 Conn. 111, 176 A.2d 61 (1961), cert. denied, 369 U.S. 872, 82 S.

Ed. 2d 275 (1962); and \u201cwe may not presume that the legislature has enacted futile or meaningless legislation.\u201d <em>Hartford Electric Light Co. </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>161 Conn. 145, 152, 285 A.2d 352 (1971). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>\u201c \u2018 \u201cThe General Assembly is always presnmed to know all the existing statutes and the effect that its action or non-action will have upon any one of them. And it is always presumed to have intended that effect which its action or non-action produces.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Staub, </em>61 Conn. 553, 566, 23 A. 924 [1892]; <em>Coombs </em>v. <em>Darling, </em>116 Conn. 643, 646, 166 A. 70 [1933]; <em>Hartley </em>v. <em>Vitiello, </em>[113 Conn. 74, 82, 154 A. 255] [1931].\u2019 <em>Knoll </em>v. <em>Kelley, </em>142 Conn. 592, 595, 115 A.2d 678 [1955].\u201d <em>New Haven Water Co. </em>v. <em>North Branford, </em>174 Conn. 556, 565, 392 A.2d 456 (1978). At the time that the plaintiff filed his appeal, the only court with subject matter jurisdiction was the Court of Common Pleas for New Haven County.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">The plaintiff has also claimed that his administrative appeal should not fail for improper venue because General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 51-347b and 51-351<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> operate to transfer the appeal to the proper court. The court, however, was powerless to so act under these statutes as claimed.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number><em>\u201cA </em>court has no power or jurisdiction to order a change of venue where it has no jurisdiction of the subject matter of the parties defendant.\u201d 92 C.J.S.

See <em>Bell </em>v. <em>Union Trust Co. of Indianapolis, </em>213 Ind. 333, 12 N.E.2d 510 (1938); <em>Newell </em>v. <em>Huston, </em>35 App. Div. 2d 908, 317 N.Y.S.2d 66 (1970). Proceedings conducted or decisions made by a court are legally void where there is an absence of jurisdiction over the subject matter. <em>Marshall </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>170 Conn. 199, 205, 365 A.2d 1202 (1976); see <em>Chrysler Credit Corporation </em>v. <em>Fair-field Chrysler-Plymouth, Inc., </em>180 Conn. 223, 229, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>429 A.2d 478 <em>(1980); Krueger </em>v. <em>Krueger, </em>179 Conn. 488, 493, 427 A.2d 400 (1980).

Although not crucial on the specific issue before us, it is clearly a factor of the continuing legislative determination, at least in \u00a7 4-183, not only to use them according to their commonly accepted meaning, but with discrimination as to their connotations. See <em>Mazzola, </em>v. <em>Southern New England Telephone Co., </em>169 Conn. 344, 365, 363 A.2d 170 (1975).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b217-6\"> General Statutes \u00a7 51-347b, at the time of the plaintiff\u2019s appeal to the Court of Common Pleas, was codified as \u00a7 52-31 and provided: \u201cTRANSFER of causes by motion, agreement or chief court administrator.

The chief court administrator may, on his own motion, when required for the efficient operation of the courts and to insure the prompt and proper administration of justice, order like transfers. Upon the order of the court or the chief court administrator and the notices to the parties or on the filing of such stipulation, the clerk of the court shall transfer the files in the cause to the clerk of the court for such other county or judicial district, and, if simply the trial of an issue or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>issues in such cause has been transferred, the flies, after such issues have been disposed of, shall be returned to the clerk of the court for the original county or judicial district, and judgment may be entered in such court.

No cause shall fail on the ground that it has been made returnable to an improper location.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A0q\">The dissent indicates that $ 31-351 should be applied retroactively to a pending ease. We do not agree. This statute, which was enacted as Public Acts 1977, No. 77-576, \u00a7 10, did not become effective until July 1, 1978, which was after the plaintiff brought his aetion in the Court of Common Pleas at Hartford. \u201cIt is a rule of construction that statutes are not to be applied retroactively to pending actions, unless the legislature clearly expresses an intent that they shall be so applied.\u201d <em>New Haven </em>v. <em>Public Utilities Commission, </em>165 Conn. 687, 726, 345 A.2d 563 (1974). \u201cThe test of whether a .statute is to be applied retroactively, absent an express legislative intent, \u2018is not a purely mechanical one\u2019 and even if it is a procedural statute, which ordinarily will be applied retroactively without a legislative imperative to the contrary, \u2018it will not be applied retroactively if considerations of good sense and justice dictate that it not be so applied. <em>Lavieri </em>v. <em>Ulysses . . . </em>[149 Conn. 396, 401, 180 A.2d 632] [1962]; <em>E.

This case marks the first time this court has held that failure to comply with a statutory venue provision constitutes a defect in jurisdiction over the subject matter. \u201cVenue is not a jurisdictional question but a procedural one.\u201d 77 Am. Jur. 2d, Venue $ 1. A statutory requirement fixing the place where an action must be brought is regarded as existing for the convenience of the litigants and simply confers a privilege not to be required to attend court at a particular location. Id., \u00a7 45. Accordingly, it may be waived by the parties, unlike subject matter jurisdiction, which cannot be conferred by consent. Ibid. Heretofore we have followed these well-established principles in distinguishing venue from jurisdiction. <em>Guerriero </em>v. <em>Galasso, </em>144 Conn. 600, 604, 136 A.2d 497 (1957); <em>Fine </em>v. <em>Wencke, </em>117 Conn. 683, 684, 169 A. 58 (1933); <em>Mower </em>v. <em>State Department of Health, </em>108 Conn. 74, 77, 142 A. 473 (1928). In <em>Savings Bank of Danbury </em>v. <em>Downs, </em>74 Conn. 87, 89-90, 49 A. 913 (1901), a case cited by the majority, where the statute specified that a scire facias action against a garnishee should be brought to the court where the judgment had been rendered, noncomplianee was treated as jurisdictional. The court viewed this requirement, however, as created not for the bene<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>fit of a party but as resting upon the \u201cdeeper foundation\u201d of the public interest in keeping all of the records pertaining to a case at one location.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">The majority opinion concludes that strict compliance with the place requirement for filing an appeal is necessary because of its nature as a creature of statute. All of the cases of this court which are cited in support of that proposition involve noncomplianee with a time specification rather than a designation of court location. <em>Royce </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>177 Conn. 584, 418 A.2d 939 (1979); <em>Vecchio </em>v. <em>Sewer Authority, </em>176 Conn. 497, 408 A.2d 254 (1979); <em>In re Nunez, </em>165 Conn. 435, 334 A.2d 898 (1973); <em>LaReau </em>v. <em>Reincke, </em>158 Conn. 486, 264 A.2d 576 (1969); <em>Chanosky </em>v. <em>City Building Supply Co., </em>152 Conn. 449, 208 A.2d 337 (1965); <em>Daley </em>v. <em>Board of Police Commissioners, </em>133 Conn. 716, 54 A.2d 501 (1947). Time limitations for taking appeals do not exist merely for the convenience of the parties but involve a strong public interest in the finality of legal proceedings. For this reason they have been generally regarded as jurisdictional. 2 Am. Jur. 2d, Administrative Law \u00a7 719. Defects of venue in appeals from administrative agencies have not been given the same effect. <em>Industrial Addition Assn. </em>v. <em>Commissioner, </em>323 U.S. 310, 65 S. Ct. 289, 89 L.

In two cases decided by this court, both administrative agency appeals, the contention that a failure to bring an appeal to the proper court location destroyed subject matter jurisdiction was expressly rejected. <em>Guerriero </em>v. <em>Galasso, </em>supra, 604; <em>Mower </em>v. <em>State Department of Health, </em>supra, 77. Such a deviation from the statute creating the right of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>appeal \u201cis merely one in venne, for the Superior Court is one court for the whole State.\u201d <em>Mower </em>v. <em>State Department of Health, </em>supra. The use of the mandatory \u201cshall\u201d in the statutory designation of venue was not regarded as precluding the application of this familiar venue principle. <em>Guerriero </em>v. <em>Galasso, </em>supra; see General Statutes (1955 Sup.) \u00a7 379d. It is not clear from the silent treatment given to these precedents in the majority opinion whether they are being overruled or disregarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">An additional reason for my disagreement is the enactment of General Statutes \u00a7 51-351 which became effective on July 1, 1978, while this action was pending in the trial court but before the trial court decided the motion to dimiss.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This statute provides that \u201c[n]o cause shall fail on the ground that it has been made returnable to an improper location.\u201d The rationale of the majority is that, despite this statute, a venue defect in an administrative appeal goes to subject matter jurisdiction the absence of which deprives the court of any power to transfer a case. This view is wholly inconsistent with the action this court has taken on numerous occasions in transferring appeals properly within the jurisdiction of the appellate session of the Superior Court to that court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 3076 and in accepting appeals transferred to us from that court for a lack of jurisdiction pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 1068. It is also contrary to our conclusion upholding the exercise of the power to transfer cases brought to the wrong court as formerly authorized by General Statutes \u00a7 52-32 (repealed effective July 1, 1978, Public Acts 1976, No. 76-436, \u00a7148). <em>Chieppo </em>v. <em>Robert E. McMichael, Inc., </em>169 Conn. 646, 651, 363 A.2d 1085 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>(1975); <em>Felletter </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>133 Conn. 277, 280, 50 A.2d 81 (1946); <em>Wooley </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>105 Conn. 671, 673, 136 A. 583 (1927). Jurisdiction is simply the power of the court to act in the particular situation. If a rule of practice can confer authority to transfer, a fortiori the legislature, which is constitutionally authorized to define the \u201cpower and jurisdiction\u201d of the court subject to the limitation that its essential characteristics not be changed; <em>Styles </em>v. <em>Tyler, </em>64 Conn. 432, 456, 30 A. 165 (1894); may do so. Conn. Const., art. V $ 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">There can hardly be any question but that the legislature intended to authorize the transfer of cases such as the appeal of this plaintiff in enacting \u00a7 51-351, because there is no other established mechanism for implementing this declaration of policy. Already in existence was \u00a7 51-347b which authorized transfer of \u201c[a]ny cause\u201d by order of the court on its own motion or the motion of any party. The use of the broader word \u201ccause\u201d in this statute, as well as in \u00a7 51-351, instead of \u201caction\u201d makes it clear that the authority to transfer extends to administrative appeals as well as ordinary civil actions. <em>Connecticut Light and Power Co. </em>v. <em>Costle, </em>179 Conn. 415, 423, 426 A.2d 1324 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">Because the position of the majority that a venue defect defeats jurisdiction over the subject matter renders \u00a7 51-351 wholly nugatory even in respect to appeals commenced after its effective date, consideration of whether this statute should be applied retroactively in the pending case has been relegated to a footnote in the majority opinion. \u201c[A]s regards statutes which are general in their terms and affect matters of procedure, the presumption is that they are intended to apply in all actions, whether pend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>ing or not.\u201d <em>E. M. Loew\u2019s Enterprises, Inc. </em>v. <em>International Alliance, </em>127 Conn. 415, 418, 17 A.2d 525 (1941); <em>Zalewski </em>v. <em>Waterbury Mfg. Co., </em>89 Conn. 46, 48, 92 A. 682 (1914); see 73 Am. Jur. 2d, Statutes \u00a7 354. The enactment of \u00a7 51-351 was intended as a procedural reform and it does not affect any substantive rights. See <em>Sherry H. </em>v. <em>Probate Court, </em>177 Conn. 93, 101, 411 A.2d 931 (1979). The location of the courtroom where a case is to be heard can hardly be classified as substantive. I think we should honor the legislative mandate that \u201cno cause shall fail\u201d for a venue defect and follow the rule recognized by the majority that a procedural statute not changing substantive rights should ordinarily be given retroactive effect unless \u201cconsiderations of good sense and justice dictate that it not be so applied.\u201d <em>Carvette </em>v. <em>Marion Power Shovel Co., </em>157 Conn. 92, 96, 249 A.2d 58 (1968). What the considerations are which have induced the majority not to adhere to this principle I am unable to ascertain.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">I would find error in the granting of the motion to dismiss because the venue defect relied upon does not involve jurisdiction and because the legislature\u2019s intention in enacting \u00a7 51-351 was to provide the remedy of transfer rather than dismissal in such a situation. Therefore, I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">In this opinion Parskey, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b221-6\"> The motion to dismiss was not filed until April 25, 1979.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
