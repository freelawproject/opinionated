The trial court divided six savings accounts issued in the name of the defendant wife, Sophie K. Salvio, in trust for Gerald and Deborah Salvio, children of the parties, equally between the defendant and the plaintiff husband, Fred E. Salvio, co-trustee of one account. The defendant appeals that decision and certain other orders arising out of the marital dissolution.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-8\">Fred and Sophie Salvio were married in 1959 and had two children, Gerald, born in 1960, and Deborah, bom in 1962. In 1978 the plaintiff, Fred Salvio, brought an action for divorce. The defendant counterclaimed, seeking dissolution of the marriage, custody of Deborah, at that time still a minor, and various financial benefits. At a protracted series of hearings the parties testified to the existence of twelve savings accounts, eight at the Berlin Savings Bank and four at the American Savings Bank of Newington. The latter accounts, two issued to the defendant as tmstee for Gerald and two as trustee for Deborah, contained at the time of trial approximately $50,000. They were not included by the trial court in its decision and are not at issue in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>this appeal. Of the eight accounts at the Berlin Savings Bank, two were conceded to be irrevocable trusts and hence unavailable to either party; those accounts contained approximately $200. The six remaining Berlin Savings Bank accounts, containing approximately $25,000, are the focus of this appeal. Three accounts were in trust for Gferald and three for Deborah; Sophie Salvio was named trustee in five, Sophie or Fred Salvio in one.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">At trial both parties agreed that these accounts were established by the defendant as a fund for the children\u2019s college education.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Although the defendant retained possession of the bank books and the plaintiff made only one deposit, the plaintiff knew of the existence of these accounts and of their purpose. The defendant testified to withdrawing funds from the accounts on one occasion to purchase a car and later replacing the amount withdrawn.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> All other withdrawals were for the purpose of opening new accounts in trust for the children. The sources of the funds deposited included the earnings of both parties, the defendant\u2019s inheritance, and gifts to the children.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">In its memorandum of decision the trial court ordered that the funds in the six accounts at the Berlin Savings Bank be divided equally between the parties. The court further ordered that $3000 of the plaintiff\u2019s share be held in escrow until resolution of certain disputed claims under a previous court order. After awarding custody of the minor child <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>to the defendant, ordering the plaintiff to pay $175 per week in alimony, denying child support, and dividing other assets of the marriage, the court denied counsel fees to both parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">On appeal to this court, the defendant\u2019s principal claim of error is the inclusion by the trial court of the six Berlin Savings Bank accounts in its division of marital property. The defendant also claims error in the court\u2019s order placing $3000 of the plaintiff\u2019s share in escrow; in the court\u2019s failure to act on the defendant\u2019s motion for contempt against the plaintiff; in the amount of the court\u2019s award of alimony and its denial of child support; in the allocation of the parties\u2019 assets; and in the denial of counsel fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b326-7\">The defendant claims that the disputed accounts at the Berlin Savings Bank were beyond the trial court\u2019s jurisdiction to allocate because they were irrevocable trusts owned by the beneficiaries, Gerald and Deborah. Since the beneficiaries, the true owners of the property, were not made parties to the dissolution action, she argues, the trial court could not order the disposition of a trust corpus based merely on the parties\u2019 status as trustees. The first issue before us, then, is the determination of the rights of trustees and beneficiaries in savings bank trust accounts. Such a determination is a prerequisite to adjudication of the Superior Court\u2019s jurisdiction to allocate such property in a marital dissolution action.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-8\">Because the issue before us is one of first impression in this state, it is important to put the savings account trust, now statutory, into its historical context. A savings account trust arises when a bank <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>depositor establishes an account in trust for a named beneficiary while reserving to himself, as trustee, the right to withdraw the funds in that account at any time. Upon the trustee\u2019s death, ownership of the funds remaining on deposit passes automatically to the beneficiary. Originally such trusts were viewed as enforceable only if they could be found to be irrevocable. <em>Minor </em>v. <em>Rogers, </em>40 Conn. 512, 521 (1873); <em>McCaffrey </em>v. <em>North Adams Savings Bank, </em>244 Mass. 396, 398, 138 N.E. 393 (1923). Revocable trusts were often held ineffective as testamentary dispositions violative of the Statute of Wills. <em>Day Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Malden Savings Bank, </em>328 Mass. 576, 579, 105 N.E.2d 363 (1952); <em>HogarthSwann </em>v. <em>Steele, </em>294 Mass. 396, 398, 2 N.E.2d 446 (1936). New York courts, however, early in this century validated such trusts, often called Totten trusts after the leading case, as tentative trusts capable of transmitting a legal interest in the funds on deposit at the depositor\u2019s death. <em>In re Totten, </em>179 N.Y. 112, 125-26, 71 N.E. 748 (1904). This is the view endorsed by the Restatement (Second), Trusts \u00a7 58 (1959) and by I Scott, Trusts (3d Ed. 1967) \u00a7 58.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-4\">Each of these analyses of savings bank trust accounts proved in some sense unsatisfactory. As this court recognized in <em>Driscoll </em>v. <em>Norwich Savings Society, </em>139 Conn. 346, 350, 93 A.2d 925 (1952), savings accounts that purport to transfer ownership of deposits are so hybrid in concept that they call out for a sui generis treatment by statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">The earliest Connecticut statute to address this need provided procedures for the creation of savings account trusts and absolved banks from any liability for payment of funds on deposit at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>depositor\u2019s death, to the named beneficiary. General Statutes \u00a75829 (1949 Rev.).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> After this court declared such payments to be in violation of the Statute of Wills; <em>Fasano </em>v. <em>Meliso, </em>146 Conn. 496, 500, 152 A.2d 512 (1959); the legislature responded with a more elaborate statute validating these death transfers.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The court\u2019s concern in <em>Fasano </em>that \u201cthere was no evidence whatsoever of any intention that title to [the accounts] or any interest in them should leave the decedent prior to his death\u201d was remedied by the legislature\u2019s conclusive presumption of the depositor\u2019s intent that \u201cif the named beneficiary survives the depositor, the depositor\u2019s death shall terminate the trust and the moneys to the credit of the trust shall vest in the named beneficiary free and clear of the trust.\u201d Public Acts 1961, No. 306, \u00a71 (e).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> This statutory presumption was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>clearly added to eliminate any need for the evidence of intent found lacking in <em>Fasano. </em>It survives verbatim in the present version of the statute, General Statutes \u00a7 36-110,* <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> which also specifies as a condition of the presumption that the depositor may freely withdraw the funds on deposit during his lifetime. General Statutes \u00a736-110 (1) (a) (1).</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">The defendant claims that a trust established under the provisions of \u00a7 36-110 not only creates a valid statutory trust, even though it fails to satisfy the Statute of Wills, but also creates a valid present interest in the beneficiary, unless a contrary inten<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>tion is indicated at the time the account is established. In support of this view the defendant invokes the 1965 revision of \u00a7 36-110, which deleted the statement that \u201c[t]he trust shall be revocable at will bythe depositor during his life\u201d and substituted the statement that \u201c[t]he depositor during his life may withdraw, or authorize charges against, the moneys to the credit of the trust.\u201d She argues that the deletion of the term \u201crevocable\u201d can only mean that the legislature intended savings account trusts to become irrevocable, with the depositor authorized by statute to withdraw funds solely to effectuate the purposes of the trust. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">An examination of the legislative history for \u00a7 36-110 reveals that the 1965 revision was intended to clarify the tax status of savings account trusts but to leave unaltered the substance of the statute. At hearings on the proposed revision, Representative Floyd A. Laird of Sharon described the modified bill as \u201can act clarifying the presumptions relating to savings deposits in trust to avoid unintended succession tax consequences\u201d occasioned by the term \u201crevocable,\u201d which signaled automatic liability to the state succession tax. See 11 H. R. Proc., Pt. 3, 1965 Sess., p. 1313. He later asserted that \u201cthis language which is changed, merely says the same thing but in a different way . . . .\u201d 11 H. R. Proc., supra, 1314-15; see 11 S. Proc., Pt. 3, 1965 Sess., p. 1169; Conn. Joint Standing Committee Hearings, Banks, 1965 Sess., pp. 116-19, 133-34., There is no basis for the defendant\u2019s contention that after 1965 savings account trusts became irrevocable and that consequently the beneficiaries\u2019 interest vested irrevocably when the trusts were created.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">Under the present statute it is perfectly clear, as we stated in <em>Manulik </em>v. <em>Devitt, </em>176 Conn. 663, 668, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>410 A.2d 469 (1979), that savings account trusts cannot be treated as irrevocable, because they allow the depositor an unlimited power of invasion in his lifetime. That conclusion does not, however, dispose of the argument in this case. Even as a tentative trust, a savings account trust might be viewed as conferring sufficient rights on a named beneficiary to make him a necessary party to a marital dissolution action in which such a trust was to be allocated by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">The question of when a beneficiary\u2019s interest in a savings account trust actually arises is a crucial and troublesome one that has long exercised courts and commentators. See I Scott, Trusts (3d Ed. 1967) \u00a7\u00a7 58.4A, 330.3; \u201cSavings Account Trusts: A Critical Examination,\u201d 49 Notre Dame Lawyer 686, 694 (1974); \u201cBank Account Trusts,\u201d 49 Va. L. Rev. 1189, 1192-94 (1963). With celebrated ambivalence, the savings account trust seems to gaze at once in opposite directions. As a revocable trust, it suggests that the beneficiary gains some interest, however impermanent, in the funds deposited at the time the trust is created. As a tentative trust, however, it suggests that the beneficiary gains no interest until the tentative quality of the trust is extinguished by the depositor\u2019s death. The two characterizations are not always used with precision; the Bestatement asserts that \u201c[a] tentative trust of a savings deposit can be revoked by the depositor at any time during his lifetime\u201d; Bestatement (Second), Trusts \u00a7 58, p. 157 (1959); effectively blurring any distinction between revocable and tentative trusts. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>State National Bank of Connecticut, </em>421 F.2d 519, 520 (2d Cir. 1970); <em>In re Totten, </em>179 N.Y. 112, 125-26, 71 N.E. 748 (1904). This imprecision in describing the consequences of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>savings account trusts occurs because the strict terminology of trust doctrine applies imperfectly to a categorically hybrid construct that straddles the boundaries of trust, banking, and testamentary law.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\">In some areas, however, the rights and obligations created by savings account trusts have been clarified. It is generally accepted that the funds on deposit may be reached by the depositor\u2019s creditors during his lifetime and, if he dies insolvent, after his death. See <em>In re Chaikowsky, 94 </em>Misc. 2d 70, 71, 404 N.Y.S.2d 510 (1978); Restatement (Second), Trusts \u00a7 58, p. 157 (1959); Scott, supra, $ 58.5. The depositor remains liable for income tax on interest earned by the funds, and his estate assumes liability for federal estate and state succession taxes. See 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 674; General Statutes \u00a7 12-345; <em>Wasserman </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Internal Revenue, </em>139 F.2d 778, 779-80 (1st Cir. 1944); Scott, supra, \u00a7 58.3, p. 535; \u201cSavings Account Trusts,\u201d supra, 695; \u201cBank Account Trusts,\u201d supra, 1206. Although there is no such consensus on the right of a spouse to reach funds deposited in savings account trusts when computing an elective share of the depositor\u2019s estate, the prevailing view is that, since the decedent spouse exercised such complete power over the funds during his lifetime, the surviving spouse <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>should he permitted to include them.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Restatement, supra, pp. 157-58; Scott, supra, \u00a7 58.5, pp. 544-48; \u201cSavings Account Trusts,\u201d supra, 696-98; \u201cBank Account Trusts,\u201d supra, 1202-1205.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-4\">The unresolved issue before us, then, is whether the parties\u2019 children as beneficiaries of the savings account trusts established by their parents presently have a beneficial interest in those accounts sufficient to require their participation in the dissolution action before the trial court can take jurisdiction of the funds on deposit. In addressing that issue, we look first to the language of \u00a7 36-110 and then to this court\u2019s interpretation of that provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">Section 36-110 requires a depositor establishing a trust account to furnish a signed statement giving the beneficiary\u2019s name and residence. It also, however, provides that \u201c[s]uch statement may also specify the terms of the trust thereby created.\u201d Only in the absence of any statement to the contrary does the statute\u2019s conclusive presumption come into being. It is undisputed that the six Berlin Savings Bank accounts at issue were opened by the defendant without the addition of any terms limit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>ing or otherwise describing the nature of the trust created. The defendant could have established irrevocable trusts for her children; she could also have authorized herself to make withdrawals only to further the children\u2019s education. In fact she chose to do neither. That the defendant understood her unlimited power over the funds is demonstrated by her testimony that she withdrew money from one of the children\u2019s accounts to buy a car and then replaced that money. The defendant now seeks to have the restrictions available to her at will imposed retroactively by this court through its interpretation of the controlling statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">This court had occasion most recently to construe \u00a7 36-110 in <em>Manulik </em>v. <em>Devitt, </em>176 Conn. 663, 410 A.2d 469 (1979), a case involving the ownership of a savings account trust following the depositor\u2019s death. We there concluded that 36-110 gives effect to the intention of the depositor to make a \u2018poor man\u2019s will,\u2019 but at the same time to retain the sole right to the moneys during Ms lifetime. . . . By virtue of the statute\u2019s conclusive presumption regarding the depositor-trustee\u2019s intent, therefore, the defendant in the present case, as beneficiary, acquired all rights to the funds contained in the account upon the death of her mother.\u201d <em>Manulik </em>v. <em>Devitt, </em>supra, 668. Following <em>Manulik, </em>we read \u00a7 36-110 to mean that the beneficiary of an unqualified savings account trust acquires no legal interest in the funds on deposit until the death of the depositor. Although an earlier case; <em>Fruchtman </em>v. <em>Manning, </em>156 Conn. 500, 242 A.2d 723 (1968) ;<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> made no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>mention of \u00a7 36-110 and instead required evidence of intent on the part of the depositor to create a beneficial interest in the beneficiary prior to the depositor\u2019s death, we conclude today that the statutory presumption replaces any such test of intent. Our reading of \u00a7 36-110 is further strengthened by a Second Circuit opinion, applying Connecticut law, which observed that \u201c[i]t is well established that accounts deposited in a bank by the depositor in trust for another are tentative trusts only, revocable at will until the depositor dies or completes the gift in his or her lifetime by some unequivocal act or declaration.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>State National Bank of Connecticut, </em>421 F.2d 519, 520 (2d Cir. 1970). In the absence of any unequivocal act by the defendant rendering the savings account trusts irrevocable or otherwise transferring ownership rights to the beneficiaries, we conclude that Gerald and Deborah held no beneficial interest in the accounts at the time of the dissolution of their parents\u2019 marriage.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">Courts in other jurisdictions have approved trial court decisions both including savings account trusts for the parties\u2019 children among divisible marital assets; <em>Meinders </em>v. <em>Meinders, </em>305 N.W.2d 404, 407 (S.D. 1981); <em>Karr </em>v. <em>Karr, </em>628 P.2d 267, 278 (Mont. 1981), cert. denied, 455 U.S. 1016, 102 S. Ct. 1709, 72 L. Ed. 2d 132 (1982); <em>Marrone </em>v. <em>Marrone, </em>69 A.D.2d 898, 415 N.Y.S.2d 892 (1979); and reserving such accounts exclusively for the children\u2019s use. <em>St. Clair </em>v. <em>St. Clair, </em>273 S.E.2d 352, 355-56 (W. Va. 1980); <em>Mitchely </em>v. <em>Mitchely, </em>237 Ga. 138, 139, 227 S.E.2d 34 (1976). We are persuaded that, in light of our statutory presumption and the facts of the present case, the proper course is to hold these sav<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>ings account trusts to be property of the marriage.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Since the trial court did not discuss its omission of the American Savings Bank accounts from its division of assets and neither party has challenged that, omission, we need not decide whether the trial court properly had discretion to distinguish between those accounts and the Berlin Savings Bank accounts at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">Since Gerald and Deborah had acquired no legal interest in the funds on deposit, they were not necessary parties for the purpose of establishing the trial court\u2019s jurisdiction over those accounts.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> See Nelson, Divorce and Annulment (2d Ed. 1961) \u00a7 22.06. The fact that Deborah was a minor at the time of trial in no way distinguishes her situation from that of her brother. Although it was within the trial court\u2019s discretion to appoint counsel for her; General Statutes \u00a746b-54; <em>Kearney </em>v. <em>State, </em>174 Conn. 244, 251, 386 A.2d 223 (1978); the exis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>tence of the savings account trusts did not compel such an appointment.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The trial court did not err in failing to join the children as parties to their parents\u2019 dissolution action.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">The defendant also claims that the trial court erred in two respects by ordering that $3000 of the plaintiff\u2019s share of the savings account trusts be placed in escrow for payment of bills owing under a January 19, 1979 pendente lite order. First, the defendant reiterates her position that those funds were not available to the trial court for distribution to the plaintiff; we have already resolved that question against the defendant. Second, she argues that since the final judgment erased the pendente lite order under which the plaintiff had been directed to pay certain of the defendant\u2019s expenses, the trial court erred in rendering that judgment before the plaintiff\u2019s duties under the January 19 order were resolved by either payment of sums due or a finding of civil contempt.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-7\">The defendant is correct that the January 19,1979 pendente lite order was \u201cinterlocutory in nature and terminate [d] with the rendition of the final judgment.\u201d <em>Rodearmel </em>v. <em>Rodearmel, </em>173 Conn. 273, 276, 377 A.2d 260 (1977); see <em>Yontef </em>v. <em>Yontef, </em>185 Conn. 275, 291, 440 A.2d 899 (1981); <em>Tobey </em>v. <em>Tobey, </em>165 Conn. 742, 745, 345 A.2d 21 (1974); <em>Saunders </em>v. <em>Saunders, </em>140 Conn. 140, 146, 98 A.2d 815 (1953). Such termination does not, however, mean that the trial court was powerless to hear testimony concerning the plaintiff\u2019s alleged viola<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>tions of tlie earlier order and to include remedies for those violations in its final judgment. The record makes clear that the trial court explicitly instructed the defendant\u2019s counsel to introduce testimony of sums owed to her by the plaintiff under the earlier order so that the court could consider that testimony in shaping its order.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Although the plaintiff can no longer be punished for contempt under the earlier order; see <em>Nowell </em>v. <em>Nowell, </em>157 Conn. 470, 483, 254 A.2d 889, cert. denied, 396 U.S. 844, 90 S. Ct. 68, 24 L. Ed. 2d 94, after remand, 163 Conn. 116, 302 A.2d 260 (1969); he can be compelled by the trial court to pay $3000 for disputed claims incorporated in the new order. The trial court was not obliged to resolve the defendant\u2019s motion for contempt before rendering its judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">The defendant next challenges the trial court\u2019s award of $175 per week in alimony to the defendant, its denial of child support for the parties\u2019 one minor child, and its division of the parties\u2019 assets. These decisions all rest within the trial court\u2019s discretion, guided by the statutory criteria provided by General Statutes \u00a7\u00a746b-81 (c), 46b-82, and 46b-84 (b).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> \u201cThe issue is not whether we would have made the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>same assessment, but rather whether the trial court was bound to take a different view.\u201d <em>Yontef </em>v. <em>Yontef, </em>supra, 286.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">The record amply supports the trial court\u2019s decision. Although the court found that the defendant had no income and was effectively unemployable, it also found both parties to be in very poor health and the plaintiff unable to maintain the level of his prior earnings. The plaintiff was not ordered by the March decision to pay child support for the parties\u2019 minor child \u201cbecause she will be eighteen years of age in September and there is available for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>her support over twenty-five thousand dollars from the marital assets.\u201d The trial court divided the parties\u2019 marital assets equitably, with the defendant receiving the family home valued at $90,000 and the plaintiff retaining his interests in the D.S.O. Manufacturing Company, the D.S.O. Realty Company, and the D.S.O. profit sharing plan, together valued at over $100,000. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in arriving at this allotment of assets; it was not bound to take a different view. <em>Yontef </em>v. <em>Yontef, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">Finally, the defendant claims error in the trial court\u2019s denial of counsel fees because she has no resources from which to pay her legal expenses. This claim is rooted in her earlier contention, rejected by us, that the $25,000 savings account trusts were not available for distribution to the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-7\">The standards guiding the trial court\u2019s grant or denial of counsel fees are set forth at General Statutes \u00a7 46b-82.
