Healey, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ap8\">The defendant was charged with burglary in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-101 (a) (2) and unlawful restraint in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a753a-95 (a). The jury returned guilty verdicts on both counts and the defendant was sentenced to serve concurrent sentences of not less than ten nor more than twenty years and not less than two and one-half nor more than five years.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-7\">The jury could reasonably have found the following facts: On the morning of February 22, 1977, John and Martha Gulbenkian were asleep in the bedroom of their home in Fairfield. At approximately 6:30 a.m., the doorbell to the back door rang. Mr. Gulbenkian went downstairs to answer the doorbell while Mrs. Gulbenkian remained upstairs. Upon opening the door, Mr. Gulbenkian saw Tommy Watson, a messenger who worked for Mr. Gulbenkian\u2019s jewelry business at the Trumbull Shopping Park. When Mr. Gulbenkian opened the screen door to let in Watson, a man, whom Mr. Gulbenkian testified he had never seen before, came up from behind Watson and put a revolver to Mr. Gulbenkian\u2019s head, forcing him back into the house. Mr. Gulbenkian described the man as being five feet eight inches tall with a dark complexion and straight hair. He also noticed that the gunman spoke with a foreign accent or a lisp.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-8\">While holding the revolver in his left hand, the gunman ordered Mr. Gulbenkian into the living room. The gunman then tied up Mr. Gulbenkian <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>and Tom Watson. He covered Mr. Gulbenkian\u2019s head with a throw rug, put something in his mouth and secured the rug with electrical tape. The gunman threw Mr. Gulbenkian onto the floor and every couple of minutes someone would kick him in the shoulder. Mr. Gulbenkian could not see anything but heard someone else enter the house.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">In the meantime, Mrs. Gulbenkian was still in bed on the second floor when she saw two men burst through the bedroom door. One man was tall with a bandanna tied around his face while the other man, armed with a revolver, wore a gold colored vinyl or leather jacket and sunglasses. The gunman threw a bedsheet over her head and tied her up. Mrs. Gulbenkian noticed that the gunman spoke with either a foreign accent or a lisp. Mrs. Gulbenkian could not see anything but heard the men rummaging through the house as they ransacked it.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-7\">Before the two men left, they told Mrs. Gulbenkian to tell the police that three black men had burglarized the house or else they would return and kill her. They gave Mr. Gulbenkian a similar warning. After the men had left, Mr. Gulbenkian managed to remove the rug from his head, and his wife, who had freed herself, helped to untie him. Mr. Gulbenkian went into the other room and untied Watson while his wife went next door to call the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-8\">When the police arrived, the Gulbenkians told them that Watson had been an overnight guest at their home. About a week later, Mr. and Mrs. Gulbenkian changed their story to reflect the truth and told the police that Watson had not been an over<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>night guest, but had entered the house with the gunman. Both later testified that they had initially lied to the police because they had been ordered to say this and were afraid that the two men would return and kill them and because they originally believed that Watson was not involved in the robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">On appeal, the defendant basically presses two claims of error. First, he claims that the trial court erred in admitting into evidence certain testimony of the G-ulbenkians. Specifically, he alleges that their statements, which explained why they changed that part of their story relating to Watson\u2019s status as an overnight guest, were irrelevant and highly prejudicial. Second, he claims that the court erred by failing to instruct the jury that testimony, admissible under the \u201cstate of mind\u201d exception to the hearsay rule, could only be used for the limited purpose for which it was admitted.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-7\">At trial, the prosecutor asked Mr. and Mrs. Gulbenkian why they had ultimately told the police that Tommy Watson had not been staying as a house guest on the night before February 22. Both Mr. and Mrs. Gulbenkian responded, over objection, by stating that, after the incident, the Fairfield police asked them to go to Stamford to identify a picture of Watson who, the police said, had been involved in another house robbery in Stamford. Upon learn<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>ing this, the Grulbenkians felt that Watson was involved in the robbery of their own house and that they had been wrong in initially lying to the police.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>The defendant claims that this testimony was irrelevant and prejudicial because the fact that Watson was involved in similar crimes created an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>inference that a de facto conspiracy existed between the defendant, who was not charged with conspiracy, and Watson.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">It appears that the court admitted this testimony into evidence under the \u201cstate of mind\u201d exception to the hearsay rule.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u201c[W]e have recognized that a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>mental condition is a fact, that to establish it declarations of the party concerned tending to show what it was are admissible and that he may directly testify as to it.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Savage, </em>161 Conn. 445, 447, 290 A.2d 221 (1971); see <em>State </em>v. <em>Brokaw, </em>183 Conn. 29, 32, 438 A.2d 815 (1981); <em>Levy </em>v. <em>Carter Rice &amp; Co., </em>136 Conn. 216, 220, 70 A.2d 147 (1949); <em>Horowitz </em>v. <em>F.

Under the state of mind exception, proof of declarations that tend to show fear may be received. See 2 Wigmore, Evidence (Chadbourn Rev.) \u00a7 394; 29 Am. Jur. 2d, Evidence \u00a7 650. The fear of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>consequences of plain speaking is a circumstance that may he utilized to explain away the effect of a witness\u2019 prior inconsistency by relating whatever circumstances would naturally remove the prior inconsistency. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Franzese, </em>392 F.2d 954, 960 (2d Cir. 1968), vacated on other grounds, 394 U.S. 310, 89 S.

Ed. 2d 297 (1969), citing 3 Wigmore, Evidence (3d Ed.) \u00a7 1044, p. 737; see also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Pritchard, </em>458 F.2d 1036, 1039-40 ( 7th Cir.), cert. denied, 407 U.S. 911, 92 S.

Ed. 2d 297 (1969); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Carr, </em>436 Pa. 124, 127, 259 A.2d 165 (1969). The statements concerning why the Gulbenkians had changed their version of the events relating to Watson\u2019s status as an overnight guest were properly admissible under this exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">We now turn to the question of whether these statements, though otherwise admissible, were irrelevant or prejudicial to the defendant\u2019s ease. \u201c\u2018No precise and universal test of relevancy is furnished by the law, and the question must be determined in each case according to the teachings of reason and judicial experience. <em>Eason </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>169 Conn. 589, 591, 363 A.2d 1090 [1975] ; <em>State </em>v. <em>Towles, </em>155 Conn. 516, 523, 235 A.2d 639 [1967].\u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Runkles, </em>174 Conn. 405, 413, 389 A.2d 730, cert. denied, 439 U.S. 859, 99 S. Ct. 177, 58 L. Ed. 2d 168 (1978). We have noted that \u2018 \u201c[e]vidence is admissible when it tends to establish a fact in issue or to corroborate other direct evidence in the case. One fact is relevant to another fact whenever, according to the common course of events, the existence of the one, taken alone or in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>connection with other facts, renders the existence of the other either certain or more probable. Unless excluded by some rule or principle of law, any fact may be proved which logically tends to aid the trier in the determination of the issues. . . . <em>State </em>v. <em>Towles, </em>155 Conn. 516, 523, 235 A.2d 639 [1967]; <em>Pope Foundation, Inc. </em>v. <em>New York, N. H. &amp; H. R. Co., </em>106 Conn. 423, 435, 138 A. 444 [1927].\u201d\u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Villafane, </em>171 Conn. 644, 674-75, 372 A.2d 82 (1976), cert. denied, 429 U.S. 1106, 97 S. Ct. 1137, 51 L. Ed. 2d 558 (1977).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Gold, </em>180 Conn. 619, 645-46, 431 A.2d 501, cert. denied, 449 U.S. 920, 101 S. Ct. 320, 66 L. Ed. 2d 148 (1980); see <em>State </em>v. <em>Rose, </em>168 Conn. 623, 636, 362 A.2d 813 (1975). \u201cThe ruling of the court was a discretionary one and \u2018[t]he court has a wide discretion in its rulings on the relevancy of evidence.\u2019 \u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Runkles, </em>supra, 413.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">The Gulbenkians\u2019 testimony about their identification of Watson\u2019s photograph in Stamford was clearly relevant to their decision to tell the Fairfield police the truth about Watson\u2019s status in their house on the night before February 22, 1977. It tended to show that the Gulbenkians\u2019 second version of the incident was more truthful than the first because of the removal of their belief that they should protect Watson upon their discovery of his probable involvement in a similar robbery. In this respect, the testimony aided the trier in determining the credibility of the Gulbenkians and was admitted into evidence in the sound exercise of judicial discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-7\">Once the relevancy of this evidence is established, our inquiry then focuses on whether the trial court abused its discretion in ruling that the probative value of the evidence outweighed its prejudicial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>tendency. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Ryan, </em>182 Conn. 335, 337, 438 A.2d 107 (1980). The trial court has a duty to exclude evidence which, \u201cif admitted, would have a greater prejudicial than probative effect.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Mastropetre, </em>175 Conn. 512, 521, 400 A.2d 276 (1978); see <em>State </em>v. <em>Barlow, </em>177 Conn. 391, 393-94, 418 A.2d 46 (1979); <em>State </em>v. <em>Moynahan, </em>164 Conn. 560, 597, 325 A.2d 199, cert. denied, 414 U.S. 976, 94 S. Ct. 291, 38 L. Ed. 2d 219 (1973) and cases cited therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">We conclude that the defendant cannot establish any prejudicial impact upon his case resulting from the admission of this testimony into evidence. \u201cWhere a claim of an erroneous evidentiary ruling is raised on appeal, it is fundamental \u2018 \u201cthat an appellant has the burden of establishing that there has been an erroneous ruling which was probably harmful to him.\u201d <em>Casalo </em>v. <em>Claro, </em>147 Conn. 625, 630, 165 A.2d 153 [I960].\u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Mahmood, </em>158 Conn. 536, 541, 265 A.2d 83 (1969).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Dolphin, </em>178 Conn. 564, 572, 424 A.2d 266 (1979); see <em>State </em>v. <em>Grimes, </em>154 Conn. 314, 321-22, 228 A.2d 141 (1966). It is mere speculation to assume that the jury would infer from the Grulbenkians\u2019 testimony, without more, that Watson and the defendant were engaged in a conspiracy.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b621-7\">Although the defendant concedes that his claim on the admissibility of this evidence is based on evidentiary rulings, making it incumbent upon him to establish that they were erroneous and probably harmful to him; see <em>Casalo </em>v. <em>Claro, </em>supra, 630; he also argues that their prejudicial impact deprived him of a fair trial. We do not agree. The testimony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>claimed to be harmful to the defendant referred to \u201cother criminal conduct\u201d of Thomas Watson, not the defendant. If, however, arguendo, it could be said to have referred to the defendant, we must still reject such a claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">The general rule is that evidence of guilt of other crimes is inadmissible to prove that a defendant is guilty of the crime charged against him. <em>State </em>v. <em>Turcio, </em>178 Conn. 116, 129, 422 A.2d 749 (1979); <em>State </em>v. <em>Holliday, </em>159 Conn. 169, 172, 268 A.2d 368 (1970); <em>State </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>147 Conn. 589, 599, 164 A.2d 399 (1960). However, just because such evidence tends to prove the commission of other crimes by an accused does not render it inadmissible if it is otherwise relevant and material. In fact, \u201cit has been said that there are so many exceptions to the rule that it is difficult to determine which is more extensive\u2014the rule or its acknowledged exceptions.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Holliday, </em>supra. Its admission, where material and relevant, invokes a balancing test involving the exercise of judicial discretion as to whether its prejudicial tendency outweighs its probative value. <em>State </em>v. <em>Turcio, </em>supra, 129; <em>State </em>v. <em>Holliday, </em>supra, 173; see <em>United States ex rel. Bibbs </em>v. <em>Twomey, </em>506 F.2d 1220, 1222-23 (7th Cir. 1974); <em>United States ex rel. Harris </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>457 F.2d 191, 198 (7th Cir. 1972); 6 Wig-more, Evidence (Chadbourn Rev.) \u00a7 1904. \u201cReversal is required only where an abuse of discretion is manifest or where injustice appears to have been done.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Turcio, </em>supra, 129. The rule of admission of evidence of other crimes is a rule of evidence and not a rule of constitutional law. <em>Ramsey </em>v. <em>State, </em>239 Md. 561, 564, 212 A.2d 319 (1964); <em>State </em>v. <em>Pack, </em>18 Ohio App. 2d 76, 82, 246 N.E.2d 912 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>\u201cGenerally, however, the admissibility of evidence is a matter of state law and unless there is a resultant denial of fundamental fairness or the denial of a specific constitutional right, no constitutional issue is involved.\u201d <em>United States ex rel. Bibbs </em>v. <em>Twomey, </em>supra, 1222; <em>Grundler </em>v. <em>North Carolina, </em>283 F.2d 798, 802 (4th Cir. 1960). \u201cThe test for determining whether a defendant\u2019s constitutional right to a fundamentally fair trial has been violated by the admission of evidence of other crimes is the same as would be applied by a reviewing court on direct appeal in determining whether the admission of such evidence was within the permissible exercise of discretion of the trial court.\u201d <em>United States ex rel. Bibbs </em>v. <em>Twomey, </em>supra, 1223; <em>United States ex rel. Harris </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>supra, 198. We have examined the entire record and cannot conclude that the trial court\u2019s rulings on the evidence resulted in denying the defendant a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">The defendant\u2019s second claim of error relates to the court\u2019s charge to the jury. He alleges error in the court\u2019s failure to instruct the jury that the portion of the Gulbenkians\u2019 testimony admitted under the \u201cstate of mind\u201d exception to the hearsay rule could only be used for the limited purpose of assessing the Gulbenkians\u2019 credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-7\">It does not appear from the record before us that the defendant either requested the court to charge the jury as described or that he took an exception to the charge on this basis. See Practice Book \u00a7 3060F (c) (1), (2). \u201cWhere this failure occurs, there is no error in not making the charge. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Morgan, </em>170 Conn. 110, 112, 365 A.2d 99 (1976); <em>State </em>v. <em>Gerak, </em>169 Conn. 309, 316, 363 A.2d 114 (1975).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Boyd, </em>178 Conn. 600, 605, 424 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>A.2d 279 (1979). The defendant has presented us with no reason to disregard this rule, and our review of the record discloses none. See <em>State </em>v. Evans, 165 Conn. 61, 67, 327 A.2d 576 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b614-8\"> The defendant also claimed that by allowing the witnesses to explain away the inconsistencies in their stories on direct, rather than on cross-examination, he \u201cwas at a distinct disadvantage in keeping out irrelevant and prejudicial testimony.\u201d At oral argument, however, the defendant conceded that he cou,ld not claim that this procedure was improper. We therefore consider this claim of error, if it ever was a claim of error, abandoned.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b615-6\"> Direct testimony of Mr. Gulbenkian:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-7\">\u201cThe Court: Mr. Gulbenkian, tell them exactly what you told the police.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-8\">\u201cThe Witness: I told the police, we ealled them up, they came at the house.

Now, when 1 learned of the other robbery of the other jewelry\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AWLS\">\u201cMr. Thim: I object, your Honor, and may that be stricken and may the jury be excused for a moment, please?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AjP\">\u201cMr. Maco: If counsel wishes the jury to be excused, by all means, he has the right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Axv\">\u201cMr. Thim: I would like to make a motion for mistrial. I earlier requested the Court to admonish the State\u2019s Attorney that no reference be made in this trial to such and such matters.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ayn\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>\u201cThe Court: All right, I will excuse the jury. (The jury was excused at 3:15 P.M.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AhN\">\u201cMr. Thim: Your Honor, Mr. Pe\u00f1ere is on trial for one crime,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AamE\">two counts, in the Information. He is not charged with another robbery.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ATP6\">\u201cThe first State\u2019s witness had mentioned another robbery that somebody else had told them about. At that time, I jumped up, objected, and asked that it be stricken. When the jury was absent from the courtroom, I thereafter requested that the State be limited in its evidence to the extent that it not be permitted to introduce any evidence as to another robbery, as to other crimes. Now, your Honor did not make an order at that time, but I stated that my intention was known that I would request a mistrial if there was further mention of another robbery in this case. The State\u2019s Attorney was duly warned at that time. Now, there has been mention of another robbery. I don\u2019t know of any way a jury can forget that evidence. At this time I am sure that they feel that this man was involved in another robbery which is indelibly imprinted on their mind. The State\u2019s Attorney had due warning and I move at this time for a mistrial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aut\">\u201cMr. Maco: If your Honor will recall with regard to the mention of the other robbery, it was again on the basis of why the change in story with regard to Tom Watson. There\u2019s nothing whatever indicating\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A1b\">\u201cThe Court: All she had to do was say what she said to the police, really. She already testified it was because they told her what to say, that\u2019s the why.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A8XO\">\u201cNow, Mrs. Gulbenkian, just say what you told the police, not what the police told you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AJt\">\u201cThe Witness: No, that\u2019s what I am saying, your Honor. I told the police the reason I changed my story was because I heard from the police that my husband\u2014that Thomas Watson was involved in a robbery so he had to be involved in ours. Ours had to be set up.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b617-17\"> When Mrs. Gulbenkian testified, the following exchange occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aen\">\u201cQ. Why did you change the story to the police, the second time you told the story, about the status of Tom Watson in your house?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-19\">\u201cA. Because Tom Watson was identified as the person who was involved in another robbery in Stamford of another jeweler and I <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>realized then that he had to be involved in the robbery taking place in our home and we did wrong in lying for him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AO9C\">\u201cMr. Thim: Your Honor, I object, and I think the answer clearly corroborates hearsay information.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ACJ\">\u201cThe Court: That\u2019s responsive. It really would bear upon her state of mind.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A60\">\u201cMr. Maco: That\u2019s correct. That\u2019s only what the State is attempting to do, state of mind.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AD6\">\u201cThe Court: I will override the objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A8p\">\u201cMr. Thim: May an exception be noted?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Amo\">\u201cThe Court: It may be noted.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ARy\">The record is not as explicit with respect to Mr. Gulbenkian\u2019s testimony but the court apparently felt that the \u201cstate of mind\u201d exception would also allow his explanation as to why he had changed his story. After excusing the jury, but before counsel discussed the defendant\u2019s objection to this testimony, the court stated:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ali\">\u201cThe Court: Let me instruct the witness. Mr. Gulbenkian, you can only testify as to what you said to someone. You can\u2019t testify as to what they said because that\u2019s hearsay, you see?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A4H\">\u201cThe Witness: I understand, Sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ABN\">\u201cThe Court: And hearsay is not admissible. The jury is not supposed to hear that. So, when you testify, you should do it in light of: I said this to Officer so and so, I told Officer so and so that I did this and I did that and so on; all right, Sir? Do you understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A6u\">\u201cThe Witness: Yes.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b621-8\"> The record discloses no other evidence whieh would link Watson to the defendant and, in faet, when asked, upon cross-examination, the defendant denied that he knew Watson.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
