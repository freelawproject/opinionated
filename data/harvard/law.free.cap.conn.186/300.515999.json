She alleged that the defendant was under a duty to maintain the section of the road where she fell and had neglected to perform this duty properly. Upon a motion of the defendant and in reliance upon admissions and stipulations of the parties, the trial court<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> concluded that Whitney Road was not part of the \u201cstate highway system\u201d as defined in $ 13a-14 and, therefore, granted summary judgment for the defendant. The plaintiff has appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">There is no dispute about the facts relied upon by the trial court in rendering summary judgment. Whitney Road is located on the campus of the University of Connecticut at Storrs. It is one of several highways which provide access to the facilities of this state educational institution. It intersects another of these highways on the campus, Mansfield Road, which in turn intersects Route 195, a primary or secondary highway included in the \u201cstate highway system.\u201d Whitney Road itself does not appear on any official list of highways constituting the \u201cstate highway system\u201d or upon the official map of such system referred to in \u00a7 13a-16.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">It is not disputed that at the time of the accident the defendant commissioner was required to main<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>tain Whitney Road, in accordance with \u00a7 13b-30,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> pursuant to a \u201crequest of the state agency having jurisdiction over the property involved,\u201d the university administration. The statute expressly provides that this duty of maintenance includes the removal of snow. The \u201cduties and responsibilities\u201d of the defendant commissioner include the obligations imposed by this statute. General Statutes \u00a7 13b-4 (i)-<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">The plaintiff brought her suit under the authority of General Statutes \u00a7 13a-144<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> which allows a person injured \u201cthrough the neglect or default of the state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>or any of its employees by means of any defective highway... which it is the dnty of the commissioner of transportation to keep in repair\u201d to bring a civil action against the defendant commissioner. The presence of a dangerous accumulation of ice or snow unquestionably would make a highway defective within the meaning of this statute. <em>Faircloth </em>v. <em>Cox, </em>18 Conn. Sup. 499, 501 (1954). See <em>Burr </em>v. <em>Plymouth, </em>48 Conn. 460, 469 (1881). It is claimed that Whitney Road was a defective highway because of the icy condition which caused the plaintiff to fall and that the defendant had a duty to correct this condition as part of his obligation to maintain highways upon the grounds of a state institution imposed by \u00a7 13b-30.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>The defendant claims that legislative history requires that the broad language of \u00a7 13a-144 imposing liability for defective highways \u201cwhich it is the duty of the commissioner of transportation to keep in repair\u201d should be limited to state highways included in the \u201cstate highway system,\u201d as defined in \u00a7 13a-16.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The quoted clause in a slightly different form was included in the original enactment of 1915, when the state first waived its sovereign immunity to authorize a civil action against a state official for a defective highway.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> It corresponds closely to the provisions of General Statutes \u00a7 13a-149 permitting a person injured \u201cby means of a defective road ... (to) recover damages from the party bound to keep it in repair,\u201d a statute of more ancient lineage which has been the basis for impos<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>ing liability for such accidents upon \u201cany town, city, corporation or borough.\u201d The defendant argues that the virtual carry-over of the language of the earlier statute to \u00a7 13a-144 had no broader import than to create causes of action for defects in trunk line and state aid highways, which in 1915 were the only ones which the highway commissioner was bound to maintain. See Public Acts 1913, Ch. 174; see Public Acts 1907, Ch. 264. He also relies upon the title given to this enactment in the revision of 1918,* <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> \u201cDamages for injuries sustained on state highways,\u201d a designation which has remained essentially unchanged.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">We find these contentions unpersuasive. That the legislature had in mind only state highways when this statutory action was first created does not mean that when the predecessor to \u00a7 13b-30 was enacted in 1949<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> it intended to except highways upon the property of state institutions from the scope of \u00a7 13a-144. \u201cThere is a presumption that the legislature, in enacting a law, did so in view of existing relevant statutes and intended it to be read with them so as to make one consistent body of law.\u201d <em>Hurlbut </em>v. <em>Lemelin, </em>155 Conn. 68, 74, 230 A.2d 36 (1967). The breach of a duty of repair or maintenance, which the defendant concedes was imposed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>upon him by \u00a7 13b-30, at common law is a basis for liability. <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Norfolk, </em>94 Conn. 592, 596, 110 A. 62 (1920). It is difficult to understand the purpose of \u00a7 13b-30 in imposing such a duty upon the commissioner if the breach of that duty would afford no redress to persons injured as a result. Although the defendant argues that a remedy is provided by pursuing such a claim before the claims commissioner in accordance with General Statutes \u00a7 4-142, there was no such procedure available until 1959. Public Acts 1959, No. 685. This avenue, therefore, could hardly have been contemplated by the legislature as affording relief to a person injured by the breach of the obligation imposed upon the commissioner by the 1949 enactment.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">It also appears that in 1963 the language of \u00a7 13a-144, which had since 1915 defined the scope of liability created thereunder by reference to highways \u201cwhich it is the duty of the highway commissioner to keep in repair,\u201d was changed by substituting the phrase \u201cin the state highway system.\u201d Public Acts 1963, No. 226, \u00a7 144. The defendant would have us read the statute as if this modification remained in effect, although it was rescinded in 1965, leaving the statute in its present form, and the present language, \u201cby means of any defective highway . . . which it is the duty of the highway commissioner to keep in repair . . .\u201d was adopted. Public Acts 1965, No. 574, \u00a7 50. The 1963 amendment was included in a recompilation of highway laws entitled \u201cAn Act Restating the Highway Laws.\u201d Public Acts 1963, No. 226, \u00a7 144. The 1965 amendment was included in a so-called technical amendment act entitled \u201cAn Act Making Certain Corrections in the General Statutes.\u201d We are not aware of any legislative history of value in explaining the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>reasons for these statutory revisions. \u201cThe title to an Act is significant, but not controlling, in arriving at the intent of an enactment.\u201d <em>New York, N. H. &amp; H. R. Co. </em>v. <em>Orange, </em>91 Conn. 472, 479, 100 A. 25 (1917). \u201cBut if the language is clear and not subject to interpretation, titles are of less significance.\u201d <em>Algonquin Gas Transmission Co. </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>162 Conn. 50, 55, 291 A.2d 204 (1971). The contention of the defendant that the 1965 amendment simply restored the original language of the 1915 enactment, which may have been inadvertently modified in restating the highway laws in 1963, is not quite accurate, since the amendment substituted \u201cby means of any defective highway\u201d for \u201cby means of a defective road,\u201d in the earlier enactment. It did not simply undo what had been accomplished in 1963. We think that such indicia as are available point to a conscious adoption of the present form of \u00a7 13a-144 by the legislature in 1965 in order to broaden its scope, which had been significantly narrowed in 1963. This conclusion, of course, militates against the defendant\u2019s position that the statute should be construed to apply only to injuries occurring upon roads within the \u201cstate highway system\u201d as was expressly provided by the 1963 amendment. The 1965 amendment, if it is to be given any effect at all, must be deemed to have removed that limitation on the liability of the defendant commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">The defendant also relies upon an informal opinion of the attorney general<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> given in response to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>query of the highway commissioner concerning his potential liability for injuries on roads upon state institutions when the predecessor of \u00a7 13b-30 was first adopted in 1949. The response of the attorney general was that there would be no such liability because the roads were not state highways. An affidavit furnished by the defendant in support of the motion for summary judgment states that in reliance upon this opinion and its own interpretation, the department of transportation has established the practice of disallowing claims where the injury has occurred upon the road of a state institution rather than one included in the \u201cstate highway system.\u201d The opinion of the attorney general is entitled to substantial weight, but it is not binding on the court. <em>Windham Community Memorial Hospital </em>v. <em>Willimantic, </em>166 Conn. 113, 118, 348 A.2d 651 (1974). Similarly, \u201c[t]he practical interpretation of legislative acts by governmental agencies respon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>sible for their administration is a recognized aid to statutory construction.\u201d <em>State ex rel. James </em>v. <em>Rapport, </em>136 Conn. 177, 182, 69 A.2d 645 (1949). The opinion of the attorney general relied upon in setting the department policy referred to in the affidavit was issued in 1950, prior to the 1963 and 1965 amendments of \u00a7 13a-144 which we have found highly significant. The insertion in 1965 of language imposing liability for injuries sustained \u201cby means of any defective highway . . . which it is the duty of the highway commissioner to keep in repair\u201d for \u201cby means of any defective highway ... in the state highway system\u201d must be deemed an expansion of the more limited scope of the statute as revised in 1963 apparently to reflect the practice of the highway department. These subsequent legislative developments obviously were not considered when the opinion given by the attorney general and the agency practice which followed were formulated.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-4\">We conclude that none of the considerations advanced by the defendant can detract from the plain meaning of \u00a7 13a-144 that, if the commissioner of transportation has a legal duty to maintain a particular highway, he is subject to liability for injuries occurring thereon which are caused by negligence in performing that duty. Since it is clear that \u00a7 13b-30 imposed upon him the obligation to remove the snow from Whitney Road where the plaintiff fell, her suit for damages was authorized by \u00a7 13a-144 and the trial court erred in rendering summary judgment to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">The conclusion we have reached makes it unnecessary to discuss the alternative theory of liability which the plaintiff has presented, that Whitney Road is part of the \u201cstate highway system\u201d by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>virtue of General Statutes \u00a7 13a-14 (e) even though it is not included on the official map of that system referred to in General Statutes \u00a7 13a-16.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">There is error, the judgment is set aside and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b313-11\"> The right to bring a civil action upon a claim precludes its presentation to the claims commissioner.

The court, <em>Stoughton, J., </em>granted the supplemental motion, deciding that Whitney Eoad is not a state highway.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b315-7\"> \u201c[General Statutes] Sec. 13b-30. maintenance oe roads on state property.
