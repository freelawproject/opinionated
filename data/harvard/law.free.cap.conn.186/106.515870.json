The plaintiff, Margaret Conto, appealed from the issuance by the defendant zoning commission of the town of Washington of a permit authorizing conversion by the defendant Nikolaos Tsetsos of a neighboring building to a pizza restaurant.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The trial court dismissed the plaintiff\u2019s action for lack of jurisdiction, and the plaintiff appeals from that dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>The facts are not disputed. Margaret Conto owns property in the town of Washington, abutting property owned by Bertram and Clare T. Read. In June 1980, Tsetsos applied to the Washington zoning commission for a permit to use a portion of a building on the Read property as a pizza restaurant. The zoning commission approved the application in July 1980, and the following month the plaintiff brought an appeal in the Superior Court, naming as defendants the Washington zoning commission, the Washington zoning board of appeals, the Reads, and Tsetsos. The plaintiff\u2019s complaint charged that Tsetsos and the zoning commission had violated numerous town regulations and state statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">Separate motions to dismiss on the ground that the Superior Court lacked jurisdiction to hear the appeal were filed by the zoning commission on September 24, 1980, and by Tsetsos on October 27, 1980. Both motions were granted by the trial court on November 26,1980. In its memorandum of decision, the trial court ruled that since the zoning commission was acting to enforce the town zoning regulations when it approved Tsetsos\u2019 application, both state statutes and town regulations required the plaintiff to exhaust her administrative remedies by appealing the commission\u2019s decision first to the zoning board of appeals and only then, if denied relief, to the Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">The plaintiff raises three issues in her appeal to this court. First, she claims that the zoning commission was not acting to enforce zoning regulations when it issued the permit and consequently the zoning board of appeals had no jurisdiction to review that decision. Second, she claims that General Statutes $ 8-6 precludes Washington from interposing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>its own requirement of a local appeal between the commission\u2019s decision and the plaintiff\u2019s appeal to the Superior Court. Third, she claims that General Statutes \u00a7\u00a78-9 and 8-10 together give the court immediate jurisdiction to hear her appeal. We reject all three claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">The plaintiff\u2019s first stated issue in this appeal centers on the nature of the action taken by the Washington zoning commission. The plaintiff maintains that because this action differed from mere enforcement of zoning regulations, there was no basis for review by the zoning board of appeals under the relevant legislation.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-7\">A zoning commission is a protean body with the capacity to act either legislatively or administratively. General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 8-2, 8-3 ;<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Burke </em>v. <em>Board of Representatives, </em>148 Conn. 33, 38, 166 A.2d 849 (1961); <em>Florentine </em>v. <em>Darien, </em>142 Conn. 415, 431, 115 A.2d 328 (1955). Acting in its administrative capacity, a zoning commission may exercise plan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>ning and zoning functions. General Statutes \u00a7 8-4a ;<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Vose </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>171 Conn. 480, 483, 370 A.2d 1026 (1976); <em>Dooley </em>v. <em>Town Plan &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>154 Conn. 470, 472-73, 226 A.2d 509 (1967); see 1 Davis, Administrative Law Treatise (2d Ed. 1978) \u00a7 2.4, pp. 70-71. Because of the proliferation of a zoning commission\u2019s responsibilities, it is important to determine, at the outset, the capacity in which the commission is operating in a particular case. In the present proceedings, the first question before us is how to characterize the action of the commission when it granted the Tsetsos application for a zoning permit to operate a commercial establishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">The trial court concluded that, pursuant to the regulations of the town of Washington, the zoning commission was acting as an enforcement agency in this case. Town regulations provided that the zoning commission itself was required to act on zoning applications for a permitted use whenever the subject of the application was property other than a single-family residence. Washington Zoning Regulations \u00a7\u00a7 2.3.2 and 2.3.4.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The plaintiff concedes that the Tsetsos permit application required commission approval because it did not fall within <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>the exception for single-family residences. Our cases make it clear that a commission acts in an administrative capacity when its function is \u201cto determine whether the applicant\u2019s proposed use is one which satisfies the standards set forth in the regulations and the statutes.\u201d <em>Goldberg </em>v. <em>Zoning Commission, </em>173 Conn. 23, 29, 376 A.2d 385 (1977); <em>Housatonic Terminal Corporation </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Board, </em>168 Conn. 304, 307, 362 A.2d 1375 (1975); <em>Armstrong </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>158 Conn. 158, 168-69, 257 A.2d 799 (1969). It is therefore apparent that in this case we should review the commission\u2019s enforcement action as an aspect of its exercise of its administrative capacity. See Tondro, Connecticut Land Use Regulation, p. 211 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">The plaintiff seeks to rebut this characterization by denying the commission\u2019s authority to act as an enforcement agency in general and in this case in particular. As to the general argument, we find nothing in the statutes to invalidate the town\u2019s regulation that vests in the commission enforcement power over nonresidential zoning. On the contrary, General Statutes \u00a7 8-3 (e) expressly permits zoning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>commissions to \u201cprovide for the manner in which the zoning regulations shall be enforced.\u201d Although the statutes permit delegation of authority to a zoning enforcement officer; see, e.g., General Statutes \u00a7 8-3 (f), 8-lla, 8-12; 3 Rathkopf, Law of Zoning and Planning (4th Ed. 1981) \u00a7 45.01; they do not expressly or by implication require such a delegation.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Nor do we find, on this record, any basis other than the plaintiff\u2019s unsupported allegation to conclude that the commission\u2019s action involved some exercise of discretion, such as that involved in a special permit, that might take this case out of the normal enforcement pattern for permitted uses.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">The second issue that we must resolve is whether town zoning regulations could legally provide that appeals from enforcement decisions of a town zoning commission must, in the first instance, be taken to the town\u2019s zoning board of appeals. The town purported to empower its zoning board of appeals \u201c[t]o hear and decide appeals where it is alleged that there is an error in any order or decision made by the Zoning Commission or its Enforcement Officer.\u201d Washington Zoning Regulations \u00a7 18.1.1. The trial court held that this provision provided the plaintiff with an administrative remedy which she was required to exhaust before she could appeal to the Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">The plaintiff contends that \u00a7 18.1.1 is invalid because it violates the provisions of General Statutes \u00a78-6. Under \u00a78-6, \u201c[t]he zoning board of appeals shall have the following powers and duties: (1) To hear and decide appeals where it is alleged that there is an error in any order, requirement or decision made by the official charged with the enforcement of this chapter or any bylaw, ordinance or regulation adopted under the provisions of this chapter....\u201d The plaintiff maintains that the words \u201cthe official\u201d in \u00a7 8-6 preclude review by a zoning board of appeals of the action of a commission. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-7\">The reference in \u00a7 8-6 to \u201cthe official\u201d must be read in conjunction with the language of other sections of chapter 124 of the General Statutes. General Statutes \u00a7 8-8 speaks of \u201cany officer, department, board or bureau of any municipality, charged with the enforcement of any order, requirement or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>decision of said board,\u201d and G-eneral Statutes \u00a7 8-12 provides that zoning regulations \u201cshall be enforced by the officer or official board or authority designated therein . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> These statutory provisions demonstrate that the legislature has not required the towns to designate a single enforcement officer but has rather, consistently with \u00a78-3 (e), allowed the towns to choose the manner and \u201cthe official\u201d for the enforcement of zoning regulations. Read in context, \u00a7 8-6 authorizes zoning boards of appeals to review the actions of any local officer, board or commission that has been designated by local regulations to be \u201cthe official charged with the enforcement\u201d of local zoning regulations. See <em>Caulfield </em>v. <em>Noble, </em>178 Conn. 81, 93, 420 A.2d 1160 (1979); <em>Frazier </em>v. <em>Manson, </em>176 Conn. 638, 642-43, 410 A.2d 475 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">Since the \"Washington zoning board of appeals affords the plaintiff an available avenue for relief, she must, according to well established principles of zoning law, exhaust that remedy before appealing to a court of law. <em>Astarita </em>v. <em>Liquor Control Commission, </em>165 Conn. 185, 190, 332 A.2d 106 (1973); <em>Holt-Lock, Inc. </em>v. <em>Zoning &amp; Planning Commission, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>161 Conn. 182, 186, 286 A.2d 299 (1971); 4 Anderson, American Law of Zoning (2d Ed. 1977) \u00a7 25.25. There are established exceptions to this principle. A party need not exhaust an inadequate or futile administrative remedy; <em>Kosinski </em>v. <em>Lawlor, </em>177 Conn. 420, 425, 418 A.2d 66 (1979); <em>Corsino </em>v. <em>Grover, </em>148 Conn. 299, 308, 170 A.2d 267 (1961) ; further, a court will not deny access to injunctive relief when local procedures cannot \u201ceffectively, conveniently and directly determin[e] whether the plaintiffs are entitled to the relief claimed.\u201d <em>Bianco </em>v. <em>Darien, </em>157 Conn. 548, 555, 254 A.2d 898 (1969). In light of the broad powers conferred upon the Washington zoning board by the relevant regulations and statutes, none of these exemptions provides a basis for an immediate judicial hearing since the board of appeals could provide her full relief.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> This case is distinguishable from <em>Helbig </em>v. <em>Zoning Commission, </em>185 Conn. 294, 315-20, 440 A.2d 940 (1981), on which the plaintiff relies, because the plaintiff here has not alleged any constitutional defect in the regulations whose enforcement is at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">in</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">The plaintiff\u2019s final claim is that review by the zoning board of appeals is not required because General Statutes \u00a7 8-9 always permits an aggrieved party direct access to the Superior Court. That section provides, without limitation, that \u201c[ajppeals from zoning commissions and planning and zoning commissions may be taken to the superior court and, upon certification for review, to the supreme court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>in the manner provided in section 8-8.\u201d Section 8-9 is reenforced, it is argued, by \u00a7 8-10 which assigns to the provisions of \u00a7\u00a7 8-8 and 8-9 precedence over any inconsistent municipal regulations or special acts.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The effect of these sections, according to the plaintiff, is that all zoning commission decisions are always immediately reviewable by the Superior Court because the town of Washington is barred from imposing any intermediate appeal to its board of zoning appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-4\">The plaintiff\u2019s interpretation of Greneral Statutes \u00a7 8-10 mistakes both its text and the legislative purpose it embodies. Section 8-10, originally adopted in 1953, has been construed several times by this court. We have stated that when that provision \u201cis read in the light of its legislative history and policy it becomes abundantly clear that the legislative intent was to create a uniform right of appeal from every zoning board of appeals, zoning commission, planning and zoning commission or other final zoning authority in the state regardless of whether the commission was acting under the general enabling act or under the provisions of a special act. <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>Town Council, </em>143 Conn. 280, 286, 121 A.2d 630 [1956]. \u2018By adopting the provisions of \u00a78-10 the legislature evidenced its intention to make the provisions of \u00a7\u00a7 8-8 and 8-9 applicable to every municipality in the state.\u2019 <em>Puskarz </em>v. <em>Zoning. Board of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number><em>Appeals, </em>155 Conn. 360, 365, 232 A.2d 109 [1967].\u201d <em>Weigel </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>160 Conn. 239, 249, 278 A.2d 766 (1971). The uniformity intended is the availability of judicial review for all final zoning decisions, whatever the nature of the local body making them or the enabling legislation under which it acts. See Tondro, Connecticut Land Use Regulation, pp. 15-16,215 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">The statute explicitly accommodates diverse local systems by mandating application of 'H 8-8 and 8-9 to \u201cappeals from zoning boards of appeals, zoning commissions or other final zoning authority . . . .\u201d Since \u00a7 8-8 provides for appeals from boards of appeals and \u00a7 8-9 for appeals from commissions, either route satisfies the uniformity requirement of \u00a7 8-10. It is. clear that \u00a7 8-10 does not intend to prohibit local arrangements by which a commission decision may be appealed to a board of appeals, so long as review by the Superior Court is ultimately available. The plaintiff\u2019s argument would transform a statutory right to review into a statutory command that all communities adopt identical procedures. This view is in obvious conflict with the purpose of chapter 124 to establish guidelines and supervision for local zoning without mandating a uniform statewide procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">Since the zoning commission\u2019s decision to issue a use permit was an enforcement action falling under \u00a7 8-6, Washington is free to authorize an appeal of that decision to its zoning board of appeals by means of \u00a7 18.1.1.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> General Statutes \u00a7 8-10 creates no impediment to such a local enact<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>xnent. Since both General Statutes \u00a7 8-6 and Washington Zoning Regulations \u00a7 18.1.1 provide the plaintiff with an appellate step between the commission and the Superior Court, the trial court was correct in ruling that the plaintiff had failed to exhaust her administrative remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b119-11\"><em> </em>The owners of the property, Bertram and Clare Read, were also named as defendants.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b121-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 8-2 provides, in relevant part: \u201cregulations.
