Kloter, after a hearing in damages. The plaintiff is the owner of an undeveloped parcel of land on the southerly side of Route 30, also known as the Hartford Turnpike, in the town of Vernon. The defendant, Carabetta Enterprises, Inc., owns adjacent land to the east and south of the plaintiff\u2019s lot upon which it has built an apartment complex known as Sleeping Giant Apartments. The plaintiff brought this action seeking money damages and injunctive relief against the defendant. He alleged that the storm drainage system installed by the defendant when the apartments were built resulted in the flooding of his land, thereby reducing its value.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-7\">Upon the defendant\u2019s failure to comply with a court order to answer certain interrogatories and to produce certain documents as requested by the plaintiff, a default judgment was rendered in favor of the plaintiff. The case was then set down for a hearing in damages. At no time did the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>notify the plaintiff, pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 367, that it intended to contest any issue other than the amount of damages at the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">During the hearing, the defendant attempted to introduce the testimony of Richard Dimmock, a civil engineer. The defendant also attempted to introduce a development map and a topographical map of the land at issue. Upon questioning by the trial court, the defendant made an offer of proof that the substance of this evidence was that the plaintiff\u2019s damages should be limited because the plaintiff\u2019s land had been flooded prior to the construction of the apartment complex.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">The trial court refused to admit the evidence. It reasoned that the evidence controverted the allegations of paragraphs six and seven of the plaintiff\u2019s complaint.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> These paragraphs state:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-7\">\u201c6. Prom the date of completion of said apartment complex to the present the Plaintiff\u2019s land has been flooded due to the drainage of water onto the Plaintiff\u2019s land.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-8\">\u201c7. The Defendant has created said flooding situation and permitted it to exist . . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b474-9\">In excluding the maps and the testimony of Dimmock it appears that the trial court acted upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>the erroneous assumption that the defendant was endeavoring to litigate liability.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The defendant took a proper and timely exception to this ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">On the basis of the evidence admitted, the trial court denied injunctive relief, but rendered judgment in favor of the plaintiff in the amount of $18,000 with costs. From this judgment the defendant has appealed. One issue raised in the appeal is whether the trial court erred in refusing to admit into evidence the maps and Dimmock\u2019s testimony. The defendant maintains that such evidence was offered solely to contest the amount of damages suffered by the plaintiff due to the construction of the apartment complex.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">The issue dispositive of this appeal is whether the trial court erred in excluding the evidence offered by the defendant to establish the condition of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>plaintiff\u2019s property prior to the defendant\u2019s activities. We find that the trial court did err in such regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">A default in an action for legal and equitable relief admits the material facts constituting a cause of action. <em>Cardona </em>v. <em>Valentin, </em>160 Conn. 18, 26, 273 A.2d 697 (1970); <em>New York, N.H. &amp; H. R. Co. </em>v. <em>Hungerford, </em>75 Conn. 76, 78, 52 A. 487 (1902); <em>Starr Cash &amp; Package Car Co. </em>v. <em>Starr, </em>69 Conn. 440, 446, 37 A. 1057 (1897).</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">Upon default, the plaintiff ordinarily becomes entitled to recover nominal damages. <em>Cardona </em>v. <em>Valentin, </em>supra; <em>Batchelder </em>v. <em>Bartholomew, </em>44 Conn. 494, 501-502 (1877). The right to further substantial damages remains to be established by the plaintiff at a hearing in damages. <em>New York, N.H. &amp; H. R. Co. </em>v. <em>Hungerford, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-7\">After, a default,' a defendant may still contest liability at a hearing in damages, provided that he has given notice to the plaintiff of his intention to do; so. Practice Book \u00a7 367; <em>DeBlasio </em>v. <em>Aetna Life &amp; Casualty Co., </em>186 Conn. 398, 401, 441 A.2d 838 (1982); <em>Morris </em>v. <em>Winchester Repeating Arms Co., </em>73\u2019 Conn. 680, 684, 49 A. 180 (1901); <em>Ockershausen </em>v. <em>New York, N.H. &amp; H. R. Co., </em>71 Conn. 617, 621, 42 A. 650 (1899).</p>\n<p id=\"b476-8\">The defendant in the present matter, having failed to give such notice,, is. limited to contesting the amount of damages. Practice Book 367, 374. Because such notice was not given, the trial court concluded that, the defendant- was improperly contesting liability.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> However, the record' is clear that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>the defendant was attempting to implement the provisions of Practice Book \u00a7 374, which provides: \u201cThe defendant may, without notice, offer evidence to reduce the amount of damages claimed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">It is well settled in Connecticut that in assessing damages for permanent injury to real estate, the proper measure is the diminution in value. <em>Scoville </em>v. <em>Ronalter, </em>162 Conn. 67, 76, 291 A.2d 222 (1971); <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Conti, </em>149 Conn. 174, 180, 177 A.2d 670 (1962); <em>Stratford Theater, Inc. </em>v. <em>Stratford, </em>140 Conn. 422, 424, 101 A.2d 279 (1953). Such a measure of damages necessarily involves a consideration of the former value of the property. See <em>Scoville </em>v. <em>Ronalter, </em>supra, 75-76.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">By offering evidence concerning the condition of the plaintiff\u2019s land prior to the construction of the apartment complex, the defendant was attempting to present its estimate of the land\u2019s former value. To deny the defendant this opportunity would seriously curtail its right to contest the amount of damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-7\">Throughout the proceedings the defendant has admitted the plaintiff\u2019s essential allegations that the defendant\u2019s storm drainage system was installed incorrectly and that the system caused damage to the plaintiff\u2019s land. Therefore, it cannot be concluded that the defendant, by offering the disputed evidence, was attempting to controvert the essential allegations of the plaintiff\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>There is error; the judgment is set aside, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-4\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b474-10\"> In its memorandum of decision, the trial court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ADD\">\u201cNotwithstanding the foregoing rules governing hearings in damages, the defendant attempted to offer evidence to controvert the essential allegations deemed to have been admitted by the entry of the default judgment. Paragraphs 6 and 7 of the complaint allege that the plaintiff\u2019s land has been flooded \u2018from the date of completion\u2019 of the defendant\u2019s apartment complex \u2018due to the drainage of water onto the plaintiff\u2019s land,\u2019 and that such flooding was caused solely by the defendant\u2019s drainage system in that \u2018the Defendant has created said flooding situation and permitted it to exist ....\u2019\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<blockquote id=\"b475-7\"> \u201cTHE COURT: Well, let me ask you this, Mr. Gionfriddo. Do you have the complaint in front of you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-8\">\u201cATTORNEY GIONFRIDDO: Yes, I do, somewhere. Yes, I do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-9\">\u201cTHE COURT: Wouldn\u2019t you say that the issues that you are required come within the purview of Section 7 of the complaint?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-10\">\u201cATTORNEY GIONFRIDDO: No, your Honor. We are not arguing that the pipe . . . was placed there correctly. Nor will Mr. Dim-mock testify to the pipe was placed there correctly. What we are arguing is that from his analysis of the site before and after that situation caused by the drain pipe was not or has minimally or not substantially damaged Mr. Kloter\u2019s property.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-11\">\u201cI think in order for what we are talking about, an issue of money damage here .... I think Mr. Dimmoek has some expertise as to water flowage, etc., that will be useful to the Court in determining what type of damage has been done to the property. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-12\">\u201cTHE COURT: So, at this point, it doesn\u2019t appear to me, Mr. Gionfriddo, that Mr. Dimmock\u2019s testimony can\u2014in order for Mr. Dimmock\u2019s testimony to be helpful to you, he, I\u2019m sure, will have to make assumptions which are contrary to the admissions made by virtue of the default ... I will exclude the identification of the map and exclude Mr. Dimmock\u2019s testimony.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-13\">\u201cATTORNEY GIONFRIDDO: I\u2019d like to take an exception, your Honor.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b476-9\"> \u201cXHE COTJ\u00cdtTIt will be based on it. Vou see, what I\u2019m concerned' about, Mr. Gionfriddo, is this: I\u2019m eoneerbed about, you already, I believe, spent a full day on this hearing. Under the statute, as you know, there is a, there is a provision which permits you to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>challenge the allegations with respect to\u2014even in the hearing in damages, you are permitted to offer evidence to contradict certain allegations in the plaintiff\u2019s complaint if you give notice. You have not given such notice.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
