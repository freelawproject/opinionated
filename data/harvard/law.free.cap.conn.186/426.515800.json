The defendant was found guilty after a trial to a jury. His appeal raises two issues, one evidentiary and one procedural.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-7\">The jury might reasonably have found the following facts. On October 26, 1978, at about 11 p.m., two men, one armed with a shotgun, robbed the cash registers, the manager, and the patrons of a Lum\u2019s restaurant in Cheshire. The robbers wore ski masks which substantially concealed their facial features; they spoke with a Spanish accent. Only the manager was able to identify the defendant as the gunman who had committed the robbery. When the police arrived at the scene at about 11:15 p.m., they found a small wooden chip on the restaurant floor and several bills of various denominations in the parking lot outside the restaurant.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-8\">About an hour earlier, at a different restaurant in Cheshire, about five miles north of the Lum\u2019s, the defendant and his brother were observed having a drink. They left that restaurant in a white Mustang with the license plate VN 2804. Immediately after the robbery, a white Mustang was seen travelling north, at a high rate of speed, at a location between the two restaurants. The VN 2804 Mustang, which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>had been stolen the day before the robbery, was not otherwise connected with the incident at the Lum\u2019s.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> None of the witnesses at the Lima\u2019s had seen how the robbers had come or how they had fled from the scene.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">Three days after the robbery the police recovered a shotgun to which the wooden chip found on the Lum\u2019s floor belonged. The gun was recovered in another stolen car; when that car was stopped, it was not occupied by the defendant. Dusting of the gun produced no identifiable fingerprints.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-7\">The most damaging evidence directly connecting the defendant with the Lum\u2019s robbery came from Eric Colon. Colon was awaiting sentence and had been promised favorable consideration on a number of unrelated outstanding arrest warrants. He testified to one conversation before the robbery in which the defendant had said that he was planning \u201cto hit\u201d the Lum\u2019s, and to two conversations after the robbery in which the defendant had said that he had \u201chit\u201d the restaurant.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-8\">The defendant does not challenge the sufficiency of this evidence to support his conviction on all counts of the information. Instead, he maintains that the trial court erred (1) by admitting into evidence prejudicial hearsay of police radio broadcasts stating that a white Mustang was involved in the Lum\u2019s robbery and (2) by failing to inspect, in camera, a written statement given to the state by Eric Colon and by failing to have the statement in its entirety sealed and preserved as an exhibit. We will consider these claims of error separately.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>The defendant\u2019s evidentiary claim must be placed into context. At the trial, Cheshire Police Lieutenant Miran Yerner testified, without objection, that he had observed a white Mustang speeding north on Main Street as he was making his way southward to investigate the Lum\u2019s robbery. He also testified, without objection, that he had radioed to the police cars behind him to be advised of a white northbound Mustang. Thereafter, two other Cheshire police officers, Sergeant Mark Youngquist and Patrolman Stephen O\u2019Connor, who came to assist in the investigation of the robbery, were permitted to testify, over objection, that they had heard radio broadcasts about the robbery and about the white Mustang. Despite some effort to head off the white Mustang, it was not again seen by the police on the night of the robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">The defendant maintains that the officers\u2019 testimony should not have been admitted into evidence because their statements constituted hearsay about the involvement of the white Mustang. We do not agree. The defendant\u2019s objections might have had some merit had the questionable association of the car with the robbery not been put into evidence by the Verner testimony. Vemer\u2019s testimony was, as the defendant concedes, not subject to objection because he testified to what he himself had observed. The other officers merely reported what they had heard over the police radio as an explanation for their own subsequent conduct. The testimony of the other officers was not offered for the truth of the assertions made over the police radio but rather to show the effect of the broadcasts on their hearers. Such testimony is not barred by the hearsay rule. <em>State </em>v. <em>Vennard, </em>159 Conn. 385, 392, 270 A.2d 837, cert. denied, 400 U.S. 1011, 91 S. Ct. 576, 27 L. Ed. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>2d 625 (1970); see <em>United States </em>v. <em>DeVincent, </em>632 F.2d 147, 151 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 449 U.S. 986, 101 S.

Ed. 2d 106 (1979); <em>State </em>v. <em>McDowell, </em>179 Conn. 121, 123-24, 425 A.2d 935 (1979); 2 Wharton, Criminal Evidence (Torcia Ed. 1972) \u00a7274; 6 Wigmore, Evidence (Chadbonrn Ed. 1976) \u00a7 1789.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">The defendant\u2019s alternate claim of error arises out of the denial of his request to have the court review the entirety of a written statement given to the state by Eric Colon, the principal witness against the defendant. After Colon\u2019s testimony,, the defendant was provided with a small portion of the Colon statement, some seven pages out of a transcribed statement of over one hundred pages. The defendant thereupon asked for the remainder of the statement in order to be able to conduct a full cross-examination concerning Colon\u2019s self-interest in testifying on behalf of the state. The state resisted the defendant\u2019s request on the ground that the statement contained pending matters that were likely to lead to future arrests of individuals whom the state did not want forewarned. The defendant then asked the trial court to inspect the statement in camera to determine whether all of the material relevant to the present case had in fact been dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>closed. The state, in apparent agreement with this proposed procedure, responded, \u201c[t]hat\u2019s the only thing we can do is have your Honor go through the whole statement. I can show you which parts I took out of it.\u201d Nonetheless, the trial court chose not to conduct an inspection of the Colon statement, and did not order it sealed as an exhibit. The court concluded that the defendant\u2019s interests would be sufficiently protected by permitting Colon to be cross-examined concerning any other possible criminal involvement that might have influenced his testimony, and by charging the jury in cautionary language about Colon\u2019s credibility. The defendant took a timely exception to this substitute procedure. He now renews his argument that he was entitled to a judicial inspection of the whole Colon statement to determine whether it contained additional material relating to Colon\u2019s testimony in this case. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">Our rules of practice have provided discovery procedures for criminal cases since 1972.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Under the provisions of \u00a7\u00a7 752<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and 753<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> of the Practice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>Book, after a witness has testified for the state, \u201cthe judicial authority shall, on motion of the defendant, order the state to produce any statement of the witness,\u201d unless the prosecuting authority claims that the statement \u201ccontains matter which does not relate to the subject matter of the testimony of the witness . . . .\u201d In that event, \u201cthe judicial authority shall order the prosecuting authority to deliver such statement for the inspection of the judicial authority in camera.\u201d These provisions, repeatedly employing the word \u201cshall,\u201d are mandatory. \"We have held that they are available to criminal defendants as a matter of right. <em>State </em>v. <em>Villafane, </em>171 Conn. 644, 668, 372 A.2d 82, cert. denied, 429 U.S. 1106, 97 S. Ct. 1137, 51 L. Ed. 2d 558 (1976).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The judicial author<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>ity is obligated, by these provisions, to honor a defense request for inspection of the statement of a state\u2019s witness and to order the statement sealed as an exhibit if the court decides to withhold portions thereof as unrelated to the witness\u2019 testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">The state does not take issue with these principles but argues that they are inapplicable in the present case. The state\u2019s first contention is that the defendant failed to make a proper request for Colon\u2019s statement because the defendant\u2019s request did not cite the relevant sections of the Practice Book. While we can imagine circumstances where such an omission might cause confusion, the present record demonstrates no misunderstanding about what the defendant was seeking and why. Throughout the trial, the state had routinely honored defense requests for the statements of other state witnesses after they had testified. The state expressly acquiesced in the proposal for a judicial inspection, in camera, of the Colon statement. The trial court was informed that the defendant needed the Colon statement for the purpose of a full cross-examination. It premised its rejection of the defendant\u2019s request not on its uncertainty about what the defendant sought but on its acceptance of the accuracy of the representations made by the prosecuting authority. In these circumstances, it would be elevating form over substance to conclude that the defendant had not made a proper request for an in camera inspection simply because he had omitted mention of \u00a7\u00a7 752 and 753. See <em>Hill </em>v. <em>United </em>States, 401 F.2d 995, 996 (9th Cir. 1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>.The state\u2019s second contention is equally formalistic. The state maintains that the \u00a7 753 provision for an in camera inspection only comes into play after production of a statement has been ordered. The state envisages a mandatory two step process: (1) upon the defendant\u2019s motion, the judicial authority must order a statement to be produced; (2) once that order has been entered, the state may claim its right of limited nondisclosure and the judicial authority must then inspect the disputed statement in camera. The state offers no reason of policy why the rules may not be flexibly interpreted to permit the judicial authority to proceed to an in camera inspection without a prior order formally adjudicating the propriety of production of the disputed statement. A two step process may be required in some circumstances, as for example if there is a contest about whether a particular document qualifies as a statement under the terms of ^ 749 and whether therefore it needs to be produced at all. Whether there was a proper order was the issue in <em>State </em>v. <em>DellaCamera, </em>166 Conn. 557, 562-63, 353 A.2d 750 (1974), on which the state relies, for there the statutory requirement about production of statements was at the crux of the litigation. In the present case, however, the state has never denied that Colon\u2019s statement falls within the definition of \u201cstatement\u201d in \u00a7 749. The trial court\u2019s reliance on the representations of the prosecuting authority can only be understood as an implied holding that, but for the statement\u2019s allegedly extraneous contents, it would have been ordered produced for the defendant\u2019s use.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">The state next argues that the trial court substantially complied with the requirements of the Practice Book by holding a hearing and permitting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>extensive cross-examination of Colon. This argument mistakes the import of the requirement for an in camera inspection. The purpose of that inspection is to permit the court to exercise its own judgment on the question of whether a portion of the disputed statement may be suppressed because it \u201cdoes not relate to the subject matter of the testimony of the witness.\u201d It is no reflection on the good faith of prosecuting attorneys to observe that their judgment about what \u201crelates\u201d may be colored by their role in the trial process. The provision for in camera inspection is, by the express terms of \u00a7 753, mandatory. Although a hearing may well be desirable to inform the trial court about the judgment it must make, a hearing cannot displace the rule\u2019s requirement for an independent in camera inspection of the whole statement by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">Until the Colon statement is inspected by the court, the state\u2019s final argument must also fail. Whether the defendant was prejudiced by not having access to the whole Colon statement cannot be determined by speculation about what that statement contains. Nor may we speculate as to whether the jury would have convicted the defendant had the Colon testimony been stricken if the state had elected to refuse to produce the statement. This is not, on the present record, a case of harmless error.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-7\">The trial court\u2019s error in failing to inspect the whole Colon statement does not, however, require us to set aside the judgment that has been rendered. We assume that the Colon statement is still in the hands of the prosecuting authority. On that assump<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>tion, the case is remanded to the judge who presided at the trial so that he can now conduct the in camera inspection required by ^ 753.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">After inspection of the Colon statement, the trial judge must resolve one or possibly two questions. He must first determine whether any undisclosed portion of the Colon statement contains material which relates to the subject matter of Colon\u2019s direct testimony. If some portion of the statement contains material which ought to have been disclosed, he must determine whether the error was harmful because the defense was prejudiced by failing to gain access to this undisclosed material.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> A new trial must be ordered if both of these questions are answered in the affirmative; otherwise the statement must be sealed and preserved as an exhibit to enable the defendant, if he wishes, to seek further judicial review.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b448-7\">The case is remanded for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b440-9\"> The stolen ear was the basis for the count of the information charging the defendant with larceny.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b442-7\"> Possibly the officers\u2019 evidence, although not hearsay, might have been excluded because <em>of </em>its potentially prejudicial effect upon the jury. That ground was not urged upon the court below and has only been raised obliquely in this court. In any event, admission was not harmful under all of the circumstances here because the evidence given by these officers was merely cumulative of that previously and properly given by Verner. <em>State </em>v. <em>Barber, </em>173 Conn. 153, 160, 376 A.2d 1108 (1977); <em>State </em>v. <em>Jeustiniano, </em>172 Conn. 275, 283, 374 A.2d 209 (1977); <em>State </em>v. <em>Vennard, </em>159 Conn. 385, 393, 270 A.2d 837, cert. denied, 400 U.S. 1011, 91 S.
