The defendant has appealed, claiming only that the trial court\u2019s instructions to the jury on intent violated the rule of <em>Sandstrom </em>v. <em>Montana, </em>442 U.S. 510, 99 S. Ct. 2450, 61 L. Ed. 2d 39 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b274-8\">The jury could reasonably have found the following facts: On March 25,1977, the defendant entered the Beneficial Finance Office in Danbury and pointed a gun at the assistant manager. After failing to obtain any cash, the defendant fled the scene and was chased by a Danbury police officer. During an exchange of gunfire both the police officer and the defendant were wounded and the defendant was captured. The defendant admitted the attempted robbery and the fact that he had fired at the police officer, but claimed he had no intention to kill.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>The court\u2019s instructions on intent included the statement \u201c[e]very person is presumed to intend the natural consequences of his act.\u201d In <em>Sandstrom </em>v. <em>Montana, </em>supra, the United States Supreme Court held that a jury instruction that \u201c \u2018[t]he law presumes that a person intends the ordinary consequences of his voluntary acts\u2019 \u201d violated the defendant\u2019s due process rights because a reasonable jury could have interpreted the instruction as a burden-shifting presumption like that invalidated in <em>Mullaney </em>v. <em>Wilbur, </em>421 U.S. 684, 95 S. Ct. 1881, 44 L. Ed. 2d 508 (1975), or as a conclusive presumption like those invalidated in <em>United States </em>v. <em>United States Gypsum Co., </em>438 U.S. 422, 98 S. Ct. 2864, 57 L. Ed. 2d 854 (1978), and <em>Morissette </em>v. <em>United States, </em>342 U.S. 246, 72 S. Ct. 240, 96 L. Ed. 288 (1952). <em>Sandstrom </em>v. <em>Montana, </em>supra, 517-24. Although the instruction language in this case is similar to the instruction found erroneous in <em>Sandstrom </em>v. <em>Montana, </em>supra, the rule of <em>Sandstrom </em>may not be oversimplified. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Arroyo, </em>180 Conn. 171, 175, 429 A.2d 457 (1980). <em>Sandstrom </em>does not invalidate, for example, an \u201c \u2018entirely permissive inference or presumption, which allows\u2014but does not require\u2014the trier of fact to infer the elemental fact from proof by the prosecutor of the basic one and that places no burden of any kind on the defendant.\u2019 <em>Ulster County Court </em>[v. <em>Allen, </em>442 U.S. 140, 157, 99 S. Ct. 2213, 60 L. Ed. 2d 777 (1979)].\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Arroyo, </em>supra, 175. The use of the word \u201cpresume\u201d does not itself render an instruction invalid; <em>State </em>v. <em>Arroyo, </em>supra, 175; rather it is the \u201clack of qualifying instructions as to the legal effect of the presumption,\u201d making it possible for a reasonable jury to interpret the use of the word \u201cpresume\u201d in an unconstitutional manner. <em>Sandstrom </em>v. <em>Montana, </em>supra, 517.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>On many occasions this court has found no error in instructions containing language similar to that invalidated in <em>Sandstrombe </em>cause the challenged instructions contained other language not present in the <em>Sandstrom </em>instructions which was sufficiently precise or elaborate to prevent the jury from applying the instructions in an unconstitutional manner. <em>State </em>v. <em>Stankowski, </em>184 Conn. 121, 148-53, 439 A.2d 918, cert. denied, 454 U.S. 1052, 102 S. Ct. 596, <em>70 L. </em>Ed. 2d 588 (1981); <em>State </em>v. <em>Brokaw, </em>183 Conn. 29, 34, 438 A.2d 815 (1981); <em>State </em>v. <em>Truppi, </em>182 Conn. 449, 452-59, 438 A.2d 713 (1980), cert. denied, 451 U.S. 941, 101 S. Ct. 2024, 68 L. Ed. 2d 329 (1981); <em>State </em>v. <em>Nemeth, </em>182 Conn. 403, 411, 438 A.2d 120 (1980); <em>State </em>v. <em>Vasquez, </em>182 Conn. 242, 249-53, 438 A.2d 424 (1980); <em>State </em>v. <em>Maselli, </em>182 Conn. 66, 75-78, 437 A.2d 836 (1980), cert. denied, 449 U.S. 1083, 101 S. Ct. 868, 66 L. Ed. 2d 807 (1981); <em>State </em>v. <em>Perez, </em>181 Conn. 299, 311-16, 435 A.2d 334 (1980); <em>State </em>v. <em>Arroyo, </em>180 Conn. 171, 173-81, 429 A.2d 457 (1980). The instructions in this case contained the same type of elaborate and precise language which .cured the otherwise ambiguous use of \u201cpresume\u201d and prevented the jury from applying the instructions in an unconstitutional manner.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">There is no error.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b276-6\"> The court\u2019s instructions on intent included the following: \u201cNow, ladies and gentlemen, in both of the crimes alleged here, that is attempted robbery and attempted murder, the statutes require intent. So, I am giving to you some instructions with regard to intent. It is a mental process. \u2022 A person\u2019s intention <em>may he inferred from his conduct. </em>Every person is presumed to intend the natural consequences of his act. It is often impossible and never necessary to prove criminal.intent by direct evidence. Ordinarily, intent can be proved only by circumstantial evidence. What \u00e1 person\u2019s purpose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>or intention has been <em>is necessarily very largely a matter of inference. </em>No person can be expected to come in here and testify that he looked into another person\u2019s mind and saw therein a certain purpose or intention. The only way in which a jury can determine what a person\u2019s purpose or intention was at any given moment, aside from that person\u2019s own testimony, is by determining what the circumstances were surrounding that conduct and from those <em>infer what his pv/rpose or intention was. </em>To draw such an <em>inference </em>is not only the privilege of the jury, but it is also your duty provided, of course, <em>the inference drawn is a reasonable one. </em>In this ease therefore it would be part of your duty to draw <em>all reasonable inferences </em>from the conduct of the aeeused in the light of the surrounding eixeumstanees <em>as to what purpose or intention was in his mind at various times.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
