Healey, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AMY\">This is an action for injunctive relief brought by the plaintiffs seeking to enjoin the defendant, town of Fairfield, from \u201ctrespassing upon or otherwise using\u201d beach property allegedly owned by the plaintiffs.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The plaintiffs, Charles F. Roche III, Nancy Roche and Michael Trotta, are owners of two separate parcels of land, presently physically bounded on the south by Long Island Sound, in Fairfield (see plaintiffs\u2019 exhibit set out in appendix to opinion). The plaintiffs have appealed from a judgment for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-9\">For many years prior to 1930, the plaintiffs\u2019 properties were bounded southerly by Pine Creek, a navigable estuary of Long Island Sound. The creek was separated from the Sound by a sand spit or peninsula which ran parallel to the shore and extended as far as the plaintiffs\u2019 properties.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The spit acted as a barrier protecting the mainland shore from the Sound.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>Both plaintiffs\u2019 premises are portions of a six-acre tract of land which a common predecessor in title received in 1896 and which tract was described as being bounded on the south by Long Island Sound. This tract was later subdivided into smaller parcels, two of which the plaintiffs presently own. Trotta received title to his premises in 1947 in a deed which described his property as bounded on the south by Pine Creek. The Roches received title to their premises<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> in 1976 in a deed which also described their property as bounded on the south by Pine Creek.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">In 1938, a storm washed away the westerly end of the sand spit which existed south of Pine Creek and which was the southerly boundary of that creek, and which spit had as its southerly boundary Long Island Sound. In 1950, another storm further destroyed another portion of the sand spit leaving an island, and another storm in 1955 destroyed the remaining portion of the sand spit which was located in front of the plaintiffs\u2019 premises. As of 1960, the sand spit, as it had existed in front of the plaintiffs\u2019 properties, was completely destroyed so that the plaintiffs\u2019 properties fronted directly on Long Island Sound. The sand spit, which had previously defined the boundaries of Pine Creek, had been completely inundated to a point east of the plaintiffs\u2019 properties leaving only a sandbar which appeared at low tide.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-7\">Between the 1955 storm and the mid-1960s, sand accumulated so that the beach in front of the plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>tiffs\u2019 properties grew to some 200 feet. This beach extended to Long Island Sound over what had formerly been the bed of Pine Creek. In 1967, the town obtained easements<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> from the affected property owners, including the Roches (but not Trotta), for the construction of a dike as part of a flood control project. The dike was located substantially in the center of what had formerly been Pine Creek. The title to the beach area between the plaintiffs\u2019 original southerly boundary and the Sound is the subject of the present dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">Since 1959, the town, through its recreation commission, has maintained a lifeguard station at a public beach called South Pine Creek Beach which includes the 200 feet of beach area in front of the plaintiffs\u2019 properties<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and extends to a wooden bulkhead located east of the plaintiffs\u2019 properties. The public beach was operated every day from Memorial Day to Labor Day and on weekends in September of each year. The lifeguards would patrol the beach area daily and their duties included safeguarding bathers, giving swimming lessons and prohibiting fishing, dogs and alcoholic beverages from the premises. The area patrolled included the beach in front of the plaintiffs\u2019 premises up to a wooden bulkhead east of their properties. The parks department has regularly cleaned the beach area once or twice a week during the summer months since 1959.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-7\">In the fall of 1976, Roche placed stones, as markers, along his easterly boundary line to the high-water mark of Long Island Sound. The town, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>in 1977, removed some of the stones and Roche, threatened with arrest, removed the rest of the stones. Roche, claiming ownership of the beach area in front of his property, wrote to the first selectman and the department of public works advising them to keep off his land and that he did not need their assistance in maintaining his property.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">The plaintiffs brought this action for injunctive relief and damages for trespass on the land in front of their properties maintaining that their title extends to the high-water mark of Long Island Sound by virtue of the doctrine of accretion. The defendant denied the plaintiffs\u2019 title by accretion and raised the alternative special defenses of adverse possession, prescriptive easement and implied dedication. The trial referee held that an avulsion, and not accretion, had occurred and that the plaintiffs had failed to prove their title to the area in dispute. The referee also found that even if the disputed land did belong to the plaintiffs, the defendant would have obtained either title to the land by adverse possession or a right of way to use the land by prescriptive easement.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b506-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b506-8\">The plaintiffs\u2019 first claim is that the referee erred in finding that the beach area in dispute in front of the plaintiffs\u2019 property was created by an avulsion rather than by accretion. We agree. \u201cOn appeal, it is the function of this court to determine whether the decision of the trial court is clearly erroneous. See Practice Book, 1978, $ 3060D. This involves a two part function: where the legal conclusions of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>the court are challenged, we must determine whether they are legally and logically correct and whether they find support in the facts set out in the memorandum of decision; where the factual basis of the court\u2019s decision is challenged we must determine whether the facts set out in the memorandum of decision are supported by the evidence or whether, in light of the evidence and the pleadings in the whole record, those facts are clearly erroneous.\u201d (Footnote omitted.) <em>Pandolphe\u2019s Auto Parts, </em>Inc. v. <em>Manchester, </em>181 Conn. 217, 221-22, 435 A.2d 24 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">Accretion is defined as \u201c[addition of portions of soil, by gradual deposition through the operation of natural causes, to that already in possession of the owner.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (5th Ed.); see 5 Powell, Real Property (1981) If 719; 5A Thompson, Real Property (1970 Sup.) \u00a742560-2564. Avulsion is defined as \u201c[a] sudden and perceptible loss or addition to land by the action of water, or a sudden change in the bed or course of a stream .... The removal of a considerable quantity of soil from the land of one man, and its deposit upon or annexation to the land of another, suddenly and by the perceptible action of water.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (5th Ed.); see 5 Powell, Real Property (1981) 1\u00cd719.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-7\">\u201c[T]he owner of waterfront property is benefited in title by whatever may be joined to his land, above the high-water mark, through accretion. <em>Rochester </em>v. <em>Barney, </em>117 Conn. 462, 468, 169 A. 45 [1933].\u201d <em>Short Beach Cottage Owners Improvement Assn. </em>v. <em>Stratford, </em>154 Conn. 194, 200, 224 A.2d 532 (1966); see <em>Welles </em>v. <em>Bailey, </em>55 Conn. 292, 316, 10 A. 565 (1887); see also <em>Lockwood </em>v. <em>New York &amp; New </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number><em>Haven R. Co., </em>37 Conn. 387, 391 (1870). Where a change occurs suddenly and perceptibly by avulsion, however, boundaries and title to land are not affected. 78 Am. Jur. 2d, Waters \u00a7 411; see <em>Missouri </em>v. <em>Nebraska, </em>196 U.S. 23, 35, 255 S. Ct. 155, 49 L. Ed. 372 (1904). The trial referee found that \u201c[t]he evidence clearly indicates that the sand spit in front of their properties was destroyed by three storms occurring in 1938, 1950 and 1955, and that the changes were a sudden and perceptible loss of the spit resulting immediately from the storms .... The changes of the northerly bound of the Sound occurred on the days of each storm and were complete on those days, portions of Pine Creek disappeared instantly on those days and the shore line of the Sound suddenly and perceptibly became the shore line as it presently exists, during the storms. What had been Pine Creek suddenly and perceptibly became Long Island Sound. WTiat occurred in the present ease constituted an avulsion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">While this finding adequately deals with the title and boundaries to the sand spit, it sheds no real light on the status of the title to that portion of the beach area in front of the plaintiffs\u2019 properties. There was no evidence that this disputed beach area itself was created by an avulsion. There was also no evidence, even though the defendant seems to claim otherwise, that the disputed beach area was, in reality, the first submerged, now reemerged sand spit.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> It does appear, however, that there was sufficient evidence presented at the trial to establish, by a preponderance of the evidence, the plaintiffs\u2019 title to the disputed beach area by accretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>Margaret Raso, Trotta\u2019s daughter, testified that after the 1950 hurricane, the beach area directly in front of the plaintiffs\u2019 properties (or their predecessors) gradually increased over the years due to the shifting of sand caused by the currents. George Chicos, a local resident and former town employee, also testified that the disputed beach area gradually built up with sand and filled in what was once Pine Creek. Frank Daniels, engineer for the town of Fairfield, testified that the beach area in dispute gradually built up with sand, over the years from 1950 to 1970, due to the action of the tides and winds. The testimony of those three witnesses on the subject of accretion was uncontroverted.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">Therefore, the trial referee\u2019s determination that the disputed beach area was created by an avulsion was clearly erroneous. See <em>Hall </em>v. <em>Planning Commission, </em>181 Conn. 442, 435 A.2d 975 (1980). It was the gradual and imperceptible actions of the Sound over the years from 1950 to 1970 which formed the beach area in front of the plaintiffs\u2019 properties and not a sudden and perceptible loss or addition to the land by the action of the water. Since the plaintiffs\u2019 southerly boundary line was extended by the doctrine of accretion, the plaintiffs held title to the beach area in dispute to the high-water mark of the Sound. <em>Short Beach Cottage Owners Improvement Assn. </em>v. <em>Stratford, </em>supra, 200; <em>Rochester </em>v. <em>Barney, </em>supra, 468.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b509-8\">Since we have found that the disputed beach area was owned by the plaintiffs, we will now consider the defendant\u2019s first special defense which is title by adverse possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>The trial referee found that the defendant did obtain title by adverse possession to the disputed beach area \u201cin that the owners were ousted of possession uninterruptedly for more than fifteen years by an open, visible and exclusive possession of the Town under a claim of right and without consent or because of the owner.\u201d The plaintiffs have claimed that the referee erred in holding as it did on the grounds that (1) adverse possession requires more than a showing of occasional, unorganized, and nonexclusive use by the general public and (2) the defendant\u2019s actions, if upheld, constitute an unlawful taking of private property without compensation and due process of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">\u201cWhere title is claimed by adverse possession, the burden of proof is on the claimant. <em>Loewenberg </em>v. <em>Wallace, </em>147 Conn. 689, 699, 166 A.2d 150 (1960). The essential elements of adverse possession are that the owner shall be ousted from possession and kept out uninterruptedly for fifteen years under a claim of right by an open, visible and exclusive possession of the claimant without license or consent of the owner. <em>Stevens </em>v. <em>Smoker, </em>84 Conn. 569, 574, 80 A. 788 (1911). The use is not exclusive if the adverse user merely shares dominion over the property with other users. <em>Short Beach Cottage Owners Improvement Assn. </em>v. <em>Stratford, </em>154 Conn. 194, 199, 224 A.2d 532 (1966). Such a possession is not to be made out by inference, but by clear and positive proof. <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>Myers, </em>156 Conn. 510, 517, 244 A.2d 385 (1968). In the final analysis, whether possession is adverse is a question of fact for the trier. <em>Padula </em>v. <em>Padula, </em>138 Conn. 102, 110, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>82 A.2d 362 (1951).\u201d <em>Whitney </em>v. <em>Turmel, </em>180 Conn. 147, 148, 429 A.2d 826 (1980). \u201cThe doctrine of adverse possession is to he taken strictly.\u201d <em>Huntington </em>v. <em>Whaley, </em>29 Conn. 391, 398 (1860).</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">The plaintiffs\u2019 claim that the defendant\u2019s assertion of title by adverse possession must fail because the trial testimony demonstrated use of the disputed beach area only by the unorganized public. They allege that under <em>Mihalczo </em>v. <em>Woodmont, </em>175 Conn. 535, 400 A.2d 270 (1978), this type of use is insufficient to establish the defendant\u2019s title. In <em>Mihalcso, </em>supra, members of the general public used the owners\u2019 seawall, which was adjacent to a beach, for a walkway. The borough of Woodmont claimed, among other things, a prescriptive easement over the walkway. We ruled that the borough itself could not, in that particular case, satisfy the requirements for such an easement because it could not show that it held title under a claim of right. That is not the situation in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">The trial referee found that this \u201cwas an organized, planned use by the Town itself, designed for the recreational activities of those members of the public who saw fit to use it.\u201d In their brief the plaintiffs argue that \u201c[t]he only use established by the testimony taking place in the disputed area is the periodic cleaning and unorganized sunbathing and swimming of the general public.\u201d We have recognized that the unorganized public cannot acquire rights by prescription. A deed to the unorganized public by that name would be void for uncertainty as there can be no prescription where there can be no grant. <em>Michalczo </em>v. <em>Woodmont, </em>supra, 541; see <em>Turner </em>v. <em>Selectmen of Hebron, </em>61 Conn. 175, 187, 22 A. 951 (1891); <em>Claudio </em>v. <em>Village</em></p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number><em>of Greenport, </em>55 Misc. 2d 371, 376, 284 N.Y.S.2d 965 (1967). The adverse user here, however, is not asserted by the unorganized public but by and through the defendant, as disclosed by the evidence. Cf. <em>B. W. &amp; Leo Harris Co. </em>v. <em>Hastings, </em>240 Minn. 44, 59 N.W.2d 813 (1953).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> \u201cA municipality, like an individual, may acquire title by adverse possession, where the elements necessary for the establishment of such a right are present, and when the adverse possession may be deemed to be the official act of the municipal corporation.\u201d 10 McQuillin, Municipal-Corporations (3d Ed.) \u00a728.15, p. 36.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> \u201cClearly, title by adverse possession may be acquired by the United States, or by a state, a county, city or other governmental entity.\u201d 3 Am. Jur. 2d, Adverse Possession \u00a7 139; see <em>Nearing </em>v. <em>Bridgeport, </em>137 Conn. 205, 75 A.2d 505 (1950); annot, 18 A.L.R. 3d 678.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">The defendant maintained this area as a public beach from Memorial Day to Labor Day and also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>on weekends in September.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The referee also stated that \u201c[u]ntil Labor Day it maintained, on a daily basis, a rest room at the westerly end of the beach area, at the southerly end of the public street, and kept two lifeguards in attendance from Memorial Day to Labor Day and week-ends until the end of September. The lifeguards supervised bathers, gave swimming lessons and performed all the usual activities of personnel so employed, and the Town cleaned the beach area once or twice a week, first by hand and later mechanically as well as by hand. The evidence shows that the Board of Recreation, at its meeting of February 9, 1959, took action to add another lifeguard at South Pine Creek Beach, and that the Park Commission and the Recreation Commission at their meetings had taken action to maintain the area as a public beach.\u201d It is clear that this was not merely use by the unorganized public but a well organized activity conducted by and through the defendant and was sufficient to allow for the assertion of a claim of title by adverse possession. See <em>Talbot </em>v. <em>Little Compton, </em>52 R.I. 280, 160 A. 466 (1932).</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>The plaintiffs also claim that the defendant\u2019s use of the beach property was not \u201cexclusive\u201d because the plaintiffs themselves used the beach during the time it was allegedly adversely possessed. We do not agree. \u201cIn general, exclusive possession can be established \u2018by acts, which at the time, considering the state of the land, comport with ownership; viz., such acts as would ordinarily be exercised by an owner in appropriating land to his own use and the exclusion of others.\u2019 <em>Family Land &amp; Investment Co., Inc. </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>273 Ala. 273, 278, 138 So. 2d 696, 699 (1961). Thus, \u2018the claimant\u2019s possession need not be absolutely exclusive; it need only be a type of possession which would characterize an owner\u2019s use.\u2019 <em>Norgard </em>v. <em>Busher, </em>220 Or. 297, 308, 349 P.2d 490, 496 (I960).\u201d <em>Lyons </em>v. <em>Andrews, </em>226 Pa. Super. 351, 357-58, 313 A.2d 313 (1973); see <em>Nelson </em>v. <em>Vandemarr, </em>281 Or. 65, 74, 573 P.2d 1232 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">The defendant, in this case, was possessing the disputed beach area in a manner that an owner of a public beach would ordinarily follow. That the plaintiffs themselves used this beach area would not negate the exclusive use of the defendant since it did not alter the plaintiffs\u2019 knowledge or notice of the adverse claim, nor did it amount to an acknowledgement of the plaintiffs\u2019 title to the land.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> See <em>Hinds </em>v. <em>Slack, </em>293 Ala. 25, 29-30, 299 So. 2d 717 (1974); <em>Walker </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>509 S.W.2d 102, 106 (Mo. 1974); <em>Porter </em>v. <em>Posey, </em>592 S.W.2d 844, 851 (Mo. App. 1979); <em>Almond </em>v. <em>Anderegg, </em>276 Or. 1041, 1045-46, 557 P.2d 220 (1976); <em>Lyons </em>v. <em>Andrews, </em>supra, 357-58. \u201c \u2018It is sufficient if the acts of ownership are of such a character as to openly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>and publicly indicate an assumed control or use such as is consistent with the character of the premises in question.\u2019\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Pulcifer </em>v. <em>Bishop, </em>246 Mich. 579, 584, 225 N.W. 3 (1929). Since the defendant was operating the disputed area as a public beach, it certainly would have been inappropriate to exclude the plaintiffs from using it. In fact, there was no evidence presented from which the court could reasonably conclude that the plaintiffs used the beach area in any other capacity than as members of the general public. The first claim of ownership which either of the plaintiffs asserted was in 1976 when Roche blocked passage to the beach area from east to west and wrote letters of protest to the first selectman and the department of public works. Those acts came too late since the defendant had commenced its possession in 1959 and obtained title by adverse possession in 1974.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">The plaintiffs additionally attack the defendant\u2019s title by adverse possession by pointing out that the defendant, in 1967, impliedly recognized the plaintiffs\u2019 superior title to the disputed area when it secured easements across the properties in order to construct the dike. The referee held that the defendant \u201csimply was insuring that they [sic] would not be trespassers, or that in the event of going on the plaintiffs\u2019 land, even temporarily, they would not be considered as encroaching.\u201d The referee stated that this was in recognition of the fact that the dike was constructed along the center line of Pine Creek, as it formerly existed, and could have, therefore, been built partially on the plaintiffs\u2019 land, inasmuch as they would own to the center of Pine Creek.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>We must agree \u25a0with the trial referee. Upon reviewing the easement,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> we conclude that it merely recognized the fact that the plaintiffs owned the land north of where Pine Creek formerly existed and that, in constructing the dike, it might have been necessary to enter upon their properties. This did not impliedly recognize the plaintiffs\u2019 title to the disputed beach area which was located to the south of the proposed dike and which extended to the Sound. There was not recognition of a superior title in the plaintiffs to the disputed area.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">Finally, the plaintiffs have claimed that the defendant\u2019s assertion of title by adverse possession <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>violates article first, \u00a7 11 o\u00a3 the state constitution which provides: \u201cThe property of no person shall be taken for public use, without just compensation therefor.\u201d This claim was raised for the first time on appeal.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> \u201cThe general rule against considering claims not raised at trial, Practice Book \u00a7 3063, applies also to constitutional issues. <em>New Haven Savings Bank </em>v. <em>Valley Investors, </em>174 Conn. 77, 84, 384 A.2d 321 (1977); <em>Mechanics Savings Bank </em>v. <em>Tucker, </em>178 Conn. 640, 425 A.2d 124 (1979); \u2018[o]nly in most exceptional circumstances can and will this court consider a claim, constitutional or otherwise, that has not been raised and decided in the trial court.\u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>165 Conn. 61, 69, 327 A.2d 576 (1973).\u201d <em>Burritt Mutual Savings Bank of New Britain </em>v. <em>Tucker, </em>183 Conn. 369, 377, 439 A.2d 396 (1981). The plaintiffs have not demonstrated this to be such an \u201cexceptional circumstance\u201d and, therefore, we do not reach this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\"
