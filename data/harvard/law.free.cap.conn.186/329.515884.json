Raveis &amp; Associates, Inc. against the defendants June M. Kimball, James G. Kimball and The Kim-ball Group, Inc. The defendants\u2019 appeal attacks the trial court\u2019s conclusion that there was probable cause to sustain the order gamisheeing debts owed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>to the defendants by the named garnishees, John R. McGrail, Carole B. McGrail, Charles T. Stnrgess, Stnrgess &amp; Company, Inc., and Tidelands Associates.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">The plaintiff\u2019s complaint charged that the defendants had tortionsly and in breach of their fiduciary obligations interfered With the plaintiff\u2019s contractual relationship with Tidelands Associates, a partnership developing a condominium project in Branford. In its affidavit in support of its request for a prejudgment remedy pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-278C<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and in documents and testimony presented at the probable cause hearing held pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-278d,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>presented evidence in support of the following facts. The defendants James (1. Kimball and June M. Kimball were employees of the plaintiff agency during the formative stages of the Tidelands condominium project. A marketing proposal for Tidelands was prepared by the plaintiff in the fall of 1979. In March 1980, a public offering statement was prepared by the owners of the Tidelands condominium property. That public offering statement contained a letter to the Tidelands tenants, on the plaintiff\u2019s stationery, advising them of the owners\u2019 intent to create a condominium conversion in accordance with General Statutes \u00a7 47-88b, and of the availability of James and June Kimball to discuss the tenants\u2019 options. All through the late fall and the early spring, John R. MeGrail, who ultimately took over the condominium conversion from Charles T. Sturgess, dealt with the Kimballs as agents for the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>James and June Kimball terminated their relationship with the plaintiff on or about April 8,1980. On April 11,1980, they formed the defendant corporation, The Kimball Group, Inc., of which they are the sole shareholders. On April 14,1980, they transferred their real estate licenses to that corporation. On the same day, James Kimball, acting as agent for The Kimball Group, Inc., procured a listing agreement for the condominium project from Tidelands Associates. As late as April 8, 1980, June Kimball had briefed a group of the plaintiff\u2019s other employees about the selling prospects for the Tidelands conversion.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">On this showing, the trial court concluded that there was probable validity to the plaintiff\u2019s claim and granted its application for a prejudgment remedy. The defendants have raised four claims of error. They argue that (1) there was insufficient probable cause for any prejudgment order; (2) there was insufficient probable cause against the corporate defendant, The Kimball Group, Inc.; (3) the garnishment order improperly included future real estate commissions; and (4) there was insufficient evidence to support the amount of the garnishment order.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">We can usefully consider the first two claims of error together, because each questions the sufficiency of the evidence offered to support the prejudgment remedy. As the parties concede, the standard by which this evidence is to be tested is not the same as that which governs a trial on the merits. In order to obtain a prejudgment remedy, an applicant need only show the probable validity of his cause of action. General Statutes \u00a7 52-278d (a); <em>Augeri </em>v. <em>C. F. Wooding </em>Co., 173 Conn. 426, 428, 378 A.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>538 (1977); <em>Ledgebrook Condominium, Assn., Inc. </em>v. <em>Lusk Corporation, </em>172 Conn. 577, 583, 376 A.2d 60 (1977). The trial court, at the hearing on an application for a prejudgment remedy, must weigh the plaintiff\u2019s affidavit and the oral testimony and the documentary proof submitted by both parties. As we held in <em>Augeri </em>(p. 429) \u201c[i]n reaching its determination of probable success on the merits it is essentially weighing probabilities, and in this it must have a broad discretion. In the absence of clear error, this court should not overrule the thoughtful decision of the trial court, which has had an opportunity to assess the legal issues which may be raised and to weigh the credibility of at least some of the witnesses.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b345-4\">Applying that standard to this case, we cannot find clear error in the conclusion that there was probable validity to the claim that the defendants had wrongfully interfered with a contractual relationship between the plaintiff and the owners of Tidelands. Until April 1980, the individual defendants clearly had been pursuing this project as the plaintiff\u2019s agents. Almost immediately upon terminating their relationship with the plaintiff, the defendants procured for their own newly formed corporation the listing agreement which the plaintiff had been expecting to obtain. The prior contractual relationship between the plaintiff and the owners of Tidelands was demonstrated by the evidence concerning the Tidelands marketing proposal and its public offering statement. The defendant corporation in whose behalf the sought-after listing contract was procured by James Kimball as agent cannot avoid imputation to it of his undisputed knowledge of all the prior proceedings. <em>West Haven </em>v. <em>United States Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Co., </em>174 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>Conn. 392, 395, 389 A.2d 741 (1978); <em>Reardon </em>v. <em>Mutual Life Ins. Co., </em>138 Conn. 510, 516, 86 A.2d 570 (1952).</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">The defendants\u2019 third claim of error challenges the order of garnishment on an entirely different ground. The defendants claim that the order issued by the trial court allows the plaintiff to reach debts not yet due and owing, namely the real estate commissions to be paid at some future time under the challenged listing contract. Such future debts, the defendants argue, are beyond the reach of garnishment. Since the plaintiff introduced no evidence of any other indebtedness of the garnishees to the defendants, there were no gamishable debts and the garnishment order was, according to the defendants, improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">A hearing on a prejudgment remedy application under \u00a7 52-278d is not the occasion to test the plaintiff\u2019s rights against the garnishees. The order by the trial court garnisheed whatever debts were due the defendants from the garnishees as of the date of the garnishment. General Statutes \u00a7 52-329 ;<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Dorr-</em></p>\n<p id=\"b347-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number><em>Oliver </em>v. <em>Willett Associates, </em>153 Conn. 588, 595, 219 A.2d 718 (1966). The extent of that seizure, the determination of what debts, if any, were then owed to the defendants, must await either a scire facias hearing under General Statutes \u00a7 52-381 ;<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Clime </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number><em>Gregor, </em>145 Conn. 74, 76-77, 138 A.2d 794 (1958); or a declaratory judgment under General Statutes \u00a7 52-235a. Practice Book \u00a7 394.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The hearing authorized by \u00a7 52-278d is expressly \u201climited to a determination of whether or not there is probable cause to sustain the validity of the plaintiff\u2019s claim.\u201d The \u201cclaim\u201d to which the section refers is the plaintiff\u2019s claim against the defendants, not the plaintiff\u2019s claim against the garnishees. Any other interpretation of the section would be inconsistent with the Prejudgment Remedies Act\u2019s repeated insistence upon expeditious resolution of contested prejudgment remedy orders. See General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 52-278d, 52-278e, 52-278l (b); <em>City National Bank </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>181 Conn. 42, 46, 434 A.2d 310 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">The defendants\u2019 fourth and final claim of error asserts that the trial court had insufficient evidence before it to warrant its entry of a prejudgment remedy in the amount of $60,000. The plaintiff\u2019s application for a prejudgment remedy and the affidavit attached thereto claimed a loss of real .estate commissions in the sum of $125,000. Without formal explanation, the trial court reduced this sum to $60,000, presumably because at the hearing William Raveis himself conceded that the plaintiff would have had to share its commissions with the Kimballs as procuring agents even if the plaintiff had received the disputed listing contract. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>defendants now argue that other expenses of servicing the listing contract would necessarily have further reduced the amount that the plaintiff could have expected to earn from the Tidelands project. Unlike the evidence in <em>Essex Group </em>v. <em>Ducci Electric Co., Inc., </em>181 Conn. 524, 525-26, 436 A.2d 16 (1980), the evidence adduced at the hearing in this case was not so clear, either in kind or in amount, as to require us to find an abuse of discretion in the trial court\u2019s order of garnishment in the amount of $60,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b342-6\"> General Statutes \u00a7 52-278e provides, in relevant part: \u201cdocuments REQUIRED.
