J.</author>\n<p id=\"Avq\">The defendants appeal from a decision of the trial court finding them in contempt for violation of a prejudgment remedy order issued by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">The defendants entered into a retail installment contract and security agreement with the plaintiff for the purchase of a Baldwin piano. On the defendants\u2019 default in their payments, the plaintiff declared the balance of the price immediately due in accordance with the default clause in the contract. When the defendants failed to pay, the plaintiff applied for a prejudgment remedy to replevy the piano. The court granted the application. The sheriff attempted to replevy the piano, but, as he attested, \u201cthe defendant Gladys Blake, who has possession of said piano, would not let me in the house to replevy such piano. Therefore, I return this Order of Replevin unserved and unsatisfied.\u201d The record does not show whether the sheriff also attempted to serve the writ, summons and complaint. It is clear, however, that the writ, summons, and complaint have never been served.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">The plaintiff filed a motion for contempt, alleging that the defendants \u201cviolated and disobeyed the Order for Prejudgment Remedy in that they refused to allow a duly authorized sheriff to enter the premises wherein said piano has been wrongfully detained by the defendants, for the purpose of retaking same on behalf of the plaintiff.\u201d The plaintiff filed a rule to show cause why the defendants should not be adjudged in contempt of court for having \u201cviolated and disobeyed the Order for Prejudgment Remedy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b309-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>The defendants moved to dismiss the prejudgment remedy under General Statutes \u00a7 52-278j,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in that more than ninety days from the issuance of the replevy order had passed without service of the writ, summons, and complaint. They then filed claims of law raising again the jurisdictional issue of their motion to dismiss the replevy order for lack of service within the ninety-day period required by General Statutes \u00a7 52-278j. In response to the rule to show cause the defendants again \u201cspecifically [brought] the court\u2019s attention to defendants\u2019 claim of lack of jurisdiction . . . .\u201d At the hearing on the plaintiff\u2019s motion for contempt and rule to show cause the defendants raised the issue yet again.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">The trial court did not address the defendants\u2019 repeated jurisdictional challenges, but concluded: \u201cthe defendants may be held in contempt for violation of the prejudgment remedy order of this court.\u201d From that finding of contempt the defendants have appealed to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">At the outset this court is confronted with a challenge to the jurisdiction of the Superior Court to hear the plaintiff\u2019s motion for contempt. \u201cWhenever the absence of jurisdiction is brought to the notice of the court or tribunal, cognizance of it must be taken and the matter passed upon before it \u2018can move one further step in the cause; as any movement is necessarily the exercise of jurisdiction.\u2019 <em>Rhode Island </em>v. <em>Massachusetts, </em>12 Pet. (37 U.S.) 657, 717 [1838]; <em>Denton </em>v. <em>Danbury, </em>48 Conn. 368, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>372 [1880].\u201d <em>Woodmont </em>Assn. v. <em>Milford, </em>85 Conn. 517, 524, 84 A. 307 (1912). The point has been frequently made. See, e.g., <em>Kohn Display &amp; Woodworking Co. </em>v. <em>Paragon Paint &amp; Varnish Corporation, </em>166 Conn. 446, 448, 352 A.2d 301 (1974); <em>East Side Civic Assn. </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, 161 </em>Conn. 558, 559, 290 A.2d 348 <em>(1971); Carten </em>v. <em>Carten, </em>153 Conn. 603, 610, 219 A.2d 711 (1966); <em>Felletter </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>133 Conn. 277, 280, 50 A.2d 81 (1946) <em>(Maltbie, C. J.). </em>We conclude that the trial court should have addressed the defendants\u2019 jurisdictional challenge before ruling on the plaintiff\u2019s motion for contempt. Accordingly, we hold that the court erred in failing to decide the jurisdictional claim raised by the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">There is error, the judgment of the trial court is set aside and the case is remanded to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">In this opinion Healey, Armentano and BREnnAn, Js., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b309-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 52-278j (a) provides: \u201cIf an application for a prejudgment remedy is granted but the plaintiff, within ninety days thereof, does not serve and return to court the writ, summons and complaint for which the prejudgment remedy was allowed, the court on its own motion or on the motion of any interested party may dismiss the prejudgment remedy.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b310-7\">Peters, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AxM\">(concurring). I am troubled by the apparent readiness of the majority opinion to grant procedural priority to any challenge to judicial action as long as that challenge is couched in terms of jurisdiction. I recognize that the position taken by the majority has strong roots in history and in our case law. I doubt, however, that the interests of efficient administration of justice are best served by attaching talismanic effect to the label \u201cjurisdictional,\u201d especially when the issue is at most one of jurisdiction over the person.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-8\">Jurisdictional issues may of course, in some eases, impinge on constitutional rights to procedural due <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>process. See <em>Hodge </em>v. <em>Hodge, </em>178 Conn. 308, 318-19, 422 A.2d 280 (1979); <em>Shaffer </em>v. <em>Heitner, </em>433 U.S. 186, 207-12, 97 S. Ct. 2569, 53 L. Ed. 2d 683 (1977). For that reason, they may require extraordinary judicial responsiveness. Cf. Dobbs, \u201cBeyond Bootstrap: Foreclosing the Issue of Subject-Matter Jurisdiction Before Final Judgment,\u201d 51 Minn. L. Rev. 491, 520-21 (1967). Ordinarily, however, adjudication of constitutional infirmity requires a specific showing of personal injury; <em>Weil </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>185 Conn. 495, 501, 441 A.2d 142 (1981); <em>Hardware Mutual Casualty Co. </em>v. <em>Premo, </em>153 Conn. 465, 471, 217 A.2d 698 (1966); that is conspicuously lacking here.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">There is certainly nothing inherently unconstitutional or jurisdictional in time constraints. We ourselves have refused to hold jurisdictional the provision in Practice Book \u00a7 3007 that imposes a twenty day limitation on appeals to this court. <em>LaReau </em>v. <em>Reincke, </em>158 Conn. 486, 492-93, 264 A.2d 576 (1969). See also <em>Reeb </em>v. <em>Economic Opportunity Atlanta, Inc., </em>516 F.2d 924, 926-27 (5th Cir. 1975); <em>Philbrick </em>v. <em>Huff, </em>60 Cal. App. 3d 633, 640-41, 131 Cal. Rptr. 733 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">On the record before us, it seems to me that the plaintiff has made out a plausible case that the statute at issue, General Statutes \u00a7 52-278j, is not jurisdictional. The statute appears to empower the trial court to exercise discretion, since it states that, in proper circumstances, \u201cthe court. . . <em>may </em>dismiss the prejudgment remedy.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Authority to exercise discretion is not notably a hallmark of jurisdictional statutes. The plaintiff\u2019s version of the facts, moreover, supports its argument that the statute is nonjurisdietional. Although <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>the plaintiff does not deny that it failed to serve the defendant <em>after </em>the granting of the prejndgment remedy, it maintains that the defendant was properly served <em>prior </em>to the granting of the prejudgment remedy. As the plaintiff interprets ^ 52-278j, dismissal of the prejudgment remedy would he warranted only if the defendant had not been served at any time before the expiration of the statutory ninety day period. The statute would, in effect, establish an outer limit for the timeliness of the service of process without negating the effect of earlier service.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">I concur in the result reached by the majority because it appears to me not clear whether the plaintiff\u2019s allegations about the prior service of process are sustained by the record. The briefs of the parties are conflicting on this point and this court cannot resolve that conflict.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
