J.</author>\n<p id=\"Atc\">The plaintiff, Patrick Link, brought this action in two counts against the defendant city of Shelton for indemnification under \u00a7 53-39U<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> of the General Statutes. The defendant has appealed from a summary judgment rendered on the first count in favor of the plaintiff, formerly a patrolman with the defendant\u2019s police department, holding that pursuant to \u00a7 53-39a the plaintiff is entitled to indemnification for \u201clegal fees necessarily incurred\u201d in defending against a prosecution for the crime of breach of the peace. The plaintiff has cross appealed from a summary judgment rendered on the second count in favor of the defendant, holding that the plaintiff is not entitled to attorney\u2019s fees that he incurred in the instant case to enforce his right to indemnification under \u00a7 53-39a. We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">This action arose out of the following incident: The plaintiff reported for work twenty minutes late. The desk officer told him to report to the lieutenant\u2019s office; he did so. The lieutenant told him to wait for the captain; he did so. A discussion followed among the plaintiff, the lieutenant, and the captain regarding the plaintiff\u2019s being late for work. The discussion became an altercation, as a result of which the plaintiff was relieved from duty with pay and charged with breach of the peace. After a departmental hearing the plaintiff was discharged without pay. At a trial before a jury, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>the plaintiff was found not guilty of the charges. The plaintiff then \"brought the present action against the city of Shelton for: (1) indemnification under \u00a7 53-39a for the \u201clegal fees necessarily incurred\u201d in the criminal proceeding; and (2) recovery of the attorney\u2019s fees he incurred in this action \u201cto enforce his right to indemnification pursuant to Sec. 53-39a,\u201d which the plaintiff argues also applies to this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">The court granted the plaintiff\u2019s motion for summary judgment on the first count, concluding that \u00a7 53-39a authorizes indemnification of the attorney\u2019s fees incurred by the plaintiff in the criminal proceeding, and in a supplemental judgment it found the amount to which he was entitled to be $6066.10. The court, on a stipulation of facts, granted the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment on the second count, concluding that \u00a7 53-39a does not authorize recovery by the plaintiff of the attorney\u2019s fees he incurred in the action for indemnification. From the summary judgment rendered in favor of the plaintiff on the first count, the defendant has appealed, claiming that the plaintiff was not \u201cin the course of his duty\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 53-39a so as to be entitled to indemnification or, if he were, that the amount of the award was excessive.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> From the summary judgment in favor of the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>on the second count, the plaintiff has cross appealed, claiming that \u00a7 53-39a authorizes his recovery not only for the fees he incurred in the criminal proceeding \"but also for the fees he incurred in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b639-7\">General Statutes \u00a7 53-39a authorizes indemnification for legal fees incurred by an officer of a local police department as a result of prosecution for a crime allegedly committed by him \u201cin the course his duty\u201d where he is found not guilty of the crime charged. \u201c[I]n the course of his duty\u201d is not defined by the statute or explained by legislative history. As a term of art, or technical phrase, it has \u201ca peculiar and appropriate meaning in the law\u201d and \u201cshall be construed and understood accordingly.\u201d General Statutes \u00a71-1 (a). See 2A Sutherland, Statutes and Statutory Construction (4th Ed. Sands 1973) \u00a747.29. Because the statute does not define the phrase, we must look elsewhere for the \u201cpeculiar and appropriate meaning\u201d of \u201cin the course of his duty.\u201d We may look to the meaning given the same phrase in unrelated statutes, in this case the workers\u2019 compensation statutes ; General Statutes \u00a7 31-275 et seq.; and consider that where the legislature uses the same phrase it intends the same meaning. See 2A Sutherland, Statutes and Statutory Construction, supra, \u00a7 53.03.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-8\">It is undisputed that the facts of this case satisfy the statutory requirement that the officer be found not guilty of a crime allegedly committed. The defendant, however, claims that the statutory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>requirement that the crime be \u201callegedly committed by such officer in the course of his duty\u201d is not satisfied where an officer is \u201creporting to work late, throwing temper tantrums, or creating a disturbance in the police station waiting room.\u201d Therefore, it argues, the statutory condition for indemnification is not satisfied. We disagree. These are new facts alleged by the defendant for the first time on appeal. These facts were not part of the pleadings or affidavits below. When we consider facts that do appear in the record, namely, that the plaintiff was on duty; that he had reported for duty late; that he was told to see the lieutenant and did so; that he was told to wait for the captain and did so; and that there was a discussion and altercation resulting in the plaintiff\u2019s being charged with breach of the peace, we conclude that he was in the course of his duty within the meaning of \u00a7 53-39a. See General Statutes \u00a731-275 (12).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b640-6\">Even were we to accept the city\u2019s new version of the facts, our conclusion would be the same. This may be seen from the interpretation given \u201carising out of and in the course of employment\u201d under the workers\u2019 compensation statute. Assaults, for example, are considered as arising out of and in the course of employment \u201ceither if the risk of assault is increased because of the nature or setting of the work, or if the reason for the assault was a quarrel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>having its origin in the work. A few jurisdictions deny compensation if the claimant himself was the aggressor; most reject this defense if the employment in fact caused the fight to break out.\u201d 1 Larsen, The Law of Workmen\u2019s Compensation (1978) \u00a7 11.00. The \u201cscope of the employment\u201d test in the context of vicarious liability is also an aid: \u201c[T]he present tendency is to extend the employer\u2019s responsibility\u201d to \u201cintentional torts . . . reasonably connected with the employment . . . .\u201d Prosser, Torts (4th Ed. 1971) \u00a7 70, p. 464. See Davis, \u201cWorkmen\u2019s Compensation in Connecticut\u2014The Necessary Work Connection,\u201d 7 Conn. L. Rev. 199, 244-46 (1975). Even if the plaintiff had done what the defendant alleges, he would have been acting in the course of his duty so as to be entitled to indemnification under \u00a7 53-39a.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b641-7\">The amount of attorney\u2019s fees to be awarded rests in the sound discretion of the trial court and will not be disturbed on appeal unless the trial court has abused its discretion: \u201cA court has few duties of a more delicate nature than that of fixing counsel fees. The degree of delicacy increases when the matter becomes one of review on appeal. The principle of law, which is easy to state but difficult at times to apply, is that only in case of a clear abuse of discretion by the trier may we interfere. <em>Hayward </em>v. <em>Plant, </em>98 Conn. 374, 382, 119 A. 341 [1923] .... The trier is always in a more advantageous position to evaluate the services of counsel than are we.\u201d <em>Hoenig </em>v. <em>Lubetkin, </em>137 Conn. 516, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>525, 79 A.2d 278 (1951). The court was presented with an affidavit<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> concerning the plaintiff\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees and heard expert witnesses testify on behalf of both parties. We cannot say that the court abused its discretion in concluding that $6066.10 was a proper award.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>III</p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">The plaintiff, in his cross appeal from the summary judgment rendered in favor of the defendant on the second count, supports his plea for attorney\u2019s fees incurred in this action \u201cto enforce his right to indemnification\u201d with cases brought under the Civil Rights Attorney\u2019s Fees Awards Act of 1976, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988 (1976). His analogy is inapposite.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-7\">The federal act authorizes an award of attorney\u2019s fees in the discretion of the court \u201cas part of the costs\u201d of the \u201caction or proceeding to enforce\u201d enumerated civil rights provisions.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The question of attorney\u2019s fees comes up as part of the underlying action and not in an independent action for recovery of attorney\u2019s fees. The award of attorney\u2019s fees is part of the \u201caction or proceeding to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>enforce\u201d the civil rights provisions. As snch it falls within the express anthorization of \u00a7 1988 and no extension of the express authorization is required to authorize it.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">On the other hand, the Connecticut statute under which the plaintiff seeks to recover attorney\u2019s fees authorizes an award of legal fees as \u201ceconomic loss sustained ... as a result of <em>such </em>prosecution.\u201d (Emphasis added.) It does not thereby authorize an award of attorney\u2019s fees sustained as a result of some other action. We conclude that the legislature, in authorizing indemnification for attorney\u2019s fees sustained \u201cas a result of such prosecution,\u201d did not authorize recovery of attorney\u2019s fees sustained as a result of a separate action to enforce the right to indemnification under ^ 53-39a.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-7\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b637-7\"> General Statutes <em>\u00a7 </em>53-39a provides in relevant part as follows: \u201cWhenever, in any prosecution of an officer of the division of state police ... or a local police department for a crime allegedly committed by such officer in the course of his duty as such, the charge is dismissed or the officer found not guilty, such officer shall be indemnified by his employing governmental unit for economic loss sustained by him as a result of such prosecution, including the payment of any legal fees necessarily incurred.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b638-6\"> The defendant also claims that summary judgment in favor of the plaintiff was improper because there was a genuine issue of material fact, namely, whether the alleged crime occurred in the course of the plaintiff\u2019s duty. At oral argument before us, the defendant did not dispute that the plaintiff was on duty but characterized as a question of fact the question of whether the plaintiff\u2019s actions come within the ambit of General Statutes \u00a7 53-39a. That question is a legal question of statutory interpretation, and does not become a question of fact by virtue of a litigant\u2019s labeling it a question of fact.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b640-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 31-275 (12) provides in relevant part as follows: \u201c \u2018Arising out of and in the course of his employment\u2019 means . . . originating while he has been engaged in the line of his duty in the business or affairs of the employer upon the employer\u2019s premises, or while so engaged elsewhere upon the employer\u2019s business or affairs by the direction, express or implied, of the employer.
