Healey, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aqa\">After a trial to a jury, the defendant was found guilty of sexual assault in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-70<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The trial court denied his motion to set aside the verdict and this appeal followed. On appeal, he alleges that the court erred: (1) in admitting the victim\u2019s out-of-court statements <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>identifying the defendant as her assailant; (2) in charging the jury with respect to evidence of constancy of accusation; (3) in finding the victim\u2019s ten-year-old son competent to testify; (4) in denying his motion for mistrial following the disqualification of a juror during the trial; and (5) in permitting the state to recall the victim as a witness and to reopen its ease.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">There was evidence<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> presented at the trial from which the jury could reasonably have found the following: On July 1, 1978, the victim, her husband and their three children lived in a six-room home in Berlin.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> At about 10:45 p.m. on that date, the victim was beaten and sexually assaulted in the bathroom of her home by a male wearing a stocking mask over his face. She recognized her assailant as the defendant<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> \u201cright away\u201d as she could see right through the stocking mask which was \u201clike ladies\u2019 stockings, hosiery.\u201d She screamed and he hit her in the mouth \u201cwith a closed fist\u201d; she screamed again and he hit her again in the mouth in the same way. He said, \u201cShut up or I will kill you.\u201d After taking the phone off the hook, he threw her onto the floor on her stomach, sat on her legs and tied her hands behind her back with the belt of her husband\u2019s bathrobe. He then pushed her into the bathroom, closed the door, ripped her nightgown off her shoulders down to her waist and ran his hands all over her body. At that point she felt \u201c[pjetrified, scared to death.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>Her oldest child, T, ten years of age, called her from upstairs.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> She told the defendant that she had better talle to T or he would keep calling her. Thereupon the defendant pushed her down the hall to answer T, and, while the defendant stood behind her, she told T to go back to bed and that she would be up in a few minutes. When they returned to the bathroom the defendant put a child\u2019s pajama top on her head, pushed her down on her knees and \u201cforced [her] to perform oral sex on him several times.\u201d He then told her to lean over the vanity in the bathroom and tried unsuccessfully to penetrate her anus. He again forced her to her knees and he did penetrate her anus. Thereafter, he turned her over on her back and penetrated her vagina.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">The defendant told her to stay there in the bathroom until he got away; she did so for maybe thirty seconds until she heard him leave. She went to the bottom of the stairs where she called T. He came down and, at her request, removed the pajama top froxn her head. Because her hands were tied, she asked T to call the police; it was about five minutes after eleven o\u2019clock. He did so and she spoke to the police with T holding the phone. She tried to reach her parents, but they were not at home. She then had T dial her in-laws. She spoke to her mother-in-law and asked her to come right over.- Berlin Police Officers Chant and Russell responded to the call and came to the victim\u2019s residence in a cruiser.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> When Chant arrived, approximately two minutes after being dispatched, he observed that the victim was bleeding from the mouth, that she had a ripped <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>nightgown, that her hands were bound behind her and that she was hysterical. He attended her \u201cmouth wound\u201d and untied her hands.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">Chant was the policeman who first asked the victim if she knew who her assailant was and she told him she did not know. The victim\u2019s in-laws then arrived. Russell<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> drove the victim and her mother-in-law to the emergency room of New Britain General Hospital. Chant did not accompany them to the hospital although he did drive to the hospital later to pick her up and bring her home. Approximately three hours later, during her return from the hospital in Chant\u2019s cruiser, she identified the defendant as her assailant. Upon her return from the hospital, the victim\u2019s statement was taken by supernumerary police officer Arlene Laviana at the Berlin police headquarters.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The victim told police officers, relatives and a clinical social worker that it was the defendant who had assaulted her.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b537-8\">Against the background of the circumstances already set out, we turn to the defendant\u2019s claims of error on the admission of certain evidence under the \u201cconstancy of accusation\u201d exception to the hearsay rule and its instructions to the jury on that exception. The defendant claims that the admission of the victim\u2019s out-of-court statements identifying him as the assailant does not fall within the \u201cconstancy of accusation\u201d hearsay exception because \u201can <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>inconstancy of accusation\u201d was shown by the evidence. He focuses on what occurred when the police first arrived at her home after being dispatched there at which time, prior to her going to the hospital, she told the police that she did not know who her assailant was. Her first statement, he argues, makes \u201ca permanent break in the chain of constancy of accusation,\u201d and, because she was not constant in her accusations, her declarations were hearsay and thus erroneously admitted. In short, he maintains that the constancy of accusation exception is not applicable to this case. Moreover, because such declarations involved the identification of the defendant, he claims that their admission constituted prejudicial error. We do not agree with these claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Kinney, </em>44 Conn. 153 (1876), we affirmed and elucidated our rule on the \u201cconstancy of accusation\u201d exception, originally laid down in <em>State </em>v. <em>DeWolf, 8 </em>Conn. 93 (1830). See also <em>State </em>v. <em>Brice, </em>186 Conn. 449, 442 A.2d 906 (1982). In <em>Kinney, </em>we pointed out that the testimony of the woman upon whom the offense was allegedly committed could be confirmed<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> by testimony from witnesses to whom she had told the same story out of court. <em>State </em>v. <em>Kinney, </em>supra, 156; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Segerberg, </em>131 Conn. 546, 549, 41 A.2d 101 (1945). We stated that for her to complain of the offense \u201cwould be natural if the crime had been committed, but very unnatural if it had not been.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Kinney, </em>supra. Employing the same principle, we</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>reasoned that her statement of the details ought to be admitted into evidence and that \u201c[i]f her story was true, the evidence would show constancy in the charge even to the details . . . <em>State </em>v. <em>Kinney, </em>supra, 156. In <em>State </em>v. <em>Purvis, </em>157 Conn. 198, 207-208, 251 A.2d 178 (1968), cert. denied, 395 U.S. 928, 89 S. Ct. 1788, 23 L. Ed. 2d 246 (1969), which concerned our review of convictions of rape and kidnapping, we sustained the trial court\u2019s ruling admitting into evidence the testimony of a detective and a policewoman, who, after the victim had first testified to the details of the rape, were permitted to testify as to what she had related to them about the incident. <em>State </em>v. <em>Purvis, </em>supra, 207. In doing so, we said: \u201cThe ruling was in accord with the \u2018constancy of accusation\u2019 exception to the hearsay rule and with a long line of cases in which that exception has been recognized. <em>State </em>v. <em>Dziob, </em>133 Conn 167, 169, 48 A.2d 377 [1946] [incest]; <em>State </em>v. <em>Segerberg, </em>131 Conn. 546, 549, 41 A.2d 101 [1945] [indecent assault]; <em>State </em>v. <em>Orlando, </em>115 Conn. 672, 677, 163 A. 256 [1932] [indecent assault]; <em>State </em>v. <em>Kinney, </em>44 Conn. 153, 155 [1876] [rape]; <em>State </em>v. <em>DeWolf, </em>8 Conn. 93, 100 [1830] [attempt to commit rape].\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Purvis, </em>supra, 207-208; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Greene, </em>161 Conn. 291, 294-95, 287 A.2d 386 (1971); <em>State </em>v. <em>Gelinas, </em>160 Conn. 366, 367, 279 A.2d 552 (1971); see also 2 Wharton, Criminal Evidence (Torcia 13th Ed.) \u00a7 313.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b539-7\">We cannot accept the defendant\u2019s claim that our \u201cconstancy of accusation\u201d rule is not applicable in this case. The defendant would have the circumstance of the victim\u2019s telling the police, who came to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>her home within ten minutes after they were called, that she did not know her assailant be determinative of the issue of applicability of the \u201cconstancy of accusation\u201d exception. Of course, this statement, per se, is not an \u201caccusation\u201d of anyone. Thus, her accusations against the defendant made shortly thereafter to several persons to whom she would naturally make a specific accusation were constant. In other words, once she made an accusation, it remained constant. This applies to such statements made to the victim\u2019s husband, mother-in-law, Chant and Laviana. There was evidence from her mother-in-law that, prior to leaving for the hospital and while in her bedroom, she told her mother-in-law that \u201cshe had been raped by a neighbor Joseph Brigandi.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The victim repeated the accusation to Chant during the drive back from the hospital, to Laviana early in the morning of July 2,1978, at the Berlin police headquarters and to her husband upon his return on July 2,1978.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">A close examination of the evidence before the jury discloses the reason why the victim told the police that she did not know who her assailant was.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> She testified: \u201cThe reason was because of my feelings for my son and for his [the defendant\u2019s] children.\u201d There was evidence before the jury that the victim\u2019s family and the Brigandi family were \u201csocially friendly\u201d; that the two couples visited with each other and on occasion went to dinner; that the two couples had been neighbors for about five years; that the defendant had been the cub scout <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>leader of the pack in which T, the victim\u2019s son, was a member; that the victim had been the den mother of that same pack and that on the afternoon of July 1, 1978, the defendant had taken his three children and T to the movies just hours before the assault occurred. The reason that the victim did not tell the police initially was, therefore, a fact for the jury to pass upon with all the other evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">Under the circumstances, the trial court did not err in ruling that the doctrine of \u201cconstancy of accusation\u201d applied to the evidentiary rulings attacked. Whatever delay took place between the time of the attack and the time the victim first told witnesses of it does not affect the admissibility of the evidence, but merely presents a question of fact for the trier as to the weight to be given it. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Dziob, </em>133 Conn. 167, 169, 48 A.2d 377 (1946); <em>State </em>v. <em>Sebastian, </em>81 Conn. 1, 6, 69 A. 1054 (1908).</p>\n<p id=\"b541-7\">Additionally, the defendant claims that the court erred in charging the jury with respect to the evidence of constancy of accusation. He argues here that because of the victim\u2019s \u201cinitial inconsistent statements, constancy of accusation should not have been an element in the trial.\u201d He also observes that the \u201cinconsistency in accusation\u201d was recognized by the court in its instructions when it referred to her first statement to Chant at her home and that which she made to him during the return trip from the hospital.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>In ruling during the trial that the evidence concerning constancy of accusation, an exception to the hearsay rule, was admissible, the court acted in its capacity as the arbiter of the law in admitting or excluding proffered evidence. We have already held that the court was correct in its ruling. We observe that even if it be argued that the admissibility of evidence (here the claimed inconsistency) depends upon a preliminary question of fact to be determined by the court, \u201cits decision is not to be reversed unless there is clear and manifest error.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> <em>Engelke </em>v. <em>Wheatley, </em>148 Conn. 398, 411, 171 A.2d 402 (1961). Having made its ruling on admissibility, the court, under adequate instructions on the limitations on the jury\u2019s use of the evidence concerning the issue of constancy of accusation, left it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>to the jury to decide as a question of fact \u201cwhether she [the victim] has been constant and consistent in what she has said.\u201d We find no error on this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">The defendant has also argued that the admission of this evidence under the constancy of accusation exception to the hearsay rule denied his right of confrontation guaranteed him by the sixth amendment to the United States constitution and article first of the Connecticut constitution. We cannot accept this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-7\">We are aware that \u201cthe Sixth Amendment\u2019s right of an accused to confront the witnesses against him is ... a fundamental right and is made obligatory on the States by the Fourteenth Amendment.\u201d <em>Pointer </em>v. Texas, 380 U.S. 400, 403, 85 S. Ct. 1065, 13 L. Ed. 2d 923 (1965). For our purposes, it must be recognized that there are clearly different kinds of hearsay testimony, the character of which must be examined in any given case where a denial of the constitutional right of confrontation is claimed. In that regard, the United States Supreme Court has stated: \u201cWhile it may readily be conceded that hearsay rules and the Confrontation Clause are generally designed to protect similar values, it is quite a different thing to suggest that the overlap is complete and that the Confrontation Clause is nothing more or less than a codification of the rules of hearsay and their exceptions as they existed historically at common law. Our decisions have never established such a congruence; indeed, we have more than once found a violation of confrontation values even though the statements in issue were admitted under an arguably recognized hearsay exception. See <em>Barber </em>v. <em>Page, </em>390 U.S. 719 [88 S. Ct. 1318, 20 L. Ed. 2d 255] (1968); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number><em>Pointer </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>380 U.S. 400 [85 S. Ct. 1065, 13 L. Ed. 2d 923] (1965). The converse is equally true: merely because evidence is admitted in violation of a long-established hearsay rule does not lead to the automatic conclusion that confrontation rights have been denied.\u201d <em>California </em>v. <em>Green, </em>399 U.S. 149, 155-56, 90 S. Ct. 1930, 26 L. Ed. 2d 489 (1970), Thus, the sixth amendment right of confrontation cannot be construed as merely codifying the hearsay rule and its recognized exceptions. <em>California </em>v. <em>Green, </em>supra; <em>Dutton </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>400 U.S. 74, 91 S. Ct. 210, 27 L. Ed. 2d 213 (1970). In <em>Dutton </em>the court stated: \u201cThe decisions of this Court make it clear that the mission of the Confrontation Clause is to advance a practical concern for the accuracy of the truth-determining process in criminal trials by assuring that \u2018the trier of the fact [has] a satisfactory basis for evaluating the truth of the prior statement.\u2019 \u201d <em>Dutton </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>supra, 89, citing <em>California </em>v. <em>Green, </em>supra, 161. It is the literal right to confront the witness at, the time of trial \u201cthat forms the core of the values furthered by the confrontation clause. ...\u201d <em>California </em>v. <em>Green, </em>supra, 157; see <em>Mattox </em>v. <em>United States, </em>156 U.S. 237, 242-43, 15 S. Ct. 337, 39 L. Ed. 2d 409 (1895); <em>State </em>v. <em>DeSantis, </em>178 Conn. 534, 546, 423 A.2d 149 (1979); <em>State </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>173 Conn. 317, 324, 377 A.2d 1082 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">Our determination that there was no denial of the defendant\u2019s right of confrontation is reinforced when we compare the purposes of confrontation with the alleged dangers in admitting the out-of-court testimony objected to here. \u201cConfrontation: (1) insures that the witness will give his statements under oath\u2014thus impressing him with the seriousness of the matter and guarding against the lie by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>the possibility of a penalty for perjury; (2) forces the witness to submit to cross-examination, the \u2018greatest legal engine ever invented for the discovery of truth\u2019; (3) permits the jury that is to decide the defendant\u2019s fate to observe the demeanor of the witness in making his statement, thus aiding the jury in assessing his credibility.\u201d <em>Calfornia </em>v. <em>Green, </em>supra, 158. \u201c[The right of cross examination] is the principal means by which the believability of a witness and the truth of his testimony are tested <em>(Davis </em>v. <em>Alaska, </em>415 U.S. 308, 316 [94 S. Ct. 1105, 39 L. Ed. 2d 347 (1974)]; cf. <em>Hoffa </em>v. <em>United States, </em>385 U.S. 293 [87 S. Ct. 408, 17 L. Ed. 2d 374 (1966)], rehearing den. 386 U.S. 940 [87 S. Ct. 970, 17 L. Ed. 2d 880 (1967)]).\u201d <em>People </em>v. <em>Conyers, </em>86 Misc. 2d 754, 758, 382 N.Y.S.2d 437 (1976), aff\u2019d, 63 App. Div. 2d 634, 405 N.Y.S.2d 409 (1978). The defendant was able to confront the victim at trial with the opportunity to cross-examine her under oath before the jury. The same was true of each and every witness who testified on the matter of constancy of accusation. There was no violation of his right to confrontation.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b545-7\">The defendant next claims that the court erred in finding the victim\u2019s ten-year-old son, T, competent to testify. In pressing this claim, the defendant maintains that it was a clear abuse of discretion for the trial court to have found this witness competent. We cannot accept this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-8\">T was ten years old at the time of trial<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> and attended school in the fifth grade. In the absence of the jury, he was examined by the court, counsel for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>the state and counsel for the defendant. In his brief the defendant maintains that T \u201cadmitted little understanding of essential obligation [of an oath],\u201d that he \u201cadmitted not knowing what it meant not to tell a lie,\u201d- that he \u201cindicated that telling a lie would get him into trouble,\u201d that he \u201cadmitted that he did not know what it meant to tell the truth,\u201d that he \u201cindicated that his limited understanding of the oath was based upon instruction by the State\u2019s Attorney\u201d and that \u201che agreed that he was \u2018parroting\u2019 what he had been told.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">\u201cThis court recently has had occasion to discuss the standards by which the competency of a child witness to testify is to be determined. \u2018The testimonial capacity of a child witness is a matter for the court to determine upon inquiry. <em>State </em>v. <em>Segerberg, </em>131 Conn. 546, 547, 41 A.2d 101 (1945). In Connecticut, the examination to determine the competency of a witness is usually conducted by counsel under direction of the court, except insofar as the court may find it advisable to intervene. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Orlando, </em>115 Conn. 672, 676, 163 A. 256 (1932). Because the competency of a witness is a matter peculiarly within the discretion of the trial court, its ruling will be disturbed only in a clear case of abuse or of some error in law. <em>State </em>v. <em>Siberon, </em>166 Conn. 455, 457, 352 A.2d 285 (1974); <em>State </em>v. <em>Orlando, </em>supra, 675; <em>Kuczon </em>v. <em>Tomkievicz, </em>100 Conn. 560, 572-73, 124 A. 226 (1924).</p>\n<p id=\"b546-7\">\u2018In determining the competency of child witnesses, age is not the decisive factor. See <em>Kuczon </em>v. <em>Tomkievicz, </em>supra, 570; McCormick, Evidence (2d Ed.) \u00a7 62. Instead, the trial court must consider \u201cthe proposed witness\u2019 maturity to receive correct impressions by his senses, ability to recollect and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>narrate intelligently, and ability to appreciate the moral duty to tell the truth.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Siberon, </em>supra, 458. The witness should also have an intelligent comprehension of the facts sought to be developed. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Segerberg, </em>supra, 548; <em>Kuczon </em>v. <em>Tomkievicz, </em>supra, 570; McCormick, loc. cit.\u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>180 Conn. 382, 388, 429 A.2d 919 (1980). See also 2 Wharton, Criminal Evidence (13th Ed.) \u00a7\u00a7 379-380.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Stankowski, </em>184 Conn. 121, 139-40, 439 A.2d 918, cert. denied, 454 U.S. 1052, 102 S. Ct. 596, 70 L. Ed. 2d 588 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">Upon reviewing the evidence, we do not agree with the defendant\u2019s claim that the trial judge abused his discretion by allowing T to testify. We are aware that a trial judge, in making such a determination as involved here, does so \u201cfrom the whole situation, from facts and conduct observed during the examination, as well as from the questions propounded and which stand in the record.\u201d <em>Kuczon </em>v. <em>Tomkievicz, </em>100 Conn, 560, 573-74, 124 A. 226 (1924); see <em>State </em>v. <em>Stankowski, </em>supra. We have examined the transcript and conclude that this witness could be found able to appreciate the moral duty to tell the truth and that he sufficiently understood the meaning of taking an oath to tell the truth.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Insofar as it is claimed that his limited <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>understanding of the oath was based upon instruction by the state\u2019s attorney, the printed record does not sustain that argument; the same is true of his affirmative answer to defense counsel\u2019s question, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>\u201cSort of parroting what he [the State\u2019s Attorney] said.\u201d We have had occasion to state: \u201cCareful and conscientious instruction of young children who are prospective witnesses, honestly conducted by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>parents or by upright counsel as to the nature, obligation and sanctions of an oath is entirely proper. Drilling such children mechanically to commit to memory certain matters in order to pass the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>judge would deserve a different characterization. The trial judge had peculiar facilities for solving this problem.\u201d <em>Kuczon </em>v. <em>Tomkievicz, </em>supra, 574. That principle applies here.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The ruling on competency was correct.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b551-7\">The defendant also claims that the trial court erred in denying his motion for a mistrial follow<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>ing the disqualification of a juror during the trial.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The defendant\u2019s claim of error in the denial of a mistrial is two-pronged. He argues that (1) the juror became a witness in the case without the precaution of an oath and without an opportunity for cross-examination by the defendant; and (2) the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>\u201ccontinued presence\u201d of the juror on the panel created circumstances capable of influencing the deliberative function of the jury. He maintains that this action of the trial court denied his rights to a trial by an impartial jury and due process of law in violation of the sixth and fourteenth amendments to the United States constitution and article first, section 8 of the Connecticut constitution. We must reject these claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">The victim was the first witness called by the state. After she had testified for a short time on direct examination, a juror, one Mrs. Smith, addressed the court saying: \u201cI probably should be excused. I have chaired a committee with this lady.\u201d Defense counsel thereupon stated: \u201cIf your Honor please, excuse the jury.\u201d The court then said: \u201cThe jury may be excused. Well, the young lady will remain.\u201d Whereupon, the jury left the courtroom while Mrs. Smith remained. The court and defense counsel then questioned Mrs. Smith and the court excused her. In excusing her, the eourt instructed her not to discuss the matter with any member of the jury and directed her to report downstairs to the clerk in charge of the jury. Defense counsel then moved for a mistrial claiming prejudice pointing out that Mrs. Smith\u2019s statement before the jury that she served on \u201ccommittees\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> with the victim put the defendant in a \u201cGod-awful light\u201d and tended to place the victim in a good light before the jury. This factor, the defendant claimed, prejudiced his case because \u201c[o]ne of the claims in this case is that this lady entices gentlemen into this relationship or liaison.\u201d The court denied the motion for mistrial, ordered the selection of an alternate to take Mrs. Smith\u2019s place on the jury and stated that its reason <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>for denying the mistrial was that it found no prejudice. Before the jury returned, defense counsel requested that, with respect to Mrs. Smith\u2019s no longer being a juror, the court instruct the jury that it was \u201cnot to draw any inferences of what was said or transpired.\u201d The trial court did so when the jury returned.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">Impartiality as a core requirement of the right to trial by jury is served not only by the sixth amendment, which applies to the states as well as to the federal government; see, e.g., <em>Witherspoon </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>391 U.S. 510, 529, 88 S. Ct. 1770, 20 L. Ed. 2d 776 (1968) (Douglas, J., concurring); <em>Parker </em>v. <em>Gladden, </em>385 U.S. 363, 364, 87 S. Ct. 468, 17 L. Ed. 2d 420 (1966); but also by the due process and equal protection clauses of the fourteenth amendment. See, e.g., <em>Peters </em>v. <em>Kiff, </em>407 U.S. 493, 92 S. Ct. 2163, 33 L. Ed. 2d 83 (1972). We have held that the due process clauses of both the United States and Connecticut constitutions have the same meaning and impose similar limitations. \u201cIn essence, the right to jury trial guarantees to the criminally accused a fair trial by a panel of impartial, \u2018indifferent\u2019 jurors.\u201d <em>Irvin </em>v. <em>Dowd, </em>366 U.S. 717, 722, 81 S. Ct. 1639, 6 L. Ed. 2d 751 (1961). \u201cDue process requires that a criminal defendant be given a fair trial before an impartial judge and an unprejudiced <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>jury in an atmosphere of judicial calm. U.S. Const., amend. XIV; Conn. Const., art. I, \u00a7 8 .... In a criminal trial, the judge is more than a mere moderator of the proceedings. It is his responsibility to have the trial conducted in a manner which approaches an \u2018atmosphere of perfect impartiality which is so much to be desired in a judicial proceeding.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Echols, </em>170 Conn. 11, 13, 364 A.2d 225 (1975). Because the judge is not an interlocutor presiding over a debate, but is a minister of justice, he is, to that end, empowered to exercise a reasonable discretion in the conduct of a trial. See <em>Connecticut Light &amp; Power Co. </em>v. <em>Kluczinsky, </em>171 Conn. 516, 521, 370 A.2d 1306 (1976); <em>McWilliams </em>v. <em>American Fidelity Co., </em>140 Conn. 572, 580-81, 102 A.2d 345 (1954). \u201cThe trial judge is the arbiter of the many circumstances which may arise during the trial in which his function is to assure a fair and just outcome.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Bausman, </em>162 Conn. 308, 312, 294 A.2d 312 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b555-4\">\u201cThe general principle is that a mistrial should be granted only as a result of some occurrence upon the trial of such a character that it is apparent to the court that because of it a party cannot have a fair trial[;] <em>State </em>v. <em>Peary, </em>176 Conn. 170, 172-73, 405 A.2d 626 (1978); <em>State </em>v. <em>Ruiz, </em>171 Conn. 264, 368 A.2d 222 (1976); <em>State </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>169 Conn. 692, 703, 364 A.2d 186 (1975); <em>State </em>v. <em>Rose, </em>168 Conn. 623, 635, 362 A.2d 813 (1975)\u201d; <em>State </em>v. <em>Turcio, </em>178 Conn. 116, 143, 422 A.2d 749 (1979); \u201cand the whole proceedings are vitiated.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Peary, </em>176 Conn. 170, 173, 405 A.2d 626 (1978); see <em>State </em>v. <em>Hafner, </em>168 Conn. 230, 245-46, 362 A.2d 925 (1975). The court has wide discretion in passing on motions for mistrial. <em>State </em>v. <em>Turcio, </em>supra; <em>State </em>v. <em>Ruiz, </em>supra, 274; <em>State </em>v. <em>Bausman, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>Applying these principles to the claim of the defendant, we conclude that the trial court acted properly and within its discretion in denying this motion for mistrial. The juror, Mrs. Smith, was not a \u201cwitness\u201d as claimed; she was acting as a juror. The trial court, after her statement which resulted in the excusing of her fellow jurors from the courtroom, examined her in her capacity as a juror and in its function of endeavoring to assure a fair trial. During this questioning by the court, defense counsel actually asked several questions of the juror and the state directed no questions to the juror. After the jurors returned, the court instructed them as requested by defense counsel and no exception was taken to that instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">We are not persuaded, after careful consideration, that the defendant\u2019s claim, that Mrs. Smith\u2019s \u201ccontinued presence\u201d on the panel created circumstances capable of influencing the deliberative function of the jury, has merit. Our examination of the record before us leads us to find no substance to this claim keeping in mind, inter alia, the circumstance that this occurred only minutes after the start of the direct examination of the state\u2019s first witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-7\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b556-8\">The defendant\u2019s final claim of error is twofold. It maintains that the court erred in (1) permitting the state \u201crepeatedly\u201d to recall the victim; and (2) permitting the state to reopen its case in chief. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-9\">During the trial the victim testified on three occasions. She was the state\u2019s first witness testifying on October 30, 1979. On the next day, she was recalled by the state and testified. On the afternoon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>of November 1, 1979, the state rested and court adjourned for the day. The next morning, before the defense went forward with its evidence, the state moved to reopen its case in order to make an offer of proof and to put a neighbor on whom the state had forgotten to put on.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> The state then said it wanted to put the victim back on the stand to \u201cask her why she did not make a positive indentifieation of the defendant when the police officers first walked into the house.\u201d The defense objected,<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> particularly to her being permitted to return to the witness stand, pointing out that this was an attempt to refute cross-examination of a witness who testified after the victim had.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">We have noted that it is within the sound discretion of the court to permit the state to reopen its case after it has rested. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Levy, </em>103 Conn. 138, 145, 130 A. 96 (1925); <em>State </em>v. <em>Ricker, </em>90 Conn. 147, 152, 96 A. 941 (1916); see generally 23 C.J.S., Criminal Law \u00a7 1055. \u201c \u2018The reopening of a criminal case either to present omitted evidence or to add further testimony after either of the parties has rested is within the sound discretion of the Trial Court. <em>Harrison </em>v. <em>United States, </em>5 Cir. 1968, 387 F.2d 614; <em>Massey </em>v. <em>United States, </em>10 Cir. 1966, 358 F.2d 782; <em>Lucas </em>v. <em>United States, </em>8 Cir. 1965, 343 F.2d 1.\u2019 <em>United States </em>v. <em>Wilcox, </em>450 F.2d 1131, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>1143 (5th Cir. 1971).\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Sisack, </em>527 F.2d 917, 919 (9th Cir. 1976). \u201c[T]he trial court must he vested with discretion to permit reopening when mere inadvertence or some other compelling circumstance . . . justifies a reopening and no substantial prejudice will occur.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Hinderman, </em>625 F.2d 994, 996 (10th Cir. 1980); see <em>United States ex rel. Carraway </em>v. <em>McMann, </em>297 F. Sup. 390, 394-95 (S.D.N.Y. 1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">\u201cThe matter of recalling a witness after he had testified rests within the sound judicial discretion of the trial court and the exercise of such discretion will not be interfered with unless there is a clear showing of abuse. This appears to be the universal rule. [Citations omitted.]\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Droste, </em>232 N.W.2d 483, 488 (Iowa 1975); see <em>Faust </em>v. <em>United States, </em>163 U.S. 452, 455, 16 S. Ct. 1112, 41 L.

Co., </em>supra, 207, the court said: \u201cWhere a witness is recalled to testify after his direct and cross-examination, he should be permitted to state the reason for altering or modifying his testimony. This should be allowed in order that the jury could properly evaluate the credibility to be given the whole of the testimony presented by said witness.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b558-7\">In this case although the reopening was granted, it took place before the defense went forward with its evidence. The matter presented at that time through the victim had already been touched on earlier. The evidence of the other witness whom <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>the state admitted it had forgotten to pnt on had also been touched on earlier. The defense had full opportunity to examine and cross-examine and no surprise was claimed. No prejudice to the defendant has been demonstrated, nor was there any denial of his right to a fair trial. There was no abuse of discretion in denying the defendant\u2019s motion for mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b534-12\"> The information, charged, inter alia, that the defendant \u201cdid compel another person to engage in sexual intercourse by the use of force, in violation of Section 53a-70 of the General Statutes.\u201d The bill of particulars alleged that \u201cOn July 1, 1978, during the evening . . . the defendant struck a female victim, tied her hands, threatened to kill the victim\u2019s young son and assaulted her sexually.

Also, to her mother-in-law . . . when the two were talking in the victim\u2019s bedroom, shortly after the incident, that she was raped by her neighbor, Joseph Brigandi. Well, to Officer Chant on her way back home from the hospital that the assailant was her neighbor, Mr. Brigandi. This was stated about three hours after she said to him she didn\u2019t know the assailant. To Officer Arlene Laviana that Joe Brigandi did it. These statements were admitted in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"ATa\">\u201cNow, the reason for that is this: [The victim] testified here in Court as to the offense she claims was committed upon her; now if that was all you had before you, you would naturally ask yourselves why did she keep silent about it until she came to Court to testify?

See <em>State </em>v. <em>Segerberg, </em>131 Conn. 546, 548, 41 A.2d 101 (1945).</p>\n<p id=\"b551-10\">We have observed that where such a claim is actually made, there is a procedure for the defendant to follow. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>180 Conn. 382, 429 A.2d 919 (1980). In <em>Rodriguez, </em>where such a claim was actually made and briefed, we said: \u201cIn order to demonstrate to this court that the error committed by the trial court was harmful, it was incumbent upon the defendant to include in his brief those portions of the transcript of Serrano\u2019s testimony that evidence Serrano\u2019s actual inability to comprehend intelligently the facts sought to be developed or to recollect and narrate intelligently those facts. This was not done. Such an examination of the testimony given is necessary, for even though a proper foundation had not been laid establishing competency at the preliminary hearing, had the testimony later given satisfied the applicable tests, any error in the preliminary ruling would not be considered harmful.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>supra, 391.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-11\">Despite the defendant\u2019s failure to follow this procedure, we have, nevertheless, in the interests of justice examined all the testimony given by T, both at the preliminary hearing in the absence of the jury and before the jury. The evidence he gave does demonstrate T\u2019s ability to recollect and narrate intelligently those facts.
