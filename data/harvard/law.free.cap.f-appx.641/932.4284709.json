Chisolm was also charged in three counts of distributing crack cocaine and one count of distributing cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1). On June 30, 2008, Bol-ware and Kimball each pled guilty to the conspiracy count pursuant to a \u201cPlea and Cooperation Agreement,\u201d in which they agreed to cooperate with the government.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> They were sentenced on October 1, 2008. Bolware received the mandatory life sentence called for by his plea agreement.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"934\">*934</page-number>Kimball was imprisoned for a term of 120 months.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Chisolm, maintaining that he was not guilty, stood trial on January 9, 2009.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b946-4\">Chisolm was convicted on all counts and sentenced to concurrent terms of life imprisonment on four counts, under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(b), 851, and 360 months on one count. He appealed his convictions and sentences.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We affirmed. <em>United States v. Chisolm, </em>367 Fed.Appx 43 (11th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b946-5\">After his convictions and sentences were affirmed, Chisolm moved the District Court for relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, challenging his convictions on nine grounds and his sentences on four. The District Court denied his motion without an eviden-tiary hearing. He appeals the decision. We entertain his appeal on the two issues cited in the certificate of appealability we issued: whether Chisolm\u2019s trial counsel was ineffective for failing to communicate the Government\u2019s plea offer to the Chisolm and whether the District Court erred in denying this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-6\">A prisoner is not entitled to an eviden-tiary hearing on a motion for \u00a7 2255 relief unless the allegations of his motion are \u201caffirmatively contradicted by the record, or the claims are patently frivolous.\u201d <em>Aron v. United States, </em>291 F.3d 708, 715 (11th Cir.2002). Chisolm stated the ineffective assistance claim at issue here in the Memorandum. in Support of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 Motion for Relief he submitted to the District Court. The memorandum described the claim thusly:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b946-10\">[TJtrial counsel failed to inform Mov-ant of the government plea offer before he went to trial. Had counsel informed Movant of this plea offer Movant would not have proceeded] to trial. Movant was unaware of the government offer until after trial when counsel inform[ed] movant that the government had offered] a plea bargain. <em>Had Movant k,n[own] of the government plea [offer] Movant would have accepted the plea offer for a lesser sentence than life in prison.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b946-11\">Had Movant accepted the plea offer, <em>the government would not have filed enhanced penalty </em>and if the government had tried to seek enhanced penalties after the offer had been accepted it would have been precluded from doing to under the plea agreement. Without subjection to a mandatory penalty based on narcotics convictions he sustained in 1992 and 1997 Movant[\u2019s] sentence would have been far less than Four life sentence^].<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b947-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"935\">*935</page-number>Doc 182 at 30 (emphasis added). According to this memorandum, the government\u2019s plea offer was that if Chisolm plead guilty to the conspiracy charge,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> the government would not seek a sentencing enhancement by filing a Notice of Intent to Seek Enhanced Sentences under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b947-5\">The government opposed Chisolm\u2019s motion. Its Opposition to Motion to Vacate, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b947-6\">Defendant argues that his counsel failed to communicate a plea offer under which he would have faced less than life in prison. The only plea offer the government made was the same that co-defendant Bolware accept: plead to a mandatory life sentence and try to work for substantial subsistence. Having watched his good friend and co-defendant accept this offer and testify under it, defendant knew the terms of the government\u2019s offer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b947-7\">Defendant somehow conceives that he could have avoided the filing of a sentencing enhancement by a quick plea of guilty. Defendant was added [to the indictment] by the Superseding Indictment returned June 3, 2008. The government\u2019s information and Notice of Intend to Seek Enhanced Sentences was filed on June 10, 2008, six days before defendant\u2019s arraignment. There was never an opportunity for defendant to plead without the enhancement being filed_ Moreover, in this case, any plea had to be delayed until potential issues concerning defendant\u2019s mental condition were resolved.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AKV\">Doc. 191 at 19-20.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-11\">Chisolm\u2019s Reply Memorandum said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b947-12\">The Government states the only plea offer the government made was the same the co-defendant Bolware accepted: plead to a mandatory life sentence and try to work for substantial assistance. Had trial counsel inform[ed] Movant of this deal Movant surely would have accepted this deal and would have surely work[ed] the time off and do[ne] whatever the Government wanted him to do to see the street again.... Had trial counsel informed] Movant of this plea offer Movant would not have proceeded] to trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b947-13\">Chisolm\u2019s memorandum supporting his motion alleges that his attorney never informed him of the plea offer the memorandum describes. A defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to the effective assistance of counsel extends to counsel\u2019s obligation to communicate the terms of a plea offer to his client. <em>Padilla v. Kentucky, </em>559 U.S. 356, 130 S.Ct. 1473, 176 L.Ed.2d 284 (2010). All the record contains about counsel\u2019s performance is the statement in the memorandum Chisolm filed in support of his motion: \u201ctrial counsel failed to inform Movant of the government plea offer before he went to trial.\u201d And that in exchange for a plea of guilty, he would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"936\">*936</page-number>receive \u201ca lesser sentence than life in prison.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b948-4\">A claim such as Chislom\u2019s is judged under the two-part <em>Strickland </em>test.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>Hill v. Lockhart, </em>474 U.S. 52, 57, 106 S.Ct. 366, 88 L.Ed.2d 203 (1985). <em>Missouri v. Frye, </em>566 U.S. -, -, 132 S.Ct. 1399, 1405, 182 L.Ed.2d 379 (2012). Since, other than Chisolm\u2019s allegation, the record is silent as to defense counsel\u2019s performance, we assume for sake of argument that Chisolm has established the first prong of <em>Strickland </em>\u2019s test, deficient performance, <em>see Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 688-89, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 2065, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984); counsel failed to inform him of the government\u2019s offer. The question thus becomes whether Chisolm satisfied <em>Strickland\u2019s </em>prejudice prong. In the context the instant case presents, <em>Missouri v. Frye </em>instructs that a prisoner must show that (1) but for his counsel\u2019s ineffective assistance there was a \u201creasonable probability\u201d he would have, pled guilty, (2) the court would have accepted the plea, and (3) \u201ca reasonable probability that the end result of the criminal process would have been more favorable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at -, 132 S.Ct. at 1409.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-12\">Chisolm\u2019s reply to the government\u2019s response to his motion is that he would have accepted a mandatory life sentence in exchange for a plea of guilty and a promise to cooperate \u2014 the same deal Bolware got. He represents that he \u201cwould have done whatever the Government wanted him to do.\u201d That, of course, would involve identifying his cocaine suppliers and the scores of individuals with whom he trafficked cocaine and crack during the more than ten years before he got into business with Bolware,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> appearing before the grand jury, and then testifying at'the trials of any who were indicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-13\">Bolware and Kimball entered into a Plea and Cooperation Agreement with the government on June 30, 2008, six months before Chisolm stood trial. The agreements were a matter of public record.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Chisolm surely anticipated that they would provide the government with voluminous information about his drug trafficking enterprise and then testify against him at his trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"937\">*937</page-number>Bolware and Kimball were sentenced on October 1, 2008, three months before Chi-solm\u2019s trial began. Bolware received a mandatory life sentence. Chisolm knew that the cooperation Bolware had provided the government prior to that date was insufficient to prompt the government to move the District Court pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3558(e) to impose a sentence below the statutorily mandated life sentence. Bolware would have to do more, including testifying at Chisolm\u2019s trial, before the government would move the District Court to reduce his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-5\">Chisolm and his lawyer surely discussed Bolware\u2019s situation and the substantial assistance he would have to provide the government if he entered into a Plea and Cooperation Agreement like Bolware\u2019s and Kimball\u2019s. Noticeably absent from the Reply Memorandum Chisolm filed in response to the government\u2019s Opposition to Motion to Vacate is a statement that Chi-solm told his lawyer that he wanted the same deal Bolware received, but his lawyer ignored his demand. What the record does contain is Chisolm\u2019s \u201cafter the fact testimony\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> \u2014 his initial statement, that he wanted to plead in exchange for a lesser than life sentence, and his second statement (given that the government never agreed to a lesser than life arrangement), that he wanted to plead in exchange for a mandatory life sentence and the government\u2019s promise to seek at some time in the future a Rule 35(b) reduction of sentence for all the substantial assistance he would provide.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-6\">In sum, Chisolm\u2019s memoranda in support of his motion and in reply to the government\u2019s opposition do not, considered in the light of the record in this case, establish <em>Strickland\u2019s </em>prejudice prong, as expressed in <em>Missouri v. Frye, </em>that but for his counsel\u2019s ineffective assistance there is a \u201creasonable probability\u201d that he would have agreed to a mandatory life sentence in exchange for the government\u2019s promise to seek a sentence reduction based on his substantial cooperation.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> If his convictions were vacated and, like Bolware, he pled guilty to the conspiracy charge, he would be sentenced to a mandatory term of life imprisonment \u2014 in effect, the sentence that is now in place. After he saw the sentence Bolware' received notwithstanding his cooperation \u2014 mandatory life \u2014 any thoughts Chisolm may have had about pleading guilty ceased.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b945-9\">. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Bolware, </em>Case No. 5:08-00022 (N.D.Fla.)
