The district court ruled that it lacked jurisdiction to consider Fields\u2019s petition. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 2241, 2255(e), We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-22\">In 1996, a federal jury convicted Fields of one count of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute cocaine and cocaine base, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1), 846, one count of possession with intent to distribute cocaine base, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 841(a)(1), one count <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"864\">*864</page-number>of conspiracy to launder money, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 1956(h), and seven counts of laundering money with the intent to promote \u201cthe manufacture, importation, receiving, concealment, buying, selling or otherwise dealing in a controlled substance\u201d and \u201cknowing that the transactions were designed in whole or in part to conceal and disguise the nature, location, source, ownership and control of the proceeds of ... [the] specified unlawful activity,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 1956(a)(l)(A)(i), (a)(l)(B)(i). The district court sentenced Fields to imprisonment for life for conspiring to distribute cocaine, <em>id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1), 846, and to nine terms of 240 months of imprisonment for his possession of cocaine and money laundering offenses. The district court ordered that Fields\u2019s sentences run concurrently.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-4\">Fields appealed his convictions and his sentence. <em>United States v. Wiggs, </em>20 Fed.Appx. 128 (4th Cir.2001). The Fourth Circuit affirmed Fields\u2019s convictions summarily and concluded that he was not prejudiced by an error in his sentence. <em>Id. </em>at 130-31.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-5\">In 2002, Fields filed a motion to vacate his convictions, which the district court denied. The district court rejected as baseless Fields\u2019s arguments that his counsel was ineffective for failing to contest his convictions for money laundering. Counsel, the district court explained, moved for a judgment of acquittal during trial and argued \u201c[o]n direct appeal ... that the Government failed to prove [Fields] intended to further the criminal activity out of which the proceeds were derived\u201d and \u201cthat there was no evidence to suggest he attempted to \u2018conceal the nature, location, source, ownership or control\u2019 of the proceeds.\u201d Fields also moved to alter or amend the judgment, Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(e), and for relief from the judgment, Fed. R.Civ.P. 60(b), but the district court denied both motions. The Fourth Circuit denied Fields\u2019s request for a certificate of appeal-ability.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-7\">In 2010, Fields petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241. Fields argued that the Supreme Court in <em>Cuellar v. United States, </em>553 U.S. 550, 128 S.Ct. 1994, 170 L.Ed.2d 942 (2008), had narrowed the definition of the word \u201cdesigned\u201d in the money laundering statute, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1956(a), to the point that his conduct was not punishable under the statute. The district court dismissed the petition on the grounds that Fields\u2019s argument did not fall \u201cwithin the \u2018savings clause\u2019 of \u00a7 2255(e)\u201d and \u201c[i]nstead challenge^] the validity of his sentence\u201d and that, \u201cto the extent [he] assert[ed] the same arguments previously considered by the sentencing court and the Court of Appeals, the claims ... [were barred by] <em>res judicata.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b876-8\">We review <em>de novo </em>whether a prisoner may petition for a writ of habeas corpus \u201cunder the savings clause of \u00a7 2255(e).\u201d <em>Bryant v. Warden, FCC Coleman-Medium, </em>738 F.3d 1253, 1262 (11th Cir.2013) (quoting <em>Williams v. Warden, Fed. Bureau of Prisons, </em>713 F.3d 1332, 1337 (11th Cir.2013)). \u201cWe can ... \u2018affirm the judgment of the district court on any ground supported by the record, regardless of whether that ground was relied upon or even considered by the district court, <em>Kernel Records Oy v. Mosley, </em>694 F.3d 1294, 1309 (11th Cir.2012).\u2019 \u201d <em>Williams, </em>713 F.3d at 1341 n. 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-9\">New federal prisoners are entitled to pursue relief under the savings clause. A federal prisoner may petition for habeas corpus relief under section 2241 only if his previous motion to vacate was \u201cinadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2255(e), 2241. To proceed, the federal prisoner must prove that his claim is based on a decision of the Supreme Court that is retroactively applicable; that decision establishes he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"865\">*865</page-number>was convicted of a nonexistent offense; and circuit precedent squarely foreclosed his claim at trial, on appeal, and in his previous motion for postconviction relief. <em>Wofford v. Scott, </em>177 F.3d 1236, 1244 (11th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b877-15\">The district court did not err by dismissing Fields\u2019s petition. Circuit precedent did not \u201csquarely foreclose\u201d Fields\u2019s challenge to his convictions for money laundering. In <em>Cuellar, </em>the Supreme Court held that the word \u201cdesigned\u201d in the money laundering statute requires the government to prove \u201cthat the purpose \u2014 not merely [the] effect \u2014 of the transportation was to conceal or disguise\u201d the source or ownership of the money. 553 U.S. at 567, 128 S.Ct. at 2005. But the Fourth Circuit already had imposed a similar requirement on the government in prosecuting cases involving money laundering. \u201cTo prove a case under section 1956(a)(l)(B)(i) or (ii) [when Fields was convicted], \u2018the government [had to] prove that the transaction was designed to conceal one or another of the enumerated attributes of the proceeds involved.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Gilliam, </em>975 F.2d 1050, 1056 (4th Cir.1992); <em>see, e.g., United States v. Hairston, </em>46 F.3d 361, 374 (4th Cir.1995). And Fields argued on direct appeal that there was insufficient evidence to suggest-why he moved the proceeds of the conspiracy. Because Fields was able earlier \u201cto test the legality of his detention,\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(e), the district court lacked jurisdiction to entertain his petition for a writ of habeas corpus. <em>See Williams, </em>713 F.3d at 1339-40.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-16\">Fields argues that he did not have to satisfy the savings clause to pursue habeas corpus relief under section 2241, but he acknowledges that argument is foreclosed by our precedent. In <em>Williams, </em>we held that the savings clause limits the subject matter jurisdiction of the district court to entertain a petition for a writ of habeas corpus under section 2241. <em>Id. </em>[Ujnder this Court\u2019s prior-panel-precedent rule, \u2018a prior panel\u2019s holding is binding on all subsequent panels unless and until it is overruled or undermined to the point of abrogation by the Supreme Court or by this court sitting <em>en banc.\u2019 </em>\u201d <em>In re Lambrix, </em>776 F.3d 789, 794 (11th Cir.2015) (quoting <em>United States v. Archer, </em>531 F.3d 1347, 1352 (11th Cir.2008)).</p>\n<p id=\"b877-13\">We AFFIRM the dismissal of Fields\u2019s petition for a writ of habeas corpus.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
