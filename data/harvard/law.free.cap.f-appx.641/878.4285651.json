The issues presented in this case concern whether William Lewis\u2019 habeas petition is barred by that provision. As stated in the certificate of appealability (COA) issued by the district court, those issues are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b891-17\">1. Whether - [Lewis\u2019] mental impairments entitle him to equitable tolling sufficient to render his habeas petition timely filed;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b891-18\">2. Whether [Lewis\u2019] resentencing on June 28, 2006 [to correct a clerical error in his original sentence] affects the computation of the one-year federal limitations period; [and]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b891-19\">3. Whether [Lewis] is entitled to the benefit of the 90-day period for seeking certiorari review in the United States Supreme Court with respect to his state court judgment of conviction even though he did not seek certiorari review in the Georgia Supreme Court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b892-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"880\">*880</page-number>Our answers to those questions are: no; it doesn\u2019t matter; and no.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-5\">A jury in Murray County, Georgia convicted Lewis of rape and aggravated sodomy, among other crimes. On March 26, 2003, the Murray County Superior Court sentenced him to concurrent life terms, under O.C.G.A. \u00a7 17-10-7(a) and (c), for rape and aggravated sodomy. The written judgment containing Lewis\u2019 sentences incorrectly indicated that the court imposed the sentence for the aggravated sodomy conviction under O.C.G.A. \u00a7 17-10-6.1, and it did not specify the subsections of \u00a7 17-10-7 under which the court imposed the sentence for the rape conviction. On February 22, 2005, the Georgia Court of Appeals affirmed Lewis\u2019 convictions and sentences on direct appeal. Lewis did not petition the Georgia Supreme Court for certiorari.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-6\">On June 6, 2005, Lewis filed his state habeas petition in Gwinnett County Superior Court. That court denied that petition on April 19, 2006, but issued a limited remand to the trial court to correct the \u201cclerical errors\u201d in the written judgment: the judgment\u2019s citation of \u00a7 17-10-6.1 as the basis for the aggravated sodomy sentence and its failure to specify which subsections of \u00a7 17-10-7 were the basis for the rape sentence. Before the trial court had corrected his sentence, Lewis applied to the Georgia Supreme Court for a certificate of probable cause (CPC) and filed with the clerk of the Gwinnett County Superior Court a notice of appeal of the denial of his state habeas petition. While his application was pending, on June 28, 2006, the trial court corrected Lewis\u2019 sentence to reflect the proper statutory citations. The Georgia Supreme Court denied his application for a CPC on November 6, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-7\">Lewis filed his federal habeas petition on October 23, 2007. The warden of the facility where he was incarcerated moved to dismiss the petition on the ground that it was -untimely under AEDPA\u2019s one-year limitations period. Lewis offered a number of reasons why his petition should be considered timely, including the three that are reflected in the issues specified in the COA.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-8\">As to the first certified issue: Lewis\u2019 mental impairments do not entitle him to equitable tolling. They do not because he has failed to show that they prevented him from timely filing his petition. To avail himself of equitable tolling, a habeas petitioner must show \u201c(1) that he has been pursuing his rights diligently, and (2) that some extraordinary circumstance stood in his way and prevented timely filing.\u201d <em>Holland v. Florida, </em>560 U.S. 631, 649, 130 S.Ct. 2549, 2562, 177 L.Ed.2d 130 (2010). The district court\u2019s finding that Lewis\u2019 mental impairments did not prevent him from timely filing his federal habeas petition is a factual finding which we review only for clear error. <em>See San Martin v. McNeil, </em>633 F.3d 1257, 1265 (11th Cir.2011). A finding is clearly erroneous if a reviewing court is left with a \u201cdefinite and firm conviction\u201d that the finding is wrong. <em>Branch v. Sec\u2019y, Fla. Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>638 F.3d 1353, 1356 (11th Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b892-9\">The record shows that despite his asserted impairments Lewis was generally capable of doing the sort of work necessary to file a habeas petition. For example, Dr. William Schneider testified that, notwithstanding Lewis\u2019 mental illness, he was able to write letters, fill out simple forms, and draft short rebuttals to disciplinary charges in prison. He further testified that Lewis was aware of his legal problems and showed an interest in pursuing his rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"881\">*881</page-number>Lewis\u2019 conduct at the state habeas hearing also supports the conclusion that, despite his mental impairments, he could have timely filed his petition had he been reasonably diligent. Representing himself at the hearing, Lewis demonstrated an understanding of his claims and at least some ability to impeach opposing witnesses, including his trial counsel, Jerry Moncus. Although Lewis was sometimes confused, he was for the most part able to articulate his disagreements with Moncus and question him about those disagreements. Throughout his state and federal habeas litigation, Lewis also demonstrated an awareness of deadlines and an ability to respond to them in a timely manner. And, as Lewis testified during the federal habe-as proceedings, he had finished the eleventh grade, obtained his GED, and could read and write. For all of these reasons, we are not left with the \u201cdefinite and firm conviction\u201d that the district court erred in finding that Lewis\u2019 mental impairments prevented him from filing his federal habe-as petition on time.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-5\">Lewis contends that his case is materially indistinguishable from <em>Hunter v. Ferrell, </em>587 F.3d 1304 (11th Cir.2009), in which we vacated the denial of a \u00a7 2254 petition because the petitioner presented sufficient evidence to create a genuine issue of material fact as to the existence of a causal link between his mental impairment and his ability to timely file a federal habeas petition. The comparison to <em>Hunter </em>is inapt because Lewis\u2019 impairments are substantially less severe than Hunter\u2019s were. Unlike Hunter, Lewis is literate, has received his GED, and has never been deemed intellectually , disabled. Likewise, although one doctor opined that Lewis struggles to express his thoughts in a clear and organized manner, Lewis is better able to intelligibly express himself than Hunter was. Finally, although Lewis, like Hunter, relied on the assistance of other inmates for his post-conviction filings, the record demonstrates that, unlike Hunter, Lewis understands his legal rights sufficiently that he could have filed his federal habeas petition on time. All of those facts materially distinguish this case from <em>Hunter.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b893-7\">Holding the second COA issue in abeyance for the time being, the third one is: \u201cWhether [Lewis] is entitled to the benefit of the 90-day period for seeking certiorari review in the United States Supreme Court with respect to his state court judgment of conviction even though he did not seek certiorari review in the Georgia Supreme Court.\u201d AEDPA\u2019s limitations period runs from \u201cthe date on which the judgment became final by the conclusion of direct review <em>or the expiration of the time for seeking such review.\u201d </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(A) (emphasis added). United States Supreme Court Rule 13(1) says that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b893-8\">Unless otherwise provided by law, a petition for a writ of certiorari to review a judgment in any case, civil or criminal, entered by a state court of last resort ... is timely when it is filed with the Clerk of this Court within 90 days after entry of the judgment. A petition for a writ' of certiorari seeking review of a judgment of a lower state court that is subject to discretionary review by the state court of last resort is timely when it is filed with the Clerk within 90 days after entry of the order denying discretionary review.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b893-9\">The upshot is that, for purposes of AED-PA\u2019s limitations period, when a party petitions a \u201cstate court of last resort\u201d to review a judgment by a lower state court, the time for seeking review of the judgment expires 90 days after the state court of last resort either enters its judgment or enters an order denying discretionary re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"882\">*882</page-number>view. And with the expiration of that time AEDPA\u2019s limitations period begins to run.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-4\">Lewis interprets Supreme Court Rule 13(1) to mean that AEDPA\u2019s statute of limitations did not begin to run until 90 days after the Georgia Court of Appeals affirmed his convictions. That argument fails because, by its terms, Rule 13(l)\u2019s 90-day period for seeking United States Supreme Court certiorari review applies only to parties who have sought to have the judgments against them reviewed by a state court of last resort, Lewis does not fit that description. The Georgia \u201cstate court of last resort\u201d is the Georgia Supreme Court, <em>Pugh v. Smith, </em>465 F.3d 1295, 1300 (11th Cir.2006), and Lewis never petitioned that court to review his convictions or sentences. Accordingly, he was never eligible to petition the United States Supreme Court for certiorari review and is not entitled to benefit from the 90-day reprieve from the running of the limitations period that would have applied if he had been eligible.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-5\">Lewis suggests that Georgia Supreme Court Rule 40 effectively makes the Georgia Court of Appeals the court of last resort, but he is wrong. Rule 40 simply provides that certiorari review by the Georgia Supreme Court is discretionary, and that, for purposes of Georgia law, a state prisoner is deemed to have exhausted all available state remedies once the Georgia Court of Appeals has ruled on his appeal. <em>See </em>Ga. Sup.Ct. R. 40.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Nothing in the rule strips the Georgia Supreme Court of jurisdiction to review direct appeals by Georgia state prisoners. It remains the highest state court in-which a decision on a Georgia criminal conviction may be had \u2014 in other words, it remains the \u201cstate court of last resort.\u201d As a result, if Lewis wanted to petition the United States Supreme Court for certiora-ri review of the judgment against him, he first had to petition for review by the Georgia\u2019s highest court. Because he did not do so, the 90-day period that United States Supreme Court Rule 13(1) provides for filing a petition for a writ of certiorari in that Court does not affect the finality of the judgment against him, Georgia Supreme Court Rule 40 notwithstanding.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-8\">We turn now to the second issue-in the COA: \u201cWhether [Lewis\u2019] resentencing on June 28, 2006 [to correct clerical errors in his original sentences] affects the computation of the one-year federal limitations period.\u201d We need not resolve that issue because our resolution of it would not affect the outcome of this appeal. <em>See Otero v. United States, </em>499 F.3d 1267, 1269 n. 1 (11th Cir.2007). Even were we to agree with Lewis\u2019 argument, his federal habeas petition would have been due by July 28, 2007, a year after the end of the 30-day period for appealing his amended sentence from the trial court to the Georgia Court of Appeals. Lewis did not file his federal habeas petition until October 2007. It is untimely regardless of how we would decide the second issue specified in the COA.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-9\">Finally, Lewis contends that, because his state habeas appeal was pending when the sentencing court amended his judgment, the sentencing court lacked jurisdiction to amend the judgment or take any other action in his criminal case. As a result, he argues, there is still no valid sentence in his case, which means AED-PA\u2019s limitations period has not even begun to run. Our review in habeas cases is limited to the issues certified for appeal. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"883\">*883</page-number><em>See McCoy v. United States, </em>266 F.3d 1245, 1248 n. 2 (11th Cir.2001). Because Lewis\u2019 argument about the validity of the amended sentence in his case is not among the issues in the COA, we do not consider it.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b894-6\">. Rule 40, which provides the standard for certiorari review by the Georgia Supreme Court in criminal cases, is not to be confused with Georgia Supreme Court Rule 36, which provides the standard for granting review by that court \"in a habeas corpus case involving a criminal conviction.\"</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
