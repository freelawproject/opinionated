Smallwood and the Government both challenge the sentence. Small-wood asserts the sentence is procedurally and substantively unreasonable, while the Government argues the sentence must be vacated because the district erroneously found that two of Smallwood\u2019s prior convictions are not separate offenses under 18 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"912\">*912</page-number>U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We agree with the Government. Therefore, we vacate and remand for resentencing. This decision moots the issues raised by Smallwood in his appeal, and we consequently limit our discussion to the Government\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b924-5\">A person who violates \u00a7 922(g)(1) and has three prior convictions for a \u201cviolent felony or a serious drug offense, or both, <em>committed on occasions different from one another </em>.,. shall be .., imprisoned not less than fifteen years.\u201d 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 924(e)(1) (emphasis added). Smallwood has three prior convictions that arguably meet the definition of \u201cviolent felony.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> However, the district court did not consider whether the convictions are violent felonies, because it concluded that two of the convictions \u2014 two burglary convictions to which Smallwood pled guilty \u2014 -were not \u201ccommitted on occasions different from one another.\u201d <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b924-6\">In determining whether Smallwood committed the burglaries on separate occasions, the district court had the authority to consider Smallwood\u2019s indictments and plea hearing transcript for the convictions.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>See Shepard v. United States, </em>544 U.S. 13, 16, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 1257, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005) (\u201c[a] court determining the character of an admitted burglary is generally limited to examining the statutory deftnition, charging document, written plea agreement, transcript of plea colloquy, and any explicit factual finding by the trial judge to which the defendant assented\u201d); <em>Weeks, </em>711 F.3d at 1259. These documents provide the following information about the burglaries: Smallwood and two accomplices burglarized two fast-food restaurants; the restaurants were located in the same strip mall and were directly adjacent to each other; the group burglarized the restaurants during the same trip to the strip mall; and one of the accomplices waited in a car while Smallwood and the other accomplice entered the restaurants. In addition, at the plea hearing for the burglaries, the trial court asked Smallwood if he personally entered both restaurants, and Smallwood responded affirmatively. Similarly, the accomplice who waited in the car during the burglaries testified at the plea hearing that Smallwood.and the other accomplice each went into both restaurants.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-10\">' Based on this information, the district court determined that Smallwood and one accomplice personally entered both restaurants.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The court also found that Small-wood committed the burglaries in \u201cimmediate succession.\u201d After making these findings, the court concluded that the burglaries are not separate offenses under \u00a7 924(e)(1). Accordingly, the court held Smallwood has at most two prior qualify<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"913\">*913</page-number>ing convictions under \u00a7 924(e)(1) and is not eligible for \u00a7 924(e)(l)\u2019s sentencing enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-18\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b925-19\">We review de novo whether a defendant\u2019s offenses constitute separate offenses under \u00a7 924(e)(1), and we review for clear error the district court\u2019s findings of fact related to the imposition of sentencing enhancements. <em>United States v. Lee, </em>208 F.3d 1306, 1307 (11th Cir.2000) (per curiam); <em>United States v. Ghertler, </em>605 F.3d 1256, 1267 (11th Cir.2010). Moreover, in reviewing the district court\u2019s decision, we must consider that \u201c[t]he burden of establishing evidence of the facts necessary to support a sentencing enhancement falls on the government, and it must do so by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d <em>United States v. Perez-Oliveros, </em>479 F.3d 779, 783 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b925-21\">M t-H HH</p>\n<p id=\"b925-15\">Smallwood\u2019s burglary convictions constitute separate offenses under \u00a7 924(e)(1). \u201cSuccessful completion of one crime plus a subsequent conscious decision to commit another crime makes that second crime distinct from the first for the purposes of the ACCA.\u201d <em>United States v. Pope, </em>132 F.3d 684, 692 (11th Cir.1998) (internal quotation marks omitted). In other words, *\u2018[s]o long as predicate crimes are successive rather than simultaneous, they constitute separate criminal episodes for purposes of the ACCA,\u201d <em>Id, </em>\u201cDistinctions in time and place are usually sufficient to\u201d render two offenses successive, \u201ceven when the gaps are small, and two offenses are considered distinct if some temporal break occurs between them.\u201d <em>Weeks, </em>711 F.3d at 1261 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b925-5\">Here, the district court reviewed Small-wood\u2019s <em>Shepard </em>documents, addressed the documents at the sentencing hearing, and concluded that Smallwood personally entered and burglarized two different fast-food restaurants in \u201cimmediate succession.\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Although the restaurants were in extremely close proximity to each other and Smallwood committed one burglary \u201cimmediately\u201d after the other, the critical fact is that he committed the burglaries in succession. <em>See id, </em>Thus, the Government met its burden of showing by a preponderance of the evidence that Smallwood\u2019s burglaries were \u201ccommitted on occasions different from one another.\u201d <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1); <em>Weeks, </em>711 F.3d at 1261.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b925-7\">Given our finding that Smallwood\u2019s burglary convictions qualify as separate offenses under \u00a7 924(e)(1), we vacate Smallwood\u2019s sentence and remand for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-8\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b924-7\">. Section 924(e) of Title 18 is commonly known as the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b924-8\">. We note that the issue of whether Small-wood\u2019s prior convictions actually constitute violent felonies was not briefed by the parties or considered by the district court. As such, this issue is not before us. <em>See Iraola &amp; CIA, S.A. v. Kimberly-Clark Corp., </em>325 F.3d 1274, 1284-85 (11th Cir.2003) (\"It is the general rule ... that a federal appellate court does not consider an issue not passed upon below.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b924-11\">.

In addition to Smallwood\u2019s <em>Shepard </em>documents, the district court relied on a fact of which it took judicial notice. The fact is related to the physical location of the restaurants. The parties do not challenge this finding.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b925-16\">. Smallwood contests these findings. But, we conclude that they are not clearly erroneous in light of the information in Smallwood's <em>Shepard </em>documents.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
