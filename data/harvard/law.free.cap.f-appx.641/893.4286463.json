Palm Beach Cty. Sheriff Dep't, </em>783 F.3d 1347, 1352 (11th Cir.2015).</p>\n<p id=\"b906-14\">Elliott, an officer in the Florida Army National Guard, lives in a neighborhood located in a subdivision in St. Johns County, Florida. A grassy trail runs between Elliott\u2019s neighborhood and another neighborhood in the subdivision. The subdivision owns the trail, but a power company has an easement across it to run power lines. The trail is located underneath those power lines.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-15\">Elliott was walking his dog along that trail when he encountered Richard Wilcox, a Florida Wildlife Conservation Commission (FWC) officer, who was out on patrol. Wilcox was patrolling the trail because he had received information from the power company and a local hunting club about trespassers in that area. He also saw a \u201cNo Trespassing\u201d sign as he entered the trail. Wilcox believed that the power company owned the trail and that Elliott did not have permission to be there.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-16\">Wilcox informed Elliott that he was patrolling for the power company and that Elliott was trespassing on its land. Elliott replied that he was not trespassing because the subdivision owned the land and had put up the \u201cNo Trespassing\u201d signs. Wilcox continued to insist that Elliott was trespassing and asked for his identification. Elliott refused to give him his identification because he did not realize that Wilcox was a law enforcement officer. As he began to walk away, an intern in Wilcox\u2019s truck alerted Wilcox that Elliott was apparently wearing an Army Combat Unifc-ACU holster underneath his jacket. Wilcox asked Elliott if he was carrying a weapon. Elliott replied that he was and Wilcox demanded his concealed carry permit, which Elliott refused to produce. After Elliott continued walking away toward his home, Wilcox called his supervisor, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"895\">*895</page-number>Lieutenant Benjamin Allen, to report the encounter.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-5\">As Elliott neared his home, Wilcox drove up alongside him and again asked for his identification. Elliott once again refused. When he got home he put his weapon away (he does not specify where he put it) and called the St. Johns County Sheriffs Office and the subdivision security service to report the encounter.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-6\">The Sheriffs Office dispatched Officers Ermon Bentley and Kerry Tanner to the subdivision in response to Elliott\u2019s call. Bentley and Tanner went to the subdivision, where they met with Wilcox. Wilcox told them that he had encountered someone trespassing on the trail, that the person had a gun, and that he had refused to give Wilcox his identification. Wilcox took Bentley and Tanner to the trail, where he showed them the \u201cNo Trespassing\u201d signs. Bentley and Tanner, like Wilcox, believed that the power company owned the land.All three officers then proceeded to Elliott\u2019s home (Wilcox obtained Elliott\u2019s address from the subdivision\u2019s security guards).</p>\n<p id=\"b907-7\">Bentley and Tanner arrived first. They met Elliott and his wife outside his front door and began to discuss the encounter between Elliott and Wilcox. They also patted down Elliott and did not find a weapon. Wilcox arrived at Elliott\u2019s home during that discussion, left his vehicle, and began to move toward the front porch. Wilcox told Elliott that he was under arrest, and either Bentley or Tanner told him to put his hands behind his back. Elliott, who was holding his cell phone, then took his phone, hit the emergency unlock, began to turn around, handed the phone to his wife, told his wife to call his boss, and then put his hands behind his back. Bentley and Tanner quickly moved to restrain Elliott. They slammed him into a column on the front porch and then pushed him down onto the concrete driveway, while repeatedly yelling at him to \u201cstop resisting.\u201d One of them put his knee into Elliott\u2019s back, put Elliott\u2019s hands behind his back, handcuffed him, lifted him up, and put him into the squad car. He was taken to the county jail, booked, and charged with armed trespass on property other than a structure, in violation of Fla. Stat. \u00a7 810.09(2)(c), and resisting an officer without violence, in violation of Fla. Stat. \u00a7 843.02. He was released the next day and the charges were dropped.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-10\">After his release, Elliott went to the hospital and was treated for cuts and bruises along his head and shoulder. He did not need stitches. He was also diagnosed with a chip fracture of the bone in his left arm and event-specific Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-11\">Elliott filed a complaint under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 against Wilcox, Allen, Bentley, and Tanner.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He alleged that all of them had falsely arrested him and conspired to violate his civil rights. He also alleged that Bentley and Tanner had used excessive force when arresting him. The district court granted the defendants\u2019 motions for summary judgment, finding that they were entitled to qualified immunity on the false arrest claims and that Bentley and Tanner did not use excessive force (and, even if they did, qualified immunity applied). The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"896\">*896</page-number>court also concluded that Elliott did not present sufficient evidence to defeat summary judgment on his conspiracy claim.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b908-4\">Elliott contends that the district court erred in granting summary judgment to the defendants on his false arrest and excessive force claims. He has abandoned his conspiracy claim because he failed to raise that issue in his initial brief. <em>See Sapuppo v. Allstate Floridian Ins. Co., </em>739 F.3d 678, 680-82 (11th Cir.2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b908-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-6\">\u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>a grant of summary judgment.\u201d <em>Mobley, </em>783 F.3d at 1352. The purpose of qualified immunity \u201cis to allow government officials to carry out their discretionary duties without the fear of personal liability or harassing litigation, protecting from suit all but the plainly incompetent or one who is knowingly violating the federal law.\u201d <em>Lee v. Ferraro, </em>284 F.3d 1188, 1194 (11th Cir.2002) (quotation marks and citation omitted). \u201cBecause qualified immunity is a defense not only from liability, but also from suit, it is important for a court to ascertain the validity of a qualified immunity defense as early in the lawsuit as possible.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b908-7\">To obtain qualified immunity, the defendants must show that they were acting within their discretionary duty. <em>Mobley, </em>783 F.3d at 1362. There is no dispute that they were. To overcome qualified immunity, Elliott must establish (1) that the defendants violated his constitutional rights and (2) that \u201cthe law clearly established those rights at the time of the alleged misconduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1352-53 (quotation marks omitted). \u201cWe may address those two inquiries in either order.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b908-10\">A. FALSE ARREST</p>\n<p id=\"b908-11\">Elliott first argues that Wilcox, Bentley, Tanner, and Allen wrongfully arrested him. An arrest made without probable cause violates the Fourth Amendment. <em>Kingsland v. City of Miami, </em>382 F.3d 1220, 1232 (11th Cir.2004). Probable cause exists if \u201cthe facts and the circumstances within the collective knowledge of the law enforcement officials, of which they had reasonably trustworthy information, are sufficient to cause a person of reasonable caution to believe that an offense has been ... committed.\u201d <em>Madiwale v. Savaiko, </em>117 F.3d 1321, 1324 (11th Cir.1997) (quotation marks omitted). An officer is \u201centitled to qualified immunity if there was arguable probable cause for the arrest.\u201d <em>Kingsland, </em>382 F.3d at 1232. Arguable probable cause exists if \u201creasonable officers in the same circumstances and possessing the same knowledge as the [defendants could have believed that probable cause existed\u201d for the arrest. <em>Von Stein v. Brescher, </em>904 F.2d 572, 579 (11th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b908-12\">Reasonable officers in the defendants\u2019 shoes could have believed that probable cause existed to arrest Elliott for armed trespass. Florida law provides that a \u201cperson who, without being authorized, licensed, or invited, willfully enters upon or remains in any property other than a structure or conveyance\u201d as to which \u201cnotice against entering or remaining is given ... by posting ... as described [under Florida law]\u201d commits the \u201coffense of trespass on property other than a structure or conveyance.\u201d Fla. Stat. \u00a7 810.09(l)(a)(l). That person is guilty of a third degree <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"897\">*897</page-number>felony if he is armed during the commission of that offense. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 810.09(2)(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b909-5\">Wilcox saw a \u201cNo Trespassing\u201d sign at the entrance to the trail, which gave him reasonable grounds to believe that Elliott was trespassing. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 810.12 (\u201cThe unauthorized entry by any person into or upon any enclosed and posted land shall be prima facie evidence of the intention of such person to commit an act of trespass.\u201d). Contrary to Elliott\u2019s argument, it is irrelevant that the sign did not precisely comply with Florida\u2019s requirements for \u201cNo Trespassing\u201d signs. <em>See Hutton v. Strickland, </em>919 F.2d 1531, 1541 (11th Cir.1990) (\u201cIn making probable cause decisions, law enforcement officers are not charged with knowing legal technicalities and nuances, but with the factual and practical considerations of everyday life on which reasonable and prudent men, not legal technicians, act.\u201d) (quotation marks omitted). Whatever Elliott knew regarding who owned the land, or what he told Wilcox about his right to be on the trail, is also irrelevant because Wilcox believed that the power company owned that land and that Elliott was not allowed to walk the trail. <em>See Jones v. Cannon, </em>174 F.3d 1271, 1283 n. 4 (11th Cir.1999) (\u201c[W]hat counts -for qualified immunity purposes relating to probable cause to arrest is the information known to the defendant officers ... at the time of their conduct, not the facts known to the plaintiff then or those known to a court later,\u201d); <em>see also Hutton, </em>919 F.2d at 1542 (noting that we do not hold \u201carresting officers to knowledge of property law in determining probable cause\u201d). Finally, Elliott does not dispute that he told Wilcox that he was armed.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-8\">Based on all of those facts, Wilcox had arguable probable cause to arrest Elliott for armed trespass. <em>See id. </em>at 1539-41 (concluding that officers had probable cause to arrest the plaintiffs for trespass under Florida law where the property was posted with a \u201cNo Trespassing\u201d sign and the officers believed that the plaintiffs did not own the property). It follows that Allen, Bentley, and Tanner also had arguable probable cause for the arrest because they could rely on information that Wilcox gave them about his encounter with Elliott. <em>See Madiwale, </em>117 F.3d at 1324; <em>see also Voorhees v. State, </em>699 So.2d 602, 609 (Fla.1997) (\u201cThe fellow officer rule allows an arresting officer to assume probable cause to arrest a suspect from information supplied by other officers.\u201d). The court correctly granted summary judgment on the false arrest claims.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b909-9\">B. EXCESSIVE FORCE</p>\n<p id=\"b909-10\">Elliott next argues that Bentley and Tanner used excessive force when arresting him. The Fourth Amendment \u201cencompasses the right to be free from excessive force during the course of a criminal apprehension.\u201d <em>Mobley, </em>783 F.3d at 1353 (quotation marks omitted). Bentley and Tanner are entitled to qualified immunity unless Elliott can show that \u201cthe law clearly established that [the] particular amount of force\u201d they used was excessive. <em>Lee, </em>284 F.3d at 1198.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-11\">To show that the law was clearly established, Elliott must identify a \u201cmaterially similar case that has already decided that what the [defendants were] doing was un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"898\">*898</page-number>lawful.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation marks omitted). There is a \u201cnarrow exception\u201d to that rule. <em>Priester v. City of Riviera Beach, </em>208 F.3d 919, 926 (11th Cir.2000). If Elliott can show that Bentley and Tanner\u2019s conduct \u201clies so obviously at the very core of what the Fourth Amendment prohibits that the unlawfulness of the conduct was readily apparent to [them], notwithstanding the lack of caselaw,\u201d then they are not entitled to qualified immunity. <em>Id. </em>(quotation marks omitted). Under the general rule and narrow exception, \u201cpre-existing law must dictate, that is, truly compel (not just suggest or allow or raise a question about), the conclusion for every like-situated, reasonable government agent that what the [defendants were] doing violate[d] federal law\u201d to overcome qualified immunity. <em>Id. </em>at 927 (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b910-4\">The only case Elliott points to as materially similar is <em>Smith v. Mattox, </em>127 F.3d 1416 (11th Cir.1997). <em>Smith </em>was a \u201cvery close case\u201d in which the plaintiff was \u201cbarely\u201d able to overcome qualified immunity. <em>Id. </em>at 1419. The officer told the plaintiff to \u201cget down,\u201d and after he \u201cdocilely submitted to arrest\u201d the officer broke his arm while handcuffing him. <em>Id. </em>at 1418. Elliott, however, did not \u201cdocilely\u201d submit to arrest after he was told to put his hands behind his back \u2014 he took his phone, pressed a button on it, gave it to his wife, and then put his hands behind his back. <em>See id. </em>at 1420 (stating that the suspect was \u201coffering no resistance <em>at all\u201d). </em>The <em>Smith </em>opinion emphasizes that the plaintiff had suffered a broken arm that required surgery for multiple fractures. <em>Id. </em>at 1418, 1420. That injury is more severe than Elliott\u2019s injuries, and it indicates that a greater degree of force was involved in the <em>Smith </em>case. Because the <em>Smith </em>case is not materially similar to the present case, it does not clearly establish that Bentley and Tanner used excessive force. <em>See id, </em>at 1419 (\u201c[If] case law, in factual terms, has not staked out a bright line, qualified immunity almost always protects the defendant.\u201d) (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b910-6\">Nor can Elliott show that every reasonable officer in Bentley and Tanner\u2019s position would have known that the force was unlawful. <em>Priester, </em>208 F.3d at 926-27. Their conduct was not egregious enough to be \u201cso far beyond the hazy border between excessive and acceptable force that [they] had to know [they were] violating the Constitution even without caselaw on point.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 926 (quotation marks omitted); <em>cf. Oliver v. Fiorino, </em>586 F.3d 898, 907-08 (11th Cir.2009) (denying qualified immunity where the officers tasered an un-resist-ing person \u201cat least eight and as many as eleven or twelve times over a two-minute span,\u201d even though he was \u201cwrithing in pain on the hot pavement and .., had gone limp,\u201d because that force was \u201cso plainly unnecessary and disproportionate that no reasonable officer could have thought\u201d it was lawful); <em>Priester, </em>208 F.3d at 923 n. 1, 927-28 (denying , qualified immunity because \u201cno reasonable officer\u201d could have believed it was. lawful for an officer to order a 94-pound German Shepard to attack, unprovoked, a person suspected of stealing $20 in snacks from a golf shop who immediately submitted to arrest, and let that attack continue for at least two minutes while threatening to kill the person when he resisted). The district court did not err in granting summary judgment to Bentley and Tanner on Elliott\u2019s excessive force claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b907-8\">. Elliott also listed St, Johns County Sheriff David B. Shoar as a defendant, alleging \u00a7 1983 claims against him for municipal liability for false arrest and excessive force and Florida common law claims for false imprisonment and battery. The district court granted Shoar's motion for summary judgment on the \u00a7 1983 claims and dismissed the Florida claims without prejudice. Because Elliott does not mention those claims in his initial brief, he has abandoned them. <em>See Sapuppo v. Allstate Floridian Ins. Co., </em>739 F.3d 678, 680-82 (11th Cir.2014).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b908-8\">. Elliott also moved for partial summary judgment on the \u00a7 1983 false arrest claims. The district court denied that motion as well.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b909-6\">. Because the defendants had arguable probable cause to arrest Elliott for armed trespass, we need not address the district court\u2019s findings (or the parties\u2019 contentions) about whether the defendants also had arguable probable cause to arrest Elliott for other crimes. <em>See Welding Servs., Inc. v. Forman, </em>509 F.3d 1351, 1356 (11th Cir.2007) (\"This court may affirm on any ground supported by the record.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
