Under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(a)(5) of the 2010 Guidelines Manual, Escobar\u2019s base offense level was set at 34 because the offense involved at least 3 kilograms but less than 10 kilograms of heroin. After a two-level enhancement, pursuant to \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l), because a dangerous weapon was possessed, a three-level role enhancement, pursuant to \u00a7 3Bl.l(b), and a three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, pursuant to \u00a7 3E1.1, Escobar\u2019s total offense level was 36. Based on a total offense level of 36 and a criminal history category of II, his advisory guideline range was 210 to 262 months. At sentencing, the district court applied a downward variance at the parties\u2019 req\u00faest and sentenced Escobar to 168 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-6\">In April 2015, Escobar moved to reduce his sentence based on Amendment 782 to the Sentencing Guidelines, which lowered the base offense levels for most drug offenses. The district court denied Esco-bar\u2019s motion, stating that Escobar was ineligible for a sentence reduction because the application of Amendment 782 would only reduce his guideline range to 168 to 210 months, and his original 168-month sentence was at the bottom of that amended guideline range.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-7\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s legal conclusions about the Sentencing Guidelines and the scope of its authority under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>United States v. Liberse, </em>688 F.3d 1198, 1200 n. 1 (11th Cir.2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b873-8\">A district court may modify a term of imprisonment in the case of a defendant who was sentenced to \u00e1 term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Amendment 782 reduced by 2 levels the base offense levels that apply to most drug offenses, including offenses involving at least 3 but less than 10 kilograms of heroin. U.S.S.G. App. C, Amend. 782 (2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b873-10\">A district court must follow a two-step process in ruling on a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. <em>United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 780 (11th Cir.2000). At the first step, the court must recalculate the defendant\u2019s sentence by substituting the amended guideline range for the originally applied guideline range. <em>Id. </em>At this step, all other guideline application decisions made during the original sentencing remain intact. <em>Id.; see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(b)(l) (stating that the court must substitute only the relevant amendment into the court\u2019s original guideline calculations, and must \u201cleave all other guideline application decisions unaffected\u201d). To be eligible for a reduction, the relevant amendment must lower the defendant\u2019s \u201capplicable guideline range,\u201d which is \u201cthe guideline range that corresponds to the offense level and criminal history category determined pursuant to \u00a7 lBl.l(a), which is determined before consideration of any departure provision in the Guidelines Manual or any variance.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, comment. (n.l(A)); <em>see also Bravo, </em>203 F.3d at 781 n. 5 (stating that a decision to depart downward from the original guideline range is not a guideline application decision that remains intact when the court considers the new guideline range). At the second step, the court must decide whether, in its discretion and in light of the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors, to retain the original sentence or to resentence the defendant under the amended guideline range. <em>Bravo, </em>203 F.3d at 781.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-11\">Unless a defendant\u2019s original term of imprisonment was imposed below the ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"862\">*862</page-number>plicable guideline range pursuant to a motion to reflect the defendant\u2019s substantial assistance to the government, the district court may not reduce the sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) to a term that is below the amended guideline range. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(b)(2)(A)-(B); <em>United States v. Colon, </em>707 F.3d 1255, 1259 (11th Cir.2013); see <em>also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, comment, (n.3) (stating that the exception only applies to reductions based on substantial assistance following a government motion under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(e), or Fed.R.Crim.P. 35(b)).</p>\n<p id=\"b874-4\">A district court may apply a variance and impose a sentence outside of the advisory guideline range if it finds that a variance is justified under the sentencing factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>United States v. Kapordelis, </em>569 F.3d 1291, 1316 (11th Cir.2009). Guided departures, which are departures specifically provided for in the Sentencing Guidelines, also permit a district court to impose a sentence outside of the advisory guideline range. <em>United States v. Gibson, </em>434 F.3d 1234, 1252 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b874-5\">Here, the district court did not err in denying Escobar\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. Escobar was ineligible for a sentence reduction because Amendment 782 would only reduce his guideline range to 168 to 210 months, and he originally received a 168-month sentence and was not sentenced below the applicable guideline range pursuant to a substantial assistance motion. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(b)(2)(A)-(B); <em>Colon, </em>707 F.3d at 1259. To calculate the amended guideline range, Amendment 782 is substituted for the 2010 version of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1, reducing the base offense level from 34 to 32. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. App. C, Amend. 782 (2014); <em>see also Bravo, </em>203 F.3d at 780; U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(b)(l). Applying the same enhancements and reductions that were applied at the original sentencing hearing \u2014 a two-level enhancement because a dangerous weapon was possessed, a three-level role enhancement, and a three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility \u2014 produces a new total offense level of 34. <em>See Bravo, </em>203 F.3d at 780; U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(b)(l). Thus, based on a new total offense level of 34 and a criminal history category of II, Escobar\u2019s amended guideline range is 168 to 210 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-8\">The district court\u2019s decision to impose a variance at the original sentencing hearing does not impact the calculation of the amended guideline range. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, comment. (n.l(A)). Although at one point during the hearing the parties described the variance as a reduction in the offense level, the parties stated that the presentence investigation report had correctly calculated the guideline range at 210 to 262 months; the government stated that the variance or reduction was based upon the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors; and the court found that Esco-bar\u2019s 168-month sentence served the objectives of \u00a7 3553(a). <em>See Kapordelis, </em>569 F.3d at 1316. Even if Escobar were correct in his contention that the agreed-upon reduction was a guided departure rather than a variance, the result is unaffected, because a departure is not a guideline application decision that remains unaffected and is part of the applicable guideline range. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, comment. (n.l(A)) and (n.3); <em>Bravo, </em>203 F.3d at 781 n. 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-9\">AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b874-6\">.
