Johnson contends that the evidence presented at trial was insufficient to establish that he possessed knowingly a firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-7\">We review <em>de novo </em>the denial of a motion for judgment of acquittal based on sufficiency of the evidence, \u201cconsidering the evidence in the light most favorable to the Government, and drawing all reasonable inferences and credibility choices in the Government\u2019s favor.\u201d <em>United States v. Capers, </em>708 F.3d 1286, 1296 (11th Cir.2013). \u201cWe will not reverse unless no reasonable trier of fact could find guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>United States v. Farley, </em>607 F.3d 1294, 1333 (11th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b888-8\">Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the government, sufficient evidence exists from which a reasonable juror could conclude that Johnson was guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. At trial, a police officer testified that he saw Johnson holding a handgun with an extended magazine and saw Johnson make a \u201ctossing motion\u201d with the hand that held the gun. The jury was entitled to believe the officer\u2019s testimony and, because the officer\u2019s testimony was not \u201cincredible as a matter of law,\u201d we are bound by the jury\u2019s credibility determination. <em>See United States v. Calderon, </em>127 F.3d 1314, 1325 (11th Cir.1997) (\u201c[C]redibility determinations are the exclusive province of the jury.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b888-9\">The officer\u2019s testimony was sufficient by itself for a reasonable juror to conclude that Johnson possessed knowingly a firearm. In addition, the officer\u2019s testimony was corroborated by other evidence presented at trial, including evidence that (1) a handgun matching the officer\u2019s description was found in the area where Johnson was seen making a \u201ctossing motion;\u201d (2) a mixture of DNA, including Johnson\u2019s DNA type, was found on the handgun; and (3) Johnson\u2019s cell phone contained recent photographs of Johnson holding a firearm with an extended magazine. On this record, sufficient evidence exists to sustain Johnson\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-11\">Johnson next contends that the district court erred in enhancing his base offense level, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(l). Johnson argues \u2014 on appeal and for the first time \u2014 that his earlier state convictions for resisting an officer with violence and for possessing cannabis with intent to sell constituted no \u201ccrime of violence\u201d or \u201ccontrolled substance offense\u201d for purposes of section 2K2.1(a)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b888-12\">Johnson concedes that his argument is foreclosed by this Court\u2019s decisions in <em>United States v. Romo-Villalobos, </em>674 F.3d 1246, 1249 (11th Cir.2012) (concluding that a Florida conviction for resisting an officer with violence constitutes a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under the guidelines), and <em>United States v. Smith, </em>775 F.3d 1262, 1268 (11th Cir.2014) (concluding that a conviction under Fla. Stat. \u00a7 893.13(1) is a \u201ccontrolled substance offense\u201d under the guidelines). Thus, Johnson cannot show that the district court plainly erred in applying a sentencing enhancement under section 2K2.1(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b888-13\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-14\">Johnson also challenges both the procedural and substantive reasonableness of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"877\">*877</page-number>his sentence. He contends that his sentence is unreasonable procedurally because the district court calculated improperly his guidelines range. Johnson next argues that his sentence is unreasonable substantively because the district court failed to consider adequately certain mitigating factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-5\">We review the reasonableness of a final sentence under a deferential abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 128 S.Ct. 586, 591, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). The party challenging the reasonableness of the sentence bears the burden of establishing that the sentence is unreasonable in the light of both the record and the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b889-6\">In reviewing a sentence, we first examine whether the district court committed a significant procedural error, such as calculating improperly the guidelines range, failing to consider the section 3553(a) sentencing factors, basing the sentence on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to explain adequately the chosen sentence. <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597. After we have determined that a sentence is procedurally sound, we review the sentence\u2019s substantive reasonableness under the totality of the circumstances. <em>Id. </em>A sentence substantively is unreasonable if it \u201cfails to achieve the purposes of sentencing as stated in section 3553(a).\u201d <em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 788.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-8\">About procedural reasonableness, Johnson argues that the district court calculated improperly his guidelines range. We have already rejected \u2014 as foreclosed by this Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Romo-Villalobos </em>and in <em>Smith </em>\u2014 Johnson\u2019s argument that the district court enhanced improperly Johnson\u2019s base offense level. Given Johnson\u2019s total offense level of 28 and his criminal history category of III, the district court calculated properly Johnson\u2019s sentencing range as between 97 and 120 months\u2019 imprisonment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Johnson has failed to demonstrate that his sentence is unreasonable procedurally. .</p>\n<p id=\"b889-9\">Johnson has also not shown that his 120-month sentence was substantively unreasonable. First, Johnson\u2019s sentence was within the applicable guidelines; we ordinarily expect such a sentence to be reasonable. <em>See Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 788.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-10\">In determining Johnson\u2019s sentence, the district court considered expressly the section 3553(a) factors, Johnson has an extensive criminal history \u2014 beginning when Johnson was ten years\u2019 old \u2014 including convictions for drug offenses, attempted murder, and for resisting officers with and without violence. The district court expressed concern about Johnson\u2019s \u201cnonstop history\u201d of violent criminal activity. The district court also noted that, although Johnson had received relatively lenient . treatment for many of his past crimes (most of which were nolle prossed, dismissed, or resulted in no action), Johnson had continued to \u201cviolate the laws in a very troubling way.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b890-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"878\">*878</page-number>On appeal, Johnson argues that the district court failed to accord sufficient weight to certain mitigating factors. The district court considered expressly Johnson\u2019s relationship with his then-five-year-old son and Johnson\u2019s drug addiction. The district court also reviewed and adopted the findings of fact in the Presentence Investigation Report, which d\u00e9scribed Johnson\u2019s attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and which recognized that Johnson grew up without a father. Having considered Johnson\u2019s history and characteristics \u2014 including this mitigating evidence \u2014 the district court was within its discretion to conclude that the mitigating factors were outweighed by other factors, such as the need to protect the public, promote respect for the law, and to deter future criminal conduct. <em>See United States v. Williams, </em>526 F.3d 1312, 1322 (11th Cir.2008) (\u201c[t]he weight to be accorded any given \u00a7 3553(a) factor is a matter committed to the sound discretion of the district court.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b890-4\">Given the record, we cannot say that the 120-month sentence failed to reflect the purposes of sentencing or that the district court committed \u201ca clear error of judgment in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors by arriving at a sentence that lies outside the range of reasonable sentences dictated by the facts of the case.\u201d <em>See United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1203 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b890-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b889-7\">. Under section 3553(a), a district court should consider the nature and circumstances of the offense, the history and characteristics of the defendant, the need for the sentence to provide adequate deterrence, respect for the law, and protection of the public, policy statements of the Sentencing Commission, provision for the medical and educational needs of the defendant, and the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(l)-(7).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b889-12\">. Although Johnson\u2019s guidelines range was calculated initially as between 97 and 121 months' imprisonment, the upper end of the sentencing range was capped at 120 months: the statutory maximum sentence for Johnson\u2019s offense.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
