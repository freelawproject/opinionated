He then charged $2,800 on these farms for the widow, during widowhood, apportioning the charge, and then provided that the balance of the valuation should be divided between his four children. He then provided as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b551-4\">\u201c I do order that my hereinafter named executors shall with the one-fourth part, or the said Elias\u2019 share, purchase a property at some convenient place, for the use of said Elias during his natural life, and after his death to go to his lawful heirs.\u201d Testator further ordered that, at the death or termination of widowhood of his wife, the $2,800 should be paid and divided among his four children. He then provided: \u201c I do further order my hereinafter named executors to put Elias\u2019 share to interest or purchase some property for his use, subject to the same conditions as above.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b551-5\">A codicil was added as follows: \u201c To explain- more fully respecting of son Elias\u2019s inheritance. It is my will, and I do order that my said son, Elias, is to have equal share, as above stated, and that executors are to be and act as trustees of him, the said Elias, he only to receive the income of the premises (yearly and every year during his natural lifetime), which the said executors are to purchase for his use, and, after his decease, to go to his lawful heirs.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b551-6\">The widow refused to take under the will, and her statutory dower was fixed and charged on the land by agreement of the parties. Elias died before the widow. This dower is the fund for distribution.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b551-7\">The auditor, William D. Weaver, distributed the fund as personalty, to the whole and half blood. Jacob E. Becker, appellant, the only heir of the whole blood, excepted that it should have been distributed to him as realty. The court, Livingston, P. J., dismissed the exceptions and confirmed the report. Exceptant then appealed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b552-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number><em>Errors assigned </em>were to such distribution.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b552-5\"><em>S.

If it is personal estate, it is conceded the distribution, made by the learned auditor, and approved by the court below, is right. The doctrine of conversion, as stated by Justice Williams in McClure\u2019s Appeal, 72 Pa. 414, is undoubtedly the rule in Pennsylvania : \u201c The rule is well settled that land directed to be converted into money, or money into land, is to be regarded in equity as that species of property into which one or the other is so directed to be converted; and this rule obtains whether the direction is given by deed or will. But the direction to convert must be positive and explicit, irrespective of all contingencies and independent of all discretion.\u201d We do not think the will of John Becker, Sr., contains a positive and explicit direction to convert. While in one portion of the will there is a direction to the executors, who are also the trustees of Elias, to purchase a property at some convenient place for his use during his natural life, there is also the direction in another part of the will \u201cto put Elias\u2019s share to interest or purchase a property for his use.\u201d This would seem to leave an option with the trustees. In point of fact, they did not purchase a property for his use. His share remained money in fact, and was so distributed after his death. In this we see no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-9\">The decree is affirmed, and the appeal dismissed at the costs of the appellant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
