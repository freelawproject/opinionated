A successor was elected but the old principal continued to act. The trustees obtained an injunction to restrain the discharged principal from assuming to exercise the office. <em>Held:</em></syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b104-12\">1. The action of the trustees in convicting the principal of immorality, and discharging him, without notice or hearing, was irregular and unjust, and, if no other considerations were presented than such as were personal to the trustees and the principal, the injunction would be dissolved.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b104-13\">2. The fact, however, that the school year is near its close, and the probability that greater harm would result to the school and to the public service .from disturbing the injunction at this time than <em>from </em>sustaining it, will induce the court to let the injunction stand so far as it enjoins <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>against interference with the authority or functions of the new principal, or the management of the school.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b105-4\">3.

J., Sterrett, Williams, McCollum and Heydrick, JJ.</judges>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b105-8\">The bill, after setting forth the origin of the school, etc., alleged that defendant was not regularly employed as principal of the school because the yeas and nays had not been called by the board of trustees, and that he was dismissed, Feb. 5, 1891, by the action of the board, on account of immorality and negligence. The minutes of the board, made a part of the bill, showed the alleged immoral conduct to be the mis-, appropriation of books, moneys, etc., and deception as to the distribution of classes among teachers, etc. The bill further alleged that defendant refused to vacate the position, and continued to act as principal. Defendant\u2019s answer admitted the truth of the last allegation, but denied the charge of immorality and alleged that he had received no notice from the board that he had been charged with any of the offences, asking that the injunction be dissolved.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b105-9\">The court refused the motion to dissolve the injunction, in the following opinion, by Gunnison, P. J.:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b105-10\">[\u201c The defendant, in his answer, and by the multitude of affidavits presented by him in support of this motion, has at great length denied all the charges contained in the plaintiff\u2019s bill, excepting the material one that he has been dismissed from the position held by him, by the action of the trustees of the school, had at a regular meeting, the reasons assigned therefor being sufficient in law.] [10] The defendant admits that fact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>in his answer, but alleges that the dismissal was unlawful for the reason that the charges of immorality and negligence made against him are untrue; that he had no opportunity to disprove them, and that they were the result of a conspiracy entered into for the purpose of effecting his removal, by members of the board of trustees who were hostile to him. [The truth of the charges cannot be investigated in this proceeding. The board of trustees is the tribunal authorized by law to determine that question, and within the limits prescribed by the Act of Assembly their action is final.] [8] [Having determined the charges to be true, it was in their discretion to remove the defendant.] [9] -This court has no appellate jurisdiction to review their decision. [Their action may have been unjust, impolitic and even malicious; it may have been in total disregard of the true interests of the school; the defendant may have been wrongfully dismissed; but, rightfully or wrongfully, he was dismissed; and when, in defiance of the authority of the trustees, he persisted in the attempt to retain the position, he was acting contrary to law.] [7]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b106-5\">\u201c What redress he may have against the plaintiffs for the malicious exercise of their authority, it is not necessary to inquire here. This is not the proper proceeding, and no competent evidence has been offered upon which to determine that question. -</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b106-6\">[\u201cI entertain no doubt as to the jurisdiction of this court to grant an injunction in this case.] [4] [It is not the case of two individuals, each claiming the right to an office, the facts upon which the right depends being in dispute.] [5] [Here the material fact is undisputed. There is no issue of fact to be determined. Upon the admitted fact the trustees dismissed the defendant at a regular meeting, assigning sufficient reasons, and observing all the formalities required by law, it must be held that his persisting in officiating as principal afterwards, entering upon the grounds, into the halls and class-rooms of the school for that purpose, were acts of trespass, for the prevention of which there was no adequate remedy at law, thus presenting a case peculiarly one for equitable intervention.] [6] The distinction between it and the cases cited on behalf of the defendant upon the question of jurisdiction, is obvious.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b106-7\">\u201c The importance to the school of a speedy decision, and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>lack of time, precludes the preparation of a more lengthy opinion, and an extended reference to the authorities, which are numerous.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b107-4\"><em>Errors assigned </em>were (1-3) granting, continuing and refusing to vacate preliminary injunction, quoting motions and orders ; (4-10) opinion of court below as indicated by brackets, quoting them and alleging that paragraphs 6, 7, 9, 10, cited from the opinion, were wrong in their conclusions both as to facts and law; (11) granting the injunction and refusing to dissolve the same, quoting the writ.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b107-5\"><em>8.

L. 471, requiring the yeas and nays to be called, is a supplement to the Common School Act of May 8, 1854. The law creating and governing the normal school system was passed in 1857. There is nothing in the decisions or subsequent legislation making the Act of 1862 applicable to normal schools. Dyberry School Dist. v. Mercer, 115 Pa. 559; Cascade School Dist. v. Lewis School Dist., 43 Pa. 318, and Dennison School Dist., v. Padden, 89 Pa. 397, all arise from common school and not from normal school districts.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b107-6\">McCrea v. School Dist. 145 Pa. 550, and Whitehead v. School Dist., 145 Pa. 418, are authority for the position that where a school board acts in bad faith or abuses its powers of dismissal under the Act of 1854, such action is illegal and void. The board of trustees of a normal school was clothed with the same power of dismissal by the Act of 1885, P. L. 175. The above cases therefore rule this contention against the trustees, and for this reason alone the court should have dismissed the injunction.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b107-7\">Where the plaintiff\u2019s right is doubtful, a preliminary injunction will not be granted. The right must be clear or it will be refused: Harkinson\u2019s Ap., 78 Pa. 196; Waring v. Cram, 1 Pars. 516; Biddle v. Ash, 2 Ash. 211; Moore v. Ry., 3 Phila. 210; Cooper v.

Besides, like all other cases of disputed right, it is subject to the rule that an injunction will not be granted until the question of right is settled in a court of law: Gilroy\u2019s Ap., 100 Pa. 5 ; Brown\u2019s Ap., 62 Pa. 17; Minnig\u2019s Ap., 82 Pa. 373; Hagner v.

If such is the law, any teacher may commit acts of negligence and immorality and defy the directors by pleading not guilty and alleging bad faith on the part of the directors. As a fact, the power of the trustees is quasi-judicial and, when exercised in due form of law, must be final: McCrea v. School Dist., supra; Whitehead v. School Dist., supra. These cases decide that the charge of bad faith can be asserted only in an action for wages or damages.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b109-4\">The remedy by injunction is peculiarly adapted to this case; Kerr v. Trego, 47 Pa. 292; Early\u2019s Ap., 121 Pa. 510; Bierbauer\u2019s Ap., 107 Pa. 17.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b109-5\">Hagner v.

Justice Williams,</author>\n<p id=\"b109-8\">The appellant had been for many years the principal of the State Normal School of the 12th District of Pennsylvania, located at Edinboro in the county of Erie. On July 3, 1891, he was regularly re-elected by the trustees to the same position. When the work of the school year began he was in his place discharging the duties devolving on him as principal without objection. On Feb. 5, 1892, the trustees adopted and spread at length on their minutes a resolution dismissing him from his position because of immoral conduct, which they specified in four distinct charges set out in the resolution; A few days later they elected his successor, and on the 18th of the same month they served him with the bill in this case and notice that an injunction would be moved for on the 22d. On that day a preliminary injunction was issued, commanding him \u201c to cease assuming the position of principal of said school, and to desist from further trespassing on the premises or interfering with the authority of the trustees.\u201d The motion to dissolve was subsequently refused, and the injunction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>continued. The appellant was thus summarily ejected from his position about the middle of the year for which he had been regularly elected. When he asked for a reason for such treatment he was pointed to his conviction upon four distinct charges of immoral conduct spread upon the minutes of the board of trustees. When he denied the regularity of such action a court of equity was appealed to by the trustees to close his mouth and tie his hands. He comes into this court by appeal, and asks whether he may be lawfully tried, convicted and sentenced without so much as notice that he is accused ?</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">A good character is a necessary part of the equipment of a teacher. Take this away, or blacken it, and the doors of professional employment are practically closed against him. Before this is done there should be at least a hearing, at which the accused may show that the things alleged are not true, or if true are susceptible of an explanation consistent with good morals and his own professional fidelity. We think it is plain, too plain for serious discussion, that the action of the trustees was irregular and unjust to the appellant. If no other considerations presented themselves than such as are personal to the trustees and the appellant, we should not hesitate to dissolve the injunction; but the State Normal School and its work are also entitled to consideration. The school year is near its close. Another principal has conducted its affairs since Feb. 9, and is in accord with the trustees. The appellant cannot hope for a re-election. In view of what has transpired, including his own conduct prior to the granting of the injunction, it is doubtful if his re-election would be helpful to him or the school.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">It is often the duty of a chancellor to consider the consequences of a decree he is asked to make, and to withhold it where greater harm might result from making than from denying it. No appreciable good could result from the dissolution of this injunction at this time in the school year, and under existing circumstances. Great harm to an important institution, under the care of the state, might result from such a decree. Having regard to the public interests involved we shall leave the injunction to stand so far as it enjoins against interference with the authority or functions of the new principal, or the management of the school. If i'fc be thought to have any wider scope or pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>pose, it is as to such purpose dissolved. This decree is made with a saving of all rights of the appellant to proceed at law for the collection of his salary for the remainder of the year.-</p>\n<p id=\"Aa8\">The costs of this appeal to be paid by the appellee.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
