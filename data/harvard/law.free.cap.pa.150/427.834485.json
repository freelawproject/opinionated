We now propose to ask him, on this cross-examination, whether or not, prior to removal of this fence in 1889, Edward Parr\u2019s heifer was not in his corn on a Sunday, and whether or not he, the plaintiff, and one William Grove, did not, together with other people, put her out.

That his father, George Zinn, procured Jesse D. Keller, a surveyor of the neighborhood, to come there and make a survey of the property now claimed by the plaintiff. That the witness was one of the chain carriers at that survey. That they started to survey at the line between Parr and Geo. Zinn, and ran down to the pike south to the lane in controversy. That they ran this line twice and drove a stake, which was about 18 inches or 2 feet inside of the fence on the property now claimed by Kennedy. That his father, Geo. Zinn, said to Mr. Keller, the surveyor, is this a straight line ?\u2014(referring to the line along the lane) and Mr. Keller, after examination, said it was. That bis father then looked out along the line and shook his head, and with an oath said, \u201c It is an awful crooked one,\u201d or words to that effect. That Karl Erdman, the defendant, was present. Erdman then said to George Zinn, \u201c This fence (referring to the fence along the property now claimed by Kennedy) is not on the line.\u201d That his father turned around and said to Erdman, \u201c Well, shall I set her in ? \u201d Mr. Erdman said no, not now but when we make a new fence, then put it back on the line, or words to that effect. To be followed by evidence that the plaintiff, Daniel Kennedy, had full notice of this prior to his purchase of his property. And to be followed further that removal of the fence by the defendant was in pursuance of this arrangement.

Offer overruled, exception. [4]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b456-4\">The defendant now proposes to prove the facts stated in the last preceding offer, that in connection therewith Jesse D. Keller, the surveyor, mentioned in the last offer, did run a line along this lane back as far as the rear of the property claimed by the plaintiff, and that line fell north of all the fence torn down by the defendant. That, when the surveyor and the chain carriers reached the rear end of the property now claimed by the plaintiff, he sent John M. Zinn, who was one of the chain carriers, to the eastern end of the line at the pike, and had directed him to set stakes over there to the western end of the property claimed by the plaintiff, where the surveyor then was. That Geo. Zinn looked through the instrument and sighted the poles, and that the fence torn down by the plaintiff fell south of that line. That at that point at the western end of the property now claimed by the plaintiff, Geo. Zinn again said to surveyor Keller, \u201c Does it call for a straight line ? \u201d That the parties, the surveyor, Keller, Geo. Zinn and John M. Zinn, the chain carrier, went back to the corner of Geiselman\u2019s woods. That Mr. Keller said, \u201c We will get a straight line pretty soon.\u201d That Mr. Keller took his compass and sighted through. That John M. Zinn then went up and sighted through the instrument and he saw the two stakes in line with the instrument. George Zinn, the predecessor in title of the plaintiff, then looked through the instrument. That he scratched his head and said, \u201c Stop a minute, is that a straight line ? \u201d Keller said, \u201c Look again.\u201d Then he looked the second time and said, \u201c Is my fence so crooked?\u201d Then he said to Erdman, \u201cDo you want me to tear up my fence and set it on the line ? \u201d Erdman said, \u201c No, we are good friends, let us remain good friends; leave it until the fence gets worse and then we will make it right.\u201d That the fence at the rear was about 2 feet on Erdman\u2019s land, and that in front at the pike it was about 2 feet on Erdman\u2019s land. To be followed by evidence that the defendant tore down no more fence than what fell south of this line, (line run by Keller that day,) and from which Geo. Zinn and John M. Zinn sighted the poles. To be followed by evidence that Kennedy, the plaintiff, knew these facts before his purchase. For the purpose of sustaining the defendant\u2019s plea of not guilty, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>and showing that there was a compromise line and the location of it agreed upon by Karl Erdman and Geo. Zinn, the then adjoining owners, and in mitigation of damages. Offer overruled and exception. [5]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b457-5\">The defendant now proposes to prove the facts stated in the last two preceding offers, and in addition that a short time subsequent to this survey made by Keller, Karl Erdman, the defendant, and Jefferson Bollinger, were driving down the Baltimore pike, past Mount Olivet cemetery, where Geo. Zinn was then living. That Zinn came out on the pike and hailed them and stopped them, and that there was a conversation between Erdman and Zinn, which was begun by Zinn, in reference to the line and fence in controversy. Zinn in that conversation asked Erdman if he wanted him to tear the fence down right away and make a new one, or words to that effect, and Mr. Erdman said, \u201c No,\u201d he could wait until the fence got worse and then they would put up a new fence. That Mr. Zinn would make half of the fence and Mr. Erdman the other half. That there was a chestnut tree that stood on Erdman\u2019s land near to this fence, and that Zinn asked Erdman if he would allow him to have this tree for the purpose of temporarily repairing the fence, and that Erdman told him he could have it for that purpose. That in this conversation they also spoke about a lane, and that they agreed that when they made the fence they would also close up the lane.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b457-6\">To be followed by evidence that the lane and the fence which George Zinn and Karl Erdman were talking about, was the lane and fence in controversy. For the purpose of showing that there was at that time a controversy about the lane and fence in question between the defendant and Geo. Zinn, the plaintiff\u2019s predecessor in title. That a new and compromised line was agreed upon between Geo'. Zinn and the defendant, which line fell north of the fence torn down by the defendant. For the purpose of showing a breach of the continuity of the plaintiff\u2019s alleged prescriptive right to use the lane in controversy, and for the purpose of sustaining the defendant\u2019s plea of not guilty, and that the fence was allowed to remain as it stood, and the lane to be used thereafter under license of Karl Erdman, and for all the purposes mentioned in the two preceding offers, and that the plaintiff, Daniel Kennedy, had notice of all these facts prior to his purchase.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b458-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>The Court: I think the offer must be overruled for the reasons stated in overruling the former offers.

They are not triable together: Specht v. R. R., 7 C. C. 54.

Chief Justice Paxson,</author>\n<p id=\"b460-10\">Litigation about line fences is one of the most expensive luxuries known to the law. This case is not an exception to the rule. The fence in controversy divided the property of the plaintiff from that of defendant, Karl Erdman. It appears to have been an old fence, and to have been standing on the same line for a long period of time, perhaps. fifty years. For <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>some reason the defendant, Erdman, became dissatisfied with its location, alleging, as we understand it, that in some places it encroached upon him as much as two feet. Assuming to decide the law and the facts in his case in his own favor, he took down the fence, and placed the rails and posts on the land of the plaintiff. The jury took a different view of the matter, and returned a verdict against the defendants of -$504 damages, with costs of suit. When to the damages are added the costs, counsel fees, and the expense of printing a paper-book of one hundred and sixty-four pages, we may safely say that controversies of this kind are a luxury.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">The jury evidently took a liberal view of the damages, as their verdict is $4 in excess of the plaintiff\u2019s claim, as set forth in their statement of their cause of action. This excess of \u00a74 was remitted by the plaintiffs below upon an intimation from the court that if it was not done, a new trial wmuld be granted. Had the learned judge gone further, and reduced the verdict by at least one half, it would have done no violence to the justice of the case. The verdict is not only compensatory, but highly punitive. In view of this fact, we would gladly help the defendants if we could do so in accordance with the recogonized rules of law. A careful examination of the voluminous record, however, fails to disclose any error which would justify us in reversing the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">The first specification alleges that the court erred in making the order of November 15,1890, directing a certified copy of the record to be served on David Baughman, to which Karl Erdman, defendant, excepted. This order grew out of an amendment of the record changing the name of a party defendant. The suit as originally brought was against Karl Erdman and Jacob Baughman. At some stage of the proceedings the plaintiff discovered that Jacob Baughman was not the defendant he wanted, but that David Baughman was the person who assisted in taking down the fence. He accordingly obtained permission to amend the record by substituting the name of David for that of Jacob. It was not a mistake in the name, but a mistake in the man. The next difficulty that presented itself was that David Baughman had not been served with process and was not in court. The plaintiff therefore obtained the order complained of, and had it served with, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>certified copy of the record upon David. The defendant, Erdman, excepted to this order. David Baughman did not except because he was not in court and could not except. Why Erdman excepted does not appear. It could do him no harm to have a co-defendant added in a case of trespass to assist him in paying the damages. However irregular this proceeding, it was cured by David\u2019s coming into court, and taking part in the trial as a party defendant. We do not regard this matter as important, and it is referred to only that it may not be supposed we have overlooked it.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-4\">It is difficult to see any substantial objection to the evidence referred to in the second specification. The object of it was to show malice and ill-will on the part of the defendants, and that the trespass was wanton and aggravated, for the purpose of enhancing the damages. Aside from this, the specification is not assigned in accordance with the rules of court.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">We are unable to see the relevancy of defendant\u2019s offer of evidence, as contained in the third specification. The defendants proposed to ask the plaintiff upon cross-examination \u201c whether or not prior to the removal of this fence in 1889, Edward Parr\u2019s heifer was not in his corn on a Sunday and whether or not he, the plaintiff, and one William Grove did not go with other people and put her out, for the purpose of contradicting, and in mitigation of damages.\u201d We do not understand how the fact that Parr\u2019s heifer was in the plaintiff\u2019s corn on a Sunday could operate in mitigation of damages; and as it had no possible relevancy to the issue, the plaintiff could not have been contradicted, if he had denied it.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">The fourth, fifth and sixth specifications may be considered together, as they all relate to the same subject. They refer to an offer of evidence, varied somewhat in each specification, to show that about 1870 a compromise line had been run by a surveyor. The offers are too voluminous to be repeated. If admitted, they would have been insufficient to establish the line, and would not be evidence for that purpose. Nor do we think they were competent in mitigation of the damages. The most that the proposed evidence amounted to was loose conversations between defendant, Erdman, and plaintiff\u2019s predecessor in the title. They amounted to little, and were never acted upon. In view of the fact of plaintiff\u2019s evidence, which, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>upon this point, we do not understand to have been seriously contradicted, that a fence had existed, been kept up and maintained where this one stood for about half a century, that plaintiff and those under whom he claimed, had been in the open, peaceable and exclusive possession of the land, and had cultivated it up to that fence, with the uninterrupted use of the lane or alley in connection with his place during all that time; and in view of the further fact that the defendants were remonstrated with, prior to taking down the fence, and yet proceeded to do so with a strong hand, we do not think this loose conversation, which occurred twenty years ago, entitled, to any weight upon the question of damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-4\">We find no error in the refusal of the defendant\u2019s first point. The learned judge instructed the jury that upon the first two counts the verdict should be for the defendant, but left them to find a verdict for the plaintiff on the third count. The third count referred to was for demolishing the fence. We do not know of any reason why a verdict for the plaintiff could not have been rendered upon this count: Erie City Iron Works v. Barber, 118 Pa. 19; Chapin v. Cambria Iron Works, 145 Id. 498.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">By the defendant\u2019s second point the court was asked to instruct the jury that there could not be a verdict for vindictive or punitive damages. This point was properly refused. To have affirmed it under the evidence would have been error. .</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
