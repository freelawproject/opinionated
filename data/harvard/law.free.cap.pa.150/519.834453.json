The court below sustained this contention upon the authority of White v. Crawford, 84 Pa. 433; Tomlinson\u2019s Appeal, 90 Pa. 224, and other cases. We need not discuss the question how far the authorities cited by the learned judge sustain his position. Upon the merits the order was properly refused. We do not think it was a case for the application of the Act of 1876. The assignor had no legal interest in the real estate in question. He had at most an equitable interest and that was small. It was alleged, and not denied, that the liens upon the equitable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>title far exceeded any amount the assignor\u2019s interest would bring at an assignee\u2019s sale. Under these circumstances, the order would merely have substituted the assignee for the sheriff as the agent of the law to make said sale, without benefiting any one, unless it be the assignee himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-4\">The decree is affirmed, and the appeal dismissed at the costs of the appellant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
