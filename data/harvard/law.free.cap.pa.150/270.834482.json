J.: The title to the realty on which the buildings insured were located was in Mrs. Diffenbaugh. On March 31, 1875, she had a certificate of the court entitling her to her separate earnings. On April 3,1875, she constituted her husband her agent to carry on the business of butchering on the premises. All the contents, named in the policy, belonged to her.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b296-18\">Plaintiff then offered in evidence the policy in suit, covering property of Henry Diffenbaugh, but the court rejected it.

That just before the insurance was effected, he, through the same agents, effected insurance of other real estate of his wife, the policies for which were written in her name, that neither witness nor his wife knew that these agents had written the policy in suit in his name, instead of in her name, until after the fire and loss.\u201d [3]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b297-5\">Objected to and disallowed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b297-6\">The court refused to allow plaintiff to answer the following questions: \u201c Did you authorize your husband, at the time this policy was- taken out, to insure in this company and to take out this policy ? \u201d [4]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b297-7\">Also the following question : \u201c Did your husband take out this policy, and did you know at the time your husband did take out this policy ? \u201d [5]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b297-8\">The court rejected an offer of alleged proof \u00f3f loss.

The husband orally directed the policy to be made in the wife\u2019s name. There was no fraudulent misrepresentations as to ownership. There could have,-, been no motive for such representations. Nor could there have been any objection on the part of the company to insure in the wife\u2019s name. Such was the intention of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>parties. The policy was written in the husband\u2019s name by mistake. Equity will reform such a contract: Snyder v. May, 19 Pa. 235; Moliere v. Fire Ins. Co., 5 Rawle, 346 ; Ins. Co. v. Scott, 27 Leg. Int. 76. It is immaterial whose act it was: Moliere v. Ins. Co., above.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b298-4\">The husband had acted as the wife\u2019s agent, and the hus-' band\u2019s purchase of the policy can be supported on the ground of agency: Harris v.

Co., 50 Pa. 349 ; Story, Agency, \u00a7 3, 5th ed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b298-5\">The policy was written with the full knowledge of the company with the intention to insure the wife\u2019s property.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b298-6\">A policy is to be read in the light of the circumstances that surround it: Phila.

To authorize reformation, the mistake must be mutual.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b298-8\">Harris v. York Mut. Ins. Co., 50 Pa. 349, was a mutual company, and the policy contained no provision requiring sole ownership or the nature of the title to be stated, as in our case.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b298-9\">The wife made no contract with defendant, and the husband has no property to insure. The only escape is to strike out of the contract the conditions which stand in the way of recovery.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b298-10\">If the interest is required to be truly stated, a failure to state it renders the policy void: Richards, Insurance, 143.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b298-11\">Conditions in a policy are a part of the contract, and are presumed to be seen and understood by the assured: Kensington National Bank v. Yerkes, 86 Pa. 227.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b298-12\">The \u201c sole and unconditional ownership \u201d clause in a policy of insurance is a reasonable and valid provision: Richards, Insurance, 153; Weed v. London &amp; Lancashire Ins. Co., 116 N. Y. 106; Phila. Tool Co. v. Assurance Co., 132 Pa. 236 ; Grandin v. Ins. Co., 107 Pa. 26. These cases hold that while, in some cases, under the \u201csole ownership clause,\u201d the assured could recover for the interest he had, though it was less than a fee simple, yet in no case could there be a recovery for any interest not covered by the policy.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b299-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>It may be important to tbe risk for tbe company to know whether the insured is sole or only part owner: Grandin v.

Y. 326.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b299-4\">A husband cannot insure his wife\u2019s property in his own name, when the policy requires a disclosure of title: Agricultural Ins.

Chief Justice Paxson,</author>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">This was an action in the court below to recover the amount of loss sustained under a fire insurance policy. Upon the trial below, the plaintiff offered the policy in evidence, which, upon objection, was excluded by the court. The ground for this ruling was that the policy was in the name of Henry Diffenbaugh, while the suit was brought in the name of Emma M. Diffenbaugh, his wife. In other words, the husband insured the property in his own name, while the insurable interest and title thereto was in his wife. The learned judge also declined to permit the plaintiff to prove by her husband that he was acting as her agent when he made the application for the insurance with the agents of defendant company. There was no offer to show that when the company wrote the policy they were informed of the fact that the property belonged to the wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-7\">The plaintiff relies upon Harris v. York Mutual Insurance Company, 50 Pa. 349; Story on Agency, and some other authorities, to sustain her position that where an insurance is effected by an agent, he may insure in his own name, or in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>name and for the benefit of his principal. Story does certainly lay down this doctrine, and we are not now disputing it. All that Harris v. The Insurance Company decided was that a tenant by the curtesy, has an insurable interest in the real estate of his wife. It is true, the language of Woodward, C. J., is broader than the point decided. In the case in hand, however, the policy contains a clause which takes it out of the line of cases cited by the appellant. The clause is as follows: \u201cThis entire policy shall be void .... if the interest of the insured be not truly stated herein.\u201d This clause is not without force. Its meaning is apparent. Its object is to enable the insurance company to know who it is insuring. It might be entirely willing to insure the property of A. and yet refuse to insure the property of B. upon any terms. As there was no pretence that when Henry Diffenbaugh insured this property in his own name, he informed the company that the property belonged to his wife, we are of opinion the latter cannot recover, and that she was properly nonsuited.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">It is true, that equity will reform a written contract in a case of fraud, accident or mistake. There was no evidence, however, before the court, by which this contract could have been reformed, nor was there any offer made to reform it.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
