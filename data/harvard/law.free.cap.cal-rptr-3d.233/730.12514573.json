The District Attorney sought an injunction as well as civil penalties and restitution. Petitioners unsuccessfully moved to strike portions of the operative complaint alleging \"claims for restitution and civil penalties based on conduct outside the territorial jurisdiction of Orange County.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In this writ proceeding, petitioners ask us to resolve a single issue: whether section 17204 of the UCL \"permit[s] a county district attorney to bring a claim that seeks relief for alleged injuries to residents of California counties whom he or she does not represent, based on conduct occurring outside the county he or she serves ....\" Petitioners argue district attorneys have no authority to prosecute civil actions absent specific legislative authorization, and neither the Government Code, nor\n   Business and Professions Code section 17204, authorize the district attorney of a single county to seek statewide penalties for alleged UCL violations. The California Attorney General has filed an amicus brief on the question, as have the California District Attorneys Association; the City Attorneys of Los Angeles, San Diego, San Francisco, and San Jose, Santa Clara County Counsel, and California State Association of Counties (collectively the city attorneys); the United States and California Chambers of Commerce (collectively Chambers of Commerce); and the Consumer Attorneys of California.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   We grant the petition. The California Constitution designates the Attorney General the \"chief law officer of the State\" ( Cal. Const., art. V, \u00a7 13 ), and consistent with this constitutional provision, the Attorney General \"has charge, as attorney, of all legal matters in which the State is interested\" ( Gov. Code, \u00a7 12511 ) and also \"shall ... prosecute or defend all causes to which the State ... is a party in his or her official capacity.\" ( Gov. Code, \u00a7 12512.) The District Attorney, on the other hand, is a county officer whose territorial jurisdiction and power is limited accordingly. Though section 17204 confers standing on\n   district attorneys to sue in the name of the people of the State of California, it cannot constitutionally or reasonably be interpreted to grant the District Attorney power to seek and recover restitution and civil penalty relief for violations occurring outside the jurisdiction of the county in which he was elected. A contrary conclusion would permit the District Attorney to usurp the Attorney General's statewide authority and impermissibly bind his sister district attorneys, precluding them from pursuing their own relief. Thus, in the absence of written consent by the Attorney General and other county district attorneys, the District Attorney must confine such monetary recovery to violations occurring within the county he serves.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Petitioners are companies or wholly-owned subsidiaries involved in the manufacture, distribution or sale of pharmaceuticals or generic prescription drugs, including the prescription drug Niaspan. In October 2016, the Orange County District Attorney, representing \"the People of the State of California\" in association with private counsel, filed a complaint for violations of the UCL, alleging that petitioners either entered into agreements or otherwise engaged in conduct that prevented other generic manufacturers from launching their own Niaspan equivalent, causing purchasers and others in California to overpay for the drug. The District Attorney filed a first amended complaint, the operative pleading, in December 2016. In part, the operative complaint alleges that \"[e]ach sale of Niaspan in violation of Section 17200 constitutes a separate violation,\" and purchasers in California sustained substantial losses in the form of overcharges on each sale based on the petitioners' unlawful and unfair business practices, which violated federal, state, and/or common\n   laws, including federal and state antitrust laws. It alleges that \"the violations of California law complained of herein resulted in damages to consumers of Niaspan in California, including in the County of Orange.\" In addition to an injunction, the complaint seeks an order that petitioners pay restitution of any money acquired through the unlawful and unfair business practices, and civil penalties of up to $2,500 for each violation under sections 17206 and 17206.1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Petitioners thereafter moved to strike from the operative complaint \"all claims for restitution and civil penalties based on conduct outside the territorial jurisdiction of Orange County.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Relying on\n   <em>\n    People v.

He argued that when statewide business practices are at issue, the California Constitution did not prevent the Legislature from giving district attorneys statewide enforcement authority and the ability to obtain statewide relief, which the UCL's plain language indicated the Legislature had done. The District Attorney argued the California Constitution did not restrict his duties and authority under the UCL to obtain statewide relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   During arguments on the motion, the trial court stated its view that the appellate court in\n   <em>\n    Hy-Lond\n   </em>\n   did not address the Napa County district attorney's ability in that case to recover statewide civil penalties; in its opinion,\n   <em>\n    Hy-Lond\n   </em>\n   addressed only whether the district attorney could bind the Attorney General in a settlement relating to misconduct spanning more counties than just Napa County. The court explained that if a settlement occurred in the present case, the Attorney General would be permitted to appear and be heard. The court also questioned\n   <em>\n    Hy-Lond\n   </em>\n   's reliance on\n   <em>\n    Singh v. Superior Court\n   </em>\n   (1919)\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2057650\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app/44/64/\">\n    44 Cal.App. 64\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=185%20P.%20985\">\n    185 P. 985\n   </extracted-citation>\n   in which the Court of Appeal\n   pointed out a district attorney's powers were \"limited territorially to the county for which he has been elected,\" but rejected an argument that a district attorney was not an executive officer or officer of the state for purposes of a bribery statute and dismissed a writ seeking to enjoin proceedings on an indictment.

The Attorney General thereafter sought leave to file an amicus brief and has filed that brief. In view of these developments, we retain power and find good cause to sua sponte retroactively extend the time for providing the notice required under section 17209. (Accord,\n   <em>\n    Black v.

Petitioners challenge the trial court's ruling denying their motion to strike allegations seeking to recover restitution and civil penalties for each sale of Niaspan in the State of California, which rejected the argument that the District Attorney was geographically limited to the County of Orange in seeking such relief. The court's ruling presents a concrete legal dispute over the scope of recovery that a district attorney may seek under the UCL, which is properly the subject of a motion to strike.

We reject the premise of this argument, namely that the petition at hand challenges merely the \"amount\" or sum of the award, as opposed to the District Attorney's power to collect penalties from sales or reimbursements occurring outside the limits of Orange County. We also reject the District Attorney's argument that because the pleading of civil penalties is legally authorized by the UCL, the remedies are not \"irrelevant, false, or improper matter\" subject to a motion to strike. The first amended complaint did not simply plead entitlement to civil penalties, a legally proper remedy in the abstract, but specifically sought such penalties for sales, purchases and reimbursements-alleged to constitute violations of \"federal, state, statutory and/or common laws\"-occurring throughout California. As stated, a motion to strike is proper where petitioners challenge\n   the scope of UCL recovery sought by the District Attorney's pleading.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   E.\n   <em>\n    Important Question of Law\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Finally, the District Attorney argues that this matter does not present, and petitioners have not identified, conflicting lower court decisions or an important issue of law that that should be settled by a ruling on their petition. The District Attorney argues that the proper remedy is \"fact specific,\" and \"[s]uch matters cannot be determined in one broad sweeping statement of the law ....\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The arguments are without merit.

But the issue in that case was estoppel and the court declined to apply the doctrine; to the extent\n   <em>\n    Mendez\n   </em>\n   says anything about a district attorney's power to bind the state, it stands for the unremarkable proposition that in criminal cases, the state is the party regardless of whether it is represented by the district attorney or the Attorney General.

Contrary to the assertions of the District Attorney and amici city attorneys, the text of the UCL provides no basis to conclude the Legislature intended to grant local prosecutors extraterritorial jurisdiction to recover statewide monetary relief. The District Attorney points to the UCL's silence on the issue; he asserts the UCL's text contains no geographical limitation on the remedies district attorneys may recover, nor\n   is such a limitation expressed in its purpose or legislative history.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   He argues the UCL equates district attorneys' authority with that of the Attorney General, and we must abide by the statute's plain language and not read limitations into it.

We agree section 17204 does not explicitly extend the limits of district attorneys' territorial jurisdiction, or vest district attorneys with authority to recover restitution or civil penalties for violations beyond the geographic scope of their counties. The statute must do so specifically, to support the District Attorney's position. (\n   <em>\n    Safer v.

As the Attorney General points out, section 17206, subdivision (c), which distributes penalties depending on which agency obtains them, requires the Attorney General's Office to deposit half of its collected civil penalties into the state's general fund, with the other half going to the county in which the judgment is entered, while district attorneys must deposit collected penalties only to the treasurer of their respective counties. According to the Attorney General, in drafting this provision, the Legislature contemplated that only the Attorney General may seek redress for statewide violations, and local prosecutors, absent a joint prosecution agreement, may address only misconduct occurring within their city or county. We agree that by structuring the statute so that penalties collected by a district attorney go only to the treasurer of the\n   county in which the judgment was entered, the Legislature has manifested its understanding that a district attorney's redress is restricted to local violations, benefitting the electorate to which the district attorney is accountable. There is no indication the Legislature sought to write the UCL so broadly as to permit county district attorneys to collect penalties from violations occurring outside their county boundaries for their own county treasurers. To the contrary, it is reasonable to conclude the Legislature intended to prevent local prosecutors from \"step[ping] outside [their] jurisdictional boundaries\" (\n   <em>\n    State ex rel.

The constitutional limitations need not be explicitly set forth, as evidenced by Government Code section 26500, which authorizes a district attorney to \"initiate and conduct on behalf of the people\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   prosecutions for public offenses\" (italics added) but nevertheless does not permit a district attorney to prosecute crimes outside his or her county.

The District Attorney argues that to prevent a district attorney from seeking statewide relief \"would arbitrarily shield Defendants from liability for the full extent of their illegal misconduct and/or require district attorney suits in all California counties in order to secure any form of statewide relief ....\" He asserts that private parties may secure statewide relief, and there is \"no logical reason\" why public prosecutors may not, since prosecutors do not stand in the victims' shoes and relief is awarded to consumers, not to the prosecutor. But a private plaintiff suing under the UCL is not entitled to seek civil penalties, and after Proposition 64, such a plaintiff must not only show he or she has \" 'suffered injury in fact and has lost money or property\n   as a result of' \" the wrongful acts, but also meet class action requirements in order to bring a representative action. (\n   <em>\n    Arias v.

We see nothing incongruous in the distinction. Contrary to the suggestion of the Consumer Attorneys nothing in our decision changes the fact that a district attorney's UCL action is brought on the state's behalf to enforce its police or regulatory power. And the District Attorney is free to enter into agreements with the Attorney General or sister district attorneys to obtain a delegation of authority, or engage in joint prosecutions, where the District Attorney believes there is public benefit to a multi-jurisdictional action.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Cf.\n   <em>\n    California Air Resources Board v.

DATO, dissenting.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   As an intermediate appellate court, our primary role is to review\n   final decisions of the superior court for prejudicial error. We generally avoid broad legal policy pronouncements, leaving that to the Supreme Court and the Legislature. Sometimes policy considerations can play an important part in our decisions, but even then we take pains to assure that the policy questions are squarely presented by the facts of the case and necessary to the decision we are required to render.\n   I believe the majority's decision to entertain the writ petition in this case violates each of these salutary guidelines. The majority then compound this error by deciding the ill-framed legal issue in a manner that will materially impair the interests of California consumers by fundamentally altering the structure of consumer protection laws in this state. For these reasons, I respectfully dissent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Let's start with what is really going on here. As is expressly authorized by statute ( Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 17204\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   ), the Orange County District Attorney has charged defendant pharmaceutical manufacturers with engaging in a statewide unfair business practice in violation of the Unfair Competition Law. (UCL;\u00a7 17200 et seq.) This statewide practice has allegedly harmed consumers in Orange County and throughout California in a similar fashion. The parties agree that should the court ultimately find the allegations of the complaint have been proved, it has the authority to issue statewide injunctive relief. But for a defendant in a state the size of California, a law enforcement action alleging a statewide unlawful business practice and seeking monetary relief creates, at least potentially, a substantial economic exposure. To the extent law enforcement can be Balkanized and monetary relief limited to local jurisdictions-especially early in the litigation-a defendant's \"management\" of the exposure is greatly facilitated. It is hardly surprising, then, that defendants in this case sought to craft a motion to \"strike claims for restitution and civil penalties to the extent that those are not limited to Orange County.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   But there is an immediate problem with use of the motion-to-strike mechanism, for nowhere in the motion do defendants identify any language they seek to excise from the complaint that specifically seeks restitution or civil penalties for acts and practices that occurred entirely outside Orange County. Tellingly, the motion to strike nowhere references the complaint's prayer for relief, which simply requests \"restitution of any money acquired by Defendants' unlawful and unfair business practices,\" as well as \"civil penalties for each act of unfair and unlawful competition.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Instead, defendants' motion sought to strike all references in the complaint to \"California\" users of defendants' products and/or events that occurred \"in California.\" But these descriptive statements are plainly relevant to the request for statewide\n   injunctive relief.

These words of caution are particularly applicable to a motion to strike that does not challenge the plaintiff's ability to plead a valid claim, but merely seeks to edit the language of the\n   complaint in a manner that better suits the defendants' tactical purposes. Neither defendants nor the majority offer anything approaching an \"extraordinary reason\" to justify this court's decision to intervene at the pleading stage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   The propriety of extraordinary writ review aside, the decision to prematurely intervene in this case has unnecessarily placed this court in the middle of a jurisdictional turf spat between public prosecutors. In doing so the majority attempt to construct a solution in search of a problem. The alleged \"problem\" here is an overzealous district attorney who seeks to recover (1) restitution on behalf of residents of other counties, and (2) civil penalties based on business practices that have no connection to the district attorney's local jurisdiction. Apparently, this bothers the Attorney General, who wishes to limit and control all litigation involving statewide unlawful business practices, and perhaps other district attorneys in other counties, who may view the actions of the Orange County District Attorney as \"poaching\" on their ability to recover civil penalties that would otherwise flow into their own county's treasury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Business and Professions Code section 17204 broadly permits UCL enforcement actions to be \"prosecuted ... by the Attorney General or a district attorney ....\" Either way, the action is pursued \"in the name of the people of the State of California,\" just as in criminal cases. ( \u00a7 17204.) Section 17203 permits the court, ancillary to its injunctive power, \"to restore to\n   <em>\n    any person in interest\n   </em>\n   any money or property, real or personal, which may have been acquired by means of\" the unlawful or unfair practice. ( \u00a7 17203, italics added.) Section 17206 similarly authorizes the court to award a civil penalty for each UCL violation, \"recover[able] in a civil action brought ... by the Attorney General [or] by any district attorney ....\" ( \u00a7 17206, subd. (a).) Nothing in any of these\n   statutes limits a county district attorney to prosecuting UCL actions on behalf of citizens of in that particular county. Nor does anything in the UCL restrict a district attorney to recovering restitution on behalf of only county residents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   As justification for reaching out at the pleading stage to prematurely decide a major public policy issue not squarely presented or addressed by the trial court, the majority allude to vague notions of interference with the Attorney General's constitutional authority. They suggest that if a local district attorney can seek restitution on behalf of residents of other counties, or civil penalties attributable to violations in other counties, this would allow the district attorney \"to impermissibly compromise and bind the Attorney General and the district attorneys of other counties,\" preventing them \"from seeking further relief for violations occurring in their own communities.\" (Maj. opn.,\n   <em>\n    ante\n   </em>\n   , at p. 747.) They then purport to interpret the relevant sections of the UCL to avoid a constitutional issue. (Maj. opn.,\n   <em>\n    ante\n   </em>\n   , at p. 747-48.) Respectfully, the majority rely on a phantom constitutional concern to craft a cure that is worse than even the perceived disease.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   The UCL is an exceedingly broad remedial statute designed to encourage multiple avenues of enforcement. (See\n   <em>\n    Kasky v. Nike, Inc.\n   </em>\n   (2002)\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1103388\" index=\"297\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-4th/27/939/#p949\">\n    27 Cal.4th 939\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 949-950,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"298\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=119%20Cal.%20Rptr.%202d%20296\">\n    119 Cal.Rptr.2d 296\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"299\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=45%20P.3d%20243\">\n    45 P.3d 243\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) Indeed, a district attorney can prosecute a UCL claim based even on alleged violations of a statute that provides a different government agency with the sole authority to bring enforcement actions. (\n   <em>\n    People v. McKale\n   </em>\n   (1979)\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2270585\" index=\"300\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-3d/25/626/#p633\">\n    25 Cal.3d 626\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 632-633,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"301\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=159%20Cal.%20Rptr.%20811\">\n    159 Cal.Rptr. 811\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"302\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=602%20P.2d%20731\">\n    602 P.2d 731\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) And as the majority recognize, \"the civil remedies of the [UCL] were enacted because criminal\n   remedies were too often inadequate to protect the public, especially where corporate defendants were concerned.\" (\n   <em>\n    People v. E.W.A.P. Inc.\n   </em>\n   (1980)\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1973305\" index=\"303\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app-3d/106/315/#p321\">\n    106 Cal.App.3d 315\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 321,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"304\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=165%20Cal.%20Rptr.%2073\">\n    165 Cal.Rptr. 73\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) Pursuing litigation against corporate defendants is expensive, and the Legislature was doubtless aware that both financial and political considerations may sometimes discourage a public prosecutor from undertaking such a case. Consistent with the UCL's broad remedial purposes and the perceived need for vigorous enforcement, there is nothing unconstitutional about the Legislature's decision to permit and encourage multiple public prosecutors with overlapping lines of authority on the theory that more enforcement in this context is better than less.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   Moreover, the concern about a local district attorney binding other prosecutors to an improper or inadequate settlement is as fanciful as it is premature. Where, as here, a district attorney brings a UCL enforcement action alleging a statewide unlawful business practice, the Attorney General as the state's chief law enforcement officer always has the authority to intervene and take over the case. As a prominent treatise explains:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-94\">\n   [T]he Attorney General and the 58 district attorney offices have entered into an arrangement to coordinate\n   the filing of \u00a7 17200 actions. Every \u00a7\u00a7 17200/17500 investigation must be logged onto the computer database under the name of the prospective defendant. That puts other DA offices and the AG on notice of the investigation, and gives the AG the opportunity to intervene, assume jurisdiction, and take control of the investigation and proceeding where the matter is deemed sufficiently important to warrant it, or where there appears to be a conflict among offices. (Stern, Cal. Practice Guide: Business &amp; Professions Code Section 17200 Practice (The Rutter Group 2018) \u00b6 9:6.)\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Accordingly, there is no practical risk that a local district attorney will \"compromise and bind\" the Attorney General or district attorneys from other counties. Even if the Attorney General does not elect to formally intervene at the outset and take over a case, it can monitor and take appropriate action if and when the prosecuting district attorney proposes to settle.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Similarly district attorneys in other affected counties could consult with the Attorney General or ask the court to be heard as to any eventual settlement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   The majority's heavy reliance on\n   <em>\n    People v. Hy-Lond Enterprises, Inc.\n   </em>\n   (1979)\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2025618\" index=\"305\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app-3d/93/734/#p751\">\n    93 Cal.App.3d 734\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"306\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=155%20Cal.%20Rptr.%20880\">\n    155 Cal.Rptr. 880\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Hy-Lond\n   </em>\n   ) is significantly misplaced. In that case, the Napa County District Attorney brought a UCL action against the operator of numerous skilled nursing facilities located throughout the state, only one of which was in Napa. Restitution was not at issue, and no one challenged the District Attorney's ability to seek civil penalties for violations occurring outside of Napa County.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   The issue in the case involved the scope of a\n   <em>\n    stipulated settlement\n   </em>\n   between the District Attorney and the defendant. In exchange for general injunctive relief (i.e., comply with applicable laws in the future) and payment of civil penalties, the settlement made the Napa County District Attorney the \"exclusive government agency\" for enforcing the injunction.

The problem was in limiting enforcement as to\n   <em>\n    future\n   </em>\n   violations. (See\n   <em>\n    Avco Community Developers, Inc. v. South Coast Regional Com\n   </em>\n   (1976)\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2292816\" index=\"312\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-3d/17/785/#p800\">\n    17 Cal.3d 785\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 800,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"313\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=132%20Cal.%20Rptr.%20386\">\n    132 Cal.Rptr. 386\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"314\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=553%20P.2d%20546\">\n    553 P.2d 546\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [\"it is settled that the government may not contract away its right to exercise the police power in the future\"].) In other words, said the\n   <em>\n    Hy-Lond\n   </em>\n   court, \"the district attorney has purported to stipulate to restraints which the court could not properly impose.\" (\n   <em>\n    Hy-Lond, supra,\n   </em>\n   93 Cal.App.3d at p. 753,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"315\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=155%20Cal.%20Rptr.%20880\">\n    155 Cal.Rptr. 880\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) Here, the Orange County District Attorney hasn't offered to stipulate to anything, and the court hasn't proposed to approve any stipulation. No one has suggested limiting the power of the Attorney General or any district attorney to do anything, in the future or otherwise. Any musings by the\n   <em>\n    Hy-Lond\n   </em>\n   court about territorial limitations on the authority of the county district attorney are just that-musings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   C\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   The resounding theme so far is that we should not be deciding anything about a local district attorney's authority to request restitution and civil penalties attributable to victims and conduct outside the county. The issues the defendants seek to frame by means of their motion to strike are not squarely-or even unsquarely-presented. And certainly, there are no exceptional circumstances that warrant a departure from the general rule that we do not review undeveloped legal issues at the pleading stage of a lawsuit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   But even if the issues were properly presented in a procedural context that demanded their resolution, the majority opinion reaches the wrong result. If the Orange County District Attorney succeeds in proving his case, there is nothing inherently problematic about\n   <em>\n    the court\n   </em>\n   awarding restitution to statewide victims of defendants' unlawful business practice. As already noted, even absent a request by the District Attorney the court is empowered by section 17203 to award restitution to \"to\n   <em>\n    any person\n   </em>\n   \" adversely affected by the defendants' unlawful conduct. This includes, potentially, residents of counties other than Orange. And it is well established that the District Attorney's action will have no res judicata effect on a private party's restitution claim, except to the extent that the party signs a release. (\n   <em>\n    Payne v. National Collection Systems, Inc.\n   </em>\n   (2001)\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"226408\" index=\"316\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app-4th/91/1037/#p1047\">\n    91 Cal.App.4th 1037\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1047,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"317\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=111%20Cal.%20Rptr.%202d%20260\">\n    111 Cal.Rptr.2d 260\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [\"traditional res judicata principles have no application to a judgment resulting from an unlawful competition law lawsuit filed by the Attorney General or another public prosecutor in a subsequent lawsuit\n   brought by a victim of improper\n   business practices\"]; see\n   <em>\n    Kamm v.

The penalties are the punishment imposed for each violation proved in a law enforcement action brought on behalf of the People of the State of California. If the violation is proved, the penalties are appropriately imposed. Assume a criminal defendant is charged with multiple offenses as part of a single crime spree that spanned several counties. Convicted of all offenses following a trial in one of the counties, surely the defendant would not be heard to argue that the district attorney could not request punishment and the court could not sentence him on any of the crimes he committed in a different county. (See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    People v. Sering\n   </em>\n   (1991)\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6036414\" index=\"319\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app-3d/232/677/#p684\">\n    232 Cal.App.3d 677\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 684-685,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"320\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=283%20Cal.%20Rptr.%20507\">\n    283 Cal.Rptr. 507\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .)

Superior Court\n   </em>\n   (1989)\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6039851\" index=\"329\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app-3d/209/1266/#p1273\">\n    209 Cal.App.3d 1266\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1273,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"330\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=258%20Cal.%20Rptr.%2066\">\n    258 Cal.Rptr. 66\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) Rarely do those principles so uniformly counsel against issuance of writ relief as they do here. In choosing to ignore these sound prudential considerations, the majority\n   reach out to unnecessarily resolve-incorrectly in my view-an internecine dispute among public prosecutors, to the ultimate detriment of the \"public\" we are all charged with serving.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   I would deny the petition.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-108\">\n    Statutory references are to the Business and Professions Code unless otherwise specified.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-124\">\n    Statutory references are to the Business and Professions Code unless otherwise specified.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-125\">\n    The majority assert that the District Attorney's complaint \"specifically sought [civil] penalties for sales occurring throughout California\" (maj. opn.,\n    <em>\n     ante\n    </em>\n    , at p. 737), but nowhere specify where in the complaint they find this \"specific\" request.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-126\">\n    Significantly, although it takes no formal position on defendants' motion to strike, the Attorney General's amicus brief agrees that allegations in the complaint regarding defendants' statewide misconduct may be entirely proper.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-127\">\n    The fact that this comment was made in the context of argument on the demurrer rather than the motion to strike (maj. opn.,\n    <em>\n     ante\n    </em>\n    , at p. 737, fn. 4) hardly changes the substance of the statement. The court was clearly stating that questions regarding the scope of monetary relief would be addressed at a later date, not now.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-128\">\n    The majority opinion inexplicably concludes that this statement \"in no way suggest[s] the court declined to reach the issue presented by petitioners' motion to strike.\" (Maj. opn.,\n    <em>\n     ante\n    </em>\n    , at p. 737, fn. 4.) I see no way to read the statement\n    <em>\n     other than\n    </em>\n    as indicating the court was not ruling on the proper scope of monetary relief. And even assuming the statement was in some way ambiguous, why would we reach out at the pleading stage to issue an extraordinary writ correcting an implication that might or might not have been intended by the trial judge?\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-129\">\n    The trial judge in this case was particularly sensitive to this issue. She told defense counsel, \"If you reach a settlement with the District Attorney ... and if the [Attorney General] comes in and says I want to be heard about this, you bet I'm going to let them be heard on this. ...\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-130\">\n    It makes no difference that the penalties are allocated by statute to the county treasurer when the enforcement action is prosecuted by the local district attorney. (\u00a7 17206, subd. (c).) It is certainly reasonable for the Legislature to conclude that revenue from the penalties should benefit the county whose resources were used to prosecute the action and recover the penalties. This is particularly true where the statute specifies that the funds thus recovered are to be used exclusively for the enforcement of consumer protection laws.
