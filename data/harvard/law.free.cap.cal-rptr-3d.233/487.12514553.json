(\n   <em>\n    Liberty Surplus Ins. Corp. v. Ledesma &amp; Meyer Constr. Co.\n   </em>\n   (9th Cir. 2016)\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6055400\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/834/998/#p1000\">\n    834 F.3d 998\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1000.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The answer turns on whether the injury can be considered \"accidental.\" We conclude that it can.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   I. BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Appellants Ledesma &amp; Meyer Construction Company, Inc. and its principals, Joseph Ledesma and Kris Meyer (collectively, L&amp;M) contracted with the San Bernardino Unified School District to manage a construction project at a middle school. In 2003, L&amp;M hired Darold Hecht as an assistant superintendent and assigned him to the project. In 2010, Jane Doe, a 13-year-old student at the school, sued in state court alleging that Hecht had sexually abused her. Doe's claims include a cause of action against L&amp;M for negligently hiring, retaining, and supervising Hecht.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   L&amp;M tendered the defense to its insurers, Liberty Surplus Insurance Corporation and Liberty Insurance Underwriters, Inc. (collectively, Liberty). Liberty defended L&amp;M under a reservation of rights. It also sought declaratory relief in federal court, contending it had no obligation to defend or indemnify L&amp;M. The commercial\n   general liability policy at issue provided coverage for \" 'bodily injury' \" \"caused by an 'occurrence.' \" \"Occurrence\" was defined as \"an accident.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The\n   district court granted summary judgment to Liberty on its claim for declaratory relief.\n   The court reasoned that Doe's injury was not caused by an \"occurrence\" because the \"alleged negligent hiring, retention and supervision were acts antecedent to the sexual molestation .... While they set in motion and created the potential for injury, they were too attenuated from the injury-causing conduct committed by Hecht.\" The court was not persuaded by the argument that L&amp;M's supervision and retention of Hecht continued until the time of the molestation. \"First, the supervision and retention are still not the injury-causing acts. Second, courts have rejected the argument that the insured's intentional acts of hiring, supervising, and retaining are accidents, simply because the insured did not intend for the injury to occur.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On appeal, L&amp;M argued that the district court misapplied California law. The Court of Appeals sought our opinion. As we explain, L&amp;M's position is correct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   II. DISCUSSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   As a general matter, the meaning of the term \"accident\" in a liability insurance policy is settled in California. \"[A]n accident is ' \"an unexpected, unforeseen, or undesigned happening or consequence from either a known or an unknown cause.\" ' [Citations.] 'This common law construction of the term \"accident\" becomes part of the policy and precludes any assertion that the term is ambiguous.' \" (\n   <em>\n    Delgado v.

The district court appeared to recognize that in analyzing\n   the potential for coverage, the focus is properly on the alleged negligence of L&amp;M as the insured employer. It is undisputed that Hecht's sexual misconduct was a \"wilful act\" beyond the scope of insurance coverage under Insurance Code section 533. (\n   <em>\n    J. C. Penney Casualty Ins. Co. v. M. K.\n   </em>\n   (1991)\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2375128\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-3d/52/1009/#p1025\">\n    52 Cal.3d 1009\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1025,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=278%20Cal.%20Rptr.%2064\">\n    278 Cal.Rptr. 64\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=804%20P.2d%20689\">\n    804 P.2d 689\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) However, Hecht's intentional conduct does not preclude potential coverage for L&amp;M. We noted the distinction between an intentional act of molestation and merely negligent supervision in\n   <em>\n    Minkler v. Safeco Ins. Co. of America\n   </em>\n   (2010)\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6050834\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-4th/49/315/\">\n    49 Cal.4th 315\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=110%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20612\">\n    110 Cal.Rptr.3d 612\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=232%20P.3d%20612\">\n    232 P.3d 612\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Minkler\n   </em>\n   ). There the plaintiff sued his Little League coach for sexual molestation. He also sued the coach's mother, whom he accused of negligent supervision for failing to prevent molestations that occurred in her home. The coach was listed as an additional insured on his mother's homeowners insurance policy. We held that an exclusion for injuries arising from an insured's intentional acts did not apply to the mother's liability for negligence. \"[T]his is not a situation where the only tort was the intentional act of one insured, and where the liability of a second insured, who claims coverage, is merely\n   <em>\n    vicarious\n   </em>\n   or\n   <em>\n    derivative\n   </em>\n   . On the contrary, [the plaintiff's] claim against [the mother] clearly depends upon allegations that she herself committed an\n   <em>\n    independent tort\n   </em>\n   in failing to prevent acts of molestation she had reason to believe were taking place in her home. Under such circumstances, she had objective grounds to assume she\n   would be covered, so long as she herself had not acted in a manner for which the intentional acts exclusion barred coverage.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at p. 325,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=110%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20612\">\n    110 Cal.Rptr.3d 612\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=232%20P.3d%20612\">\n    232 P.3d 612\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Minkler\n   </em>\n   we did not consider whether the claims involved were \"accidents\" under the applicable insurance policies, because the issue was not raised. (\n   <em>\n    Minkler\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , 49 Cal.4th at p. 322, fn. 3,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=110%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20612\">\n    110 Cal.Rptr.3d 612\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=232%20P.3d%20612\">\n    232 P.3d 612\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) But our reasoning there establishes that L&amp;M may be covered even though Hecht's intentional acts were beyond the scope of its policy. L&amp;M's allegedly negligent hiring, retention, and supervision were independently tortious acts, which form the basis of its claim against Liberty for defense and indemnity. The district court's ruling was consistent with\n   <em>\n    Minkler\n   </em>\n   . It did not rely on the fact that Hecht's conduct was intentional, but on two other grounds: a causation analysis, and the court's reading of case law. Both lines of reasoning were faulty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   As to liability insurance coverage, tort principles govern the question of causation. \"In analyzing coverage under a liability policy, a 'tort approach' [citation] to causation of damages is precisely what is called for .... When the insurer has promised to indemnify the insured for all 'sums which the Insured shall become obligated to pay ... for damages ... because of' nonexcluded property damage, or similar language, coverage necessarily turns on whether the damages for which the insured became liable resulted-\n   <em>\n    under tort law\n   </em>\n   -from covered causes.\" (\n   <em>\n    State of California v.

Jury Instns. (2018) CACI Nos. 400, 430.) The district court ruled that L&amp;M's alleged negligence was, as a matter of law, \"too attenuated\" from Hecht's acts of molestation. It reasoned that L&amp;M's actions set the chain of events in motion but did not legally cause Doe's injuries. That reasoning runs counter to California cases expressly recognizing that negligent hiring, retention, or supervision may be a substantial factor in a sexual molestation perpetrated by an employee, depending on the facts presented.

There we addressed Delgado's further contention that the attack was accidental because the insured unreasonably believed he was required to act in self-defense. We disagreed, holding that such a belief could not convert the assault, an act that was purposeful and intended to inflict injury, into an accidental occurrence. We emphasized that the acts of the insured \"must be considered the starting point of the causal series of events, not the injured party's acts .... The term 'accident' in the policy's coverage clause refers to the injury-producing acts of the insured, not those of\n   the injured party. [Citations.] In determining whether the injury is a result of an accident, taking into consideration acts or events before the insured's acts would be illogical and contrary to California case law. [\u00b6] 'Any given event, including an injury, is always the result of many causes.' (1 Dobbs, The Law of Torts (2001) \u00a7 171, p. 414.) For that reason, the law looks for purposes of causation analysis 'to those causes which are so closely connected with the result and of such significance that the law is justified in imposing liability.' (Prosser &amp; Keeton on Torts (5th ed. 1984) \u00a7 41, p. 264.) In a case of assault and battery, it is the use of force on another that is closely connected to the resulting injury. To look to acts within the causal chain that are antecedent to and more remote from the assaultive conduct would render legal responsibilities too uncertain.\" (\n   <em>\n    Delgado\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , 47 Cal.4th at pp. 315-316,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=97%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20298\">\n    97 Cal.Rptr.3d 298\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=211%20P.3d%201083\">\n    211 P.3d 1083\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Delgado\n   </em>\n   , the insured's intentional tortious conduct was the immediate cause of injury.

Nevertheless,\n   <em>\n    Delgado\n   </em>\n   's analysis is applicable to our scenario, and supports L&amp;M's position.

As discussed above, a finder of fact could conclude that the causal connection between L&amp;M's alleged negligence and the injury inflicted by Hecht was close enough to justify the imposition of liability on L&amp;M. Under\n   <em>\n    Delgado\n   </em>\n   , L&amp;M's acts must be considered the starting point of the series of events leading to Doe's molestation.

(L&amp;M), Darold Hecht, committed sexual acts against a 13-year-old student, Jane Doe, at a school where Hecht was working on a construction project undertaken by L&amp;M. Doe sued L&amp;M, among others, and L&amp;M tendered its defense to its insurer Liberty Surplus Insurance Corporation, with whom L&amp;M had a commercial general liability policy. The question is whether that suit alleges an \"occurrence\" under L&amp;M's commercial general liability policy. I agree with today's opinion that the answer is yes, but I write separately to clarify three aspects of the understanding of an \"accident.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The insurance policy in this case provides that \"[t]his insurance applies to 'bodily injury' and 'property damages' only if: [\u00b6] (1) The 'bodily injury' ... is caused by an 'occurrence' that takes place in the 'coverage territory' ....\" In the \"Definitions\" section of the policy, the term \" 'Occurrence' \" is defined as \"an accident, including continuous or repeated exposure to substantially the same general harmful conditions.\" Thus, the question of coverage turns on whether the injury to Doe was the result of an \"accident\" caused by L&amp;M and more generally whether, when an employee intentionally causes injury to a third party, that injury can be considered accidental if it was caused by the employer's negligent hiring, retention, or supervision of the employee. Today's opinion holds that such injury can be caused by accident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   In support of this result, the court starts with the commonsense definition in\n   <em>\n    Delgado v. Interinsurance Exchange of Automobile Club of Southern California\n   </em>\n   (2009)\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3899435\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-4th/47/302/#p308\">\n    47 Cal.4th 302\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 308,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=97%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20298\">\n    97 Cal.Rptr.3d 298\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=211%20P.3d%201083\">\n    211 P.3d 1083\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Delgado\n   </em>\n   ): \"[A]n accident is ' \"an unexpected, unforeseen, or undesigned happening or consequence from either a known or an unknown cause.\" ' \" (See maj. opn.,\n   <em>\n    ante\n   </em>\n   , 233 Cal.Rptr.3d at p. 490, 418 P.3d at p. 403.) However, the court further states, \" 'Under California law, the word \"accident\" in the coverage clause of a liability policy refers to the\n   <em>\n    conduct of the insured\n   </em>\n   for which liability is sought to be imposed ....' \" (\n   <em>\n    Ibid.\n   </em>\n   , quoting\n   <em>\n    Delgado\n   </em>\n   , at p. 311,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=97%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20298\">\n    97 Cal.Rptr.3d 298\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=211%20P.3d%201083\">\n    211 P.3d 1083\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) This formulation conflates the term \"accident\" with the conduct that eventually and proximately causes injury. In this case, L&amp;M's hiring, supervising, and retaining Hecht were not \"accidents\"; those were deliberate, intentional acts. It was Hecht's sexual abuse of the victim and resulting injury that comprised the accident, from L&amp;M's perspective. In other words, because Hecht's actions and the injury to the victim were \" ' \"unexpected, unforeseen, or undesigned happening[s] or consequence[s]\" ' \" from L&amp;M's perspective, they were accidents in the context of providing insurance for L&amp;M.

Thus, in a liability insurance policy, an \"accident\" does not necessarily refer to the conduct of the insured; rather, it is an \" ' \"unexpected, unforeseen, or undesigned happening or consequence\" ' \"\n   <em>\n    resulting from\n   </em>\n   the conduct of the insured.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   This understanding of \"accident\" is consistent with the court's answer to the question presented. Under the commercial general liability policy at issue, there is coverage for bodily injury so long as \"[t]he\n   'bodily injury' ... is caused by an 'occurrence' that takes place in the 'coverage territory.' \" Thus, if an insured's conduct in negligent hiring, retention, or supervision of its employee results in an accident that causes bodily injury, that injury is covered by the insurance policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The court addresses a number of cases cited by the federal district court, which arrived at a contrary answer to the question presented.

In that case, as part of a settlement, the insured assigned his claim against his homeowner's insurer to the injured party, Jonathan Delgado. Delgado argued that the attack was accidental because the insured unreasonably believed he was required to act in self-defense. We rejected this argument, holding that such belief could not convert the assault, an act that was purposeful and intended to inflict injury, into an accidental occurrence. In so doing,\n   <em>\n    Delgado\n   </em>\n   stated that the acts of the insured \"must be considered the starting point of the causal series of events, not the injured party's acts ....

[\u00b6] 'Any given event, including an injury, is always the result of many causes.' (1 Dobbs, The Law of Torts (2001) \u00a7 171, p. 414.) For that reason, the law looks for purposes of causation analysis 'to those causes which are so closely connected with the result and of such significance that the law is justified in imposing liability.' (Prosser &amp; Keeton on Torts (5th ed. 1984) \u00a7 41, p. 264.) In a case of assault and battery, it is the use of force on another that is closely connected to the resulting injury.

There are myriad situations where we would examine prior events to determine whether an insured's acts resulted in an accidental injury. For example, suppose an insured driver steps on the\n   accelerator because a passenger spilled coffee on the driver and as a result the car hits another car and causes injury to its occupants. In determining whether the injury was accidental, we would of course look to the act of the coffee-spilling passenger, even though the passenger was not the insured. Indeed, any time a motorist takes evasive action due to some situation on the road and thereby causes injury, we would consider that situation-a prior event-in determining whether there was an \"accident.\" (See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    Davilla v.

Consider another example: In a crowded bar, a patron trips and falls with his arms outstretched resembling a punching motion.

To use\n   <em>\n    Merced\n   </em>\n   's language, there would be an \"aspect in the causal series of events leading to the injury or damage\"-namely, the fact that the victim was not consenting-that was \"unintended by the insured\" and a \"matter of fortuity\" from the perspective of the insured.

The court stated that \"[a]ll of the acts, the manner in which they were done, and the objective accomplished occurred exactly as [the insured] intended.\" (\n   <em>\n    Merced\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , 213 Cal.App.3d at p. 50,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"127\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=261%20Cal.%20Rptr.%20273\">\n    261 Cal.Rptr. 273\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) If the insured believed the victim to be nonconsenting, then the insured's acts were intentional, not accidental, and no insurance coverage would ensue. But insofar as\n   <em>\n    Merced\n   </em>\n   is understood to hold that a mistake in apprehending another's consent (or lack thereof) can categorically never give rise to an accident, that is inconsistent with our law on the meaning of \"accident.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   In all other respects, I join the opinion of the court.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"*\">\n   <p id=\"p-64\">\n    Presiding Justice of the Court of Appeal, Second Appellate District, Division Eight, assigned by the Chief Justice pursuant to article VI, section 6 of the California Constitution.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-65\">\n    We have rephrased the question slightly.
