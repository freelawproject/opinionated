Williams', trustee under a deed of trust for the bene1fit of creditors from Charles L. Solley. The exception was filed by the appellees, Josiah 0. Armiger and James Si Armiger, co-partners, trading as J. 0. Armiger and Brother, who purchased the property from the1 appellant at a public sale, and isi based upon an alleged defect in the title- of Charles L. Solley, who claims under two deeds, one dated September 3rd, 1896-, and the other dated the 4th of October, 1909.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-9\">By the first of these deeds Sarah, Ann Solley, \u201cin consideration of natural lov\u00e9 and affection and the sum of five dollars,\u201d granted and conveyed the property therein described and containing about one hundred and fourteen acres- of land to George II. Solley, \u201chis heirs and assigns, * * \" in trust for the sole and separate use and benefit of Mary W. Johnson, wife of William O. Johnson, for and during the period \u25a0of her natural life and no longer, so that she, during the period of her natural life, may be permitted and suffered to have, hold, use, occupy and possess the aforesaid parcel of ground with all the rights, appurtenances and rents, issues and profits- thereof to receive, take and apply to her separate use and benefit, her receipts; alone being good and sufficient acquittances and discharges for all such rents, issues and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>profits; so that the said, parcel of ground shall not at any time or in any manner be liable for any debts of her present or any future husband, and from and after the death, of the said Mary W. Johnson, then in trust for all and every the children the said Mary W. Johnson now has or the child or children she may hereafter have, and their executors; administrators and assigns, as, tenants in common equally, the issue of any deceased child of said Mary W. Johnson, if any such issuci there should be, to take the part, or proportion only to which the parent of such issue if living would be entitled.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A9e\">By the second deed Mary W. Johnson and William C. Johnson, her,husband, Stella S. Thornton and Arthur Thornton, her husband, James, A. Johnson and Emma Johnson, his wife; George W. Johnson and Annie M. Johnson, his wife, Harry M. Johnson and Amanda R. Johnson, his wife, conveyed \u201call their right, title, interest and estate in and to\u201d said parcel of land to Charles L. \u00a1Solley, who, on the Kith of October, 1934, conveyed it to the appellant, in trust for the benefit of his creditors.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">it appears from the agreed statement of facts that Mary W. J ohnson, who at the date of the sale made by the appellant was, a widow aud sixty-eight years, of age, \u201chad only five children,\u201d viz: Stella S. Thornton, James A. Johnson, Harry M. Johnson, George W. Johnson \u201cand a deceased child who died in infancy, unmarried and without issue\u201d; that Stella S. Thornton died \u201cleaving no children\u201d; \u201cthat there are no other children of \"Mary AM Johnson, * * * nor descendants' of any deceased child of Mary AA7. Johnson,\u201d and that George II. S'ollev died in April, 39.14, leaving heirs, all of whom are \u201cnow of full age and reside in the State of Maryland.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AYz\">The appellant contends that the deed from Sarah Ann Solley, under the Rule in Shelley\u2019s Case and the Statute of Uses, conveyed to Alary W. Johnson the legal estate in fee simple, and that the deed from Alary W. Johnson and other\u00bb operated to vest the same title in Charles L. Solley, while the contention of the appellees is that the deed from Sarah Ann Solley conveyed to the trustee the legal title, and to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>Mary M. Johnson only an equitable life estate, with contingent remainders to her children.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">The rule relied on by the appellant (which has been abrogated by the Act of 1912, Ch. <em>l\u00e1\u00e9, </em>as to instruments executed after the 31st of May of that year) is, \u201cthat when the ancestor, by any gift or conveyance, taketh an estate of freehold, and in the same gift or conveyance an estate is limited either mediately or immediately, to his heirs, in fee or in tail, <em>the hews </em>are words of limitation of the estate, and not words of purchase.\u201d Or as stated in <em>Preston on Estates </em>and adopted by Chaeoellob Keet, \u201cWhen a person takes an estate, of freehold, legally or equitably, under a deed, will or other writing, and in the same instrument there is a limitation by way of remainder, edtheiywith or without the interposition of another estate, of an interest of the same legal or equitable quality, to his heirs, or heirs of his body, as a class \u25a0of persons to take in succession, from generation to generation, the limitation to the heirs entitles the ancestor to the whole estate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">The construction given to the words \u201cheirs\u201d or \u201cheirs of the body\u201d imputes to the grantor an intention to use them in their legal sense, and they are regarded as conclusive evidence of the intent of the grantor notwithstanding it may be \u25a0contrary to the real intention. One of the exceptions to this rule is that where the grantor or testator annexes to the word \u201cheirs\u201d other words indicating that he intended to^ use the term in a qualified sense, as a designation of certain individuals, and that <em>they </em>and not the ancestor were to be the points or <em>termini </em>from which the succession to the estate was to take its start, then the word \u201cheir\u201d is to be treated as a word of purchase. Eor instance it is said that the words \u201cheirs now living,\u201d \u201cchildren,\u201d \u201cissues,\u201d etc., are words of limitation or purchase according to1 the manifest intention of the grantor. <em>Ware </em>v. Richardson, 3 Md. 505; <em>Handy </em>v. <em>McKim, </em>64 Md. 560.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>While the word <em>heirs, </em>in the absence of some qualifying expression annexed to it, is under the rule treated as a word of limitation, the word <em>\u201cchildren\u201d </em>also has a well-recognized meaning, and unless the context clearly shows it to be otherwise intended, it signifies immediate offspring, and is a word of <em>purchase </em>and not a word of <em>limitation. Stump </em>v. <em>Jordan, </em>54 Md. 619; <em>Reilly </em>v. <em>Bristow, </em>105 Md. 326.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">In <em>Stump </em>v. <em>Jordan, supra, </em>Judge Milleb said: \u201cThe devise after the life estate, is not to the \u2018heirs/ nor to the \u2018issue/ but to the \u2018children\u2019 of the life tenant, if she have any. In its ordinary and popular signification the word \u2018children\u2019 means immediate offspring-, and such in general is its legal construction. It is a word of <em>purchase </em>and not of <em>limitation, </em>unless the context clearly shows it to be otherwise intended. The cases in which it has a broader signification, and where if has been held synonymous with \u2018heirs\u2019 or \u2018issue\u2019 or \u2018descendants/ are well illustrated by the resolutions in <em>Wild's Case, </em>6 Co. 17. In that ease, says Lobd Ooke, \u2018it was resolved for good law that if A. devises his lands to' B. <em>and his children </em>or issues, and he hath not any issue at the time; of the' devise, the same is an estateTail; for the intent of the testator is manifest and certain that his children or issue should take, and as immediate devisees they can not take because They are not <em>rerum natura, </em>and by way of remainder they can not take, for that was not his intent, for the gift is immediate, therefore such words shall be taken as words of limitation, <em>scilicet </em>as much as children or issue of his body.\u2019 In such a case there is no' difficulty in discovering the plain intent or discerning the reason why the word \u2018children\u2019 should have the same effect as the word \u2018heirs.\u2019 The distinction between the case put and one like this-, is clearly stated by the other resolution in the same case, which is this: \u2018But it was resolved that if a man, as in the case at bar, devises land to husband and wife, and after their decease to their children or the remainder to their children, in this case although they have not any child at the time, yet every child <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>which they shall have after, may talc\u00a9 by way of remainder, according to the rule of law; for his intent appears that their children should not take immediately, but after the decease of the husband and wife.\u2019 \u201d After referring to the argument that the succeeding words of the testator, \u201cin the event, however, of her death without lawful issue, I give and bequeath the said land to my next kindred by law,\u201d had the effect of enlarging the meaning of the word \u201cchildren\u201d previously used, from a word of <em>purchase </em>to a word of limitation, and, therefore to give the first taker an estate tail, Judge Miller said further: \u201cBut to this we cannot yield our assent. In the devise after* the life estate the testator has used the most appropriate word, and the one usually adopted in order to avoid the operation of the rule in <em>Shelley's Case, </em>and to enable the children to take as purchasers, and prevent the ancestor from depriving them of the estate by alienation.\u201d In the case of <em>Reilly </em>v. <em>Bristow, supra, </em>the limitation over was in the following words: \u201cTo go and he divided between the children the lawful heirs of my aforesaid children.\u201d After referring to the argument of the appellees\u2019 counsel that the'words lawful heirs explained and enlarged the preceding word, children, Judge Pearce said: \u201cWhere, as here, there are two possible constructions, one of which would enlarge and the other would restrict the meaning of the word <em>children, </em>we think the spirit of our decisions requires us to adopt the .restrictive construction which will give effect to the natural and primary meaning of the word, rather than the arbitrary meaning placed upon it by an artificial rule of law.\u201d In the case of <em>Hall </em>v. <em>Gradwohl, </em>113 Md. 293, where the will provided that after the death of the life tenant the property should be equally divided \u201camong her children or heirs\u201d the Court held that the words \u201cchildren or heirs\u201d were words of purchase, and Judge Burke, referring to the contention that the rule in <em>Shelley's Case </em>applied, said: \u201cBy that construction her \u2018children or legal heirs\u2019 would take nothing under the will, and the whole portion which the tes<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>tator intended his daughter to take for life would he taken by lier absolutely. Such a construction, which has neither reason, policy, justice, nor equity to support it, can only be sustained by giving the words \u2018legal heirs,\u2019 which are super-added to the word children, the arbitrary meaning placed upon them \u2018by an artificial rule of law.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">In the ease at bar the deed provides that after the death of Mrs. J ohnson the property is to he held in trust \u201cfor all and every the children the said Mary W. J ohnson now has or the children she may hereafter have, * * * the issue of any deceased child of said Mary W. Johnson, if any such issue there should he, to take the part or proportion only to which the parent of such issue if living would be entitled.\u201d Here the wof'd <em>heirs </em>is not used, and there is nothing in the context to suggest that the grantor intended the words \u201cchild or children\u201d to have any other than their ordinary meaning. To treat, these words as words of limitation would he contrary to the manifest purpose of the grantor to convey to Mrs. J ohn - son only a life estate in the property, and the remainder to her children and their issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">The ease of <em>Cook </em>v. <em>Councilman, </em>109 Md. 622, on which the appellant relies, is very different. There the limitation over in default of children was to the heirs of the devisee ot the life estate, and Judge Bbiscoe said: \u201cBut in the case of the devise we are now considering the word \u2018heirs\u2019 is used as wel 1 as the word \u2018children,\u2019 and that word is strictly a word of limitation. The ultimate gift over to the heirs of Councilman in default of children indicates a general intent that the estate should descend to his heirs and operates to enlarge the effect of the word \u2018children\u2019 antecedently used.\u201d As we have said, the deed in this ease contains no words that can operate to enlarge the effect of the word \u2018children.\u2019 On the contrary, the terms employed are those usually adopted to avoid the rule in <em>Shelley\u2019s Case, </em>and to enable the children of the life tenant to take the remainder as <em>purchasers. </em>The intent to make <em>them, </em>and not their mother, \u201cthe root of succession from which future takers should come\u201d is clear, and there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>is no rule of law or of construction that can deprive them of the estate. In this view of the case it is not necessary to determine whether the life estate of Mrs. Johnson was converted by the Statute of Uses unto a legal estate, or whether the rule enforced in <em>Handy </em>v. <em>McKim, supra, </em>still applies in this State.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">Having determined that Mrs. Johnson has only a life estate in the property, the next question to be considered is, Did her children by uniting in the deed convey to Charles L. Solley the remainder in fee simple?</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">In the case of <em>Stump </em>v. <em>Jordan, supra, </em>where the property was devised to Catherine J. Edie for life, and \u201cat her death # * to her children if she have any,\u201d Judge Millek said: \u201cIf therefore the clause had stopped with the devise \u2018to her children, if any she have,\u2019 it is beyond doubt that in \u25a0 this State, since the Act of 1825, Oh. 119. the mother would have taken a life estate, and any child or children she might have had, would have taken a remainder in fee. It is well settled that where a life estate is carved out with a gift over to the children of the life tenant, or the children of any other person, such gift will embrace not only the objects living at the death of the testator, but all who may subsequently come into existence before the period of distribution, and in cases falling under this rule, the children, if any, living at the death of the testator, take an immediately vested interest in their shares^ subject to the diminution of those shares <em>(i. &amp;., </em>to their being divested <em>pro tanto) </em>as the number of objects is augmented by future births during* the life of the tenant for life, and consequently on the death of any of the children during the life of the tenant for life, their shares, (if their interests therein are transmissible) devolve to their respective representatives.\u201d In the case of <em>Cox </em>v. <em>Handy, </em>78 Md. 108, the testator devised certain property to his wife for life and directed that after her death it should be divided \u201camongst my children, share and share alike, the child or children of any deceased child to take the portion to which the parent, if living, would have been entitled,\u201d and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>Judge Bbyan, after stating that it was \u201csettled that where a particular estate is given, and there is a gift over to children, this gift will emhra.ce the children living at the death of the testator, and all who may subsequently come into existence before the period of distribution,\u201d and after reviewing many decisions bearing upon the question, said: \u201cIn view of these authorities, we think that we are justified in holding that a share of the property vested in each of the children of William W. Handy (the testator) who survived him, but if any such child should leave children at his&gt; death his share was divested in favor of his children; and that it, was not divested by the death of the child in the lifetime of the tenant for life without leaving children. * * * In <em>Engel\u2019s Case (Engel </em>v. <em>State, use of Geiger, </em>65 Md. 539,) the Court said that it was unmistakably clear that the testator intended to substitute the child of the legatee who might die, in the place of the parent.\u201d In disposing of a motion for reargument Judge, Beyayt said further: \u201cA share of the property vested in each of the children who were living at the time of his (testator\u2019s) death, and if any child died before the period of distribution leaving children, they were <em>substituted </em>in his place; his share, however, was not divested if he left no children, but it went to his, representatives.\u201d In that case the Court also held that the children of a child who died before the testator took their parent\u2019s, share. The statements of Judge Bkyatc were quoted with approval in the case of <em>Hoover </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>96 Md. 393. In the case of <em>In re Roger\u2019s Trust Estate, </em>97 Md. 675, the will directed the executor to convert the entire estate into money, and after paying debts, etc., to transfer what remained to a trustee to invest the same and pay the, interest thereon to the testator\u2019s wife during her life, and after her death to divide the securities and interest amongst the testator\u2019s children, and provided that \u201cin said division, the child or children of a deceased parent, if there be such, are to take in equal proportion, the share to which that deceased parent would have been entitled had he or she lived at the time of said division.\u201d The widow of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>the testator released all her interest in the trust fund, and his children filed a hill to procure a division of the fund on the ground that in consequence of the release an acceleration of the remainder had resulted, and that they were entitled to a division of the trust estate. This Oourt, in affirming the decree of the lower Oourt dismissing the hill, said: \u201cBy the terms of the will, it seems to be clear that his children took vested interests in the estate in equal proportions defeasible as to the share of any one of them upon his or her death in the lifetime of the widow; and in this event the share of the person so dying would become vested in his or her children. <em>Cox </em>v. <em>Handy, </em>78 Md. 108. The period at which the division among the remaindermen is to take place as fixed by the 'will, is after the death of Mrs. Rogers; and if at that time, one of the children is deceased leaving a child or childi\u2019en then living, such child or children must be substituted in his place; but if the child so dying leaves no children, his share is not divested but. goes to his personal representatives. <em>Cox </em>v. <em>Handy, </em>78 Md. 125. We do not understand that the appellants by their counsel, dispute these conclusions. With this construction of the will it is impossible to ascertain with precision the person or persons who will be entitled to take at the period of the death of Mrs. Rogers the life tenant. That event is yet in the future, and it is not possible to determine who may be entitled when it shall arrive. The testator desired that his estate should pass to all his children share and share alike, but if any one of them is deceased at the period of his wife\u2019s death, the children or child of such deceased child shall take; and if there be no such child or children, inasmuch as the estate vested in the deceased child would not become divested by death, his share would go to his legal representatives. So that, it seems clear that if the estate be divided at the present time while Mrs. Rogers is still living the result might ensue that the several portions of the estate will finally become vested in persons other than those contemplated by the testator, and in direct contravention of his will.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b265-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>Row the deed in question provides that \u201cfrom and after\u2019' tlic death of Mrs. Johnson the property is. to he held in trust \u201cfor all and every the children\u201d shei \u201cnow has or the child or children she may hereafter have, * * * the issue of any deceased child * * * if any such issue there should be, to take the part or proportion only to which the parent of sucli issue if living woirld he entitled,\u201d and unless the words \u201cfrom, and after\u201d show that the grantor intended to postpone the vesting of the remainder until the death of Mrs. Johnson, the case falls clearly within the rule referred to, and upon the execution and delivery of the deed, each of the children of Mrs. J olmson then living took a vested interest in the property. The share of each child was liable to be diminished in order to include any child Mrs. Johnson might thereafter have, and the interest of each child was subject to- be divested only by his or her deatli, during the lifetime of Mrs. Johnson, leaving issue, who by the terms of the grant, take the share \u201cto which the parent of such issue if living would ho entitled.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">There are cases holding that words- like the words- \u201cfrom and immediately after\u201d the death of the life tenant express the intention of the testator or grantor to defer the vesting of the remainder until that period. <em>Larmour v. Rich, </em>71 Md. 369; <em>Poultney </em>v. <em>Tiffany, </em>112 Md. 630. But here the words \u201cfrom and after\u201d are followed by an express grant to the children Mrs. Johnson <em>\u201cnow has,\u201d </em>which show that the grantor intended each of the children of Mrs. Johnson living at the time the deed was executed and delivered to take a <em>vested remainder, </em>subject to be <em>divested </em>only by his or her death, leaving issue, during the lifetime of Mrs. Johnson, and that the words \u201cfrom and after\u201d refer merely to the time of <em>enjoyment </em>of the estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">With this construction of the deed it is impossible to ascertain witli certainty the persons who will be; entitled to take the property at the death of Mrs. Johnson, and while the &gt; deed in question operated to transfer the interest and estate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>of the children who united therein provided they survive-their mother or die during her lifetime without leaving issue, it cannot effect the interest or share of any child who may die during the lifetime of Mrs. Johnson, the life tenant,, <em>leaving issue.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">The deed in this case does not differ in any material respect from the deeds construed in <em>Ware </em>v. <em>Richardson, supra, </em>and <em>Handy </em>v. <em>McKim, supra, </em>and following the ruling-in those cases, the remaindermen in the case at bar, by force-of the Statute of Uses, take <em>legal estates. </em>See also <em>Merritt </em>v. <em>Disney, </em>48 Md. 344; <em>Hooper </em>v. <em>Felgner, </em>80 Md. 262; <em>Graham </em>v. <em>Whitridge, </em>99 Md. 248, and 39 <em>Cyc. </em>219.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">The agreed statement of facts does not state <em>when </em>the child, referred to as \u201ca deceased child who died in infancy, without issue,\u201d died. If said child died <em>after </em>the deed from Mrs. Johnson and others was executed, his or her interest in the property did not pass- by that deed, but vested in his or her heirs at law.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-7\">In addition to the defects pointed out, the title of Charles-L. Solley and his assignee is subject to the further uncertainty, referred to by the Court below, arising out of the fact that Mrs. Johnson is still living. .The Court cannot say that she will not have other children to take vested interests in the property. <em>In re Ricard\u2019s Trust Estate, </em>97 Md. 608.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-8\">For the reasons stated the decree of the Court below sustaining the exception to the sale made by the appellant must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-9\"><em>Decree affirmed, with costs </em>to- <em>the appellees-..</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
