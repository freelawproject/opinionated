The first count charges, that \u201c'on or about the 24th day of January, 1913, the said defendants, their agents and servants did illegally and unlawfully have, keep and offer for sale, and did sell to the said plaintiff a certain medicinal or chemical preparation or liquid intended for internal use, lo wit, whiskey, in which methyl or wood alcohol was used, placed or contained in the stead of spirit, grain or ethyl alcohol, so that said medicinal or chemical preparation or liquid intended for internal use, called or1 known as whiskey, was dangerous and harmful to he drunk or used internally, which said danger and harm was known or by the exercise of reasonable care could have been known to the said defendants, their agents and servants: that the said plaintiff did not know and was not warned or informed of the harmful or dangerous ingredient or substance contained in said whiskey or liquid, and lie. the said plaintiff, did drink the same, whereby, by reason of said harmful substance or ingredient in said whiskey or liquid the said plaintiff was caused to suffer great and permanent physical hurt and injury, and to lose (or impair) the faculty of seeing or sense of sight and became blind,\u201d etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">The second count alleges that, the \u201cdefendants, their agents and servants, in making, manufacturing, mixing or compounding a certain medicine, medicinal or chemical preparation intended for internal use, to wit: AA'hiskev, did illegally and unlawfully substitute or use methyl or wood alcohol in the place and stead of spirit, grain or ethyl alcohol, so that said preparation or so-called whiskey or liquid Avas, and became so harmful and dangerous for internal use as to endanger the health of persons internally using the same (all of AA'hich the said defendants kneAv, or on account of the said substance being for internal use ought to have been known to the said defendants); that the said defendants, their agents or servants, did (intentionally, wrongfully and illegally offer for sale and sell or) fill certain bottles or glass receptacles with said substance or preparation and keep and offer the same for sale, and that on or about the 24th day of January, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>1913, the said plaintiff did innocently purchase certain of said preparation, and without knowledge or warning' as to the harmful or dangerous nature of the same, the said plaintiff did drink of said preparation to his great loss, injury and damage,\u201d etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">The third count alleges that the defendants \u201cdid (tortiously) illegally and unlawfully and intentionally have, keep and offer for sale and. did sell to the said plaintiff a certain medicinal or chemical preparation or liquid intended for internal use, to wit: whiskey, in which methyl or wood alcohol was used, placed or contained in the stead of spirit or ethyl alcohol,\u201d so that the said whiskey was dangerous &lt;cto&gt; he drunk or used internally,\u201d and that the plaintiff, not knowing that it was dangerous, did drink of said whiskey and was greatly injured, etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">The fourth count avers that the defendants, \u201ctheir agents and servants, made, had or kept and offered for sale a certain beverage, composition or mixture called or labeled whiskey, in the mixture or manufacture of which methyl or wood alcohol, which is of a dangerous and poisonous character so as to require great care in, its use and not to be used for internal purposes;, was (negligently, fraudulently and) wrongfully used in the place and stead of ethyl or grain or pure alcohol (a. much more expensive substance than methyl alcohol), and on or about the 24th day of January, 1913, a bottle or portion of said, so-called whiskey was sold to the said plaintiff for internal use,\u201d and that the plaintiff \u201cdid use and drink\u201d said mixture \u201cwithout suspicion or knowledge of said danger\u201d and by reason thereof became ill \u201cand lost the sight of his eyes,\u201d -etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-7\">The defendants demurred to the declaration, and the demurrer having been overruled, the docket entries state, \u201cpleas \u2018did not commit the wrongs alleged\u2019 were then entered short by all the defendants, and issue joined short.\u201d There was a judgment of <em>\u201cnon pros\u201d </em>as to the Sherwood Distilling Company which the appellee states in his brief was entered at the close of the plaintiff\u2019s testimony, and this appeal is by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>the other defendants, Vincent Flaccomio and Lee Sonnehorn, from the judgment against them in favor of the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">The record contains one hundred and fifty-two exceptions. One hundred and fifty-one of these relate to the rulings of the Court below on the evidence, and the remaining exception is to the overruling of special exceptions to the plaintiff\u2019s second and seventh prayers; to the granting of those prayers, and to the rejection of certain prayers of the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">The first, second, third, fourth and fifth prayers of Flaeoomio, and the five prayers of Sonnehorn asked for instructions that- under the pleadings there was no. evidence in the ease legally sufficient to entitle the plaintiff to recover on any of the counts in the declaration. The Court below granted these prayers of the defendant Sonnehorn in reference to the first, second and third counts, but rejected bis prayers, denying the plaintiff\u2019s right to recover on the fourth count. The Court also granted the1 prayer of Flaccomio in reference to the second count, but refused his prayers withdrawing the ease from the j ury on the first, third and fourth counts. The ruling of the Court, on these prayers presents the important and controlling question in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-7\">The evidence produced at the trial, assuming that all of it was admissible, shows or tends to show, that in January, 1913, the defendant, Vincent Flaccomio, kept a saloon in Baltimore City at (120 Forrest street. The plaintiff, who at that time lived at 704 Fast Monument street, near the corner of Forrest and Monument streets, went to Flaeoomio\u2019s saloon about seven o\u2019clock in the evening of January 24th and asked for a half pint, of \u201cSherwood Whiskey\u201d or \u201cSherwood live Whiskey,\u201d and received from the bartender a half pint bottle labeled \u201cSherwood .Rye Whiskey.\u201d He took the bottle to his home and he and several friends drank the contents. About a hour later, he went back to Flaccomio\u2019s saloon and asked for another half pint of \u201cSherwood Whiskey\u201d or \u201cSherwood Rye Whiskey\u201d and the bartender gave him a half pint bottle labeled as the first bottle was, and be and bis friends eou<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>sumed the contents of that bottle. The following afternoon the plaintiff became quite sick and partially blind, and was finally taken to the Presbyterian Eye, Ear and Throat Hospital on the 4th of February, 1913, where he remained for about sixty days, under treatment for loss of sight. The physician who attended him at the hospital stated at the trial that his loss of sight was due to wood alcohol poison, and that he wonld not recover from the effects of it. For the purpose of showing that the whiskey he got from Elaocomio\u2019s saloon contained wood alcohol, the plaintiff proved that several other bottles of Sherwood Whiskey purchased by different persons and at different times in February, 1913, from Flaceomio at his saloon on Forrest street contained thirty-five per cent, of wood alcohol. The record does not clearly show from whom Flaceomio got the whiskey that was sold to the plaintiff or the persons who purchased in February the bottles of whiskey containing thirty-five per cent, of wood alcohol. At one point in his testimony Flaceomio stated that at that time he was buying whiskey from the defendant, Lee Sonnebom &amp; Company, and from E. Bruce &amp; Co. At another time he said he was buying his Sherwood Whiskey prior to the sales in question from Lee Sonnebom &amp; Company, and later, when asked if he could tell from whom he got the whiskey sold to the plaintiff, he said he could not say. Flaceomio and his employees testified that he bought the Sherwood Whiskey that he sold in bottles in five and ten gallon demijohns. These demijohns when delivered to him had a card or tag attached to them bearing the name of the whiskey and the name of the person from whom he purchased them. The demijohns were placed in the room where he conducted his saloon, and the bottles were filled in that room from the demijohns as they were needed, and labeled, as to its contents, according to the tag on the demijohn. He got some of the labels from Sonnebom, and the bottles were purchased by bfm from a number of persons, and were always washed before they were filled with whiskey. They further testified that they never put anything in the whiskey, that they never <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>liad any wood alcohol at his saloon, and that Maccomio and his employees sold the whiskey just as it was when he received it, and never knew or had any reason to suspect that any of the whiskey they sold contained wood alcohol. Maccomio also testified that he had been buying whiskey from Lee Sonnebom &amp; Company for a number of years; that before he began to purchase from Lee Sonnebom he learned that he was a reliable merchant, and that he had never heard of any complaints about the whiskey that he, Maccomio, sold until the complaint in this case. The record shows that wood alcohol in taste, odor and intoxicating\" effect \u201cvery closely\u201d resembles the ordinary grain alcohol, and there is no evidence to show that its presence in whiskey can be detected except by a chemical analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">In respect to the defendant Sonnebom, the evidence shows that he was in the wholesale liquor business, and had been in that business .for eleven years. He bought his whiskey in barrel lots, and in the years 1911, 1912 and 1913 he purchased'Ms Sherwood Whiskey from A. J. &amp; A. Freiburg, of Cincinnati, Ohio; II. H. Shufelt of Peoria, Illinois, and the Meichman Company of Cincinnati, Ohio. He had dealt with these parties ever1 since he had been in business, and they were merchants of the highest reputation. The name of the whiskey was marked on the barrel, and when the barrels of whiskey ai\u2019e received by him they are rolled in on the floor of his building and are kept there until they are needed.. When the whiskey is needed in his business a spigot is inserted in the barrel, and the barrel is placed on the rack, and when he gets an order for less than a barrel of whiskey, lie makes out a ticket, bearing the name of the purchaser, the name of the whiskey and the quantity desired, and places the ticket on the proper barrel, and then sees that the receptacles are properly filled from the barrel. The demijohns in which he sells the whiskey are \u201cfilled from the original barrels just as he got them\u201d from the parties from whom he purchases;, and the demijohns are then tightly corked and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>loaded on Ms- wagon for immediate delivery to Iris customers. When these demijohns are returned by his customers they are immediately put into a. tank \u201cand soaked and rinsed thoroughly and then corked,\u201d and when they are needed they are. again \u201crinsed\u201d before they are filled. Sonneborn and his employees further testified that he was not a \u201crectifier\u201d oi\u201cblender\u201d of spirits, or a. manufacturer of liquors; that ho dealt in liquors as a. \u201cjobber\u201d; that he never had any wood alcohol on his premises, never sold any whiskey containing wood alcohol, and had never had any complaints of any kind about the whiskey he sold.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">As to the defendant Sonneborn, it would seem clear upon this state of the proof that there was- no evidence legally sufficient to entitle the plaintiff to recover on any of the counts in the declaration. If we assume that there was evidence to show that the whiskey that the plaintiff got from Flaccomio\u2019s saloon contained wood alcohol, and that Flaccomio purchased the whiskey from Lee Sonneborn &amp; Company, there is not the slightest evidence to show that Sonneborn or his agents knew, or by the exercise, of reasonable care could have known that it contained wood alcohol, or that he or his agents were guilty of negligence either in the purchase or sale of the whiskey. lie was not the distiller or manufacturer; or blender or rectifier of the whiskey he sold F'laecomio, but he simply sold in smaller quantities the whiskey he purchased, in large quantities. In the absence of some evidence. that Sonneborn or his agents knew of the presence of wood alcohol, or of some evidence of fraud, deceit or negligence on his or their part, there is no ground or principle' upon which he could be held liable under the pleadings in the case for the injury the plaintiff sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">The cases relied on by the appellee do not warrant a different conclusion, but in our judgment fully sustain this view. Tn the case of <em>Thomas </em>v. <em>Winchester, </em>6 N. Y. 397, the action was1 brought to recover damages \u201cfor negligently putting up., labeling and selling as and for the extract of <em>dando</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number><em>Hon, </em>which is a simple and harmless medicine, a jar of tho extract of <em>belladonna, </em>which is a deadly poison; by means of which the plaintiff, * * * to whom * * * a dose of dandelion was prescribed by a physician, and a portion of the contents of the jar, was administered as and for the extract of dandelion, was greatly injured,\u201d etc. The medicine was purchased by the plaintiff\u2019s husband at the store of Dr. Foord, a physician and druggist in Madison 'County, where, the plaintiff lived. It was sold for and believed by I)r. Foord to be the extract of dandelion, and he purchased it as the extract of dandelion from J. S. Aspinwall, a druggist in Yew York, and Aspinwall bought it from the defendant as the extract of dandelion, believing it to be such. The defendant was engaged at Yo. 108 John street, Yew York, in the manufacture and sale of certain vegetable extracts\u2019 for medicinal purposes, and in the purchase and sale of others. The extracts manufactured by him were put up in jars for sale, and those he purchased were put up in like manner. The jars containing extracts manufactured by himself and those containing extracts purchased from others, were labeled alike. Both were labeled like the jar in question, as \u201cprepared by A. Gilbert.\u201d Gilbert was a person employed by the defendant at a salary, as an assistant in his business. The extract-contained in the jar sold to Aspinwall, and by him to Boord, was not manufactured by the defendant, bul w\u00edu purchased by him from another manufacturer or dealer. \u201cThe extract of dandelion and the extract of belladonna resemble, each other in color, consistence', smell and taste; hut may on careful examination be distinguished the one from the. other by those who are well acquainted with these articles.\u201d Gilbert\u2019s labels were paid for by Winchester, the defendant, and used in his business with his knowledge and assent. The defendant. moved for a nonsuit on several grounds. The first of these, grounds was, \u201cThat the action could not he sustained, as the defendant was the remote vendor of tho article in question; and there was no connection, transaction or privity he-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>tween him and the plaintiff\u201d; and the sixth ground was, \u201cThat there was no sufficient evidence of negligence- in the defendant to go to the jury.\u201d The lower Court charged the jury that if Aspinwall, Eoord and Mr. Thomas were free from negligence, and if the defendant was guilty of negligence in putting up and vending the extract in question the plaintiff was entitled to recover, provided the extract administered to the plaintiff was the same put up- by the defendant and sold by him to Aspinwall and by Aspinwall to Eoord. In sustaining the instruction granted by the lower Court, the Court of Appeals of New York, speaking through Chtee Judge Ruggles, said: \u201cThe case depends on the first point taken by the defendant on his motion for a nonsuit; and the question is, whether the defendant, being a remote vendor of the medicine, and there being no privity or connection between him and the plaintiff, the action can be maintained.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">\u201cIf, in labeling a poisonous drug with the name of a harmless medicine, for public market, no duty was violated by the defendant, excepting that which he owed to Aspinwall, his immediate vendee, in virtue of his contract of sale, this action can not be maintained. If A. build a wagon and sell it to B., who sells it to C., and C. hires it to D., who in consequence of the gross negligence of A. in building the wagon is overturned and injured, D. can not recover damages against A., the builder. A.\u2019s obligation to build the wagon faithfully, arises solely out of his contract with B. The public have nothing to do with it. Misfortune to third persons, not parties to the contract, would not be a natural and necessary consequence of the builder\u2019s negligence; and such negligence is not an act imminently dangerous to human life * * *.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">\u201cBut the case in hand stands on a different ground. The defendant was a dealer in poisonous drugs. Gilbert was his agent in preparing them for- market. The death or great bodily harm of some person was the natural and almost inevitable consequence- of the sale of belladonna by means of the false label. Gilbert, the defendant\u2019s agent, would have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>been punishable for manslaughter if Mrs. Thomas had died in consequence of talcing the falsely labeled medicine. Every man who, by his culpable negligence, causes the death of another, although without intent- to kill, is guilty of manslaughter. * * * A chemist who negligently sells laudanum in a vial labeled as paregoric, and thereby causes the death of a person to whom it is administered, is guilty of manslaughter. -* * -x- jn j-eppeq f0 the wrongful and criminal character of the negligence complained of, this case differs widely from those put by the defendant\u2019s counsel. No such imminent danger existed in those cases. * * The defendant\u2019s negligence put human iife in imminent danger. * * * In <em>Longmeid </em>v. <em>Holliday </em>(6 English Law and Eq. Rep. 562), the distinction is recognized between an act of negligence imminently dangerous to the lives of others, and one that is not so. In the former case, the party guilty of the negligence is liable to the paify injured, whether there he a contract between them or not; in the latter, the negligent paify is liable only to the party with whom he contracted, and on the ground that negligence is a breach of the contract.\u201d We have quoted from Thomas vs. Winchester at some length because it is referred to by the appellee, and in many of the later cases, as the leading case on the subject, and because it shows conclusively that the plaintiff\u2019s right to' recover was based on tho averment and proof of the defendant\u2019s <em>negligence </em>in labeling and selling a deadly poison.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">In the case of <em>Hoover et al. </em>v. <em>Peters, </em>18 Mich. 51, where the purchaser, who purchased for consumption, was allowed to recoup for meat that was unsound on the ground of an implied warranty of soundness, the Court said in reference to sales to a <em>dealer: </em>\u201cIt seems to be settled by many authorities that no implied warranty of soundness arises where such articles are purchased by a dealer to sell again.\u201d In the case of <em>Boyd </em>v. <em>Coca-Cola Bottling Works, </em>177 S. W. Rep. 80, suit was brought against the Bottling Works for injuries caused by its negligence1 in selling a bottle of coca-cola in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>which there was a cigar <em>stub, </em>and the Supreme Court of Tennessee in its opinion said: \u201cPractically all of the modern cases are to the effect that the ultimate consumer of foods, medicines and beverages may bring this action against the manufacturer for injuries caused by the negligent preparation of such articles.\u201d In the case of <em>Crigger </em>v. <em>The Coca-Cola Bottling </em>Company, 179 S. W. Rep. 155, where the suit was instituted to recover for injuries caused by drinking a bottle of coca.-cola, sold by the defendant, to a dealer and by him sold to the plaintiff, containing a decomposed mouse, the Supremo Court of Tennessee, after a careful review of the authorities in that and other States, said: \u201cThis liability is based on an omission of duty or act of negligence, and the way should be left open for the innocent to escape. However exacting the duty or1 high the degree of care to furnish pure foods., beverages and medicines;, Ave believe with Judge Cooley, as expressed in <em>Brown v. </em>Marshall, <em>supra </em>(47 Mich. 576), that negligence is a necessary element in the right of action, and the better authorities have not gone so far as to dispense with actual negligence as a prerequisite to the lia,bility. In fact, there is no logical basis of liability for personal injury without some negligent act or omission.\u201d In <em>Norton </em>v. Sewall, 106 Mass. 143, the Court, in sustaining the: judgment for the plaintiff said: \u201cUpon the allegations of the1 declaration, and the statements in the bill of exceptions, the jury must be taken to. have found that the defendant, an apothecary, by his servant, negligently sold, as and for tincture of rubarb (a Avell-known and harmless medicine.), two ounces of laudanum, a dangerous and deadly poison, to Patten, who procured it for the purpose of administering it, and did administer two ounces of it, as a medicine, to his servant, the plaintiff\u2019s intestate, from the effects of which he died.\u201d In all of the, other well considered eases relied on by the appellee it Avill be found upon careful examination that where the suit was not against the immediate vendor' the right to recover was based upon some averment and evidence of guilty knowl<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>edge, fraud, deceit or negligence of the defendant or his agents, or some: statute imposing absolute liability upon the manufacturer or vendor of the article in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">The only case in this State having any hearing upon the question here involved is the case of <em>State, use of Hartlove, </em>v. <em>Fox, </em>79 Md. 514, where a suit was brought to recover for the death, of Tlatflove, alleged to have been caused by glanders contracted from a horse purchased by the decedent's brother from Fox, and where this Court, after reviewing many of the cases relied on by the appellee in this ease, said through the present Chief Judge: \u201cWe have referred to a number of cases which present various phases of such questions as may reflect upon the one before us. Without deeming it necessary to pass upon all of them or to go to the full extent that <em>Thomas </em>v. <em>Winchester </em>has gone, we are of the opinion that the authorities and a proper regard for the protection of innocent persons fully justify us in the conclusion that if a vendor sells any property which he knows to he imminentlv dangerous to human beings and likely to cause injury to an innocent vendee wbo is not aware of the danger and to whom false representations have been made as an inducement, to the sale he may under proper allegation and proof, be held responsible not only to the vendee, but to such person or persons as the vendee may in the ordinary course of events call upon to take charge of the property for him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">There is no allegation of a breach of warranty in any of the counts in the declaration, and even if there was, Sonneborn did. not sell to the plaintiff, and the cases to which we have referred and others cited by the appellee recognize the established rule that the action cannot be maintained on the theory of an implied warranty where there is no privity of contract. In the case of <em>Roberts </em>v. <em>Anheuser-Busch Brewing Association, </em>211 Mass. 449, 98 N. E. 95, in a suit to recover for ptomaine poisoning from a bottle of Malt ITutrine, the Court said: \u201cWhile there may be no inherent difficulty in maintaining an action of tort upon a false warranty, it yet <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>remains true that there cannot he a warranty where there is no privity of contract. It cannot he found that there was a particular contract when there was no contract whatever. If there has been no contractual relation between the plaintiff and defendant, the action cannot be maintained upon the ground that there was any warranty by the defendant of- the good quality of its mixture. <em>Davidson </em>v. <em>Nichols, </em>11 Allen, 514. Nor did the plaintiff state such a cause of action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">It is said in 1 <em>Shearman &amp; Redfield on Negligence, </em>sec. 13, that the violation of a statute, \u201cestablished for the benefit of private persons,\u201d is itself sufficient to prove such a breach of duty as will sustain a private action for negligence, if the other elements of actionable negligence concur, and that the true rule in such cases is that the violation is presumptive evidence of negligence, and the plaintiff contends that the defendants have violated sec. 211 of Article 21, Yol. 3 of Bagby\u2019s Code, which provides that: \u201cAny person, firm or corporation engaged in the business of making, manufacturing, compounding- or dispensing drugs, medicines, medicinal or chemical preparations for human consumption, who shall in person or by his, their or its agents or employees, make, mix, manufacture, compound, dispense, sell, or deliver 'to any person, any drug, medicine, medicinal or chemical preparation, intended for internal use, wherein ethyl, or grain alcohol usually enters as a part of, or is in anywise employed in the making, mixing or manufacture, compounding or preparation of such drugs, medicine, medicinal or chemical preparation; who shall, in the making, mixing, manufacturing or compounding of such drug, medicine or medicinal or chemical preparation, substitute or use, in part or in whole, methyl, or wood alcohol, in the place and stead of ethyl, or grain alcohol or who shall in anjr manner put or introduce methyl, or wood alcohol, into such drug, medicine or medicinal or chemical preparation shall be guilty of a misdemeanor,\u201d etc. Even if it could be said that the defendants were \u201cengaged in the business of making, manufacturing, compounding or dispens<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>ing drugs, medicines, medicinal or chemical preparations\u201d there is no evidence in the case that they mixed, made, manufactured or compounded the whiskey sold to the plaintiff or that they introduced wood alcohol into the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">I\u00cd; is the dirty of every person to so conduct his business as not to knowingly or negligently expose others to imminent danger, and where an injury is sustained in consequence of tlie violation of that duty, without any negligence on the part of ihe party injured, justice demands that the guilty party should he held responsible. And there may he cases where the presence of a dangerous ingredient in the article sold may in itself justify an inference of negligence on the part of the defendant. Dnt such an inference is not warranted where a merchant deals in an article not generally regarded or known to be dangerous and simply sells it in the condition in which he buys it, without any reason to suspect, or any means of detecting the presence of the dangerous quality except by a chemical analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">What we have said in reference to the evidence in regard to Sonneborn applies to1 the defendant Flaccomio'. There is no evidence that he or his agents knew that the whiskey contained wood alcohol, or that they were guilty of negligence in handling' or selling it. According to the proof in the case the bottles were filled from the demijohns in which he purchased the whiskey, and it was sold in the condition in which he hougiij, it.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-7\">In 1 <em>Elliott on </em>Contracts, 222, it is said: \u201cIf food is sold to the purchaser to he used directly for domestic consumption, there is, as between the dealer and consumer, an implied warranty that the articles are sound ana wholesome and fit for the purposes for which they were sold.\u201d Many of the earlier cases in support of this general statement of the rule are collected in a note to <em>Hunter </em>v. <em>State, </em>73 Am. Dec. 164, and some of the later eases dealing with the same question aro referred to in 11 <em>R. C. L., </em>pp. 1118-1121, and 35 <em>Cyc. </em>406-407.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>Sections 35 and 36 of Art. 83 of the Code of 1912, which are a codification of sections 32 and 33 of the Uniform Sales Act of 1910, Oh. 346, however provide: \u201c35.

B. 610, the action was brought to recover damag.es for a breach of warranty in respect to beer bought by the plaintiff in the beer house of the defendant and consumed on the premises. \u201cThe house was a tied house, and the only beer supplied was that of Messrs. Holden &amp; Oo'., Limited. The plaintiff was aware of this fact, and in his evidence he said that when he went to the defendant\u2019s house he expected to get Holden\u2019s beer and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>nothing else. The allegation was that the beer contained arsenic, and that he had suffered from arsenic poisoning.\u2019' The jury found that the plaintiff did not rely for the good quality of the heer on the skill and judgment of the defendant. Loan Justicie Vaughan Williams, alter quoting subsections 1 and 2 of the English Sale of Goods Act of 1893, which are the same as sub-sections 1 and 2 of sec. 3(5 of Art. 83 of our Code, said: \u201cSpeaking candidly, I do not think, talcing the generally accepted view of lawyers as to the meaning to he attached to the words, \u2018by description\u2019 as applied to a sale, ibat a sale of goods over a counter, where the seller deals in the description of goods sold, is a sale of goods by description within this sub-section. But in this case we have to consider the findings of the jury. They departed from their first finding, that the customer did rely on the skill and judgment of the seller, and adopted the suggestion of the learned judge that the plaintiff went to this beer bouse in which Holden\u2019s beer was kept for the purpose of sale, and asked to be supplied with beer of that description. The reason of the jury for ultimately saying that the plaintiff did not rely on the skill and judgment of the defendant was that the plaintiff was asking for beer of a specific description. Under these circumstances, and in this particular ease, though the sale was one of beer in a beer house, if the finding of the jury is accepted there was a sale by description. If so, there was an implied warranty under sub-section 2 that the goods should bo of a merchantable quality. This beer, by reason of the presence in it of arsenic, was not of a merchant able quality.\u201d Lokd J ustick Stirling said that he was of the same opinion, and Lord Justice Mathew said: \u201cI am of the same opinion. * * * The section wo are concerned with is section 14. This case, in view of tho finding of the jury that the plaintiff did not rely on the skill and judgment of the seller, cannot he brought within sub-section 1, but in my judgment it comes within the plain words of sub-section 2. The purchase by the plaintiff was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>of goods bought by description from a seller who dealt in goods of that description, and it was an implied condition that the goods should be of a merchantable quality. The case does not come within the proviso, for the defect was not one that examination could reveal. It is not, to my mind, any answer to the case set up by the plaintiff that the goods were bought across the counter. I agree, therefore, that the verdict for the plaintiff ought to stand.\u201d In the case of <em>Quemahoning Coal Co. </em>v. <em>Sanitary E. S. Co., </em>95 Atl. 986, the Court of Errors and Appeals of Hew Jersey held that in <em>s. </em>contract to sell a quantity of a certain kind of coal gotten from certain mines and known by the trade name of \u201cRandolph Smokeless Coal,\u201d came under sub-section 4 of the Sales Act relating to sales of a specific article under its patent or other trade name, and that there was no implied warranty as to its fitness for any particular purpose. In the cases of <em>Gearing </em>v. <em>Berkson, et al., </em>111 N. E. 785, the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts quotes sub-sections 1 and 3 of the Sales Act and then says: \u201cEven before the enactment of this statute, it was recognized as the law in this commonwealth, that where the buyer at a shop relies on the skill and judgment of the dealer in selecting food, and it is made known to the dealer that his knowledge and skill are relied on to supply wholesome food, he is liable if it is not fit to be eaten; while, in case the buyer himself selects provisions, the dealer\u2019s implied warranty does not go beyond the implied assertion that he believes the food to be sound. *'\u25a0* * .The application of this rule of law to the facts as found by the trial judge is decisive in the action of Percy A. Gearing. Ilis wife, acting as his agent, left to the defendant the selection of the meat, and paid for it at the current price for sound, wholesome pork chops. See <em>Hunt </em>v. <em>Rhodes Bros. Co., </em>207 Mass. 30, 92 N. E. 1001. The defendant Freshman undertook to make the selection so left to him. The meat was cooked, and was eaten by the plaintiff and his wife, and both were made sick 'because of the unwholesome, unsound. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>poisonous or unfit quality or condition of said pork chops.\u2019 The order of tlie Appellate Division in this action must be affirmed. In the action of the wife, Katherine Gearing, the Appellate Division ordered judgment for the plaintiff on the first count of her declaration, and from this the defendants appealed. The count is apparently framed in contract, for breach of an implied warranty or condition of fitness for food. The declaration purports to be \u2018in tort,\u2019 presumably on the theory that an action of tort may be maintained upon a false warranty. The difficulty with the case on this ground is that there was no contractual relation, and hence no warranty, between Mrs. Gearing and the defendants. The only sale was that made to her husband through her as his agent; and a cause of action in contract accrued to him thereon, as above set forth. The implied warranty, or to speak more accurately, the implied condition of the contract, to supply an article fit for the purpose required, is in the nature of a contract of personal indemnity with the original purchaser. It does not \u2018run with the goods.\u2019 \u201d After referring to the second count in Mrs. Gearing\u2019s case, which was in tort for negligence, the Court further said: \u201cBut that is controlled by the finding of the judge, that no negligence in fact was shown on the part of the defendants. In the absence both of an implied warranty and of negligence on the part of the defendants, the action of Mrs. Gearing fails.\u201d In <em>Wasserstron </em>v. <em>Cohen, Frank &amp; Co., </em>165 App. Div. 171, 150 N. Y. Supp. 638, it was held, that to bring a case within the Sales Act, sub-section 1, it must appear that the seller was informed expressly or by implication of the purpose for which the goods were purchased, and that the buyer relied on the seller\u2019s skill and judgment, and in <em>Kansas City Bolt and Nut Co. </em>v. <em>Rudd. </em>220 Fed. 750, the Court said that subsections 1 and 4 of the Sales Act enact the common law rule unless section 1 substitutes a question of fact for the presumption that the buyer relied on the seller\u2019s skill and judgment. We have referred to the above cases as showing the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>views of the Courts mentioned as to the proper application of the provisions of the Act in question, and we may refer also to the cases of <em>Warren Glass Co. </em>v. <em>Keystone Co., </em>65 Md. 547; <em>Farren </em>v. <em>Dameron, </em>99 Md. 323, and <em>Com. Realty Co. </em>v. <em>Dorsey, </em>114 Md. 172, for a statement of the rule in this State without reference to the Uniform Sales Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">It'is clear that in order to recover for a breach of an implied warranty, or in an action of tort for a false warranty, the plaintiff must-by appropriate averments and proof bring the case within one of the sections of the Uniform Sales Act. There is, however, no allegation of a warranty of the article sold in any of the counts of the declaration in this case, and we are not, therefore, called upon to determine whether there \u25a0 is any evidence in the case to support such an averment.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">It follows from what has been said that there was error in the rejection of Flaceomio\u2019s first, second, fourth and fifth prayers, and in the rejection of the prayers of the defendant, S'onneborn, and the' judgment must, therefore, be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-7\">If the judgment was against S'onneborn alone we would reverse it without awarding a new trial, as there is no evidence in the record to sustain a verdict against him upon any theory of the case. .But as we cannot, according to the practice of this Court, award a new trial as to one of the defendants without awarding it as to both <em>(Ewing </em>v. <em>Rider, </em>125 Md., p. 156), we will reverse the judgment, without now awarding a new trial, but with leave to the appellee to apply to this Court for an order granting a new trial, and then determine whether it shall be awarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-8\">\n<em>Judgment reversed, with costs to the appellants.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
