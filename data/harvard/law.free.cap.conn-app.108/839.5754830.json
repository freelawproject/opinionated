We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-6\">E was bom on June 14, 2003. Weighing a mere three pounds, she spent her first month clinging to life at Saint Francis Hospital and Medical Center in Hartford due to her mother\u2019s admitted substance abuse while E was in \u00fatero. E\u2019s mother had a history of involvement with the department regarding substance abuse, prostitution, physical neglect, medical neglect and risk of injury concerning her four older children. She also had a history of depression and suicidal ideation for which she required hospitalization. As a result, an order of temporary custody and a petition alleging that E was neglected and uncared for was filed on her behalf when she was bom. On March 25, 2004, E was adjudicated neglected and was committed to the care and custody of the petitioner, the commissioner of children and families. The order of temporary custody was sustained shortly thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-7\">For the first ten months of her life, the identity of E\u2019s father was unknown. On April 29, 2004, a paternity test confirmed that the respondent was E\u2019s father.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-8\">The respondent was bom in the African nation of Ghana. In 2000, he relocated to the United States. At that time, the respondent had two daughters in Ghana, aged two and four. As the court found, \u201c[wjhen he left Ghana, [the respondent] abandoned his daughters . . . and has not seen them since.\u201d The respondent met E\u2019s mother in the summer of 2002. The respondent maintained that their relationship never was serious, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"842\">*842</page-number>describing it as \u201cnothing more than a sexual relationship on a few occasions that led to the conception of [E].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b868-6\">In an effort to gain custody of E, the respondent on August 19, 2004, voluntarily agreed to comply with thirteen specific steps issued by the court. That court order required the respondent (1) to keep all appointments set by or with the department and to cooperate with department home visits, announced or unannounced, and visits by E\u2019s court-appointed attorney or guardian ad litem; (2) to keep E\u2019s whereabouts and his own whereabouts known to the department, his attorney and the attorney for E; (3) to participate in counseling and to make progress toward the \u201cidentified treatment goals\u201d regarding his parenting skills; (4) to submit to substance abuse assessment and to follow recommendations regarding treatment; (5) to submit to random drug testing, the time and method of which shall be at the department\u2019s discretion; (6) to engage recommended service providers for parenting, individual and family counseling, in-home support services or substance abuse treatment; (7) to sign releases authorizing the department to communicate with service providers to monitor attendance, cooperation and progress toward identified goals, and for use in future proceedings before the court; (8) to secure or maintain adequate housing and legal income; (9) to have no substance abuse; (10) to have no involvement with the criminal justice system; (11) immediately to advise the department of any changes in the composition of the household so as to ensure that the change does not compromise the health and safety of E; (12) to maintain E within the state of Connecticut for the duration of this case except for temporary travel out of state with the authorization of the department or the court in advance; and (13) to visit E as often as the department permits.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"843\">*843</page-number>In its memorandum of decision, the court chronicled the various efforts made by the department to reunify the respondent with E: \u201cFrom April 29, 2004, to April 22,2005, the following service providers were contacted on the [respondent\u2019s] behalf: Family Development Center, Community Child Guidance Center, New Hope and Planned Parenthood. [The respondent] was either unable or unwilling to adjust his work schedule to accommodate an intake for any of these services; therefore, these services could not be put in place. [The respondent] began having supervised visits with [E] at [the department] in July, 2004. From July 2, 2004, to April 8, 2005, these visits continued even though they were reported as being detrimental to the well-being of [the] child. On December 8, 2004, [the mother] was seen in [the respondent\u2019s] apartment. On December 17, 2004, [the respondent] was instructed by [the department] that he was not to have contact with [the mother] and [that] if he were to continue to maintain contact, it would jeopardize reunification efforts with [the] child. On April 29, 2005, [the respondent] was asked if he had any contact with [the mother], but he denied such contact. He was aware that any contact with [the mother] would jeopardize his reunification with [the] child.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-6\">\u201cFrom April 22,2005, to February 8,2006, [the respondent and E] engaged in reunification and parenting programs with Abundant Families and [the Parent Infant Program]. Abundant Families characterized [E] as being \u2018hysterical\u2019 but reported that the interaction was appropriate. The Parent Infant Program reported visits between [E and the respondent] as being appropriate. These reports appear to be contradictory. On February 8, 2006, [E] was reunified with [the respondent]. On March 14, 2006, [the respondent and the mother] were involved in domestic violence, and [the respondent] was arrested for disorderly conduct and unlawful <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"844\">*844</page-number>restraint.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On March 15, 2006, [E] was removed from the care of [the respondent]. From April 19 to May 25, 2006, [the respondent] submitted to one urine screen out of eight.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-6\">\u201cAfter [E] was removed from [the respondent\u2019s] care on March 15, 2006, she and [the respondent] engaged in four supervised visits in the community. Two social workers and [E\u2019s] attorney were present for three out of the four visits. These visits were observed as being extremely detrimental to the well-being of [the] child. On June 8, 2006, the Juvenile Court in Hartford ceased visitation between [the] child and [the respondent] because the child was having significant adverse reaction to the visits. On June 9, 2006, it was reported to [the department by R, one of the mother\u2019s older children], that [the respondent and the mother] were living together and planning on getting married at the time of [the respondent\u2019s] reunification with [E]. [The respondent] was fully aware that any contact with [the mother] would jeopardize reunification efforts with [E] and yet he chose to withhold this information from [the department].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b870-7\">On June 23, 2006, the petitioner filed a petition for termination of parental rights as to both the respondent and the mother. The ground for the petition was the failure to achieve sufficient rehabilitation pursuant to \u00a7 17a-112 (j) (3) (B) (ii).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The court held a trial on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"845\">*845</page-number>November 13 and 17, 2006.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> At trial, the petitioner submitted five exhibits and six witnesses, and eight exhibits were submitted on behalf of E. The respondent submitted two exhibits and testified on his own behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-4\">In its January 31, 2007 memorandum of decision, the court found that the department had made reasonable efforts to reunify the petitioner and E, and that the respondent had failed to achieve a sufficient degree of personal rehabilitation pursuant to \u00a7 17a-112 Q) (3) (B). It further found that termination of the respondent\u2019s parental rights was in the best interest of E.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Accordingly, the court granted the petition and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b871-6\">Although not a model of precision, the respondent\u2019s first claim appears to be that because he \u201ccompleted all of the steps required,\u201d the court improperly considered his noncompliance with additional requirements mandated by the department. For two reasons, that claim is flawed.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-7\">First, the court never found that the respondent fully complied with the court-ordered specific steps. Rather, it made multiple findings to the contrary.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> For example, the court found that although he was required to submit to random drug testing conducted at the discretion of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"846\">*846</page-number>the department, the respondent failed to submit to several urine tests.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The court found that although the petitioner was required to participate in counseling and to make progress toward the identified treatment goal of improving his parenting skills, \u201che was either unable or unwilling to adjust his work schedule to accommodate an intake\u201d for multiple services initiated by the department, including those offered by the Family Development Center, Community Child Guidance Center, and New Hope and Planned Parenthood.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The court found that although he was required to visit E \u201cas often as the department permits,\u201d the respondent did not comply. Instead, \u201c[w]hen visits were increased from one hour to two hours on December 21, 2004, [he] cancelled the first two visits, and, thereafter, he did not adhere to the increased hours. He either arrived one hour late or left one hour early.\u201d The respondent also cancelled scheduled visits with E on May 11 and June 1, 2006. Although he was required to secure and to maintain adequate housing, the respondent refused to provide the department with a copy of his apartment lease to verify occupancy and refused to provide his landlord\u2019s telephone number to verify rent information. The respondent additionally was required to have no involvement with the criminal justice system. Nevertheless, on March 14, 2006, he was arrested on charges of disorderly conduct and unlawful restraint stemming from the domestic violence dispute with the mother in which \u201c [a]fter a night of drinking and domestic violence, [the respondent] was stabbed by the mother in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"847\">*847</page-number>presence of [E].\u201d See footnote 2. In light of the foregoing, the respondent\u2019s claim that he complied fully with all of the required steps is untenable.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-6\">Furthermore, to the extent that the petitioner contends that the court could not properly consider his noncompliance with additional requirements mandated by the department, his argument is contrary to Connecticut law. As this court observed in <em>In re Vincent D., </em>65 Conn. App. 658, 783 A.2d 534 (2001), \u201c[i]n determining whether a parent has achieved sufficient personal rehabilitation, a court may consider whether the parent has corrected the factors that led to the initial commitment, <em>regardless of whether those factors were included in specific expectations ordered by the court or imposed by the department.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Id., 670. In that case, the respondent mother \u201chad received explicit advice from the department, which she understood, that regaining custody of her child depended on her living apart from [the child\u2019s] father until he was drug free.\u201d Id. On appeal, this court held that the trial court properly considered the respondent mother\u2019s noncompliance with that requirement in finding that she had not achieved a sufficient degree of personal rehabilitation. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-7\">It is undisputed that the department repeatedly instructed the respondent that he was not to have any contact with the mother. The department further instructed the respondent not to allow E to have any contact with the mother. At trial, the respondent testified that he was aware of those restrictions and the fact that his failure to comply therewith could jeopardize his reunification with E. The court was free to consider the evidence of his noncompliance with those requirements in evaluating his rehabilitation. His claim, therefore, is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"848\">*848</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b874-6\">The respondent next claims that the court improperly found that the department made reasonable efforts to reunify him with E. We conclude that there was adequate evidence in the record to support the court\u2019s determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-7\">\u201cIn order to terminate parental rights under \u00a7 17a-112 (j), the department is required to prove, by clear and convincing evidence, that it has made reasonable efforts ... to reunify the child with the parent, unless the court finds . . . that the parent is unable or unwilling to benefit from reunification. . . . [Section 17a-112] imposes on the department the duty, inter alia, to make reasonable efforts to reunite the child or children with the parents. The word reasonable is the linchpin on which the department\u2019s efforts in a particular set of circumstances are to be adjudged, using the clear and convincing standard of proof. Neither the word reasonable nor the word efforts is, however, defined by our legislature or by the federal act from which the requirement was drawn. . . . [Reasonable efforts means doing everything reasonable, not everything possible. . . . The trial court\u2019s determination of this issue will not be overturned on appeal unless, in light of all of the evidence in the record, it is clearly erroneous.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>In re Samantha C., </em>268 Conn. 614, 632, 847 A.2d 883 (2004). \u201cA finding is clearly erroneous when either there is no evidence in the record to support it, or the reviewing court is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made. . . . On appeal, our function is to determine whether the trial court\u2019s conclusion was factually supported and legally correct. ... In doing so . . . [g]reat weight is given to the judgment of the trial court because of [the court\u2019s] opportunity to observe the parties and the evidence. . . . We do not examine the record to determine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"849\">*849</page-number>whether the trier of fact could have reached a conclusion other than the one reached. . . . [Rather] every reasonable presumption is made in favor of the trial court\u2019s ruling.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 627-28.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-6\">In its memorandum of decision, the court found that the department made reasonable efforts to reunify the respondent with E. The court detailed various efforts, including procuring services from the following providers: \u201cFamily Development Center, Community Child Guidance Center, New Hope and Planned Parenthood, the Vernon Family Center, Abundant Families, Preschool Intervention Program, psychological and interactional evaluations, ADRC and Genesis.\u201d That finding is supported by the department\u2019s social study for termination of parental rights that was offered into evidence at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-7\">In addition, the court had before it evidence that the department arranged supervised visits between the respondent and E that began in July, 2004, and continued for more than one year. When those visits proved unproductive, the department implemented additional services that provided even more time for the respondent to interact with E. The department also scheduled unsupervised overnight visits at the respondent\u2019s home. Furthermore, on February 8, 2006, while maintaining custody of E, the department reunited her with the respondent. The department arranged for day care on behalf of the respondent and agreed to pay half of that expense. The department also contacted Abundant Families, which provided the respondent with furniture for his apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-8\">When the petitioner removed E from the respondent\u2019s care one and one-half months later in the wake of the domestic violence dispute, the department continued <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"850\">*850</page-number>its attempt at reunification by arranging multiple supervised visits with E. The department did so despite consistent reports that the visits were detrimental to E\u2019s well-being and that no meaningful bond between E and the respondent existed. As the attorney for the minor child emphasized in her statement filed pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 67-13, \u201c[t]he department worked with [the respondent] for nineteen months, well beyond the suggested time frame spelled out in the Adoption and Safe Families Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 620 et seq. . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b876-6\">The respondent faults the department for failing to offer him \u201cany services regarding his position as the victim in a domestic violence situation.\u201d The record indicates, however, that the respondent was a perpetrator of domestic violence. The court specifically found that on March 14, 2006, the respondent \u201cdrank a pint of gin and several beers, then engaged [the mother] in a physical altercation. This altercation included [the respondent\u2019s] punching, pushing and screaming at [the mother and the mother\u2019s] stabbing [the respondent], all with [E] present.\u201d That finding is supported by the report filed by the Manchester police department following his arrest and introduced into evidence. By his actions, the respondent violated the department\u2019s instructions that he was not to have any contact with the mother and that he was to prohibit any contact between E and the mother. Notwithstanding that conduct, the department thereafter <em>continued </em>its efforts to reunify the respondent and E.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-7\">As we earlier noted, \u201c[reasonable efforts means doing everything reasonable, not everything possible.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>In re Samantha C., </em>supra, 268 Conn. 632. Examining the department\u2019s efforts in light of the particular circumstances of the present case, we conclude that there was adequate evidence from which the court could have concluded that the department made reasonable efforts to reunify the respondent with E. That determination is not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"851\">*851</page-number>Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b877-6\">The respondent contends that the court improperly found that he failed to achieve a sufficient degree of personal rehabilitation pursuant to \u00a7 17a-112 (j) (3) (B) (ii). We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-7\">\u201cOn appeal, we review a trial court\u2019s finding that a parent has failed to rehabilitate herself in accordance with the rules that apply generally to a trier\u2019s finding of fact. We will overturn such a finding of fact only if it is clearly erroneous in light of the evidence in the whole record. . . . We do not examine the record to determine whether the trier of fact could have reached a conclusion other than the one reached. . . . [0]n review by this court every reasonable presumption is made in favor of the trial court\u2019s ruling.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>In re Vincent D., </em>supra, 65 Conn. App. 669.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"853\">*853</page-number>Failure to achieve a sufficient degree of personal rehabilitation is one of the seven statutory grounds on which parental rights may be terminated under \u00a7 17a-112 (j) (3). Section \u00a7 17a-112 (j) permits a court to grant a petition to terminate parental rights \u201cif it finds by clear and convincing evidence that . . . the child . . . has been found by the Superior Court ... to have been neglected ... in a prior proceeding . . . and the parent of such child has been provided specific steps to take to facilitate the return of the child to the parent . . . and has failed to achieve such degree of personal rehabilitation as would encourage the belief that within a reasonable time, considering the age and needs of the child, such parent could assume a responsible position in the life of the child . . . .\u201d In making that determination, the proper focus is on the parent\u2019s demonstrable development in relation to the needs of the child. As we have observed: \u201c[I]n assessing rehabilitation, the critical issue is not whether the parent has improved [her] ability to manage [her] own life, but rather whether [she] has gained the ability to care for the particular needs of the child at issue.\u201d (Internal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"854\">*854</page-number>quotation marks omitted.) <em>In re Alejandro L., </em>91 Conn. App. 248, 260, 881 A.2d 450 (2005). Furthermore, our courts are required to construe liberally the provisions of \u00a7 17a-112 in the best interest of the child for whom a petition has been filed, rather than the parent thereof. See General Statutes \u00a7 17a-112 (q).</p>\n<p id=\"b880-6\">\u201c \u2018Rehabilitate\u2019 means \u2018to restore [a handicapped or delinquent person] to a useful and constructive place in society through social rehabilitation.\u2019 Webster, Third New International Dictionary.\u201d <em>In re Juvenile Appeal (84-3), </em>1 Conn. App. 463, 477, 473 A.2d 795, cert. denied, 193 Conn. 802, 474 A.2d 1259 (1984). Likewise, \u201c[failure to rehabilitate is defined as the failure of a parent to achieve expectations following the adjudication and disposition of the prior neglect petition.\u201d <em>In re Jessica M., </em>49 Conn. App. 229, 248, 714 A.2d 64 (1998), appeal dismissed, 250 Conn. 747, 738 A.2d 1087 (1999). Our review of the record reveals that the evidence credited by the court supports its conclusion that the respondent failed to attain a degree of rehabilitation sufficient to warrant the belief that at some time in the foreseeable future, he would be capable of assuming a responsible position with respect to the care of E.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-7\">The respondent\u2019s paternity was discovered months after the birth of E, her adjudication as a neglected child and her commitment to the custody of the petitioner. Both the respondent and the petitioner acknowledge that the term \u201creunification\u201d is something of a misnomer, as E has been in the care of the department since she was one month old. Upon confirmation of his paternity of E, the respondent told the department that \u201che could not care for her due to his work schedule but would speak to his family about caring for her.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"855\">*855</page-number>At that time, the respondent had abandoned two daughters in Ghana and had no relationship with E. He thereafter voluntarily entered into an agreement with the department to take certain steps to improve his ability to care for E. Indulging every presumption in favor of the court\u2019s ruling, as we must, the court reasonably could determine that in agreeing to comply with the specific steps in light of the aforementioned parenting history, the respondent sought to restore himself to the position of a capable parent. <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 46b-129 (j), the court provided the respondent with specific steps that included measures targeting the \u201cidentified treatment goals\u201d regarding his parenting abilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-6\">The record indicates that the respondent\u2019s efforts largely were unsuccessful. As previously noted, the respondent failed to comply fully with several of the specific steps ordered by the court. See part I. That determination finds support in the social study for termination of parental rights that was offered into evidence and the testimony adduced at trial. In addition, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"856\">*856</page-number>the respondent failed to comply with the department\u2019s instructions that he was not to have any contact with the mother and that he was not to allow E to have any contact with the mother. The respondent testified that he was aware of the mother\u2019s drug addiction and history with the department and the fact that failure to comply with the department\u2019s instructions could jeopardize his reunification with E. He nevertheless ignored those instructions. The court also had before it the statement of R, one of the mother\u2019s older children, that the respondent and the mother \u201cwere living together and planning to get married at the time of the respondent\u2019s reunification with E.\u201d Similarly, in the police report introduced into evidence, the mother referred to the respondent as \u201cher boyfriend\u201d and stated that she had her own key to the respondent\u2019s apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-6\">In addition, the respondent exposed E to domestic violence.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The police report indicated that on the evening of that dispute, E was removed from the apartment <em>after </em>the altercation between the respondent and the mother. Also, E\u2019s foster mother testified that in the days following the domestic violence dispute, E recounted how her \u201cdaddy was screaming\u201d because \u201che was bleeding.\u201d That testimony belies the respondent\u2019s statement that E was not present during the stabbing.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Further, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"857\">*857</page-number>it supports the court\u2019s finding that the respondent \u201cexhibited poor judgment in the upbringing of [E].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b883-6\">The court was presented with ample evidence documenting the respondent\u2019s inability to interact with E. As social worker Lourdes Gerena testified, during the supervised visits prior to the domestic violence dispute, E \u201cwould shut down. She didn\u2019t show any emotion; she wouldn\u2019t interact with the respondent. She wouldn\u2019t look at him or really even let him touch her hand or anything.\u201d Multiple social workers present at those supervised visits confirmed that E cried throughout the visits and was unresponsive to the respondent.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b884-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"858\">*858</page-number>Following the domestic violence dispute, the department arranged five supervised visits between the respondent and E. The respondent cancelled the visits scheduled on May 11, 2006, and June 1, 2006. During the visits that he attended, E exhibited a fear of the respondent. A social worker present at one of those visits stated that E \u201ctotally shut down and cried in the respondent\u2019s presence. She appeared frightened, uneasy, would not respond and would not interact with the respondent throughout the visit. E shook her head \u2018no\u2019 when asked if she wanted to have any more visits with the respondent.\u201d Another social worker described the visits to the court as \u201cthe saddest visits I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b884-6\">The court also was presented with evidence concerning the respondent\u2019s children in Ghana, whom it found he had abandoned in 2000 and \u201chas not seen them since. \u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> In assessing rehabilitation, the court is required <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"859\">*859</page-number>to obtain a historical perspective of the respondent\u2019s child caring and parenting abilities. <em>In re Daniel C., </em>63 Conn. App. 339, 354, 776 A.2d 487 (2001). The court heard detailed testimony from the respondent regarding his relationship with his daughters. As it stated in its memorandum of decision: \u201c[T]he court questioned [the respondent] at length with regard to his relationship with his two daughters who are living in Ghana with their maternal grandmother. [The respondent] left Ghana in 2000 when his daughter, [J], was two years old and is now eight years old and his daughter, [P], was four years old and is now ten years old. He has not seen these children in six years, talks to them occasionally on the telephone and from time to time sends small sums of money to them. While he has had an income since 2000 and has seemingly had no obligation to anyone other than himself until August 18,2004, when his paternity of [E] was determined, he has offered little, if any, support to those two children. He never attempted to bring his daughters to this country even for a visit nor saw fit to visit with them in Ghana.\u201d In light of that historical perspective, the court concluded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"860\">*860</page-number>that \u201c[i]t is remarkable to the court that [the respondent\u2019s] inattention to his two daughters in Ghana can be reconciled with a serious intention to father [E].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b886-6\">The court also heard the testimony of psychologist Kelly F. Rogers. \u201cCourts are entitled to give great weight to professionals in parental termination cases.\u201d <em>In re Christina V., </em>38 Conn. App. 214, 221, 660 A.2d 863 (1995); see also <em>In re Shyliesh H., </em>56 Conn. App. 167, 176, 743 A.2d 165 (1999) (\u201c[psychological testimony from professionals is appropriately accorded great weight in termination proceedings\u201d). Rogers evaluated the respondent and E in July, 2005, during which he conducted interactional studies of the child with the respondent, as well as with her foster parents. Rogers testified that although he originally recommended reunification of the respondent with E in August, 2005, he opposed it at the time of trial. Rogers based his opinion on a variety of factors that included (1) the respondent\u2019s lack of a relationship with E, (2) the respondent\u2019s ongoing relationship with the mother, (3) the domestic violence dispute, (4) the respondent\u2019s substance abuse that was documented in the police report, (5) E\u2019s strong bond with her foster family and the \u201crisk of trauma of another removal,\u201d (6) his concerns about E\u2019s long-term emotional and social development, and (7) his concerns about the respondent\u2019s credibility and \u201cability to correctly report to authorities on the status of his daughter.\u201d As a result, Rogers testified that he questioned the respondent\u2019s fitness as a parent.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-7\">In its summary of the adjudicatory findings, the court stressed the respondent\u2019s \u201cinability to parent E even after extensive participation in the services made available\u201d and his \u201cpoor judgment in the upbringing\u201d of E. It found that \u201c[t]he clear and convincing evidence indicates that [the respondent has] failed to improve [his] parenting ability to acceptable standards. . . . [D] espite [the department\u2019s] efforts on [his] behalf and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"861\">*861</page-number>[his] own efforts, [the respondent remains] incapable of providing a safe and nurturing environment for [his] child. When one considers the level of care, patience and discipline that children require from their caregivers, it is patently clear that [the respondent is] not in a better position to parent [E] now than [he was] at any other time during these proceedings, and that [he remains] without the qualities necessary to successfully parent [E].\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> It therefore found that considering E\u2019s age, needs and special needs, the respondent could not within a reasonable time assume a responsible position in the child\u2019s life.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-6\">It is well settled that the critical issue in assessing rehabilitation is whether the parent has gained the ability to care for the particular needs of the child at issue. <em>In re Halle T., </em>96 Conn. App. 815, 836, 902 A.2d 670 (2006); <em>In re Alejandro L., </em>supra, 91 Conn. App. 260; <em>In re Kristy A., </em>83 Conn.

The record amply supports the conclusion that the respondent has not gained that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"862\">*862</page-number>essential ability. Indulging every reasonable presumption in favor of the court\u2019s ruling, as our standard of review requires, we conclude that the evidence credited by the court supports its conclusion that the respondent failed to attain a degree of rehabilitation sufficient to warrant the belief that at some time in the foreseeable future, he would be capable of assuming a responsible position with respect to the care of E, as required by \u00a7 17a-112 Q) (3) (B) (\u00dc).</p>\n<p id=\"b888-4\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-5\">In this opinion BISHOP, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b866-14\"> The court also terminated the parental rights of E\u2019s mother, whom we refer to by that designation.

See, e.g., <em>In re Jeisean M., </em>270 Conn. 382, 397, 852 A.2d 643 (2004); <em>In re Samantha C., </em>supra, 268 Conn. 627; <em>In re Eden F., </em>250 Conn. 674, 705, 741 A.2d 873, reargument denied, 251 Conn. 924, 742 A.2d 364 (1999). \u201cAppellate review of a factual finding ... is limited both as a practical matter and as a matter of the fundamental difference between the role of the trial court and an appellate court.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Gorton </em>v. Gorton, 80 Conn. App. 52, 55, 832 A.2d 675 (2003). \u201cThe trial court\u2019s findings of fact are entitled to great deference and will be overturned only on a showing that they were clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Moreno-Cuevas, </em>104 Conn. App. 288, 291, 934 A.2d 260 (2007), cert. denied, 287 Conn. 901, 947 A.2d 344 (2008). \u201cUnder this deferential standard, [w]e do not examine the record to determine whether the trier of fact could have reached a conclusion other than the one reached.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Cadlerock Properties Joint Venture, L.P. </em>v. <em>Ashford, </em>98 Conn.

App. 777, 788, 946 A.2d 943 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b877-9\">Although the dissent concedes in a footnote that the clearly erroneous standard of review is the applicable standard by which an appellate court reviews a trial court\u2019s determination that a parent has failed to achieve rehabilitation, its analysis does not apply that deferential standard. In granting review to the respondent\u2019s unpreserved due process challenge to the court\u2019s determination that he failed to achieve a sufficient degree of personal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"852\">*852</page-number>rehabilitation, the dissent frames its analysis in terms of the respondent\u2019s \u201cliberty interest\u201d and, relying on Justice Thomas\u2019 concurring opinion in <em>Troxel v. Granville, 530 U.S. 57, </em>80, 120 S. Ct. 2054, 147 L. Ed. 2d <em>49 (2000), </em>strictly scrutinizes the record in a light most favorable to the respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"AkD\">Appellate review of the respondent\u2019s due process challenge is unwarranted and improper. At no time did the respondent distinctly allege a due process claim before the trial court. See Practice Book \u00a7 60-5 (court not bound to consider claim \u201cunless it was distinctly raised at the trial\u201d). Rather, during closing argument, counsel for the respondent generally alleged that \u201chis rights, as guaranteed by the fourteenth amendment to the United States constitution, have been violated.\u201d Indeed, the words \u201cdue process\u201d never were uttered at trial, nor were they discussed in any motion or memorandum of law submitted to the court. Under our rules of practice, \u201c[a]ny party intending to raise any question of law which may be the subject of an appeal must either state the question distinctly to the judicial authority in a written trial brief under Section 5-1 or state the question distinctly to the judicial authority on the record before such party\u2019s closing argument and within sufficient time to give the opposing counsel an opportunity to discuss the question. If the party fails to do this, the judicial authority will be under no obligation to decide the question.\u201d Practice Book \u00a7 5-2; see also <em>Weinstein v. Weinstein, </em>275 Conn. 671, 743, 882 A.2d 53 (2005). The respondent failed to comply with that rule of practice.</p>\n<p id=\"Af8\">Most importantly, the trial court did not address the respondent\u2019s alleged due process claim in its memorandum of decision. The respondent thereafter did not seek an articulation of that decision. See Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 66-5 and 61-10. \u201cWe have repeatedly held that this court will not consider claimed errors on the part of the trial court unless it appears on the record that the question was distinctly raised at trial <em>and was ruled upon and decided by the court </em>adversely to the appellant\u2019s claim.\u201d (Emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>McGuire </em>v. <em>McGuire, </em>102 Conn.

See Practice Book \u00a7 60-5. \u201cConnecticut law is clear that a party seeking review of unpreserved claims under either the plain error doctrine; Practice Book \u00a7 60-5; or <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>[supra, 239-40], must affirmatively request such review.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Wheatland, </em>93 Conn.

Nevertheless, despite his puzzlement, the respondent failed to seek an articulation of the trial court\u2019s decision in the present case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b882-7\"> We disagree with the dissent\u2019s factual finding attributing to the respondent a \u201cclean record.\u201d First and foremost, \u201cthis court does not find facts.\u201d <em>Branford </em>v. <em>Van Eck, </em>86 Conn.

Second, the trial court found that prior to the birth of E, the respondent abandoned two minor children in Ghana, a finding the respondent does not contest on appeal. The court further found that months before the termination petition was filed, the respondent was arrested on charges of disorderly conduct and unlawful restraint stemming from the domestic violence dispute and that he engaged in substance abuse at that time. See footnote 2.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b882-8\"> In its memorandum of decision, the court indicated that it did not find the respondent\u2019s testimony credible. It stated: \u201cThe court questioned [the respondent] extensively during the trial and is mindful of the examination by others. At that time and also prevailing throughout the court\u2019s viewing of the evidence, the court has observed a reluctance of [the respondent] to respond in a forthright, positive manner. Rather, he responded in most <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"857\">*857</page-number>instances reluctantly with an inordinate amount of hesitation, pausing to seemingly prepare a response that he felt would curry favor in the particular situation but not necessarily truly factual. This was the distinct impression of the court, and this character of [the respondent] to somewhat fabricate, explains the impression this man had given to [department] workers and supervisors, counsel for the department and others to lead them down a path for proposing reunification for a long period. He put on a good facade for all, but beyond the front there was lacking a firm resolve to accomplish the satisfactory completion of the services in order to be able to serve as a safe, responsible and nurturing parent within a reasonable time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b883-8\">We note that the police report indicates that on the evening of the domestic violence dispute, the respondent averred that the dispute was with \u201chis girlfriend,\u201d who he claimed attacked him in his apartment. The respondent further stated that the mother was \u201cnot at his home when this argument happened.\u201d At trial, the respondent acknowledged that his statements were not truthful.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b883-9\"> We agree with the dissent\u2019s observation that the evidence in the record suggests the lack of an ongoing parent-child relationship. Although we agree that \u201cpunctilious adherence to procedural guidelines\u201d is required in termination proceedings; <em>In re Vincent D., </em>supra, 65 Conn. App. 668; we are also mindful that \u201cwhether to terminate parental rights is a highly fact-specific process.\u201d <em>In re Shane P., </em>58 Conn. App. 244, 254, 754 A.2d 169 (2000). In the present case, our analysis is predicated on a multitude of factors, including (1) the respondent\u2019s abandonment of his two minor children in Ghana; (2) the fact that upon confirmation of his paternity of E, the respondent told the department that \u201che could not care for her due to his work schedule\u201d; (3) the respondent\u2019s failure to comply fully with several of the specific steps ordered by the court; (4) the respondent\u2019s failure to comply with the department\u2019s instructions that he was not to have any contact with the mother and that he was not to allow E to have any contact with the mother; (5) the fact that the respondent and the mother were planning to get married <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"858\">*858</page-number>at the time of the respondent\u2019s reunification with E; (6) the fact that the respondent exposed E to domestic violence; (7) the respondent\u2019s inability to interact with E; and (8) the testimony of psychologist Kelly F. Rogers, who opined that he questioned the respondent\u2019s fitness as a parent. Considering those factors under the applicable standard or review, which requires this court to make every reasonable presumption in favor of the trial court\u2019s ruling; <em>In re Vincent D., </em>supra, 669; we cannot say that it was clearly erroneous for the court to conclude that the respondent had failed to attain a degree of rehabilitation sufficient to warrant the belief that at some time in the foreseeable future, he would be capable of assuming a responsible position with respect to the care of E.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b884-8\"> The respondent has not disputed that factual finding on appeal and made no mention of his Ghanaian children in either his appellate brief or at oral argument before this court. In questioning, sua sponte, that finding in footnote 6 of its opinion, the dissent fails to accord appropriate deference to the trial court as \u201cthe appropriate forum for the resolution of factual disputes\u201d; <em>First National Bank of Litchfield </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>285 Conn. 294, 302, 939 A.2d 572 (2008); in derogation of the \u201cwell established [principle] that [appellate] review is limited to claims raised by the parties in their briefs.\u201d <em>Payton </em>v. <em>Payton, </em>103 Conn.

It is a most serious and sensitive judicial action. <em>Anonymous </em>v. <em>Norton, </em>168 Conn. 421, 430, 362 A.2d 532, cert. denied, 423 U.S. 935, 96 S. Ct. 294, 46 L. Ed. 2d 268 (1975).

We have long recognized that the Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause, like its Fifth Amendment counterpart, guarantees more than fair process. . . .

Thus, any statute which interferes with the parent\u2019s right to raise a child free from interference of the state as well as any procedure implementing it will be subject to strict scrutiny.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Id., 80 (Thomas, J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b889-6\">I agree with the trial court and the majority that the department of children and families (department) made reasonable efforts to reunify the minor child, E, with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"864\">*864</page-number>the respondent father and that he was unwilling or unable to benefit from such efforts, and I agree that a termination of the respondent\u2019s parental rights is in the child\u2019s best interest. I regrettably cannot agree, however, with the conclusion that the respondent\u2019s parental rights appropriately were terminated on the stated statutory ground of failure to achieve personal rehabilitation.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> If the state is going to intervene and terminate an individual\u2019s parental rights, it is paramount that the state allege and prove the appropriate statutory ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-6\">\u201cCompliance with the statutory criteria for termination cannot be dismissed by an all-encompassing best interests standard. <em>In re Juvenile Appeal (Anonymous), </em>177 Conn. 648, 672, 420 A.2d 875 (1979). Insistence upon strict compliance with the statutory criteria before termination of parental rights and subsequent adoption proceedings can occur is not inconsistent with concern for the best interests of the child. Rather, it enhances the child\u2019s best interests by promoting autonomous families and by reducing the dangers of arbitrary and biased decisions amounting to state intrusion disguised under the rubric of the child\u2019s best interests. Id. <em>[T]he risk that judges or social workers will be tempted, consciously or unconsciously, to compare unfavorably the material advantages of the child\u2019s natural parents with those of prospective adoptive parents and therefore to reach a result based on such comparisons rather than on the statutory criteria requires the court, in considering a petition to terminate parental rights, to sever completely the issue of whether termination is statutorily warranted and whether a proposed adoption is desirable </em>. . . .\u201d (Citation omitted; emphasis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"865\">*865</page-number>added; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>In re Juvenile Appeal, </em>1 Conn. App. 463, 467, 473 A.2d 795, cert. denied, 193 Conn. 802, 474 A.2d 1259 (1984). While it may have been in the best interest of E that the court terminated the respondent\u2019s parental rights, it is in the best interest of the public that the petitioner, the commissioner of children and families, select the appropriate statutory ground. Here, the court applied an improper statutoiy ground, which was alleged by the petitioner, in order to do what was in the best interest of E.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-6\">The respondent argues that the termination of his parental rights on the sole basis that he failed to achieve a sufficient degree of personal rehabilitation as would encourage a belief that within a reasonable time, considering the age and needs of the child, he could assume a responsible position in the life of the child, denied him due process.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> That claim is supported by the follow<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"866\">*866</page-number>ing facts in the record. At the time the respondent was identified as E\u2019s father, he had a clean record. He had no history of substance abuse, no criminal history, no history of domestic violence, no history with the department, and he was gainfully employed and had housing during most of the time in question. In fact, E\u2019s social worker testified that the respondent had a \u201cclean record\u201d and that she did not make referrals for a sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"867\">*867</page-number>stance abuse evaluation previous to returning E to him because she was not concerned about substance abuse.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b893-6\">The petitioner sought to terminate the respondent\u2019s parental rights on the basis of a failure to achieve a sufficient degree of rehabilitation pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 17a-112 (j) (3) (B) (ii). \u201cRehabilitate\u201d means to restore a handicapped or delinquent person to a useful and constructive place in society through social rehabilitation. <em>In re Heather L., </em>49 Conn. Sup. 287, 308, 877 A.2d 27 (2004), aff'd, 274 Conn. 174, 874 A.2d 796 (2005). Webster\u2019s defines \u201crehabilitate\u201d as \u201cto restore to a former capacity ... to restore to good repute . . . .\u201d Merriam-Webster\u2019s Collegiate Dictionary (10th Ed. 1993). Numerous Connecticut decisions have used the language that \u201c[p]ersonal rehabilitation as used in the statute refers to the restoration of a parent to his or her former constructive and useful role as a parent.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>In re Alejandro L., </em>91 Conn. App. 248, 259, 881 A.2d 450 (2005).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Moreover, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"868\">*868</page-number>courts in other states have determined that rehabilitation is \u201cremov[ing] the circumstances, conditions, or conduct that caused the parent\u2019s inability or unwillingness to properly care for the child.\u201d <em>M.E. </em>v. <em>Shelby County Dept. of Human Resources, </em>972 So. 2d 89, 102 (Ala. Civ. App. 2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b894-6\">Whatever definition is used, all have in common the concept of restoration from something. Here, the respondent poses the question: from what was he to be rehabilitated? The record in this case does not support the fact that the respondent suffered from some condition or disability from which he needed to be restored or rehabilitated. Admittedly, he had limited parenting skills, but this is not a condition from which he had to be rehabilitated. In order to prove a failure to achieve rehabilitation as a ground for termination of parental rights, a two-pronged test for rehabilitation must be satisfied: The state must prove by clear and convincing evidence that the parent has failed to achieve rehabilitation and that there is no reason to believe that a parent could assume a responsible position in the life of a child within a reasonable time, considering the child\u2019s age and needs. See General Statutes \u00a7 17a-112 (j) (3) (B); <em>In re Danuael D., </em>51 Conn. App. 829, 843, 724 A.2d 546 (1999); see generally <em>In re Migdalia M., </em>6 Conn.

The majority\u2019s use of this language changes the meaning of the termination ground from \u201cfailure to rehabilitate\u201d to \u201c[gaining] the ability to care for the particular needs of the child at issue.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-6\">The actual petition for termination of parental rights is a preprinted form on which the jurisdictional facts and grounds are set forth with a number of boxes to be checked when applicable. In the space reserved for grounds of termination, the form has the seven grounds set forth in \u00a7 17a-112 (j). For each of the seven subcategories there is box. The only box checked in this case was that next to the language for ground (B), the so-called failure to rehabilitate ground. No other box was checked. Evidence in the record may have supported several other grounds, such as ground (D), which is that there is no ongoing parent-child relationship. The procedure to prepare a termination of parental rights petition is simple, but the parent-child relationship is so important that great care and attention should be taken to ensure that viable grounds of termination, if they exist, are alleged. Unfortunately, the effort was not made to match the facts and evidence of this case to the statutory grounds, nor was any motion ever made to amend the petition to allege viable grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-7\">\u201cPleadings are intended to limit the issues to be decided at the trial of a case and [are] calculated to prevent surprise. . . . [The] purpose of pleadings is to frame, present, define, and narrow the issues and to form the foundation of, and to limit, the proof to be submitted at trial . . . .\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Birchard </em>v. <em>New Britain, </em>103 Conn. App. 79, 83, 927 A.2d 985, cert. denied, 284 Conn. 920, 933 A.2d 721 (2007). Practice Book \u00a7 33a-l (a), concerning the initiation of judicial proceedings for the termination of parental rights, provides in relevant part: \u201cThe petitioner shall set forth with reasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"871\">*871</page-number>particularity, <em>including statutory references, </em>the specific conditions which have resulted in the situation which is the subject of the petition. \u201d (Emphasis added.) The facts adduced at this trial do not support, in my opinion, a finding by clear and convincing evidence that the respondent has failed to rehabilitate. A reasonable person in the respondent\u2019s position when presented with this petition would not have the belief that he would have his relationship with his child completely severed. In this case, it is not the finding of facts that is clearly erroneous but the application of the law. The improper statutory ground was alleged.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-6\">The department checked the wrong box.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-7\">I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b889-7\"> Generally, when a statutory classification affects a fundamental liberty interest, that statute is subject to strict scrutiny. See <em>Keogh </em>v. <em>Bridgeport, </em>187 Conn. 53, 66, 444 A.2d 225 (1982). In the present case, the parties do not assert, nor do I, that the statute in this case should be examined or challenged. I simply emphasize the fundamental nature and importance of a parent\u2019s right to raise his or her children, which, because of the statutory scheme, must be properly applied. I agree with the majority that in the present case, the court\u2019s decision is governed by the clearly erroneous standard of review. I am of the opinion, however, that a mistake was committed. See <em>Shapero </em>v. <em>Mercede, </em>66 Conn. App. 343, 346-47, 784 A.2d 435 (2001) (\u201cA finding of fact is clearly erroneous when there is no evidence in the record to support it ... or when although there is evidence to support it, the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed. ...

Here, the evidence does not support a finding of failure to rehabilitate.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b890-7\"> A reversal of the judgment here would not automatically reunify E with the respondent; rather, she would remain committed to the custody of the petitioner until the petitioner petitioned the court for termination of the respondent\u2019s parental rights on the proper statutory ground or made an appropriate permanency plan.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b891-7\"> The respondent\u2019s first issue on appeal was that \u201c[t]he trial court erred in finding that the respondent father had failed to rehabilitate. . . . The respondent father was not accorded his due process rights as provided by the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment to the United States Constitution.\u201d The respondent further enunciated his due process argument in his brief before this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-8\">Although the majority has determined that the respondent\u2019s due process claim is not preserved, I believe that the claim is preserved and should be addressed due to the fundamental right involved in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-9\">Practice Book \u00a7 5-2 provides: \u201cAny party intending to raise any question of law which may be the subject of an appeal must either state the question distinctly to the judicial authority in a written trial brief under Section 5-1 or state the question distinctly to the judicial authority on the record before such party\u2019s closing argument and within sufficient time to give the opposing counsel an opportunity to discuss the question. If the party fails to do this, the judicial authority will be under no obligation to decide the question.\u201d The respondent satisfied Practice Book \u00a7 5-2.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-10\">In his closing argument at trial, the respondent asserted \u201chis position that his rights, as guaranteed by the fourteenth amendment to the United States constitution, have been violated.\u201d He made this argument by stating that the department conducted a background check, in which it found that he did not have a criminal history and did not have a history with the department.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-11\">The following language excerpted from the respondent\u2019s closing argument expands on his due process claim: \u201c[A] police report of a single incident of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"866\">*866</page-number>domestic violence. That is not a failure to rehabilitate. Rehabilitate means to restore to a prior level. [The respondent] doesn\u2019t have any history of domestic violence. . . . [The department social worker] said there was no concern about substance abuse. She never made a referral for an evaluation in the two years that they were working on sending [E] home. No evidence of alcohol abuse at all. ... In any event, he submitted to the substance abuse [testing], and it was negative. Both urine screens and the hair test were negative. So, he\u2019s not rehabilitating from substance abuse. . . . <em>This is a violation of our laws. </em>There\u2019s one ground for termination, and that\u2019s failure to rehabilitate. When asked from what [the respondent] was rehabilitating, [another social worker from the department] had trouble identifying it. I believe she said, well, ah\u2014I guess severe domestic violence or maybe substance abuse. But it can\u2019t be either one of those.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"AZi\">Furthermore, Practice Book \u00a7 60-5 provides in relevant part: \u201cThe court shall not be bound to consider a claim unless it was distinctly raised at the trial or arose subsequent to the trial. The court may in the interests of justice notice plain error not brought to the attention of the trial court. . . .\u201d The predecessor to Practice Book \u00a7 60-5, before it was amended in 1979, provided: \u201cThe supreme court shall not be bound to consider any errors on an appeal unless they are specifically assigned or claimed and unless it appears on the record that the question was distinctly raised at the trial <em>and was ruled upon and decided by the court </em>adversely to the appellant\u2019s claim, or that it arose subsequent to the trial.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Therefore, even though the majority claims that unless the issue is distinctly raised and <em>decided </em>by the court, it is not preserved and review is precluded absent review under <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 239-40, 567 A.2d 823 (1989), or plain error review, I believe it was sufficiently raised. Furthermore, Practice Book \u00a7 60-5 does not preclude a claim that was raised imperfectly from being reviewed; it merely states that the court is not bound to afford it review.</p>\n<p id=\"A_6\">Moreover, the petitioner did not object to the respondent\u2019s due process argument by claiming that it was not preserved; rather, the petitioner asserted only that the claim was briefed inadequately. The respondent\u2019s due process claim, however, is ten pages long, and the respondent has analyzed his claim and provided case law in support of such claim. See generally <em>State </em>v. <em>Linarte, </em>107 Conn.

In its opinion, however, the majority appears to conclude that the respondent\u2019s failure to rehabilitate was supported by the court\u2019s finding that he had abandoned his two daughters in Ghana when he first came to the United States and his involvement in a domestic violence incident in which he had been stabbed. The respondent testified that he was trying to work with immigration authorities to bring his daughters to the United States. He also informed the court that he spoke with his daughters on a regular basis. While the court found it \u201cremarkable\u201d that the respondent had been so inattentive to his daughters in Ghana, the facts and circumstances surrounding his departure from Ghana, leaving his daughters behind, are unclear. Moreover, neither the petitioner nor the court claimed that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"869\">*869</page-number>respondent, in order to reunify with E, should have taken measures to bring his other daughters to the United States. I am not attacking the finding of the court that the respondent abandoned his daughters in Ghana. I raise this issue because the record does not provide us with enough information about the circumstances of the respondent and his family in Ghana for us to determine whether leaving his children in another country, more than six years earlier, is relevant to his ability to raise E.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b895-12\"> <em>In re Alejandro L. </em>is but one example of a litany of cases in which the facts clearly demonstrate the conditions from which the parent failed to rehabilitate.

For example, the respondent was admitted to Manchester Memorial Hospital for attempted suicide and was admitted to River East, the intensive outpatient treatment program at Natchaug Hospital, but was discharged for not attending her therapy sessions.

She was arrested for burglary and was admitted to River East again but was subsequently discharged for failure to comply with recommended treatment for cocaine addiction. Id., 253. She also refused to attend recommended intensive treatment at the Teamworks partial hospitalization program, saying instead that she intended to enroll in a New Direction program but failed to enroll. Id. She was then referred for the third time to another intake appointment at Hockanum Valley and, for the third time, was discharged for failure to comply with the program. Id. The department, referred her to Stafford Family Services for counseling and provided transportation, but she failed to attend. Id., 254.
