Godialis, </em>senior assistant state\u2019s attorney, with whom, on the brief, was <em>Michael Dearington, </em>state\u2019s attorney, for the appellee (state).</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b512-12\">\n<em>Opinion</em>\n</p>\n<author id=\"b512-13\">PER CURIAM.</author>\n<p id=\"AS4\">The defendant, Scott Lewis, appeals from the judgment of the trial court dismissing his motion to correct an illegal disposition. The defendant claims that, in determining that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction, the court improperly construed Practice Book \u00a7 43-22. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-14\">The defendant was convicted, in 1995, of two counts of murder in violation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-8 and 53a-54a, and two counts of felony murder in violation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54c.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Our Supreme Court affirmed the defendant\u2019s conviction following his direct appeal. See <em>State </em>v. Lewis, 245 Conn. 779, 717 A.2d 1140 (1998).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">The defendant thereafter filed a motion to correct an illegal disposition pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 43-22, claiming that our Supreme Court, in affirming his conviction, had \u201crelied upon . . . false and wilfully excluded facts ... in rendering its decision.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The state filed a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, claiming that a motion to correct pursuant to \u00a7 43-22 \u201cis an inappropriate vehicle for challenging a sentence based on some alleged defect in the conviction.\u201d The court granted the motion to dismiss, reasoning that \u201c[t]he defendant\u2019s motion does not . . . address the sentence or disposition of his case. His only attack is on the validity of the underlying conviction.\u201d This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-7\">The plaintiff claims that the court, in granting the state\u2019s motion to dismiss, overlooked the import of his motion to correct. He argues that the court improperly assumed that he had filed a motion to correct an illegal <em>sentence </em>pursuant to \u00a7 43-22, whereas he had actually filed a motion to correct an illegal <em>disposition. </em>The defendant indicates that \u00a7 43-22 clearly provides in relevant part that \u201c[t]he judicial authority may at any time correct an illegal sentence <em>or other illegal disposition </em>. . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) He contends that the claim asserted by his motion to correct, which was that there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>existed a fault in the appeals process, is encompassed within the phrase \u201cother illegal disposition.\u201d We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">Before we address the merits of the defendant\u2019s claim, we must first discuss the principles of subject matter jurisdiction that guide our resolution of his claim. \u201cIn the absence of statutory or constitutional provisions, the limits of [the trial court\u2019s] jurisdiction are delineated by the common law.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Luzietti, </em>230 Conn. 427, 431, 646 A.2d 85 (1994). Although \u201cthe [trial] court loses jurisdiction over the case when [a] defendant is committed to the custody of the commissioner of correction and begins serving [his] sentence\u201d; id., 432; \u00a7 43-22 embodies a common-law exception that permits the trial court to correct an illegal sentence or other illegal disposition. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Lawrence, </em>281 Conn. 147, 155, 913 A.2d 428 (2007). Thus, if the defendant cannot demonstrate that his motion to correct falls within the purview of \u00a7 43-22, the court lacks jurisdiction to entertain it. Furthermore, \u201c[o]ur standard of review governing an appeal from a judgment granting a motion to dismiss on the ground of lack of subject matter jurisdiction concerns a question of law and is plenary.\u201d <em>Mercer </em>v. <em>Rodriquez, </em>83 Conn. App. 251, 255, 849 A.2d 886 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b514-7\">It is well settled that \u201c[t]he propose of ... \u00a7 43-22 is not to attack the validity of a conviction by setting it aside but, rather to correct an illegal sentence or disposition . . . .\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Mollo, </em>63 Conn. App. 487, 491, 776 A.2d 1176, cert. denied, 257 Conn. 904, 777 A.2d 194 (2001); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Lawrence, </em>supra, 281 Conn. 158. Therefore, \u201cthe relief allowed by ... \u00a7 43-22 . . . requirefs], as a precondition, a valid conviction.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Mollo, </em>supra, 491. It is clear to us that the defendant\u2019s motion to correct, regardless of whether framed as a motion to correct an illegal sentence or a motion to correct an illegal disposition, solely challenges his conviction rather than the sentence or disposition of that conviction. His claim that our Supreme <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>Court relied on a faulty factual basis in rejecting an evidentiary challenge and, thus, affirming his conviction, amounts to a direct attack on the validity of his conviction.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Accordingly, the trial court was correct to conclude that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction to review the defendant\u2019s claim pursuant to \u00a7 43-22.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b513-8\"> The defendant subsequently was sentenced to a term of incarceration of 120 years.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b513-9\"> Because the defendant had been convicted of both murder and felony murder with respect to each of two victims, the Supreme Court directed the merger of the felony murder convictions with the murder convictions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b513-10\"> Specifically, the defendant claimed that, due to an incorrect transcript having been filed with our Supreme Court, that court, at the time it considered the direct appeal, was under the improper belief that a third party, whose hearsay statements the defendant had sought to introduce at trial, had not been proven to have been unavailable at trial and that the state knowingly declined to draw the court\u2019s attention to this error.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b515-12\"> We note that our decision today does not preclude the defendant from pursuing his claim via other remedies available at law, including a petition for a writ of habeas coipus. See, e.g., <em>Flaherty </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>155 Conn. 36, 39, 229 A.2d 362 (1967) (\u201c[w]here a person is confined pursuant to a judgment, the validity of his detention under that judgment is the proper issue to be determined [in a writ of habeas corpus]\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
