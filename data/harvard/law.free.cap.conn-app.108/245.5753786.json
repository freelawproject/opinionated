On appeal, the petitioner claims that the habeas court improperly denied his two post-judgment motions without conducting a hearing to inquire into the merits of his claims. We affirm the judgment of the habeas court.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-13\">The following factual and procedural history is relevant to our disposition of the petitioner\u2019s appeal. On May 13, 1999, pursuant to a plea agreement, and after being properly canvassed, the petitioner pleaded guilty pursuant to <em>North Carolina </em>v. <em>Alford, </em>400 U.S. 25, 91 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>S. Ct. 160, 27 L. Ed. 2d 162 (1970),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to manslaughter in the first degree with a firearm in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-55a and conspiracy to tamper with a witness in violation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-151 and 53a-48. On August 12, 1999, the trial court sentenced the petitioner to thirty years imprisonment. On June 22, 2000, the petitioner filed a pro se petition for a writ of habeas corpus. Subsequently, on September 10, 2002, the petitioner\u2019s habeas counsel filed an amended petition for a writ of habeas corpus. The petition alleged three claims of ineffective assistance of trial counsel. The petitioner alleged that trial counsel failed (1) to pursue discovery and to communicate with him concerning it, (2) to challenge the petitioner\u2019s arrest and the search of the area in which he was arrested, as well as the arrest warrant itself, and (3) to communicate with him regarding legal standards and evidentiary standards so that the petitioner could make a knowing and voluntary decision as to whether to proceed to trial or plead guilty. On February 20, 2003, the habeas court issued a memorandum of decision denying the amended habeas petition. The petitioner\u2019s habeas counsel failed to file a timely petition for certification to appeal from the court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">On February 26, 2003, the petitioner filed a pro se petition for certification to appeal from the court\u2019s decision, and the court denied that petition on February 28, 2003. Next, on June 12, 2003, the petitioner filed a pro se letter with the court, which the court construed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>as a motion for reconsideration of its judgment. Additionally, on July 14, 2003, the petitioner filed a pro se motion for rehearing of the court\u2019s denial of his amended habeas petition. On July 18, 2003, the court denied both without a hearing. On September 29, 2003, the petitioner filed with this court a motion for permission to file a late appeal, which this court denied on November 6, 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">On July 18, 2006, the petitioner\u2019s current counsel filed a second petition for a writ of habeas corpus, alleging ineffective assistance of both trial counsel and prior habeas counsel. Also, on July 18, 2006, the petitioner and the habeas trial prosecutor entered into an agreement to restore the petitioner\u2019s appellate rights in the first habeas action.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The court rendered a stipulated judgment pursuant to the agreement. As a result, the petitioner filed a second petition for certification to appeal from the judgment in the first habeas action.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On August 24, 2006, the court granted this second petition for certification to appeal from the judgment, and this appeal followed on September 8,2006. The petitioner\u2019s attorney filed an appeal form on which he stated that the petitioner was appealing from the denial of the petition for a writ of habeas corpus.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-7\">After oral arguments, this court ordered the parties, on March 28, 2008, to submit supplemental briefs on the issue of \u201cwhether the claim that the habeas court denied the petitioner\u2019s postjudgment motions without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>a hearing is properly before this court, as it appears to fall outside the scope of the stipulated judgment to which the petitioner agreed.\u201d The respondent, the commissioner of correction, argued that the denial of the two postjudgment motions was outside the scope of the stipulated judgment and therefore not properly before the court. In contrast, the petitioner argued that the issue of the denial of the two postjudgment motions properly was before this court because it was the intention of the parties to the stipulation to include any issues on appeal that could have been raised as of the time of entry of the stipulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-4\">The petitioner\u2019s only claim in this appeal is that the habeas court improperly denied his two postjudgment motions without conducting a hearing to inquire into the merits of his claims. We decline to review this claim, as it falls outside the scope of the stipulated judgment to which the petitioner agreed. Indeed, the stipulated judgment provided that the petitioner\u2019s rights were restored with respect to his right to petition the court for certification <em>to appeal from the habeas court\u2019s denial of his amended petition for a writ of habeas corpus. </em>The pro se motions for reconsideration and for a rehearing were filed three and one-half months and four and one-half months, respectively, after the court rendered judgment denying the petitioner\u2019s amended petition for a writ of habeas corpus. Therefore, the pro se, postjudgment motions were not raised in the petitioner\u2019s amended petition for a writ of habeas corpus.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> As such, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>the challenge to the denial of those motions does not fall within the scope of the rights restored to the petitioner in the stipulated judgment, and, consequently, we decline to review the petitioner\u2019s claim.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b273-7\"> \u201cUnder <em>North Carolina </em>v. <em>Alford, </em>[supra], 400 U.S. 25 ... a criminal defendant is not required to admit Ms guilt . . . but consents to being punished as if he were guilty to avoid the risk of proceeding to trial. . . . A guilty plea under the <em>Alford </em>doctrine is a judicial oxymoron in that the defendant does not admit guilt but acknowledges that the state\u2019s evidence against him is so strong that he is prepared to accept the entry of a guilty plea nevertheless.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Fowlkes, </em>283 Conn. 735, 736 n.1, 930 A.2d 644 (2007).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b274-8\"> The agreement stated: \u201cIT IS FURTHER STIPULATED AND AGREED that [the petitioner\u2019s] right [to] petition the [habeas] court for certification to appeal the [dismissal [of his first amended petition for a writ of habeas corpus] be and hereby is restored to him . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b274-9\"> At the time the parties entered into the stipulated judgment, it appears that they were under the assumption that a timely petition for certification to appeal had not been filed after the court denied the petitioner\u2019s first habeas petition.
