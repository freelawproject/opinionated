Martin, Jr., alleged that the defendant discriminated against him in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 Sl^OOa.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Specifically, the plaintiff alleges that the defendant improperly terminated his employment after he was injured during the course of his employment and filed a workers\u2019 compensation claim and that the defendant\u2019s agents or employees intentionally and negligently inflicted emotional distress on him. On appeal, the plaintiff claims that in granting the motion for summary judgment, the court improperly (1) weighed the evidence as to his allegations under \u00a7 31-290a, rather than limiting its decision to whether there were genuine issues of material fact, and (2) determined that governmental immunity barred his emotional distress claims. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-8\">The plaintiff commenced his three count action in December, 2004. In count one, the plaintiff alleged that the defendant, through its agents and employees, violated \u00a7 31-290a by discriminating against him on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>basis of his work-related injury. In count two, the plaintiff alleged that the defendant, through its agents and employees, discriminated against him because he filed a claim for workers\u2019 compensation benefits pursuant to \u00a7 31-290a.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In count three, the plaintiff alleged that the conduct of the defendant\u2019s agents and employees was extreme and outrageous and resulted in negligent and intentional infliction of emotional distress. In response, the defendant alleged several special defenses as to each count.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-4\">The plaintiffs claims are predicated on the following facts as alleged in his complaint. The defendant employed the plaintiff as a mechanic in 1984 and later, for fourteen years, as a master mechanic. The plaintiff was the only African-American male employed by the defendant as a master mechanic in the defendant\u2019s department of public works. The complaint also alleged that the defendant is a municipal corporation that regularly employs more than fifteen, persons. At all times relevant, Stephen J. Edwards was the director of public works.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-5\">On March 18, 2002, the plaintiff injured his back in the course of his employment and sought treatment for his injury. The plaintiffs treating physicians, Anthony LaMarca and Nicholas Polifroni, orthopedic surgeons, placed the. plaintiff on light duty from 2003 until August, 2004. On April 8, 2003, Polifroni opined that the plaintiff had a 5 percent permanent partial disability of his back <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>and that he had reached maximum medical improvement. The complaint further alleged that the defendant began to mistreat him and place certain conditions on him on the basis of his March 18, 2002 work-related injury. The plaintiff returned to work several times, and the defendant sent him home, despite the plaintiffs having obtained a physician\u2019s permission to work. Edwards refused to let the plaintiff perform light duty assignments as permitted by his treating physician.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-5\">The plaintiff also alleged that on April 8, 2003, he was able to return to his employment without any restrictions. He alleged that due to his disability or work-related injury, the defendant deprived him of certain privileges that were available to his colleagues, such as permitting him to work with his disability or work-related injury. The plaintiff alleged that he complained about the discriminatory practices of his colleagues but that the defendant did nothing to remedy the situation and violated the duty it owed the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-6\">On August 10,2004, the defendant informed the plaintiff that it had awarded him a disability pension, as the result of his March 18, 2002 back injury, effective September 1,2004. According to the plaintiff, the defendant\u2019s actions against him were extreme and outrageous and created an unreasonable risk of causing him emotional distress. Moreover, the plaintiff alleged that the defendant intended, knew or recklessly disregarded the fact that its extreme and outrageous conduct caused the plaintiff to suffer mental, physical and emotional harm, as well as injury to his self-esteem and sense of self-worth.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-7\">The plaintiff alleged that as a direct and proximate result of the defendant\u2019s acts and those of its agents and employees, he suffered injury to his physical health, good reputation, humiliation, anguish, embarrassment, mortification, outrage, lost wages and work benefits, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>such as vacation, sick and personal time, salary increases and pension benefits. The plaintiff alleged that the defendant\u2019s acts were oppressive and malicious, entitling him to an award of punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-4\">In March, 2006, the defendant filed a motion for summary judgment. In its motion, the defendant claimed that there were no genuine issues of material fact and that it was entitled to summary judgment on the grounds that (1) there was no causal connection between the plaintiffs exercising his right to workers\u2019 compensation benefits and his receiving a disability pension, (2) the defendant was entitled to governmental immunity for claims of intentional infliction of emotional distress and (3) the plaintiffs claim for negligent infliction of emotional distress failed because the plaintiffs employment was not terminated because he was awarded a disability pension. The defendant supported its motion for summary judgment with copies of medical records from the plaintiffs treating physicians, medical reports issued pursuant to three independent medical examinations, deposition testimony and an affidavit from Edwards and Scott Sullivan, the defendant\u2019s highway superintendent.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">The plaintiff objected to the motion for summary judgment, arguing that (1) the defendant\u2019s awarding him a disability pension violated \u00a7 31-290a because it was based on his back injury of March 18, 2002, (2) the defendant assigned him tasks that aggravated his injury, (3) he returned to work capable of doing his job, but the defendant refused to let him do so, (4) the awarding of his disability pension was a case of retaliatory discharge, (5) other employees who sustained injuries were treated differently, and (6) the defendant\u2019s conduct was extreme and outrageous. The plaintiff attached his affidavit, some medical records and correspondence to his objection. The defendant responded to the plaintiffs objection in a memorandum of law, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>arguing that the evidence produced by the plaintiff constituted legal conclusions and did not raise genuine issues of material fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">The court granted the motion for summary judgment in a memorandum of decision on January 17, 2007, and rendered judgment thereon. With respect to the first two counts of the complaint alleging discrimination on the basis of the plaintiffs injury and workers\u2019 compensation claim, the court found that there was no dispute that the plaintiff had engaged in a protected activity and that the defendant\u2019s awarding the plaintiff a disability pension terminated his employment. The court also concluded that the plaintiff failed to present any facts that created a genuine issue of material fact as to the causal relationship between his injury and workers\u2019 compensation claim and the defendant\u2019s awarding him a disability pension. The plaintiff failed to offer any evidence that the defendant had awarded him a disability pension for any reason other than that it could no longer afford to pay him for work he could not perform. Although the plaintiff claimed that the defendant treated him differently from other employees who had suffered work-related injuries, he failed to provide any evidence to substantiate his claim. The court therefore concluded that there were no genuine issues of material fact as to counts one and two and that the defendant was entitled to summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-6\">As to the allegations of count three, the court concluded, citing <em>Pane </em>v. <em>Danbury, </em>267 Conn. 669, 684-86, 841 A.2d 684 (2004), that the defendant was immune from liability for the alleged intentional infliction of emotional distress by its employees. As to the plaintiffs claims of negligent infliction of emotional distress, the court concluded that a municipality cannot be sued directly for common-law negligence and that the plaintiff failed to allege any statute that would abrogate the common law. The defendant, therefore, was entitled to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>summary judgment. The court granted the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment, and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">This court\u2019s review of a trial court\u2019s granting of a motion for summary judgment is plenary in nature. See <em>Reardon </em>v. <em>Windswept Farm, LLC, </em>280 Conn. 153, 158, 905 A.2d 1156 (2006). Our task is to determine \u201cwhether [the trial court\u2019s] conclusions are legally and logically correct and find support in the facts that appear in the record.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Pepitone </em>v. <em>Serman, </em>69 Conn. App. 614, 618, 794 A.2d 1136 (2002). \u201cPractice Book \u00a7 17-49 provides that summary judgment shall be rendered forthwith if the pleadings, affidavits and any other proof submitted show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. In deciding a motion for summary judgment, the trial court must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. . . . The party moving for summary judgment has the burden of showing . . . that the party is . . . entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Kinney </em>v. <em>State, </em>285 Conn. 700, 709, 941 A.2d 907 (2008). \u201cThe test is whether the party moving for summary judgment would be entitled to a directed verdict on the same facts.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Reardon </em>v. <em>Windswept Farm, LLC, </em>supra, 158.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b742-7\">The plaintiff claims that the court improperly granted the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment as to his \u00a7 31-290a claims because the court weighed the evidence rather than deciding whether there were genuine issues of material fact. We disagree. Our review of the record discloses that the court, in its memorandum of decision, did not weigh the evidence but distinguished <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>the character and quality of the alleged evidence produced by the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-5\">\u201cClaims of employment discrimination are evaluated under the burden shifting analysis set forth in <em>Ford </em>v. <em>Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield of Connecticut, Inc., </em>216 Conn. 40, 53-54, 578 A.2d 1054 (1990). . . . Section 31-290a (a) prohibits an employer from discharging or otherwise discriminating against an employee because the employee had filed a claim for workers\u2019 compensation benefits or otherwise exercised her rights under the act. . . . The plaintiff bears the initial burden of proving by the preponderance of the evidence a prima facie case of discrimination. ... In order to meet this burden, the plaintiff must present evidence that gives rise to an inference of unlawful discrimination. ... If the plaintiff meets this initial burden, the burden then shifts to the defendant to rebut the presumption of discrimination by producing evidence of a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its actions. ... If the defendant carries this burden of production, the presumption raised by the prima facie case is rebutted, and the factual inquiry proceeds to a new level of specificity. . . . The plaintiff then must satisfy her burden of persuading the factfinder that she was the victim of discrimination either directly by persuading the [fact-finder] . . . that a discriminatory reason more likely motivated the employer or indirectly by showing that the employer\u2019s proffered explanation is unworthy of credence.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Moran </em>v. <em>Media News Group, Inc., </em>100 Conn. App. 485, 493-94, 918 A.2d 921 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b743-6\">\u201cTo establish a prima facie case of discrimination under \u00a7 31-290a, the plaintiff must show that she was exercising a right afforded her under the [Workers\u2019 Compensation Act (act), General Statutes \u00a7 31-275 et seq.] and that the defendant discriminated against her for exercising that right. . . . [T]he plaintiff must show <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>a casual connection between exercising her rights under the act and the alleged discrimination she suffered. Implicit in this requirement is a showing that the defendant knew or was otherwise aware that the plaintiff had exercised her rights under the act. . . . [T]o establish [a] prima facie case of discrimination, the plaintiff must first present sufficient evidence . . . that is, evidence sufficient to permit a rational trier of fact to find [1] that she engaged in protected [activity] ... [2] that the employer was aware of this activity, [3] that the employer took adverse action against the plaintiff, and [4] that a causal connection exists between the protected activity and the adverse action, i.e., that a retaliatory motive played a part in the adverse employment action . . . .\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Moran </em>v. <em>Media News Group, Inc., </em>supra, 100 Conn. App. 494-95.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-4\">Here, the court determined that there was no genuine issue of material fact that the plaintiff had alleged a prima facie case of discrimination. The parties agree that the plaintiff had engaged in a protected activity by filing a claim for workers\u2019 compensation benefits for his March 18, 2002 injury and that the defendant was aware of it. The court also determined, as a matter of law, that there was no dispute that the plaintiff suffered a materially adverse change in the terms and conditions of his employment. See <em>Sanders </em>v. <em>New York City Human Resources Administration, </em>361 F.3d 749, 755 (2d Cir. 2004) (\u201cadverse employment action [is defined] as a materially adverse change in the terms and conditions of employment. ... To be materially adverse, a change in working conditions must be more disruptive than a mere inconvenience or an alteration of job responsibilities. . . . Examples of such a change include termination of employment, a demotion evidenced by a decrease in wage or salary, a less distinguished title, a material loss of benefits, significantly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>diminished material responsibilities, or other indices . . . unique to a particular situation.\u201d [Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.]).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> There is no dispute that the plaintiff made out a prima facie case. The court\u2019s decision to grant the motion for summary judgment turned on its conclusion that there were no genuine issues of material fact that a causal connection between the plaintiffs exercising his right to workers\u2019 compensation benefits and his disability pension did not exist. That decision concerns the third step of the <em>Ford </em>analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-5\">\u201cA causal connection may be established either <em>indirectly </em>by showing that the protected activity was followed closely by discriminatory treatment, or through other evidence such as disparate treatment of fellow employees who engaged in similar conduct, or <em>directly </em>through evidence of retaliatory animus directed against a plaintiff by a defendant.\u201d (Emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Palma, </em>931 F.2d 203, 207 (2d Cir. 1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b745-6\">In an effort to overcome the inference of discrimination implied by the awarding of the disability pension, the defendant presented evidence that more than two years after the March 18, 2002 work-related injury, the plaintiff still was unable to perform the duties of a master mechanic without restrictions. During that period of time, the defendant provided the plaintiff with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>light duty assignments, and the plaintiff continued to receive workers\u2019 compensation benefits. After two years, however, the defendant could no longer justify the expense of continuing to pay the plaintiff for work that he could no longer perform.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The court ultimately concluded, after reciting the plaintiffs alleged claims of discrimination and the reasons given in his brief, that he had failed to raise any genuine issue of material fact that the defendant\u2019s reason for awarding him a disability pension was anything other than the one proffered by the defendant. To support its conclusion that the defendant had terminated the plaintiffs employment for a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason, the court quoted this court\u2019s decision in <em>Kopacz </em>v. <em>Day Kimball Hospital of Windham County, Inc., </em>64 Conn. App. 263, 779 A.2d 862 (2001). Section \u201c31-290a . . . does not require an employer to retain an employee unable to perform his or her work simply because that inability resulted from a work related injury or illness. . . . Businesses would suffer significant losses if they were prevented from filling employment vacancies after the lapse of a reasonable period of time.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 269.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-5\">On appeal, the plaintiff claims that there is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether there is a causal connection between the exercise of his right to workers\u2019 compensation benefits and the termination of his employment. To establish the necessary dispute , as to material facts, the plaintiff suggested that (1) he was treated in a manner different from that of his co workers, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>Dale Wehmhoff, Douglas Meyers and Joe Bottone, who are white and who were provided light duty assignments; (2) Edwards assigned him work and equipment that aggravated his shoulder injury; (3) the defendant failed to pay him for time he worked in August, 2002; (4) Edwards sent him home despite the plaintiffs having a note from his physician that he was able to work light duty; and (5) the defendant deprived him of certain privileges that were available to his coworkers, i.e., permitting him to work with his disability.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b747-5\">\u201cIt is frequently stated in Connecticut\u2019s case law that, pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 17-45 and 17-46, a party opposing a summary judgment motion must provide an evidentiary foundation to demonstrate the existence of a genuine issue of material fact. . . . [T]ypically [demonstrating a genuine issue requires a showing of evidentiary facts or substantial evidence outside the pleadings from which material facts alleged in the pleadings can be warrantably inferred. . . . Moreover, [t]o establish the existence of a material fact, it is not enough for the party opposing summary judgment merely to assert the existence of a disputed issue. . . . Such assertions are insufficient regardless of whether they are contained in a complaint or a brief. . . . Further, unadmitted allegations in the pleadings do not constitute proof of the existence of a genuine issue as to any material fact.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>McKinney </em>v. <em>Chapman, </em>103 Conn. App. 446, 451, 929 A.2d 355, cert. denied, 284 Conn. 928, 934 A.2d 243 (2007). \u201cMere statements of legal conclusions . . . and bald assertions, without more, are insufficient to raise a genuine issue of material <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>fact capable of defeating summary judgment.\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>Wadia Enterprises, Inc. </em>v. <em>Hirschfeld, </em>27 Conn. App. 162, 170, 604 A.2d 1339, aff'd, 224 Conn. 240, 618 A.2d 506 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b748-5\">With regard to the plaintiffs assertion that he was treated differently from his white coworkers, the court found that he failed to provide details of the coworkers\u2019 duties, injuries or restrictions. The defendant, however, by means of an affidavit from Edwards, presented details of the several injuries that the plaintiff sustained during the course of his employment with the defendant<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and those of Wehmhoff, Meyers and Bot-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>tone.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Edwards attested that there \u201care nine more <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>employees in the building maintenance division . . . than ... in the equipment division. . . . The different functions performed by maintenance or highway divisions provide greater opportunities for long-term, light duty assignments than in the [two]-person equipment maintenance division . . . .\u201d The plaintiff presented no evidence to challenge the evidence presented in Edwards\u2019 affidavit. The court concluded that the plaintiff failed to carry his burden to demonstrate the existence of a genuine issue of material fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-5\">As to the allegation that Edwards once assigned him duties that aggravated his injury, in a deposition the plaintiff testified that he was referring to the shoulder and arm injury he sustained prior to his back injury. The court noted that this action arose from an injury to the plaintiffs back. The court also noted that the plaintiff had litigated the injuries related to his arm and shoulder in a federal civil rights action. See <em>Martin </em>v. <em>Westport, </em>329 F. Sup. 2d 318 (D. Conn. 2004) (alleging claims arising under title VII of Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1981 and 1983, Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12101 et seq., and state statutory and common-law claims). During his deposition, the plaintiff could not recall when Edwards assigned him the tasks of which he complains.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The court properly noted that \u201c[t]o establish the existence of a material fact, it is not enough for the party opposing summary judgment merely to assert the existence of a disputed issue. . . . Such assertions are insufficient regardless of whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>they are contained in a complaint or a brief.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>New Milford Savings Bank </em>v. <em>Roina, </em>38 Conn. App. 240, 244-45, 659 A.2d 1226, cert. denied, 235 Conn. 915, 665 A.2d 609 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">The plaintiff also contends that with regard to the medical records submitted by the parties, the court made a decision to believe the evidence submitted by the defendant rather than the plaintiffs evidence. Before beginning our analysis of this contention, it is important to note that in his brief, the plaintiff has failed to distinguish between what he believes to have happened and evidence that supports his version of the events. The defendant, however, has referred us to specific documents and statements in evidence to support its reason for terminating the plaintiffs employment. The plaintiff has failed to draw our attention to facts in a document or testimony that counter the facts relied on by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-6\">The essence of the plaintiffs claim is that the defendant discriminated against him because he has a 5 percent disability of his back. To support this claim, he relies on the fact that none of the three physicians retained by the defendant to evaluate him stated literally that he is not able to perform the duties of a master mechanic due to his back injury. The plaintiff quoted portions of the reports submitted by the three physicians. Kenneth M. Kramer, an orthopedic surgeon, stated in part in his report of June 22, 2004, that the plaintiff \u201cshould be on permanent restrictions with regard to the . . . injury, consisting of a [thirty-five] pound lifting restriction with no repetitive lifting or bending.\u201d The July 7, 2004 report of Eric M. Garver, an orthopedic surgeon, provides in part that the plaintiff \u201cdoes have a prior history, many years ago, with his right arm as having had an ulnar nerve transposition in the right elbow following a work related injury, <em>however, the [plaintiff] had returned to work. ... At this </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number><em>point it appears that his [low] back is giving him less of a problem.\u201d </em>(Emphasis in original.) The plaintiff quoted from a portion of a report dated July 13, 2004, prepared by a rehabilitation physician, Gary D. Solomon, that \u201ccurrently, [the plaintiff] states that he is virtually pain free except for occasional recurrences of back pain, usually attributed to cold weather. He currently states that he is [able] to bend, twist, turn and lift without recurrence of pain complaints.\u201d Those quotations, however, do not place the physicians\u2019 conclusions in proper context.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-5\">The defendant made the physicians\u2019 complete reports available for the court to review, in addition to reports from Polifroni. On the basis of its review of the medical records, the court found that on May 20, 2004, Polifroni stated that the plaintiff \u201cmay have difficulty going back to any job that requires physical activities . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In an August 9, 2004 report, Polifroni stated that the plaintiff \u201cshould limit his strenuous activities because of his back.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Kramer stated that the plaintiff \u201cshould be on permanent restrictions . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Garver stated that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>plaintiff \u201cis able to work light duty. He would be unable to do heavy lifting or repetitively use the right upper extremity.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> In his report of July 13, 2004, Solomon stated, in part, that the plaintiff \u201cis not capable of performing full duty work as a master mechanic without restrictions . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The plaintiff has not brought to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>the attention of the trial court or this court an opinion from any physician that he is capable of performing all of the duties of a master mechanic despite his multiple injuries. There is, therefore, no genuine issue of material fact as to the plaintiffs inability to perform the job for which the defendant had engaged his services.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-4\">The plaintiff relies on a handwritten return to work noted signed by Stewart C. Gross, the physician who treated the plaintiff for the shoulder injury he sustained in 1999. On the note, dated \u201c8-8-04,\u201d Gross marked an X in the box next to the language \u201cmay return to regular duty work on\u201d and added \u201c10/15/01 &amp; is still in effect as of 8-6-04.\u201d When he was deposed, Gross testified that the plaintiff never told him that he, the plaintiff, had sustained a lower back injury.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b754-5\">On the basis of our review of the court\u2019s memorandum of decision and the documents submitted to the court for its review when considering the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment, we conclude that the court did not weigh the evidence but, rather, reviewed it, as it was required to do, in deciding the motion for summary judgment. We also conclude that the court did not improperly find that there is no genuine issue of material fact concerning the lack of a causal connection between the defendant\u2019s having awarded the plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>a disability pension and his work-related injury of March 18, 2002, and the exercise of his rights under our workers\u2019 compensation laws. In other words, there is no genuine issue of material fact that the defendant terminated the plaintiffs employment because he could not work as a master mechanic and not for a discriminatory reason. For those reasons, the court properly rendered summary judgment in favor of the defendant on counts one and two of the plaintiff\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b755-6\">The plaintiff\u2019s third claim is that the court improperly determined that governmental immunity barred his claims of negligent and intentional infliction of emotional distress. This claim lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-7\">\u201cThe general rule is that governments and their agents are immune from liability for acts conducted in performance of their official duties. The common-law doctrine of governmental immunity has been statutorily enacted and is now largely codified in General Statutes \u00a7 52-557n.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Durrant </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>96 Conn. App. 456, 474, 900 A.2d 608 (2006) <em>(Schaller, J., </em>dissenting), rev\u2019d on other grounds, 284 Conn. 91, 931 A.2d 859 (2007). Section 52-557n provides in relevant part: \u201c(a) (1) Except as otherwise provided by law, a political subdivision of the state shall be liable for damages to person or property caused by: (A) The negligent acts or omissions of such political subdivision or any employee, officer or agent thereof acting within the scope of his employment or official duties ... (2) Except as otherwise provided by law, a political subdivision of the state shall not be liable for damages to person or property caused by: (A) Acts or omissions of any employee, officer or agent which constitute criminal conduct, fraud, actual malice or wilful misconduct . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b756-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>In ruling on the allegations of negligent and intentional infliction of emotional distress, the court properly concluded that a municipality may not be held hable for the intentional acts of its employees pursuant to \u00a7 52-557n (a) (2) (A), including intentional infliction of emotional distress. See <em>Pane </em>v. <em>Danbury, </em>supra, 267 Conn. 684-86.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-4\">The court found that the plaintiff had not alleged any statute that would abrogate the defendant\u2019s governmental immunity for negligent infliction of emotional distress. On appeal, the plaintiff argues that he alleges Edwards\u2019 name in his complaint,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> which is sufficient to invoke General Statutes \u00a7 7-465. In support of this contention, the plaintiff relies on <em>Williams </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>243 Conn. 763, 707 A.2d 1251 (1998). We disagree that <em>Williams </em>supports the plaintiffs position. In <em>Williams, </em>the plaintiffs brought an action against the city of New Haven but \u201cdid not name any agent, employee or officer of the municipality as a <em>defendant </em>. . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id., 765. The plaintiffs also did not allege any statute that abrogates governmental immunity or seek indemnification pursuant to \u00a7 7-465. Id., 769. Our Supreme Court held that the plaintiffs could not prevail. Id., 765. On procedural grounds, this case is indistinguishable from <em>Williams, </em>and the court properly granted the motion for summary judgment as to the plaintiffs claims for negligent infliction of emotional distress.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-5\">The plaintiff further argues that he alleged a violation of \u00a7 31-290a and that the defendant subjected itself to the requirements of our workers\u2019 compensation laws. Our workers\u2019 compensation scheme provides a cause of action against an employer who discriminates against an employee because the employee has filed a workers\u2019 compensation claim. It does not create liability for all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>torts and does not create a statutory basis for the abrogation of governmental immunity as to other torts. Moreover, during oral argument, counsel for the plaintiff conceded that damages for emotional distress may be alleged in a cause of action brought pursuant \u00a7 31-290a. The plaintiffs claims for damages for emotional distress, therefore, were encompassed in counts one and two.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b737-9\"> General Statutes \u00a7 31-290a, entitled \u201cDischarge or discrimination prohibited. Right of action,\u201d provides in relevant part: \u201c(a) No employer who is subject to the provisions of this chapter shall discharge, or cause to be discharged, or in any manner discriminate against any employee because the employee has filed a claim for workers\u2019 compensation benefits or otherwise exercised the rights afforded to him pursuant to the provisions of this chapter.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b738-6\"> The court noted that in count one, the plaintiff alleged that the defendant discriminated against him in violation of \u00a7 31-290a because he sustained a work-related ir\\jury. In count two, the plaintiff alleged that the defendant discriminated against him in violation of \u00a7 31-290a because he filed a claim for workers\u2019 compensation benefits. Because the plaintiff failed to demonstrate how the allegations of count one and count two were different, the court analyzed the claims together. The plaintiff has not challenged the court\u2019s decision on that basis. We likewise will consider the allegations in counts one and two together.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b745-7\"> In its memorandum of law in support of its motion for summary judgment, the defendant maintained that it had not terminated the plaintiffs employment. There was no factual dispute, however, that the defendant had awarded the plaintiff a disability pension. \u201cSection 31-290a (a) contains no requirement that any particular word be used in the process of terminating an employee\u2019s employment. Any words or conduct that an employee would reasonably understand to signify that his employment was terminated are sufficient.\u201d <em>Loftus </em>v. <em>Vincent, </em>49 Conn. App. 66, 69, 713 A.2d 892 (1998). The court concluded that the plaintiff reasonably could have understood that his employment had been terminated. On appeal, the defendant does not challenge the court\u2019s legal conclusion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b746-6\"> The defendant presented the court with the minutes of its public works pension board meeting of August 10, 2004, that stated in part that the defendant \u201cinitiated [the plaintiffs] disability retirement consideration based upon the determination by four (4) physicians that, as a result of his injuries, [the plaintiff] could not perform the duties of Ms position and would not be able to do so in the future. [The] applicable provision of the collective bargaining agreement with [the plaintiffs] umon was Article IX Section 3.

The plaintiff, however, has failed to provide any analysis of or evidence to support those claims. Without legal analysis with references to law, we deem the plaintiffs claims abandoned.

I think at this time his injuries are permanent. I think he may have difficulty going back to any job that requires physical activities though he was doing light work at his previous job without much intervention with his lower back but his injuries at this time are probably permanent and he sustained a lumbar sprain. I do not expect much improvement.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b752-7\"> Polifroni\u2019s complete August 9, 2004 note states that \u201c[i]n reference to my note of May 20, 2004, I did not state that [the plaintiff] was unable to work.

In accordance with [America Medical Association] [g]uidelines, he has a DRE category 2, 5 [percent] permanent partial impairment on the basis of the chronic lumbar strain, which in medical probability is directly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>causally related to the work incident of 3/18/02. He should be on permanent restrictions with regard to [this] injury, consisting of a [thirty-five] pound lifting restriction with no repetitive lifting or bending. As a spinal specialist, not caring for shoulder problems, any analogous assessments regarding the shoulder must be deferred to the specialists who are caring for this condition.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b753-6\"> The entire discussion portion of Garver\u2019s report states: \u201cAt this point I believe the patient is able to work light duty. He would be unable to do heavy lifting or repetitively use the right upper extremity. It is certainly reasonable to proceed as Dr. Gross has suggested with carpal tunnel release of the right hand inasmuch as this is a relatively minimal procedure. Whether the patient should have a re-exploration of his right elbow at the same time is an interesting question. On one hand he is certainly having significant difficulty and it is possible this may give him some improvement if there is entrapped scar found at the time of surgery- On the other hand since this has been persistent for a long period of time I am somewhat pessimistic that this will lead to a great deal of improvement at the elbow. The patient is having no active therapy at this time, which I find strange. Certainly the patient should have some range of motion and strengthening for the right upper extremity especially including the shoulder. Therefore, I believe the patient is disabled with respect to his right upper extremity, however, the patient is able to work selected light duty at this time. It is reasonable to proceed with at least a portion of the recommended surgical procedures.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b753-7\"> The impression portion of Solomon\u2019s independent medical report states in full: \u201c[The plaintiff] presents with a history of multiple injuries to his lower back, right shoulder and right upper extremity following a work related injury which occurred on March 18, 2002 when he slipped on a step while climbing onto a street sweeper.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-8\">\u201c[The plaintiff] further sustained an aggravation of his right upper extremity injuries when he sustained a [second] work related injury while fixing a brake line in 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-9\">\u201cHe also presents with evidence of carpal tunnel syndrome, which has been attributed to repetitive trauma from his work as a master mechanic.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-10\">\u201cI have also reviewed the job requirements of a master mechanic as outlined by the Department of Public Works, Equipment Maintenance Division, Town of Westport.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-11\">\u201cIt is my opinion that [the plaintiff] is not capable of performing full duty work as a master mechanic without restrictions due to persistent injuries to his right shoulder and right upper extremity which include multiple <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>tendinitis as well as ulnar and median nerve neuropathies.
