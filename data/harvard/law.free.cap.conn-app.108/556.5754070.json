On appeal, the defendant claims that the trial court abused its discretion and deprived him of his right to an impartial jury when it (1) discharged a regular juror and replaced her with the alternate juror and (2) denied his motion for a continuance.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Although we conclude that the court abused its discretion under the circumstances of this case, we nevertheless affirm the judgment because the record is inadequate to conclude that the defendant was prejudiced.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-8\">The charge against the defendant arose from an incident that occurred on the afternoon of November 22, 2003, in Stratford. Two police officers were dispatched to an accident involving the defendant\u2019s vehicle and a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>parked, unoccupied vehicle. The defendant was not driving his vehicle at the time the officers arrived at the scene, and they could not recall whether he was inside or outside of the vehicle when they first approached him. A front tire of the defendant\u2019s vehicle was flat, and there was damage to the front end area. The parked vehicle was damaged in the left rear area. Upon questioning the defendant, the officers detected the odor of alcohol on his breath and observed that he was unsteady on his feet. After failing certain field sobriety tests, the defendant was arrested and transported to the Stratford police station.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-4\">The defendant elected to be tried by a jury. During jury selection, the defendant exhausted his peremptory challenges after the selection of five jurors. At that point he requested two additional challenges, and that request was denied by the court. After the sixth juror was accepted, the court indicated that counsel were to select one alternate juror. At the conclusion of the voir dire of juror T,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> counsel for the defendant challenged him for cause. The court refused to excuse T for cause, and T became the alternate juror. The defendant did not seek any additional peremptory challenges at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">After jury selection had been completed, the court indicated that outstanding pretrial motions would be heard on Tuesday, May 31, 2005, at 10 a.m. and that the jury would be sworn immediately thereafter. When counsel arrived the morning of May 31, the court informed them that all of the jurors were not present because of \u201ca miscommunication of some kind.\u201d Although the court told the selected jurors that they were to report on May 31, one of the jurors, M, additionally was told to contact the jury administrator before coming that day in the event of a change in the schedule. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>Any caller who telephoned the number provided was connected to a recorded message and instructed not to report until contacted by the court. Most of the jurors had not telephoned the designated number and came to the courthouse as originally instructed. The clerk was trying to contact the jurors who had not appeared, and the court was hopeful that all would be reached and available by the time the arguments on the outstanding motions had concluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-4\">After the luncheon recess, the court informed counsel that six of the seven jurors were at the courthouse. The court reported that M, one of the six selected jurors, however, had \u201cchild care responsibilities\u201d and was unable to make alternative arrangements. The alternate was available to replace her, and the court stated that counsel would proceed with the trial that afternoon. Counsel for the defendant objected to proceeding with the alternate as a regular member of the jury and requested that the court continue the trial until the following morning. The court overruled the objection. Counsel then concluded their arguments on the outstanding motions, and the trial commenced later that afternoon. The jury found the defendant guilty of operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor or drugs. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">The defendant claims that the court abused its discretion in denying his motion for a continuance. The defendant argues that in denying that motion, thereby excusing M and replacing her with T, he was deprived of his right to an impartial jury. We agree that the court abused its discretion in denying the defendant\u2019s motion for a continuance, but we cannot conclude, on the basis of the record before us, that the defendant was prejudiced by that denial.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">\u201cThe determination of whether to grant a request for a continuance is within the discretion of the trial court, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>and will not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion. ... A reviewing court is bound by the principle that [e]very reasonable presumption in favor of the proper exercise of the trial court\u2019s discretion will be made. ... To prove an abuse of discretion, an appellant must show that the trial court\u2019s denial of a request for a continuance was arbitrary. . . . There are no mechanical tests for deciding when a denial of a continuance is so arbitrary as to violate due process. The answer must be found in the circumstances present in every case, particularly in the reasons presented to the trial judge at the time the request is denied. . . . In addition, we consistently have acknowledged that [o]ur role as an appellate court is not to substitute our judgment for that of a trial court that has chosen one of many reasonable alternatives. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b586-6\">\u201cWe have articulated a number of factors that appropriately may enter into an appellate court\u2019s review of a trial court\u2019s exercise of its discretion in denying a motion for a continuance. Although resistant to precise cataloguing, such factors revolve around the circumstances before the trial court at the time it rendered its decision, including: the timeliness of the request for continuance; the likely length of the delay; the age and complexity of the case; the granting of other continuances in the past; the impact of delay on the litigants, witnesses, opposing counsel and the court; the perceived legitimacy of the reasons proffered in support of the request; [and] the defendant\u2019s personal responsibility for the timing of the request ....</p>\n<p id=\"b586-7\">\u201cIn the event that the trial court acted unreasonably in denying a continuance, the reviewing court must also engage in harmless error analysis. ... In connection with this inquiry into harmless error, [w]e distinguish between two types of cases: those in which a constitutional right has been implicated by a denial of a continuance, and those of a nonconstitutional nature. . . . <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>Although prejudice is presumed in instances in which a defendant has suffered a deprivation of a constitutional right, in order to establish reversible error in nonconstitutional claims, the defendant must prove both an abuse of discretion and harm . . . .\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Coney, </em>266 Conn. 787, 801-802, 835 A.2d 977 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">In the present case, through no fault of the defendant, a regular member of the jury, M, was not present on May 31, 2005. On the first day of jury selection, two jurors were accepted and were told that the trial would commence on May 31. No jurors were selected on the second day of jury selection. On the third day of jury selection, the remaining four regular jurors were accepted, and T, the alternate, was accepted by the state and challenged for cause by the defendant. When the court refused to excuse T for cause, he was added to the jury. The court informed the third and sixth jurors selected, as well as the alternate juror, that the trial would commence May 31 and asked them to provide emergency telephone numbers. With respect to the fourth juror and M, however, the court indicated that the trial would probably commence May 31 but that there was a possibility it would be delayed until the following day.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-7\">When M was selected, she particularly was concerned about the starting date of the trial. M taught at a middle school and had to make arrangements to procure a substitute teacher in her absence. The court told her to plan on being at the courthouse on May 31, but she also was told to telephone the jury administrator after 5 p.m. on Friday, May 27, or over the weekend for a recorded message in the event the schedule changed.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>The recorded message specifically instructed jurors for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>the case not to come in until further contacted by the court. Having heard the recorded message, M did not appear on May 31, and, when contacted by the clerk, stated that she was unable to make the necessary arrangements in order to be present that day in court.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">Immediately after the luncheon recess, but before counsel had concluded their arguments on outstanding pretrial motions, the court informed counsel about M\u2019s inability to be present that day and indicated that they would be proceeding with T, the alternate juror, as the sixth juror. Counsel for the defendant objected. She stated that she would not have selected T as a member of the jury <em>if </em>the defendant had not exhausted his peremptory challenges. She requested that the trial commence the following morning, when M would be available. The court denied that request without giving any reason for its decision other than that the alternate was selected in the same manner as the regular jurors were selected.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>In determining whether the trial court abused its discretion in denying the defendant\u2019s motion for a continuance, we look to the previously articulated factors. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Coney, </em>supra, 266 Conn. 801-802. The defendant timely made his request for a continuance. As soon as the court indicated that M could not be present that day and that the trial would proceed with T as the sixth juror, defense counsel objected and requested the continuance. The length of delay was a few hours at most. Counsel proceeded to conclude their arguments on outstanding motions that afternoon, and the trial commenced immediately thereafter. Although the transcript does not reflect the exact time that the jury was sworn, it does reflect that only one witness was called that afternoon and that her testimony had not concluded when court was adjourned.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">The state did not object to the defendant\u2019s request for a continuance. At oral argument before this court, the state conceded that \u201cpresumably\u201d it would not have been inconvenienced by the delay because it had no expert witnesses scheduled to testify on May 31. Sarah Patrick, one of the arresting police officers, testified that afternoon. Patrick had testified earlier that day in connection with one of the defendant\u2019s outstanding motions. Patrick\u2019s testimony before the jury did not conclude that day; she returned the next day for continued cross-examination by defense counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-7\">We next look to the legitimacy of the reasons proffered for the request for a continuance. The defendant wanted to be tried by the six regular members of the jury. He did not want to proceed with the alternate, T, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>in place of M. During jury selection, the defendant had challenged T for cause,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and the court refused that request. The defendant could not exercise a peremptory challenge because they had been exhausted, and the court had refused to grant his request for additional challenges. M was not present because she had been told to telephone the jury administrator\u2019s office and, by a recorded message, had been instructed not to come to court until contacted by the court. M was unable to make alternative arrangements for that day but was available for the remainder of the trial. When presented with these reasons, the court summarily stated that \u201cwe\u2019re proceeding today and we\u2019re proceeding with six,\u201d and \u201c[t]he alternate was selected just like everybody else.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b591-4\">Even though we afford great deference to a court\u2019s ruling on a motion for a continuance, we conclude that the court\u2019s denial was unreasonable and arbitrary under the unique circumstances of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">Having concluded that the court abused its discretion in denying the defendant\u2019s motion for a continuance, we must next determine whether he was prejudiced by that denial. \u201cIn the event that the trial court acted unreasonably in denying a continuance, the reviewing court must also engage in harmless error analysis.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Coney, </em>supra, 266 Conn. 802. The defendant claims that he was deprived of his sixth amendment right to an impartial jury. He provides no analysis or case law, however, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>support of this contention. Because the defendant has failed to assert a plausible constitutional claim, he bears the burden of showing that he was harmed by the denial of his motion for a continuance.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">Although the defendant challenged T for cause during jury selection, he did not request additional peremptory challenges after the court refused to excuse T for cause. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Ross, </em>269 Conn. 213, 230, 849 A.2d 648 (2004); <em>State </em>v. <em>Esposito, </em>223 Conn. 299, 313, 613 A.2d 242 (1992). Whether the court improperly denied the defendant\u2019s request to excuse T for cause is not an issue on appeal. T was added to the jury as an alternate juror and became a regular member when the court excused M. Alternate jurors, by statute, must have the same qualifications and be selected in the same manner as regular jurors. General Statutes 54-82h (a).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The defendant has not demonstrated any specific harm resulting from the court\u2019s replacement of M by T, the alternate juror. We cannot presume that T was not an impartial juror under these circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b583-9\"> In his brief on appeal, the defendant raised two additional issues concerning the denial of his motion for a judgment of acquittal with respect to the operation of the vehicle and the denial of his motion to preclude certain statements of one of the arresting officers. The defendant withdrew those two claims at the time of argument before this court, and we therefore do not address them.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b584-6\"> We refer to the jurors by initial to protect their legitimate privacy interests. <em>State </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>86 Conn.
