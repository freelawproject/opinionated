Code of Procedure, \u00a7 317, as amended by Laws 1851, c. 479, provides that: \u201c Whenever any claim against a deceased person shall be referred pursuant to the provisions of the Revised Statutes, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover the fees of referees and witnesses, and other necessary disbursements, to be taxed according to law.\u201d</summary>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b270-10\">Argued before Van Brunt, P.

The claimant recovered a judgment. She concedes on this appeal, that she was not entitled to costs, but insists that she should have been allowed the fees of the referee and witnesses and other necessary disbursements. The question thus raised has been passed upon adversely to the contention of the appellant by the general term of the Third department, which held in the case of <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>32 Hun, 481, that section 3246 of the Code of Civil Procedure is a substitute for section 317 of the old Code, and withholds from the successful claimant the right to disbursements which he had under the latter section. There was no \u25a0error in the action of the court below, and the order there made should be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
