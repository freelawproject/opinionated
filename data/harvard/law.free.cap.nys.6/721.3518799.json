Action by E. Willard Boies to foreclose a mortgage. The plaintiff and the- \u2022 defendant Sarah Benliam eacli held a mortgage given by the defendant Gardner on the 11th of March, 1884, upon premises which the plaintiff on the same-day conveyed to Gardner. The price of the premises was $1,800, $100 of which Gardner had paid to the plaintiff. Gardner borrowed $1,000 of defendant Benliam, and $900 of it to and e a for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>$800, and at the same time gave a mortgage to Benham for the $1,000. The transactions took place at the same time and place, and it was agreed that the two mortgages should be recorded at the same time, and they were both so recorded. The mortgage to the plaintiff recited that it was given to secure payment of a portion of the purchase money. The mortgage to Benham did not so recite. The conversation of the parties at the time of the execution of the mortgages was given in evidence, the contention of the defendant Benham being that it was agreed that her mortgage should be of equal lien with that of the plaintiff. The referee finds that the mortgages were of equal date, that both were given for the purchase money, and both by agreement recorded of equal date; but does not find that it was agreed that they should be of equal lien, and does find that the plaintiff never parted or intended to part with his equitable lien upon said premises for the purchase money; and thereupon found that the plaintiff\u2019s mortgage had the priority of lien. The defendant Sarah Benham appeals.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b738-5\">Argued before Learned, P.

The vendor\u2019s lien for the purchase money is prior to any other lien which the vendee can give upon the land except by the vendor\u2019s consent, expressly given, or implied from his acts or omissions. <em>Dusenbury </em>v. <em>Hulbert, </em>59 N. <em>Y. </em>541; <em>Ellis </em>v. <em>Horrman, </em>90 N. Y. 466; <em>French </em>v. <em>Le Roy, </em>15 Wkly. Dig. 269. The vendor\u2019s equitable lien is waived by taking a mortgage.. <em>Fish </em>v. <em>Howland, </em>1 Paige, 20. The referee has found that the plaintiff did not part with his equitable lien. Upon examination of the evidence we think the defendant did not quite make it appear that the plaintiff consented to admit her mortgage to an equality of lien with his own, and hence did not maintain the burden she assumed. The case of <em>French </em>v. <em>Le Roy, </em>above cited, was fully as strong for the defendant as is the present, but the equitable lien prevailed. The defendant urges that because the referee has found that the mortgage to her was also given for the purchase money, it is thus admitted to an equality with plaintiff\u2019s mortgage in that respect, and because it stands equal in date and record all the requisites of equality are shown. The money for which the mortgage was given to Benham was purchase money to the amount of $900, as between Benham and the purchaser, in the sense that the purchaser could not by agreement with third persons give to them alien upon the land prior toBenham\u2019s. Benham\u2019s equity is in like manner and for like reasons as superior to that which the purchaser can give to third persons as the plaintiff\u2019s equity is superior to hers. The land comes from the plaintiff. Until the purchase price is secured to him his grantee has nothing to mortgage to Benham. That security given, then the grantee can mortgage to Benham, subject to plaintiff\u2019s prior lien. Benham, having advanced part of the purchase price, is equitably entitled to whatever security the land can afford him, before the judgment liens, dower right, or mortgages of third persons, who have advanced nothing towards vesting the legal title to the land in the grantee, can be allowed. This is the extent to which the money lent by Benbain and paid to the plaintiff becomes purchase money. <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Austin, </em>15 Johns. 477; <em>Cunningham </em>v. <em>Knight, </em>1 Barb. 399; <em>Kittle </em>v. <em>Van Dyck, </em>1 Sandf.
