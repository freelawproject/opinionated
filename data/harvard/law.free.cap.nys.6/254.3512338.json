The plaintiffs here, the attaching creditors, have certainly made out a <em>prima facie </em>case sufficient to justify the retention of such proceeds <em>pendente lite. </em>Without passing upon the merits in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>any way, we think under these circumstances that the proceeds should be held to await the final determination of the action. The facts bring the case within the principle of <em>Kingsley </em>v. Bank, 31 Hun, 329, and the injunction <em>pendente lite </em>is supported by <em>Keller </em>v. <em>Payne, </em>1 N. Y Supp. 148, and cases there cited. The order should be affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
