At the time the assessment in question was made there stood upon the said lot, fronting on Bridge street, a brick church used by said society exclusively for public worship; and also fronting on the same street, and separated from said church by \u201ca narrow space,\u201d a wooden building, erected and used by said association exclusively for a parsonage, and occupied by the pastor of said church as a dwelling-house. The pastor receives an annual salary, the parsonage being furnished for his use by the society. Upon the rear of said lot are \u201csheds for horses, and a barn erected and used for the accommodation and comfort of the teams and horses of those who may attend public worship at said church.\u201d The greater portion of the entire parcel of land is covered by the erections aforesaid.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b878-15\">Argued before Hardin, P.

St., as amended by chapter 397, Laws 1883; <em>second, </em>that the assessment is void for not contain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"863\">*863</page-number>ing a description nor giving the quantity of land to be taxed. The first proposition is fully discussed by Mr. Justice Vann in the opinion delivered by him at special term upon malting the order appealed from. There is no occasion for any further discussion of the subject. We agree with him in his view that the parsonage was not exempt. The second proposition does not seem to have been raised at special term. It is not stated in the writ of, <em>certiorari </em>as a ground for relief, nor does it appear to have been raised before the assessors, although upon grievance day the relators appeared before them, and asked for relief on the other ground. It is, however, stated in the petition upon which the writ was granted. The assessment was against \u201cTrustees First Congregational Church,\u201d the property assessed was described \u201cParsonage,\u201d and the valuation was entered \u201c$1,600.\u201d The description did not mislead the relators. <em>Tallman </em>v. <em>White, </em>2 N. Y. 66. There was no doubt about the identity. Presumptively it was so much of the lotas was covered by the parsonage. It was understood to be a real-estate assessment; so alleged, in substance, in the petition. The absence of a statement of the quantity, if important under the charter of the village, (chapter 639, Laws 1868, as amended by chapter 257, Laws 1888, tit. 4, \u00a7 6,) is not a source of any injury to the relators. As said in <em>People </em>v. <em>Parker, </em>45 Hun, 432, injury must be shown, or the alleged illegality will be unavailing under the act of 1880. Ho question is made about the valuation. We think there is nothing in the form of the assessment that presents here any good ground for disturbing the order. The order should be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
