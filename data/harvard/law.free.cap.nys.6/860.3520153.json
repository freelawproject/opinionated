Sackett, to recover the value of 50.71 bushels of buckwheat sold and delivered to defendant on 8th November, 1886. It was shown that upon that day the buckwheat was delivered by plaintiff to and received by defendant, and that its value was 45 cents a bushel; that the plaintiff demanded pay, and defendant refused, claiming that plaintiff had sold him 200 bushels, and he would pay when the rest was delivered. The defendant put in evidence the following paper, signed by plaintiff: \u201c Watkins, N. Y., Nov. 4,1886. I agree to deliver to the Seneca Lake Steam-Mills, Watkins, N. Y., about 200 bushels of buckwheat, at 45 cents per bushel of 50 lbs., on or about the 15th of Nov., 1886; quality, dry and clean. Sold through Vernon C. Huey. Geo. Van Gorden. \u201d It appears that defendant was proprietor of Seneca Lake Steam-Mills, and was running them, in 1886, and that Huey was his agent to purchase buckwheat, and made the arrangement with plaintiff in pursuance of which plaintiff made the delivery. In testifying to the transaction with Huey, plaintiff said: \u201cI told him I had about 100 bushels to sell. 1 told him it was partnership buckwheat. My share would be about 100 bushels. He wrote the contract for about 200 bushels. He said the other party could draw in theirs. I told him I didn\u2019t think they would draw it. Hadn't seen them. I told him there might be a kick about paying for it. He said, &lt; No,\u2019 draw in what I had; to tell them that it fell short, and it would be all right, and I would get my money. This was before the contract was signed.\u201d The plaintiff delivered all he had, except what he saved for his own use.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b877-7\">Argued before Hardin, P. J\u201e and Merwin and Martin, JJ.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b877-8\"><em>O. P. Hurd, </em>for appellant. <em>W. L. Norton, </em>for respondent.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b877-9\">Merwin, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ag9M\">Assuming that the instrument of November 4,1886, was not defective by reason of its failure to designate the name of the buyer, except as it might be inferred from the designation \u201cSeneca Lake Steam-Mills, \u201d and the name of the agent, Huey, and assuming that the quantity was sufficiently definite for enforcement, still it was not valid without a consideration to support it. In <em>Justice </em>v. <em>Lang, </em>42 N. Y. 493, it was held that the use in such an instrument of the expression \u201ccash upon.such delivery\u201d implied a promise on the part of the party taking it to pay the price when the goods should be delivered, which promise furnished sufficient consideration for the agreement to deliver. In the same case it was afterwards held in the court of appeals (52 N. Y. 323) that it was a question of fact for the jury to determine whether or not there was a promise to receive and pay for the goods. The present case is not so strong for the buyer as the case cited; for here the words \u201ccash upon delivery\u201d are not in the .paper. There is nothing as to the time or manner of payment. So that if we should assume that the justice, in finding for the plaintiff, found in effect that there was no promise on the part of the defendant to accept and pay, and therefore no consideration for the instrument, it would be questionable whether we ought to disturb such conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-10\">But there is another view of the case. It was competent to show by paroi what the consideration was, and what obligation was, by the bargain, as in fact made, upon the defendant. <em>Chapin v. Dobson, </em>78 N. Y. 74; <em>Eighmie </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>98 N. Y. 294; <em>Juilliard </em>v. <em>Chaffee, </em>92 N. Y. 535; Benj. Sales, (2d Ed.,) \u00a7 232. In this view evidence was given from which the justice had the right to find, as a part of the bargain, that the plaintiff might draw what buckwheat he had, and he would have his pay, without reference to whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"862\">*862</page-number>the party who owned the rest drew his share. This would not necessarily be inconsistent with the writing, but would relate to the time and manner of payment. If such was the bargain, the defendant, after receiving and keeping the plaintiff\u2019s share, would not be in a position to assert the entirety of the contract, but would be bound to pay for what he received, and resort to his claim for damages, if the balance was not delivered. Ho damages are shown. The judgment should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-5\">Hardin, P. J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<p id=\"b878-6\">Martin, J.</p>\n<p id=\"ANxa\">I concur upon the ground that there was no written contract between the parties, and lienee it was competent to show the agreement, under which the buckwheat in question was delivered, by paroi evidence.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
