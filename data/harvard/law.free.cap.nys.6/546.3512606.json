The respondent, in opposition, showed that the premises had been sold for non-payment of such taxes on March 9, 1874, and that a lease had been delivered to the purchaser. The issues were brought on for trial before the special term, and a trial by jury was waived. Upon such trial it was held that the sale was valid, and that, upon the whole case, the relator was not entitled to the relief prayed for in the writ, although the notice to redeem, required by law to be published before the execution and delivery of the lease, was insufficient and void. From the final order entered to this effect the present appeal is taken. Under the decision of <em>Clarke </em>v. <em>Mayor, etc., </em>55 N. Y. Super. Ct. 259, the sale was not void for any of the reasons urged by the relator. On the other hand, the insufficiency and invalidity of the notice to redeem has been determined in <em>Donahue </em>v. <em>O'Conor, </em>45 N. Y. Super. Ct. 278, and this is conceded by the counsel for the respondent. The case, therefore, stands as if no notice to redeem had ever been given, but this circumstance, under the doctrine of <em>Clarke </em>v. <em>Mayor, etc., supra, </em>does not render the sale invalid. The relator, therefore, was not entitled to the relief prayed for. Upon the present appeal, however, the point was raised that the amount tendered to the clerk of arrears was sufficient, not only for the payment of the taxes, with interest, as required by the statutes, but also for the redemption of the premises from the sale, and that, consequently, redemption should have been decreed. This is controverted by the counsel for the respondent. The determination of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>point involves the construction of sections 941 and 943 of the consolidation act, in view of the policy of the whole act as regards redemption; and, if it were necessary ro make such determination, the question involved would be an intricate and serious one. But I do not think that it is necessary. The point was not raised below, and should not be entertained on appeal for the first time, .against the objection of the respondent. The application of the relator was that the respondent should be compelled to receive payment, and to deliver receipted bills of the taxes, etc. That application is somewhat inconsistent with and antagonistic to an application to redeem. The first denies and ignores the rights of the purchaser, while the second respects them. The one requires a tender of money to the corporation of the city of Hew York in payment of taxes, the other a tender of money \u201cto the use of the purchaser.\u201d This being so, the relator should have amended her application, if that could have been done, so as to be in a position to claim redemption. Such amendment was not applied for, nor was the court below requested in any way to order redemption. In no aspect of the case, therefore, can it be held that there was error in refusing redemption. The order should be affirmed with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
