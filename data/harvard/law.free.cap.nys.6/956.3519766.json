The reasons for such conclusion will be found in the opinion delivered in the case of <em>People </em>v. <em>Burns, ante, </em>611, which was argued at the same term of this court. The facts and questions of law involved in this case are substantially the same as those contained \u25a0in the case referred to. The judgment of the court of sessions must be af\u2022firmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
