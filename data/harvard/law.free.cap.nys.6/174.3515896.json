Plaintiff testified that he caught his wife and defendant in an act of adultery. His evidence was objected to on the ground that he was incompetent to testify, under Code Civil Proc. H.

The plaintiff\u2019s business called him away from home every other night, and the defendant was a regular visitor of his wife on the occasions of the absence of the husband. O\u2019Brien is proven to have ridden out with his wife, and she was seen in the stone-yard near her residence in company with the defendant quite late at night. There is beyond this the most direct proof of guilt given by the plaintiff. Section 831 of the Code does not apply to actions where the husband seeks to recover damages for alienation of a wife\u2019s affection. The wife is not a party, and the evidence is not strictly against her. The judgment should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-18\">Pratt, J., concurs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
