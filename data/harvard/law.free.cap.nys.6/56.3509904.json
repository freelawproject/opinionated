The defendant, by the direction of the commissioner of highways, dug gravel from the plaintiff\u2019s land between the traveled part of the road and the plaintiff\u2019s fence, and carried it away, and put it on other parts of the road within the road-district. In our opinion the question is settled by the decision in <em>Robert </em>v. <em>Sadler, </em>104 N. Y. 229, 10 N. E. Rep. 428, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>and it would be useless to discuss it. This gravel was not taken for the purpose of reducing the highway to a proper grade, which would seem, by that opinion, to be permissible. It was taken to fill up some inequalities elsewhere, or to improve the road elsewhere. The gravel was plaintiff\u2019s, although the public liad a right of way over it; and this taking of the gravel was not incident to the rights of the public. Judgment affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
