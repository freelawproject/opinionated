Higgins and John J. Morgan from an order denying a motion to continue a temporary injunction restraining defendant, James D. Bell, commissioner of police and excise of the city of Brooklyn, from inspecting plaintiff\u2019s steam-boilers, on the ground that they are exempt from such inspection by virtue of Laws 1874, e. 614; plaintiffs being in possession of guarantied certificates, in full force, of an insurance company organized for the purpose of making guarantied steam-boiler inspections. Laws 1862, c. 168, provided for the inspection of steam-boilers in the fnetropolitan district (of which Brooklyn was a part) by the board of metropolitan police. Laws 1870, e. 136, created a separate police district of Brooklyn, and transferred to the police board thereby created the powers .formerly exercised by the metropolitan police board. Laws 1873, c. 863, provided a charter for the city of Brooklyn, and, <em>inter </em>alia, created a board of police and excise; and by title 11, \u00a7\u00a7 50-52, gave to that board power to inspect steam-boilers in the city. Laws 1874, c. 614, is entitled \u201cAn act to amend an act entitled \u2018An act to-confer additional powers upon the metropolitan police relating to the inspection of steam-boilers,\u2019 passed April 9, 1862; also to amend an act entitled \u2018An act in relation to the inspection of. steam-boilers, except in the metro: politan district,\u2019 passed June 22, 1867.\u201d This act contains no reference to the act of 1873. It provides for the inspection of steam-boilers by certain insurance companies, and that the holders of such' insurance certificates \u201cshall be exempt from any further inspections, and from the pains and penalties of the above-named acts. \u201d</summary>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b122-7\">Argued before Barnard, P.

By well-settled principles the general act of 1874 would not effect a repeal of the special act. Especially is this so, as the scope of the act of 1874 is limited to an amendment of the acts of 1862 and 1867, which were not in force in Brooklyn. It follows that the exemption from police inspection granted by the act of 1874 did not extend to boilers within the city of Brooklyn. They were continually subject to the provisions of the charter of 1873. The act of June 9, 1888, combining all the Brooklyn acts, expressly imposes upon the commissioner of police the duty of inspecting steam-boilers. Were it the intention of .the legislature to exempt from such inspection such boilers as were insured, we must believe they would have found means to express their purpose. The order appealed from must be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
