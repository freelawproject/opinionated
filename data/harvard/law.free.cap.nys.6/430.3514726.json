But the order in this ease permitted a discontinuance absolutely upon payment of motion costs of $10 only. This we think it was not competent for the .county judge to order. This action is one at law to recover money only, where the costs are not discretionary, but are regulated by statute. The order appealed from should be reversed, with costs, leaving the plaintiffs to proceed as they may be advised. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
