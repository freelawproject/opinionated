The order should be affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements.</p>\n<author id=\"b976-16\">Sedgwick, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AST\">In my opinion, the order was correct. Ho specific reason was given for a belief that a trial would have a result different from that of the inquest. Hor on the trial did it appear that what the defendant desired to prove could not have been proven by other witnesses. If there was error in the decision of the judge at the trial the defendant was protected by his right to appeal; otherwise the matter was in the discretion of the trial judge first, and then of the judge who made the order appealed from. In neither case was the discretion improperly used. I think the order should be affirmed, with $10 costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
