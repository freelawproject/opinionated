CARRICO.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This appeal implicates Code \u00a7 19.2-74(A)(1). In pertinent part, this Code section provides that when a police officer detains a person for a Class 1 misdemeanor, the officer \"shall . . . issue a summons . . . to appear at a time and place to be specified in such summons,\" and \"[u]pon the giving by such person of his written promise to appear at such time and place, the officer shall forthwith release him from custody.\" The Code section also contains several exceptions allowing a warrantless arrest pursuant to Code \u00a7 19.2-82 \"if any such person shall fail or refuse to discontinue the unlawful act\" or \"if any person is believed by the arresting officer to be likely to disregard a summons . . . or . . . cause harm to himself or to any other person.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On February 20, 2003, two City of Portsmouth detectives, responding to a radio message that a motorist was operating a motor vehicle on a suspended license, stopped a vehicle being driven by the defendant, David Lee Moore. The officers ascertained that Moore was in fact operating on a suspended license. Although the offense is a Class 1 misdemeanor, Code \u00a7 46.2-301(C), the officers did not issue Moore a summons but arrested him, handcuffed him, and placed him in a police vehicle. They gave him the\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   warnings and secured his signature on a consent to search his room at the hotel where he was staying. They then took him to the hotel room.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Because of a \"miscommunication\" between the officers, they did not search Moore at the time he was arrested. Upon reaching his hotel room, they searched his person and found approximately 16 grams of crack cocaine in his jacket pocket and $516.00 in cash in his pants pocket. He admitted the cocaine was his.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Moore was indicted for possession of cocaine with intent to distribute. Code \u00a7 18.2-248. He then moved to suppress all the evidence obtained in the search of his person,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   asserting that the seizure of the evidence violated the provisions of the Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Amendments to the Constitution of the United States.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The trial court denied the motion to suppress. In a bench trial, the court convicted Moore of possession with intent to distribute cocaine and sentenced him to serve five years in the penitentiary, with one year and six months suspended.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Moore appealed his conviction to the Court of Appeals of Virginia. A divided panel of the court reversed Moore's conviction, finding the search of Moore \"in violation of the Fourth Amendment.\"\n   <em>\n    Moore v. Commonwealth,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1167957\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va-app/45/146/#p155\">\n    45 Va.App. 146\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 155,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1167957\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va-app/45/146/#p155\">\n    609 S.E.2d 74\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 79 (2005). However, upon rehearing en banc, a majority affirmed the conviction, finding that Moore's arrest did not violate his Fourth Amendment rights.\n   <em>\n    Moore v. Commonwealth,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1023957\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va-app/47/55/#p64\">\n    47 Va.App. 55\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 64,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1023957\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va-app/47/55/#p64\">\n    622 S.E.2d 253\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 258 (2005). We awarded Moore this appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On appeal, Moore argues that Code \u00a7 19.2-74 requires that the police issue a summons to a person detained for a Class 1 misdemeanor and to forthwith release him from custody upon his promise to appear at a specified time and place, unless he is subject to one or more of the exceptions listed in the statute. Moore asserts that none of the exceptions apply in this case.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Moore says that\n   \"[w]hen a person is unlawfully detained, as [he] was when he was arrested rather than being given a citation, the fruits of the unlawful detention must be suppressed.\" Moore concludes that the Court of Appeals en banc erred in holding that his \"arrest and search did not violate the Fourth Amendment.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On the other hand, the Commonwealth argues that the search of Moore was valid. The Commonwealth maintains that \"the police officers had probable cause to arrest Moore because he committed a misdemeanor in their presence,\" and the \"search incident to an arrest . . . did not violate the Fourth Amendment.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In support of his position, Moore cites the decision of the Supreme Court of the United States in\n   <em>\n    Knowles v. Iowa,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11076351\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/525/113/\">\n    525 U.S. 113\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11076359,11076351\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/119/484/\">\n    119 S.Ct. 484\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11076351\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/525/113/\">\n    142 L.Ed.2d 492\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1998), and this Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Lovelace v.

In\n   <em>\n    Knowles,\n   </em>\n   an Iowa statute allowed a police officer to arrest a person for a traffic offense and immediately take him before a magistrate or to issue a citation in lieu of arrest. The statute further provided that the issuance of a citation in lieu of arrest \"does not affect the officer's authority to conduct an otherwise lawful search.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11076351\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/525/113/\">\n    525 U.S. at 115\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11076359,11076351\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/119/484/\">\n    119 S.Ct. 484\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citing and quoting\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Iowa%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%20805.1\">\n    Iowa Code Ann. \u00a7 805.1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (4)).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   An Iowa policeman stopped Knowles for speeding and issued him a citation rather than arresting him. The officer then conducted a full search of the vehicle without either Knowles' consent or probable cause, found marijuana and a \"pot pipe,\" and placed Knowles under arrest. Knowles moved to suppress the evidence. The trial court denied the motion and Knowles was found guilty. The Supreme Court of Iowa affirmed, upholding the constitutionality under a bright-line \"search incident to citation\" exception to the Fourth Amendment's warrant requirement.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Iowa%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%20805.1\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Iowa%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%20805.1\">\n    at 115\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11076359,11076351\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/119/484/\">\n    119 S.Ct. 484\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The Supreme Court of the United States reversed. Noting that the officer had issued Knowles a citation rather than arresting him, the Court stated that the \"[t]he question presented is whether such a procedure authorizes the officer, consistently with the Fourth Amendment, to conduct a full search of the car.\" The Court answered the question \"no.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 114,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11076359,11076351\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/119/484/\">\n    119 S.Ct. 484\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The Court explained that in\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The Court noted that the exception was based upon \"two historical rationales for the `search incident to arrest' exception: (1) the need to disarm the suspect in order to take him into custody, and (2) the need to preserve evidence for later use at trial.\"\n   <em>\n    Knowles,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11076351\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/525/113/\">\n    525 U.S. at 116\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11076359,11076351\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/119/484/\">\n    119 S.Ct. 484\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Although asked to do so, the Court declined to extend the bright-line search incident to arrest exception to the Fourth Amendment recognized in\n   <em>\n    Robinson\n   </em>\n   to include a search incident to citation, a situation, the Court concluded, \"where the concern for officer safety is not present to the same extent and the concern for destruction or loss of evidence is not present at all.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 119,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11076359,11076351\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/119/484/\">\n    119 S.Ct. 484\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The Commonwealth argues that\n   <em>\n    Knowles\n   </em>\n   is not dispositive because the defendant there was not arrested and the decision in\n   <em>\n    Knowles\n   </em>\n   \"holds that a search incident to a\n   <em>\n    citation\n   </em>\n   cannot be as expansive under the Fourth Amendment as one incident to an\n   <em>\n    arrest.\n   </em>\n   \" We cannot find such a holding in\n   <em>\n    Knowles.\n   </em>\n   In any event, it is clear that what the Court actually held in\n   <em>\n    Knowles\n   </em>\n   was that the Fourth Amendment forbids expansion of the search incident to arrest exception to include a search incident to citation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 118-19,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11076359,11076351\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/119/484/\">\n    119 S.Ct. 484\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The Commonwealth also argues that the Supreme Court's subsequent decision in\n   <em>\n    Atwater v.

In\n   <em>\n    Atwater,\n   </em>\n   a police officer observed that Gail Atwater was driving her pickup truck with her young son and daughter in the front seat, all without seat belts.

The deputy did not know if it was a plastic bag or what but he felt some lumps and something \"squooshy,\" and he reached into Lovelace's pocket and retrieved the bag. The officer then arrested Lovelace and charged him with possession of marijuana and possession with intent to distribute cocaine, but not with any alcohol-related offense. The substance in the bag was later tested and identified as crack cocaine. The test also identified some marijuana.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 591-92,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=522%20S.E.2d%20856\">\n    522 S.E.2d at 857\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The Commonwealth argued in\n   <em>\n    Lovelace\n   </em>\n   that the officers had probable cause to arrest Lovelace for drinking an alcoholic beverage in public and thus could conduct a search incident to arrest. We disagreed, based on\n   <em>\n    Knowles,\n   </em>\n   and stated as follows:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The encounter between Lovelace and the officers, while not involving a traffic offense, was nonetheless similar in nature and duration to a routine traffic stop. We reach this conclusion primarily because the initial reason for detaining Lovelace was his alleged commission of a Class 4 misdemeanor for which the issuance of a summons was authorized under Code \u00a7 19.2-74(A)(2). Only if Lovelace had failed or refused to discontinue the unlawful act could the officer have effected a custodial arrest and taken the defendant before a magistrate. Code \u00a7 19.2-74(A)(2). However, there is no evidence in the record that Lovelace acted in such a manner.\n   <em>\n    The fact that the officers could have issued only a summons for the alcohol-related offense also negates the Commonwealth's argument that the existence of probable cause to charge Lovelace with drinking an alcoholic beverage in public allowed Womack to search him.\n   </em>\n   After\n   <em>\n    Knowles,\n   </em>\n   an \"arrest\" that is effected by issuing a citation or summons rather than taking the suspect into custody does not, by itself, justify a full field-type search.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 596,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=522%20S.E.2d%20856\">\n    522 S.E.2d at 860\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). We concluded that \"the search of Lovelace was not consistent with the Fourth Amendment,\" and we reversed and dismissed both of Lovelace's convictions.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 597,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=522%20S.E.2d%20856\">\n    522 S.E.2d at 860\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The Commonwealth distinguishes\n   <em>\n    Lovelace\n   </em>\n   by saying that the police officer detained Lovelace to issue a citation and did not arrest him, give him the\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warnings, or inform him he was under arrest while, in Moore's case, he was placed under arrest and thus the officers \"did not exceed their authority when they conducted the search\" of Moore.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   This is a distinction that makes no difference. While Lovelace was not actually arrested until after Officer Womack retrieved the \"squooshy\" bag from his pocket, Womack insisted in his testimony that, initially, he was \"detaining the defendant because of the open containers of beer, the bottle-throwing incident, and the odor of alcohol that he noticed when speaking with Lovelace,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 592,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=522%20S.E.2d%20856\">\n    522 S.E.2d at 857\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , facts indicative of the Class 4 misdemeanor of drinking in public. Code \u00a7 4.1-308. It was the type of offense for which Womack was detaining Lovelace that triggered the operation of Code \u00a7 19.2-74 and permitted Womack to issue only a summons to Lovelace since none of the statute's exceptions were present. Because Womack was authorized to issue only a summons for the alcohol-related offense, he could not lawfully conduct a full field-type search incident to an arrest.\n   <em>\n    Lovelace,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"896551\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va/258/588/\">\n    258 Va. at 596\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=522%20S.E.2d%20856\">\n    522 S.E.2d at 860\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The same conclusion applies to the case at bar. Our statement in\n   <em>\n    Lovelace\n   </em>\n   could have\n   equally been written using Moore and his charged offense: \"The fact that the officers could have issued only a summons for the [driving on suspended license] offense also negates the Commonwealth's argument that the existence of probable cause to charge [Moore] with [driving on suspended license] allowed [the officer] to search him.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=522%20S.E.2d%20856\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The officers were authorized to issue only a summons to Moore for the offense of operating a vehicle on a suspended license since none of the exceptions in Code \u00a7 19.2-74 were present. Thus, under the holding in\n   <em>\n    Knowles,\n   </em>\n   the officers could not lawfully conduct a full field-type search. We find\n   <em>\n    Knowles\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Lovelace\n   </em>\n   controlling and hold that the search of Moore was not consistent with the Fourth Amendment. Accordingly, we will reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and dismiss the indictment against Moore.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <em>\n    Reversed and dismissed.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1.\">\n   <p id=\"p-41\">\n    <em>\n     Miranda v.
