Fox &amp; Associates, P.C., we reverse the trial court's grant of summary judgment as to Plaintiff's indemnity claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   We further find that a genuine issue of material fact remains as to whether Fox &amp; Associates did, in fact, breach its contract with Schenkel &amp; Shultz, and also reverse as to Fox &amp; Associates's counterclaim. However, because we conclude that Schenkel &amp; Shultz knew or should have known of its injury more than three years before filing its direct claims of negligence and professional malpractice, breach of contract, and breach of warranty, we affirm the trial court's grant of summary judgment in favor of Fox &amp; Associates on those claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On 24 November 1998, the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education (\"the school board\") contracted with Schenkel &amp; Shultz to design a new vocational high school. The contract required Schenkel &amp; Shultz to retain outside consultants or engineers to prepare certain portions of the work, if Schenkel &amp; Shultz did not possess the in-house expertise necessary for the task. In April 1999, Schenkel &amp; Shultz contracted with Fox &amp; Associates to provide structural steel design for the school. Drawings prepared by Fox &amp; Associates were incorporated into the final construction plans submitted to the school board, and construction commenced in the fall of 2000.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In the spring of 2001, contractors, subcontractors, and other consultants began to question the adequacy of the structural steel design prepared by Fox &amp; Associates, who, after being notified of the issues, reviewed its design and determined certain errors had occurred. Thereafter, Fox &amp; Associates prepared and submitted remedial designs, which required additional work by the steel fabricators and erectors on-site to correct the errors. As a result, several multi-prime contractors incurred increased costs and invoiced the school board for payments exceeding three million dollars.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On 3 October 2001, the school board sent Schenkel &amp; Shultz a letter stating that Schenkel &amp; Shultz would be \"held responsible for the cost of corrective work along with the cost required to accelerate the schedule due to delays caused by the corrective work.\" The following day, Schenkel &amp; Shultz notified Fox &amp; Associates by letter that it would \"look to [Fox &amp; Associates] and [its] insurance carrier for full restitution of this cost.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On 5 February 2002, Schenkel &amp; Shultz sent Fox &amp; Associates another letter asserting that it intended to hold Fox &amp; Associates liable for any damages associated with deficiencies in the structural steel design. Additionally, Schenkel &amp; Shultz maintained that, \"Pursuant to the . . . agreement between [Schenkel &amp; Shultz and Fox &amp; Associates] . . ., [Schenkel &amp; Shultz] hereby demands that [Fox &amp; Associates] defend, indemnify and hold harmless [Schenkel &amp; Shultz] in connection with any such claims.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   After failed mutual attempts to resolve the matter out of court, Schenkel &amp; Shultz brought an action against Fox &amp; Associates on 1 October 2004, alleging negligence and professional malpractice, breach of contract, breach of warranty, and indemnification. In response, Fox &amp; Associates moved to dismiss and counterclaimed for breach of contract due to failure to pay, and thereafter moved for judgment on the pleadings. The school board, in turn, brought an action against Schenkel &amp; Shultz for negligence and professional malpractice, breach of contract, and breach of warranty, on 29 December 2004.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On 25 February 2005, after converting Fox &amp; Associates's motion to dismiss to a motion for summary judgment, the trial court granted summary judgment to Fox &amp; Associates and dismissed with prejudice Schenkel &amp; Shultz's direct claims for negligence and professional malpractice, breach of contract, and breach of warranty, finding that such claims were barred by the statutes of limitations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Thereafter, Fox &amp; Associates moved for summary judgment as to Schenkel &amp; Shultz's remaining claim for indemnification and its own counterclaim for breach of contract. On 9 August 2005, the trial court granted Fox &amp; Associates's motion as to both claims and ordered Schenkel &amp; Shultz to pay Fox &amp; Associates the contractual amount.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Schenkel &amp; Shultz now appeals both orders of summary judgment, arguing that the trial courts erred by (I) dismissing its direct contract, tort, and warranty claims on the basis of the statutes of limitations; (II) granting summary judgment to Fox &amp; Associates on the claim for indemnification; and, (III) granting summary judgment to Fox &amp; Associates on its counterclaim for breach of contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Schenkel &amp; Shultz first argues the trial court erred by holding that the applicable statutes of limitations barred its direct claims under contract, tort, and warranty. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Claims of breach of contract, negligence and professional malpractice, and breach of warranty are all governed by a three-year statute of limitations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   N.C.

Schenkel &amp; Shultz points to its complaint, filed 1 October 2004, which asserts that the school board notified Schenkel &amp; Shultz of its belief that there were numerous problems with the structural steel design of the project \"[b]eginning in October 2001.\" However, in the 25 February 2005 order granting summary judgment, the trial court found that\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   [I]t has been established by uncontroverted evidence that [Schenkel &amp; Shultz] had actual notice and/or reason to know of its claims arising out of any alleged negligence and professional malpractice, breach of contract and breach of warranty by [Fox &amp; Associates] in connection with the structural steel design on the Project no later than August 9, 2001, a date more than\n   three years prior to the filing of Plaintiff's complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   This finding was based on the trial court's \"consideration of the pleadings, exhibits thereto, the Affidavit in Opposition to Motion for Judgment of the Pleadings filed by [Schenkel &amp; Shultz] and the attachments thereto, and the arguments of counsel.\" Included in those documents was an 8 May 2001 letter from Schenkel &amp; Shultz to the construction project manager, \"acknowledg[ing] receipt of your letter dated May 3, 2001 regarding concerns raised by your structural steel subcontractor about the integrity of the structural steel design on this project\" and noting that Fox &amp; Associates had \"decided to re-examine their complete structural steel design on this project.\" Additionally, the record contains a letter from the project manager to Schenkel &amp; Shultz, dated 9 August 2001, notifying Schenkel &amp; Shultz of problems with the structural steel design in a specific part of the school being constructed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Nonetheless, Schenkel &amp; Shultz contends that the causes of action began to accrue not when the design was negligently provided or when it was informed of the potential steel design problems, but when it was actually harmed by Fox &amp; Associates's conduct. Thus, Schenkel &amp; Shultz asserts that the accrual began in October 2001, when the school board first notified Schenkel &amp; Shultz that it would be held responsible for the cost overruns and delays, and Fox &amp; Associates declined to indemnify Schenkel &amp; Shultz for the damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In a similar action against an architect for negligence arising out of a construction project, this Court held that the \"date of the accrual of a cause of action is deemed to be the date of discovery of the defective or unsafe condition of a structure, and . . . the action must be brought within three years thereafter.\"\n   <em>\n    Quail Hollow East Condominium Ass'n v.

Moreover, the \"discovery rule,\" which sometimes operates to extend the statute of limitations, is intended to apply in situations where the injury becomes apparent only after some delay, or the claimant might be somehow prevented from realizing the injury.\n   <em>\n    See Black v.

The 8 May 2001 and 9 August 2001 letters fall outside of the three-year statutes of limitations for the direct claims alleged in its complaint filed on 1 October 2004. The letters indicate that Schenkel &amp; Shultz knew or had reason to know of the harm done to the project and the resulting breach of the underlying contract and warranty. Such knowledge would begin the accrual of the three-year statutes of limitations for Schenkel &amp; Shultz's direct claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Accordingly, we find that no genuine issue of material fact remains as to whether Schenkel &amp; Shultz's direct claims were barred by the statutes of limitations.

Although the\n   <em>\n    Premier\n   </em>\n   case involved the sale of securities, the facts are analogous to the instant case: the plaintiff brought an action for indemnity based on an express contractual claim, but not until four years after the underlying breach of contract, and, in fact, after the contract had actually expired. The Fourth Circuit held that the indemnity claim was not barred by the statute of limitations because the payment for which the plaintiff sought indemnity was made several months prior to the claim being filed, although more than three years after the breach of contract.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"870449\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/578/551/#p553\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Thus, the actual loss was suffered within the three-year period.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Here, Schenkel &amp; Shultz filed its claim for indemnity before the school board instituted its action against Schenkel &amp; Shultz for costs and damages incurred as a result of steel design errors. That action is still pending in federal court. Thus, the statute of limitations has not yet tolled against Schenkel &amp; Shultz for its claim for indemnity against Fox &amp; Associates.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Though we find an issue of fact exists regarding Schenkel &amp; Shultz's claim for express contract indemnity, we reject Schenkel &amp; Shultz's contentions for indemnity under the theories of contract implied-in-fact and contract implied-in-law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   As to a contract implied-in-fact, to determine if a right to indemnity exists, \"we look to [the parties'] relationship and its surrounding circumstances.\"\n   <em>\n    Kaleel,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8955161\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc-app/161/34/#p44\">\n    161 N.C.App. at 40\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=587%20S.E.2d%20470\">\n    587 S.E.2d at 475\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In the context of independent contractor relationships, a right of indemnity under a contract implied-in-fact is inappropriate where, as here, both parties are well equipped to negotiate and bargain for such provisions.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=587%20S.E.2d%20470\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Accordingly, in light of the ability and capacity of parties to construction contracts to negotiate and bargain for mutually agreeable terms, we decline to read a right of indemnity implied-in-fact into the independent contractor agreement in this case.

Thus, to successfully assert a right to indemnity based on a contract implied-in-law, a party must be able to prove each of the elements of an underlying tort such as negligence. Moreover, expert witness testimony would be necessary to prove a right to indemnity grounded in an underlying claim of negligence, i.e., one that arises from a contract implied-in-law. To prove negligence, Schenkel &amp; Shultz would be required to show that Fox &amp; Associates had breached the professional standard of care, which would almost certainly necessitate expert witness testimony.\n   <em>\n    See Associated Indus.

Fox &amp; Associates's counterclaim alleged Schenkel &amp; Shultz breached the contract by failing to pay Fox &amp; Associates the money due for services performed pursuant to the contract. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of Fox &amp; Associates, awarding the company $37,787.50. We agree with Schenkel &amp; Shultz and accordingly reverse the trial court's order on this issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   \"The general rule governing bilateral contracts provides that if either party to the contract is materially in default with respect to performance of his obligations under the contract, the other party should be excused from the obligation to perform further.\"\n   <em>\n    Paul B.

N.C. R.App. 10(a) (2006); N.C. R.App. 28(a) (2006). Plaintiff failed to\n   set forth any argument in its appellate brief to excuse its failure to designate an expert witness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Plaintiff's brief only addresses three of the four grounds defendant argued to grant summary judgment. Plaintiff's failure to designate an expert witness supports the trial court's grant of summary judgment in favor of defendant. Plaintiff's assignment of error is not preserved or is abandoned and should be dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   <em>\n    II. Lack of an Expert Witness\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   The majority's opinion holds a genuine issue of material fact exists whether the contract between plaintiff and the school board provided for the indemnification of plaintiff by defendant by incorporation-by-reference and the flow-through contractual provision. Presuming an \"indemnity\" provision exists in these contracts, summary judgment is still proper and the trial court's judgment should be affirmed. No indemnity provision exists in the contract between plaintiff and defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   The \"indemnity\" provision plaintiff relies upon states:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   In the event a claim, suit, or cause of action is made against [the school board] and/or [the school boards'] representatives for any personal injury, including death, or property damage (other than to the work itself), or other loss or damage\n   <em>\n    resulting solely from any negligent act or omission of the [plaintiff] or out of [plaintiff's] breach of this Agreement,\n   </em>\n   [plaintiff] agrees to defend and hold [the school board] ... harmless and indemnified from any loss, costs, damages, expenses, attorneys fees and liability with respect to such claim, suit, or cause of action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   (Emphasis supplied). Even if this \"indemnity\" provision requires defendant to indemnify plaintiff, plaintiff cannot establish negligence liability as a matter of law without expert testimony to establish defendant's professional standard of care and breach thereof.\n   <em>\n    See Handex of the Carolinas, Inc. v.

If defendant's duty to indemnify arises \"out of [plaintiff's] breach of the Agreement,\" with the school board, expert testimony is required to establish the breach.

Contractual Indemnity\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   The majority's opinion holds the trial court's order granting defendant's motion for summary judgment regarding plaintiff's indemnification claim should be reversed because a genuine issue of material fact remains as to whether the contract between plaintiff and defendant expressly provided for indemnification. I disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Plaintiff argues that defendant is contractually bound to indemnify it because plaintiff had contractually agreed to indemnify the school board. As noted earlier, the contract between plaintiff and the school board provides, in part, that:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   In the event a claim, suit, or cause of action is made against [the school board] and/or [the school boards'] representatives for any personal injury, including death, or property damage (other than to the work itself), or other loss or damage resulting solely from any negligent act or omission of the [plaintiff] or out of [plaintiff's] breach of this Agreement, [plaintiff] agrees to defend and hold [the school board] ... harmless and indemnified from any loss, costs, damages, expenses, attorneys fees and liability with respect to such claim, suit, or cause of action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   The contract between plaintiff and defendant does not include this covenant or any express contractual provision for defendant to indemnify plaintiff. Plaintiff relies on Section 1.1.2\n   of its contract with defendant to argue the above language was \"incorporated by reference\" or implied into its contract with defendant. Section 1.1.2 of the contract between plaintiff and defendant provides:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   [Defendant's] services shall be performed according to this Agreement with [plaintiff] in the same manner and to the same extent that [plaintiff] is bound by the attached Prime Agreement to perform such services for [the school board]. Except as set forth herein, [defendant] shall not have any duties or responsibilities for any other part of the project.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Plaintiff drafted the contract with defendant and failed to reference, include, or bargain for any indemnification by defendant.\n   <em>\n    See Silvers v.
