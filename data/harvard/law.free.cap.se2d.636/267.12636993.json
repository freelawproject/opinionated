We determine there was no error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    FACTS\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On 12 July 2004, defendant was indicted for three counts of statutory sexual offense and three counts of taking indecent liberties with a minor. The case was tried at the 11 July 2005 Criminal Session of Ashe County Superior Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The State presented evidence at trial which tended to show the following: K.S. is the daughter of defendant. K.S. and defendant had a good relationship until conflict arose between them regarding K.S.'s relationship with her boyfriend. After that, defendant began abusing K.S., and the abuse\n   usually occurred on Saturdays when K.S.'s mother was not at home.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   K.S. testified to multiple incidents of abuse by defendant. The first incident occurred when defendant came into K.S.'s bedroom while K.S. was using her computer. Defendant came up behind K.S., put his hand in her pants, and inserted his fingers inside her. K.S. stated that she fell off the chair and told defendant to \"stop.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The next incident took place while K.S. was driving a car and defendant was riding in the car. Defendant ran his hand up K.S.'s leg and tried to get into her pants, but K.S. leaned against the steering wheel to not allow defendant to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   K.S. also testified about another incident that occurred in her bedroom. Defendant entered K.S.'s bedroom while she was using the computer. Defendant sat on her bed and asked her if she knew how to put on a condom. Defendant demonstrated how to put on a condom, exposing his erect penis to K.S. as he did so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Another incident occurred in the bathroom. Defendant entered the bathroom when K.S. was getting ready to take a shower. Defendant tried to show K.S. his \"private part,\" and K.S. stabbed defendant with tweezers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   K.S. testified to a fifth incident that took place in her parent's bedroom. K.S. went into their bedroom to get batteries. Defendant pushed her down on the bed, said something sexual to her, and tried to take her pants off. K.S. told defendant she had her period and he stopped.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   K.S. told the former minister of her family's church that defendant had touched her in a sexual manner. The minister referred K.S. to social services.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Detective Carolyn Gentry of the Ashe County Sheriff's Department received calls expressing concern that K.S. was being sexually abused by defendant and had also been beaten. As a result, Detective Gentry went to K.S.'s school on 19 February 2004 to check on her. K.S. described to Detective Gentry defendant's sexual abuse of her. K.S. then described to Angie Allen, a DSS child protective services worker, defendant's sexual abuse of her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Detective Gentry asked defendant and his wife to come to the Sheriff's Department on 20 February 2004. They agreed and drove there in their own car. Detective Gentry talked to defendant's wife first, and then talked to defendant. Ms. Allen was also present. Defendant admitted he put his fingers in K.S.'s vagina. Defendant said he did so to check \"if she had any semen in there.\" Defendant said he could not remember how many times he \"fingered\" K.S., but he thought it was at least three times. Ms. Allen stated that defendant admitted he tried to show K.S. how to use a condom.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Ms. Allen asked defendant to go to the DSS office to formulate a protective services plan for K.S. Defendant left the Sheriff's Department and went to the DSS office. At the DSS office, Ms. Allen asked defendant if he had ever said anything sexual to K.S. Defendant said he might have said some things to explain to K.S. the types of things boys would say to get to her. Then DSS took custody of K.S.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Defendant testified at trial as follows: Defendant denied that he sexually abused or attempted to sexually abuse K.S. Defendant said he had talked to K.S. about the importance of using condoms and had taken K.S. and a friend to buy condoms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Defendant said that after he caught K.S. in bed with her boyfriend on 12 February 2004, K.S. begged him to \"check her\" himself rather than taking her to the hospital for an examination. K.S. pulled down her pajama bottoms, laid on the bed, and spread her legs so that he could see her vagina and check to see if she had sex with her boyfriend. Defendant \"checked\" K.S. again about 30 minutes later that same night. K.S. again pulled down her pajama bottoms, laid on the bed, and spread her legs so defendant could view her vagina.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <em>\n    I.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Defendant contends that he was not convicted by a unanimous verdict of the jury because neither the verdict sheets nor the jury instructions identified the specific incidents\n   of the respective charges for which the jury found defendant guilty. Defendant argues that he was not found guilty by a unanimous jury because there was testimony regarding more incidents of sexual misconduct than there were individual charges. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The Constitution of North Carolina states that \"[n]o person shall be convicted of any crime but by the unanimous verdict of a jury in open court.\" N.C. Const. art. I, \u00a7 24. Defendant cites our Court's opinion in\n   <em>\n    State v. Lawrence,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8999162\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc-app/165/548/\">\n    165 N.C.App. 548\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=599%20S.E.2d%2087\">\n    599 S.E.2d 87\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2004), in support of his contention, but that opinion was recently reversed by our Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    State v.

In\n   <em>\n    Lawrence,\n   </em>\n   the jury returned guilty verdicts for, among other things, three counts of taking indecent liberties with a minor and five counts of statutory rape.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 369,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12635399\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/se2d/627/609/\">\n    627 S.E.2d at 609\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Regarding the counts of indecent liberties, our Supreme Court stated \"a defendant may be unanimously convicted of indecent liberties even if: (1) the jurors considered a higher number of incidents of immoral or indecent behavior than the number of counts charged, and (2) the indictments lacked specific details to identify the specific incidents.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 375,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12635399\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/se2d/627/609/\">\n    627 S.E.2d at 613\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Regarding the counts of first-degree statutory rape, our Supreme Court concluded that the defendant was unanimously convicted by the jury even though the victim testified that she had sexual intercourse with the defendant thirty-two separate times.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 375-76,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12635399\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/se2d/627/609/\">\n    627 S.E.2d at 613\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court noted that the evidence at trial tended to show the specific instances of conduct in question at trial.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 375,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12635399\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/se2d/627/609/\">\n    627 S.E.2d at 613\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court also noted:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   (1) defendant never raised an objection at trial regarding unanimity; (2) the jury was instructed on all issues, including unanimity; (3) separate verdict sheets were submitted to the jury for each charge; (4) the jury deliberated and reached a decision on all counts submitted to it in less than one and one-half hours; (5) the record reflected no confusion or questions as to jurors' duty in the trial; and (6) when polled by the court, all jurors individually affirmed that they had found defendant guilty in each individual case file number.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 376,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12635399\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/se2d/627/609/\">\n    627 S.E.2d at 613\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In the instant case, the jury heard testimony from multiple witnesses regarding, at a minimum, five alleged sexual incidents between defendant and K.S. The charges against defendant were based on three of those incidents. We see no merit in defendant's argument that he was not found guilty by a unanimous jury; the jury instructions and verdict sheets were clear as to what incident corresponded to a particular charge. The verdict sheets specifically designated which incident corresponded to each charge. One verdict sheet stated that it related \"to the alleged incident at the computer.\" Another verdict sheet stated it related \"to the alleged incident in the car.\" The last verdict sheet stated that it related \"to the alleged incident in the defendant's bedroom.\" Moreover, the trial judge was clear in the jury instructions which specific incident corresponded to a particular charge and that the jury must be unanimous in reaching its verdict regarding each charge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Therefore, we disagree with defendant's contention.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <em>\n    II.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Defendant contends the trial court erred in allowing the State's motion to amend the dates alleged on each indictment. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The North Carolina General Statutes provide that \"[a] bill of indictment may not be amended.\" N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 15A-923(e) (2005). Our Supreme Court adopted this Court's interpretation of \"amendment\" in this context to mean \"`any change in the indictment which would substantially alter the charge set forth in the indictment.'\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

Gen.Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 14-27.7A(a) and 14-202.1 (2005). The statute for statutory sexual offense states:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   A defendant is guilty of a Class B1 felony if the defendant engages in vaginal intercourse or a sexual act with another person who is 13, 14, or 15 years old and the defendant is at least six years older than the person, except when the defendant is lawfully married to the person.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 14-27.7A(a). Regarding the charges based on this statute, the indictments stated \"the defendant named above ... engage[d] in a sexual act with ... a person of the age of 15 years. At the time of the offense, the defendant was at least six years older than the victim and was not lawfully married to the victim.\" Therefore, regarding the charge of statutory sexual offense, the language of the indictments is couched in the language of the statute, and we determine there is no error in the indictment regarding this charge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The statute for taking indecent liberties with a child states:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   A person is guilty of taking indecent liberties with children if, being 16 years of age or more and at least five years older than the child in question, he either:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   (1) Willfully takes or attempts to take any immoral, improper, or indecent liberties with any child of either sex under the age of 16 years for the purpose of arousing or gratifying sexual desire[.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   N.C.

Therefore, defendant's assignment of error challenging the sufficiency of the evidence to support his statutory sexual offense conviction has been abandoned.

We believe the evidence was sufficient to support these elements. This conviction was connected with the incident that occurred in the car. A review of the record shows that there was evidence that defendant was at least 16 years of age, that he was five years older than K.S., and that K.S. was under 16 years of age at the time the alleged act or attempted act occurred. We determine that there was sufficient evidence to support the other elements of the statute. K.S. testified that when she and defendant were alone in the car, defendant ran his hand up her leg and tried to get his hand in her pants, but that defendant was unable to because K.S. leaned up against the steering wheel. This evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the State, is sufficient to show defendant attempted to take an indecent liberty with K.S. for the purpose of arousing or gratifying his sexual desire.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   In order to convict a defendant for attempted statutory sexual offense under N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 14-27.7A(a), the State must prove the defendant engaged in \"a sexual act with another person who is 13, 14, or 15 years old and the defendant is at least six years older than the person, except when the defendant is lawfully married to the person.\" N.C.

In order to meet this burden defendant must satisfy a two-part test:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   \"First, the defendant must show that counsel's performance was deficient. This requires showing that counsel made errors so serious that counsel was not functioning as the 'counsel' guaranteed the defendant by the Sixth Amendment. Second, the defendant must show that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense. This requires showing that counsel's errors were so serious as to deprive the defendant of a fair trial,\n   <em>\n    a trial whose result is reliable.\n   </em>\n   (Emphasis added).\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   <em>\n    Braswell,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4753359\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc/312/553/#p561\">\n    312 N.C. at 562\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=324%20S.E.2d%20241\">\n    324 S.E.2d at 248\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation omitted). \"Thus, if a reviewing court can determine at the outset that there is no reasonable probability that in the absence of counsel's alleged errors the result of the proceeding would have been different, then the court need not determine whether counsel's performance was actually deficient.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 563,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=324%20S.E.2d%20241\">\n    324 S.E.2d at 249\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   In the instant case, defendant asserts it was ineffective assistance of counsel (1) not to request complete recordation of the entire trial and (2) not to object to defendant's statement to law enforcement authorities at trial after moving to suppress the statement prior to trial. After examining the record we conclude that there is no reasonable probability that the alleged errors of defendant's counsel affected the outcome of the trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Regarding the recordation of the trial, defendant asserts that since trial counsel did\n   not ask the trial court to record the opening and closing arguments and the bench conferences, plus a portion of the jury selection, defendant is at a disadvantage with his appeal. Our Supreme Court has held that trial counsel is not ineffective by not requesting recordation of jury selection, bench conferences, opening statements, and closing arguments.\n   <em>\n    State v. Hardison,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5308210\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc/326/646/#p660\">\n    326 N.C. 646\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 660-62,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=392%20S.E.2d%20364\">\n    392 S.E.2d 364\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 372-73 (1990). The defendant's argument in\n   <em>\n    Hardison\n   </em>\n   was very similar to defendant's argument in the instant case, and our Supreme Court stated the argument falls far short of the standard a defendant must meet for an ineffective assistance of counsel argument.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 662,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=392%20S.E.2d%20364\">\n    392 S.E.2d at 373\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Further, defendant's brief on this issue states \"the present state of the law does not support this argument[.]\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Defendant has also not shown his trial counsel was ineffective by not objecting at trial to the admission of defendant's statements to the police, after counsel had earlier filed a pretrial motion to suppress the statements. As we stated above, Rule of Evidence 103(a)(2) was presumed constitutional at the time of the trial, and thus, defendant's trial counsel's decision not to object was a reasonable decision. Moreover, as we discussed above, the trial court properly denied defendant's motion to suppress because defendant was not in custody for\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   purposes and defendant's statements were voluntary. Therefore, we disagree with defendant's contentions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Accordingly, we find no error by the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   No error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   Judges WYNN and McGEE concur.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
