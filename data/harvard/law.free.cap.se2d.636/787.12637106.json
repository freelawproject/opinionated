Because we hold that the district court could not exercise subject matter jurisdiction here in the absence of the verification, we conclude that the trial court's order was void ab initio. Accordingly, we affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals vacating the custody review order and dismissing the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On 22 August 2003, petitioner Wilkes County Department of Social Services (WCDSS) filed a juvenile petition alleging that respondent-mother's daughter, T.R.P., was a neglected juvenile. When the petition was filed, T.R.P. had been living for approximately four months with her maternal aunt, with whom respondent had placed her. The petition alleged that respondent and her boyfriend were manufacturing methamphetamine in respondent's home and that respondent had not cooperated with WCDSS in establishing a safety plan for her children.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Although the juvenile petition setting forth these allegations was notarized, it was neither signed nor verified by the Director of WCDSS or any authorized representative thereof.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In an order signed 6 November 2003, the trial court granted temporary legal and physical custody of T.R.P. and her siblings to WCDSS. After several hearings, the trial court on 15 March 2004 signed an order adjudicating T.R.P. and her siblings as neglected and continuing custody of the children with WCDSS. On 24 May 2004, the trial court held a custody review hearing as required by N.C.G.S. \u00a7 7B-906(a). The trial court's resulting order, announced in open court and later filed on 16 June 2004, continued legal custody of T.R.P. with WCDSS and, although the trial court found respondent had \"been cooperative with [WCDSS] since the initial adjudication,\" placed T.R.P. in her father's physical custody when school began, provided he met several specified conditions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On 3 June 2004, respondent gave written notice of appeal of the custody review order to the Court of Appeals. In her brief to that court, respondent contended for the first time that the trial court lacked jurisdiction to enter the challenged review order because the juvenile petition was not verified as required by law. In a divided opinion, the Court of Appeals vacated the custody review order and dismissed the case, holding that the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the action.\n   <em>\n    In re T.R.P.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8353953\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc-app/173/541/\">\n    173 N.C.App. 541\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12633985\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/se2d/619/525/\">\n    619 S.E.2d 525\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2005).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On 8 November 2005, petitioner filed notice of appeal with this Court based on the dissenting opinion in the Court of Appeals. Petitioner contends that because respondent failed to challenge the trial court's subject matter jurisdiction before appealing the custody review order, she is barred from presenting that issue in the instant appeal. Petitioner also argues that under N.C.G.S. \u00a7 7B-906, the trial court had jurisdiction to conduct a review hearing that was independent of its jurisdiction to hear the original juvenile petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Jurisdiction is \"[t]he legal power and authority of a court to make a decision that binds the parties to any matter properly brought before it.\"\n   <em>\n    Black's Law Dictionary\n   </em>\n   856 (7th ed.1999) (defining \"judicial jurisdiction\").

Therefore, given the magnitude of the interests at stake in juvenile cases and the potentially devastating consequences of any errors, the General Assembly's requirement of a verified petition is a reasonable method of assuring that our courts exercise their power only when an identifiable government actor \"vouches\" for the validity of the allegations in such a freighted action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Petitioner nevertheless argues that, even in the absence of a verified petition, the trial court had subject matter jurisdiction over the instant proceeding pursuant to section 7B-906, which authorizes a review hearing within ninety days and again within six months \"[i]n any case where custody is removed from a parent, guardian, custodian, or caretaker.\" N.C.G.S. \u00a7 7B-906(a) (2005). This statute further states that \"[t]he director of social services shall make a timely request to the clerk to calendar each review. . . .

Not only did the General Assembly provide that a properly verified juvenile petition would invoke the jurisdiction of the trial court, it further provided that jurisdiction would extend through all subsequent stages of the action.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   N.C.G.S. \u00a7 7B-201(a) (2005) (\"[J]urisdiction shall continue until terminated by order of the court or until the juvenile reaches the age of 18 years or is otherwise emancipated. . . .\"). Chapter 7B sets out a sequential process for abuse, neglect, or dependency cases, wherein each required action or event must occur within a prescribed amount of time after the preceding stage in\n   the case. For example, \"[t]he adjudicatory hearing shall be held . . . no later than 60 days from the filing of the petition,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413198\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/57/#p65\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 7B-801(c) (2005), and \"[t]he dispositional hearing shall take place immediately following the adjudicatory hearing,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413198\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/57/#p65\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 7B-901 (2005). Similarly, a custody review hearing under section 7B-906 \"shall [be] conduct[ed] . . . within 90 days from the date of the dispositional hearing,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413198\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/57/#p65\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 7B-906(a), and the resulting \"order must be reduced to writing, signed, and entered within 30 days of the completion of the hearing,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413198\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/57/#p65\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 7B-906(d) (2005). Thus, a custody review hearing is mandatory only after a dispositional hearing, which, in turn, must be preceded by the filing of a petition and an adjudication.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Because the provisions in Chapter 7B establish one continuous juvenile case with several interrelated stages, not a series of discrete proceedings, we are unpersuaded by petitioner's assertion that the trial court had subject matter jurisdiction over the custody review hearing regardless of whether the original petition invoked the court's jurisdiction over the juvenile proceeding. A trial court's subject matter jurisdiction over all stages of a juvenile case is established when the action is initiated with the filing of a properly verified petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Petitioner and the dissenters further contend that allowing a litigant to raise a jurisdictional challenge in a juvenile action long after the proceeding is commenced could disrupt an established program of placement. We must acknowledge that such a strategy is possible in any case where a court lacks subject matter jurisdiction. Nevertheless, we believe the unambiguous statutory language mandates our holding. Faced with similar language pertaining to divorce proceedings,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   N.C.G.S. \u00a7 50-8 (2005) (\"In all actions for divorce the complaint shall be verified in accordance with the provisions of Rule 11 of the Rules of Civil Procedure and G.S. 1-148.\"), we have held that the trial court did not have jurisdiction in the absence of a verified complaint,\n   <em>\n    Hodges v.

We do not discount this concern, but believe that it is speculative and can be resolved by the trial court and the parties.

Although a social history included in the record indicates that T.R.P. had been placed by her mother with an aunt prior to the filing of the petition in this case, the record is unclear as to T.R.P.'s legal custody at the time the instant petition was filed.

The interpretation urged by petitioner and by the dissenters would upset this balance by allowing a child to be taken from its parents even in the absence of a sworn verification by a Department of Social Services official that the allegations in the petition are true. The statutory requirement for verification of juvenile\n   petitions is a minimally burdensome limitation on government action, designed to ensure that a department of social services intervention that has the potential to disrupt family bonds is based upon valid and substantive allegations before the court's jurisdiction is invoked.

Put simply, did the legislature intend to jeopardize the well-being of a child due to a clerical error by a Department of Social Services (\"DSS\") employee? The majority determines the legislature crafted N.C.G.S. \u00a7 7B-403 with a view towards making a trial court's subject matter jurisdiction in such proceedings contingent on verification of the juvenile petition. This conclusion cannot be reconciled with the principles the General Assembly has directed should govern interpretations of the Juvenile Code, and it is not compelled by our case law addressing the relationship between verification requirements and subject matter jurisdiction. The majority's preference for form over substance in juvenile proceedings threatens to introduce additional instability into the lives of at-risk children. Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Before April 2003 respondent-mother obtained temporary custody of T.R.P. and a protective order against T.R.P.'s father. Along with her three minor children, respondent-mother was living at the home of her new boyfriend when police discovered a methamphetamine laboratory there on 21 April 2003. Respondent-mother was charged with child endangerment and felony drug offenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Wilkes County Department of Social Services (\"WCDSS\") intervened at the request of the police and determined the laboratory created a dangerous situation for the three children. Respondent-mother complied with WCDSS's suggestion that her two sons be placed with their father and that T.R.P. be placed with respondent-mother's sister. By 22 August 2003, the voluntary nature of the placement and respondent-mother's refusal to sign and comply with the family service case plan made it necessary for WCDSS to file a petition alleging T.R.P. to be a neglected juvenile. Although the petition identified the petitioner and properly stated the factual allegations of neglect, the WCDSS director failed to sign and verify the petition. WCDSS took no affirmative action when it filed the petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Following a hearing on 15 September 2003, the trial court granted temporary legal and physical custody to WCDSS, but continued the adjudication because T.R.P.'s father was in a drug rehabilitation facility and could not be present. Hearings occurred on 16 and 23 February 2004 in which WCDSS presented evidence substantiating the allegations in the petition. The trial court, after finding it had subject matter jurisdiction and WCDSS had shown neglect by clear and convincing evidence, ordered physical and legal custody of T.R.P. to remain with WCDSS. Respondent-mother did not appeal the trial court's decision. T.R.P. continued to reside with her aunt throughout this process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   At a statutorily required custody review hearing on 24 May 2004, the court again received testimony concerning the best interest of T.R.P. It ordered continued legal and physical custody of T.R.P. with WCDSS and future placement, supervised by WCDSS, with T.R.P.'s father. Objecting to the placement\n   of T.R.P. with her father, respondent-mother appealed. For the first time, she argued the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction because the petition was not verified.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The majority concludes the General Assembly intended the verification requirement of N.C.G.S. \u00a7 7B-403(a) to be jurisdictional and affirms the Court of Appeals decision vacating the custody review order and dismissing the case because the juvenile petition was not verified. However, this result is not required by the Juvenile Code; indeed, such a reading contradicts the directives of the General Assembly.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   In matters of statutory construction, our task is to determine the intent of the General Assembly.\n   <em>\n    Person v.

Containing two sections, Article 2 (\"Jurisdiction\") specifies the jurisdictional parameters of the courts to consider allegations of juvenile abuse, neglect, and dependency. The first section grants district courts \"exclusive, original jurisdiction over any case involving a juvenile who is alleged to be abused, neglected, or dependent.\" N.C.G.S. \u00a7 7B-200(a) (2005). The second\n   section provides, \"When the court obtains jurisdiction over a juvenile, jurisdiction shall continue until terminated by order of the court or until the juvenile reaches the age of 18 years or is otherwise emancipated.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12633155\" index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/se2d/614/489/#p491\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 7B-201(a) (2005). Significantly, no provision of Article 2 makes jurisdiction contingent upon verification of the petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   We must assume the General Assembly understands the fundamental concepts of jurisdiction and subject matter jurisdiction cited by the majority. Therefore, when the legislature expressly dedicates part of a statutory scheme to jurisdiction, the courts should resist creating jurisdictional requirements elsewhere. The General Assembly could have included a verification requirement in the \"Jurisdiction\" Article. Instead, consistent with the purposes enumerated in Article 1, the General Assembly chose to provide district courts with broad subject matter jurisdiction over any matter in which a juvenile is \"alleged to be abused, neglected, or dependent.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12633155\" index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/se2d/614/489/#p491\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 7B-200(a). The majority's imposition of an additional jurisdictional requirement undermines the comprehensive statutory scheme the legislature designed to protect at-risk children. Since a party may raise a trial court's want of subject matter jurisdiction at any time, our Court should be reluctant to declare a provision jurisdictional unless the plain language of the statute compels such a conclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   The verification requirement of N.C.G.S. \u00a7 7B-403, on which the majority relies, does not appear in Subchapter I until Article 4 (\"Venue; Petitions\"). Article 4 nowhere indicates that any of its elements are jurisdictional in nature. Rather, N.C.G.S. \u00a7 7B-402 specifies certain requirements of a petition:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   The petition shall contain the name, date of birth, address of the juvenile, the name and last known address of the juvenile's parent, guardian, or custodian, and\n   <em>\n    allegations of facts sufficient to invoke jurisdiction over the juvenile.\n   </em>\n   A person whose actions resulted in a conviction under G.S. 14-27.2 or G.S. 14-27.3 and the conception of the juvenile need not be named in the petition. The petition may contain information on more than one juvenile when the juveniles are from the same home and are before the court for the same reason.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12633155\" index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/se2d/614/489/#p491\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 7B-402(a) (2005) (emphasis added). Tellingly, N.C.G.S. \u00a7 7B-402 indicates that it is the \"allegations of facts\" of the child's situation which must be \"sufficient to invoke jurisdiction over the juvenile.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12633155\" index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/se2d/614/489/#p491\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The factual allegations, not the form of the petition, determine the question of jurisdiction. Here, respondent-mother does not contend the petition lacks any of the specified information.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Plainly, had it intended verification to be a jurisdictional prerequisite, the General Assembly could have included a verification requirement in Article 2. Not only did the legislature choose not to do this, it did not even deem verification worthy of inclusion among the substantive juvenile petition elements detailed in N.C.G.S. \u00a7 7B-402. Instead the legislature placed the verification requirement in N.C.G.S. \u00a7 7B-403 (\"Receipt of reports; filing of petition\") a statute devoted to procedural matters:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   All reports concerning a juvenile alleged to be abused, neglected, or dependent shall be referred to the director of the department of social services for screening. Thereafter, if it is determined by the director that a report should be filed as a petition, the petition shall be drawn by the director, verified before an official authorized to administer oaths, and filed by the clerk, recording the date of filing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   N.C.G.S. \u00a7 7B-403(a) (2005). The obvious conclusion we should draw is that verification of juvenile petitions is a procedural, not a jurisdictional requirement. While the majority rightly opines that the purpose of verification is to ensure DSS thoroughly investigates allegations of abuse, neglect, and dependency before seeking judicial intervention, it does not follow that the requirement is jurisdictional. Nothing in N.C.G.S. \u00a7 7B-403 suggests its provisions should be construed as jurisdictional in nature. The majority simply holds the verification requirement to be so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Significantly, unlike with other governmental actors, the General Assembly specifically allows the drafting and filing of a juvenile petition by a non-lawyer DSS director.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12633155\" index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/se2d/614/489/#p491\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 84-4 (2005);\n   <em>\n    see also\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12633155\" index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/se2d/614/489/#p491\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 7B-403(a). This unique authority recognizes the need to seek promptly the supervision of the trial court. Nonetheless, without attorney involvement,\n   procedural errors could be more likely to occur.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   The General Assembly anticipated procedural miscues and thus included a remedy in Subchapter I for mistakes like the one that occurred in this case. Errors in the form of a petition, such as a verification omission, can be cured through amendment. N.C.G.S. \u00a7 7B-800 provides: \"The court may permit a petition to be amended when the amendment does not change the nature of the conditions upon which the petition is based.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12633155\" index=\"127\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/se2d/614/489/#p491\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 7B-800 (2005). This provision specifically allows the correction of mistakes which do not change the \"nature\" of the allegations contained in a juvenile petition. Hence, if as the majority opines, the \"provisions in Chapter 7B establish one continuous juvenile case with several interrelated stages,\" WCDSS should be allowed to amend its petition by adding a verification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Treating the verification requirement as procedural is consistent with the North Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure. Rule 11 (\"Signing and verification of pleadings\") requires all filings to be made in good faith.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12633155\" index=\"128\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/se2d/614/489/#p491\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1A-1, Rule 11(a) (2005). The rule specifically permits a party to sign an unsigned filing, provided he does so promptly after the omission is called to his attention.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12633155\" index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/se2d/614/489/#p491\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In juvenile petitions, the DSS director confirms verification by signing the petition. Since Rule 11 allows signatures to be added after filing, the omission of a signature from a juvenile petition is not jurisdictional.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Although there appear to be no North Carolina cases applying Rule 11 to verification requirements, there are many federal ones. As North Carolina's Rule 11 is substantially similar to the federal rule, the decisions of the federal courts are instructive.\n   <em>\n    See Bryson v. Sullivan,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2508834\" index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc/330/644/#p655\">\n    330 N.C. 644\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 655,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"131\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=412%20S.E.2d%20327\">\n    412 S.E.2d 327\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 332 (1992);\n   <em>\n    Turner v.

The opinion presents no compelling reasoning for us to follow.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Although I agree with the majority that the General Assembly attempted to balance the rights of parents and children, the majority decision does little to protect parents and much to harm children. The majority suggests verification protects parents by having an identifiable government actor \"vouch\" for the validity of the allegations in a juvenile petition to ensure that a \"department of social services intervention ... is based upon valid and substantive allegations.\" While these goals may be advanced if the omission were intentional and the missing verification\n   noticed before a custody hearing, they are not furthered by vacating custody orders entered after evidence has been received at a hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Here, there is no hint that WCDSS acted improperly. In fact, WCDSS showed considerable restraint by attempting to resolve the situation without judicial intervention, and the trial court found that WCDSS was entirely justified in filing a petition to have T.R.P. adjudicated a neglected juvenile. The petition identified the petitioner, and the failure to verify it appears to be a mere administrative oversight. To ignore an adjudication on the merits because of inadvertence hardly promotes the best interest of T.R.P. As such, the majority's interpretation of N.C.G.S. \u00a7 7B-403 cannot be reconciled with the principles of construction set out in N.C.G.S. \u00a7 7B-100.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Nor is verification the vital safeguard portrayed by the majority. The goal is to initiate court intervention only into meritorious cases in which evidence exists to support the allegations. Once the process is begun, however, it is the in-court testimony, not the original verification, that determines the need and degree of DSS intervention. In fact, in an emergency situation, DSS is authorized to act without a petition. N.C.G.S. \u00a7 7B-500 (2005). Whether or not the petition is verified, DSS intervention could still be inappropriate. Were a petition to be filed because of ill motives, the trial court could address the problem by issuing sanctions against the responsible party. Such a tailored response is preferable to dismissing all juvenile cases that originated with unverified petitions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   In this case, the petition contained sufficient allegations of neglect to invoke the trial court's jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8688239\" index=\"178\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc/90/151/#p152\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 7B-200(a). As envisioned by N.C.G.S. \u00a7 7B-100(2), the trial court has entered a judgment \"that reflects consideration of the facts, the needs and limitations of the juvenile, and the strengths and weaknesses of the family.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8688239\" index=\"179\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc/90/151/#p152\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 7B-100(2). The majority admits the court properly found T.R.P. to be neglected and developed a placement plan in her best interest. Nonetheless, after more than two years, the majority would now disrupt the placement of the child and return her to the status quo ante. This outcome clearly contradicts the statutory directive \"that when it is not in the juvenile's best interest to be returned home, the juvenile [should] be placed in a safe, permanent home within a reasonable amount of time.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8688239\" index=\"180\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc/90/151/#p152\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 7B-100(5). Absent a clear statutory mandate, I cannot agree with the majority that careful consideration of a child's best interest by a court with general subject matter jurisdiction over abuse, neglect, and dependency actions should be disregarded because of a technical omission that in no way affected the court proceedings or harmed anyone involved.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Moreover, the majority's decision is not limited to the facts of this case; its potential disruptive effect on abused, neglected, or dependent children is staggering. Children are often placed with persons who have no legal right to custody apart from a court order. Even after the passage of considerable time, a biological parent who finds a procedural defect in the DSS petition could completely undermine years of stability and healing by setting aside all the court's orders addressing the merits and demanding a return to the status quo ante without regard to the child's welfare. Children on the doorstep of adoption might be returned to their biological parents only to be removed again. In short, the majority's approach will potentially \"result in protracted custody proceedings that leave ... the child in legal limbo .... thwart[ing] the legislature's wish that children be placed `in ... safe, permanent home[s] within a reasonable amount of time.'\"\n   <em>\n    R.T.W.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3804066\" index=\"181\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc/359/539/#p543\">\n    359 N.C. at 547\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12633155\" index=\"182\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/se2d/614/489/#p491\">\n    614 S.E.2d at 494\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (alterations in original) (quoting N.C.G.S. \u00a7 7B-100(5)).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   At its core, this case is about two different types of neglect.
