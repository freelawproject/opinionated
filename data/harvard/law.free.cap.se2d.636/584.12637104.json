We determine there was no error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    FACTS\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On 12 January 2004, Jasmine Alberto Andujar (\"defendant\") was indicted for one count of first-degree burglary and one count of robbery with a dangerous weapon. The case was tried before a jury on 22 August 2005 in the Criminal Session of Beaufort County Superior Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The State presented evidence at trial which tended to show the following: On or about the night of 18 August 2003, the Morales family, consisting of father Crisantos, mother Maria, sons Eliel and Irvin, and daughter Lucero, was sleeping in their mobile home. The sleeping arrangements for the family consisted of Crisantos and his youngest son, Irvin, sleeping on the floor in the living room, Maria and Lucero sleeping in one of the bedrooms and the older son, Eliel, sleeping in the second bedroom.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Lucero testified that she was awaken from her sleep when she heard voices in the living room and the loud noise of someone kicking on the front door. Lucero got up and walked into the living room and saw two men pointing guns at her father and little brother. One of the men was Hispanic or Puerto Rican and the other was a black man. The black man had a shotgun and the Hispanic man had a handgun. Eventually, the entire Morales family was held at gunpoint in the living room. While being held at gunpoint, the men stole money from the Morales family, stole jewelry from them, assaulted Crisantos, and threatened to kill Irvin.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   At some point Crisantos began struggling with one of the intruders and was able to wrestle the shotgun away from him. The intruders ran out the door, into the street, and got in their vehicle and drove off. Lucero immediately called the police. An ambulance\n   was called and Crisantos was taken to the hospital for treatment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Yolanda Daniels (\"Yolanda\") testified that on or about 20 August 2003, defendant came to her house and told her that he and a black man, Sherman, had a confrontation with some Mexicans. Yolanda testified that the confrontation with the Mexicans involved a struggle over a gun. Defendant told Yolanda that one of the Mexicans got hit with a gun and was injured. Yolanda also testified that the Mexican needed medical attention due to the injury he sustained.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Beaufort County Sheriff Office Investigator Royce Lee Hamm, Jr., (\"Officer Hamm\") testified that on or about 21 August 2003, he and Officer Gentry Pinner (\"Officer Pinner\") went to Yolanda's house based on a lead to a possible suspect in the burglary and robbery of the Morales home and family. Defendant was at Yolanda's house when Officers Hamm and Pinner arrived. Officer Pinner went to the front door, and Officer Hamm went around to the backdoor. While Officer Hamm was standing by the backdoor, defendant came out of the door. Defendant immediately starting running when he saw Officer Hamm standing there. Officer Hamm called defendant by his name and told him that he just wanted to talk to him, but defendant kept running. Officer Hamm did not pursue defendant as he did not have a warrant for his arrest. Officer Hamm testified that after defendant fled Yolanda's house, he met with Yolanda. Yolanda's statements to Officer Hamm were consistent with her trial testimony. Officer Hamm also testified that on or about 27 August 2003, he talked with members of the Morales family. Officer Hamm testified that he took a statement from Lucero, and that her statement was consistent with her trial testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Ricky Wayne Smith (\"Smith\") testified that while he shared a jail cell with defendant in the Beaufort County Jail, defendant told him that he and a friend robbed some Mexicans at the Mexicans' house. Defendant told Smith that he had a gun and his friend had a Mossberry when they broke into and entered the house and robbed the Mexicans. Smith testified that a Mossberry is a shotgun. Defendant told Smith that when they entered the Mexicans' home, the father and a son were in the front room. Defendant told Smith that his friend held the shotgun on the father and son while he went to a bedroom and took some money. Defendant also told Smith that the father started to fight with his friend over the shotgun and that defendant whipped the Mexican father with his gun.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Defendant did not present any evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <em>\n    I.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Defendant contends he was denied his right to effective assistance of counsel when his trial counsel did not make a motion to dismiss the charge of first-degree burglary and the lesser included offenses based on insufficient evidence.

Defendant's contention in his brief is that there was insufficient evidence of defendant breaking and entering into the Morales home. Defendant's brief asserts that there was no testimony which shows either an actual or constructive non-consensual entry. Defendant did not contend in his brief that there was insufficient evidence presented at trial regarding any of the other elements of first-degree burglary, and therefore, questions regarding the other elements are abandoned.

In the statement, Lucero stated that she was awakened by the loud noise of someone kicking on the front door.

Therefore, there is sufficient evidence that a breaking and entering took place.

Defendant contends that no one with first-hand knowledge of the robbery identified defendant as one of the perpetrators, and therefore, insufficient evidence was presented at trial to convict defendant of the charge. Defendant does not claim insufficient evidence of any of the elements of robbery with a dangerous weapon, so he has abandoned any such argument. N.C. R.App. P. 28(b)(6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   In the instant case, multiple witnesses testified regarding the robbery. Lucero testified that two men, one meeting\n   the general description of defendant, robbed her family. Yolanda testified that defendant told her that he and a black man had gotten in some trouble with some Mexicans and at least one gun was involved. Defendant told Yolanda that there was a struggle over the gun, and that one of the Mexicans had been hit with the gun and needed medical treatment. Officer Hamm testified that, during his investigation of the crime, he went to Yolanda's home searching for a possible suspect. When he was near the backdoor of Yolanda's home, defendant came out of the backdoor, saw Officer Hamm, and ran away. Finally, Smith testified that defendant told him that he and a friend had broken into the house of some Mexicans and robbed them. Defendant told Smith that they found the father and son in the front room and held the father at gunpoint with a shotgun while defendant took some money. Defendant also told Smith that he whipped the father with a gun. This is sufficient evidence that defendant was the perpetrator of the instant offense. Further, there is no reasonable probability that, in the absence of counsel's alleged errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Accordingly, we disagree with defendant's contention.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <em>\n    III.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Defendant contends the trial court erred as a matter of law, or, in the alternative, committed plain error by failing to dismiss the charges of first-degree burglary and robbery with a dangerous weapon because there was insufficient evidence presented at trial that defendant was the perpetrator.

In that case, the defendant's counsel asked for a mitigated sentence, stating:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   [T]he offense he's been convicted of is certainly far beyond anything he's ever experienced as a Level 3. The absolute[] minimum sentence is 70 months. That is ample ... deterrence. I understand that it would probably be a long shot to think the mitigated range[,] but certainly if a message needs to be sent, ... that's enough time to send that kind of message.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 271,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=588%20S.E.2d%20893\">\n    588 S.E.2d at 898\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Then, the trial judge made the following statement:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   At the beginning of the trial I gave you one opportunity where you could have exposed yourself probably to about 70 months but you chose not to take advantage of that. I'm going to sentence you to a minimum of 96 and a maximum of 125 months in the North Carolina Department of Corrections.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 272,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=588%20S.E.2d%20893\">\n    588 S.E.2d at 898\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We determined that the trial judge's statement did not \"rise to the level of the statements our Courts have held to be improper considerations of a defendant's exercise of his right to a jury trial.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 272,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=588%20S.E.2d%20893\">\n    588 S.E.2d at 898\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The facts of the instant case do not rise to the level of either\n   <em>\n    Cannon\n   </em>\n   or\n   <em>\n    Gantt.\n   </em>\n   During the sentencing phase of the instant case, the trial court did not inquire about the existence of a plea offer. The trial court did ask the prosecutor whether he had made any progress finding out the identity of the other party involved in committing the crimes. The prosecutor responded, and on his own accord, stated that \"[t]he original plea offer was to consolidate these cases if he would offer truthful testimony against ... whoever the other individual was.\" The trial court made no comments regarding the plea agreement and then sentenced defendant to consecutive terms. After the sentencing, defense counsel asked the trial judge if she heard the trial judge correctly regarding the sentencing. The trial judge stated that the terms would be consecutive and that defendant was given a plea offer to run them concurrent, but he had rejected that plea.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   \"Although we disapprove of the trial court's reference to defendant's failure to enter a plea agreement, `we cannot, under the facts of this case, say that defendant was prejudiced or that defendant was more severely punished because he exercised his constitutional right to trial by jury.'\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 272-73,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=588%20S.E.2d%20893\">\n    588 S.E.2d at 898\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation omitted). Nothing in the record illustrates that the trial judge based his sentence on anything but the evidence before him. Here, the trial judge did not even reference the plea deal during sentencing as the trial judge did in\n   <em>\n    Gantt.\n   </em>\n   Also, we do not think the trial judge punished defendant for not accepting the plea agreement. Therefore, we see no merit in defendant's contention.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   No error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Judges WYNN and McGEE concur.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
