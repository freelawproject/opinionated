We find no prejudicial error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    I. Background\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The State's evidence tended to show on 28 October 2004, North Carolina State Highway Patrol Trooper Zeb Stroup (\"Trooper Stroup\") sat inside his stationary patrol vehicle while he investigated vehicles for registration violations and observed seatbelt compliance. Trooper Stroup observed a gray minivan driven by defendant, checked the license plate displayed, and discovered the required liability insurance coverage had lapsed. When defendant stopped his vehicle at a red light, Trooper Stroup drove his vehicle behind defendant's vehicle. After defendant turned right at the light, Trooper Stroup followed and activated his blue lights. Defendant failed to stop his vehicle. While Trooper Stroup pursued defendant's vehicle through a lightly traveled residential area, he observed defendant remove his seatbelt, run a stop sign, travel left of center, and reach the speed of forty miles per hour. During the pursuit, the vehicles reached a maximum speed of eighty-five miles per hour.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Defendant drove his vehicle onto a gravel road and exited his vehicle. Defendant ran and Trooper Stroup followed on foot. After traveling approximately 100 yards, Trooper Stroup overtook defendant, wrestled him to the ground, and subdued him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Defendant apologized to Trooper Stroup and stated he had fled because \"he was afraid [Trooper Stroup would] take him to jail for his [revoked driver's] license.\" Trooper Stroup testified the entire chase, both in the vehicles and on foot, took about three minutes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On 7 February 2005, a grand jury indicted defendant for: (1) driving left of center; (2) reckless driving to endanger; (3) driving while license revoked; (4) no liability insurance; (5) speeding; (6) resisting a public officer; (7) fleeing or eluding arrest; (8) failure to wear a seatbelt; and (9) failure to stop at a stop sign. The grand jury also indicted defendant as an habitual felon based upon allegations he had previously been convicted of: (1) breaking and entering on 6 February 1992; (2) breaking and entering on\n   13 January 1993; and (3) breaking and entering a motor vehicle on 5 January 1999.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Defendant testified and admitted to virtually all the evidence presented except the speed of the vehicles. Defendant also called two witnesses who testified his minivan probably could not attain a speed of eighty-five miles per hour. The jury found defendant guilty of: (1) reckless driving; (2) driving while license revoked; (3) resisting a law enforcement officer; (4) exceeding the legal speed limit; (5) eluding arrest; and (6) failure to stop at stop sign.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Defendant's trial for attaining the status of an habitual felon followed. The jury found defendant guilty of attaining the status of an habitual felon. The trial court arrested judgment on defendant's convictions for: (1) driving while license revoked; (2) speeding; and (3) reckless driving. The trial court consolidated the charges and sentenced defendant to an active term of 133 months minimum and 169 months maximum. Defendant appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <em>\n    II. Issues\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Defendant argues the trial court erred by: (1) sentencing him as a prior record level IV offender and asserts the State failed to prove his prior record points and convictions and (2) denying defense counsel's motion to withdraw based upon a conflict of interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <em>\n    III. Defendant's Sentence\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Defendant argues he is entitled to a new sentencing hearing because the trial court erred in sentencing him as a prior record level IV offender. Defendant asserts the State failed to prove his convictions and prior record points equal level IV. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <em>\n    A.

Motion to Dismiss\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The State argues that defendant failed to preserve this issue for review because he failed to object during the defendant's sentencing phase as required by Rule 10(b)(1) of the North Carolina Rules of Appellate Procedure.

An otherwise unsupported worksheet tendered by the State establishing a defendant's prior record level is not even sufficient to meet the catchall provision found in N.C.

The worksheet\n   contained the following offenses: (1) 90 CRS 004796-three counts of felony breaking and entering and larceny, one count of forgery/attempting uttering; (2) 92 CRS 061415-one count of felony breaking and entering and larceny; (3) 93 CR 062241-two counts of misrepresentation to obtain employment security benefits, two counts of misrepresentation to prevent employment security benefits; (4) 97 CR 064306-one count of possession of drug paraphernalia; (5) 98 CR 010899-one count of misdemeanor possession of stolen goods; (6) 98 CRS 11637- one count of felony larceny after breaking and entering, one count of breaking and entering a motor vehicle, three counts of felony possession of stolen goods, and two counts of breaking and entering and larceny; (7) 89 CR 002999-one count of possession of drug paraphernalia; and (8) one count of misdemeanor larceny in Michigan on 24 March 1987. The prosecutor asserted these prior convictions equal eleven points, and defendant should be sentenced as a prior record level IV offender.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   At defendant's sentencing hearing, the following colloquy ensued:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   State: Judge, I have removed the convictions that were used for the purpose of habitual felon. However, on those days there were multiple convictions, so the points for what he was convicted on those days still makes him a Record Level 4. Does defendant stipulate to what I'm handing up to his Honor, the contents of the gold sheet showing eleven points, making him a Record Level 4?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Defense Counsel: I don't believe he can stipulate to that.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   . . . .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Court: Do you have any evidence to offer that's contrary to that?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Defense Counsel: No, we don't.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Court: Then excluding the specific felonies for which he was found guilty of and used as an underlying support for elevating this felony to the level of being an habitual felon, the Court finds and concludes that the defendant is a Record Level 4 for sentencing purposes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Defendant did not stipulate at sentencing to the prior record level worksheet the State tendered. In addition to tendering the worksheet, the State presented certified copies of the following court records: (1) 90 CRS 004796-three counts of felony breaking and entering and larceny, one count of forgery/attempting uttering; (2) 92 CRS 061415-one count of felony breaking and entering and larceny; and (3) 98 CRS 11637-one count of felony larceny after breaking and entering and one count of breaking and entering a motor vehicle. Defendant admitted the following convictions: (1) 89 CR 002999-one count of possession of drug paraphernalia; (2) 98 CR 010899-one count of misdemeanor possession of stolen goods; and (3) 97 CR 064306-one count of possession of drug paraphernalia.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Excluding the three convictions alleged in defendant's habitual felon indictment, the State proved, either by defendant's admissions or by certified copies of court records, the following convictions: (1) 90 CRS 004796-two counts of felony breaking and entering and three counts of larceny, one count of forgery/attempting uttering; (2) 92 CRS 061415-one count of larceny; (3) 98 CRS 11637-one count of felony larceny after breaking and entering; (4) 89 CR 002999-one count of possession of drug paraphernalia; (5) 98 CR 010899-one count of misdemeanor possession of stolen goods; and (6) 97 CR 064306-one count of possession of drug paraphernalia.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Under N.C.

The State also proved three Class A1 or Class 1 misdemeanors for convictions 89 CR 002999, 98 CR 010899, and 97 CR 064306.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The trial court incorrectly attributed to defendant five instead of three misdemeanor points. The number of defendant's points admitted or proven total nine. Nine points show defendant accumulated a prior record\n   level of IV. N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 15A-1340.14(c) (the prior record level for felony sentencing is level IV for at least nine, but not more than fourteen points). With nine prior record points, defendant was correctly sentenced as a prior record level IV under N.C.

Defense Counsel's Motion to Withdraw\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Defendant argues the trial court erred by denying defense counsel's motion to withdraw based upon an asserted conflict of interest. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   At the trial court's hearing on defense counsel's motion to withdraw, counsel argued he must be allowed to withdraw because of a conflict of interest. The conflict arose from counsel's opinion that he needed to file a motion for appropriate relief challenging one of the three guilty-pled convictions underlying defendant's habitual felon charge. One of defense counsel's colleagues in the Buncombe County Public Defender's Office had represented defendant on the conviction subject to the motion for appropriate relief. Defense counsel argued that a conflict existed because he would have to file a motion for appropriate relief against one of his colleagues.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 15A-144 (2005) states, \"The court may allow an attorney to withdraw from a criminal proceeding upon a showing of good cause.\" Rule 1.7, Comment 4 of the North Carolina State Bar Revised Rules of Professional Conduct (2006) states, \"[i]f a conflict arises after representation has been undertaken, the lawyer ordinarily must withdraw from the representation, unless the lawyer has obtained the informed consent of the client[.]\" Rule 1.7, Comment 5 of the North Carolina State Bar Revised Rules of Professional Conduct (2006) states, \"Unforeseeable developments . . . might create conflicts in the midst of representation . . . .

Defendant's argument is without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Defendant failed to argue at trial or on appeal that the trial court's denial of defense counsel's motion to withdraw resulted in ineffective assistance of counsel.
