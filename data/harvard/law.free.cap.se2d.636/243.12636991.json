Ballinger appeals from an order imposing a $5,000.00 sanction under both Rule 11 of the Rules of Civil Procedure and the trial court's inherent supervisory powers. We hold that the trial court did not err in imposing sanctions, but that the order does not contain adequate findings of fact to explain the basis for the court's selection of the sanction ultimately imposed. We, therefore, remand for entry of further findings of fact.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <em>\n    Facts\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Mr. Ballinger has represented several of testatrix Myrtle Greeson Canoy's children in lengthy legal proceedings regarding Ms. Canoy's estate. Under Ms. Canoy's will, one of the Canoy children, Roger, was granted a life estate in the decedent's real property. Roger refused to pay the taxes on the property, however, which ultimately resulted in litigation with his siblings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In October 1998, pursuant to a court order, a portion of the decedent's real property not subject to the life estate was sold in order to pay outstanding taxes and close the estate. After paying various expenses, the estate's Administrator, Scott Nash Dunn, was unable to determine which defendants were entitled to the money remaining in the estate and, therefore, filed an interpleader complaint in which he sought to have the trial court order the various defendants to \"interplead their respective claims and settle their claims between themselves,\" permit Mr. Dunn to pay the estate's balance to the Clerk of Superior Court in Randolph County, and \"discharge [Mr. Dunn] from all liability in this matter.\" In July 2003, Mr. Ballinger, representing several of the defendants, filed an answer with counterclaims and cross-claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The matter was heard by Judge John O. Craig III on 10 June 2004. At the hearing, Judge Craig encouraged a settlement in which Roger would release his life estate in exchange for fee-simple title to an 18-acre parcel of the decedent's land. The remaining Canoy children would become fee-simple owners of the decedent's remaining 42 acres. Following Judge Craig's recommendation, the parties discussed various details, including the likelihood of future litigation, taxation, whether the consent of spouses was necessary, and outstanding fees for the administrator and the various attorneys.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   After this discussion, the following exchange occurred:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   MR. BALLINGER: . . . . I really appreciate [the court's] attempts to settle this matter and [sic] most gracious and we accept it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   THE COURT: Do you accept the settlement on behalf of your clients?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   MR. BALLINGER: Yes, I do.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Judge Craig then summarized the agreement:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   If Mr. Roger Canoy relinquishes his life estate in all of the property except the eighteen-approximately, eighteen acres that are north of the creek, then the remaining heirs will become holders of that property south of the creek as fee simple, free and clear owners of the property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   He added that the settlement \"would almost have the same effect\" as if Roger died, explaining that his \"life estate would end and all the other heirs would then become outright owners of it because the remainder interest would come into being. . . .\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Although one Canoy child not represented by Mr. Ballinger objected to the settlement, Mr. Ballinger gave no indication that he did not approve of the settlement and explained his understanding that:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   We [(Mr. Ballinger's clients)] would renounce the rights to the eighteen acres and convey the right, title and interest to the eighteen acres to Roger Canoy on that side of the creek. And Roger would renounce all rights to all the property and all the monies in the Clerk of Court or in the hands of the Administrator or anyone else. That he would renounce-he would just sign a deed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In response to Mr. Ballinger's concerns regarding potential future claims between the parties, Judge Craig added that he understood the agreement \"would be in language in which there were full and complete releases signed going every which way so that no one would have a claim against the other. . . .\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   All parties then agreed to the settlement on the record and under oath. Judge Craig designated Mr. Dunn as the primary draftsman. Judge Craig then notified the parties that he would be out of the country beginning on 17 June 2004.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On 11 June 2004, Mr. Dunn mailed a draft order to the court and provided a copy to counsel on the same date. On 14 June 2004, the court returned the order to Mr. Dunn with certain revisions. On 15 June 2004, Mr. Ballinger sent Judge Craig, with copies to counsel, a draft order that he had prepared. He stated in his letter: \"Enclosed is a copy of a Consent Judgment I am prepared to have my clients sign.\" In a subsequent affidavit, Mr. Ballinger explained that he felt it was \"easier to simply draft a proposed consent judgment rather than take on the task of trying to address Mr. Dunn's draft at that time.\" The following day, Mr. Ballinger sent a second letter to Judge Craig stating: \"Enclosed is a copy of a Consent Judgment I am having my clients sign. Having not heard from you, I presume that as to you the enclosed is satisfactory.\" Mr. Ballinger explained that he believed his proposed settlement agreement would quiet title as to all who signed it and prevent further litigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   On 25 June 2004, Mr. Dunn wrote Mr. Ballinger, advised him that his proposed consent judgment was not acceptable, and enclosed a revised version of Mr. Dunn's proposed judgment. On 1 July 2004, Mr. Dunn sent an additional revision, asking whether it was acceptable. On 28 July 2004, Mr. Dunn forwarded a final version of the consent judgment and asked that it be signed and returned by 20 August 2004. He added: \"The failure of any party to comply with this request may result in a contempt motion being filed against them.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   On 15 August 2004, Mr. Ballinger sent a seven-page letter to Mr. Dunn with a copy to Judge Craig raising numerous concerns about the consent judgment, stating that his clients declined to sign it, and withdrawing the \"proposed settlement\" embodied in Mr. Ballinger's proposed judgment. On the same date, Mr. Ballinger sent a 13-page letter directly to Judge Craig, requesting that the judge reconsider signing Mr. Dunn's proposed order. The letter stated that both Mr. Ballinger and his clients objected to Judge Craig \"sign[ing] any order without further negotiation\" and that they would not \"sign a consent order that is contrary to that which [Mr. Ballinger's] clients would find to be acceptable.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   On 1 September 2004, the court forwarded a calendar setting the matter for hearing on 16 September 2004. On 6 September 2004, Mr. Ballinger sent a 10-page letter to Judge Craig and Judge Russell G. Walker, Jr., arguing the merits of his clients' claims, requesting rulings on the merits, and expressing the opinion that the matter could not be settled without the presence of additional parties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Following these series of letters, Mr. Dunn filed a motion requesting that Mr. Ballinger and several Canoy children be held in civil contempt for willful non-compliance with prior court orders. Judge Craig conducted a hearing on 16 September 2004 at which he informed Mr. Ballinger that he believed Mr. Ballinger's conduct had violated a North Carolina State Bar Ethics Opinion and several of the Revised Rules of Professional Conduct. Judge Craig also expressed his belief that Mr. Ballinger's description of the settlement differed from what was actually agreed to at the 10 June 2004 hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   At the hearing, Mr. Ballinger announced that \"as far as consenting to the judgment, I have not at any time refused to consent to the judgment and will sign the thing today, if that's your order that [my clients] can't withdraw their exceptions. We respectfully submit to exactly what was in the court transcript last time. And my clients would consent to that, also.\" Later, Mr. Ballinger signed the back of the transcript of the 10 June 2004 hearing and handed it to his clients stating: \"I asked them to sign it. But . . . I'm not refusing to sign it. I didn't recommend that they sign [the agreement reached 10 June], but they agreed to it. Therefore, I will sign it.\" Judge Craig suggested that if any of Mr. Ballinger's clients declined to sign the transcript, he might have a conflict of interest. Mr. Ballinger then withdrew his signature.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   At the end of the hearing, Judge Craig told Mr. Ballinger: \"I am not looking so much as a contempt of court citation toward you, but I am seriously going to inquire as to whether it's appropriate to impose sanctions under Rule 11.\" Judge Craig then scheduled an additional hearing for 30 September 2004.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   At the 30 September hearing, Judge Craig accepted an affidavit from Mr. Ballinger explaining his actions. Judge Craig then questioned Mr. Ballinger and the other lawyers regarding what had occurred at the original hearing. Further, after reviewing a brief submitted by one of the other attorneys, Judge Craig concluded that he could not enter the consent judgment without consent of all the parties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   On 4 March 2005, Judge Craig entered an order concluding that Mr. Ballinger's letters dated 15 and 16 June 2004, 15 August 2004, and 6 September 2004 came within the scope of Rule 11, were interposed for an improper purpose, and justified sanctions under Rule 11. In addition, Judge Craig concluded that \"Mr. Ballinger's actions during the hearing on September 16, whereby he stated that his previous letters were entirely the fault of his clients, and his theatrical gesture of signing the consent order, were at best disingenuous concealments or facile misrepresentations to the Court since he attempted to distance himself from the contents of his own letters.\" He concluded that this conduct \"appears to have violated Rule 1.7(a)(1) and Rule 1.8(g) of the Revised Rules of Professional Conduct\" and \"[i]n any event, his actions constituted a deception practiced against this Court and wasted the Court's time as well as the time of the attorneys involved, all at the ultimate expense of his clients and the other parties to these actions.\" Judge Craig's order stated that he chose to sanction this \"improper, vexatious conduct\" under the inherent powers of the court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Judge Craig's order stated that he had considered the range of sanctions available to him, including reprimand or censure, but had concluded, in his discretion, \"that a monetary sanction of $5,000 is appropriate under Rule 11 and the Court's inherent authority over proceedings to punish Mr. Ballinger for his misconduct, with the money to be paid to the Estate of Myrtle Greeson Canoy for its use in defraying the expenses and attorney fees (excluding Mr. Ballinger's fees and expenses) that have arisen as a result of the various hearings which were held after preparation for and attendance at the June 10, 2004 hearing.\" Judge Craig also ordered (1) that Mr. Ballinger not charge his clients for any work or expenses in connection with preparation for, or attendance at, the 30 September 2004 hearing and (2) that the matters in the order be referred to the North Carolina State Bar.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Mr. Ballinger timely appealed to this Court. We note that the record on appeal indicated that Judge Craig was the appellee. This Court entered an order\n   <em>\n    ex mero motu\n   </em>\n   stating that, although Judge Craig's order was being appealed, \"Judge Craig is not now nor [w]as he ever . . . a party to this action and [he was] improperly named as a party in the record on appeal.\" This Court thereafter dismissed Judge Craig as a party.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Mr. Ballinger first challenges the propriety of Judge Craig's ruling on sanctions and the process by which sanctions were imposed. We hold that he has failed to demonstrate any error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Mr. Ballinger argues that Judge Craig should have granted his motion that the judge recuse himself from hearing any sanctions motion. \"[A] party has a right to be tried before a judge whose impartiality cannot reasonably be questioned.\"\n   <em>\n    State v. Fie,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4723431\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc/320/626/#p627\">\n    320 N.C. 626\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 627,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=359%20S.E.2d%20774\">\n    359 S.E.2d 774\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 775 (1987). Therefore, \"[o]n a motion of any party, a judge should [be] disqualif[ied] . . . in a proceeding in which his impartiality may reasonably be questioned, including but not limited to instances where . . . [h]e has a personal bias or prejudice concerning a party. . . .\" N.C.Code of Judicial Conduct, Canon 3(C)(1)(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The party moving for disqualification bears the burden of demonstrating objectively that grounds for disqualification actually exist.\n   <em>\n    Lange v.

This Court has explained that \"[t]he moving party, supported\n   by affidavits, may meet his burden by presenting `substantial evidence that there exists such a personal bias, prejudice or interest on the part of the judge that he would be unable to rule impartially.'\"\n   <em>\n    County of Johnston v.

Instead, Mr. Ballinger's sole argument both to Judge Craig and on appeal is that Judge Craig's annoyance with Mr. Ballinger's disruption of the settlement warranted recusal. This Court has specifically held that a judge's reaction to attempts to disrupt a potential settlement does not, without more, require recusal:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   We note that a trial judge's decision to \"explor[e] settlement possibilities [is] a function to be commended to all trial judges in civil cases\" and is not generally a ground for disqualifying a judge.\n   <em>\n    Roper v.

Beyond Judge Craig's reaction regarding Mr. Ballinger's actions in connection with the settlement agreement, the record reveals nothing that could be construed as demonstrating any personal bias, prejudice, or interest by Judge Craig.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Indeed, to require recusal in this instance would be to require recusal whenever an attorney engages in sanctionable conduct offending or irritating a judge. Not surprisingly, Mr. Ballinger has cited no authority requiring that a new judge determine whether conduct before another judge warrants sanctions.\n   <em>\n    See Nakell,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8523507\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc-app/104/638/#p647\">\n    104 N.C.App. at 648\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=411%20S.E.2d%20159\">\n    411 S.E.2d at 165\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Our examination of the record reveals no bias, prejudice, or proof that would require the judge\n   <em>\n    before whom the contempt was committed\n   </em>\n   to recuse himself from conducting a hearing [on the contempt].\" (emphasis added)). In the absence of some other indication that Judge Craig harbored personal bias or prejudice against Mr. Ballinger, or was somehow improperly interested in the outcome of this case, we conclude that Mr. Ballinger has failed to demonstrate that the motion for recusal should have been allowed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Mr. Ballinger alternatively contends that Judge Craig lacked authority to address sanctions because Judge Craig had improperly assumed the role of a mediator in the proceedings. It is true that Canon 5(E) of the North Carolina Code of Judicial Conduct provides that \"[a] judge should not act as an arbitrator or mediator.\" Additionally, Mr. Ballinger is correct that, at the 10 June 2004 hearing, Judge Craig expressed his personal opinions on the case and stated that \"in so giving and expressing my opinion and telling you what I think is a good idea, it probably removes me from that air of neutrality or impartiality and would, therefore, make it difficult for me to ethically hear any of the motions.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   While, as Judge Craig acknowledged, these remarks could interfere with his ability to preside over continued proceedings regarding the merits of the action, Mr. Ballinger has cited no authority for his conclusion that \"Judge Craig lost his authority to judicially discipline [Mr. Ballinger]. . . .\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   N.C.R.App. P. 28(b)(6) (\"Assignments of error . . . in support of which no reason or argument is stated\n   <em>\n    or authority cited,\n   </em>\n   will be taken as abandoned.\" (emphasis added)). Nor have we found any authority supporting Mr. Ballinger's position. Accordingly, Mr. Ballinger has failed to demonstrate that Judge Craig's conduct at the 10 June hearing stripped him of authority to impose sanctions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Mr. Ballinger also argues that he was denied procedural due process under the federal\n   and state constitutions because he was not given adequate notice of the charges, sufficient opportunity to respond, permission to call witnesses, or a list identifying the evidence upon which the court was basing its sanction order. The record indicates otherwise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   \"`Notice and an opportunity to be heard prior to depriving a person of his property are essential elements of due process of law which is guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution.'\"\n   <em>\n    Griffin v.

We note, however, that Mr. Ballinger's letters were\n   <em>\n    responding to\n   </em>\n   Mr. Dunn's proposed order and explaining why, according to Mr. Ballinger, that order was in error and proposing an alternative order. We cannot agree with the trial court that a lawyer necessarily commits professional misconduct if he simply sends a letter in response to a proposed order that was submitted directly to the trial judge without prior opportunity for the lawyer to comment on the draft order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   A contrary construction of the Rules of Professional Conduct would be inconsistent with 97 Formal Ethics Op. 5 (1998), which provides:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   [F]ailure to give the opposing lawyer an opportunity to comment upon or object to a proposed order before it is submitted to the judge is unprofessional and may be prejudicial to the administration of justice. It is the more professional practice for a lawyer to provide the opposing counsel with a copy of a proposed order in advance of delivering the proposed order to the judge and\n   <em>\n    thereby give the opposing counsel an adequate opportunity to comment upon or object to the proposed order.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   At a minimum, Rule 3.5(a)(3)(ii) requires a lawyer to furnish the opposing lawyer with a copy of the proposed order simultaneously with its delivery to the judge and, if the proposed order is furnished to the opposing counsel simultaneously,\n   <em>\n    Rule 3.3(d) requires the lawyer to disclose to the judge in the ex parte communication that the opposing lawyer has received a copy of the proposed order but has not had an opportunity to present any comments or objections to the judge.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   (Emphases added.) This opinion thus anticipates that a party will have an opportunity to\n   present comments and objections regarding the draft order to the judge. To sanction an attorney for presenting such comments or objections in a letter rather than some formal document would seem to elevate form over substance, especially in light of our holding in this case that such letters are subject to Rule 11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   In short, to the extent that Mr. Ballinger's letters were responding to Mr. Dunn's proposed order, we hold that they did not violate 98 Formal Ethics Op. 13. Nevertheless, Judge Craig was free to conclude, as he did, that they were unprofessional for other reasons, such as violating Rule 11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   We reach a different conclusion with respect to Mr. Ballinger's 15 August and 6 September 2004 letters. Those letters attempted to introduce new evidence, reargue the merits of the case, and cast Mr. Dunn in a bad light. They are precisely the type of communication 98 Formal Ethics Op. 13 described as risking improper influence upon a tribunal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   98 Formal Ethics Op. 13 (\"[I]nformal\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   written communications, whether addressed directly to the judge or copied to the judge as in this inquiry, may be used as an opportunity to introduce new evidence, to argue the merits of the case, or to cast the opposing party or counsel in a bad light.\"). Judge Craig did not, therefore, err in concluding that these letters violated the Revised Rules of Professional Conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Judge Craig also concluded that Mr. Ballinger violated Rule 1.7(a)(1) and Rule 1.8(g) of the Revised Rules of Professional Conduct. Rule 1.7(a) provides that \"a lawyer shall not represent a client if the representation involves a concurrent conflict of interest.\" Rule 1.8(g) provides that \"[a] lawyer who represents two or more clients shall not participate in making an aggregate settlement of the claims of or against the clients, ... unless each client gives informed consent, in a writing signed by the client.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   We agree with Mr. Ballinger that the record contains no evidence suggesting that Mr. Ballinger's representation of several of the Canoy children involved a concurrent conflict of interest or that he failed to have the necessary informed consent from his clients regarding the aggregate settlement. Nor do those findings of fact not assigned as error support the conclusion that Mr. Ballinger violated these provisions of the Rules of Professional Conduct. Judge Craig appeared to be focusing on Mr. Ballinger's conduct during the September hearings, but that conduct does not necessarily violate Rule 1.7(a) or Rule 1.8(g).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   Judge Craig, however, also concluded that Mr. Ballinger violated Rule 8.4(d), which provides that it is professional misconduct for a lawyer to \"engage in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice.\" Judge Craig's numerous findings regarding Mr. Ballinger's letters, his attempts \"to reopen virtually all of the points of contention ... that had been laid to rest during the negotiation of the settlement on June 10,\" and Mr. Ballinger's behavior at the hearings provide ample support for Judge Craig's conclusion that Mr. Ballinger violated this rule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   In sum, with respect to the imposition of sanctions under the trial court's inherent powers, we conclude that Judge Craig erred when he determined that Mr. Ballinger's 15 and 16 June 2004 letters violated 98 Formal Ethics Op. 13 and that Mr. Ballinger's representation violated Revised Rules of Professional Conduct 1.7(a)(1) and 1.8(g). We conclude Judge Craig did not err, however, when he concluded that Mr. Ballinger's 15 August and 6 September 2004 letters violated 98 Formal Ethics Op. 13 and that Mr. Ballinger's conduct violated Revised Rule of Professional Conduct 8.4(d).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Although \"`questions of propriety and ethics are ordinarily for the consideration of the [North Carolina State] Bar' because that organization was expressly created by the legislature to deal with such questions, ... the power to regulate the conduct of attorneys is held concurrently by the Bar and the court.\"\n   <em>\n    Gardner v.

The order on appeal does not explain why the figure of $5,000.00 was selected or why the trial court considered it an appropriate sanction.

Nowhere in the order does the trial court identify this sanction as \"a purely punitive sanction,\" if that was indeed the trial court's intent.

We held that failure to promptly serve a complaint and summons was not a violation within the scope of Rule 11, and the trial court's imposition of sanctions, which included these violations, was not properly imposed.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"142\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=482%20S.E.2d%20740\">\n     Id.,\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11871645\" index=\"143\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc-app/125/732/#p735\">\n    125 N.C.App. at 735\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"144\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=482%20S.E.2d%20740\">\n    482 S.E.2d at 742\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Remand was necessary to separate a proper sanction from an improper sanction. We reasoned:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   The trial court's order states that it arrived at the appropriate monetary sanction imposed upon plaintiff by generally considering,\n   <em>\n    inter alia,\n   </em>\n   the severity of the violations and the amount necessary to deter further misconduct. Since the trial court did not impose separate sanctions for each type of misconduct, it is impossible for us to determine how much of the $8,500.00 in monetary sanctions stemmed from the trial court's improper sanctioning of plaintiff for his actions in serving the summons and complaint. For this reason, we remand this matter to the trial court for a new hearing to determine the appropriate amount of sanctions to be imposed under Rule 11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"145\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=482%20S.E.2d%20740\">\n     Id.,\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11871645\" index=\"146\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc-app/125/732/#p735\">\n    125 N.C.App. at 735\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"147\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=482%20S.E.2d%20740\">\n    482 S.E.2d at 742-43\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   In the case before us, the majority has determined that the order contained adequate findings of fact to support the imposition of sanctions. Specifically, the trial court\n   found that Ballinger did not obtain the consent of the parties before mailing letters along with an unsolicited draft of the consent judgment to the judge. Also, Ballinger wrote additional letters to the court refusing to sign the consent judgment prepared by Mr. Dunn. In the letters, Mr. Ballinger also attempted to readdress issues that had been resolved in open court when his clients gave their consent to the settlement. Ballinger again mailed a letter in which he refused to sign any consent agreement. During a 16 September 2004 hearing, Ballinger stated that he had not \"at any time refused to consent to the judgment and will sign the thing today.\" Ballinger then proceeded to sign the consent order on behalf of his clients, but withdrew his signature when he was informed by the court that signing the order would create a conflict of interest between him and his clients.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   The trial court's findings of fact demonstrate the severity of Ballinger's rule violations and these same findings are sufficient to support a finding that the sanction in this case was properly imposed. Additionally, the trial judge explained in his order his reason for imposing a $5,000.00 sanction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   The Court has considered the full panoply of options available to it in considering whether to impose sanctions against Mr. Ballinger, including the lesser sanctions of reprimand or censure, and running to more severe sanctions such as the suspension of Mr. Ballinger's law license or substantial monetary penalties of up to $10,000. The Court concludes, in its discretion, that a monetary sanction of $5,000 is appropriate under Rule 11 and the Court's inherent authority over proceedings to punish Mr. Ballinger for his misconduct....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   The findings made by the trial court and the reasoning in support of imposing a sanction are not manifestly unsupported by reason or so arbitrary that they could not have been the result of a reasoned decision. On the contrary, the trial court's reasoning is sufficient to allow us to determine that sufficient findings of fact support the sanction imposed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   Since I believe the majority's decision requiring the court to make specific findings of fact as to the\n   <em>\n    amount\n   </em>\n   of a punitive sanction is not required by our statutes or case law, I respectfully dissent on this issue.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
