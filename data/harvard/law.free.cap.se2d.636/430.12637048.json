RUSSELL.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This appeal requires us to construe the language of Code \u00a7 19.2-295.1 concerning bifurcated trials in criminal cases. It presents the question whether the Commonwealth may, at the sentencing stage of a bifurcated trial, present evidence of the sentences imposed upon the defendant as a part of his record of prior convictions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <em>\n    Facts and Proceedings\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In a jury trial, Robert Lewis Gillispie\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   was found guilty of statutory burglary. The jury fixed his punishment at five years imprisonment. After considering a pre-sentence report, the trial court imposed that sentence, to be followed by three years of post-release probation supervision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   At the sentencing stage of the trial, the Commonwealth offered an authenticated copy of a \"Conviction and Sentencing Order\" entered in the same court, dated December 8, 1998, showing that Gillispie had been convicted of grand larceny and sentenced to five years imprisonment, with three years and four months suspended upon the condition that Gillispie be of good behavior and submit to drug treatment. The order also showed that Gillispie had been charged with robbery but found not guilty of that offense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Defense counsel objected to the exhibit as offered and moved the trial court to redact any reference to the robbery charge. The Commonwealth agreed and the trial court redacted that portion of the order. The defense also moved the court to redact the sentencing information relating to the grand larceny charge, as well as any reference to drug treatment, on the ground that both were \"prejudicial to this case and could inflame the jury.\" The Commonwealth opposed the motion and the court denied it. The 1998 order was admitted in evidence without change except for the redaction of the reference to the robbery charge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   After this evidence was received, the jury retired to consider sentencing. During its deliberations, the jury sent written questions to the trial court, inquiring whether the judge could reduce the sentence the jury fixed, whether the defendant had been on probation when the crime occurred, and in what facility the defendant would be confined if imprisoned. The jury explained, in the last question, \"We don't want this defendant to spend time in penitentiary w/murderers &amp; rapists.\" The court answered these questions properly, by replying that the jurors should fix a sentence they considered appropriate and not concern themselves with future events, that they should not consider the defendant's probation status, and that the Department of Corrections, not the court or the jury, determines where prisoners are housed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   After the jury reported that it had reached a verdict and returned to the courtroom, a juror asked the judge whether suspension and parole were different, and if the judge made the decision whether to suspend a sentence. The court answered both these questions in the affirmative, and asked all jurors whether, in the light of those answers, they were satisfied with the verdict they had reached or whether they wished to retire to the jury room for further deliberations. The jurors unanimously stated that they were satisfied and presented their verdict.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Gillispie appealed his conviction and sentence to the Court of Appeals, which affirmed by a\n   <em>\n    per curiam\n   </em>\n   opinion. We awarded him an appeal, limited to his assignment of error relating to the trial court's refusal to redact sentencing information from his record of prior convictions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <em>\n    Analysis\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Code \u00a7 19.2-295.1 provides, in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In cases of trial by jury, upon a finding that the defendant is guilty of a felony or a Class 1 misdemeanor . . . a separate proceeding limited to the ascertainment of punishment shall be held as soon as practicable\n   before the same jury. At such proceeding, the Commonwealth shall present the defendant's prior criminal convictions by certified, attested or exemplified copies of the record of conviction. . . . After the Commonwealth has introduced such evidence of prior convictions, or if no such evidence is introduced, the defendant may introduce relevant, admissible evidence related to punishment. Nothing in this section shall prevent the Commonwealth or the defendant from introducing relevant, admissible evidence in rebuttal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In denying Gillispie's appeal on this issue, the Court of Appeals followed its prior decisions in\n   <em>\n    Gilliam v.

We agree that an ambiguity exists, as illustrated by the positions of the parties here: The defendant contends that \"record of conviction\" means a document showing only the fact of conviction; the Commonwealth contends that the term refers to the final order entered by the trial court, typically showing both conviction and sentence. Nevertheless, we reach a different conclusion from that reached by the Court of Appeals as to the intent of the General Assembly in enacting Code \u00a7 19.2-295.1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The General Assembly adopted Code \u00a7 19.2-295.1 in its original form in 1994. At that time, bifurcated trials in capital murder cases were provided for by Code \u00a7\u00a7 19.2-264.2,\n   <em>\n    et seq.,\n   </em>\n   which had been in effect in varying forms since 1977. The General Assembly clearly had those laws in contemplation in 1994, when considering the extension of bifurcated trials to non-capital felonies for the first time in our history. Code \u00a7 19.2-264.2 provided then, as it does now, that the jury, at the penalty phase of a capital murder case, shall not impose the death penalty unless it finds either the \"future dangerousness\" predicate or the \"vileness\" predicate to exist \"after consideration of the past criminal record of convictions of the defendant.\" Code \u00a7 19.2-264.4(C) provided then, as it does now, that in the penalty phase of a capital murder trial, evidence may be admissible, subject to the rules of evidence, that includes the \"prior history\" of the defendant.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In ascertaining legislative intent, we presume that the General Assembly, when enacting new laws, is fully aware of the state of existing law relating to the same general subject matter.\n   <em>\n    United Masonry, Inc. v.

There, we held that the sentences imposed as a result of the defendant's prior convictions might properly be admitted at the penalty phase of a capital murder trial, observing: \"The sentence reflects the gravity of the offense and the offender's propensity for violence.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=284%20S.E.2d%20844\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In the light of our interpretation of the capital murder statutes in\n   <em>\n    Bassett,\n   </em>\n   the General Assembly, if it had desired the same result in non-capital felony trials, could simply have mirrored the capital murder laws when enacting Code \u00a7 19.2-295.1. Instead, it employed more restrictive language than it had used in the capital murder laws, limiting the Commonwealth to the introduction of \"the defendant's prior criminal\n   <em>\n    convictions\n   </em>\n   \" by presenting copies of the \"record of\n   <em>\n    conviction\n   </em>\n   .\" (Emphasis added.) Section 19.2-295.1 was enacted without any provisions permitting the introduction of evidence of prior sentences as a part of the defendant's \"history and background\" in the Commonwealth's case in chief at the penalty phase. By contrast, the Commonwealth may do just that in capital murder cases, relying on our interpretation in\n   <em>\n    Bassett.\n   </em>\n   The General Assembly had an opportunity to make bifurcated trials in non-capital cases similar to those in capital cases, but chose a different course.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   We consider the General Assembly's departure from the language it had used in enacting the capital murder laws to be a significant demonstration of a legislative intent to accomplish a different result with respect to non-capital cases. We therefore construe the words \"prior criminal convictions\" and \"record of conviction,\" as employed in Code \u00a7 19.2-295.1 to mean exactly what they say, and no more.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Thus, in the Commonwealth's case in chief at the penalty phase of the trial of a non-capital felony or a Class 1 misdemeanor, the Commonwealth is required to introduce evidence, as prescribed by the statute, of records showing only the fact of conviction of a criminal offense, including the name of the crime, the date of the conviction and the court in which the conviction occurred. If the record contains information concerning proceedings subsequent to conviction, such as sentence, suspension, probation or other rehabilitative efforts, such information should be redacted before the record is received in evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In the present appeal, the Commonwealth relies on our language in\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth v. Shifflett,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"875340\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va/257/34/#p43\">\n    257 Va. 34\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 43,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=510%20S.E.2d%20232\">\n    510 S.E.2d 232\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 236 (1999):\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   We perceive no sound reason why the factors that may be considered by a jury in capital murder cases should not likewise be available for consideration by a jury in noncapital cases under \u00a7 19.2-295.1. The goal of having an informed jury assess appropriate punishment should be no less essential merely because a noncapital offense is involved.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The Commonwealth's reliance on\n   <em>\n    Shifflett\n   </em>\n   is misplaced. That case dealt with the obverse aspect of Code \u00a7 19.2-295.1, the question of what evidence the\n   <em>\n    defendant\n   </em>\n   may introduce at the penalty phase of a bifurcated non-capital felony trial. In \u00a7 19.2-295.1, the General Assembly imposed no such limitations on the defendant's evidence as it had placed upon the Commonwealth. While limiting the Commonwealth to \"prior criminal convictions,\" the statute expressly provides that the defendant \"may introduce relevant, admissible evidence related to punishment.\" It was that language that we construed in\n   <em>\n    Shifflett,\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   when we held that the trial court's decision as to relevancy would only be set aside for a clear abuse of discretion.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 44,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=510%20S.E.2d%20232\">\n    510 S.E.2d 232\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=510%20S.E.2d%20232\">\n    510 S.E.2d at 237\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . For\n   that reason, nothing we decide here is inconsistent with our holding in\n   <em>\n    Shifflett.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   It is conceivable that a defendant may, for his own purposes, wish to offer sentencing information at the penalty phase, and in our view of the statute, he would be free to do so. Further, as we observed in\n   <em>\n    Shifflett,\n   </em>\n   the statute is a two-way street. The Commonwealth as well as the defendant may introduce \"relevant, admissible evidence in rebuttal.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 43-44,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=510%20S.E.2d%20232\">\n    510 S.E.2d at 236\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, the Commonwealth may introduce evidence of sentencing and prior efforts to rehabilitate if the court, in its discretion, deems it relevant and admissible to rebut evidence the defendant has introduced at the penalty phase.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <em>\n    Conclusion\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Because the Court of Appeals erred in holding that the sentencing information was properly admitted in the Commonwealth's case in chief at the penalty phase of the trial, we will reverse the judgment appealed from and remand the case to the Court of Appeals for further remand to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion, limited to the issue of sentencing, pursuant to the provisions of Code \u00a7 19.2-295.1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <em>\n    Reversed and remanded.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1.\">\n   <p id=\"p-38\">\n    The defendant was indicted as \"Robert Lewis Gillespie AKA Robert Lewis Gillispi.\" He was sentenced by the trial court as \"Robert Lewis Gillespie a/k/a Robert Lewis Gillispie\" and that style was used in all subsequent proceedings in the Court of Appeals and in this Court.

It is axiomatic that we cannot presume that the General Assembly, in enacting Code \u00a7 19.2-295.1, relied on our interpretation of statutory language in\n   <em>\n    Bassett\n   </em>\n   when we never undertook any such interpretation in the first place.

The plain language of Code \u00a7 19.2-295.1 requires the Commonwealth to present \"the defendant's prior criminal convictions by certified, attested or exemplified copies of the record of conviction.\" Our decisions recognize the term \"conviction\" often embraces more than a jury's verdict finding a defendant guilty.

The majority concludes, however, that the Commonwealth can introduce \"only the fact of conviction of a criminal offense, including the name of the crime, the date of the conviction and the court in which the conviction occurred.\" To comply with the majority's holding, redaction of a significant portion of information set forth in judgments of conviction, which are the most common and reliable documentation of a defendant's \"record of conviction,\" will be required as a matter of course.

If, upon such an examination, an interpretation can be made, consistent with the language used, which will carry into effect the object sought to be accomplished by the statute, that interpretation should be adopted, in preference to one which would be equally consistent with the language used, standing alone, but which would defeat, or tend to defeat, the manifest intent of the legislature.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <em>\n    Harris v.
