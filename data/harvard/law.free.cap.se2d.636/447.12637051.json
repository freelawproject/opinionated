STEVEN AGEE.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Jay Tronfeld appeals from the judgment of the Circuit Court of the City of Petersburg sustaining a demurrer on behalf of the defendants, Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company (\"Nationwide\") and Todd Schmitt (collectively, the \"Defendants\"). On appeal, Tronfeld asserts the trial court erred in finding that the alleged statements were opinion and thus not actionable under Virginia law as defamation per se. For the reasons set forth below, we will reverse the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I. BACKGROUND AND MATERIAL PROCEEDINGS BELOW\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Nationwide employed Schmitt as an insurance adjuster. In February 2005, Schmitt, acting within the scope of his employment with Nationwide, met with Donald Spellman to discuss an injury that Spellman sustained from an accident with an insured of Nationwide. During this meeting, Schmitt and Spellman discussed settlement of the personal injury claim and whether the settlement could be completed without the intervention of an attorney.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   During the meeting, they discussed the possible selection of an attorney to serve as counsel for Spellman in his claim against Nationwide. In response to Spellman selecting Tronfeld as his counsel, Schmitt made these statements (\"Schmitt's statements\"):\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   (1) That Jay Tronfeld just takes peoples' money.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   (2) That clients of Jay Tronfeld would receive more money [for their claims] if they had not hired Jay and had dealt with the adjuster [directly].\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   At the time of the alleged statements, Tronfeld actively engaged in the practice of law and operated the law firm Jay Tronfeld &amp; Associates. Tronfeld's law practice primarily involved the representation of private individuals in personal injury matters, and his firm used extensive marketing through print, radio and television to attract clients.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Tronfeld filed an amended motion for judgment in the Circuit Court of the City of Petersburg, alleging that the statements made by Schmitt were defamation\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   because the statements impute \"Tronfeld as unfit to perform the duties of his employment\" and that he \"lacks integrity and is dishonest in performing the duties of his employment.\" As a consequence, Tronfeld alleges he was prejudiced \"in his work and chosen profession\" as an attorney. The Defendants filed a demurrer, contending Schmitt's statements were expressions of opinion and therefore could not be the basis for a cause of action for defamation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In a hearing on the demurrer, the trial court ruled from the bench that Schmitt's statements were \"expressions of opinion\" and that the demurrer should be sustained. On November 15, 2005, the trial court entered a final order sustaining the demurrer. We awarded Tronfeld this appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   II.

As such, Schmitt's statements \"impute to [Tronfeld] the commission of some criminal offense involving moral turpitude,\" and \"impute to [Tronfeld] unfitness to perform the duties of . . . employment . . . or want of integrity in the discharge of the duties of such . . . employment.\"\n   <em>\n    Fleming,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2138779\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va/221/884/#p889\">\n    221 Va. at 889\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=275%20S.E.2d%20632\">\n    275 S.E.2d at 635\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   For these reasons, the trial court erred in sustaining the demurrer of the Defendants because Schmitt's statements are capable of \"a provably false factual connotation\" and are thus not opinion.\n   <em>\n    Yeagle,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"513181\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va/255/293/#p295\">\n    255 Va. at 295\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=497%20S.E.2d%20136\">\n    497 S.E.2d at 137\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    accord Fuste,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4206552\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va/265/127/#p132\">\n    265 Va. at 133\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=575%20S.E.2d%20858\">\n    575 S.E.2d at 862\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    WJLA-TV v.

As Schmitt's statements could prejudice Tronfeld in his profession, those statements do support a cause of action for defamation per se under Virginia law. Accordingly, we will reverse the judgment of the trial court and will remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <em>\n    Reversed and remanded.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1.\">\n   <p id=\"p-42\">\n    Tronfeld concedes on appeal that a third statement by Schmitt, \"that Jay Tronfeld was no good,\" is a statement of opinion and thus not actionable in a cause of action for defamation. Therefore, this statement is not at issue in this appeal and we do not consider it.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
