STEVEN AGEE.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Betty Kersey Haley appeals from the judgment of the Circuit Court of Lee County sustaining a demurrer to her amended bill of complaint and petition for contribution. At issue in this appeal is whether the trial court erred in finding that Haley failed to comply with the requirements of Code \u00a7 64.1-13 in order to claim an elective share of her deceased husband's estate. For the reasons set forth below, we will affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I. BACKGROUND AND MATERIAL PROCEEDINGS BELOW\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Hoover Clifton Haley (\"H.C.\") died intestate on October 22, 2003. Surviving H.C. were his widow, Betty Kersey Haley (\"Haley\"), and his son from a previous marriage, James Clifton Haley (\"James\"). Haley qualified as the administrator of H.C.'s estate on December 22, 2003. On February 12, 2004, a document was filed in the clerk's office of the trial court claiming an elective share for Haley in H.C.'s estate (\"the February 12th document\"). The February 12th document showed the following typed words in a signature block at the end of the document: \"Betty Kersey Haley / By Counsel /______ / Lonnie L. Kern\" and was signed by Mr. Kern as Haley's attorney. The February 12th document did not contain Haley's personal signature and was not acknowledged.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Haley filed a petition for contribution and bill of complaint to enforce her claim to the elective share. James filed a demurrer, asserting that Haley's claim to an elective share was ineffective because the February 12th document failed to meet the requirements of Code \u00a7 64.1-13 in that it was not personally executed by the claimant and failed to contain the acknowledgment required by the statute. By order dated December 30, 2004, the trial court sustained James' demurrer, but granted Haley leave to file an amended bill of complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Haley filed a new election for elective share, personally executed by her and properly acknowledged by a notary public, on January 28, 2005. That same day, she filed an amended bill of complaint and petition for contribution to enforce her right to an elective share. James again demurred because \"the amended claim to [an] elective share was, and can be of no legal effect, not having been filed within six (6) months of plaintiff's qualification as administrator of the H.C. Haley intestate estate as required by Code \u00a7 64.1-13.\" By order dated August 18, 2005, the trial court sustained James' demurrer, finding:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   the [February 12, 2004] writing filed on behalf of [Haley] was ineffective as a claim to the elective share in that it was neither signed nor acknowledged by [Haley] as required by \u00a7 64.1-13 of the Code of Virginia [and, therefore,] no effective claim to the elective share was filed within six months of [Haley's] qualification as administrator of [H.C.'s] estate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   We awarded Haley this appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   II. ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Haley alleges the trial court erred because the requirements of Code \u00a7 64.1-13 were \"substantially met\" when Haley's attorney \"signed as her agent the election for her share\" in H.C.'s estate and James \"received actual notice of Mrs. Haley's Election.\" Haley contends that because the uncontroverted evidence showed her attorney signed the February 12th document with her \"permission and authorization,\" the attorney's signature satisfied the requirements of Code \u00a7 64.1-13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   James responds that the text of Code \u00a7 64.1-13 is \"clear and unambiguous,\" permitting a surviving spouse to claim an elective share \"in person before the court having jurisdiction ... or by writing recorded ... upon proper acknowledgement or proof.\" James asserts the February 12th document failed to comply with this requirement because it was neither personally signed by Haley nor acknowledged. In addition, James contends that whether he received \"actual notice\" of Haley's election is irrelevant to determining whether Haley satisfied the requirements for claiming an elective share.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Statutory interpretation is a \"pure question of law subject to de novo review by this Court.\"\n   <em>\n    Virginia Polytechnic Inst. &amp; State Univ. v.

The February 12th document does not bear the requisite acknowledgment or proof to be admitted to record under Code \u00a7 55-106. As a matter of law, the February 12th document was thus ineffective to make a claim of an elective share because it failed to comply with the Code \u00a7 64.1-13 acknowledgement requirement. The later filing on January 28, 2005 was also ineffective because it was not filed within the six-month time period required by Code \u00a7 64.1-13 and therefore also fails as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Contrary to Haley's argument, \"actual notice\" and substantial compliance are not sufficient to satisfy the requirements for claiming an elective share under Code \u00a7 64.1-13. The clear and unambiguous requirements of Code \u00a7 64.1-13 are mandatory. The rationale we noted in the analogous context of the written notice requirement in Code \u00a7 8.01-222, applies with equal strength here:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   unless the legislature makes exceptions to cover circumstances not specifically stated in the statute, such exceptions do not exist.... The arbitrary and peremptory provisions of the statute are necessary to accomplish the purposes of the enactment.... For this Court to place any limitation on the clear and comprehensive language of the statute, or to create an exception where none exists under the guise of statutory construction, would be to defeat the purpose of the enactment and to engage in judicial legislation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Town of\n   <em>\n    Crewe v.

Code \u00a7 64.1-13 sets forth the means for claiming an elective share, and requires the election to be acknowledged. To permit \"actual notice\" to suffice would create an exception that has no basis in the text of the statute. Accordingly, actual notice does not satisfy the requirements for claiming an elective share under Code \u00a7 64.1-13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The trial court thus did not err in finding that Haley's attempts to claim an elective share did not satisfy the requirements of Code \u00a7 64.1-13 and in sustaining the\n   demurrer.\n   <footnotemark>\n    *\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, we will affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <em>\n    Affirmed.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"*\">\n   <p id=\"p-29\">\n    Because we find no error in the trial court's ruling that the February 12, 2004 document fails to satisfy the requirements of Code \u00a7 64.1-13 because it does not contain an acknowledgment or proof, we need not address Haley's argument that an attorney can make a claim of an election under Code \u00a7 64.1-13 for his or her client and express no opinion in that regard.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
