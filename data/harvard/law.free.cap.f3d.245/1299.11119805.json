Hall purchased two Nike pendants, one from each of the plaintiffs-appellees Tammy D. Scarbrough and Carol C. Davis, employees of Marion Douglas, who owned the booth.</p>\n<p id=\"b1339-19\">Hall showed the pendants to Holder, who verified that they bore unauthorized trademarks.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Hall later averred that he determined that this verification by Holder, in conjunction with Scarbrough and Davis\u2019s sale of cheaply priced goods bearing unauthorized trademarks, which were in proximity to other booths selling goods with unauthorized trademarks, was sufficient probable cause for their arrests. Hall subsequently returned to the booth, arrested Scarbrough and Davis, and handcuffed them together while he arrested other sellers of counterfeit goods. Scarb-rough, Davis, and the other arrestees were transported to Mobile Police Headquarters and then to Mobile Metro Jail. Their employer, Douglas, posted bond, and they were released that night.</p>\n<p id=\"b1339-20\">At the preliminary hearing on June 19, 1997, Myles testified that Nike, Inc. had advised in a letter that such items were being sold, which was the basis for the investigation.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Based on this evidence, the state judge determined that there was probable cause to bind Scarbrough and Davis over to the grand jury. ' The charges <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1302\">*1302</page-number>against them subsequently were no billed by the grand jury. Scarbrough and Davis then filed this 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 action and alleged that the City of Mobile, Myles, and Hall falsely had arrested and/or imprisoned them and maliciously had prosecuted them.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The district judge denied qualified immunity to Hall for his arrests of Scarb-rough and Davis and to Myles for his testimony at the preliminary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1340-4\">We review <em>de novo </em>the denial of qualified or absolute immunity. <em>Jones v. Cannon, </em>174 F.3d 1271, 1281 (11th Cir.1999). Qualified immunity generally shields \u00a7 1983 government defendants from liability, provided that \u201ctheir conduct violates no \u2018clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.\u2019 \u201d <em>Lassiter v. Alabama A&amp;M Univ., </em>28 F.3d 1146, 1149 (11th Cir.1994) (en banc) (quoting <em>Harlow v. Fitzgerald, </em>457 U.S. 800, 818, 102 S.Ct. 2727, 2738, 73 L.Ed.2d 396 (1982)). Because qualified immunity is the \u201cusual rule\u201d for government actors sued in their individual capacities, it will shield them unless case law establishes a bright line in \u201ca concrete and factually defined context\u201d that makes a violation of federal law obvious. <em>Id. </em>\u201cThus, a police officer is entitled to qualified immunity if a reasonable police officer could have believed his or her actions were lawful in light of clearly established law and the information possessed by the officer at the time the conduct occurred.\u201d <em>Jackson v. Sauls, </em>206 F.3d 1156, 1165 (11th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b1340-10\">Prior to consulting with Holder, Hall determined that he had probable cause to arrest Scarbrough and Davis based on three factors: (1) each had sold him an unlawful Nike pendant, (2) in his opinion, the price of the pendants was below what he would have expected a similar, legitimate item to cost,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and (3) numerous other sellers were engaged in selling trademark-infringing items near Scarbrough and Davis.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The fact that the pendants that Scarbrough and Davis sold to Hall infringed Nike\u2019s trademark was confirmed by Holder and is undisputed. Significantly, all that is required for qualified immunity to be applicable to an arresting officer is <em>\u201carguable </em>probable cause to believe that a person is committing a particular public offense,\u201d <em>Redd v. City of Enterprise, </em>140 F.3d 1378, 1384 (11th Cir.1998); \u201cthat is, where \u2018reasonable officers in the same circumstances and possessing the same knowledge as the Defendants could have believed that probable cause existed to arrest\u2019 the plaintiffs,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 1382 (citation omitted). <em>See Jones, </em>174 F.3d at 1283 n. 3 (\u201cArguable probable cause, not the higher standard of actual probable cause, governs the qualified immunity inquiry.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1340-11\">The district judge denied Hall qualified immunity, however, because Holder subsequently told Hall that he should reconsider the arrests because he had not obtained admissions from Scarbrough and Davis that they knew that the pendants infringed Nike\u2019s trademark before he arrested them.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Arguable proba<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1303\">*1303</page-number>ble cause does not require an arresting officer to prove every element of a crime or to obtain a confession before making an arrest, which would negate the concept of probable cause and transform arresting officers into prosecutors.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We have no clearly established law that places such a burden on Hall as the arresting officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b1341-5\">Additionally, qualified immunity is analyzed under a standard of \u201c[objective legal reasonableness.\u201d <em>Lassiter, </em>28 F.3d at 1150; <em>see Jackson, </em>206 F.3d at 1165. Our inquiry is whether Hall, an experienced investigating officer concerning the sale of trademark-infringing goods, had sufficient objective evidence to make the arrests of Scarbrough and Davis and not Holder\u2019s opinion or view of the state law subsequent to the arrests. <em>See Lassiter, </em>28 F.3d at 1150 (recognizing that \u201cqualified immunity is a doctrine of practical application to real-life situations\u201d at the time the government conduct occurred and is not evaluated \u201cby hindsight, based on later events\u201d). Because Hall had arguable probable cause to arrest Scarbrough and Davis, he violated no clearly established law and is entitled to qualified immunity.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1342-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1304\">*1304</page-number>The district judge denied immunity to Myles, who was not involved in the arrests of Scarbrough and Davis, because he concluded that there were material questions as to whether, in his testimony at the preliminary hearing, Myles \u201cdeliberately lied about the existence of a letter from Nike warning against the sale of unauthorized merchandise in a effort to establish probable cause otherwise lacking for the arrest of the plaintiffs.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> R2-29-8. At the state preliminary hearing, where probable cause for the arrests was addressed, Myles testified that a letter warning vendors to cease selling items bearing infringing trademarks, sent by Nike, Inc. and other trademark holders, was posted obviously at the Mobile Flea Market.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Scarbrough and Davis contend that Myles\u2019s testimony regarding the let<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1305\">*1305</page-number>ter was intentionally false to establish probable cause for the arrests, and the district judge seemed influenced by this reasoning. Myles, however, was not the arresting officer and did not need to establish probable cause for his conduct. He testified as a witness concerning his memory of the contents of the letter posted at the flea market, which warned vendors to stop selling trademark-infringing goods.</p>\n<p id=\"b1343-5\">In \u00a7 1983 cases, absolute immunity is accorded \u201cto functions \u2018intimately associated with the judicial phase of the criminal process.\u2019 \u201d <em>Jones, </em>174 F.3d at 1281 (quoting <em>Malley v. Briggs, </em>475 U.S. 335, 342, 106 S.Ct. 1092, 1097, 89 L.Ed.2d 271 (1986)). A preliminary hearing in Alabama is a judicial proceeding to determine probable cause. <em>DeFries v. State, </em>597 So.2d 742, 744 (Ala.Crim.App.1992); Ala. Code \u00a7 15-11-1; <em>see Ex Parte Wood, </em>629 So.2d 808, 811 (Ala.Crim.App.1993) (recognizing that a preliminary hearing is a critical stage in the criminal process where a defendant has the right to counsel). Police officers have the same absolute immunity as lay witnesses in testifying at trial or before a grand jury.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>Jones, </em>174 F.3d at 1281. As with any witness testifying under oath, the penalty for false testimony is potential prosecution for perjury.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <em>Briscoe v. LaHue, </em>460 U.S. 325, 342, 103 S.Ct. 1108, 1119, 75 L.Ed.2d 96 (1983); <em>Jones, </em>174 F.3d at 1281. Because a preliminary hearing is a judicial proceeding, Myles enjoys absolute immunity from civil liability damages resulting from his testimony. <em>See Williams v. Hepting, </em>844 F.2d 138, 143 (3d Cir.1988) (holding that a witness who testified at a preliminary criminal hearing in state court would be entitled to absolute immunity from liability in a subsequent civil rights suit for damages based on alleged perjured testimony during that proceeding). He also has absolute immunity from state-law claims. <em>See Cutts v. American United Life Ins. Co., </em>505 So.2d 1211 (Ala.1987) (\u201cAbsolute privilege exists in favor of those involved in judicial proceedings, including ... witnesses.... \u201d). Consequently, Myles is entitled to absolute immunity for his testimony at the preliminary hearing.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1344-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1306\">*1306</page-number>Accordingly, we REVERSE the district judge\u2019s denial of qualified immunity to Hall and Myles and REMAND with instructions to grant qualified immunity to Hall and absolute immunity to Myles.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1339-16\">. This case originally was filed in the Circuit Court of Mobile County and was removed to federal court for the Southern District of Alabama, which exercised supplemental jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367 over the state-law causes of action.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1339-17\">. Although denied by Hall, Scarbrough and Davis contend that Holder subsequently advised Hall that he should reconsider arresting Scarbrough and Davis because the Alabama statute requires knowledge, and \"they did not admit knowing the jewelry was unauthorized.\" R2-29-3 n. 2.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1339-22\">.Scarbrough and Davis have challenged the existence of this letter.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1340-5\">.

Rl-20-Exh.7 at 10 (Hall's testimony at the preliminary hearing).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1340-9\">. Hall also testified at the preliminary hearing that the reason for the officers' investigation of illegal sales at the Mobile Flea Market on April 6, 1997, was in response to telephone calls reporting sales of unlawful items bearing infringing trademarks at the flea market. <em>Id. </em>at 14.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1340-13\">.Under Alabama law, it is a Class C felony to copy or reproduce a trademark for a commercial purpose knowing that the trademark has been used without the owner's consent.

Our inquiry in qualified-immunity analysis is whether the government actor\u2019s conduct violated clearly established law and not whether an arrestee's conduct is a crime or ultimately will result in conviction. Police officers are not expected to be lawyers or prosecutors. <em>See Lassiter, </em>28 F.3d at 1152 n. 8 (recognizing that it is \" \u2018unfair and impracticable\u2019 to hold public officials to the same level of knowledge as trained lawyers\u201d) (quoting Davis v. <em>Scherer, </em>468 U.S. 183, 196 n. 13, 104 S.Ct. 3012, 3020 n. 13, 82 L.Ed.2d 139 (1984)). The district judge focused on the arrestees instead of the arresting officer in his decision to deny Hall qualified immunity. The issue should have been whether Hall violated clearly established law in making the arrests based on the objective factors that gave rise to his probable-cause determination and not whether the arrestees\u2019 actions actually constituted a crime.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b1341-7\">. We note that the district judge determined in the same order that there was no evidence that the arrests precluded discretionary-function immunity, which Alabama law extends to municipal police officers unless their conduct, is willful, malicious, or in bad faith. R2-29-6-7; <em>see </em>Ala.Code \u00a7 6-5-338(a). In addressing discretionary-function immunity and qualified immunity, our court has stated that \"[ujnder both Alabama law and federal law, the core issue is whether a defendant violated clearly established law.\u201d <em>Sheth v. Webster, </em>145 F.3d 1231, 1239 (11th Cir.1998) (per curiam); <em>see Taylor v. Adams, </em>221 F.3d 1254, 1260 n. 9 (11th Cir.2000) (\"Discretionary-function immunity arising under Alabama law is, like qualified immunity arising under federal law, immunity from suit.\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 121 S.Ct. 774, 148 L.Ed.2d 673 (2001). Under discretionary-function-immunity analysis, a court first determines whether the government defendant was performing a discretionary function when the alleged wrong occurred; if so, \"the burden shifts to the plaintiff to demonstrate that the defendant ] acted in bad faith, with malice or willfulness in order to deny [him] immunity.\u201d <em>Sheth, </em>145 F.3d at 1239; <em>see Taylor, </em>221 F.3d at 1261 (\"The [government defendants] are entitled to discretionary-function immunity if, on the summary-judgment facts, their acts at the scene were discretionary and [the plaintiff] has not presented evidence sufficient to create a jury question regarding whether they \u2018acted in bad faith, [or] with malice or willfulness.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Sheth, </em>145 F.3d at 1239) (third alteration in original)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1341-11\">We also have found federal qualified immunity to be more inclusive than Alabama discretionary-function immunity. Although the Alabama Supreme Court has equated qualified immunity with discretionary-function immunity, we have recognized that federal qualified immunity may not be defeated by willfulness, malice, or bad faith. <em>Sheth, </em>145 F.3d at 1240 &amp; n. 8. The district judge correctly concluded that these motivations were not present in this case, which left him with the essential determination of whether clearly established law, known by a reasonable police officer, was violated by Hall in arresting Scarbrough and Davis. <em>See Post v. City of Fort Lauderdale, </em>7 F.3d 1552, 1557 (11th Cir.1993) (\"[T]he burden is on the plaintiff to show that, when the defendant acted, the law established the contours of a right so clearly that a reasonable official <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1304\">*1304</page-number>would have understood his acts were unlawful.\u201d), <em>modified on other grounds, </em>14 F.3d 583 (11th Cir.1994) (per curiam). His qualified-immunity analysis was inconsistent with his discretionary-function-immunity determination and faltered when he changed from this inquiry, based on the objective factors from which Hall determined that he had probable cause for the arrests, to the arrestees\u2019 knowledge that the pendants infringed Nike\u2019s trademark, an element of the crime under state law for which Scarbrough and Davis potentially could have been prosecuted. <em>See Sheth, </em>145 F.3d at 1240; <em>infra </em>n. 8.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b1342-5\">. Rather than analyzing the immunity applicable to Myles under qualified immunity, the district judge should have used absolute immunity, since Myles\u2019s alleged misconduct occurred during his testimony at the state preliminary hearing, and absolute immunity was pled as an affirmative defense.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b1342-6\">.

In preserving the integrity of the judicial process, absolute immunity for witnesses minimizes intimidation that might discourage testifying and \"enhances reliability because those who testify will be less likely to. distort their testimony in favor of a future plaintiff in a civil suit for damages.\u201d <em>Strength v. Hubert, </em>854 F.2d 421, 424 (11th Cir.1988) (per curiam); <em>see Holt v. Castaneda, </em>832 F.2d 123, 127 (9th Cir.1987) (\"In adversarial' pretrial proceedings as well as at trial, absolute witness immunity is essential if the truth-seeing function of the proceeding is to be fully served.\u201d). Additionally, absolute immunity serves a purpose for police-officer witnesses that is different from lay witnesses. Police officers testify in numerous cases every year, and defendants often convert resentment for being convicted into allegations of perjury by the state's official witnesses. If a police-officer witness could be made to answer in court each time that a disgruntled defendant charged him with wrongdoing, his energy and attention would be diverted from his responsibilities of enforcing criminal law. 'Consequently, our court rejected the notion that an exception to the doctrine of absolute immunity' for witnesses should exist when a police officer is alleged to have committed perjury during a criminal trial. <em>Jones, </em>174 F.3d at 1287-88. Nevertheless, there is no evidence in the record that Myles testified falsely at the preliminary hearing regarding his recollection of the warning letter posLed at the flea market.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b1343-9\">. The preliminary hearing was adversarial, and Myles's testimony was elicited under oath in open court and was subject to cross-examination under the supervision of the presiding judge as well as criminal prosecution for perjury.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b1343-10\">. Apparently, the district judge was led astray by defense counsel's questioning Myles in state court concerning his knowledge of whether he knew if Scarbrough and Davis knew if selling the Nike pendants was unlaw<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1306\">*1306</page-number>ful. The state judge allowed this questioning over the prosecutor\u2019s objection and stated: \"If he knows, he can answer the question.\u201d Rl-20-Exh. 7 at 18. Thereafter, the following question was asked by defense counsel and answered by Myles: \"Do you have any knowledge, as to whether or not [Scarbrough and Davis] had direct knowledge that the selling of these items would be an illegal act? No, sir.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Again, the district judge's focus was misplaced; it should not have been on Scarbrough and Davis\u2019s knowledge, which is relevant to proof of the crime, because this \u00a7 1983 case concerns the immunities involved in the conduct of the police officers.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
