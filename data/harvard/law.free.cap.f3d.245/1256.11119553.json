The PSI recommended that Ray be given a base offense level of 20 because Ray was previously convicted of a violent crime (burglary), and under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(4)(A) a defendant receives a base level of 20 if \u201cthe defendant had one prior felony conviction of either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense.\u201d The PSI explained that in 1992, Ray was convicted of burglary when he \u201centered Room 156 at the Ramada Inn.... According to the defendant, he was dared by a friend to enter a room where the door had been left open.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1295-16\">That Ray burglarized a hotel room is undisputed. Ray, however, objected to the PSI\u2019s determination that his burglary of a hotel room constituted the burglary of a \u201cdwelling.\u201d The sentencing court adopted the PSI findings and sentenced Ray to 37 months in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b1295-17\">We follow the Third Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. McClenton, </em>53 F.3d 584 (3rd Cir.1995): a hotel guest room \u2014 occupied or not \u2014 constitutes a \u201cdwelling\u201d under the pertinent Guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b1295-18\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
