J. A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"At7\">This action, so far as we need deal with it, was brought in a county district court by the plaintiff, a real estate broker, against the defendants Thomas E. Gill and Eileen A. Gill, his wife, the purchasers of a certain house and lot, which they bought directly from Charles H. Eeid <em>&amp; </em>Sons, Inc., the owner. The theory of the action is that the Gills deliberately induced the owner to believe that no broker was involved in the matter. The case was tried without a jury, and judgment was rendered in favor of the Gills. Plaintiff appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-8\">In February or March 1954 Eeid orally authorized the plaintiff to act as its broker in the sale of the property; besides it listed the property with other brokers and also reserved to itself the right to sell. In the course of its business plaintiff showed the premises to a number of prospective purchasers and on at least two occasions secured a deposit from a purchaser. To Gill it showed the property several times. In August or September 1954 the G\u00fcls gave plaintiff a deposit of $100 and signed a short form binder containing an agreement on their part to buy the place fox $14,500, and also a statement fixing plaintiff\u2019s commission at 5%. Later the Gills induced the plaintiff to refund the $100 and destroy the binder, probably because they could not raise the necessary funds. A month later and (Gill denies this) possibly also in the Christmas holidays, plaintiff showed the Gills the house again. In early 1955 Eeid posted a sign on the premises bearing Eeid\u2019s name and telephone number and stating that the property was for sale. On February 28, 1955 Gill went back (as he admits) <em>for the purpose of looking at the house </em>(incidentally passing plaintiff\u2019s office on the way) and, seeing the sign, called Mrs. Eeid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>directly, making an appointment to inspect the place. In March 1955 the Gills entered into an agreement with Reid for the purchase of the property for $13,750.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-4\">Gill testified that he asked Reid on two occasions whether plaintiff was still concerned with the sale of the property and that Reid\u2019s answer was \u201cno.\u201d He also testified that he felt that due to the interval existing between the time he last contacted the plaintiff and the time he first saw the house with the Reids, plaintiff had no right to commissions. The court itself then interposed, asking him why, if that was his feeling, had he asked Reid whether plaintiff had any interest in the matter. Contradictorily Gill replied that he was \u201cnot that dumb\u201d; he knew plaintiff would be entitled to a commission in view of the fact that it first showed him the house.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">Opposed to these claims of Gill that he inquired of Reid whether plaintiff had an interest in the matter, is the story of Mr. and Mrs. Reid, who were called by plaintiff on rebuttal (they were not parties, and the case had by then been dismissed as against the Reid corporation on the corporation\u2019s motion). The Reids testified that Gill never in any of his dealings referred to the plaintiff. Moreover Mrs. Reid said that when the Gills were shown the house by the Reids on March 1, 1955, they acted as though they were seeing it for the first time. We believe the Reids\u2019 version of the matter, largely because of a subsequent incident. On the day title closed in July 1955 plaintiff first learned of the transaction and forthwith made a claim for commissions. Reid\u2019s attorney then questioned Gill, asking him if he (Gill) had ever told Reid that it was the plaintiff who originally had shown him the house. Gill, when on the stand, testified in effect that to that question he answered \u201cyes.\u201d However, the attorney, called by the plaintiff on rebuttal, contradicted him, saying that Gill then professed that plaintiff had not shown him the house originally. Gill, in giving his testimony, apparently falsified an important part of his story.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">We think it probable, therefore, that the Gills, knowing plaintiff\u2019s interests in the matter, and in order to obtain a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>reduction in the price of the property, purposely took steps to prevent plaintiff from securing a commission. This constitutes a tort. The leading case in the state dealing with the subject is <em>Louis Kamm, Inc., v. Flink, </em>113 <em>N. J. L. </em>582 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1934). Further see <em>McCue v. Deppert, </em>21 <em>N. J. Super. </em>591 <em>(App. Div. </em>1952), and cases cited. It is to be noted that Gill himself arranged with Mrs. Eeid for the inspection of the premises; that Gill and his wife looked through the house in the company of the Eeids, and later he and his father called on Eeid; and that the Gills by their own conduct \u2014 that is, by all these goings on, without the intervention in any way of a broker \u2014 definitely made it appear that they had found their way to the property without the aid of a broker. In addition to that, it is set forth in the record that when the Eeids showed them the house, they \u201cacted\u201d as though they were seeing it for the first time; however, since we do not know precisely what actions justify this conclusory statement, we shall attach no weight to it. In any event it appears that the Gills\u2019 own conduct in these transactions induced the owner to believe that no broker was involved in the deal.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\"> The parties\u2019 briefs agree upon one point, namely, that the Gills are not relieved of liability merely because plaintiff\u2019s authority was oral and its claim to commissions is therefore unenforceable as against the owner. <em>N. J. S. A. </em>25:1 \u2014 9. The authorities almost unanimously hold that the statute of frauds was enacted for the benefit of a party to the transaction and is not available to strangers who tortiously interfere with contractual or advantageous relations created by the transaction. <em>Louis Kamm, Inc., v.

As stated in <em>Prosser, Torts (2d ed.), </em>726, speaking of the tort we are now dealing with,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-4\">the law \u201cindulges in the assumption that even unenforceable promises will be carried out if no third person interferes. Accordingly, it usually is held that contracts which are voidable by reason of the statute of frauds, foz-mal defects, lack of consideration, lack of mutuality, or even uncertainty of terms, still afford a basis for a tort action when the defendant interferes with their performance.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">1 <em>Harper and James, Torts, </em>\u00a7 6.7 (1956) observes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-6\">\u201c* * * it would seem that the rule [imposing liability on the tortfeasor] is the sound view. The object and policy of the law of contracts in denying an action on a contract within the provisions of the statute of frauds, obviously has little application to an action for inducing a breach, and the defendant\u2019s conduct, if unjustifiable in a case of an enforceable contract, is quite as reprehensible when the contract is unenforceable.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b186-8\"> We turn next to one of the Gills\u2019 principal contentions. They claim that since the complaint charges them <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>with having interfered with a <em>\u201ccontractual </em>relationship\u201d between plaintiff and Eeid, they cannot be held in this action, because the plaintiff at the trial sought to establish that they interfered with a <em>prospective contractual </em>relationship between the persons stated. It is quite true, as the G-ills say, that the listing of the property with the plaintiff, under the circumstances presented here, amounted merely to an offer by the owner to pay the plaintiff a commission if the plaintiff produced a purchaser able and willing to buy. When the broker produces the purchaser, a unilateral contract arises. <em>Skene v. </em>Carayanis, 103 <em>Conn. </em>708, 131 <em>A. </em>497, 498 <em>(Sup. Ct. Err. </em>1926); <em>Mechem, Outline of Agency (4th ed. </em>1952), \u00a7 560; <em>cf. </em>2 Mechem, <em>Agency (2d ed.), </em>2039. There is however nothing to the Grills\u2019 contention as to a variance; they are merely playing with the words in the complaint. Besides the matter was fully tried on the theory that the complaint had alleged a prospective contractual relation. <em>B. B. </em>4:15-2; 7 :l-3.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">The four questions we deal with next, center about the issue of causation: did the Grills\u2019 conduct cause Eeid not to pay a commission to the plaintiff; or was any cause of action plaintiff had against Eeid barred by lapse of time or on some other basis, quite apart from the Statute of Erauds ? Plaintiff certainly makes out its case on these questions, if it establishes that, had it had authority in writing, it would have been entitled to recover from Eeid.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-7\">The first of these four questions is this: would the lapse of time between the last time (September or December 1954) the plaintiff showed the house to Gill and the time (March 1955) the contract of sale was executed have barred any cause of action plaintiff may have had against Eeid? The trial court held that it would, and that plaintiff\u2019s \u201crights had expired\u201d by reason of its own inactivity. On this basis and on the basis of its conclusion on the next question, the court denied plaintiff any recovery against the Gills. The testimony on plaintiff\u2019s behalf indicated that plaintiff showed the house to the Gills during the Christmas holidays in 1954. Gill denied this, \u201e and it is not entirely clear from the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>court\u2019s finding whether it disbelieved or inadvertently overlooked the plaintiff\u2019s testimony in this particular. In any event there was this lapse of' time amounting from two to six months.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-4\"> It has been indicated in the <em>Restatement, Agency, </em>\u00a7 448d, that where a broker brings together a customer and the owner, and there is no substantial break in the ensuing negotiations, the broker <em>ordinarily </em>is to be held the efficient cause of the business and therefore to have entitled himself to compensation. <em>Cf. First New Hampshire Corp. v. Van Syckle, </em>37 <em>N. J. Super. </em>469 <em>(App. Div. </em>1955); <em>Murray Apfelbaum, Inc., v. Bernstein, </em>104 <em>N. J. L. </em>664 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1928). Under the particular circumstances of this case however, though there was a lapse of two to six months as above stated, nevertheless the proofs establish that the broker\u2019s efforts, taken with the fact that the Gills had in the interim secured the necessary funds, probably constituted the procuring cause which served to bring together the owner and the buyer. Moreover, it appears that once they were brought together, there was no substantial break in the ensuing negotiations. In that situation in our opinion, the lapse of time should not be held to have barred any cause of action the broker may have had against Reid for commissions.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">Second, would the lapse of about one year between the original listing of the property and the time of the contract of sale have barred any cause of action plaintiff may have had against Reid ? The trial court held as to this,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-6\">\u201cthat the proofs did not disclose that the original listing of the property with the plaintiff still existed during any part of 1955, but on the contrary the defendant, Reid, undertook, by posting its for sale sign on the property [in early 1955], to sell the house itself, and plaintiff\u2019s rights had expired by lapse of time.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b188-7\">Where no time is specified, a broker\u2019s authority ordinarily expires after the lapse of a reasonable time. The question as to what constitutes a reasonable time raises under present circumstances an issue of fact. <em>Breen v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number><em>Levine, </em>32 <em>N. J. Super. 525, 527 (App. Div. </em>1954), a case dealing with a lapse of some 14 months. The <em>Restatement, Agency, </em>\u00a7 446c, referring to the point, gives us one clue here, namely, by observing that in the \u201cordinary real estate transaction\u201d a reasonable time <em>\u201cmay be </em>a considerable period.\u201d (Italics added) The underlying test, however, is simply this: is it reasonable, in view of all the circumstances, for the broker to believe that the owner still intends him to act? <em>Restatement, Agency, </em>\u00a7 105b. We conclude that under the circumstances presented, the plaintiff had reason to believe that Eeid still intended it to act as broker in Eebruary 1955; Eeid was doubtless still desirous of all the help it could get to dispose of the property. , Hence we find that plaintiff\u2019s authority had not expired at that time. That being so, we can disregard the testimony as to several telephone conversations between plaintiff and Eeid regarding the premises; we have neither the dates of these talks, nor information concerning what was said. It may however be noted, in passing, that the <em>Restatement, Agency, </em>\u00a7 105b (and see <em>Illusi. </em>4) has this to say on the subject, namely, that the broker\u2019s</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-4\">\u201cAuthority may be kept alive beyond what otherwise would be a reasonable time by the fact that the principal knows that the agent is continuing to make efforts to perform and acquiesces therein.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b189-5\"><em>Cf. Richard v. Spagna, 5 N. J. Misc. </em>33, 37 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1926), affirmed 103 <em>N. J. L. </em>711 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1927).</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">Third, would this lapse' of one year and the fact that Eeid did not, until the day of the closing, know of plaintiff\u2019s connection with the Gills, have barred any cause of action plaintiff may have had against Eeid? Generally a broker\u2019s right to a fee is not dependent upon the owner\u2019s knowledge that the purchaser was procured through the broker\u2019s activity. <em>McLaughlin v. Campbell, </em>78 <em>N. J. L. </em>541, 548 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1909); <em>Walsh v. Isgro, </em>121 <em>N. J. L. </em>165, 169 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1938); <em>Shafer v. Berg Embroidery Works, </em>109 <em>N. J. L. </em>546 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1932). As the <em>Restatement, Agency, </em>\u00a7 448d, says,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>\u201cnor is it necessary that the broker should personally introduce the customer * * *; he introduces the customer if, through any means which he uses to attract attention, the purchaser is led to the principal.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">But the problem with which we are immediately concerned extends a little further than this. It is dealt with in <em>Restatement, Agency, </em>\u00a7 448f, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-6\">\u201cOrdinarily, a broker who has been the effective cause of a transaction is entitled to the agreed commission although the principal does not know that the broker has played a part in the negotiations and although the principal, because of this ignorance, has made lower terms than he otherwise would have done * * *. Having promised the broker a commission, the principal ordinarily should know that the appearance of a customer may have been caused by the broker, and to avoid liability for payment he should make inquiries of the broker. On the other hand, the principal has no duty to pay him a commission if the broker has given the principal reason to believe that he has not caused the customer to appear, as where he has been inactive.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b190-8\">Compare Mechem\u2019s pointed observations on this subject. <em>2 Mechem, Agency (2d ed.), </em>\u00a7 2436. However while we may raise up such a rule in the owner\u2019s interests where the broker has been inactive over a period of time, we see no justification for invoking the rule in order to rescue the Gills. For they were entirely aware of the plaintiff\u2019s role in the transaction, and indeed for their own self-enrichment they purposely set about to deprive the plaintiff of the rewards of its activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-9\">Fourth, would any cause of action plaintiff may have had against Reid have been barred by reason of the fact that it had authority apparently to sell the property for $14,500, whereas the price paid by the Gills was $13,750 ($14,000, with an allowance of $250 for not decorating) ? It is entirely settled that a broker ordinarily earns his commissions when he procures for the owner a purchaser able and willing to meet either the price and the terms specified in the authority given him <em>or such other price and terms as are satisfactory to the owner. </em>Judge Jayne has collected the cases in this State dealing with the point. <em>Marschalk </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number><em>v. Weber, </em>11 <em>N. J. Super. </em>16, 21 <em>(App. Div. </em>1950). So here, the fact that the house may have been listed at $14,500, $750 more than the purchase price, would not have prevented plaintiff from recovering from Reid. Incidentally, it should not be overlooked that $14,500, less a 5% brokerage charge, comes to $13,775.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">It is to be observed next that only a single broker is involved in the sale to the Gills and that the problem differs somewhat where there is more than one broker. <em>Weinstein v. Clementsen, 20 N. J. Super. </em>367, 374 <em>(App. Div. </em>1952); <em>George F. Hewson Co. v. Hopper, </em>130 <em>N. J. L. </em>525 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1943). See further <em>Vreeland v. Vetterlein, </em>33 <em>N. J. L. </em>247, 249 <em>et seq. (Sup. Ct. </em>1869); <em>Restatement, Agency, </em>\u00a7 448e. The policy of the law, founded in the economics of free enterprise and individualism, which strives not to stifle legitimate competition \u2014 and which may relieve a broker of liability where through fair competitive means he makes a sale, interfering with another broker\u2019s business relations \u2014 does not however operate to relieve the Gills here. The Gills attempt to draw an analogy between the efforts of a competing broker and those made here by the owner to sell the property, namely, by putting up the sign in early 1955. But as we have already indicated, it was the plaintiff\u2019s endeavors, not the owner\u2019s sign, which probably were the procuring cause of the ensuing negotiations between Beid and the Gills.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">The damages here, as evidenced by the above-mentioned binder, consist in the loss of a brokerage fee of 5% on the purchase price of $13,750, namely, $687.50. We cannot say on the basis of the proofs before us that the parties would probably have gotten together on a price of $14,500; plaintiff has therefore not established its right to a commission equal to 5% of $14,500.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-7\">Bevorsed, with directions to enter judgment in plaintiff\u2019s favor against the defendants Thomas E. Gill and Eileen A. Gill in the sum of $687.50.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
