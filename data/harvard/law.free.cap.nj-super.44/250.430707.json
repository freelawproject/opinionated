A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"AnEj\">On May 31, 1956 the grand jury of the County of Bergen presented to the court an indictment charging the defendant Erank Kobylarz and one Raymond Bednarski with a conspiracy to make and take in the Borough of Wood-Ridge what is commonly known as a book upon the running of horses, mares and geldings, which un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>lawful project was alleged to have been pursued from June 1, 1955 until on or about August 25, 1955. Not unprecedentedly in such prosecutions the defendant Bednarski retracted his plea of not guilty to the accusations of the indictment, entered a plea of guilty -thereto, and testified on behalf of the State in its prosecution of the defendant Kobylarz, who was upon trial by jury convicted of the alleged offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\"> Initially we may announce in response to the defendant\u2019s first ground of appeal that we have thoughtfully examined the evidence introduced by the State and also that submitted on behalf of the defendant and conclude that there was relevant and competent evidence when the State rested and at the completion of the testimony from which a logical inference of the defendant\u2019s guilt of the alleged offense could be deduced by the jury. <em>State v. Picciotti, </em>12 <em>N. J. </em>205 (1953); <em>State v. Huff, </em>14 <em>N. J. </em>240, 249 (1954); <em>State v. Rogers, </em>19 <em>N. J. </em>218, 231, 232 (1955); <em>State v. Kollarik, 22 N. J. </em>558, 564 (1956), are expressive of the test. Moreover, a conspiracy may be proved by circumstances from which the jury can logically infer its existence. <em>State v. Carbone, </em>10 <em>N. J. </em>329, 341 (1952). The motions of the defendant for judgments of acquittal were properly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">Another reason assigned for the reversal of the conviction pertains to the cross-examination of the defendant concerning his previous conviction of crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-7\">On direct examination counsel for the defendant deemed it to be perspicacious in the course of his interrogation unobtrusively to propound the following question to the defendant: \u201cSome years ago you were convicted of a crime, weren\u2019t you?\u201d The answer was \u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b273-8\">The following quotation extracted from the transcript exhibits the subsequent cross-examination of the defendant anent the subject:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-9\">\u201cQ. What was the crime you were convicted o\u00a3?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-10\">The Court: Just a minute.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-11\">Mr. Selser: I object to that question, if your Honor please.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>Mr. G-alcla: May I be heard on the question?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-4\">Under direct examination, Mr. Selser asked whether he was convicted of crime years ago.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-5\">The Witness: That\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-6\">Q. What was the crime?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-7\">Mr. Selser: I object to it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-8\">The Court: I will allow it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-9\">The Witness: What was the crime?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-10\">Q. Speak loudly and clearly so we can all hear it. A. The crime \u2014I really don\u2019t remember offhand, to be honest with you. I don\u2019t know much about \u2014 I know I pleaded to a crime. I pleaded non vult to a crime.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-11\">Q. What was the crime? A. I think it was bookmaking. I am not sure.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-12\">Q. Bookmaking. Were you convicted for another crime? A. I was convicted of another one?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-13\">Q. Were you, sir? A. Probably if you have it there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-14\">Q. What was that crime? A. That crime, I don\u2019t know. That was twenty-five or more years ago, I believe.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-15\">Q. In 1951 were you convicted of a crime? A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-16\">Q. What was that crime? A. That\u2019s what I said \u2014 it was bookmaking.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-17\">Q. Prior to that? A. Then I was convicted of another crime but I said it was about twenty-five years ago.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-18\">Q. What was that crime? A. I don\u2019t remember it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b274-19\">The permitted disclosure thus elicited from the defendant that his previous conviction had been for the crime of bookmaking is characterized by his counsel as-erroneous and declared to have been materially prejudicial to the defendant. The basis of the insistence is that the disclosure was intended by the prosecution to reveal the propensity of the defendant to commit the crime of bookmaking rather than to affect the credibility of the defendant\u2019s testimony. <em>N. J. S. </em>34:81-13.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-20\">A very illuminating and informational discussion of the distinction between the available use of proof of prior convictions resides in the opinion composed by former Judge Horuvitz in <em>State v. Nagy, </em>37 <em>N. J. Super. </em>1 <em>(App. Div. </em>1953).</p>\n<p id=\"b274-21\">In the present case the defendant voluntarily resolved to testify in his own behalf and chose to impart the existence of his prior conviction. He thus subjected himself to cross-examination. \"Where a defendant either on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>direct or cross-examination acknowledges a prior conviction of crime, it is not erroneous for the trial court to permit the State by ensuing interrogation to expose such factual components of the judgment of conviction as the production of the record thereof would reveal. <em>State v. Merra, </em>103 <em>N. J. L. </em>361 (E. <em>&amp; A. </em>1921); <em>State v. Rusnak, </em>108 <em>N. J. L. </em>84 (E. <em>&amp; A. </em>1931); <em>State v. Metalski, </em>116 <em>N. J. L. </em>543 (E <em>&amp; A. </em>1936); <em>State v. Taylor, </em>5 N. <em>J. </em>474, 479 (1950); <em>State v. Nagy, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">The purpose for which the prior conviction of the defendant was divulged in the present case is indicated by the related passage of the court\u2019s instruction to the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-6\">\u201cUpon the subject of credibility of any witness or the defendant as such witness, it is now the law that no person offered as a witness shall be excluded by reason of his having been convicted of a crime, but such conviction of crime may be shown for the purpose of affecting his or her credit as such a witness. Pursuant thereto, the state has shown that the defendant has been convicted of crime. You may, therefore, take that into consideration in determining whether or not you will believe the defendant or what weight or credit you shall in your judgment accord to the testimony of that witness.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b275-7\">The remaining feature of the trial which counsel for the defendant criticizes is more engrossing. Here again the episode can be recounted with superior distinctness by the reproduction of the pertinent testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-8\">The following extract comes from the testimony of Detective Spahr:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-9\">\u201cQ. Now, Detective, subsequently, did you have occasion subsequent to the examination in Palka\u2019s Tavern, did you have occasion to speak with the defendant Kobylarz? A. I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-10\">Q. When and where? A. That afternoon in the Bergen County Prosecutor\u2019s Office.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-11\">Q. What, if anything, did the defendant Kobylarz say to you at that time? A. He gave me his name and address.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-12\">Q. AYas he confronted with Mr. Bednarski at that time? A. He was.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-13\">Q. And at that time in the presence of Mr. Kobylarz, did Bednarski state this particular operation \u2014 the facts concerning the same as testified to here earlier?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-14\">Mr. Selser: I object to it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>The Court: I will allow it. A. He did, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-4\">Q. Did Mr. Kobylarz either admit or deny at that time\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-5\">Mr. Selser: If the Court please, I object.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-6\">The Court: Objection sustained.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-7\">What did Mr. Kobylarz say?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-8\">The Witness: Mr. Kobylarz refused to give any answer whatsoever, sir.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b276-9\">The defendant during his cross-examination imparted the rather equivocal explanation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-10\">\u201cQ. Do you remember when you were brought to the Prosecutor\u2019s Office? A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-11\">Q. When Mr. Bednarski was also in your presence and being interrogated? A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-12\">Q. And do you recall being asked at that time concerning this alleged operation? A. No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-13\">Q. You don\u2019t recall being asked? A. No, sir. They didn\u2019t ask me nothing. The only one they asked was Bednarski.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-14\">Q. They didn\u2019t ask you anything? A. They wanted a statement off me, yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-15\">Q. Didn\u2019t they ask whether or not you entered into an agreement with Bednarski? A. No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-16\">Q. Do you recall Mr. Spahr \u2014 will you stand up? (Detective Spahr stands in the audience.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-18\">Q. Did this gentleman, known as Detective Spahr, ask you questions concerning this? A. Someone did, sir, but I don\u2019t remember who they were \u2014 there were so many in there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-19\">Q. They did ask you questions, didn\u2019t they? A. All they asked me was my name and address and that was all I said.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-20\">Q. Is that all they asked you? A. I don\u2019t remember what they asked me, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-21\">Q. They asked you other questions though, didn\u2019t they? A. They probably did but I don\u2019t remember them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-22\">Q. During that time, did you state to Detective Spahr that you refused to answer any questions? A. That is what they always tell you\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-23\">Q. Did you know what they always do, did you at that time? A. Did I state to them I refuse to answer any questions?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-24\">Q. That\u2019s right. A. I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t remember. I probably did. I am not sure.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b276-25\">Whenever during the past century the members of the bench and bar have been concerned in this jurisdiction with the rule of evidence appertaining to tacit admissions in criminal cases, sometimes characterized as the doctrine of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>assenting silence, they have habitually consulted the decision in <em>Donnelly v. State, </em>36 <em>N. J. L. </em>601 <em>(E. </em>&amp; <em>A. </em>1857), wherein the rule is announced:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-5\">\u201cWhen a matter is stated in the hearing of one, which injuriously affects his rights, and he understands it, and assents to it, wholly or in part, by a reply, both are admissible in evidence; the answer, because it is the act of the party, who is presumed to have acted under the force of truth, and the statement as giving point and meaning to the action. So, also, silence, unless it be accounted for by some of the circumstances which have been specified, or by other sufficient reasons, may be taken as a tacit admission of the fact stated; because a person knowing the truth or falsity of a statement affecting his rights, made by another in his presence, tinder circumstances calling for a reply, will naturally deny it, if he be at liberty so to do, if he does not intend to admit it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">Some of the many successive illustrations of its application appear in <em>Parker v. State, </em>61 <em>N. J. L. </em>308, 313 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1898), affirmed 63 <em>N. J. L. </em>801 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1899); <em>State v. Rosa, </em>72 <em>N. J. L. </em>462 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1905); <em>State v. Johnson, </em>73 <em>N. J. L. </em>199, 202 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1906); <em>State v. MacFarland, </em>83 <em>N. J. L. </em>474 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1912); <em>State v. Kysilka, </em>84 <em>N. J. L. </em>6 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1913), affirmed 85 <em>N. J. L. </em>712 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1914); <em>State v. D\u2019Adame, </em>84 <em>N. J. L. </em>386 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1913); <em>State v. Morris, </em>94 <em>N. J. L. </em>19 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1919), affirmed 94 <em>N. J. L. </em>567 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1920); <em>State v. Claymonst, </em>96 <em>N. J. L. </em>1 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1921); <em>State v. De Paola, </em>5 <em>N. J. </em>1, 15 (1950); <em>State v. Picciotti, </em>13 <em>N. J. </em>205, 209 (1953); <em>State v. Panderos, </em>20 <em>N. J. </em>76, 84 (1955); <em>State v. Kane, </em>9 <em>N. J. Super. </em>254 <em>(App. Div. </em>1950); <em>State v. Bulach, </em>10 <em>N. J. Super. </em>107, 114 <em>(App. Div. </em>1950); <em>State v. Bobbins, </em>35 <em>N. J. Super. </em>494, 502 <em>(App. Div. </em>1955), affirmed 21 <em>N. J. </em>338 (1956). See, additionally, 80 <em>A. L. R. </em>1235; 115 <em>A. L. R. </em>1510.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-9\">Basically, the rationale of this rule of evidence is probably inherent in the proverbial expression that \u201csilence gives consent.\u201d There are many familiar proverbs and maxims of an oppugnant meaning: \u201cClosed lips hurt no one, speaking may\u201d \u2014 Cato; \u201cSilence, like a poultice, comes to heal the blows of sound\u201d \u2014 Holmes; \u201cSilence never betrays you\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>\u2014O\u2019Beilly; \u201cSilence is the most perfect expression of scorn\u201d \u2014Shaw; \u201cIt is the wise head that makes the still tongue\u201d\u2014 Lucas; \u201cSilence never shows itself to so great an advantage as when it is made in reply to calumny and defamation\u201d \u2014Addison.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\">It is said nevertheless that the crystallization of human experience has disclosed it to be the natural reaction of one accused of crime spontaneously to deny the accusation if it is unfounded. This was declared to be an unreliable basis for a rule of evidence by Chief Justice Maxey in his noted dissenting opinion in <em>Commonwealth v. </em>Vallone, 347 <em>Pa. </em>419, 32 <em>A. 2d </em>889 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1943). It is a very interesting composition and should be read.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">Some psychologists regard silence <em>per se </em>to be a neutral factor and aside from a consideration of the surrounding circumstances as indicating neither guilt nor innocence, and thus the determination whether the statement is patently incriminatory and was made in the hearing of the accused at such a time and place and in such a manner and environment as naturally to invite a response, becomes an essential determinative of the probative value, if any, of the inference to be drawn from his silence. Vide, for examples, <em>Commonwealth v. </em>Coyne, 115 <em>Pa. Super. </em>23, 175 <em>A. </em>291 <em>(Super. Ct. </em>1934); <em>Riley v. State, </em>107 <em>Miss. </em>600, 65 <em>So. </em>882, <em>L. R. A. </em>1915A, 1041 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1914).</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">There are at least two divergently expressed conceptions of the purpose of such evidence: the one, to prove a tacit admission by the accused of the truth of the incriminatory statement; the other, to show a deviation from type, an abnormality in the silence of the accused which displays his consciousness of guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-7\">Professor Wigmore has expressed favor toward the admission in evidence of corresponding statements and facts tending to disclose a consciousness of innocence. Wigmore, <em>Evidence (3d ed.), </em>\u00a7 293. But see <em>Underhill's Criminal Evidence (5th ed.), </em>\u00a7 382.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-8\">It must be acknowledged that the versatile conventionalities of human emotions and impulses constitute an erratic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>and unstable pedestal upon which to perpetuate a rule of law. We observe today that so many accused persons deliberately recognize safety in silence and are more interested in protection from eventual prosecution and conviction than in preliminary protestations of innocence.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">That this rule of evidence has been rejected by many courts of the highest credit is evident upon a review of the authorities. It is the view of this court that where an accused is in the custody of the police at a relatively formal meeting deliberately arranged and attended by officers hostile to him and there faced with the incriminatory accusations, the circumstances amid which he remains silent should be shown to be such that no explanation of his silence is reasonable other than his acquiescence in the truth of the accusations. Even so, the court without specific request should inform the jury of the several elements of the rule governing the admissibility and weight of such evidence. Indeed, some courts have evaluated evidence of silence in such situations as not sufficient to support a conviction in the absence of other evidence from which guilt may be logically inferred. <em>Commonwealth v. </em>Karmendi, 325 <em>Pa. </em>63, 188 <em>A. 752 (Sup. Ct. </em>1937); 53 <em>Dickinson Law Rev. </em>518.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">To constitute proof of an admission by silence, it must be disclosed by evidence (1) that the statement was extra-judicial; (2) that it was incriminatory or accusative in import; (3) that it was one to which an innocent man would in the situation and surrounding circumstances naturally respond; (4) that it was uttered in the presence and the hearing of the accused; (5) that he was capable of understanding the incriminatory meaning of the statement; and (6) that he was at liberty to deny or reply thereto. 2 <em>Whartons Criminal </em>Evidence, \u00a7 409. Prosecuting attorneys should therefore behold the elements of proof necessary to erect the basic premise for the application of the rule. Without the precursory proof of those indispensable elements of fact, the reception in evidence of the statement and of the evidence of the silence of the accused is futile and erroneous.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>\u201cWhere admissions are implied from silence, the trier of the facts should be doubly cautious, for in addition to the reasons that apply to oral confessions, there may be doubt whether the defendant heard and understood the statement which his silence is supposed to admit as true, and doubt whether he did not consider that he ought to remain silept until he were directly questioned.\u201d <em>State v. Toohey, </em>6 <em>N. J. Super. </em>97, 101 <em>(App. Div. </em>1950).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b280-4\">Of the requisite factual elements of preliminary proof none is of more significant importance than a reasonably literal recitation of the language, phraseology, diction and mode of expression of the accusative statement. Only from such information can the imputative character and accusatory import of the declaration be determined.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">Noticeably in the present case, the representative of the State did not endeavor to elicit from the witness Detective Spahr a reasonably specific and definite representation and reproduction of the actual utterances of the co-conspirator Bednarski in the hearing of the defendant on the designated occasion.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">Probably to accelerate the progress of the trial, the manifestly leading question was addressed to the witness which squeezed out of him the affirmative answer that in the judgment of the witness, Bednarski did state in the presence of the defendant \u201cthis particular operation \u2014 the facts concerning the same as testified to here earlier.\u201d While possible, it seems inconceivable that except in comparative substance the declarations of Bednarski at the prosecutor\u2019s office were as capacious as his testimony at the trial. However, for reasons too obvious to need exposition, we express our disapproval of that method of endeavoring to prove the previous extra-judicial statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-7\">But, should we upon our deliberate consideration of the entire record ascribe to that irregularity such a harmful and prejudicial consequence in the trial of the defendant as to require in the interests of fundamental fairness a reversal of the judgment of conviction?</p>\n<p id=\"b280-8\">It is noticeable that in the present case the trial judge discussed the so-called assenting silence rule in his instructions to the jury. We quote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>\u201c\u00ae * * If a defendant remains silent in the face of an oral accusation of guilt or declaration injuriously affecting his position of guilt or innocence under circumstances calling for a denial on his part, it may be taken against him. Silence, unless it is accounted for by some sufficient reason, may be taken as a tacit admission of the fact stated \u2014 all the circumstances of the crime and occasion should be considered by the jury when estimating the value of the implied admission and in determining whether any is to be inferred. Whether the circumstances call for a reply and what significance to be attached to whatever occurred, is for the jury alone to determine. The fact the defendant was in the custody of the police at the time he remained silent does not preclude proof of the facts but his custody is a circumstance to be taken into consideration.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-5\">Silence alone is a very slight evidence of guilt and aside from the interference which may arise from the attendant circumstances, shall be received with caution as proof of guilt, and if from the attendant circumstances he shall show' to the satisfaction of the jury that his silence was caused by reasons or prompted by motives consistent with his innocence, the accusatory statements and his silence should be disregarded and among the many reasons which he may show for silence would be that a few minutes before he had denied a similar accusation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">Comparo, <em>State v. Landeros, supra, </em>20 <em>N. J., </em>at <em>page </em>85.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">Thus tlie jurors wore informed that \"silence alone is a very slight evidence of guilt\u201d and \"shall be received with caution as proof of guilt,\u201d and that \u201cwhether the circumstances call for a reply and what significance to be attached to whatever occurred is for the jury alone to determine.\u201d The explanations given by the defendant at the trial concerning what had been said in his presence and hearing at the prosecutor\u2019s office were conspicuously evasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-8\">While in general there exists a recognizable conflict of judicial opinion on the subject, it is settled in our jurisdiction that evidence of the defendant\u2019s silence is not necessarily to be excluded merely because at the time that he was confronted with the accusative statement, he was, as perhaps in this instance, in the custody of police officers. <em>State v. Landeros, supra. </em>See, <em>contra, People v. Pignataro, </em>263 <em>N. Y. </em>229, 188 <em>N. E. </em>720 <em>(Ct. App. </em>1934); 20 <em>Wash. L.
