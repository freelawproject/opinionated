J. A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"A2a\">The petitioner in this workmen\u2019s compensation case was denied relief in the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Division. The County Court reversed, holding that he had sustained a permanent disability, namely, an 80% binaural loss of hearing, resulting from exposure to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>noise produced by washing machines in the employer\u2019s plant. The employer appeals. It is conceded by the employer that loss of hearing, resulting from noise in the employment, is an occupational disease within the purview of the amend.ments to <em>N. J. S. A. </em>34:15-30 and 34:15-31, effective January 1, 1950. See <em>Larson, Workmen\u2019s Compensation (Cum. Supp. </em>1956), \u00a7 41.40, <em>n. </em>26.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\">On the first argument of this case we passed upon certain factual questions raised by the employer. There remains to be considered whether the award can be sustained under the amendments cited, notwithstanding proofs, including an audiogram taken in 1945, which indicate that petitioner had definitely suffered a substantial impairment of hearing by that time, some five years before the amendments took effect. In fact, the employer contends that petitioner then had at least a 40% to 50% loss of hearing. In dealing with this question petitioner rests his case entirely on the theory that his hearing became progressively worse from sometime prior to 1945 until 1953 and that the right to compensation under the occupational disease statutes does not accrue until the disability reaches its \u201cpeak\u201d and becomes \u201cstatic.\u201d Eeliance is placed on the quoted words which appear in <em>Calabria v. Liberty Mutual Insurance Co., </em>4 <em>N. J. </em>64, at <em>papes </em>69, 70, 71 (1950). However, Mr. Justice Case who wrote the opinion for the court in that case, did not embody these concepts in the standard which he laid down there, namely, that a partial permanent disability occurs when \u201ca definite fault akin to a traumatic injury occurs\u201d- \u2014 -that is, when a definite impairment of bodily function or of a part of the body occurs. Eurther see <em>Biglioli v. Durotest Corp., </em>44 <em>N. J. Super. </em>93 <em>(App. Div. </em>1957), filed herewith.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">Petitioner\u2019s theory is indicated by the response his counsel gave to a question put on the oral argument. We asked counsel to suppose a case where a defect in hearing, attributable to an employment, originated after January 1, 1950, and in 1952 increased to a definite permanent disability amounting to a 50% loss of hearing and then progressively <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>over a course ol eight years after 1952, increased still further until it reached a peak of 80%, becoming static at that point. Petitioner\u2019s counsel answered, contending that no right to compensation with respect to any part of the permanent disability of 80% arose until 1960. We cannot believe that under the statute the employee is required to withhold his claim for the permanent disability until 1960.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-4\">The proofs in the instant case demonstrate that a definite \u201cfault\u201d or loss of hearing may have occurred in 1945. Are the occupational disease amendments applicable to this loss of hearing? <em>Mnich v. American Radiator Co., </em>263 <em>App. Div. </em>573, 34 <em>N. Y. S. 2d </em>16 <em>(App. Div. </em>1942), affirmed 289 <em>N. Y. </em>681, 682, 45 <em>N. E. 2d </em>333 <em>(Ct. App. </em>1942),, is of some interest here, though we do not pass on the point there decided. The case held that a common-law cause of action for \u201cinjuries suffered\u201d from silicosis <em>up to </em>the effective date of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation amendment (which first rendered silicosis claims compensable under the New York Compensation Law), was a vested right, which the Legislature did not intend to take away from the plaintiff when it adopted the amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">Petitioner relies upon <em>Koval v. Natural Products Refining Co., </em>25 <em>N. J. Misc. </em>489 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1947), in which Mr. Justice Case held that a disability consisting of a nasal perforation due to chrome poisoning did not arise until January 8, 1946. The question there presented was whether the disability should be calculated upon the 1945 schedule of compensation or upon the 1946 schedule which was more favorable to the petitioner. In December 1945, while receiving treatment for a back injury, petitioner called the doctor\u2019s attention to an <em>itch in his nose, </em>and the doctor then informed him that \u201cthere was a hole in it.\u201d But it was not until January 8, 1946 that the employee quit working, because he could \u201cnot stand it any more.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">It is to be observed in connection with that decision, first, that Mr. Justice Case, when thereafter he came to write the opinion in <em>Calabria,, </em>laid down as a part of the test that the \u201cfault\u201d must be \u201cdefinite.\u201d In <em>Koval, </em>as we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>\u25a0understand it, there was no proof of a definite disability until January 8, 1946.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-4\"> It is also to be observed in connection with <em>Koval </em>that, in accordance with the settled policy of the law, we construe and apply the Workmen\u2019s Compensation statute liberally, resolving doubts in the employee\u2019s favor. <em>Gargiulo v. Gargiulo, </em>13 <em>N. J. </em>8, 13 (1953). In accordance with this principle, the courts and the Division in a matter of doubt will tend to hold that a bodily impairment did not become definite until after January 1, 1950. So in <em>Estelle v. Board of Ed. of Borough of Red Bank, </em>26 <em>N. J. Super. </em>9, 23, 24 <em>(App. Div. </em>1953), modified 14 <em>N. J. </em>256 (1954), the Appellate Division said, speaking of the employee\u2019s bodily impairment resulting from an occupational disease</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-5\">\u201c* \u00ae * he was not much inconvenienced until after the statute went into effect.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-7\">* * * In the case at bar, there was no incapacity for work and no \u2018definite fault\u2019 prior to January 1, 1950, when the amendment of 1949 became effective.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b138-9\">And the Supreme Court said, 14 <em>N. J., </em>at <em>page </em>259:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-10\">\u201c\u00ae * * the plaintiff <em>became </em>incapacitated\u201d after January 1, 1950 when the amendment took effect (italics added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b138-11\">In <em>Giambattista v. Thomas A. Edison, Inc., </em>32 <em>N. J. Super. </em>103, 111 <em>(App. Div. </em>1954), it could be said, too, that the \u201cfault\u201d did not become \u201cdefinite\u201d until after January 1, 1950, for the court seems to hold that not until then was</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-12\">\u201chis disability * * * sufficiently severe to bring about the filing of a formal claim. <em>Cf. Estelle v. Board of Education of Borough of Red Bank, </em>14 <em>N. J. </em>256, 258 (1954).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b138-14\"><em>Cf. </em>Larson\u2019s interpretation of <em>Calabria. Larson, supra, </em>\u00a7 95.23. Further see <em>Biglioli v. Durotest Corp., </em>44 <em>N. J. Super. </em>93 <em>(App. Div. </em>1957).</p>\n<p id=\"b138-15\"><em>Russo v. Despatch Shops, Inc., </em>280 <em>App. Div. </em>1008, 1030, 116 <em>N. Y. S. 2d </em>788 <em>(App. Div. </em>1952), cited by the peti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>tioner, was a ease of occupational deafness where the exposure to the noise seems to have ceased while one insurance carrier was on the risk, but the definite disablement seems not to have occurred until later when another carrier took over the risk. It was held that the latter carrier was liable.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">When we put the present case down for reargument we left open the question whether an employer should be held under the occupational disease amendments for a disability of an employee occurring before January 1, 1950, where the employee did not know of its relation to his employment until thereafter. Further, see <em>Biglioli v. Durotest Corp., supra. </em>That theory has not, except in an incidental way, been urged by petitioner on the reargument, and we therefore should not pass on it. There is testimony by the petitioner and his sister that he was not aware of the connection between the deafness and the din of the employer\u2019s machines; but it hardly seems likely that he was unaware of this connection, and in fact the testimony was brought out by the employer through leading questions, undoubtedly in order to discredit him.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">Petitioner here suffered a definite impairment in his hearing prior to January 1, 1950. We are satisfied that he is not entitled to recover therefor, but that he may recover for any definite increase in this disability occurring on or after that date, which is due, not to the natural progress of the preexisting impairment, but to the continued exposure to the noise. <em>Larson, supra, </em>\u00a7 95.23 and 95.26; <em>Calabria v. Liberty Mutual Insurance Co., </em>4 <em>N. J. </em>64, 70 (1950). Proof as to such an increase can be secured from expert witnesses and other sources.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-7\">The proofs on this subject are not in such shape as to warrant a finding by us on the point, and the case will therefore have to be reversed, with directions for a new hearing before the Division to ascertain the amount of such an increase, if any. The Division will of course be bound by the finding of the County Court that petitioner at the time of the prior hearing was suffering from an 80% binaural deafness.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>An application may be made to the County Court for counsel fees for unusual services in this court (in connection with both the argument and reargument of the case), and also for such modification of the attorneys\u2019 allowances heretofore made for services in the. Division and County Court, as that court deems advisable. <em>R. R. </em>5:2-5 <em>(f). </em>It should be borne in mind that neither the employee, nor the employer, has been entirely successful in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-4\">We should also take note of the excessive allowances heretofore made by the County Court to petitioner\u2019s attorney, namely, $1,000 for his services in the Division and $1,000 for his services in that court. The award was $4,800 for the disability, $125 for medical expenses and $304 by way of reimbursement for the costs of a stenographic transcript. Without stopping to determine whether the $304 forms part of the \u201cjudgment\u201d on which the attorney\u2019s <em>maximum </em>fee of 20% for services in the Division can be computed <em>(N. J. S. A. </em>34:15-63; <em>Bobertz v. Township of </em>Hillside, 126 <em>N. J. L. </em>416 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1941)), we think these allowances should not have been granted. In any event they will, of course, have to be reduced in view of our determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">Po costs on appeal.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
