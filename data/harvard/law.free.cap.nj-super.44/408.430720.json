J. A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"AFv\">Plaintiff, administrator <em>c. t. a </em>of the estate of Theodore J. Badgley, instituted this action for a judicial construction of his will and for instructions. Those brought in as defendants were the four nephews and nieces of decedent\u2019s wife Emma (hereinafter designated \u201cappellants\u201d), who were to take the residuary estate in a certain contingency, and decedent\u2019s niece, who was Badgley\u2019s only heir at law and next of kin (hereinafter designated \u201crespondent\u201d). The Chancery Division concluded that the contingency had not come to pass, decedent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>died intestate, and respondent was entitled to the residuary. The wife\u2019s kin appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-4\">\u25a0 Decedent was a member of the New Jersey Bar. On January 7, 1941 he and his wife executed similar wills, each giving his (her) entire estate to the other and nominating the other executrix (executor). Both wills then provided as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-5\">\u201cThis Will is made expressly subject to this contingency: in ease I and my said wife shall die or meet death as the result of a common disaster, I give, devise and bequeath all my estate, both real and personal, of whatsoever kind and nature, as follows: I give, devise and bequeath the net income accruing from one half share or portion of my estate to my brother OLIVER K. BADGLEY for and during the term of his natural life, and upon the death of said Oliver K. Badgley, I give, devise and bequeath said one half share or portion of my estate to the nephews and nieces of my wife, Emma E. Badgley, that is to say: to ELVA M. LUPHER, DOROTHY JONES, JOHN W. DUTTON and CHESTER S. DUTTON, to be equally divided among them share and share alike, their heirs and assigns forever; and I give, devise and bequeath the remaining one half portion of my estate to the nephews and nieces of my wife Emma E. Badgley, viz: ELVA M. LUPHER, DOROTHY JONES, JOHN W. DUTTON and CHESTER S. DUTTON, to be equally divided among them share and share alike, to them, their heirs and assigns forever.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-8\">In case of the happening of the above contingency, whereby my death and the death of my wife shall occur as a common disaster, I nominate, constitute and appoint the MONTCLAIR TRUST COMPANY, of MONTCLAIR, NEW JERSEY, Executor of this my Last Will and Testament, with full power and authority to grant, bargain, sell and convey and lease and mortgage any or all of my real estate or any interest therein, and to execute and deliver good and sufficient instruments for that purpose, and I direct that no bond or security shall be required of said Montclair Trust Company, Montclair, New Jersey, as Executor of this my Last Will and Testament, in case it shall act as Executor of this my Last Will and Testament on the happening of the above contingency.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b430-9\">Badgley\u2019s brother Oliver died a number of years prior to decedent, so that the life estate appointed for him never came into being and is not here involved. Oliver had been divorced by his wife in 1918; respondent is his only child.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-10\">The Badgley\u2019s never had any children. Decedent died January 10, 1956. ELis wife had predeceased him by a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>little more than a month, from causes admittedly in no way connected with that which brought on his death. Accordingly, the \u201ccommon disaster\u201d clause of the mutual wills never came into play.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\"> Appellants first project two fundamentals of will construction with which there can be no disagreement: (1) the ultimate aim of all construction is to determine the true intention of the testator, and this is to be drawn, not from any single clause of the will, but from a consideration of all the language found within its four corners. Besort may be had to extrinsic evidence touching the circumstances surrounding or attending the will, so as to place the court in the situation of the testator at the time of its execution. (2) The law abhors intestacy and presumes against it. Erom this background appellants go on to argue that tiie will contains adequate language upon which to predicate and sustain the gifts to them; and, alternatively and additionally, that \u201cfrom the whole of the will and the attendant circumstances a plain intention appears, and must be given effect, that the named beneficiary shall take in the event, as actually happened, that the wife predeceased the testator.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">Appellants insist that two distinct ideas are evident in the language of the contingency clause, \u201cin case I and my said wife shall die or meet death as the result of a common disaster.\u201d \u201cDie\u201d and \u201cmeet death,\u201d they say, are not congruent expressions. The first imports disease or debility, and the second some external and dramatic cause, instantly or ultimately fatal, ikppellants reason that the expression \u201cshall die\u201d is an independent thought, and that the words \u201cmeet death\u201d are modified by the phrase \u201cas the result of a common disaster\u201d to which they stand in juxtaposition. Appellants make their position entirely clear when they suggest the interpolation of a comma and three words in the contingency clause, so that it would read: \u201cin case I and my wife shall die[,] or [in case we] meet death as the result of a common disaster.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b432-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>There is little reason for drawing the suggested distinction which appellants urge upon us. Whatever differences might exist between \u201cdie\u201d and \u201cmeet death\u201d in another context, we agree with the trial judge that in this case they both denote one idea and one event. That this is so is made clear by several considerations. In the first place, the contingency clause is introduced by the words \u201cThis Will is made expressly subject to <em>this contingency\u201d </em>\u2014 the noun is singular. If any force whatever remains in appellants\u2019 contention that \u201cthis contingency\u201d is not necessarily to be limited to a single contemplated contingency, the testator made his intention clear beyond peradventure when, in the beginning of the very next paragraph, he said that \u201cIn case of the happening of <em>the above </em>contingency, whereby my death and the death of my wife shall occur as a common disaster,\u201d Montclair Trust Company was to act as executor. And at the close of that paragraph the language again is \u201con the happening of <em>the above contingency.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b432-4\">It only remains to be determined whether the will as written actually fails to provide for the contingency of testator\u2019s surviving his wife, or whether such provision can be found by implication. The case of <em>Glover v. </em>Reynolds, 135 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>113 <em>(Ch. </em>1944), affirmed o. b. 136 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>116 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1945), is dispositive. The husband and wife in that case had made mutual wills, each leaving the entire estate to the other. The wife\u2019s will provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-5\">\u201cIn the event that my husband and myself die simultaneously regardless of the order of passing, I give and bequeath my property both real and personal, wherever situated, as follows: * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">The husband predeceased his wife. The same arguments were advanced in <em>Glover </em>as here. In holding that the wife died intestate, the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-7\">\u201cIt is argued in the briefs that the intention of the decedent \u2018can be spelt out, and it logically appears to be: \u201cIn the event that my husband die,\u201d or in other words \u201cif my husband does not survive me, I give and bequeath,\u201d \u2019 etc. This argument is based on the premise that the testatrix did not intend to die intestate. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>The rule of presumption agqinst intestacy, however, cannot be used to justify a revision of the clear language of the will. <em>Federal Trust Co. v. Ost, </em>120 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>43; affirmed 121 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>608.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-4\">By her will, the testatrix appears to have had in mind only two possible situations; to wit, that she would predecease her husband or that they would die simultaneously, or, at least contemporaneously. She completely overlooked the contingency which did occur. Her failure to anticipate this, or, in the alternative, to execute a new will in the four months which intervened between the death of her husband and her death, cannot now be cured. This court, under the guise of construing the will, will not write a new one. As has frequently been pointed out in our decisions, it may be that if she could now express her views she would wish her estate to pass to the defendant beneficiaries, but this is of no moment here. * * <em>*\u201d </em>135 <em>N. J. Eq., </em>at <em>page </em>115.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">Appellants rely heavily upon <em>Russell v. Russell, </em>16 <em>N. J. Super. </em>589 <em>(App. Div. </em>1951), and seek to distinguish it from the <em>Glover </em>case. The court in <em>Bussell </em>recognized the <em>Glover </em>decision as authoritative. It noted that although there was a similarity between the two cases in the contingency provided for, \u201cthe similarity ends there.\u201d In <em>Bussell, </em>as here, there were mutual wills, each spouse naming the other as sole beneficiary and executor. The wills provided that in the event both should die, \u201cat or about the same time,\u201d the property should pass in equal shares to their son James and daughter Alice, \u201cbeing small recompense for their kindness and devotion to us,\u201d and that their third child, William, \u201cwho has been a very ungrateful and undutiful son, * * * shall not receive any part or share of my estate.\u201d Neither spouse, however, expressly provided for the contingency of being predeceased by the other. Mrs. Bussell died before her husband; upon the latter\u2019s death William claimed that his father had died intestate, so that J ames, Alice and he were entitled to equal one-third .shares of the estate. The court held that it could not read the will and its provisions sharply differentiating between James and Alice on the one hand and William on the other, and escape reaching the conviction that it was Mr. Bussell\u2019s positive intent that, as well in the contingency of his wife\u2019s predeceasing him as in the event that he and she died at or about the same time, his estate should pass only to James <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>and Alice, and William have none of it. In short, the court gave effect to what it considered the obvious testamentary intent and, by implication, supplied the words \u201cox my said wife should predecease me\u201d as part of the contingency clause. To like effect, see <em>Balcom v. </em>Balcom, 333 <em>Mass. </em>599, 132 <em>N. E. 2d </em>305 <em>(Sup. Jud. Ct. </em>1956), and <em>Wing v. </em>Rogers, 149 <em>Me. </em>340, 107 <em>A. 2d </em>708 <em>(Sup. Jud. Ct. </em>1953).</p>\n<p id=\"b434-4\">The court in <em>Russell </em>referred to <em>Wilkinson v. </em>Adam, 1 <em>V. &amp; B. </em>422, 466, 35 <em>Eng. Repr. </em>163, 180 <em>(Ch. </em>1812), where Lord Eldon, almost a century and a half ago, gave definitive expression to a canon of construction on which courts still rely:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-5\">\u201cWith regard to that Expression \u2018necessary Implication,\u2019 * * * in construing a Will Conjecture must not be taken for Implication: but necessary Implication means, not natural Necessity, but so strong a Probability of Intention, that an Intention contrary to that, which is imputed to the Testator, cannot be supposed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b434-7\">And see 5 <em>N. J. Practice (Clapp, Wills and Administration), </em>\u00a7 228, <em>p. </em>535 and \u00a7 108, <em>p. </em>255. In <em>Daly v. </em>Rogers, 132 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>200, 205 <em>(Ch. </em>1942), it was said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-8\">\u201cDevises by implication are not favored. There must be something more than conjecture to warrant the implication. The will itself must furnish the basis of the construction. To justify a gift by implication, the gift must rest on a probability of an intention so strong that an intention contrary to that which is thus imputed to the testator cannot be supposed to have existed in his mind. Where implications are permissible, they must be such as are at least highly probable and not merely possible implications, [citing cases]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b434-9\">Judge Clapp, in his concurring opinion in <em>In re Klein\u2019s </em>Estate, 36 <em>N. J. Super. </em>407, 416 <em>(App. Div. </em>1955), carefully reviewed the doctrine of implications and noted that two conditions must exist before an implication will be made:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-10\">\u201cIn the first place, where there has been an oversight on the testator\u2019s part, not with respect to the matter of expression, but with respect to ideas, the court can be of no aid. We may furnish <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>words, but never intentions. The first o\u00ed the two conditions then is this: an implication will not be made unless a reading of the will produces on the mind of the court a conviction that the testator at the time of the will actually and in truth had an intention to make a provision not found there, [citing cases]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-5\">The second condition is this. We must be convinced from the will not only that it contains but a fragment of the testator\u2019s actual intentions, but also that we can see, in the fragment given us, the contour of that which is not stated, [citing cases] The implication depends upon the apparency of the entire image, to some degree, from an observation of the portion that is visible. * * *\u201d 36 <em>N. J. Super., </em>at <em>pages </em>416 \u2014 417.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b435-7\">The language of the will in the <em>Bussell </em>case met the test set out in <em>Daly v. Rogers t </em>and <em>In re Klein. </em>Not so the will we here examine. It is possible that the testator intended his wife\u2019s nieces and nephews to take under his will, to the exclusion of his own niece, even if the wife should predecease him. But the merely possible is not a substitute for the highly probable \u2014 probable to the point of inescapable conviction \u2014 and we therefore are not at liberty to draw the implication which appellants urge. There is no room for misapprehending the meaning of the language which testator used, and if acceptance of that meaning leads to intestacy, we are precluded, under the <em>Glover </em>case, from preventing that result merely because the court may suppose that the testator overlooked the contingency that his wife might predecease him. <em>Cf. McDonald v. Clermont, </em>107 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>585, 588 <em>(E. </em>&amp; <em>A. </em>1931).</p>\n<p id=\"b435-8\"> The fact is that the testator, a lawyer, simply did not think of that contingency, and therefore made no express provision for it. As was said in <em>Lawes v. Lynch, </em>6 <em>N. J. </em>1, 8 (1950), it is not our function to make a will for the testator, but to construe the one which he made, \u201cand if the legal effect of his expressed intent is intestacy it will be presumed that ho designed that intent since he is presumed to know the law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b435-9\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
