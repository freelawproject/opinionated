Patent Office affirming a decision of the examiner rejecting, for want of patentability over the cited prior\" art, appellant\u2019s, application for a design patent. The re-, jected claim reads as follows: \u201cThe ornamental design for a cleaning, scouring and polishing pad substantially as shown.\u201d \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b742-23\">The references cited are:</p>\n<p id=\"b742-24\">Ross, Des. 36,287, April 14, 1903.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-25\">Montgomery et al., 1,192,219, July 25,. 1916.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-26\">Ebert et al., 2,012,500, August 27, 1935.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-27\">The scouring pad disclosed in the drawing of the application is of oval shape and has a flaky surface having no marginal or surface ornamentation. It is relatively thick at the center and tapers gradually toward its edges.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-28\">The patent to Ross discloses an oval cake-of soap having marginal scrolls.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-29\">The patent to Montgomery et al. shows a plurality of fibers made into a smoothing-pad somewhat oval in shape. This is not a design patent.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-30\">The patent to Ebert et al. is a mechanical patent and relates to a manipulator for scouring pads, but discloses a scouring pad' circular in shape. Appellant claims that the showing of the pad was accidental and is for that reason not a proper reference. In this, however, appellant is mistaken for the pad is not only shown in the drawing, but is described in the written specification.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-31\">\"The decision of the Board of Appeals, is very short and reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-32\">\u201cThe question involved in this appeal is whether it would be obvious to change the design of the circular cleaning pad shown in Ebert et al. to the generally oval shape-shown in Ross.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-33\">\u201cWe have carefully considered appellant\u2019s argument. We believe, however,, particularly as the Ebert et al. and Ross patents both disclose articles intended for cleaning purposes, that any one familiar with both forms would receive the suggestion of modifying one in view of the-: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>other. It is our opinion, therefore, that appellant\u2019s change is devoid of invention.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-4\">\u201cThe decision of the examiner is affirmed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b743-5\">We are in full accord with the views expressed by the Board of Appeals. A design, to be patentable, must involve the inventive faculty. We are of the opinion that the selection of the form of pad disclosed by appellant involved only the exercise of ordinary skill in view of the Ebert and Ross patents. Appellant contends that the Ross patent relates to a non-analogous art. That patent, however, like the application before us, relates to articles intended for cleaning purposes and clearly is a proper reference.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-6\">Since we are in agreement with the views expressed by the Board of Appeals, its decision is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b743-8\">GARRETT, Presiding Judge</author>\n<p id=\"AGL\">(specially concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b743-9\">I have doubt with respect to the pertinency of the Ross patent as a reference, but none with respect to the correctness of the conclusion reached.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
