GARZA, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b626-12\">I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b626-13\">This is an insurance coverage dispute that arose from a copyright infringement case. The underlying copyright litigation began in July 1996, when Delta Computer Corporation (\u201cDCC\u201d) filed suit alleging that Delta Computer Leasing, LM Data, Walter L. Frank and other partners of LM Data, Telephone Electronics Corporation (\u201cTEC\u201d), and thirty TEC subsidiaries, misappropriated DCC\u2019s copyrighted computer software. DCC developed, for the purpose of generating long distance resale bills, a computer program to record the identity of long distance callers and the length of long distance calls. The computer program also allowed for the inclusion of advertisements along with the text of the bills.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-15\">The TEC parties, defendants and third party plaintiffs, filed suit against United States Fire Insurance Company (\u201cUS Fire\u201d), alleging that DCC\u2019s claim against the TEC parties was covered under its Commercial General Liability Coverage policy. US Fire denied that the policy insured the TEC parties against DCC\u2019s claim and filed a motion for summary judgment, which the District Court granted. The underlying dispute between DCC and the TEC parties has since been settled without the participation of U.S. Fire. This appeal of the District Court\u2019s ruling on U.S. Fire\u2019s motion for summary judgment followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-16\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b626-17\">Courts of Appeals review summary judgments <em>de novo, </em>applying the same standard as the district courts. Fed. R.Civ.P. 56. If the pleadings, answers to interrogatories, admissions and affidavits on file indicate no genuine issue as to any material fact, the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Little v. Liquid Air Corp., </em>37 F.3d 1069, 1075 (5th Cir.1994) (en banc); Fed.R.Civ.P. 56. When the burden at trial rests on the nonmovant, the movant must merely demonstrate an absence of evidentiary support in the record for the nonmovant\u2019s case. <em>Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, </em>477 U.S. 317, 324, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b626-18\">Courts consider the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmovant, yet the nonmovant may not rely on mere allegations in the pleadings; rather, the nonmov-ant must respond to the motion for summary judgment by setting forth particular facts indicating that there is a genuine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>issue for trial. <em>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., </em>477 U.S. 242, 248-49, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986). After the nonmovant has been given an opportunity to raise a genuine factual issue, if no reasonable juror could find for the nonmovant, summary judgment will be granted. <em>Celotex Corp., </em>477 U.S. at 322, 106 S.Ct. 2548; Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b627-4\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"ASV\">Under controlling Louisiana substantive law, courts must determine coverage and the duty to defend based solely upon the factual allegations on the face of the complaint as compared with the terms of the policy. <em>Bryant v. Motwani, </em>683 So.2d 880 (1996). When a complaint alleges facts that, if assumed to be true, would support a claim for which coverage is not unambiguously excluded, the duty to defend arises. <em>Complaint of Stone Petroleum Corp., </em>961 F.2d 90 (5th Cir.1992). There must be a potential for recovery by the plaintiff as well as coverage under the policy for the insurer to be bound by a duty to defend. <em>American Home Assurance Company v. Czarniecki, </em>255 La. 251, 230 So.2d 253 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">Under the insurance policy terms, U.S. Fire agreed to cover the TEC parties against advertising injury liability.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Fifth Circuit, applying Texas law and considering policy language identical to that presently at issue, held that a policy covering advertising injuries <em>in the course of advertising </em>the insured\u2019s products or services did not cover a complaint alleging that the insured infringed the plaintiffs copyrights by using its written work without authorization. <em>Sentry Insurance v. RJ. Weber Co., Inc., </em>2 F.3d 554 (5th Cir.1993). The Court found that there must be a connection between the copyright claims and the insured\u2019s advertising activity. <em>Sentry Insurance, </em>2 F.3d at 557.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-13\">No such causal connection exists in the case at bar, and the coverage requirements of Louisiana law are not met because the underlying pleading states nothing about advertising. DCC did not complain of any injury suffered in the course of the TEC parties\u2019 advertising, nor could a reference to advertising be fairly inferred from the language of the pleadings; rather, DCC\u2019s claim is essentially for infringement of its copyrighted software program, which was developed primarily for billing purposes, not for advertising activity. Although the software included a feature that allowed the bills generated to include advertisements, any advertising done through use of the software is incidental to DCC\u2019s core complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-14\">In <em>Sentry Insurance, </em>2 F.3d at 557, this court held that there was no link to any advertising activities as a matter of law because the injury could have occurred independent of any advertising by the appellants. In the present case, DCC\u2019s copyright infringement claim stands on its own because even if the TEC parties had never discovered or used the software advertising feature in the course of their billing activity, DCC could still have suffered the same injury and asserted the same software copyright infringement claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-15\">This court therefore concludes as a matter of law that U.S. Fire has no duty to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>defend the TEC parties and that DCC\u2019s underlying claims are excluded from coverage by the insurance policy\u2019s advertising injury liability provisions. Accordingly, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b627-6\">. The policy provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AdVV\">This insurance applies to: ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A4rb\">(2) \"Advertising injury\u201d caused by an offense committed in the course of advertising your goods, products or services; ... (R. 69, exh. A)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A4s\">The policy also states that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AN-I\">\u201cAdvertising injury\u201d means injury arising out of one or more of the following offenses:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Agr\">a.Oral or written publication or material that slanders or libels a person or organization or disparages a person's or organization\u2019s goods, products or services.;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-17\">b.
