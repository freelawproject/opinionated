Specifically, he asserts that the district court erred in concluding that it did not have the discretion to depart downward from the recommended sentence as calculated under the United States Sentencing Guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b1360-7\">On December 4, 1998, Alfaro-Zayas pled guilty to re-entry of a deported alien. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1326(a), (b)(2). The Presen-tence Investigation Report (\u201cPSI\u201d) classified his 1992 conviction for transportation/ sale of cocaine base (the \u201c1992 drug conviction\u201d) as an aggravated felony under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(B) and 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 802.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> During the sentencing hearing, the court accepted the 1992 drug conviction as an aggravated felony sufficient to support a sixteen-level increase in the base level of the current offense under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A). Consequently, the court found the total offense level to be twenty-one. The PSI also listed Alfaro-Zayas\u2019s prior convictions for assault with a deadly weapon, battery, automobile burglary, as well as an earlier conviction for re-entry of a deported alien and accorded him a total of eighteen criminal history points, placing Alfaro-Zayas in Category VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b1360-8\">During the sentencing hearing, Alfaro-Zayas\u2019s counsel made an oral motion requesting that the court reconsider the 1992 drug conviction and make a downward departure in the offense level because it overstated the seriousness of his criminal conduct. Defense counsel explained that Alfaro-Zayas\u2019s conduct underlying the 1992 drug conviction and his classification as an aggravated felon was a twenty-dollar sale of cocaine base. He argued that the court had the authority to grant his motion and make a downward departure under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3 (1998).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1360-12\">The district court denied the motion to depart downward because it found that \u00a7 4A1.3 was inapplicable. The court further concluded that it did not have the discretion to depart downward from the Sentencing Guidelines because to do so would \u201ceffectively just cross[ ] out a prior conviction,\u201d R2-32, and require the court to \u201csimply cast[ ] the sentencing guidelines aside.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 30. Alfaro-Zayas appeals the court\u2019s conclusion that it had no discretion to depart downward given his status as an aggravated felon.</p>\n<p id=\"b1360-13\">Generally, \u201cdecisions by a district court not to depart downward from the prescribed sentencing guidelines range\u201d are not reviewable on appeal. <em>United States v. Rudisill, </em>187 F.3d 1260, 1265 (11th Cir.1999). \u201cSuch decisions are reviewable, however, if the district court denies the downward departure because of an erroneous belief that the court lacked the authority to make such a departure.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1360-14\">Alfaro-Zayas urges this court to extend our reasoning in <em>United States v. Webb, </em>139 F.3d 1390 (11th Cir.1998), to find that a sentencing court has the authority to depart downward pursuant to \u00a7 4A1.3 when the sentence has been in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1341\">*1341</page-number>creased under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> because the defendant was previously convicted of an aggravated felony. In <em>Webb, </em>we held that \u201cgiven the appropriate factual determinations,\u201d 139 F.3d at 1396, \u00a7 4A1.3 does authorize a sentencing court to downward depart \u201cregardless of a defendant\u2019s status as a career offender under \u00a7 4B1.1,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 1395. The reasoning in Webb. does not support the conclusion that \u00a7 4A1.3 authorizes downward departure by the sentencing court when the defendant has been classified as an aggravated felon under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b1361-4\">Although \u00a7\u00a7 4A1.3 and 2L1.2(b)(1)(A) both deal with a defendant\u2019s past criminal acts, they do so for different purposes. Chapter Four of the Sentencing Guidelines designates the criminal history category, while Chapter Two defines offense conduct.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Section 4A1.3 provides for horizontal departure to a different criminal history category when the sentencing court determines that the defendant\u2019s <em>\u201ccriminal history category </em>does not adequately reflect the seriousness of the defendant\u2019s past criminal conduct or the likelihood that the defendant will commit other crimes.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3, p.s. (emphasis added). In this case, Alfaro-Zayas does not argue that his criminal history category is not reflective of his past conduct. Instead, Alfaro-Zayas suggests that his underlying conviction for possession/ transportation of cocaine should not be considered an aggravated felony under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A). In the past, we have only applied \u00a7 4A1.3 \u201cto a pattern of criminal conduct, not to an individual crime\u201d as Alfaro-Zayas suggests we do here. <em>United States v. Phillips, </em>120 F.3d 227, 232 (11th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b1361-10\">Deviation from the offense levels assigned in \u00a7 2L1.2 requires the sentencing court to progress along the vertical axis of the sentencing table to a different offense level.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> \u201cThis court has distinguished between \u2018horizontal\u2019 and \u2018vertical\u2019 departures.\u201d <em>United States v. Melvin, </em>187 F.3d 1316, 1323 n. 3 (11th Cir.1999). Section 4A1.3 provides the sentencing court the discretion to move along the horizontal axis of the sentencing table when it believes the criminal history category assigned by the Sentencing Guidelines is not appropriate; however, this section does not authorize the sentencing court to adjust the offense level when the court finds that the underlying conduct does not support the assigned offense level.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Thus, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1342\">*1342</page-number>district court correctly concluded that \u00a7 4A1.3 was not applicable to Alfaro-Zayas\u2019s motion that the court depart downward because his 1992 drug conviction should not be considered an aggravated felony under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b1362-4\">While not empowered under \u00a7 4A1.3, the district court did have the authority under \u00a7 2L1.2 to evaluate the aggravated felony which triggered the increase in Alfaro-Zayas\u2019s offense level and to depart downward if the seriousness of the underlying aggravated felony warranted such a departure. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, comment, (n. 5) (hereinafter \u201capplication note five\u201d). Specifically, application note five provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1362-5\">Aggravated felonies that trigger the adjustment from subsection (b)(1)(A) vary widely. If subsection (b)(1)(A) applies, and (A) the defendant has previously been convicted of only one felony offense; (B) such offense was not a crime of violence or firearms offense; and (C) the term of imprisonment imposed for such offense did not exceed one year, a downward departure may be warranted based on the seriousness of the aggravated felony.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1362-6\"><em>Id. </em>This comment explains that, when the sentencing court finds the delineated factors within a case, that case may not be within the \u201cheartland\u201d of the Sentencing Guidelines and the court may consider whether departure is warranted. <em>See </em>1998 U.S.S.G. Ch. 1, Pt. A., intro, comment (4(b)); <em>see also Koon v. United States, </em>518 U.S. 81, 92, 116 S.Ct. 2035, 2044, 135 L.Ed.2d 392. 518 U.S. 81, 116 S.Ct. 2035, 135 L.Ed.2d 392 (1996). Further, application note five suggests that, when the three factors identified are all present in a given case, that case is more apt to be atypical and the sentencing court is encouraged to make a downward departure based on those features. <em>Koon, </em>518 U.S. at 94, 116 S.Ct. at 2045; <em>see also United States v. Diaz-Diaz, </em>135 F.3d 572, 581 (8th Cir.1998) (finding that application note five made \u201cthe \u2018seriousness of the aggravated felony\u2019 ... an encouraged factor upon which a departure may be based\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1362-9\">All the elements of application note five are not present in Alfaro-Zayas\u2019s case. While we cannot operate as factfinders, it is evident from the record that Alfaro-Zayas has been convicted of more than one felony. <em>See </em>PSI at pp. 5-9. These prior convictions remove Alfaro-Zayas\u2019s case from the realm for which departures are encouraged by application note five without any further inquiry into the seriousness of the predicate felony conviction. <em>See United States v. Chavez-Valenzuela, </em>170 F.3d 1038 (10th Cir.1999) (finding \u00a7 2L1.2, comment, (n. 5) inapplicable to a motion for downward departure when one of the three stated elements is not present).</p>\n<p id=\"b1362-10\">While Alfaro-Zayas\u2019s case does not present the combination of factors upon which the Sentencing Commission has encouraged departure, Alfaro-Zayas requested that the court consider the amount of the drugs involved in his 1992 drug conviction as a basis for departure. The amount of drugs involved in a drug conviction is not a factor the Sentencing Commission has prohibited or discouraged a sentencing court from considering when determining whether to depart from the recommended sentence. \u201c[A] sentencing court may depart on the basis of a factor not addressed by the Sentencing Commission if the court determines that the factor takes the case out of the Guideline\u2019s heartland after considering the \u2018structure and theory of both the relevant individual guidelines and the Guidelines taken as a whole.\u2019 \u201d <em>Melvin, </em>187 F.3d at 1321 (quoting <em>Koon, </em>518 U.S. at 109, 116 S.Ct. at 2035).</p>\n<p id=\"b1362-11\">Therefore, the district court could have departed downward if, after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1343\">*1343</page-number>engaging in the analysis required by <em>Koon, </em>it found circumstances that removed Alfaro-Zayas\u2019s case from the heartland of the Sentencing Guidelines. <em>See United States v. Sanchez-Rodriguez, </em>161 F.3d 556, 563 (9th Cir.1998) (en banc) (concluding that, under the <em>Koon </em>analysis, the district court may consider the nature of the aggravated felony when deciding whether to depart downward from the Guideline\u2019s sentencing range).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>See also United States v. Robles-Medina, </em>No. 98-4172, 1999 WL 417630 (10th Cir. June 23, 1999) (finding that, under <em>Koon </em>and U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(B), \u201cthe seriousness of the \u2018aggravated felony\u2019 may be a valid basis for downward departure.\u201d)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>. A sentencing court determines whether a case falls outside the heartland of the Sentencing Guidelines by carefully assessing the facts of the case and \u201ccomparing those facts to the facts of other cases falling within the guideline\u2019s heartland.\u201d <em>United States v. Hoffer, </em>129 F.3d 1196, 1200 (11th Cir.1997) In this circuit, a sentencing court \u201cmust articulate the specific mitigating circumstances upon which it relies and the reasons why these circumstances take a case out of the guidelines\u2019 heartland.\u201d <em>United States v. Tomono, </em>143 F.3d 1401, 1403 (11th Cir.1998) (per curiam). \u201cMoreover, the court must bear in mind the Commission\u2019s expectation that departures based on grounds not mentioned in the Guidelines will be highly infrequent.\u201d <em>United States v. Steele, </em>178 F.3d 1230, 1238 (11th Cir.1999) (internal quotations and citations omitted), cert. denied, \u2014 U.S. \u2014, 120 S.Ct. 335, 145 L.Ed.2d 261 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b1363-8\">Here, the district court made no findings of any circumstances that remove Alfaro-Zayas\u2019s case from the heartland of \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A). Instead, the court expressed its frustration with the sentence called for by the guidelines:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1363-9\">Now, my personal view of that is that that is madness....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1363-10\">I just think it makes very good sense that before people are required to spend these tremendous periods in jail that there be some reasonable period in jail in an effort to deter that conduct....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AG3\">I don\u2019t understand any principled way that I can depart downward other than sort of a gut feeling that, yes, this sounds like a terribly harsh sentence and I ought to disregard what seem to be the predicates.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1363-11\">I don\u2019t think I can do that ... short of simply casting the sentencing guidelines aside. So I am going to deny the motion to depart downward.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1363-12\">R2-27, 29 \u2014 30. We have recognized that \u201c[disagreement with the policy choices underlying the Sentencing Guidelines and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1344\">*1344</page-number>sentencing statutes is not a ground for downward departure.\u201d <em>United States v. Gilbert, </em>138 F.3d 1371, 1373 (11th Cir.1998) (per curiam), cert. denied, \u2014 U.S. \u2014, 119 S.Ct. 1754, 143 L.Ed.2d 787 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b1364-6\">Although there were several potential bases which authorize the district court to depart downward from the sentence calculated for Alfaro-Zayas under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A), we agree with the district court that none of these bases were applicable to this case. The district court reviewed the facts of Alfaro-Zayas\u2019s case and made no findings suggesting that it fell outside the heartland of \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A). Thus, the district court was left only with a policy-based objection to the recommended sentence. The district court correctly noted that its disagreement with the policy under which Alfaro-Zayas\u2019s sentence was calculated did not provide it with authority to depart downward. Accordingly, the sentence as imposed by district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1360-9\">. Neither party disputes that the 1992 drug conviction for transportation/ sale of cocaine base meets the statutory definition of an aggravated felony. Alfaro-Zayas was sentenced to sixteen months in prison for the 1992 drug conviction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1360-10\">. The policy statement to \u00a7 4A1.3 provides that \"[i]f reliable information indicates that the criminal history category does not adequately reflect the seriousness of the defendant\u2019s past criminal conduct or the likelihood that the defendant will commit other crimes, the court may consider imposing a sentence departing from the otherwise applicable guideline range.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3, p.s.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1361-5\">. Section 2L1.2 provides a base offense level of eight for the crime unlawfully entering and remaining in the United States. Subpart (b)(1)(A) further provides that \"[i]f the defendant previously was deported after a criminal conviction, or if the defendant unlawfully remained in the United States following a removal order issued after a criminal conviction [and the conviction was for an aggravated felony], increase [the base offense level] ... . by 16 levels.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1361-7\">. \"Under the Guidelines, every sentence .is determined by a combination of an offense- and an offender-based component.... The sentencing table indicates the sentence ranges for possible combinations of offense- and offender-based components, with the horizontal axis reflecting the offender\u2019s criminal history and the vertical axis reflecting the appropriate offense level.\u201d <em>United States v. Mogel, </em>956 F.2d 1555, 1558 (11th Cir.1992).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1361-8\">. U.S.S.G., Chapter Two assigns \"varying offense level adjustments to circumstances that differentiate two instances of a nominally identical offense in the eyes of the relevant penological goals, retribution and general deterrence.\u201d <em>Mogel, </em>956 F.2d at 1559. The enhancement provided for under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A) is consistent with 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326 which provides an increased maximum sentence for unlawful re-entry of a deported felon where the reason for the prior deportation was the alien's conviction of an aggravated felony. This suggests a \u201cCongressional judgement\u201d that \"the severity of the crime of reentry depends on the reasons for the initial deportation,\u201d <em>United States v. Campbell, </em>967 F.2d 20, 24 (2d Cir.1992), and \"the prior conviction is a critical part of what makes the current reentry wrongful.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 25.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1361-12\">.Section 4A1.3 does authorize vertical departures when the sentencing court reaches the highest criminal history category and still finds that the category does not adequately reflect the seriousness of the defendant's previous conduct. At that point, the court may depart by moving vertically along the chart to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1342\">*1342</page-number>a higher offense level, thereby yielding a longer imprisonment range. <em>See United States v. Taylor, </em>88 F.3d 938, 947-948 (11th Cir.1996).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1363-5\">. Alfaro-Zayas urged the district court to consider the small amount of cocaine involved in his 1992 drug conviction as a basis for justifying a downward departure in his sentence. The government argued that the district court was prohibited from considering the quantum of drugs involved in the predicate aggravated felony by our decision in <em>United States v. Rucker, </em>171 F.3d 1359 (11th Cir.1999) (distinguishing <em>Sanchez-Rodriguez </em>and holding that a sentencing court may not depart downward from the USSG \u00a7 4B1.4 Armed Career Criminal Guideline based upon its conclusion that, although the defendant\u2019s prior convictions fell within the statutory definition of serious drug offenses, they involved only small amounts of drugs and therefore were minor). We note that, while our decision in <em>Rucker </em>is informative to this case, it is not despositive. The analysis required by <em>Koon </em>necessitates that the structure and theory of the \"relevant individual guideline\u201d be considered to determine whether a particular circumstance takes the case out of the Sentencing Guidelines\u2019 heartland. <em>Koon, </em>518 U.S. at 96, 116 S.Ct. at 2045. Alfaro-Zayas was sentenced under sentencing guideline \u00a7 2L1.2 while <em>Rucker </em>involved \u00a7 4B1.4. We further note that, in other contexts, we have held that the Sentencing Guidelines do not preclude a district court from considering the amount of drugs as a factor. <em>See e.g., United States v. De Varon, </em>175 F.3d 930, 943 (11th Cir.1999) (en banc) (finding that the Sentencing Guidelines are not \"intended to preclude a district court from considering the amount of drugs as a factor in the context of minor participants\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1363-14\">. <em>Robles-Medina </em>is an unpublished opinion cited solely for its persuasive value pursuant to the terms and conditions of 10th Cir.
