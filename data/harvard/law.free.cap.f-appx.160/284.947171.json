Wright\u2019s counsel filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), challenging Wright\u2019s sentence but stating that, in his view, there are no meritorious issues for appeal. Wright was informed of her right to file a pro se supplemental brief but has not done so. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-10\">Counsel asserts that, in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), the 120-month statutory mandatory minimum sentence Wright received is too harsh. Wright\u2019s claim is foreclosed by our decision in <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>404 F.3d 850, 862 (4th Cir.) (\u201cEven ... after <em>Booker, </em>... a district court has <em>no </em>discretion to impose a sentence outside of the statutory range established by Congress for the offense of conviction.\u201d), cer<em>t. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 288, \u2014 L.Ed.2d-(2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b309-12\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record for any meritorious issues and have found none. Accordingly, we affirm Wright\u2019s conviction and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of her right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-13\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
