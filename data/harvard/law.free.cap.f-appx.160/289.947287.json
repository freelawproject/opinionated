By this appeal, Williamson makes two contentions: (1) that his sentence was imposed in contravention of the Sixth Amendment; and (2) that the sentencing court erroneously cross-referenced the attempted murder provision of the United States Sentencing Guidelines (the \u201cGuidelines\u201d) in calculating Williamson\u2019s sentence. As explained below, we vacate Williamson\u2019s sentence because it was imposed in violation of the Sixth Amendment, and we do not address his Guidelines calculation claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-16\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-17\">On July 23, 2002, the grand jury charged Williamson with being a felon in possession of a firearm, in contravention of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1). Williamson had pleaded guilty pursuant to a plea agreement, and his presentence report (\u201cPSR\u201d) assigned him a base offense level of 14 and placed him in criminal history category V. The PSR recommended an enhancement because the firearm at issue was stolen, an enhancement for using the firearm in connection with another felony offense, and a reduction for acceptance of responsibility. Williamson accepted the PSR\u2019s recommendation but the Government objected, asserting that the court should cross-reference \u00a7 2A2.1(a)(l) of the Guidelines because Williamson used the firearm in an attempted murder. After hearing testimony from the alleged victim, the court agreed with the Government and cross-referenced \u00a7 2A2.1 (a)(1) in calculating Williamson\u2019s sentence. It therefore assigned Williamson an offense level of 28, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>which it then reduced to 25 for acceptance of responsibility. Combining offense level 25 with criminal history category Y yielded a sentencing range of 100 to 125 months, and the court sentenced Williamson to 100 months in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">Williamson has timely noted his appeal and we possess jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-7\">Williamson asserts on appeal that his sentence was imposed in contravention of the Sixth Amendment because it is supported by judicially found facts.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Because Williamson failed to object at sentencing on Sixth Amendment grounds, however, our review of his claim is for plain error only. <em>See United States v. Ebersole, </em>411 F.3d 517, 534 (4th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b315-8\">In <em>United States v. Booker, </em>the Supreme Court concluded that the Sixth Amendment prohibits judicial factfinding under a mandatory guidelines regime that results in a sentence greater than the maximum justified solely by the facts found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt or admitted by the defendant. <em>See </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 750, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005); <em>see also United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 547 (4th Cir.2005) (\u201c[A] sentence exceeding the maximum allowed based solely on the facts found by the jury [or admitted by the defendant] violates the Sixth Amendment.\u201d). In light of the <em>Booker </em>mandate, Williamson\u2019s sentence contravened the Sixth Amendment. By his plea agreement, Williamson admitted only to being a felon in possession of a firearm. That admission alone supports a base offense level of 14, which combined with criminal history category V yields a sentencing range of 33 to 41 months. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(6) (2002). Based on its finding that Williamson used the firearm in an attempted murder, the sentencing court cross-referenced \u00a7 2A2.1(a)(l) and sentenced Williamson to 100 months. Because Williamson\u2019s sentence exceeded that which the admitted facts would have supported, it was imposed in contravention of the Sixth Amendment. And such a Sixth Amendment error constitutes reversible plain error. <em>See Hughes, </em>401 F.3d at 547 (concluding that sentence imposed in contravention of defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to jury trial is plainly erroneous and warrants relief).</p>\n<p id=\"b315-12\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-13\">Pursuant to the foregoing, we vacate Williamson\u2019s sentence and remand for such resentencing proceedings as may be appropriate.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b315-14\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b315-9\">. The Government contends on appeal that Williamson waived his Sixth Amendment claim in his plea agreement by stating his \u201cunderstand [ing]\u201c that he would be sentenced in conformity with the Guidelines. <em>See </em>Appellee\u2019s Br. at 7. We disagree with the Government\u2019s contention. Although we have recognized that a defendant\u2019s explicit waiver of the <em>right to appeal </em>a sentence imposed within the statutory maximum constitutes a waiver of his Sixth Amendment sentencing claims, <em>see United States v. Blick, </em>408 F.3d 162, 172 (4th Cir.2005), we have never held that an \"understanding\u201d that a sentence would be imposed in a particular manner constitutes a waiver of appeal rights. We observe that the Second Circuit has recently rejected a similar contention. <em>See United States v. Hamdi, </em>432 F.3d 115, 122-124 (2d Cir.2005) (concluding that defendant\u2019s \u201dagree[ment]\u201d to be sentenced under the Guidelines did not waive right to appeal sentence).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b315-17\">. Because we vacate Williamson's sentence on Sixth Amendment grounds, we do not reach his contention that the sentencing court erred in applying the \u00a7 2A2.1(a)(1) cross-ref<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>erence. <em>See Hughes, </em>401 F.3d at 556 n. 15 (observing that we need not address Guidelines calculations claims in every case involving error under <em>Booker).</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
