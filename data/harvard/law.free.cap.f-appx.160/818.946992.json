(\u201cABB\u201d). On appeal, O\u2019Brien asserts (1) the district court prematurely granted ABB\u2019s motion for summary judgment prior to the start of discovery, and (2) the district court erred by entering summary judgment on her claims based on the existence of a written contract. In her brief, she also requests this Court \u201cto stay execution\u201d of the district court\u2019s award of fees and costs, pending our decision on her challenge to the summary judgment. After careful review, we dismiss the appeal as to the summary judgment, based on our lack of jurisdiction, and we affirm the order awarding fees and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-13\">It is well-settled that absent the filing of a timely notice of appeal (\u201cNOA\u201d), we lack jurisdiction over an appeal. <em>Wooden v. Bd. of Regents of Univ. Sys. of Ga., </em>247 F.3d 1262, 1272 (11th Cir.2001); <em>Bogle v. Orange County Bd. of County Com\u2019rs, </em>162 F.3d 653, 660 (11th Cir.1998); <em>Zipperer ex rel. Zipperer v. Sch. Bd. of Seminole County, </em>111 F.3d 847, 849 (11th Cir.1997). Thus, as a federal court of limited jurisdiction, we must determine <em>sua sponte </em>whether we have jurisdiction. <em>Wooden, </em>247 F.3d at 1271; <em>see also Cadet v. Bulger, </em>377 F.3d 1173, 1179 (11th Cir.2004) (\u201cFederal courts are obligated to inquire into subject-matter jurisdiction <em>sua sponte </em>whenever it may be lacking.\u201d (quotation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b843-14\">The procedural history relevant to our jurisdictional analysis is straightforward. O\u2019Brien filed this action in the Circuit Court of the Eleventh Judicial Circuit, in and for Miami-Dade County, and ABB removed the case to federal court. Pursuant to ABB\u2019s motion, the district court entered summary judgment on June 14, 2004. On that same date, in a different order, the court entered final judgment and closed the case. It is undisputed that: (1) at that point, pursuant Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1)(A), O\u2019Brien had 30 days, or until July 14, 2004, in which to file her NOA, <em>see </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1)(A) (providing that NOA in a civil case where the United States is not a party must be filed within 30 days after the judgment or order appealed from is entered); and (2) O\u2019Brien did not file her NOA, or move for an extension of time to do so, during that 30-day period.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-15\">Thereafter, on July 14, 2004, ABB filed a verified motion for attorneys\u2019 fees and costs, seeking $41,256.00 in fees and $1,970.56 in costs, pursuant to the parties\u2019 written contract which provided for an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"820\">*820</page-number>award of \u201cprevailing party\u201d fees. On July 26, 2004, which was 41 days after the entry of summary judgment, O\u2019Brien filed a memorandum in opposition to ABB\u2019s fees and costs request. In this memorandum, O\u2019Brien, <em>inter alia, </em>(1) challenged the district court\u2019s entry of summary judgment as premature; (2) asserted that the written contract upon which the district court relied in entering summary judgment allowed for her equitable claims to proceed; (3) stated that counsel had not appealed the summary judgment for tactical, albeit erroneous, reasons; and (4) summarily mentioned that if the court considered the issues of fees, it should also \u201cextend the time for review of the entire case, de novo, on equitable grounds because the \u2018ends of justice\u2019 so require.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b844-4\">On February 24, 2005, the magistrate judge to whom the motion for fees and costs was assigned issued a Report and Recommendation (\u201cR <em>&amp; </em>R\u201d), recommending that ABB\u2019s motion be granted in part. The magistrate judge recommended awarding $24,477.00 in fees and $1,970.56 in costs. In her order, the magistrate judge observed that counsel\u2019s reasons for not appealing from the summary judgment were not relevant to the issue of ABB\u2019s entitlement to fees and costs. In a footnote, the magistrate judge stated: \u201cPlaintiff argues that if the Defendant is awarded attorney\u2019s fees, the Court should extend Plaintiffs time to file a notice of appeal. This issue is not presently ripe and will not be considered here. <em>Plaintiff may make an appropriate motion if attorney\u2019s fees are awarded.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added). It is undisputed that, prior to filing her NOA, O\u2019Brien did not file anything further in the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-8\">On March 15, 2005, the district court adopted the R &amp; R, thereby granting ABB\u2019s motion for fees and costs in part. Thereafter, on April 11, 2005, O\u2019Brien filed her NOA, enumerating that she was appealing \u201cthe judgment of the United States District Court Southern District of Florida entered on March 15, 2005 in the above-captioned case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b844-9\">O\u2019Brien now attempts to challenge the June 14, 2004 summary judgment on numerous grounds. We conclude that we lack jurisdiction to consider her arguments. \u201cThe timely filing of a notice of appeal is \u2018mandatory and jurisdictional.\u2019 If the notice is not timely filed, the appellate court is without jurisdiction to hear the appeal.\u201d <em>Advanced Estimating Sys., Inc. v. Riney, </em>77 F.3d 1322, 1323 (11th Cir.1996) (quoting <em>Griggs v. Provident Consumer Disc. Co., </em>459 U.S. 56, 61, 103 S.Ct. 400, 403, 74 L.Ed.2d 225 (1982)). While it is true, as O\u2019Brien urges, that a district court may extend the time for filing the NOA, from our careful review of the record, it is clear that O\u2019Brien never moved for, and the district court never granted her, such an extension. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(5) (enumerating requirements for <em>motion </em>for extension of time). Accordingly, her April 11, 2005 NOA was untimely to appeal from the June 14, 2004 order of summary judgment and we dismiss that portion of her appeal.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b845-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"821\">*821</page-number>As for O\u2019Brien\u2019s remaining claim, we affirm the award of fees and costs because O\u2019Brien\u2019s argument on this point consists solely of requesting us \u201cto stay execution\u201d of the award of fees and costs, pending our disposition of the appeal as to the summary judgment. Given our dismissal of the appeal from the summary judgment, that argument is moot. Accordingly, we affirm the award of fees and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-5\">DISMISSED IN PART AND AFFIRMED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b844-5\">. For this proposition O'Brien cited <em>CNA Fin. Corp. v. Brown, </em>162 F.3d 1334 (11th Cir. 1998), which we find inapposite. That case involved whether, following a court-annexed arbitration award, a litigant could request a trial <em>de novo </em>outside of the 30-day period for filing such a request, where allowing the litigant to do so would \"further the ends of justice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Because, unlike the time limit for filing a NOA, the limitations period in <em>CNA Fin. </em>was <em>not </em>jurisdictional, we affirmed the district court's allowance of the late-filed motion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b844-11\">. In addition to being untimely, O\u2019Brien\u2019s NOA is facially insufficient to challenge the order of summary judgment, which is not designated as the \u201corder appealed from.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"821\">*821</page-number>Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 3 governs the required contents of a notice of appeal and provides, <em>inter alia, </em>that the notice \"designate the judgment, order, or part thereof appealed from____\u201d Fed. R.App. P. 3(c). Here, O'Brien\u2019s NOA states she is appealing \"the judgment of the United States District Court Southern District of Florida entered on March 15, 2005 in the above-captioned case.\u201d Even after liberally construing her NOA, we are unable to extrapolate an intent to appeal from the summary judgment. In fact, our review of O\u2019Brien\u2019s memorandum in opposition to ABB\u2019s motion for fees and costs makes clear that, at that point in the district court proceedings, O\u2019Brien, at a minimum, suspected that she could not appeal the summary judgment due to the time bar we discussed above. We make this inference from that portion of the opposition memorandum in which her attorney states that he made a tactical, albeit erroneous, decision not to appeal the summary judgment order previously entered. Thus, in addition to being untimely, O'Brien\u2019s NOA is facially insufficient to challenge the summary judgment.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
