In civil actions in which the United States or an officer or agency thereof is a party, all parties are accorded sixty days after the entry of the district court\u2019s final judgment or order to note an appeal, <em>see </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1)(B), unless the district court extends the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(5), or reopens the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(6). These time periods are \u201cmandatory and jurisdictional.\u201d <em>Browder v. Dir., Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>434 U.S. 257, 264, 98 S.Ct. 556, 54 L.Ed.2d 521 (1978) (quoting <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>361 U.S. 220, 229, 80 S.Ct. 282, 4 L.Ed.2d 259 (I960)).</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">We remanded this case to the district court for the court to determine whether Singletary timely filed a motion to extend the appeal period under Rule 4(a)(5). <em>See United States v. Singletary, </em>88 Fed.Appx. 652 (4th Cir.2004) (unpublished). After reviewing the parties\u2019 arguments on remand, the magistrate judge found that prison officials collected legal mail daily on weekdays and that, because the mail log indicated the notice of appeal was accepted by the mail room on Monday, November 3, 2003, Singletary deposited the mail in the legal mail box no earlier than Friday, October 31, 2003, two days after the excusable neglect period expired. Thus, the magistrate judge apparently concluded that the appeal period could not be extended. <em>See Hensley v. Chesapeake &amp; O. Ry. Co., </em>651 F.2d 226, 228 (4th Cir.1981) (finding that expiration of time limits in Rule 4 deprives court of jurisdiction over case). The record was then returned to us for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-8\">It appears from our review of the record that the magistrate judge\u2019s order may be a dispositive ruling as it potentially ends Singletary\u2019s ability to pursue his appeal. <em>See Vitols v. Citizens Banking Co., </em>984 F.2d 168, 169-70 (6th Cir.1993) (holding that \u201ca magistrate judge, acting pursuant to ... \u00a7 636(b)(1) ..., has no authority to issue a dispositive ruling on a motion to certify a district court order for interlocutory appeal under [28 U.S.C.] \u00a7 1292(b) [ (2000) ]\u201d). Thus, the magistrate judge only is authorized under 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 636(b)(1)(B) (West Supp.2005) to make a recommendation to the district court. Once the magistrate judge files a report and recommendation, the parties have ten days to object. 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 636(b)(1)(C). A district court reviews \u201cde novo ... those portions of the report ... to which objection is made.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b358-10\">Because the parties did not have an opportunity to object to the magistrate judge\u2019s findings, we remand the case to the district court for the limited purposes of providing notice of the right to file objections and of allowing the district court to conduct the appropriate review. The record, as supplemented, will then be returned to this court for further consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-11\">\n<em>REMANDED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
