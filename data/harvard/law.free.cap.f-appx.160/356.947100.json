The district court upwardly departed to 120 months\u2019 imprisonment from Gonzales\u2019s guideline range of 70 to 87 months based on its finding that the top of the guideline range under-represented the seriousness of Gonzales\u2019s criminal history or the likelihood he would commit further crimes. Gonzales argues that the district court reversibly erred (1) by upwardly departing after considering his (a) arrests that did not result in convictions, (b) remote convictions, and (c) convictions that were used to determine his criminal history category; (2) by failing to comply with U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3(a)(4) when it determined the extent of the departure; and (3) in deciding to depart based on facts not admitted by Gonzales or found by a jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-10\">After <em>United, States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), we continue to review the interpretation and application of guidelines <em>de novo. United States v. Villegas, </em>404 F.3d 355, 359 (5th Cir.2005) (per curiam). The district court\u2019s decision to depart upward and the extent of the departure are reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Saldana, </em>427 F.3d 298, 308 (5th Cir.2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 810, 163 L.Ed.2d 637 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b381-17\">\u201cIf reliable information indicates that the defendant\u2019s criminal history category substantially under-represents the seriousness of a defendant\u2019s criminal history or the likelihood that the defendant may commit other crimes, an upward departure may be warranted.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3(a)(l). \u201cHowever, a prior arrest record itself shall not be considered under [\u00a7 4A1.3].\u201d \u00a7 4A1.3; <em>see United States v. Cantu-Dominguez, </em>898 F.2d 968, 971 (5th Cir.1990). A sentencing court incorrectly applies the guidelines where it bases a departure on an impermissible factor such as the defendant\u2019s prior arrest record. <em>Williams v. United States, </em>503 U.S. 193, 199-200, 112 S.Ct. 1112, 117 L.Ed.2d 341 (1992). The government has the burden of showing on appeal \u201cthat the district court would have imposed the same sentence absent the erroneous factor.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 203, 112 S.Ct. 1112.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-18\">The government has not argued and has thus failed to show that, absent consideration of Gonzales\u2019s arrests that did not result in convictions, the court would have imposed the same sentence. Accordingly, we VACATE the sentence and REMAND for resentencing. Consequently, we do not address Gonzales\u2019s remaining claims of <em>Booker </em>error or error under the guidelines. <em>See United States v. Southerland, </em>405 F.3d 263, 270 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b381-19\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b381-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
