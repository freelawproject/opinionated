For the first time on appeal, he claims the factual basis for his guilty plea was insufficient because it failed to state he was aware of the status of the aliens he was transporting. Pursuant to our plain error standard of review, he fails to show the requisite \u201cclear\u201d or \u201cobvious\u201d error because he has not shown it was clear or obvious the factual basis was insufficient to demonstrate that he committed the charged crime. <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 731-37, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993); <em>United States v.
