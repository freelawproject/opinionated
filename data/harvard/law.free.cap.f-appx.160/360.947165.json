Diaz, Texas prisoner # 12229485 proceeding <em>pro se </em>and <em>in for-ma pauperis </em>(IFP), appeals the dismissal of his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 action as frivolous under \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Diaz alleges the violation of his right to access to the courts<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and deliberate indifference to his medical conditions.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b385-22\">We review a dismissal of a complaint as frivolous under \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i) for an abuse of discretion.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> A district court may dismiss an IFP complaint as frivolous if it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>lacks an arguable basis in law or fact.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We have reviewed the record and find neither plain error nor abuse of discretion in the reasoning of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\">Diaz\u2019s assertions in his complaint and in the Spears<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> hearing, fail to demonstrate prejudice to his ability to prepare and transmit any necessary legal document to the court. Prisoners generally enjoy a constitutional right of access to the courts.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> However, there does not exist \u201can abstract, freestanding right to a law library or legal assistance;\u201d inmates are guaranteed \u201cthe conferral of a capability\u2014 the capability of bringing contemplated challenges to sentences or conditions of confinement before the courts.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Therefore, a prisoner must \u201cdemonstrate that the alleged shortcoming in the library or legal assistance program hindered his efforts to pursue a legal claim.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Diaz received 241 of the 260 cases he requested, and he was not convicted of the crime for which he claims to have been denied access to legal documents. The district court did not abuse its discretion, neither in finding that Diaz failed to establish actual prejudice stemming from any alleged impediment to his right of access to the courts nor, consequently, in dismissing as frivolous Diaz\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-12\">Further, Diaz\u2019s allegations in his complaint and in his <em>Spears </em>hearing fail to establish that the defendants acted with deliberate indifference to his medical needs, as prohibited by the Eighth Amendment\u2019s protection against cruel and unusual punishment.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> A finding of deliberate indifference \u201cmust rest on the facts clearly evincing \u2018wanton\u2019 actions on the part of the defendants,\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> that the defendants knew of a substantial risk of serious harm and disregarded \u201cthat risk by failing to take reasonable measures to abate it.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b386-13\">Diaz\u2019s complaint alleged the inadequacy of access to medications,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and the record does not demonstrate a wanton disregard for Diaz\u2019s health, pertaining thereto. Diaz received medical treatment, including emergency room care, medication (88 pain relief tablets in a span of twenty days), and multiple evaluations by a nurse practitioner. Diaz\u2019s deliberate indifference claim arises out of a disagreement with the medical treatment that he received \u2014 not being provided non-prescription medication on demand; such disagreement does not constitute deliberate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>indifference to medical needs.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Consequently, the district court did not abuse its discretion in dismissing Diaz\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claim, as alleged.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">Diaz is warned that the affirmance of the district court\u2019s dismissal of his complaint as frivolous constitutes a \u201cstrike\u201d for purposes of the three strikes provision, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Diaz is cautioned that if he accumulates three strikes, he will not be permitted to proceed <em>informa pauperis </em>in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED and SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b385-10\"> Pursuant to the 5TH CIR.
