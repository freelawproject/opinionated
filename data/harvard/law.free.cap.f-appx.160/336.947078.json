Jones is effectively challenging the district court\u2019s certification that he should not be granted IFP status because his appeal is not taken in good faith. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(a)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">Jones argues that the district judge should have recused himself because of his friendship with the defendant, because the judge is a material witness in this <em>Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents, </em>403 U.S. 388, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971), action, and because the judge recused himself in another case brought by Jones. Jones further argues that he is entitled to relief from judgment pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b)(6) because of the appearance of partiality and that his right to a fair trial is being violated because he is afraid to challenge the judge. Jones\u2019s arguments regarding recusal of the judge and for Rule 60(b) relief are not directed to the district court\u2019s reasons for denying him IFP status and are improper in a motion to proceed IFP. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">Jones also argues that the defendant\u2019s conduct of placing or causing to be placed information that Jones \u201csnitched\u201d in other inmates\u2019 presentence reports continuously places Jones in danger, thereby tolling the statute of limitations. The district court properly dismissed Jones\u2019s complaint as time-barred under either 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(b) or \u00a7 1915A. <em>See Ruiz v. United States, </em>160 F.3d 273, 275 (5th Cir. 1998); <em>Siglar v. Hightower, </em>112 F.3d 191, 193 (5th Cir.1997). Although Texas recognizes a continuing tort as an exception to the statute of limitations, <em>see Mitchell Energy Corp. v. Bartlett, </em>958 S.W.2d 430, 443 (Tex.App.1997), Jones has not alleged a continuing tort but only a continuing injury. <em>See Rogers v. Ardella Veigel Inter Vivos Trust No. 2, </em>162 S.W.3d 281, 290 (Tex.App.2005). Jones\u2019s appeal is lacking in arguable merit. Consequently, Jones\u2019s request for IFP status is denied, and his appeal is dismissed as frivolous pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 42.2. <em>See id.; Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-10\">The district court\u2019s dismissal of Jones\u2019s complaint as frivolous and the dismissal of his appeal as frivolous both count as strikes under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996). Additionally, Jones has at least one other strike. <em>See Jones v. Smith, </em>220 F.3d 586 (5th Cir.2000) (unpublished). Therefore, Jones is barred from proceeding IFP in any civil action or appeal brought while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g); <em>see Adepegba, </em>103 F.3d at 385.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-11\">IFP DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED; 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g) BAR IMPOSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b360-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
