After conducting a hearing pursuant to <em>Spears v. McCotter, </em>766 F.2d 179 (5th Cir.1985), <em>overruled on other grounds by Neitzke v. Williams, </em>490 U.S. 319, 824, 109 S.Ct. 1827, 104 L.Ed.2d 338 (1989), the district court dismissed the complaint as frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-18\">Proceeding in forma pauperis and pro se, Edmon contests that dismissal and moves for appointment of counsel. That motion is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-19\">Edmon contends that the district court erred by not allowing him to amend his complaint after the <em>Spears </em>hearing. This contention is frivolous. The <em>Spears </em>hearing is one of the principal means for allowing a litigant to amend his complaint by clarifying or fleshing out his allegations. <em>See Eason v. Thaler, </em>14 F.3d 8, 9 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b462-20\">Edmon also contends that the district court should have given him notice of the pending dismissal. Such a contention may be liberally construed as a claim that the district court erred in dismissing his complaint as frivolous. This claim is also frivolous. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)\u00ae (Supp.2005). Edmon urges that the district court turned the <em>Spears </em>hearing into a hearing under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56 when it considered matters out<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>side the pleadings. This claim is likewise without merit because it is based on Edmon\u2019s misapprehension that the <em>Spears </em>hearing was conducted under Rule 12(b)(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">Edmon contends that the district court should have ordered all of the defendants to be served and that the district court should have granted his motion for default judgment against those unserved defendants. Similarly, Edmon contends that the district court erred in refusing to order the unserved defendants to provide discovery to Edmon prior to the <em>Spears </em>hearing. A district court must dismiss a complaint that it determines to be frivolous. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i). Service upon the defendants prior to such a dismissal is <em>not </em>required. <em>See id. </em>Thus, Edmon\u2019s claim that the unserved defendants should have been ordered to answer his complaint and provide discovery is frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">Edmon\u2019s contention that the district court erred in refusing to subpoena Lynda Kite to testify at the <em>Spears </em>hearing is unavailing, given the district court\u2019s assumption that Edmon\u2019s allegations against Kite were true. Equally unavailing are Edmon\u2019s claims that the district court erred in dismissing parties over which it lacked jurisdiction and in refusing to impose Rule 11 sanctions on those parties. The parties over whom the court had no jurisdiction and who were the subject of Edmon\u2019s sanction motion were parties to a wholly different lawsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-8\">Edmon\u2019s appeal is without arguable merit; accordingly, it is dismissed as frivolous. <em>See </em>5th C\u00ede. R. 42.2; <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983). The district court\u2019s and our dismissals both count as strikes for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996). Edmon has already received one other strike. <em>Edmon v. Dallas County Sheriffs Dep\u2019t, </em>67 Fed.Appx. 241 (5th Cir.2003) (unpublished) (stating that \u201c[t]he dismissal of this appeal counts as a \u2018strike\u2019 for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g)\u201d). Accordingly, because Edmon has received three strikes, he shall no longer be allowed to proceed in forma pauperis in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility, unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b463-9\">\n<em>APPEAL DISMISSED; MOTION FOR APPOINTMENT OF COUNSEL DENIED; 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g) BAR IMPOSED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b462-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
