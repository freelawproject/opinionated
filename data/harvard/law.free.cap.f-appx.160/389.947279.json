Although Barber waived the right to appeal his sentence except for upward departures and a sentence exceeding the statutory maximum, the waiver does not bar his appeal. The district court incorrectly informed him that he could appeal an illegal sentence. Barber\u2019s challenge to the purportedly unlawful supervised release condition <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> is arguably a challenge to an allegedly illegal sentence. The Government concedes as much and declines to rely on the waiver. Moreover, the district court\u2019s incorrect characterization of the waiver and failure to address the specific provisions of the waiver and ensure that Barber understood them may have rendered the waiver not knowing and voluntary. <em>See United States v. Portillo, </em>18 F.3d 290, 292 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>(5th Cir.1994). For all these reasons, we conclude that the waiver does not preclude Barber\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">With respect to Barber\u2019s contention that the district court erred in ordering, as a condition of supervised release, that he cooperate with the probation officer in the collection of DNA, his claim is not ripe for judicial review in light of our holding in <em>United States v. Carmichael, </em>343 F.3d 756, 758 (5th Cir.2003), <em>cert. denied, </em>540 U.S. 1136, 124 S.Ct. 1116, 157 L.Ed.2d 943 (2004). We reject Barber\u2019s contention that <em>Carmichael </em>is distinguishable. <em>See United States v. Riascos-Cuenu, </em>428 F.3d 1100, 1102 (5th Cir.2005). Accordingly, we dismiss this portion of the appeal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">Barber\u2019s second argument, concerning the treatment of drug quantity graduations as sentencing factors rather than as elements of separate offenses under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a) and (b), is foreclosed by circuit precedent. <em>See United States v. Slaughter, </em>238 F.3d 580, 582 (5th Cir. 2000). Barber concedes as much and raises the issue solely to preserve it for further review. Thus, we affirm the judgment of the district court on this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-7\">AFFIRMED IN PART; DISMISSED IN PART FOR LACK OF JURISDICTION.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b414-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5 the Court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
