Because Mantec\u00f3n filed this appeal after the effective date of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (\u201cAEDPA\u201d), Pub.L.No. 104-32, 110 Stat. 1214 (1996), it is governed by the AEDPA\u2019s provisions. Mantec\u00f3n argues on appeal that the district court erred in construing his \u00a7 2255 motion as an unauthorized second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion. For the reasons set forth more fully below, we vacate and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-6\">Mantec\u00f3n filed the instant <em>pro se </em>\u00a7 2255 motion, arguing that his appellate counsel provided ineffective assistance of counsel either by abandoning, or by failing to pursue, certain issues on appeal. In a supporting memorandum, Mantec\u00f3n set forth the following procedural history. In 1993, Mantec\u00f3n was convicted, along with multiple codefendants, of committing various drug offenses. Mantec\u00f3n was sentenced to 300 months\u2019 imprisonment, and he directly appealed (Appeal No. 93 \u2014 1109). In 1994, however, Mantec\u00f3n requested that we stay this appeal so he could join his codefendants in seeking a new trial, pursuant to Fed.R.Crim.P. 33.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After the district court denied Mantecon\u2019s Rule 33 motion, he also appealed that decision (Appeal No. 95-4075).</p>\n<p id=\"b974-10\">In 1995, again while Mantecon\u2019s appeals were pending in this Court, he filed a motion to modify his sentence, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We stayed appellate proceedings in Appeal Nos. 93-4109 and 95-4075, pending the district court\u2019s ruling on Mantecon\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. In 1997, the district court granted Mantecon\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion in part, and it ordered that his sentence be reduced to 240 months\u2019 imprisonment. After apparently realizing that the district court lacked jurisdiction to enter this order because of his pending appeals, Mantec\u00f3n moved this Court to remand his case for resentencing. In April 1997, after concluding that the district court had acted without jurisdiction when it partially granted Mantecon\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, we remanded in Appeal No. 93-4109. On remand, the district court again (1) partially granted Mantecon\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, and (2) resentenced him to 240 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-11\">Mantec\u00f3n then filed in' the district court a motion for a downward departure, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.0. In November 1999, we (1) remanded Mantecon\u2019s case for the district court to consider his \u00a7 5K2.0 motion, and (2) stayed his other appeals. In February 2001, after conducting an evidentiary hearing, the district court denied Mantecon\u2019s \u00a7 5K2.0 motion, and Mantec\u00f3n appealed this decision, as well as the dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"951\">*951</page-number>trict court\u2019s partial denial of his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion (Appeal No. 98-4715). That same month, Mantec\u00f3n also filed in the district court a counseled motion seeking \u00a7 2255 relief, pursuant to <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Within a matter of days, however, Mantec\u00f3n moved to amend this \u00a7 2255 motion to reflect that he, instead, was seeking relief pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and that he was seeking to dismiss his \u00a7 2255 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-5\">In orders entered in June and July 2002, the district court denied this re-characterized pleading, explaining both that (1) Mantec\u00f3n had withdrawn it, and (2) his sentence did not violate Apprendi.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Moreover, on January 16, 2002, we rejected Mantecon\u2019s appellate arguments in Appeal Nos. 95-4075 and 98-4715. In July 2002, after we denied Mantecon\u2019s motion to recall the mandates in these appeals, as well as the mandate in Appeal No. 93^4109, and we denied his motion for reconsideration, he filed an untimely petition for a writ of <em>certiorari </em>in the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court denied <em>certiorari </em>on November 18, 2002. Mantec\u00f3n filed, by placing in the prison mail, the instant \u00a7 2255 motion on April 9, 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-6\">Without waiting for a response from the government, the magistrate judge issued a report and recommendation, recommending that the district court <em>sua sponte </em>dismiss this \u00a7 2255 motion as an unauthorized second or successive petition. The magistrate explained that, because Mantecon had filed a purported \u00a7 2255 motion in February 2001, the AEDPA required him to obtain our permission before filing the instant \u00a7 2255 motion. Alternatively, the magistrate summarily determined that the instant \u00a7 2255 motion, on its face, was time-barred. Mantec\u00f3n objected to this recommendation, arguing that, although his counsel had filed a \u00a7 2255 motion in 2001, he subsequently had clarified that he was relying on \u00a7 3742, and he had withdrawn the motion. Mantec\u00f3n also contended that the instant \u00a7 2255 motion, which he filed on April 9, 2003, was timely filed before his one-year limitation period for filing a \u00a7 2255 motion expired on April 16, 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-11\">On July 1, 2003, the district court summarily dismissed Manteeoris \u00a7 2255 motion as an unauthorized second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion. On July 8, 2003, Mantec\u00f3n filed a pleading labeled as a \u201cRule 60(b) Motion for Relief from Order,\u201d again arguing that he had not previously pursued a \u00a7 2255 motion. On January 28, 2005, the district court denied this motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-12\">On March 23, 2005, Mantec\u00f3n filed a notice of appeal (\u201cNOA\u201d) from the district court\u2019s orders (1) dismissing his \u00a7 2255 motion, and (2) denying his post-judgment motion. Mantec\u00f3n also filed an application for a certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d), seeking leave to argue: (1) \u201c[wjhether counsel\u2019s erroneous caption of a previous motion as a \u00a7 2255 (CR-DE#778) which counsel corrected three days later to an 18 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"952\">*952</page-number>U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a) motion (CR-DE# 780) including voluntary dismissal of the \u00a7 2255 motion, can be construed by the district court as a prior \u00a7 2255 for the purposes of 28 <em>U.S.G. \u00a7 </em>2244(b)(3)\u201d; and (2) \u201c[whether the district court had denied Mantec\u00f3n due process under the 5th Amendment by dismissing his collateral \u00a7 2255 motion.\u201d Without enumerating what issues Mantec\u00f3n could argue on appeal, the district court granted him a COA. Mantec\u00f3n primarily argues on appeal that his trial and appellate counsel provided ineffective assistance of counsel, in violation of his rights under the Sixth Amendment. He, however, also generally contends that the district court erred in <em>sua sponte </em>dismissing his \u00a7 2255 motion because the court mis-characterized it as a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion. Moreover, Mantec\u00f3n argues for the first time in reply that we should order the district court to conduct an evidentiary hearing.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b976-4\">As a preliminary matter, although neither party contests appellate jurisdiction, we are \u201cobligated to raise questions concerning our subject matter jurisdiction <em>sua sponte </em>in all cases.\u201d <em>See Boone v. Sec\u2019y, Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>377 F.3d 1315, 1316 (11th Cir.2004). The time a party has to appeal from the entry of an order or judgment in a civil case in which the government is a party is 60 days. Fed.R.App.P. 4(a)(1)(B). After the district court dismissed Mantecon\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion on July 1, 2003, Mantec\u00f3n did not file an NOA until March 23, 2005. Thus, Mantecon\u2019s NOA to challenge the \u00a7 2255 dismissal is untimely unless that time was tolled.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-7\">Mantec\u00f3n, in fact, filed a motion challenging this dismissal of the instant \u00a7 2255 motion within ten days of the court\u2019s entry of this order. Thus, regardless of how Mantec\u00f3n labeled this motion, its filing tolled the time Mantec\u00f3n had for filing an NOA from the dismissal order until January 28, 2005, when the district court issued its order denying post-judgment relief. <em>See Jackson v. Crosby, </em>375 F.3d 1291, 1295 (11th Cir.2004) (pursuant to Fed.R.App.P. 4(a)(4)(A), a timely' motion under Fed. R.Civ.P. 59(e) automatically tolls the time for filing an NOA, so that is begins to run from the date of the order denying the motion); <em>see also Finch v. City of Vernon, </em>845 F.2d 256, 258-59 (11th Cir.1988) (holding that a motion that is filed within ten business days of the entry of judgment and that asks for reconsideration of matters encompassed in the judgment should be treated as a Rule 59(e) motion, however the motion is styled). Mantec\u00f3n, therefore, timely filed his NOA on March 23, 2005, and we have jurisdiction to review the district court\u2019s order dismissing his \u00a7 2255 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-8\">Also, as a preliminary matter concerning the district court\u2019s issuance of a COA to Mantec\u00f3n, a court issuing a COA must \u201cindicate which specific issue or issues,\u201d if any, warrant a COA. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(3). Indeed, appellate review normally is limited to the issues specified in the COA. <em>Murray v. United States, </em>145 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"953\">*953</page-number>F.3d 1249, 1250-51 (11th Cir.1998). Nevertheless, we \u201cwill construe the issue specification in light of the pleadings and other parts of the record.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1251. Moreover, when a district court fails to enumerate specific issues for appeal, we have the discretion to \u201ceither remand to the district court with instructions to enumerate the issues, or [] rule which issues raised by the petitioner warrant a COA.\u201d <em>Putman v. Head, </em>268 F.3d 1223, 1227-28 (11th Cir. 2001). Thus, although the district court here did not enumerate in its COA order what issue(s) Mantec\u00f3n could raise on appeal, we conclude that (1) review is warranted on the first issue Mantec\u00f3n identified in his application for a COA, that is, whether the court erred in concluding that his \u00a7 2255 motion was second or successive; and (2) remand of that issue will render Mantecon\u2019s second constitutional claim moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-5\">We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s dismissal of a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion as second or successive. <em>McIver v. United States, </em>307 F.3d 1327, 1329 (11th Cir.2002). A federal prisoner may file a \u00a7 2255 motion \u201cupon the ground that the sentence was imposed in violation of the Constitution or laws of the United States, or that the court was without jurisdiction to impose such sentence, or that the sentence was in excess of the maximum authorized by law, or is otherwise subject to collateral attack.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. The AEDPA, however, provides that, to file a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion, the movant must file an application with the appropriate court of appeals for an order authorizing the district court to consider it. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(3)(A). If the petitioner has not obtained our authorization under \u00a7 2244(b)(3)(A), a district court lacks jurisdiction to consider a second or successive petition. <em>Farris v. United States, </em>333 F.3d 1211, 1216 (11th Cir.2003) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b977-8\">The AEDPA does not define \u201csecond or successive.\u201d <em>See generally </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. The Supreme Court, however, has recognized that some types of collateral challenges do not render subsequent petitions or motions \u201csecond or successive.\u201d <em>See Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 486-87, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 1605, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000) (holding that the dismissal of a petitioner\u2019s claims under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254, for failure to exhaust his state remedies, should not render a subsequent petition \u201csecond or successive\u201d).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Citing to <em>Slack, </em>we concluded in <em>Mclver </em>that a motion under \u00a7 2255 is not \u201csecond or successive\u201d for purposes of the AEDPA when the petitioner\u2019s previous \u00a7 2255 motion was granted solely to afford him the opportunity to file a direct criminal appeal. <em>See Mclver, </em>307 F.3d at 1332. In <em>In re Green, </em>215 F.3d 1195 (11th Cir.2000), we also concluded that a petitioner\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion challenging the petitioner\u2019s amended sentence that the court entered after it vacated his original sentence, which followed the district court\u2019s grant of an earlier \u00a7 2255 motion, was not \u201csecond or successive\u201d for purposes of the AEDPA. <em>See id. </em>at 1195-96.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-9\">In February 2001, Mantec\u00f3n filed in the district court a motion seeking \u00a7 2255 relief based on the Supreme Court\u2019s decision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"954\">*954</page-number>in <em>Apprendi. </em>Within a matter of days, however, Mantec\u00f3n moved to amend this \u00a7 2255 motion to reflect that he only was seeking relief pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a), along with moving the court to voluntarily dismiss his \u00a7 2255 motion. In denying this motion, the district court noted, at least in part, that Mantec\u00f3n had moved to withdraw it. Moreover, as the government notes on appeal, to the extent Mantec\u00f3n also was attempting to re-characterize this motion as a \u00a7 3742(a) motion, the district court lacked jurisdiction to decide it on the merits. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a). Thus, the district court should have dismissed Mantecoris February 2001 pleading, instead of denying it. We, therefore, conclude that Mantecoris February 2001 pleading was not a previous \u00a7 2255 motion for purposes of the AEDPA, and that the district court erred in <em>sua sponte </em>dismissing the instant \u00a7 2255 motion as unauthorized.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b978-4\">Finally, to the extent that the district court relied on the magistrate\u2019s alternative recommendation to dismiss the instant \u00a7 2255 motion as time-barred, and Mantec\u00f3n would not benefit by the remand of a time-barred \u00a7 2255 motion, we review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s determination as to timeliness. <em>See Jones v. United States, </em>304 F.3d 1035, 1037 (11th Cir.2002). The AEDPA established a one-year statute of limitations applicable to \u00a7 2255 motions, which begins to run from, among other dates, \u201cthe date on which the judgment of conviction becomes final.\u201d <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. If a federal prisoner does not file a timely petition for a writ of <em>certiorari </em>after the disposition of his direct appeal, such as here, his conviction becomes final on the date on which the prisoner\u2019s time for filing such a petition expires, which is 90 days after the entry of judgment on direct appeal. <em>See Clay v. United States, </em>537 U.S. 522, 532, 123 S.Ct. 1072, 1079, 155 L.Ed.2d 88 (2003). Because Mantecoris time for filing a <em>certiorari </em>petition expired on April 16, 2002, 90 days after we entered our opinion denying his direct appeals, and he filed by placing in the prison mail the instant \u00a7 2255 motion on April 9, 2003, this \u00a7 2255 motion, at least on its face, was timely filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-8\">Accordingly, we conclude that the district court erred in <em>sua sponte </em>dismissing the instant \u00a7 2255 motion as an unauthorized second or successive \u00a7 2255. We, therefore, vacate and remand for the district court to review in the first instance Mantecoris \u00a7 2255 motion.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b978-9\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b974-7\">. Rule 33 provides that, \"[u]pon the defendant\u2019s motion, the court may vacate any judgment and grant a new trial if the interest of justice so requires.\u201d <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 33(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b974-8\">. Section 3582(c)(2) provides that, \"in the case of a defendant who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 994(o) ... the court may reduce the term of imprisonment, after considering the factors set forth in [18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) ] to the extent that they are applicable, if such a reduction is consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b975-7\">. In <em>Apprendi, </em>the Supreme Court held that, \"[ojther than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>See Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 490, 120 S.Ct. at 2362-63.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b975-8\">.

As the government notes, the district court\u2019s orders denying Mantecon\u2019s \u00a7 3742 motion and granting a COA, refer to a Rule 60(b) motion that Mantecon's codefendant filed on February 27, 2002. However, because Mantec\u00f3n was not a party to the Rule 60(b) motion, it is irrelevant for our consideration.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b976-5\">. Because Mantec\u00f3n first raised this argument for the first time in his reply brief, we conclude that he has abandoned it. <em>See United States v. Smith, </em>416 F.3d 1350, 1352 n. 1 (11th Cir.) (explaining that the prudential rule of declining to consider issues not timely raised in a party\u2019s initial brief is \"well-established\u201d in this Circuit), <em>petition for cert, filed, </em>(U.S. Oct. 14, 2005) (No. 05-7283). Regardless, on remand, the district court should decide in the first instance if an evidentiary hearing is necessary. <em>See Lynn v. United States, </em>365 F.3d 1225, 1239 (11th Cir.) (explaining that \"a petitioner is <em>not </em>entitled to an evidentiary hearing ... when his claims are merely conclusory allegations unsupported by specifics ....\" (quotation omitted) (emphasis in original)), <em>cert. denied, </em>-U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 167, 160 L.Ed.2d 154 (2004).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b977-6\">.

Moreover, the <em>Slack </em>Court cited in support to <em>Stewart v.

In <em>Castro v. United States, </em>540 U.S. 375, 382-83, 124 S.Ct. 786, 792, 157 L.Ed.2d 778 (2003), the Supreme Court held that, when a district court treats as a request for collateral relief under \u00a7 2255 a motion that a <em>pro se </em>federal prisoner has labeled differently, \"the district court must notify the <em>pro se </em>litigant that it intends to recharacterize the pleading, warn the litigant that this recharacterization means that any subsequent \u00a7 2255 motion will be subject to the restrictions on 'second or successive' motions, and provide the litigant an opportunity to withdraw the motion or to amend it so that it contains all the \u00a7 2255 claims he believes he has.\u201d This holding, however, is not applicable in the instant case because Mantec\u00f3n was not proceeding <em>pro se, </em>and he, instead of the district court, originally characterized his pleading as a \u00a7 2255 motion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"AJg\">. To the extent Mantec\u00f3n has indicated in his brief on appeal that he wishes to expand the scope of his \u00a7 2255 motion to include challenges to his trial counsel's representation, on remand, he first will need to amend his \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>See Wagner v. Daewoo Heavy Industries America Corp., </em>314 F.3d 541, 542 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"955\">*955</page-number>(11th Cir.2002) <em>(en </em>banc) (concluding in the non-habeas context that, at least when a party is proceeding with counsel, \"[a] district court is not required to grant a plaintiff leave to amend his complaint <em>sua sponte </em>when the plaintiff ... never filed a motion to amend nor requested leave to amend before the district court\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
