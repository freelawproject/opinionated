R. Ginsberg, Miami, FL, for Defendant-Appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b931-7\">Anne R. Schultz, U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office, Miami, FL, for Plaintiff-Appellee.</attorneys>\n<judges data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b931-9\">Before CARNES, PRYOR and RONEY, Circuit Judges.</judges>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b931-10\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b931-11\">Steven Allen Anthony appeals his jury convictions and resulting sentences for being a felon in possession of a firearm, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(g)(1) and 924(e), and for possession of a controlled substance, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 844. Anthony makes two arguments: <em>first, </em>the district court abused its discretion in denying his motion for a new trial after the government\u2019s witness stated that Anthony had an \u201cextensive past\u201d because this unsolicited testimony was prejudicial and tainted the fundamental fairness of his trial; and <em>second, </em>this Court should certify the question of whether the defendant\u2019s prior convictions must be included in the indictment, submitted to the jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt before a court can use them to enhance a defendant\u2019s sentence as an armed career criminal under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-12\">While on duty, two detectives apprehended Anthony a little after 4:00 a.m. in Miami when they saw him running underneath an underpass with a gun in his left hand. The detectives searched Anthony and found a semi-automatic Beretta handgun in his waistband, as well as approximately $1,700 and four grams of crack in his pockets.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-14\">At the trial, in response to questions from the government\u2019s attorney during direct examination, one of the detectives testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b931-15\">Q. Now, to pick up where we left off, after you searched the defendant and found those items, what did you and Detective Villaverde do next?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b931-16\">A. At that time we placed the defendant into our vehicle and we proceeded towards the Dade County Jail.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b931-17\">Q. Did you ultimately go there?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b931-18\">A. We went to the jail, and on the way to the jail I ran the individual on our computer because we\u2019re equipped with computers in our vehicle. We realized he had an extensive past.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b931-19\">When the Anthony\u2019s attorney raised an appropriate objection to this last comment, and after discussion with the attorneys, the district court eventually gave the following curative instruction, \u2018You heard the detective indicate they found the defendant had a history with an extensive past. The parties have stipulated the defendant is a convicted felon and you are to disregard any implication by the detective\u2019s statement there is anything more beyond that stipulation by the parties.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b931-20\">When a curative instruction has been given to address some improper and prejudicial evidence, we will reverse only if the evidence is so highly prejudicial as to be incurable by the trial court\u2019s admonition. <em>United States v. Harriston, </em>329 F.3d 779, 787 n. 4 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b932-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"908\">*908</page-number>The district court did not abuse its discretion by denying Anthony\u2019s motion for a mistrial because the police detective\u2019s comment about Anthony\u2019s \u201cextensive past\u201d was not incurably prejudicial. The witness simply mentioned that information incidentally while answering another question regarding the events that had transpired after Anthony\u2019s arrest. The district court provided an explicit instruction to the jury to disregard the detective\u2019s response and to consider only the parties\u2019 stipulation that Anthony was a convicted felon. <em>See United States v. Shenberg, </em>89 F.3d 1461, 1472 (11th Cir.1996) (noting that we presume that the jury follows the district court\u2019s instructions).</p>\n<p id=\"b932-4\">The suggestion that we should certify a question to the United States Supreme Court is based on Anthony\u2019s argument that recent decisions such as <em>Shepard v. United States, </em>544 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005), has called into question the continuing validity of <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b932-7\">In <em>Almendarez-Torres, </em>the Supreme Court held that \u201c[a]n indictment must set forth each element of the crime that it charges ... [,b]ut it need not set forth factors relevant only to the sentencing of an offender found guilty of the charged crime.\u201d 523 U.S. at 228, 118 S.Ct. at 1223. The Court clarified that the government need not allege in its indictment and need not prove prior convictions beyond a reasonable doubt to use those prior convictions in enhancing a sentence. <em>See </em>523 U.S. at 228,118 S.Ct. at 1223. Prior to the series of decisions relating to sentenc<em>ing, </em>\u2014 Apprendi <em>v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 749-51, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004) \u2014we held that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was good law. <em>See United States v. Marseille, </em>377 F.3d 1249, 1257 (11th Cir.2004). After <em>Booker, </em>we held that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>\u201cwas left undisturbed by <em>Apprendi, Blakely, </em>and <em>Booker, \u201d </em>and that \u201ca district court does not err by relying on prior convictions to enhance a defendant\u2019s sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Shelton, </em>400 F.3d 1325, 1329 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b932-10\">Defendant properly notes in his brief that this Court directly addressed the argument that <em>Shepard v. United States, </em>544 U.S.-, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005) \u201cmay arguably cast doubt on the future prospects of Almendarez-Torres\u2019s holding regarding prior convictions\u201d but then we held that \u201cthe Supreme Court has not explicitly overruled <em>Almendarez-Torres.\u2019\u2019 United States v. Camacho-Ibarquen, </em>410 F.3d 1307, 1316 n. 3 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 457, 163 L.Ed.2d 347 (2005). As a result, we must follow <em>Almendarez-Torres. See Hohn v. United States, </em>524 U.S. 236, 252-3, 118 S.Ct. 1969, 1978, 141 L.Ed.2d 242 (1998) (\u201cOur decisions remain binding precedent until we see fit to reconsider them, regardless of whether subsequent cases have raised doubt about their continuing validity.\u201d); <em>Camacho-Ibarquen, </em>410 F.3d at 1315 (noting that \u201cthe government need not allege in its indictment and need not prove beyond a reasonable doubt that a defendant -had prior convictions for a district court to use those convictions for purposes of enhancing a sentence\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b932-14\">In <em>United States v. Orduno-Mireles, </em>405 F.3d 960, 962-63 <em>&amp; </em>n. 3 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 223, \u2014 L.Ed.2d -- (2005), we reaffirmed that <em>Shepard </em>does not alter the understanding that \u201cbecause the prior-conviction exception remains undisturbed after <em>Booker, </em>a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"909\">*909</page-number>district court does not err by relying on prior convictions to enhance a defendant\u2019s sentence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b933-5\">This precedent in this Circuit is binding on a panel of this Court and it would be inappropriate for a panel of the Court to certify to the Supreme Court a question that prior panels of the Court have clearly decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-6\">We note that Anthony\u2019s judgment incorrectly states that he \u201cpleaded guilty\u201d to both counts in his indictment. In fact, Anthony was <em>found guilty by a jury </em>of both counts charged in the indictment following a trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-7\">We therefore modify the \u201cJudgment in Criminal Case,\u201d entered by the district court on April 12, 2005, so as to eliminate the following sentence, \u201cThe defendant pleaded guilty to Count(s) 1 and 2 of the Indictment.\u201d The judgment and Anthony\u2019s convictions and sentences are nonetheless affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-8\">AFFIRMED AS MODIFIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
