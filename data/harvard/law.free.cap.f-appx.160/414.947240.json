Hadley appeals the district court\u2019s decision affirming the Commissioner\u2019s denial of social security disability benefits. We affirm for the following reasons:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-11\">1. We agree with the analysis offered in the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation and the district court\u2019s order accepting the magistrate\u2019s recommendation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-12\">2. We further find that the ALJ\u2019s decision comports with the legal standards for disability determination under the Social Security Act and relevant regulations. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520(f).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-13\">3. Hadley argues that the ALJ erred by relying exclusively on the Medical-Vocational Guidelines in finding that he was not under a disability and retains the residual functional capacity for the demands of sedentary work. Use of the Medical-Vocational Guidelines is appropriate when it is established that a claimant suffers only from exertional impairments, or that the claimant\u2019s nonexertional impairments do not significantly affect his residual functional capacity. <em>Loza v. Apfel, </em>219 F.3d 378, 398 (5th Cir.2000). Hadley maintains that his nonexertional limitations keep him from performing the full range of sedentary work. Hadley places strong emphasis on the medical opinion of Dr. Ayer, who concluded that Hadley would be unable to walk, crawl, or exert himself to any significant degree. Dr. Ayer did not define or otherwise explain his diagnosis. By contrast, Dr. Keairnes made a detailed diagnosis that in an eight hour workday, Hadley could stand and/or walk for two hours and sit for six hours with normal breaks. An ALJ is entitled to determine the credibility of medical experts and weigh their opinions accordingly. <em>Greenspan v. Shalala, </em>38 F.3d 232, 237 (5th Cir.1994). In addition to Dr. Keairnes\u2019s relatively more optimistic diagnosis, the ALJ noted Hadley\u2019s clear lungs, high oxygen saturation rates, and the fact that Hadley\u2019s chronic pulmonary disease has been brought under control.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-18\">4. Based on the objective medical data, there is substantial evidence supporting the ALJ\u2019s finding that Hadley has the exertional capacity for sedentary work and does not have non-exertional limitations that would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>significantly limit his ability to perform.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b440-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b439-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the Court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
