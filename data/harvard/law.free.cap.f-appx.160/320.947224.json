Barr seeks to appeal the district court\u2019s order accepting the recommendation of the magistrate judge and denying relief on his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (2000) complaint. We dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction because the notice of appeal was not timely filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-22\">Parties are accorded thirty days after the entry of the district court\u2019s final judgment or order to note an appeal, Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1)(A), unless the district court extends the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(5) or reopens the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(6). This appeal period is \u201cmandatory and jurisdictional.\u201d <em>Browder v. Director, Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>434 U.S. 257, 264, 98 S.Ct. 556, 54 L.Ed.2d 521 (1978) (quoting <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>361 U.S. 220, 229, 80 S.Ct. 282, 4 L.Ed.2d 259 (I960)).</p>\n<p id=\"b344-23\">The district court\u2019s judgment was entered on the docket on May 5, 2005. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>notice of appeal was filed, at the earliest, on June 13, 2005. Because Barr failed to file a timely notice of appeal or to obtain an extension or reopening of the appeal period, we grant the Appellee\u2019s motion to dismiss the appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">\n<em>DISMISSED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
