We have reviewed the record and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm for the reasons stated by the district court. <em>See United States v. Miller, </em>No. CA-04-520-1-JFM (D.Md. Feb. 1, 2005). Because the court has filed and considered Miller\u2019s partial informal brief and his addendum to the informal brief, we deny Miller\u2019s motion to strike the court\u2019s order of September 8, 2005, which denied as moot the motion for extension of time to file Miller\u2019s informal brief. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-23\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
