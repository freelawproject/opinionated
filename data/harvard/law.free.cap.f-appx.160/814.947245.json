First, Defendants contend that Officer Tellez is immune from liability, under Fla. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 768.28(9), because the evidence did not show that Officer Tellez acted with a willful and wanton disregard for Harris\u2019s human rights and safety. Second, Defendants maintain that the district court should have granted judgment in favor of the County because (1) the evidence could not support Harris\u2019s false arrest claim, and (2) Harris\u2019s battery claim is subsumed in the false arrest claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-13\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s ruling on a Fed.R.Civ.P 50 motion for judgment as a matter of law. <em>Telecom Technical Servs. Inc. v. Rolm Co., </em>388 F.3d 820, 831 n. 10 (11th Cir.2004). We draw all inferences in favor of the non-moving party: Harris. <em>Id. </em>And we affirm the jury verdict unless no legal basis exists upon which the jury could have found for Harris. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b839-14\">We initially conclude that Defendants abandoned the argument about Officer Tellez having immunity under Fla. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 768.28(9).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Defense counsel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"816\">*816</page-number>presented this argument in oral Rule 50 motions after the close of Harris\u2019s evidence and after the close of the defense case.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The district court expressed concern over the County and Officer Tellez being represented by one lawyer: defense counsel agreed that if the jury found that Officer Tellez had acted maliciously with a willful disregard for human rights and safety, then the county could not be liable. Defendants\u2019 lawyer indicated that Officer Tellez always was acting within the scope of his employment and that the County should be held responsible if Officer Tellez battered or falsely arrested Harris. Defense counsel then agreed with the district court\u2019s statement that Officer Tellez and the County \u201ceither sink or swim together\u201d: if Officer Tellez was liable for battery and false arrest, then so was the County. And at the charge conference, defense counsel agreed with the court\u2019s decision to strike a proposed instruction that, to impose liability on Officer Tellez, the jury needed to determine that he acted wantonly or with malice. Further, in discussing the proposed verdict form, defense counsel stipulated that, if the jury simply found that Harris proved that Officer Tellez committed battery or false arrest, judgment would be entered against the county. Thus, although Defendants raised the argument that Officer Tellez should escape liability because of Harris\u2019s alleged failure to present evidence that Officer Tellez acted wantonly or with malice, Defendants then abandoned this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-7\">And, drawing all inferences in favor of Harris, we conclude that sufficient evidence supports the jury\u2019s verdict. Under Florida law, a battery consists of \u201cthe infliction of a harmful or offensive contact upon another with the intent to cause such contact or the apprehension that such contact is imminent.\u201d <em>Quilling v. Price, </em>894 So.2d 1061, 1063 (Fla. 5th Dist.Ct.App. 2005). To prove false arrest, a plaintiff must show (1) an unlawful detention and deprivation of liberty against a person\u2019s will that is (2) unreasonable and unwarranted by the circumstances and (3) intentional. <em>Spears v. Albertson\u2019s, Inc., </em>848 So.2d 1176, 1178 (Fla. 1st Dist.Ct.App. 2003). A plaintiff alleging false imprisonment need not show that force was used in the detention. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b840-8\">Here, Harris testified that she had been separated from her husband for several weeks and that her husband attempted to enter their home, accompanied by Officers Tellez and Arana. Harris stated that, when she opened the door, Officer Tellez reached for her, grabbed her around the waist from behind, and that she and Officer Tellez fell to the ground. Harris testified that Officer Tellez remained on top of her while she was face down, told her to be quiet, and told her that she was going to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"817\">*817</page-number>jail. Harris stated that the officers allowed her husband to enter and \u201ctake whatever he wanted.\u201d According to Harris, she then was handcuffed, was taken to a police station, and eventually was taken to jail, where she spent several hours. Harris denied (1) that she pushed either of the officers, (2) that she prevented her husband or the officers from entering the home, and (3) that she became angry and told her husband and the officers to leave.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-5\">The officers presented a different version of the facts. They testified that they responded to a call to help Harris\u2019s husband retrieve some items from his home. They observed him attempt to open the door with a key; after several tries, he pushed open the door and Officer Tellez placed his foot in the door to allow Harris\u2019s husband to enter. The officers testified that they followed Harris\u2019s husband into the house and that Harris then became angry with the officers. According to the officers, Harris yelled at them and eventually pushed Officer Tellez. Officer Tellez stated that he grabbed Harris, took her to the ground, handcuffed her, and arrested her for battery of a police officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-6\">Under the facts that Harris testified about, and drawing all inferences in favor of Harris, sufficient evidence supports the jury\u2019s determination that Officer Tellez committed the torts of battery and false arrest. As the district court opined, this case came down to \u201c[s]he said, he said\u201d; the jury believed Harris\u2019s version of the events.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-7\">And we disagree with Defendants\u2019 argument that the battery claim is \u201csubsumed\u201d <em>in </em>the false arrest claim. Under Harris\u2019s version of the facts, which the jury believed, Officer Tellez battered her without provocation and then committed the separate tort of falsely arresting her. In other words, Harris\u2019s testimony reflects that the battery occurred before the arrest; Defendants thus improperly characterize the battery as the use of force incident to Harris\u2019s arrest.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b841-12\">Defendants also challenge the district court\u2019s exclusion of the arrest affidavit and the offense incident report that Officer Tellez prepared.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Defendants claim that these documents should have been admitted under Fed.R.Evid. 803(6) and (8). Defendants claim that the exclusion of these documents prejudiced them because (1) the documents were necessary to corroborate the officers\u2019 testimony, (2) after excluding the documents, the district court allowed Harris to cross-examine the officers about the contents of these documents, and (3) during its deliberation, the jury asked to see a copy of \u201cthe police report.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b841-13\">We cannot say that the district court abused its discretion by excluding the documents as cumulative, under Fed.R.Evid. 403.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>See Tran v. Toyota Motor Corp., </em>420 F.3d 1310, 1315 (11th Cir.2005) (stating that part of district court\u2019s broad authority over trial management is the power to exclude cumulative testimony).</p>\n<p id=\"b841-14\">Our review of the record shows that the officers testified about their version of the events; and this testimony covers all the information contained in the arrest affidavit and offense report. Further, the dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"818\">*818</page-number>trict court allowed Harris, without introducing the report and affidavit as extrinsic evidence, to impeach the officers by asking them about the facts they testified to on direct examination but had not included in the report and affidavit. In other words, the officers were questioned extensively about the contents of the affidavit and the report: we cannot discern how the district court\u2019s exclusion of the documents themselves constitutes harmful error. <em>See Club Car, Inc. v. Club Car (Quebec) Import, Inc., </em>362 F.3d 775, 781 (11th Cir.2004) (stating that exclusion of cumulative testimony was harmless error).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b842-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b839-10\">. Harris originally filed this action in state court against the County, Officer Tellez, and Officer Jorge Arana. Harris also asserted that Defendants deprived her of her federal constitutional rights under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983; Defendants removed the case to federal district court. At trial, Harris conceded that she had failed to meet her burden of proving all of her federal claims and the state law claims against Officer Arana. The district court entered judgment in favor of Officer Arana on all claims and in favor of Officer Tellez and the County on the federal claims. After the jury\u2019s verdict in favor of Harris, the district court determined liability against Officer Tellez and the County and, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1441(e)(2), remanded the issue of damages to state court. We have jurisdiction over the district court's order. <em>See Quackenbush v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>517 U.S. 706, 116 S.Ct. 1712, 1718-20, 135 L.Ed.2d 1 (1996) (stating that a remand order, not barred from appellate review under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(c) and (d), is appealable as a final order under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, where the order effectively puts the litigants out of federal court and leaves \"nothing of the matter on the federal court's docket\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b839-16\">. This statute provides that employees \"of the state or of any of its subdivisions\u201d may not \"be held personally liable in tort ... for any injury or damage suffered as a result of any act ... in the scope of her or his employment or function, unless such ... employee ... acted in bad faith or with malicious purpose or in a manner exhibiting wanton and willful disregard of human rights, safety, or property.\" Fla. Stat. Ann. 768.28(9)(a). The statute further states that the \"exclusive remedy\u201d for injuries suffered as a result of the act of the employee is \"by action against the governmental entity, ... unless such act or omission was committed in bad faith or with malicious purpose or in a manner exhibiting wanton and willful disregard of human rights, safety, or property.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The statute omits tort liability for the state or its subdivisions for acts of an employee \"committed while acting outside the course and scope of her or his employment or committed in bad faith or with malicious purpose or in a manner exhibiting wan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"816\">*816</page-number>ton and willful disregard of human rights, safety, or property.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b840-5\">. The district court did not expressly deny Defendants\u2019 second Rule 50 motion made at the close of all evidence; instead, the court, without issuing a ruling, allowed the case to go to the jury. Defendants failed to file a post-verdict renewed motion for judgment under Rule 50(b). Some doubt exists about whether Defendants properly preserved their challenges to the sufficiency of the evidence. See <em>Dietz v. Consol. Oil &amp; Gas, Inc., </em>643 F.2d 1088, 1095 (5th Cir. Apr.1981) (stating that, when party moved for directed verdict at close of plaintiff's case and at conclusion of defense, but failed to move for a judgment notwithstanding the verdict, appellate court could not examine evidence for sufficiency); <em>but see </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 50(b) (stating that, if the trial court \"does not grant a motion for judgment as a matter of law made after the close of all the evidence,\u201d then \u201d[t]he movant <em>may </em>renew its request for judgment as a matter of law\u201d after the entry of judgment). But even assuming that Defendants properly preserved their challenges to the sufficiency of the evidence, we reject the merits of these challenges.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b841-8\">. We reject Defendants\u2019 reliance on <em>Jackson v. Sauls, </em>206 F.3d 1156, 1171 (11th Cir.2000), and <em>Lester v. City of Tavares, </em>603 So.2d 18 (Fla. 5th Dist.Ct.App.1992), both of which refer to a battery occurring during the course of an arrest.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b841-9\">. We review evidentiary rulings of the district court for abuse of discretion. <em>Cabello </em>v. <em>Fernandez-Larios, </em>402 F.3d 1148, 1160 (11th Cir. 2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b841-16\">. We thus need not decide whether the district court should have admitted the report and affidavit as exceptions to the rule against hearsay, under Fed.R.Evid. 803(6) and (8).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b842-14\">. About Defendants' attempt to show prejudice based on the jury asking to see a copy of the report during its deliberations, we note that the district court then asked the parties whether it should reopen the case and allow the parties to introduce the report. But defense counsel indicated that, at that point in the proceedings, the court simply should instruct the jury to rely on its recollection of the evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
