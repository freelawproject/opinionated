Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004) , and <em>United States v. Booker, 543 </em>U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005) . We have recently held that the rulings in these cases are not available on collateral review to prisoners whose convictions became final before <em>Booker </em>was decided. <em>See United States v. Morris, </em>429 F.3d 65 (4th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b355-23\">The district court\u2019s order denying relief is not appealable unless a circuit justice or judge issues a certificate of appealability. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1) (2000). A certificate of appealability will not issue absent \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2) (2000). A prisoner satisfies this standard by demonstrating that reasonable jurists would find that the district court\u2019s assessment of his constitutional claims is debatable or wrong and that any dispositive procedural rulings by the district court are also debatable or wrong. <em>See Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 336-38, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003); <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000); <em>Rose v. Lee, 252 </em>F.3d 676, 683-84 (4th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b355-24\">We have granted Shifflett\u2019s motion to file a supplemental brief and have independently reviewed the record, the appeal briefs, and the Fed. R.App. P. 28(j) materials submitted by Shifflett and conclude that Shifflett has not made the requisite showing. Accordingly, we deny Shifflett\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel, deny a certificate of appealability, and dismiss the appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>\n<em>DISMISSED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b355-19\"> Shifflett filed a motion to dismiss his appeal and later filed an objection to dismissal of his appeal. In light of his objection, we deny the motion to dismiss.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
