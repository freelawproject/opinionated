He seeks review of a Board of Immigration Appeals\u2019 (BIA) order denying his applications for asylum and withholding of removal. For the following reasons, the petition is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-19\">The BIA summarily affirmed and adopted the immigration judge\u2019s (IJ) opinion. Therefore, we review the IJ\u2019s factual findings and legal conclusions.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The IJ\u2019s legal conclusions are reviewed <em>de novo.</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The IJ\u2019s factual findings will be upheld if supported by substantial evidence.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Substantial evidence is lacking only if the evidence is \u201c \u2018so compelling that no reasonable factfinder could fail to find\u2019 the petitioner statutorily eligible for relief.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b424-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>The IJ rejected the petitioner\u2019s application for asylum as untimely,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> holding that none of the exceptions to the one-year filing requirement applied.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> It is unclear whether the petitioner seeks review of the IJ\u2019s denial of his application for asylum as untimely. If review is sought, it is barred by explicit statutory language.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We cannot review whether the petitioner\u2019s application for asylum was timely filed or whether an exception to the one-year filing requirement applied.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b424-4\">The IJ also rejected the petitioner\u2019s application for withholding of removal. \u201c[Tjhere is no time bar in seeking withholding of removal.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> To be eligible, an alien must establish a clear probability<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> of persecution on account of the alien\u2019s race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> A clear probability means more likely than not the alien will be persecuted if deported.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The alien\u2019s testimony alone, if credible, is sufficient to sustain the burden.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> However, credibility determinations are the duty of the factfinder, and this court will not substitute its judgment for the IJ\u2019s assessment of a witness\u2019s credibility.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b424-10\">Applying the substantial evidence standard of review, we cannot conclude that the IJ\u2019s. determination was not supported by the record. The petitioner testified that he is a Muslim, as is his family in India, and that his father was injured because of his religion in 1995 and in 1999. But the IJ found the petitioner\u2019s testimony not entirely credible, both because the petitioner\u2019s application for withholding mentioned only the 1999 incident and because the petitioner initially denied seeking refugee status in Canada. No other evidence was provided regarding the alleged incidents, and no explanation was given for the lack of other evidence, such as medical records. In addition, the only evidence that the petitioner\u2019s father was injured on account of his religion was the petitioner\u2019s testimony that his father \u201ctold me\u201d so and that Hindu men lived in the surrounding area. The petitioner testified that he was not present during either of the alleged incidents. This evidence did not compel a finding of past persecution or more-likely-than-not future persecution.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b424-11\">With regard to persecution of other Muslims in India, besides the petitioner\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>family, the record does not compel the conclusion that there is \u201ca pattern or practice of persecution\u201d of Muslims such that \u201cmore likely than not\u201d the petitioner\u2019s \u201clife or freedom would be threatened\u201d upon return to India.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The record contains evidence of much violence against Muslims in India, particularly in Gujarat in 2002. In Gujarat alone, horrific events led to the deaths of an estimated 850 to 2000 Muslims. But according to other evidence in the record, \u201c[d]espite the[se] incidents of violence and discrimination ..., relations between various religious groups generally are amicable among the substantial majority of citizens.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Applying the substantial evidence standard of review, we conclude that this latter evidence supports the IJ\u2019s decision to deny the petitioner\u2019s application for withholding of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">For these reasons, the petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b423-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
