Verduzco-Contreras contends the IJ: improperly admitted in evidence a Form 1-9 seized in an illegal search; committed legal error in finding petitioner\u2019s false claim to being a United States national was equivalent to a false claim of United States citizenship, rendering him ineligible for adjustment status or voluntary departure; erred in finding petitioner lacked good moral character; and erred in denying a continuance for adjudication of Petitioner\u2019s 1-130 Petition for Alien Relative. Verduzco-Contreras also claims the BIA erred in affirming the I J\u2019s order without opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-20\">Verduzco-Contreras entered the United States without inspection in 1989. The former Immigration and Naturalization Service brought removal proceedings against Verduzco-Contreras beginning in 2001. On 27 March 2001, at his first ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>pearance before the IJ, Verduzco-Contreras admitted he: (1) is a native of Mexico; (2) is not a citizen or national of the United States; (3) entered the United States on or about 1989; and (4) was not then admitted or paroled after inspection by an Immigration officer. Pursuant to these admissions, Verduzco-Contreras conceded removability. He subsequently applied for adjustment of status.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-4\">On 24 February 2003, the INS entered an additional charge against VerduzcoContreras: that he falsely \u201crepresented [himself] to be a citizen of the United States on a Form 1-9 for the purpose of obtaining employment in the United States\u201d, in violation of \u00a7 212(a)(6)(C)(ii) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA); and that, to support his false claim of citizenship, he submitted a driver\u2019s license issued by the State of Texas and a Social Security card. At a hearing before the IJ on 18 July 2003, Verduzco-Contreras admitted these allegations.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">Pursuant to this admission, the IJ entered an order of removal and denied petitioner\u2019s request for voluntary departure. Additionally, the IJ denied VerduzcoContreras\u2019 request for adjustment of status because his application was incomplete. Verduzco-Contreras appealed to the BIA, which affirmed without opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">Although this court generally reviews BIA, not IJ, decisions, we may review an IJ\u2019s decision when, as here, the BIA affirms without opinion. <em>Thuri v. Ashcroft, </em>380 F.3d 788, 791 (5th Cir.2004). We have exclusive jurisdiction to review a final order of removal, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(1), with review being limited to the administrative record, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 1252(b)(4)(A). \u201c[Administrative findings of fact are conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary\u201d. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B). And, \u201ca decision that an alien is not eligible for admission to the United States is conclusive unless manifestly contrary to law\u201d. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1252(b)(4)(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b432-8\">Verduzco-Contreras claims the IJ erred in ordering his removal based on an improperly admitted Form 1-9. He does not contest, however, he conceded: at the March 2001 hearing, that he is subject to removal because he entered the United States without inspection; and, at the July 2003 hearing, that he falsely claimed to be a United States citizen to gain employment. These concessions are judicial admissions upon which the IJ was entitled to rely. <em>Martinez v. Bally\u2019s La., Inc., </em>244 F.3d 474, 476 (5th Cir.2001)(holding \u201c[a] judicial admission is a formal concession in the pleadings or stipulations by a party or counsel that is binding on the party making them\u201d). Additionally, VerduzcoContreras has not shown he objected at the hearing to the IJ\u2019s decision to admit the Form 1-9. Absent any such objection, the IJ was well within his discretion to accept the document. <em>See United States v. L.A. Tucker Truck Lines, Inc., </em>344 U.S. 33, 37, 73 S.Ct. 67, 97 L.Ed. 54 (1952). Furthermore, absent Petitioner\u2019s showing \u201cegregious violations of [the] Fourth Amendment\u201d, we decline to consider his contention the Form 1-9 was admitted as the fruit of an illegal search. <em>Gonzalez-Rivera v. I.N.S., </em>22 F.3d 1441, 1448 (9th Cir.1994) (internal quotation omitted). \u201cIt is well-established that the Fourth Amendment exclusionary rule is not to be applied in deportation proceedings.\u201d <em>Mendoza-Solis v. I.N.S., </em>36 F.3d 12, 14 (5th Cir.l994)(citing <em>I.N.S. v. Lopez-Mendoza, </em>468 U.S. 1032, 1050-51, 104 S.Ct. 3479, 82 L.Ed.2d 778 (1984)). For these reasons, the IJ\u2019s order of removal was not \u201cmanifestly contrary to law\u201d. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b432-9\">Next, Verduzco-Contreras claims: at the July 2003 hearing, the IJ improperly denied a motion for continuance for his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>application for status adjustment. Petitioner contends he is eligible to adjust his status to a lawful permanent resident because he is the spouse of a United States citizen. The Government, on the other hand, claims Petitioner never made such a motion. Petitioner does <em>not </em>respond to this point in his reply brief. Moreover, he does <em>not </em>cite the relevant part of the record. Concomitantly, based on our review, we do not find the motion. Therefore, we decline to consider this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">Verduzco-Contreras contends the IJ erred in finding Verduzco-Contreras lacked good moral character. This finding related solely to the I J\u2019s denial of Petitioner\u2019s request for voluntary departure, and <em>not </em>his request for status adjustment. This court does not have jurisdiction to review a denial for voluntary departure. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229c\u00ae.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">Lastly, Verduzco-Contreras claims the BIA erred in affirming the IJ without opinion because the streamlining regulations were not applicable. VerduzcoContreras claims erroneously that the legal issues in dispute are not guided by clear precedent. Judicial admissions are binding on the party who makes them. <em>Martinez, </em>244 at 476. This principle is so well settled that a three-Member review is not warranted. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(e)(6)(iii).</p>\n<p id=\"b433-8\">\n<em>DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b431-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
