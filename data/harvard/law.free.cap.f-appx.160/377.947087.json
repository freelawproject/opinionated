Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-19\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b402-20\">In July 2001, the Natchez-Adams School District (\u201cNASD\u201d) posted notice of a job opportunity for the position of elementary school principal at McLaurin Elementary School. Eleven persons, including Todd, applied for the job. Each applicant met certain threshold qualifications, and each was interviewed by an eight-person hiring committee. The committee members asked each applicant the same questions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>and ranked their responses on standardized forms. The committee members were instructed not to ask questions based on impermissible factors, including race, gender, or age. NASD Superintendent Dr. Carl Davis, in accordance with past practice, accepted the committee\u2019s recommendation and hired the person with the highest score following the interview process, Allison Lack.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">After filing a claim with the EEOC, Todd initiated the present lawsuit, contending that NASD failed to hire her for the position of McLaurin Elementary Principal on the basis of her race, age, and gender.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Todd, a 57-year old African American female, claimed that the hiring of Lack, a young white female, evidences that NASD impermissibly discriminated against her on account of her race and age. NASD responds that Todd was not hired because she did not perform well in front of the interview committee and was not the best candidate for the position. The district court granted summary judgment to NASD, finding that Todd failed to present any evidence of intentional discrimination. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">\n<em>II</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b403-7\">We review the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>applying the same standard as the district court.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We apply the burden-shifting framework provided by the Supreme Court in <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. </em>Green<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> to Todd\u2019s claims of racial discrimination and age discrimination.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Under <em>McDonnell Douglas, </em>after the plaintiff makes a prima facie case of discrimination,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the employer must identify a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for its action that supports a finding that unlawful discrimination did not cause the employment action.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The district court found that NASD provided a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for not hiring Todd \u2014 specifically, that she did not perform well in her interview. Todd contends that the reason must be stated with \u201csufficient clarity\u201d to afford the employee a realistic opportunity to show that the reason is pretextual.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b403-13\">We agree with the district court that NASD\u2019s proffered reason for not hiring Todd was sufficiently clear. NASD asserted that Todd was not hired because she did not perform well in her interview, and the evidence submitted in connection with NASD\u2019s motion for summary judgment supports that finding. As the district court found, \u201cMany of the interviewers stated that they felt Todd did not address questions precisely and did not provide much detail regarding the plans she would implement if she were selected for the position.\u201d Moreover, the evaluation sheets submitted by the interviewers indicated that Todd\u2019s responses were \u201ctoo lengthy\u201d and that she \u201cseem[ed] to ramble a bit.\u201d We find no error in the district court\u2019s analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-14\">Next, Todd argues that NASD ignored all objective qualifications and re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>lied, instead, on a subjective interview process to fill the Principal position at McLaurin Elementary. We disagree. We have held that \u201c[t]he mere fact that an employer uses subjective criteria is not sufficient evidence of pretext.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Here, there is no evidence that the interview process was used as a mask for discrimination.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> As the Eleventh Circuit has noted, \u201cAn interview is frequently necessary to assess qualities that are particular important in supervisory or professional positions ... because traits such as common sense, good judgment, originality, ambition, loyalty and tact often must be assessed primarily in subjective fashion.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We think this principal is especially appropriate when a school district is hiring the Principal of an elementary school. We find no error in the district court\u2019s analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\">\n<em>Ill</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b402-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
