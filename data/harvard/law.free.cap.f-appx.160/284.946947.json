Accordingly, we affirm for the reasons stated by the district court. <em>See United States v. Wyatt, </em>No. CR-01-330 (E.D. Va. June 9, 2005). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-22\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b308-20\"> Wyatt's July 5, 2005 notice of appeal was not filed within ten days of the May 10, 2005 denial of his \u00a7 3582 motion, so we do not have jurisdiction to review that order. <em>See United States v. Alvarez, </em>210 F.3d 309, 310 (5th Cir.2000). To the extent Wyatt seeks to appeal the district court\u2019s April 9, 2005 denial of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2000) motion, his notice of appeal was untimely, so we have no jurisdiction to review that order. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
