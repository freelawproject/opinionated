After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-9\">On appeal, Tynes argues that, even under an advisory guidelines system, his sentence: (1) violates the statutory maximum as defined by <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000); (2) violates <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), because the district court determined drug quantity based on facts neither admitted by him nor proven beyond a reasonable doubt; and (3) was unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-10\">I. STATUTORY MAXIMUM</p>\n<p id=\"b963-11\">Tynes argues that his sentence violates <em>Apprendi </em>because the district court impermissibly held him accountable for 1,360 kilograms of marijuana. Specifically, Tynes asserts that because (1) he did not admit to the 1,360 kilograms, and (2) the jury specifically found him guilty of distributing less than 1,000 kilograms of cocaine, the statutory maximum for <em>Apprendi </em>purposes is limited to a drug quantity of less than 1,000 kilograms.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-14\">Tynes was originally charged with conspiring to possess with intent to distribute 1000 kilograms or more of a mixture or substance containing marijuana, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1), (b)(l)(B)(vii) and 846 (Count I). Although the jury returned a guilty verdict as to Count I, the district court submitted a special verdict that directed the jury to \u201cdetermine the amount of marijuana involved in the conspiracy.\u201d The jury selected \u201cless than one thousand (1,000) kilograms but one hundred (100) kilograms or more of ... marijuana.\u201d Thus, under <em>Apprendi, </em>the statutory maximum is limited to the maximum for an amount less than 1,000 kilograms of marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-15\">Based on the drug quantity found by the jury (less than 1,000 kilograms but more than 100 kilograms of marijuana), Tynes\u2019s statutory maximum would have been 40 years. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. 841(b)(1)(B). However, because Tynes has a prior criminal conviction for a felony drug offense, his statutory maximum became life. <em>See id.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Because Tynes\u2019s statutory maximum was life, his 324-month sentence did not violate <em>Apprendi.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b963-16\">II. <em>BOOKER</em></p>\n<p id=\"b963-17\">Tynes also argues that his sentence violates <em>Booker </em>because the district court de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"940\">*940</page-number>termined drug quantity based on facts neither admitted by him nor proven beyond a reasonable doubt. This argument is foreclosed by Tynes\u2019s first appeal.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b964-4\">In any event, this Court has. repeatedly stated that after <em>Booker </em>a district court may continue to determine drug quantity, or any other enhancement under an advisory guidelines system, based on a preponderance of the evidence. <em>See United States v. Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d 1291, 1297 (11th Cir.2005). In fact, a district court may even continue to consider relevant <em>acquitted </em>conduct when applying the guidelines in an advisory manner. <em>See United States v. Duncan, </em>400 F.3d 1297, 1304-05 (11th Cir.2005). Consequently, Tynes\u2019s <em>Booker </em>argument is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-5\">III. REASONABLENESS</p>\n<p id=\"b964-6\">Finally, Tynes argues that his sentences were unreasonable because his co-defendants received lower sentences. However, Tynes acknowledges that his \u201cprior criminal history likely resulted in a stiffer penalty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b964-7\">In imposing Tynes\u2019s sentences, the district court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b964-8\">I do find this sentence meets the general goals of punishment and hopefully will act as a deterrence [sic] to others who might consider similar criminal conduct. And upon review of all of the factors properly considered under Title 18, United States Code, Section 3553-[a], taking into account the advisory nature of the sentencing guidelines, I do con-elude that this sentence, which is within the guideline range but at the low end, is reasonable. This sentence is sufficient and a greater sentence is not necessary to comply with the statutory and defined purposes of sentencing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b964-11\">Given Tynes\u2019s criminal history and the district court\u2019s consideration of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, we conclude that his sentence was not unreasonable. <em>See United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324, 1330 (11th Cir.2005); <em>United States v. Winingear, </em>422 F.3d 1241, 1246 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b964-12\">For all the above reasons, we affirm Tynes\u2019s concurrent 324-month and 120-month sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b963-12\">. \"In <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), the Supreme Court held that the government need not allege in its indictment and need not prove beyond a reasonable doubt that a defendant had prior convictions for a district court to use those convictions for purposes of enhancing a sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Marseille, </em>377 F.3d 1249, 1257 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>543 U.S. 1013, 125 S.Ct. 637, 160 L.Ed.2d 480 (2004). Neither <em>Apprendi, Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), nor <em>Booker </em>disturbed the <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>holding. <em>United States v. Camacho-Iharquen, </em>410 F.3d 1307, 1315-16 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b964-9\">. This is Tynes's second appeal before this Court. In his first appeal, this Court determined that there was sufficient evidence to support the application of various enhancements and that the defendant's sentence did not violate <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), or <em>Blakely v. Washington, 542 U.S. 296, 124 </em>S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004). <em>See United States v. Tynes, </em>127 Fed.Appx. 472 (11th Cir.2004). Shortly thereafter, the Supreme Court decided <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). Based on <em>Boolcer, </em>this Court granted Tynes's motion for reconsideration and vacated his sentence. <em>See United States v. Tynes, </em>133 Fed.Appx. 739 (11th Cir.2005). However, this Court affirmed the district court\u2019s guidelines calculations, including drug quantity. <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
