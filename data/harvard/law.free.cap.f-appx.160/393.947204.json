Nix (Nix) applied to the Social Security Administration for disability insurance benefits under Title II of the Social Security Act, alleging disability due to arthritis, bad eyesight, and high blood pressure. Nix\u2019s application was denied on initial determination and on reconsideration. Nix then requested and received a hearing before an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ). The ALJ determined that Nix was not disabled within the meaning of the Social Security Act at any time on or before September 30, 1999, the date his disability insured status<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> expired. The Appeals Council of the Social Security Administration remanded the case to the ALJ for clarification of Nix\u2019s residual functional capacity. After a supplemental hearing, the ALJ again determined that Nix was not disabled at any time through September 30, 1999. Upon the Appeals Council\u2019s denial of Nix\u2019s request for review, the ALJ\u2019s decision became the final administrative decision of the Commissioner of Social Security (Commissioner).</p>\n<p id=\"b418-14\">Nix filed suit in district court seeking review of the final administrative decision denying her disability claim.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> A federal magistrate judge recommended that the district court affirm the Commissioner\u2019s decision and dismiss Nix\u2019s complaint with prejudice. The district judge adopted the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation over Nix\u2019s objections, and affirmed the Commissioner\u2019s decision. Nix appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-15\">We review the Commissioner\u2019s decision to deny benefits to determine whether that decision is supported by substantial evidence and whether the proper legal standards were applied.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-16\">Substantial evidence is such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept to support a conclusion. It is more than a mere scintilla and less than a preponderance. A finding of no substantial evidence is appropriate only if no credible evidentiary choices or medical findings support the decision. In applying this standard, we may not reweigh the evidence or substitute our judgment for that of the Commissioner. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>This court must affirm the Commissioner\u2019s determination unless this court finds that 1) the ALJ applied an incorrect legal standard, or 2) that the ALJ\u2019s determination is not supported by substantial evidence.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">Nix argues that the ALJ erred in failing to properly 1) assess the opinions of his treating physicians; 2) evaluate his allegations of disabling pain; and 3) establish an onset date of disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">To qualify for disability insurance benefits, Nix must have met the definition of disability set forth in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 423 on or before his disability insured status expired. Disability is defined as the \u201cinability to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment which can be expected to result in death or which has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than 12 months.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> A five-step inquiry set forth at 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520 determines whether a claimant meets this definition: 1) whether the claimant is doing substantial gainful activity; 2) whether the claimant has a severe impairment that significantly limits the physical or mental ability to perform basic work activities; 3) whether the claimant\u2019s impairment meets or equals an impairment listed in the appendix to the regulations; 4) whether the impairment prevents a claimant from performing past relevant work; and 5) whether the impairment prevents the claimant from doing other types of work. In this case, the ALJ determined that Nix was not disabled at the fifth step because he could perform light work.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> For the reasons that follow, we affirm the decision to deny Nix\u2019s application for disability insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-11\">The ALJ did not err in his assessment of the medical opinions of Dr. J.W. Chat-well and Dr. Enrique Rodriguez. On April 17, 2000 (approximately six months after Nix\u2019s disability insured status expired), Dr. Chatwell determined that Nix could not perform any standing or walking in the course of an eight-hour work day, could occasionally lift up to 20 pounds, and could never perform postural activities such as bending, kneeling, crouching, and stooping. On August 12, 2002 (approximately two years after Nix\u2019s disability insured status expired), Dr. Rodriguez determined that Nix could stand or walk for two hours of an eight-hour work day, could occasionally lift or carry up to ten pounds, and could never perform postural activities such as bending, stooping, and crouching, but could occasionally kneel. In their assessments, neither Dr. Chatwell nor Dr. Rodriguez indicated that their opinions were intended to describe Nix\u2019s condition before his disability insured status expired on September 30,1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-12\">\u201cA treating source\u2019s medical opinion on what an individual can still do despite his or her impairment(s) will not be entitled to controlling weight if substantial, nonmedical evidence shows that the individual\u2019s activities are greater than those provided in the treating source\u2019s opinion.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>\u201c[T]he ALJ is free to reject the opinion of any physician when the evidence supports a contrary conclusion.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The record reveals that on November 26, 1999 (approximately two months after Nix\u2019s disability insured status expired), Nix sought treatment for a possible hernia because \u201c[h]e lifted a lawn mower a few days ago and developed pain in the lower abdomen.\u201d Nix did not, however, complain at that time of any other aches or pains. The record also reflects that on February 15, 2000 (approximately four months after Nix\u2019s disability insured status expired), Nix sought treatment after \u201cload[ing] some cross-ties and crossbars.\u201d Nix testified that the crossties weighed between fifty and sixty pounds. Finally, a treatment record dated May 1, 2000 reported that Nix \u201cis not working, but he and his wife are remodeling a house and [he is] apparently on his feet a lot.\u201d Because Nix\u2019s actual activities were greater than those provided in his treating physicians\u2019 opinions, the ALJ did not err in refusing to give the opinions controlling or significant weight.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b420-4\">The ALJ applied the correct legal standards for evaluating Nix\u2019s alleged pain. Pain can constitute a disabling impairment.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> \u201cWhether pain is disabling is an issue for the ALJ, who has the primary responsibility for resolving conflicts in the evidence.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Pain is disabling when it is \u201cconstant, unremitting, and wholly unresponsive to therapeutic treatment.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> \u201c[T]he law requires the ALJ to make affirmative findings regarding a claimant\u2019s subjective complaints.\u201d <footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The ALJ fulfilled his obligation by expressly rejecting Nix\u2019s contention that his subjective pain was of a disabling nature. The ALJ stated, \u201c[Nix\u2019s] complaints suggest a far greater degree of impairment than is established by the objective medical evidence alone for the period November 15, 1996 through September 30, 1999. Further, there are significant inconsistencies between his subjective complaints and the objective medical evidence.\u201d The ALJ then identified the inconsistencies and concluded that, \u201c[Nix] exaggerated both the nature and the severity of his subjective complaints to the extent that he has alleged total disability prior to [September 30, 1999].\u201d There is substantial evidence in the record supporting the ALJ\u2019s determination that Nix\u2019s pain was not disabling.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-13\">The ALJ did not fail to properly establish an onset date of disability. Social Security Ruling 83-20 (S.S.R.83-20) provides the framework by which an ALJ is to determine the onset date of disability. Nix argues that the ALJ erred by inferring an onset date later than September 30, 1999, without the use of a medical advisor. Under S.S.R. 83-20, the disability onset date is \u201cthe first day an individual is disabled as defined in the Act and the regulations.\u201d In this case, the ALJ determined that Nix was not disabled. Because the ALJ did not find that Nix was dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>abled, no inquiry into an onset date was required.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b418-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
