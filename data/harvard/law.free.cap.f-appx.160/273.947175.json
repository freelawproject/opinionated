Because Fulp may cure the defect in his complaint by filing a supplemental complaint in accordance with the district court\u2019s order, the dismissal is not appealable. <em>See Domino Sugar Corp. v. Sugar Workers Local Union 392, </em>10 F.3d 1064, 1066-67 (4th Cir.1993). Accordingly, we dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction. We further deny Fulp\u2019s motion to amend caption. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-23\">\n<em>DISMISSED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
