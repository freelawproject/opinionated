He also argues that the district court reversibly erred when it sentenced him pursuant to the mandatory Guidelines scheme that was stricken in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b444-7\">While the record indicates that a document was provided to the district court to support the probation department\u2019s characterization of Rubio-Garcia\u2019s prior DUI offense as a felony that warranted the U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b(l)(D) enhancement, the document is not in the record. Thus, this court cannot review the document to resolve whether the district court erred when it relied upon the document for the enhancement. <em>See Shepard v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-,-, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 1257, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005); <em>United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 273-74 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 298, - L.Ed.2d - (2005) (citation omitted). Because the document is missing from this court\u2019s record, the only support for the enhancement is the assertions that are set forth in the presentence report. For enhancement purposes, a district court may not rely solely on the PSR\u2019s characterization of the offense. <em>See Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d at 274. Additionally, the probation department described the document that was allegedly provided to the district court as a computer printout. A \u201ccomputer printout\u201d is not a charging document, a written plea agreement, a transcript of plea colloquy, or a explicit factual finding by the trial judge to which the defendant assented. Therefore, based upon the probation department\u2019s description of the document and the authority set forth in <em>Shepard, </em>125 S.Ct. at 1257, and <em>Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d at 274, the district court erred when it determined that Ru-bio-Garcia\u2019s prior DUI conviction warranted the U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2((b)(l)(D) enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-17\">Because this court is vacating RubioGarcia\u2019s sentence due to a misapplication of the Guidelines, it is not necessary to address Rubio-Garcia\u2019s <em>Booker </em>claim. <em>See Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d at 275 n. 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-18\">We therefore VACATE Rubio-Garcia\u2019s sentence and REMAND for resentencing consistent with this opinion and the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Booker.</em></p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b444-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
