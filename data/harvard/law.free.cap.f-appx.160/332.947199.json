Although Bailey sought, and received, transfer of his \u00a7 2241 petition from the Eastern District of Kentucky, his place of confinement, to the Eastern District of Virginia, the sentencing court, it is clear that Bailey intended to file a \u00a7 2241 petition raising a claim under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). Bailey argues on appeal that \u00a7 2255 is inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention, contending that his <em>Booker </em>claim should be considered in the context of his \u00a7 2241 petition. Judicial review of a \u00a7 2241 petition must be sought in the the district of confinement rather than the sentencing court. <em>In re Jones, </em>226 F.3d 328, 333 (4th Cir.2000). In cases such as this one, where relief is sought in the sentencing court, the court is without jurisdiction to consider the request. On this basis, we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of Bailey\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition without prejudice for lack of jurisdiction. We deny Bailey\u2019s motion for expedited response as moot. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-12\">\n<em>AFFIRMED AS MODIFIED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
