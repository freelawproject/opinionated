The sole issue on appeal is whether the evidence submitted at trial was sufficient to establish his knowing possession of a firearm. After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-27\">We usually review the sufficiency of the evidence to support a conviction <em>de novo, </em>resolving all reasonable inferences from the evidence in favor of the jury\u2019s verdict. <em>See United States v. Rudisill, </em>187 F.3d 1260, 1267 (11th Cir.1999). However, because Gomez did not challenge the sufficiency of the evidence in the district court, by moving for a judgment of acquittal at the close of the evidence, we would reverse on the basis of insufficiency of the evidence \u201c \u2018only to prevent a manifest miscarriage of justice.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Burston, </em>159 F.3d 1328, 1332 n. 5 (11th Cir.1998) (quoting <em>United States v. Hamblin, </em>911 F.2d 551, 556-57 (11th Cir.1990)).</p>\n<p id=\"b922-28\">To establish a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1), the government must establish: (1) that the defendant was a convicted felon; (2) that the defendant knew he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"899\">*899</page-number>was in possession of a firearm; and (8) that the firearm affected or was in interstate commerce. <em>See United States v. Wright, </em>392 F.3d 1269, 1273 (11th Cir. 2004), <em>cert. denied </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 125 S.Ct. 1751, 161 L.Ed.2d 615 (2005). Gomez challenges the government\u2019s evidence on only the second element, arguing that he did not knowingly possess the firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-7\">\u201cPossession can be shown by circumstantial as well as direct evidence ... [and] ... can be either actual or constructive[.]\u201d <em>United States v. Crawford, </em>906 F.2d 1531, 1535 (11th Cir.1990). \u201cA defendant has constructive possession if he exercises ownership, dominion, or control over the firearm. A defendant also has constructive possession if he has the power and intention to exercise dominion or control.\u201d <em>United States v. Gunn, </em>369 F.3d 1229, 1235 (11th Cir.) (citations omitted), <em>cert. denied </em>543 U.S. 937, 125 S.Ct. 324, 160 L.Ed.2d 244 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b923-8\">At trial, four police detectives unequivocally testified that a firearm was found on the seat of the vehicle that Gomez was driving (and in which he was the lone occupant), and that, when he was asked if he had any <em>other </em>weapons, he responded \u201cno.\u201d The government presented photographic evidence supporting the officers\u2019 testimony that the weapon was not only on the driver\u2019s seat but was located in such a way that Gomez was sitting on, or was in direct physical contact with, the firearm when he was stopped. Simply put, the evidence amply demonstrated the presence of a firearm, on the driver\u2019s seat of the vehicle that Gomez was driving, and we cannot say that his conviction is based on a manifest injustice. Accordingly, we affirm his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
