In his complaint, Seaff-Martinez sought injunctive relief and money damages based on the BOP\u2019s alleged failure to (1) maintain accurate records, (2) expunge false information from Scaff-Martinez\u2019s prison file, and (3) amend an alleged inaccuracy in his file. The district court dismissed the complaint, finding that the BOP was exempt from the provisions of the Privacy Act upon which Seaff-Martinez based his claims. On appeal, Seaff-Martinez argues that the district court\u2019s dismissal was erroneous because BOP officials acted intentionally and willfully in failing to maintain accurate records, which resulted in an adverse determination in his file and a transfer to a higher-security facility. He also asserts that his due process rights were violated by BOP officials and the district court.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After careful review of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-10\">Although the district court dismissed Scaff-Martinez\u2019s claim pursuant to Fed. R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6), because matters outside the pleadings were presented to and not excluded by the court, the dismissal is better characterized as a grant of summary judgment in favor of the BOP. We review the district court\u2019s grant of a motion for summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>\u201capplying the same legal standards that bound the district court.\u201d <em>Jackson v. Bell-South Telecomm,., </em>372 F.3d 1250, 1279 (11th Cir.2004). Summary judgment is appropriate when \u201cthe pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c). A material fact is genuine only \u201cif the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party.\u201d <em>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., </em>477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 2510, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b980-11\">First, Seaff-Martinez asserts that he can maintain an action under the Privacy Act where the BOP acted intentionally and wilfully in failing to maintain his records, resulting in an adverse determination. We disagree. Quite simply, pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"957\">*957</page-number>suant to 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 16.97, the Inmate Central Record System has been exempted from the provisions of the Privacy Act under which Scaff-Martinez filed his claims. <em>See </em>28 C.F.R. \u00a7 16.97(a), (b)(8), (j), and (k)(2) (2005). More specifically, inmate records are exempt, pursuant to 28 C.F.R \u00a7 16.97(a) and (j), from 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a(d), (e)(5), and (g). As result of this exemption, Scaff-Martinez has no cause of action upon which relief can be granted and, therefore, he has no claim for money damages. Accordingly, the district court did not err on this basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-5\">We likewise are unconvinced by Scaff-Martinez\u2019s argument that his due process rights were violated by BOP officials. The Supreme Court established a cause of action for monetary damages and injunctive relief against federal officials in their individual capacities for a violation of a federal constitutional right in <em>Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of Fed. Bureau of Narcotics, </em>403 U.S. 388, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971). However, the Supreme Court has held that federal agencies cannot be sued for damages arising from an agency\u2019s alleged violation of a plaintiff\u2019s constitutional rights. <em>See F.D.I.C. v. Meyer, </em>510 U.S. 471, 486, 114 S.Ct. 996, 1005-06, 127 L.Ed.2d 308 (1994). The Supreme Court reasoned that if it permitted Bivens-type actions against federal agencies it would undermine the rationale of <em>Bivens </em>and create a potentially enormous financial burden for the federal government. <em>Id. </em>As a result, <em>Bivens </em>claims are \u201conly cognizable when brought against federal officials individually.\u201d <em>United States v. 1461 West 42nd Street, Hialeah, Fla., </em>251 F.3d 1329, 1339-40 (11th Cir.2001). Thus, Scaff-Martinez cannot maintain an independent constitutional cause of action against the BOP because it is a federal agency and, therefore, is immune from <em>Bivens </em>actions. <em>See Meyer, </em>510 U.S. at 486, 114 S.Ct. at 1005-06.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b981-8\">Finally, Seaff-Martinez\u2019s argument that the district court violated his due process rights by not striking an unsworn declaration for its alleged failure to comply with Rule 56(e) is without merit. Rule 56(e) states in pertinent part that \u201c[s]up-porting and opposing affidavits shall be made on personal knowledge, shall set forth such facts as would be admissible in evidence, and shall show affirmatively that the affiant is competent to testify to the matters stated therein____\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(e). Under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1746(2), any rule that requires an affidavit, such as Rule 56(e), can be satisfied by an unsworn declaration as long as it was made under the penalty of perjury. Because the unsworn declaration was made under the penalty of perjury, there was no Rule 56(e) violation. Therefore, the district court\u2019s refusal to strike the unsworn declaration was not erroneous and certainly did not constitute a due process violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-11\">In sum, the district court did not err by dismissing Scaff-Martinez\u2019s Privacy Act claims and, accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b980-8\">. We reject Scaff-Martinez's additional argument that the district court\u2019s application of an amended version of the Privacy Act violated the Ex Post Facto Clause. There was no <em>ex post facto </em>violation here because the amended provision at issue \u2014 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 16.97 \u2014 does not impose punishment and is a regulation, rather than a statute. <em>Cf. Collins v. Young-blood, </em>497 U.S. 37, 41, 110 S.Ct. 2715, 2718, 111 L.Ed.2d 30 (1990) (holding that \"the constitutional prohibition on <em>ex post facto </em>laws applies only to penal statutes which disadvantage the offender affected by them\u201d); <em>Conlogue v. Shinbaum, </em>949 F.2d 378, 381 (11th Cir.1991) (stating that \u201ca law violates the <em>ex post facto </em>clause if it is penal or criminal, and imposes a punishment for an act which was not punishable at the time it was committed; or imposes additional punishment to that then prescribed\u201d). In support of his <em>ex post facto </em>argument, Seaff-Martinez relies on our recent decision in <em>Cabello v. Fernandez-Larios, </em>402 F.3d 1148 (11th Cir.2005). That case is distinguishable because it involved a statute, whereas the instant case concerns a regulation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b981-6\">. As for Scaff-Martinez\u2019s arguments concerning the Warden and other BOP officials, his argument is without merit because the BOP was the only defendant named in the complaint. <em>See 1461 West 42nd. Street, </em>251 F.3d at 1339-40.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
