His careful consideration of the matter resulted in an elaborate memorandum, five typewritten pages in length, in which the law and the facts are most carefully and correctly analyzed, pursuant to which the appellant was found to be entitled to no relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-19\">Our review of the case leads to complete agreement with the findings and judgment below, 247 F.Supp. 435, and an extended opinion here could not add anything of value to what has already been said.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-20\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
