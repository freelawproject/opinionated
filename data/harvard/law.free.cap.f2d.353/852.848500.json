Reversing the Trial Examiner, a panel<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> of the Board, by a divided vote, entered its Decision and Order of September 28, 1964, dismissing the complaint.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Union's motion for reconsideration or rehearing was denied by order of March 25, 1965, reaffirming the original decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"853\">*853</page-number>In the latter part of July 1963, the Union\u2019s area representative, McPherson, commenced organizational activity at a road construction job for which the Employer had been awarded a contract by the North Dakota Highway Department. The Employer\u2019s president, Mr. Struksnes, was away much of the time attending to other highway projects.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-4\">The record did not show when Struksnes was expected to return to Minot, but it is clear that McPherson on August 7, 1963 consulted the Employer\u2019s attorney, Van Sickle, and asked him to arrange a meeting with Struksnes. There was no evidence that Van Sickle then had authority to commit the Employer to any particular course, or to speak for the Employer in terms of possible doubt as to the status of the Union membership. McPherson testified that he \u201cfelt\u201d he \u201chad the majority of the people and felt that we should sit down and talk about a contract.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Under date of August 9, 1963, Van Sickle wrote to McPherson:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b903-5\">\u201cDear Bob:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b903-6\">Re: Our File No. 5034 \u2014 Struksnes Construction, Inc.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b903-7\">\u201cIn preparation to discuss your labor agreement with Christ Struksnes, I wonder if you would tell me the number of employees Christ Struksnes has, who are members of your Union as of a specific date, (I would suggest, for instance, this last pay day, or any other pay day), so that when I talk the matter over with Christ I can show him the representation.\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b903-10\">McPherson under date of August 12, 1963 responded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b903-11\">\u201cDear Bruce:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b903-12\">RE: Your File #5034 \u2014 Struksnes Construction Inc. ,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b903-13\">\u201cIn checking over my lists, I find that as of last Friday, August 9, I represent 20 men on Struksnes\u2019 job. If there is anything else that you need, please let me know. If it is possible, I would like a meeting set up at your and Christ\u2019s earliest convenience.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b903-15\">[Sgd.j \u201cBob McPherson\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b903-16\">The record is silent as to details of developments following the \u201cBruce\u201d and \u201cBob\u201d correspondence until as of August 16, 1963, Van Sickle wrote to \u201cDear Bob\u201d that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b903-17\">\u201cChrist Struksnes has now informed me that a majority of his men have advised him that they do not want him to negotiate with you <em>with reference to a contract. </em>I feel that I should advise you of this immediately * * * \u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b903-18\">It thus would seem that at least as of August 16th, and probably earlier, Struksnes had returned and had conferred with Van Sickle. We may assume that the latter must have informed Struksnes of the contents of McPherson\u2019s letter of August 12. Also, we do not doubt that by the 16th, Van Sickle definitely represented the Employer, and thus felt impelled \u201cin good faith\u201d to apprise McPherson that a majority of the men in the appropriate unit did not want Struksnes \u201cto negotiate with you with reference to a contract.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b904-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"854\">*854</page-number>McPherson testified that the Employer had shown no bias in its employment, whether with respect to men who had previously been members of the Union or to those who had been organized in late July or early August as a result of McPherson\u2019s activities. McPherson testified further that neither the Employer nor his representatives had interfered with his solicitation of the employees, either before August 7, before August 12th or thereafter, even at the job site when Struksnes himself was on the job and was aware of McPherson\u2019s activities.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b904-4\">In that setting, even when considered with an episode we next will reach, there was ample basis for the Board\u2019s conclusion that the General Counsel had failed to establish the allegations with respect to the claimed section 8(a) (5) violation. The record as a whole substantially supports that conclusion. There had been no strike, no evidence of anti-union animus as the Board found, no discrimination and no firing because of union activity.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> There had been no substantial evidence of coercion of the employees or of actual restraint of their exercising their section 7 rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-5\">But with respect to the section 8(a) (1) charge, the Employer had taken one step which we deem fateful.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We are by no means satisfied with the Board\u2019s ad hoc acquiescence in, if not approval of, the manner in which the Employer polled his men. Commencing some time after the McPherson letter of August 12, text <em>supra, </em>p. 853, Struksnes \u201cwent up and asked the guys. All I did was ask them. I told them what was up here, and I asked them to sign yes or no, and it wouldn\u2019t make any difference. It was up to those guys.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b904-11\">What \u201cwas up here\u201d on Exhibit No. 7 was the following question addressed to</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b904-12\">\u201cTHE MEN OF STRUCKSNES [ate] CONSTRUCTION CO.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b904-13\">\u201cDO YOU WANT ME TO BARGAIN WITH AND SIGN A CONTRACT WITH OPERATING ENGINEERS LOCAL 49?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b904-14\">\u201cPLEASE SIGN YOUR NAME AND ANSWER YES OR NO.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b904-15\">Twenty-four men signed their names \" upon that statement, nine voting \u201cyes,\u201d fifteen \u201cno,\u201d with one refusing to sign at all. The Employer had called no meeting of the men at which he might explain his purpose to ascertain whether or not the men desired a union contract on this particular job,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and assure them of no reprisals. Struksnes personally at the end of one shift presented the statement to each of the employees then available for his approach. His two foremen reached the remaining employees in like manner. How each man voted was known to the Employer or his foremen, not only at the time each man signed, but as a matter of record thereafter, just as the General Counsel\u2019s Exhibit 7 made manifest.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-16\">We can understand an inference that the men, members of the Union or not, might actually have voted in good faith not to have a union contract on this job; they might have wanted all the work they could get, even up to 9 P.M. on the second shift, before the \u201cfreeze-up\u201d and the darkness of winter set in, precluding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"855\">*855</page-number>further employment. The question on the Exhibit is equivocal to be sure, and seems not to have been directed to an ascertainment of union affiliation of the employees or of their activities, pro or con. On the other hand, as the Board itself has observed,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b905-4\">\u201c[A]ny employer who engages in interrogation does so with notice that he risks a finding of unfair labor practices if the circumstances are such that his interrogation restrains or interferes with employees in the exercise of their rights under the Act.\u201d <footnotemark>9</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b905-5\">But how can he know when he will be deemed to have acted at his peril ?</p>\n<p id=\"b905-6\">In the Board\u2019s Decision and Order in the <em>Lorben Corporation </em>case,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> the.Trial Examiner\u2019s findings, conclusions and recommendations were adopted. A section 8(a) (1) violation was found, notwithstanding the absence of expression of employer hostility to the union or of other unfair labor practices. The <em>Blue Flash </em>doctrine there deemed applicable by the Trial Examiner was adopted by the Board which noted specifically</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Afu-\">\u201c[W]e rely principally on the manner in which the poll was conducted, particularly the fact that Respondent did not explain the purpose of the poll to all of the employees, and did not offer or provide any assurances to the employees that their rights under the Act would not be infringed. Johnnie\u2019s Poultry Co., 146 NLRB 770.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b905-7\">Finding a section 8(a) (1) violation in the latter case, the Board at page 775 defined the purposes of an employer poll which have been held to be legitimate and pronounced \u201cspecific safeguards designed to minimize the coercive impact of such employer interrogation.\u201d One such was that the questioning \u201cmust occur in a context free from employer hostility to union organization and must not be itself coercive in nature.\u201d There the company attorney had interviewed the employees, explaining his status and his purpose in investigating a charge which the union had filed against the company. He assured each employee that his rights were protected by law and would be respected. Each employee had been asked to identify his signature on the photostat of his union authorization card, and other details were developed. There, said the Board, was an unfair labor practice; no, said the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-13\">The Board in the instant case has made no reference to its Johnnie\u2019s Poultry Co.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> doctrine. The Board here simply dismisses, <em>sub silentio, </em>the development of a permanent record of the votes of each employee set against his signature after interrogation had been conducted in personal approach by the employer and his foremen, and otherwise under the circumstances we outlined. Although a majority of the employees were members of the union, had they succumbed to coercion when they voted in the negative upon being queried as to whether or not they desired their employer to enter into a contract with their union? The Board\u2019s Decision and Order discloses no treatment of the possibly inherent restraint resulting from such contacts. There was no attempt at reconciliation of the Board\u2019s assessment of the situation here with the section 8(a) (1) violations as found by the Board in <em>Lorben, supra </em>note 10, and in <em>Johnnie\u2019s Poultry Co., supra </em>note 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-14\">We may assume that a year-round industrial establishment poses different problems from those arising on a road grading operation lasting only a few weeks or months. But the Act makes no exception for conditions thus varying, for it leaves treatment to the Board as a matter of policy. The rights of the employees must be safeguarded nonethe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"856\">*856</page-number>less. So it is we do not understand how the Board could approve the tactics here utilized, the technique employed, or the form in which ascertainment of the attitude of the men was sought.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-4\">In respect of the conclusion here reached by the Board,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> its reasoning seems to have applied and found satisfied the criteria suggested in <em>Blue Flash Express, Inc.</em><footnotemark><em>13</em></footnotemark><em> </em>In our judgment, that is not enough especially since the Board position clearly lacks vitality when its opinion notes \u201cthat Struksnes did not conduct this poll until after the union had declined to answer its query concerning the dates on which the members had joined.\u201d That statement was erroneous, as the Board later was bound to concede. (See note 4, <em>supra, </em>and related text.) Assuming that such \u201cdates\u201d were material, the Union\u2019s letter of August 12, text <em>supra, </em>p. 853, represented \u201cthat as of last Friday, August 9, I represent 20 men on Struksnes\u2019 job.\u201d That claim had been submitted in specific reply to Attorney Van Sickle\u2019s inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-12\">We think the Board should come to grips with this constantly recurring problem<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> for the protection of the employees as to their section 7 rights and for that of an employer acting in good faith. It would seem that the Board could, in the exercise of its expertise,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> develop appropriate policy considerations <footnotemark>16</footnotemark> and outline at least minimal standards to govern the ascertainment of union status, or even in given permissible situations, the desire of the employees respecting a contract with the Union.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b906-13\">We will set aside the Board\u2019s order and remand this case for further con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"857\">*857</page-number>sideration not inconsistent with this opinion.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b907-4\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b902-16\">.

Cf. note 17, <em>infra.)</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b906-9\">Of course the Board in the instant case, overruling its Trial Examiner, had found no unfair labor practice. Our own approach to their conflicting inferences and conclusions in terms of Univeral Camera Corp. v. N.L.R.B., 340 U.S. 474, 71 S.Ct. 456, 95 L.Ed. 456 (1951), is summarized inN.L.R.B. v.

On the other hand, neither he nor the Union could <em>know </em>\u2014 nor <em>could the Trial </em>Examiner\u2014 what result might flow from use of the questioned poll. In National Labor Relations Board v. Burnup &amp; Sims, Inc., 379 U.S. 21, 22, 85 S.Ct. 171, 13 L.Ed.2d 1 (1964), the Court observed that, on the record before it, \u00a7 8(a) (1) had been violated \u201cwhatever the employer\u2019s motive.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b906-19\">Rule-making in this area, it would seem, might have obviated the difficulty here as in many of the cases with which the Board says it has been \u201ccontinually confronted.\u201d Certainly the Board has rule-making authority as the Act expressly provides. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 156 (1964).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b907-9\">.

We have recognized that this principle applies when we review action of the National Labor Relations Board. In Internat\u2019l Woodworkers of America, Local Unions 6-7 and 6-122 v. National Labor Relations Board, 105 U.S.App.D.C. 37, 39, 263 F.2d 483, 485 (1959), we said: \u201cOn the record as a whole, we are unable to say this finding has no rational basis and it must therefore be affirmed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b907-14\">In the present case, the Board found that the employer\u2019s \u201cpurpose for conducting the poll was * * * to ascertain whether the Union represented a current majority\u201d; that \u201cthere is not other evidence of animus\u201d; and that the \u201cpolling of the employees under the circumstances of this case did not carry an implied threat of reprisals or in any other way interfere with, restrain, or coerce employees in the exercise of the rights guaranteed in Section 7 of the Act.\u201d The Board accordingly found that the General Counsel \u201cfailed to establish a violation of Section 8(a) (5) and (1) * * No doubt the Board might reasonably have found what my colleagues think it ought to have found.

Instead of deciding whether the Board\u2019s finding is or is not supported by \u201csubstantial evidence on the record considered' as a whole\u201d, or whether there is or is not \u201ca rational basis for the conclusions approved by the Administrative body\u201d, the court decides only that it disagrees with the Board: \u201cWe are by no means satisfied with the Board\u2019s ad hoc acquiescence in, if not approval of, the manner in which the Employer polled his men.\u201d (p. 854). The court considers as an original question, without regard to the Board\u2019s conclusions, whether or not the taking of the poll was an unfair labor practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-17\">I think the court errs, also, in remanding the case to the Board \u201cfor further <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"858\">*858</page-number>consideration * * * If there was no rational basis for the Board\u2019s order, it should be set aside and the' case should be remanded to the Board with a direction to find that the manner in which the employer polled the men was coercive.
