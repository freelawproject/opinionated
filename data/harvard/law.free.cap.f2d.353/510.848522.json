On motion of the union, the court issued an interim order providing in principal part \u201cthat the said defendants * * * are hereby enjoined and restrained from operating the M.A.N. stereotype plate-casting machine, unless the defendants employ at least two journeyman stereotypers in the operation of said machine pending determination by this Court of the prayers for relief in the amended complaint filed herein. * * * \u201d The court made no findings of fact to justify or support this order. The publisher has appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-13\">Rule 52(a), Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, expressly requires that \u201cin granting or refusing interlocutory injunctions the court shall * * * set forth the findings of fact and conclusions of law which constitute the grounds of its action.\u201d Similarly, Rule 65(d) provides that \u201c[ejvery order granting an injunction and every restraining order shall set forth the reasons for its issuanee.\u201d The appellee argues that the present order is merely a \u201cstay\u201d and therefore, is not covered by the quoted rules. We find it clear on the face of the order that it is an injunction issued without compliance with the controlling rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-17\">The order will be vacated and the cause remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
