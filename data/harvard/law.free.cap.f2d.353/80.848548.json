In answer the Board has requested enforcement of its order.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-21\">The Board concluded that the company violated \u00a7 8(a) (1) of the Act by (1) promulgating a rule which prohibited its employees from distributing union liter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>ature on their own time in non-working areas of the plant; and (2) interrogating employee Tommie Williams concerning his protected activities in such fashion as to constitute interference, restraint, and coercion within the meaning of the Act. The Board also found that the company violated \u00a7 8(a) (1), (3) and (4) of the Act by discriminatorily discharging Williams because of his union activities and his resort to the Board for assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">It is our conclusion that the record as a whole amply supports the findings and conclusions of the Board, and that the Board\u2019s order is valid and proper. See Republic Aviation Corp. v. N. L. R. B., 324 U.S. 793, 803, n. 10, 65 S.Ct. 982, 988, 89 L.Ed. 1372, 1379; N. L. R. B. v. Walton Mfg. Co. (5 Cir.) 289 F.2d 177, 180; N. L. R. B. v.

(5 Cir.) 315 F.2d 375. Accordingly, the petition to review is denied, and the Board\u2019s order is enforced.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
