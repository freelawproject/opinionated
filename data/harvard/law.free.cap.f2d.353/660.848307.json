Pan-Atlantic Steamship Corporation, 1956, 350 U.S. 124, 76 S.Ct. 232, 100 L.Ed. 133; Weyerhaeuser Steamship Company v. Nacirema Operating Co., 1958, 355 U.S. 563, 78 S.Ct. 438, 2 L.Ed.2d 491. Under the Sieracki line of decisions, a shipowner is liable to an employee of a stevedoring or ship-refitting company for an injury caused by negligence of the shipowner or unseaworthiness of the vessel on which the injured longshoreman or other employee <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>is working.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Ryan doctrine enables the shipowner to recover indemnity from the longshoreman\u2019s employer, when the unseaworthiness for which the shipowner is liable results from a breach of the stevedoring company\u2019s implied warranty of workmanlike service. Weyerhaeuser makes explicit a caveat implicit in Ryan: To recover indemnity, the shipowner\u2019s \u201cconduct on its part [must not have been] sufficient to preclude recovery\u201d. 355 U.S. at 567, 78 S.Ct. at 441. The Supreme Court did not declare just what conduct is sufficient to bar indemnification, although the Court did declare that \u201cin the area of contractual indemnity an application of the theories of \u2018active\u2019 or \u2018passive\u2019 as well as \u2018primary\u2019 or \u2018secondary\u2019 negligence is inappropriate.\u201d Id. at 569, 78 S.Ct. at 442. In the case before us the question was properly put to the jury. The jury decided that unseaworthiness was the proximate cause of the plaintiff\u2019s injuries and that the shipowner\u2019s conduct was \u201cso great as to preclude recovery of indemnity.\u201d We affirm the judgment based on the jury\u2019s verdicts.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">Francis David, a longshoreman employed by Atlantic &amp; Gulf Stevedores, Inc., was injured while working aboard Waterman\u2019s S.S. Arizpa in New Orleans. David was one of a gang of longshoremen opening and clearing a between-decks cargo hatch. On Waterman vessels, the hatch covers rest on a series of I-beams. The beams lie from port to starboard. At each end of the I-beam there is a wheel which runs along a metal track. A jack bar inserted into a cam engages and disengages the wheel. The end of the beam also rests on an upper guide rail as an additional safety precaution. To clear the hatch for loading or unloading cargo, the longshoremen first remove the hatch covers, then one man on each end engages the wheel by inserting the jack bar and rotating the cam. The other members of the gang, half on each end of the beam, roll the beam down to the end of the hatch by pulling with ropes or a metal pull bar inserted into a metal eye on each end of the beam. After they have rolled all of the I-beams down to the end of the hatch, the hatch is clear for loading of unloading.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-11\">On the morning of the accident, David\u2019s gang had already cleared the weather-deck cargo hatch without any difficulty. They then removed the hatch covers from the between-decks hatch and moved two of the I-beams to the end of the hatch without incident. David was operating the jack bar on the onshore end of the beams. As they were moving the third beam, the beam jumped the track at the offshore end and fell into the hold. The falling beam struck David and catapulted him into the hold. He was seriously injured.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-12\">David sued Waterman, the shipowner, alleging that his injuries were sustained as a result of unseaworthiness, \u201cspecifically, in that the track for the roller on said beam was not safely designed and the roller, which left the track, was worn and not fit for the use intended * In its answer, Waterman denied that the accident occurred in the manner alleged, denied the alleged unseaworthiness of the S.S. Arizpa and, as a special, alternative defense, pleaded contributory negligence on the part of David. Waterman filed a third party complaint against Atlantic &amp; Gulf Stevedores for indemnification based on the contention that Atlantic breached its warranty of due care. Waterman alleged that Atlantic was aboard the S.S. Arizpa in connection with performance of general stevedoring work and was in full custody and control of the areas where David allegedly sustained injury, that it was the duty of Atlantic to perform its work with due diligence and safety, and that any injuries sustained were caused by the neg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>ligence and fault of Atlantic. The jury returned a general verdict for David against Waterman in the amount of $84,000.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The jury returned a second general verdict denying Waterman\u2019s claim against Atlantic stevedores. The court rendered judgment in accordance with the verdicts.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-6\">Waterman\u2019s argument on appeal rests chiefly on the contention that the jury\u2019s answers to certain interrogatories required a judgment in its favor and, at the very least, were inconsistent with answers to other interrogatories.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In answer to the first two interrogatories, the jury found that the proximate cause of the accident was the unseaworthiness of the beam roller assembly. In answer to the seventh interrogatory, the jury found that Atlantic was negligent, and that the negligence \u201ccaused or brought into play\u201d the vessel\u2019s unseaworthiness. Waterman assumes that these findings necessarily required a verdict in its favor, relying on the Ryan and Crumady v. Joachim Hendrik Fisser, 1959, 358 U.S. 423, 79 S.Ct. 445, 3 L.Ed.2d 413 holdings that a shipowner cast for unseaworthiness may recover over against the employer of the injured seaman if the employer\u2019s negligence amounts to a breach of warranty of workmanlike performance. But the jury also found, replying to the eighth interrogatory, that the negligence did not constitute a breach of Atlantic\u2019s warranty to perform its job in a reasonably safe and workmanlike manner. The jury\u2019s answer to the tenth interrogatory is consistent with its answer to the eighth interrogatory: The unseaworthi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>ness of the vessel was \u201cso great as to preclude\u201d Waterman\u2019s recovery from Atlantic for breach of warranty.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-4\">It is the \u201cduty of the courts to attempt to harmonize the answers, if it is possible under a fair reading of them\u201d, and \u201cto reconcile the jury\u2019s findings, by exegesis if necessary * * * before we are free to disregard the jury\u2019s special verdict and remand the case for a new trial\u201d. Gallick v. Baltimore &amp; Ohio R. Co., 1963, 372 U.S. 108, 119, 83 S.Ct, 659, 666, 9 L.Ed.2d 618. If \u201cthere is a view of the case that makes the jury's answers to special interrogatories consistent, they must be resolved that way. For a search for one possible view of the case which makes the jury\u2019s finding inconsistent results in a collision with the Seventh Amendment.\u201d Atlantic &amp; Gulf Stevedores, Inc. v. Ellerman Lines, Ltd., 1962, 369 U.S. 355, 82 S.Ct. 780, 7 L.Ed. 2d 798.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-6\">The result the jury reached agrees with the Supreme Court\u2019s treatment of the stevedore\u2019s indemnity obligation as resting on contract, not tort principles.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The stevedore\u2019s negligence is immaterial unless it is a breach of the contractual warranty of workmanlike service and is the proximate cause of the longshoreman\u2019s injuries. And under the Weyerhaeuser dictum, the stevedore\u2019s breach of warranty may be excusable, if the shipowner\u2019s conduct is \u201csufficient to preclude recovery of indemnity\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-10\">The stevedore\u2019s \u201cwarranty of workman like service is comparable to a manufacturer\u2019s warranty of the soundness of its manufactured product. The shipowner\u2019s action is not changed from one for a breach of contract to one for a tort simply because recovery may turn upon the standard of the performance of petitioner\u2019s stevedoring service.\u201d Ryan, 350 U.S. at 133, 76 S.Ct. at 237. In a more recent case the Supreme Court, declining to take a bailment approach,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> again noted that the considerations underlying the stevedore\u2019s warranty are the same as those which \u201cunderlie a manufacturer\u2019s or seller\u2019s obligation to supply free of defects.\u201d Italia Societa, etc. v. Oregon Stevedoring Company, 1964, 376 U.S. 315, 323, 84 S.Ct. 748, 11 L.Ed.2d 732 (Griffith\u2019s case). See also Reed v. S.S. Yaka, 1963, 373 U.S. 410, 83 S.Ct. 1349, 10 L.Ed.2d 448. In Griffith\u2019s case, allowing indemnity, the Supreme Court held that \u201cthe absence of negligence on the part of a stevedore who furnishes defective equipment is not fatal to the shipowner\u2019s claim of indemnity based on the stevedore\u2019s implied warranty of workmanlike service.\u201d The Court said: \u201cAlthough in Ryan the stevedore was negligent, he was not found liable for negligence as such but because he failed to perform safely, a basis for liability including negligent and non-negligent conduct alike. * * * [Liability should fall upon the party best situated to adopt preventive measures and thereby reduce the likelihood of injury.\u201d 376 U.S. at 319, 84 S.Ct. at 751.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>In Weyerhaeuser the breach of contract was the stevedore\u2019s negligence. The Supreme Court said: \u201cIf * * * respondent (stevedoring company) rendered a substandard performance which led to foreseeable liability of petitioner (the owner), the latter was entitled to indemnity <em>absent conduct on its part sufficient to preclude recovery.\u201d </em>(emphasis added) 355 U.S. at 567, 78 S.Ct. at 441. The Court left no doubt that the law of contract determines what is \u201cconduct sufficient to preclude recovery.\u201d The Court cited sections 295 and 315 of the Restatement of Contracts (First). Section 295 provides that: \u201cIf a promisor prevents or hinders * * * the performance of a return promise, and the * * * return promise (would have) been rendered except for such prevention or hindrance * * * the actual or threatened nonperformance of the return promise does not discharge the promisor\u2019s duty * * * \u201d Section 315, entitled \u201cBreach by Preventing or Hindering Performance by the Other Party\u201d; reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-7\">\u201c(1) Prevention or hindrance by a party to a contract of any occurrence or performance requisite under the contract for the creation or continuance of a right in favor of the other party, or the discharge of a duty by him, is a breach of contract * * * <em>\u2019&gt;</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-21\"><em>\u201c(2) </em>Acts that would have been sufficient to hinder or prevent the occurrence of a condition or the performance of a return promise are not a breach of contract if the condition would not have occurred or the return promise have been performed had those acts not been done.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b715-22\">The Court cited section 571, 947, and 1264 of Corbin on Contracts dealing with excuse of a breach of contract through acts of the other party which hinder or prevent performance of the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-23\"> These contract principles are implicit in the Weyerhaeuser dictum.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> If a vessel\u2019s unseaworthiness prevents the stevedore\u2019s workmanlike performance, that is \u201cconduct\u201d on the part of the shipowner \u201csufficient to preclude recovery\u201d, and to excuse even a negligent breach by the stevedore. In Reddick v. McAllister Lighterage Line, Inc., 2 Cir. 1958, 258 F.2d 297, cert. denied 358 U.S. 908, 79 S.Ct. 235, 3 L.Ed.2d 229, for example, the court reversed, as clearly erroneous, a finding that the stevedore\u2019s fault required a judgment of indemnity in the shipowner\u2019s favor. The Second Circuit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>said: \u201cHowever, even if it was properly found that Clark (stevedore) by improper stowage breached its implied warranty of workmanlike service to McAllister (shipowner), a majority of the court thinks that there is no showihg that this breach caused Reddick\u2019s injury * * * Under the general test of foreseeability applied to contractual liability, a breach must have been the cause of the injury. We think that in this case the latent defect in the board on the top of the crate was an intervening cause which broke any causal chain that might otherwise have existed.\u201d 258 F.2d at 300. Similarly, the stevedore\u2019s warranty of workmanlike service does not put him under the duty to discover defects in equipment furnished him by the shipowner, such as a rotten rope. Ignatyuk v. Tramp Chartering Corp., 2 Cir. 1957, 250 F.2d 198.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-4\">In these cases and in the instant case, the factfinder\u2019s evaluation of the shipowner\u2019s conduct involves a weighing process. Thus, in Hagans v. Farrell Lines, Inc., 3 Cir. 1956, 237 F.2d 477, it was contended that an interrogatory concerning the stevedore\u2019s asserted negligence was answered in a way that was inconsistent with the general verdict. In answer, the Court said: \u201cWe think it a necessary conclusion from the question addressed to the court by the jury, and the general verdict (against the shipowner and in favor of the stevedore), that the jury must also have concluded that the defective winch was a substantial cause of the accident, and that the negligence of Lavina\u2019s (the stevedore\u2019s) employees was not a substantial cause of the accident.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b716-8\">Our task is not to decide whether the S. S. ARIZPA\u2019S unseaworthiness was a sufficiently material breach of the shipowner\u2019s warranty to excuse Atlantic\u2019s breach of the stevedore\u2019s warranty. That is the jury\u2019s task. So, in Weyerhaeuser the Supreme Court observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-9\">\u201cThe evidence bearing on these issues \u2014 petitioner\u2019s (owner\u2019s) action in making the shelter on its ship available to respondent\u2019s employees in Boston although it apparently was unsafe, as well as respondent\u2019s (stevedores\u2019) continued use of the shelter for five days thereafter without inspection \u2014 was for jury consideration under appropriate instructions.\u201d 355 U.S. at 567, 78 S.Ct. at 441.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b716-10\">And see McNamara v. Weichsel Damp. A. G. Kiel, 2 Cir. 1961, 293 F.2d 900, 904; Moore-McCormack Lines, Inc. v. Maryland Ship Ceiling Co., 4 Cir. 1962, 311 F.2d 663.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-11\">Here the jury concluded that in spite of Atlantic\u2019s negligence, the defective roller beam assembly was the proximate cause of the accident and amounted to conduct on the part of the shipowner sufficient to preclude indemnification. We cannot say that the jury was confused or inconsistent or that the record fails to support the jury\u2019s finding.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b716-12\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b711-14\">.

Even if there is no contract between the stevedoring company and the shipowner, the stevedore still has an independent duty to exercise due care in performing his work aboard the ship. There is much to be said for a tort approach. Baer, Admiralty Law of the Supreme Court, \u00a7 2-9 at 197-198. In tort the courts could apply the traditional maritime law technique of comparative fault as between shipowner and stevedoring company. See American Stevedores, Inc. v.

In a recent comment the author suggests : \u201cThe obligations owed by the shipowner\u201d are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-11\">1) To exercise ordinary care in placing the ship and its appliances in such a condition that an experienced stevedore, aware of the normal dangers expected to arise in the ship\u2019s service, may, by the exercise of reasonable care, discharge his obligations in a workmanlike manner with reasonable safety to persons and property;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-12\">2) To provide reasonable warning of any hidden or latent dangers not usually or reasonably expected by an experienced stevedore, provided that the shipowner know of, or, with reasonable care under the circumstances, should have known of the danger and that it was danger such as the stevedore would normally encounter in the performance of his services; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-16\">3) To refrain from materially burdening, delaying, or interfering with the performance of the stevedoring operator in an unreasonable manner.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b715-26\">The use of a breach of any of these obligations as a measure of conduct sufficient to preclude recovery has gained favor in subsequent holdings, does not appear to conflict with any existing determination by the Supreme Court, and could provide reasonable content to the Weyerhaeuser principle.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-27\">It may be noted that a latent defect causing injury may interfere with indemnification in two ways. If the defect is within the knowledge of the shipowner and no warning is given, the shipowner may not be allowed to recover. However, the latent nature of a defect not within the knowledge of the shipowner will preclude the foreseeability requirement necessary to the liability of stevedores.

Waterman attacks the admission of evidence that the upper guide rail was defective, because the evidence was based on an inspection several years after the accident. This error was not prejudicial, since there was substantial other evidence before the jury to support a verdict of unseaworthiness. At any rate the admission of this type of evidence was within the sound discretion of the trial judge. See McCormick, Evidence sec. 167 at 350; 2 Wigmore, Evidence (3rd ed.) sec. 437 at 414. Admiralty practice tends to admit evidence excludible in common law courts. American Cyanamid Co. v. China Union Lines, Ltd., 5 Cir., 1962, 306 F.2d 135. Thus, this Circuit recognizes the rule that subsequent events may accurately reflect earlier conditions. Avera v. Florida Towing Corp., 5 Cir. 1963, 322 F.2d 155, 162 &amp; n. 12.
