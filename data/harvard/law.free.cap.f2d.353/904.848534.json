After a hearing, the trial examiner found the assistant engineers were employees subject to the Act and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"905\">*905</page-number>that, with respect to them, the Company had violated the enumerated sections. The Board reversed and dismissed the complaint, holding both chief and assistant engineers were supervisors within the meaning of Section 2(11) of the Act and, therefore, were not employees as defined in Section 2(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b955-4\">It is agreed by the parties, and we concur, that if the Board correctly concluded the chief and assistant engineers were supervisors and not employees within the meaning of the Act, its action must be upheld. We hold there is substantial evidence in the record, considered as a whole, to support the Board\u2019s findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b954-25\">. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 151 et seq.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
