The Bank appeals from Judge Bonsai\u2019s award of summary judgment in favor of the government. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-9\">The facts, which are not in dispute, disclose that on December 2, 1953, Eliza Findley applied to the Bank for a property improvement loan in the amount of $2,000. At the Bank\u2019s request, the appropriate papers were submitted, including an FHA Title I Credit Application, bearing the signatures of the borrower and co-maker of the note \u2014 one \u201cVictoria North\u201d\u2014 and a \u201cCredit Statement of Comaker.\u201d In addition, a certified, copy of the deed to the property to be improved, listing Eliza Findley and Victoria North as grantees, was exhibited to an employee of the Bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-12\">As part of its routine credit investigation, a Bank investigator telephoned \u201cMcGuire Realty,\u201d the firm listed on the \u201cCredit Statement of Co-maker\u201d as Victoria North\u2019s employer, and was advised that she had been employed for two years and that there were no existing attachments upon her salary.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Relying upon this investigation, as well as the papers submitted, the Bank decided to make the loan, and on December 4, 1953, a note was signed by Eliza Findley as borrower and Victoria North as co-maker.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-13\">After making one payment of $62.08, the borrower defaulted. On December 16, 1954, the loan matured and shortly thereafter, the Bank obtained judgments against both borrower and co-maker. Two years later, the Bank learned and advised the FHA that \u201cVictoria North\u201d had used the names \u201cGwen Morgan\u201d and \u201cMary Elizabeth Morgan\u201d in connection with two other FHA insured loans.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-14\">On December 26, 1958, the Bank submitted a Title I Claim for Loss to the FHA pursuant to its Contract of Insurance on the defaulted promissory note. The Bank warranted in this Claim for Loss that it had complied with the terms of the insurance contract and the Regulations promulgated under the National Housing Act. In assigning the defaulted promissory note to the government, the Bank endorsed on it \u201cAll right, title and interest of the undersigned is hereby assigned without warranty (except that the note qualifies for insurance), to the United States.\u201d On March 16, 1959, the FHA paid the Bank\u2019s claim in the amount of $1,028.56 (the balance of the loan remaining after certain postmaturity pay<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>ments). Then, in December 1959, the FHA demanded reimbursement from the Bank, claiming that the loan was not eligible for insurance because of noncompliance with the Regulations since the signatures of \u201call parties to the note\u201d were not \u201cgenuine.\u201d When the Bank refused reimbursement, the Government brought this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-4\">Both parties moved for summary judgment. Judge Bonsai, in granting the government\u2019s cross-motion for summary judgment, held that the Bank had breached its warranty to the FHA because the signature \u201cVictoria North\u201d on the promissory note was not \u201cgenuine\u201d-within the meaning of 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 201.2(a).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">This piquant case is not without its puzzling aspects. The meaning of the second sentence of 24 C.F.R. 201.2(a), \u201cThe signatures of all parties to the note must be genuine,\u201d must be determined in the light of its context and purpose. The previous sentence requires that \u201cThe note shall bear the genuine signature of the borrower as maker, shall be valid and enforceable against the borrower or borrowers as defined in \u00a7 201.l(i), and shall be complete and regular on its face.\u201d The tests of the second and third clauses would seem to have been met, for \u201cVirginia North\u201d could not have defended on the ground that her real name was Mary Gwendolyn Rosita Morgan. But, the Regulations are not satisfied for insurance purposes merely because the note was \u201cenforceable.\u201d They make clear, as we have indicated, that the signature of all parties must be <em>genuine. </em>\u00a7 201.5(b) casts light on the purpose for such a <em>sine qua non. </em>That regulation requires that the credit information relied upon by the insured must, in its judgment, clearly show the borrower to be solvent, \"with reasonable ability to pay the obligation and in other respects a reasonable credit risk.\u201d See also \u00a7 200.167. And, \u00a7 201.5 (a) commands that \u201cPrior to making a loan the insured shall obtain a dated credit application executed by the borrower on a form approved by the Commissioner * * * In addition, the loan file shall contain either a commercial credit report on the borrower or evidence of the lender\u2019s investigation of the borrower\u2019s credit.\u201d This requirement, read with the proscription of \u00a7 201.5(c) that no disbursement shall be made if the insured has knowledge that the borrower is more than 15 days overdue on any obligation owing to or insured by the Federal Government, manifests that the use of a false name would impair if not preclude adequate checking of the answers to the questions in the Credit Application and make it difficult if not impossible for the insured effectively to carry out its disbursement duties under \u00a7 201.5(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b360-10\">The Bank's contention that the co-maker\u2019s signature was \u201cgenuine\u201d because it was made by a person not fictitious, whom the Bank considered the comaker and the co-owner of the property, is not persuasive for it misses the point on this appeal. We are not called upon to decide whether the Bank could enforce its claim against the borrower or comaker ; nor is this a situation where the Bank would not be liable for cashing a check drawn to the order of an impostor. Cf. International Union Bank v. National Surety Company, 245 N.Y. 368, 157 N.E. 269, 52 A.L.R. 1375 (1927); Cohen v. Lincoln Savings Bank, 275 N.Y. 399, 10 N.E.2d 457 (1937). The question we must decide is whether the note was uninsurable and the contractual warranties were breached because the co-maker\u2019s signature was not \u201cgenuine\u201d within the meaning and context of the Regulations. This we have answered in the affirmative.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-11\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b359-15\">. In its brief on appeal, the appellee pointed out that the telephone number given for Eliza Findley on her \u201cRequest for Application\u201d was the same as that given for Victoria North\u2019s alleged employer (McGuire Realty) on the \u201cCredit Statement of the Co-maker.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b360-6\">. In May 1958, the co-maker (Mary Gwendolyn Rosita Morgan) pleaded guilty to a Criminal Information filed in the Eastern District of New York, charging her with a conspiracy to defraud the United States in this loan transaction in signing the Credit Application and the Credit Statement of Co-maker as \u201cVictoria North.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b360-12\">MOORE, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"A_Q\">(dissenting):</p>\n<p id=\"AoU2\">The majority concede that the note signed by Victoria North as co-maker was \u201cenforceable\u201d and \u201ccomplete and reg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>ular on its face.\u201d Reliance for the result reached is placed upon the requirement that \u201cThe signatures of all parties to the note must be genuine,\u201d 24 C.F.R. 201.2(a). The opinion merely concludes by its own fiat and without reference to other controlling sections of the applicable statutes or to New York decisions that the co-maker\u2019s signature was not \u201cgenuine.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b361-4\">There can be no factual dispute that the co-owner (with Eliza Findley) of the property to be improved was \u201cVictoria North.\u201d She was an actual person and for purposes of owning the property was Victoria North, one of the record title owners. Nor can there be any question that the signature on the note was the actual or \u201cgenuine\u201d signature of the Victoria North to whom the Citibank intended to make the improvement loan. Query, whether the use by Victoria North of other or different names in other transactions with other persons makes her signature in a transaction wherein she was using the name Victoria North any less genuine ?</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">\u201cEven though the name which was signed might originally have been assumed with other fraudulent purpose, the instrument would still not be false or forged if, in fact, it was made by the person who purported and was understood to be the maker.\u201d International Union Bank v. National Surety Company, 245 N.Y. 368, 374, 157 N.E. 269, 271. \u201cThe name by which [the payee, here Victoria North] is designated is merely the tag by which the intended person may be identified.\u201d Cohen v. Lincoln Savings Bank, 275 N.Y. 399, 405, 10 N.E. 2d 457, 460. Thus, \u201ceven though [the payee] induced the maker to deal with him through fraudulent misrepresentation as to his responsibility, character or name, [he] is the real payee and can by indorsement transfer title to the instrument.\u201d Id. p. 406, 10 N.E.2d p. 460.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">This case, however, should not be decided upon abstract theories of the meaning of the word \u201cgenuine.\u201d Other FHA regulations create, control and limit the lender\u2019s [insured\u2019s] liability. Regulation 201.5(b) provides: \u201cIf after the loan is made, an insured who acted in good faith discovers any material misstatements * * * the eligibility of the note for insurance will not be affected.\u201d When discovery was made by Citibank that another name, Mary Gwendolyn Rosita Morgan <footnotemark>*</footnotemark> had also been used by Victoria North, Citibank immediately complied with the requirement that \u201cthe insured shall promptly report such discovery to the Commissioner.\u201d \u00a7 201.5(b). Also applicable is 24 C.F.R. 201.6(f) which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-9\">\u201c(f) <em>Reliance on Credit Application. </em>An insured acting in good faith may in the absence of information to the contrary, rely upon all statements of fact made by the borrower, which are called for by the borrower\u2019s credit application, in determining the eligibility of the loan.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b361-10\">The trial court based its decision almost exclusively on a plea of guilty entered by Mary Gwendolyn Rosita Morgan (Victoria North) in 1958, five years after the original note was executed and two years after Citibank notified FHA of the dual name situation saying \u201cher plea of guilty in the Eastern District establishes conclusively that her intent was to defraud the United States by concealing the existence of a fixed obligation,\u201d and although conceding that \u201cher plea was with respect to the Credit Application and Credit Statement, the same intent must be assumed in the use of the name in signing as co-maker the note which followed the Credit Application and Credit Statement.\u201d I can find no logical or factual basis for this assumption. Nor is there any legal ground for the conclusion that \u201csince the signature of Victoria North was made with intent to defraud, it is not \u2018genuine\u2019 under Regulation 201.2 * * Regulation 201.5(b) must have been intended to cover just such a situation as is here presented, namely, an insured \u201cwho acted in good <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>faith\u201d (and there is no proof to the contrary) and who \u201cafter the loan is made\u201d discovered \u201cmaterial misstatements.\u201d But the use of the second name (Victoria North) since it was descriptive of the co-owner of the property might well not have been a misstatement at all. However, even were there fraudulent misrepresentation, Citibank was entitled to the umbrella of protection raised over it by Cohen v. Lincoln Savings Bank, supra, and International Union Bank v. National Surety Company, supra, in which fraudulent purpose was assumed.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-4\">For these reasons, I would reverse the order granting summary judgment in favor of plaintiff and grant summary judgment for the defendant, dismissing the complaint.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b361-11\"> The names \u201cGwen Morgan\u201d and \u201cMary Elizabeth Morgan\u201d also were used.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
