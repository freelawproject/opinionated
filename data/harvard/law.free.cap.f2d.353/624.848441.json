He asserts that his conviction was based upon evidence (the 114 pounds of marihuana) secured through an unconstitutional search and seizure of two suitcases and a briefcase at the Los Angeles International Airport.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">Los Angeles police had observed a recurring pattern in incidents involving the illicit transportation of marihuana. Large lots of marihuana were being brought to Los Angeles from Mexico by automobile, then carried from Los Angeles to New York City in the luggage of persons traveling on commercial air flights. The couriers were Latin-Americans. They traveled first class on nonstop flights. They did not make advance reservations. Their luggage was new and expensive, usually bore the brand name \u201cVentura,\u201d and had combination locks. Their bags were exceedingly heavy because of the weight of the marihuana. They paid their fares and weight overcharges in cash with bills of large denomination. Eight such cases had been investigated in the two years preceding appellant\u2019s apprehension. Sergeant Butler, who searched appellant\u2019s bags, had participated personally in four such investigations during the preceding year \u2014 one, a week prior to the search of appellant\u2019s bags.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-6\">Airport employees were asked to notify the police immediately if a person fitting the described pattern appeared. At about 8:30 p. m. on April 5, 1964, a ticket agent at the Los Angeles airport called the airport police substation. Sergeant Butler responded. The ticket agent told him that a person later identifield as appellant had purchased a first-class ticket on a 10:50 p. m. nonstop flight to New York, that he had no advance reservation, that his two bags weighed 155 pounds (115 pounds in excess of the 40 pounds which could be carried without additional charge), and that he had paid for his fare and overweight charges with one hundred-dollar bills.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-8\">Sergeant Butler went to the storage area in the airport terminal building where appellant\u2019s bags had been sent to await loading. The bags were new \u201cVentura\u201d bags with combination locks. Sergeant Butler lifted them to feel their weight. He pressed their sides together, forcing air from the interior. Smelling the escaping air, he detected the odor of marihuana and called the police department\u2019s narcotics division. Two officers responded. They too lifted the bags, squeezed them, and smelled the escaping \u00e1ir. They and Sergeant Butler then located appellant upstairs in a public bar in the terminal building and arrested him. The bags were opened after appellant\u2019s arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-9\">The government argues that the bags were not searched until they were opened. We cannot agree. The manipulation of appellant\u2019s bags by Sergeant Butler prior to appellant\u2019s arrest constituted a \u201csearch\u201d within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment. The contents of the bags were not exposed to Sergeant Butler\u2019s sight or smell before the bags were squeezed. He detected the odor of marihuana as the result of an \u201cexploratory investigation,\u201d an \u201cinvasion or quest,\u201d a \u201cprying into hidden places for that which was concealed\u201d \u2014 conduct which has been repeatedly said to characterize a \u201csearch.\u201d 38 Words &amp; Phrases 401-02 (Perm. 2d), 123-26 (1965 P.P.) Technical trespass is not required. Silverman v. United States, 365 U.S. 505, 511, 81 S.Ct. 679, 5 L.Ed.2d 734 (1961). See also Regalado v. California, 374 U.S. 497, 83 S.Ct. 1875, 10 L.Ed.2d 1044 (1963); McDonald v. United States, 335 U.S. 451, 454 (1948) But even if it were, it occurred here. \u201cA trespass to a chattel may be committed by intentionally * * * using or intermeddling with a chattel in the possession of another.\u201d Restatement 2d, Torts \u00a7 217 (1964). See also Prosser, Law of Torts 76 (3d ed. 1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b677-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>The question remains whether the search of appellant\u2019s bags violated the Fourth Amendment. Sergeant Butler had no warrant. Hence the search was invalid unless made (1) incident to a lawful arrest, or (2) in \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d \u2014 in this ease, that contraband was threatened with imminent removal or destruction. United States v. Ventresca, 380 U.S. 102, 106-107, 107 n. 2, 85 S.Ct. 741, 13 L.Ed.2d 684 (1965); Cipres v. United States, 343 F.2d 95, 98 n. 9 (9th Cir. 1965). See also Chapman v. United States, 365 U.S. 610, 614-616, 81 S.Ct. 776, 5 L.Ed.2d 828 (1961); United States v. Jeffers, 342 U.S. 48, 51, 72 S.Ct. 93, 96 L.Ed. 59 (1951); Johnson v. United States, 333 U.S. 10, 14-15, 68 S.Ct. 367, 92 L.Ed. 436 (1948).</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">(1) We hold that the search was not incident to appellant\u2019s subsequent arrest in the upstairs bar \u2014 not because it was too \u201cremote in time or place from the arrest\u201d [see Preston v. United States, 376 U.S. 364, 367, 84 S.Ct. 881, 883, 11 L.Ed. 2d 777, (1964)] (a question we do not reach) \u2014 but rather, because the search was in fact independent of the arrest. Sergeant Butler did not go to the storage area to arrest appellant and incidentally search him and his bags. He knew appellant was not there. His sole purpose was to search the bags. See Lustig v. United States, 338 U.S. 74, 79-80, 69 S.Ct. 1372, 93 L.Ed. 1819 (1949); Jones v. United States, 357 U.S. 493, 500, 78 S.Ct. 1253, 2 L.Ed.2d 1514 (1958); Taylor v. United States, 286 U.S. 1, 6, 52 S.Ct. 466, 76 L.Ed. 951 (1932).</p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">(2) The burden rested on the government to prove that it would not have been practical to secure a warrant before the bags were removed. United States v. Jeffers, 342 U.S. 48, 51, 72 S.Ct. 93, 96 L.Ed. 59 (1951). Cf. Cohen v. Norris, 300 F.2d 24, 32 (9th Cir. 1962). The police were first contacted at 8:30 p. m. Appellant and his luggage were scheduled to depart at 10:50 p. m. There was uncontradicted testimony that a warrant could not have been obtained until the following morning. Compare Johnson v. United States, supra, 333 U.S. at 15, 68 S.Ct. 367. Absent contrary evidence, this was a sufficient showing.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-13\">The fact that it was impractical to secure a warrant \u201cdid not dispense with the need for probable cause.\u201d Henry v. United States, 361 U.S. 98, 104, 80 S.Ct. 168, 172, 4 L.Ed.2d 134 (1959). The trial court concluded that Sergeant Butler had reasonable grounds to believe that the bags contained contraband\u2014 though thinking it \u201ca very close question.\u201d \u201cGiving due weight to that finding,\u201d Wong Sun v. United States, 371 U.S. 471, 479, 83 S.Ct. 407, 413, 9 L.Ed. 2d 441 (1963), we arrive at the same conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-14\">\u201cThe troublesome line * * * is one between mere suspicion and probable cause. That line necessarily must be drawn by an act of judgment formed in the light of the particular situation and with account taken of all the circumstances.\u201d Brinegar v. United States, 338 U.S. 160, 176, 69 S.Ct. 1302, 1311, 93 L.Ed. 1879 (1949). No one of the indicia drawn from prior incidents of illicit traffic was alone sufficient to justify a reasonable man in the belief that appellant\u2019s bags contained contraband, but taken together they rendered it probable. A search based upon their concurrence would not likely invade the privacy of an innocent person. See Sobel, Search &amp; Seizure 52 (1964). Compare Ellis v. United States, 105 U.S.App.D.C. 86, 264 F.2d 372, 374 (1959).</p>\n<p id=\"b677-15\">No doubt first-class passengers do not always make reservations, and heavy luggage is not unusual. But there was testimony that it is \u201cvery, very rare\u201d for a first-class passenger who has heavy luggage to appear and purchase a ticket without prior arrangement.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> There was also testimony that it is difficult to pack <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>as much as 155 pounds of personal effects into two ordinary suitcases, but that bags containing bricks of marihuana seized in earlier incidents had comparable weights. These elements, taken together with the use of \u201cVentura\u201d combination-lock suitcases, paym\u00e9nt in bills of large denomination, and the apparent Latin-American derivation of the passenger, were specific and narrowly descriptive; illuminated by Sergeant Butler\u2019s past experience, they furnished reasonable grounds for him to believe, in advance of the intrusion upon appellant\u2019s privacy, that appellant\u2019s suitcases contained another shipment of marihuana moving in an organized illicit traffic from the Mexican source of supply to the New York market. Indeed, it has been suggested that less might have been sufficient: \u201cThe police must have reasonable grounds to believe that the particular package carried by the citizen is contraband. Its shape and design might at times be adequate. The weight of it and the manner in which it is carried might at times be enough.\u201d Henry v. United States, 361 U.S. 98, 104, 80 S.Ct. 168, 172, 4 L.Ed.2d 134 (1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">As appellant states, Sergeant Butler had no prior information that a crime would be committed at this time or place or by this appellant. But probable cause \u201cis a practical, nontechnical conception.\u201d Brinegar v. United States, supra, 338 U.S. at 176, 69 S.Ct. at 1311 \u2014no particular element must always be present; the presence of no one element is invariably conclusive. The presence or absence of probable cause is to be determined \u201cin the light of * * * all the circumstances,\u201d <em>ibid. </em>\u2014 it is immaterial that each circumstance, taken by itself, may be consistent with innocence. See United States v. Bianco, 189 F.2d 716, 720 (3d Cir. 1951).</p>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">To sustain the finding of probable cause on this record is not to authorize officers to conduct general searches for unknown offenders on mere suspicion. A search cannot be used as an investigative technique for securing evidence of the commission of crime. Cf. Stanford v. State of Texas, 379 U.S. 476, 481-484, 85 S.Ct. 506, 13 L.Ed.2d 431 (1965); Note, 28 U.Chi.L.Rev. 664, 697 (1961); Kamisar, 44 Minn.L.Rev. 891, 914 (1960). The circumstances upon which Sergeant Butler relied were within his knowledge <em>before </em>the search was initiated, and were sufficient to justify a reasonable man in believing that the very bags which Sergeant Butler searched did in fact contain marihuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-8\">Following appellant\u2019s arrest a search of his person revealed a key to an airport locker. The police opened the locker and found a briefcase. They opened the briefcase and discovered two bricks of marihuana, part of the total of 114 pounds to which the one-count indictment related. It is not clear whether appellant intended, to contest the validity of this search independently of his attack upon the search of his suitcases. Since there may be practical reasons for not doing so, in view of our holding that the latter search was valid, we do not consider that issue, leaving it to appellant to raise it on petition for rehearing if he wishes to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-9\">Affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-10\">Upon Petition for Rehearing</p>\n<p id=\"b678-11\">Responding to the suggestion of the Court, appellant requested that we consider the issue reserved in the final sentence of the Court\u2019s opinion. We have done so.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-12\">POPE and MERRILL, Circuit Judges, are of the view that, in the circumstances of this case, the error, if any, was harmless. The judgment of affirmance is therefore adhered to.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-13\">Affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-14\">BROWNING, Circuit Judge, dissents on the ground that the warrantless search of the locker was unlawful, and that the admission of evidence resulting from the search was not harmless.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b677-7\">. Compare United States v. Bianco, 189 F.2d 716, 720 (3d Cir. 1951) (\u201cThe use of so large a case for so short a trip [Baltimore to Washington, D.C.] was extraordinary\u201d). See also People v. McGowan, 415 Ill. 375, 114 N.E.2d 407, 410-411 (S.Ct.Ill.1953).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
