After taking an appeal to this Court, the prisoner decided he wished to remain at the Federal Detention Headquarters in New York City pending the determination of his appeal. In order to remain at the Federal Detention Headquarters it was necessary for the prisoner to elect \u201cnot to commence service of said sentence.\u201d Accordingly, he signed a document entitled \u201cElection Against Service of Sentence\u201d that not only contained a plain statement that Heap elected not to commence service of the sentence, but also the following: \u201cI have been informed and I fully understand that, as long as my election not to serve remains in effect, the sentence of imprisonment shall be stayed.\u201d He made no application for release on bail thereafter and the judgment of conviction was affirmed by us on May 4,1965, United States v. Heap, 2 Cir., 345 F.2d 170.. The result was that no credit against service of his sentence was given for the time of incarceration at the Federal Detention Headquarters in the interval between the election \u201cnot to commence service of said sentence\u201d and the affirmance, a period of about a year.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>After due consideration of all aspects of the election procedure, Congress may amend the existing law. As matters now stand the courts are without power to afford relief, however, and the appeal from Judge Sugarman\u2019s order denying the prisoner\u2019s application for a reduction of sentence is affirmed. Appellant\u2019s reliance on Short v. United States, D.C. Cir., 1965, 344 F.2d 550 is misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
