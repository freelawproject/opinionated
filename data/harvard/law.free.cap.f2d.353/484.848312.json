While Judge Weinfeld\u2019s opinion makes no specific reference to the allegations that appellant was deprived \u201cof the fruits of his labors in introducing a new line to the shoe trade,\u201d it is clear from the context that this item was not overlooked. As with appellant\u2019s other claims on the merits, the difference between the issues litigated before the arbitrators and those attempted to be presented in this subsequent litigation is one of semantics only. The introduction of \u201ca new line to the shoe trade\u201d turns out to refer not to shoes but to \u201cfabrics for the shoe trade\u201d and thus is in the category of the goods appellant was to sell under his contract of February 26, 1948. Appellant was afforded the fullest opportunity to present his proofs to the arbitrators and he did so. Arbitration would be of little value if the entire controversy or any part thereof could be reopened later by a mere change in the words or phrases used to characterize the matters included in the claim the arbitrators had rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-22\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
