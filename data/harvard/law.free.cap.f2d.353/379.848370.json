For several months, 1952-1953, the boxes and barrels were out of storage in the hands of a trusted employee of Miss Lattimore\u2019s, who unpacked about everything in search of one or more items of which Miss Lattimore wanted to make present use. He condensed the contents of 18 barrels into 13 and returned them and the tea boxes to storage. By 1955, Miss Lattimore had taken a small apartment in the Mark Hopkins Hotel in San Francisco and ordered the storage company to deliver her collected objects to the apartment at a time when she was absent from the city. Upon her return, she found the contents of her boxes and barrels spread all over the floor of the apartment in broken or scratched or otherwise damaged condition, and many, many items were missing. Damage and loss based on fair market value was $26,000, about $8,000 of which was alleviated by insurance. The district court found that the \u201closs was caused by agencies outside the control of plaintiff.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b430-14\">The fair market value of the items was found as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b430-15\">a. Smashed and broken items ..................$12,490.00</p>\n<p id=\"b430-17\">b. Missing items ......... 12,140.00</p>\n<p id=\"b430-18\">c. Items soiled and crushed requiring restoration ... 1,370.00</p>\n<p id=\"b430-20\">To the extent she was uninsured, the taxpayer attempted to establish a casualty loss on her federal income taxes for 1955, which in her case, if she had a permissible deduction, would have involved also a loss carry back for the years 1954 and 1953. Assuming she had a deduction, she sought to recover a portion of her taxes by suit. (She had previously been in the Tax Court where her case was dismissed without a decision on the merits.) <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> If the deduction was valid, she was entitled to a refund of $4,310.77. The district court upheld her contentions and ordered judgment for that amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-21\">The government appeals asserting that the proof did not amount to a showing of \u201cother casualty\u201d under Section 165(c) (3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and that it was not enough to just prove fair market value at the time of the loss or damage.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-22\">The finding that \u201cthe loss was caused by agencies outside the control of plaintiff, was destructive in effect * * * \u201d is rather sketchy, but listing the items: \u201csmashed and broken\u201d and \u201cmissing items\u201d seem to describe a casualty and have an element of suddenness in them, which seems to be required for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>casualty<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In the items \u201csoiled and crushed, $1,370.00,\u201d there might be a question as to the deductibility of soiling which may have been caused by moisture about which one witness testified. But we know of no reason that this item could not be divided as to crushing and soilage and the soilage apportioned with the insurance recovery. Before the tax court, the government seemed to concede that fair market value would be the basis for determining the loss. But we cannot say it waived it forever because in the pretrial joint partial agreed statement of facts, the parties listed as one question for the court: \u201cThe necessity for a cost basis in claimed deductions for casualty loss.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">It is clear enough that the same necessity exists on a deduction for casualty loss as on a sale: a prior \u201cbasis,\u201d cost or otherwise. See Sections 165, 1011, 1012, 1014 and 1015 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">The stipulation of the parties says Miss Lattimore acquired the items involved in her loss by gift and inheritance, yet in her testimony she says she bought some of the items (apparently some in San Francisco and others as she traveled), some were from her mother (inheritance?) and some were gifts. As Miss Lattimore testified in court, she was not held to her counsel\u2019s stipulation of gift and inheritance as sources.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-15\">We must reverse. It is not unfair to the taxpayer, and we hold the law makes it mandatory, for her to identify the items she bought, giving the cost or a close approximation of what she paid and to identify the items she inherited, establishing the basis provided in Section 1014(a).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> (Generally, the value at decedent\u2019s death.) On the third category: gifts, the taxpayer is not entirely at the mercy of the limbo of the past. On the gifts, taxpayer may well satisfy the court and the Internal Revenue Service that she is entitled to something.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b431-16\">As to \u201cother casualty,\u201d the test of Section 165(c) (3), if the court by a preponderance of the evidence finds that certain items were probably stolen and certain items were probably damaged by vandalism or other rough sudden usage, we would uphold it.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The \u201csoiled or crushed\u201d items seem on shaky ground. Was the soiling from slowly accumulated moisture, vandalism or mishandling? Did soiling or crushing occur first ? How much damage was attributable to each cause ?</p>\n<p id=\"b431-17\">One cannot go through the record without becoming convinced that the taxpayer is entitled to some deduction for her loss. On both sides there is a little intransigence. The taxpayer\u2019s counsel insists, \u201cI will prove it my way.\u201d The government, conceding nothing, says, \u201cYou can\u2019t prove it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b431-18\">Reversed and remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b430-10\">.
