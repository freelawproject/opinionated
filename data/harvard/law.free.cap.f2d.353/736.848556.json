In fact, Respondent does not appeal the Board\u2019s finding of unlawful secondary boycott activity in No. 21386.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-24\">Respondent\u2019s primary contention in both cases is that the orders issued by the Board were unduly broad in scope, in that they not only prohibited future violations against the immediate parties but precluded Respondent from engaging in such conduct against \u201cAny other person similarly engaged in commerce or in an industry affecting commerce\u201d in No. 21385 and against \u201cany other person\u201d in No. 21386.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>Under the circumstances of these cases, we cannot say that the scope of the orders was too broad. The Board stated that the broad language was \u201cnecessary because of the extent to which the Respondent has demonstrated a proclivity to engage in unlawful secondary activities.\u201d This finding, supported by the Record, affords sufficient justification for the breadth of the orders. Truck Drivers &amp; Helpers Local Union No. 728 v. N. L. R. B., 5th Cir. 1964, 332 F.2d 693, at 697, cert. denied 379 U.S. 913, 85 \u00a7 158(b) (4) (i), (ii) (B).</p>\n<p id=\"b787-4\">Accordingly, the orders in both cases are enforced.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
