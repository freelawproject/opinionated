This appeal followed:</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">Each of the plaintiffs was employed by defendant.as a regional manager pursuant to the provisions of a written, form contract executed by the parties. Each plaintiff was discharged from employment within one year after his contract had been signed.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">The controversy relates to the construction of the following provisions of the contracts, to-wit:</p>\n<p id=\"b556-7\">\u201cThis agreement shall be effective from the date of execution and shall remain in effect for a period of twelve months and will be automatically renewed for twelve-month terms unless sooner terminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-8\">\u201cThis agreement may be terminated by either party upon written notice or by Manager\u2019s death.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b556-9\">Plaintiffs do not question the adequacy of the notice given if defendant had the legal right to terminate the contracts within the first year of their life.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-10\">Plaintiffs argue that the words \u201cunless sooner terminated\u201d apply only to renewal periods subsequent to the expiration of the initial twelve-months term, but not to the initial term. That argument is born from the contemplation of the plaintiffs\u2019 frustrated hopes, not from any tenable legal foundation.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-11\">The well established principles guilding the construction of ambiguous contract provisions are of no help to plaintiffs in the light of the plain provisions of these contracts. An employment contract for a stated term, which is expressly terminable by either party upon notice, must be recognized as a valid contract and its provisions must be given effect. Cf., Repsold v. New York Life Ins. Co., 7 Cir., 216 F.2d 479, 486; Brown v. Federal Life Ins Co., 353 Ill. 541, 545, 187 N.E. 484.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-12\">It cannot be doubted as plaintiffs assert that they expected their employment to continue for at least one year, but that was merely an expectation and not a right guaranteed by the contracts which they signed. The courts cannot rewrite the contracts which they made. Clearly the phrase \u201cunless sooner terminated\u201d relates to the whole sentence of which that phrase is a part. The court below correctly construed each of these contracts as being terminable at will.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-13\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
