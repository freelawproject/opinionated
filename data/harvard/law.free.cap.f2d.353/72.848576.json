[Compare Federal Employers\u2019 Liability Act, 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 51.]</p>\n<p id=\"b123-18\">The jury found, on a directed verdict, that negligence on the part of appellant was a proximate cause of Sims\u2019 injuries, and appellant has satisfied the judgment entered on the jury\u2019s verdict. However, the District Court did not submit to the jury the issue raised by the third-party complaint as to whether appellant\u2019s neg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>ligence was the sole cause of Sims\u2019 damage, within the meaning of the provisions of the indemnity agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-4\">There is evidence in the record of communications, and other acts and omissions, of certain of City\u2019s agents, other than Sims, relative to completion of the icing operations; from which the jury might have found \u201cwith reason\u201d that negligence of the appellee at the time and place in question contributed in part as a proximate cause of the damage in controversy; and hence concluded that appellant\u2019s negligence was not the \u201csole cause\u201d. [See Rogers v. Missouri Pac. R. Co., 352 U.S. 500, 506, 77 S.Ct. 443, 1 L.Ed.2d 764 (1957).]</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">Any liability of appellee to appellant was, therefore, a question for the jury; and it was prejudicial error not to have submitted this question for the jury\u2019s determination. Accordingly, the judgment in favor of appellee on the third-party complaint must be reversed, and the cause remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">Reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
