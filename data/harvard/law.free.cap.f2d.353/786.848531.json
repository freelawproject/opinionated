After careful consideration of the record, we reject both contentions and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-24\">Although Appellant admits that \u201cthe general tenor of the testimony * * would arouse suspicion that the whiskey was tainted with illegality,\u201d he argues that nowhere was there express testimony that Federal tax stamps were not affixed to the containers of'the liquor. The Government certainly could have done a better job in eliciting specific testimony, but nevertheless the frequent references in the record to \u201cmoonshine liquor,\u201d \u201cillegal whiskey,\u201d and \u201cnon-tax paid liquor\u201d provided ample evidence, circumstantial and direct, for the jury to conclude that no stamps were affixed to the containers.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-25\"> Although only one count of the indictment charged conspiracy and the other seven counts charged separate offenses of possession and transportation, the jury found Appellant guilty \u201cof conspiracy on all eight counts.\u201d Applying the rule that the form of the general verdict is sufficient if it indicates the intention of the jury, 5 Wharton, Criminal Law \u00a7 2125, at 317-18 (Anderson ed. 1957), we regard the \u201cof conspiracy\u201d as surplusage and treat the verdict as a finding of guilty on each of the counts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"787\">*787</page-number>as charged. We do not believe the jury misunderstood its verdict. Nor did counsel for Appellant, otherwise he would have urged the Court to have the jury withdraw to correct the form of the verdict as the Judge had earlier stated would be done.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
