All three charges grew out of the May 9 shooting of one Emma Lee Hill. Appellant entered pleas of guilty to the first and third counts on July 27, 1961, and received concurrent sentences of 3 to 9 years and 1 year, respectively. Some seven months later Emma Lee Hill died as a result of wounds received in the shooting, and appellant was thereupon indicted for murder in the first degree. In October, 1962, he pleaded guilty to the lesser included offense of manslaughter and was later sentenced, by a different judge, to a 3 to 9 year term, to \u201ccommence upon the termination of the sentence he is now serving.\u201d Appellant thus faced imprisonment for a maximum period of 18 years for his attack on Emma Lee Hill. The maximum sentence for manslaughter permitted by local statute is 15 years. 22 D.C.Code \u00a7 2405.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-11\">No. 18583</p>\n<p id=\"b933-12\">This appeal is from the denial, after a hearing, of appellant\u2019s motion for correction of an illegal sentence under Rule 35, Fed.R.Crim.P. He contends that, because the two crimes of which he was convicted (assault with a dangerous weapon and manslaughter) \u201carose from but a single act on his part,\u201d the District Court was not authorized to sentence for consecutive terms. We agree with appellant\u2019s conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-13\"> In its recent decisions the Supreme Court has made increasingly clear that whether concededly distinct offenses growing out of the same act can be consecutively punished depends on the intention of Congress. See, <em>e. g., </em>Gore v. United States, 357 U.S. 386, 78 S.Ct. 1280, 2 L.Ed.2d 1405 (1958); Prince v. United States, 352 U.S. 322, 77 S.Ct. 403, 1 L.Ed.2d 370, 59 A.L.R.2d 940 (1957); Bell v. United States, 349 U.S. 81, 75 S.Ct. 620, 99 L.Ed. 905 (1955). The Court has also said that when the intention of Congress in this respect is unclear, its enactments should be construed leniently. See Prince v. United States, supra; Heflin v. United States, 358 U.S. 415, 79 S.Ct. 451, 3 L.Ed.2d 407 (1959). We have recently had occasion to apply these principles in another, though closely related, context. Ingram v. United States, 121 U.S.App.D.C. -, 353 F.2d 872, No. 18,568, (order vacating sentence and remanding for resentencing entered June 29, 1965, and opinion filed November 4, 1965). Our examination of the language and history of the two statutes involved in this case, \u00a7\u00a7 502 and 2405 of Title 22 of the D.C.Code, has proved inconclusive. For the reasons already so well explored by Judge Fahy in his opinion for the court in <em>Ingram, </em>therefore, we are constrained to hold that Congress did not intend to authorize consecutive punishments for aggravated assault and manslaughter in these circumstances, and that appellant\u2019s Rule 35 motion should have been granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-16\">Reaching this conclusion does not end our problem, however. The appropriate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"884\">*884</page-number>remedy in this situation would appear to be to vacate appellant\u2019s manslaughter sentence and remand his case to the District Court for resentencing, but neither appellant nor the United States urges us to follow that course. Appellant urges that we simply correct his manslaughter sentence (3 to 9 years) to run concurrently with his sentence (3 to 9 years) for assault with a dangerous weapon since, he contends, he cannot now be resentenced to a longer, <em>concurrent </em>term on the former charge and it is highly unlikely that the sentencing judge would sentence him to a shorter one. His premise is that he has already begun serving, at least for some purposes, the minimum (3 years) portion of his second sentence,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and that a sentence on which service has begun cannot lawfully be increased. See Tatum v. United States, 114 U.S.App.D.C. 49, 310 F.2d 854 (1962). The Government, on the other hand, disputes appellant\u2019s factual premise, arguing persuasively that, except for purposes of assessing appellant\u2019s eligibility for parole, he will not be deemed to have begun serving his manslaughter sentence until he has completed all 9 years of his first sentence for assault. The Government argues, instead, that even if appellant\u2019s contention that he cannot be consecutively sentenced be accepted, he is now serving what amounts to a 6 to 19 year sentence for an offense punishable by a maximum of 15 years. All we need do, it suggests, is reduce his present maximum term by 3 years in order to bring it within the maximum permitted by the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-12\"> In our view, we need not resolve the questions posed by appellant, but neither need we accept the recommendation pressed upon us by the United States.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Appellant's sentence for manslaughter was \u201cillegal,\u201d within the meaning of Rule 35, not, principally, because it exposed him to imprisonment for a term longer than the maximum provided for either offense, but because it in effect punished him twice (consecutively) for an act that Congress did not intend should receive double punishment. His second sentence, thus, was illegal because it was consecutive, and that illegality infects the sentence in its entirety. We held in Hayes v. United States, 102 U.S.App.D.C. 1, 249 F.2d 516 (1957), cert. denied, 356 U.S. 914, 78 S.Ct. 672, 2 L.Ed.2d 586 (1958), that a defendant who successfully attacks an invalid sentence can \u201cbe validly resentenced though the resentence increased the punishment.\u201d Tatum v. United States, <em>supra, </em>is not to the contrary, for there the court assumed that the appellant\u2019s original sentence was lawful.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b934-13\">Appellant\u2019s sentence for manslaughter is vacated, and this case is remanded to the District Court for re-sentencing only on the manslaughter count. That court may, in its discretion, impose any sentence within the statutory maximum of 15 years, to be computed from August 25, 1961, when appellant was first sentenced for assault with a dangerous weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-14\">No. 18923</p>\n<p id=\"b934-15\">Appellant also appeals from the District Court\u2019s denial, after sen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"885\">*885</page-number>tence and after a hearing, of his motion to withdraw his plea of guilty to the charge of assault with a dangerous weapon. He claimed that he was not informed, at the time he entered his plea, that he could subsequently be prosecuted for murder if Emma Lee Hill died within a year and a day of the shooting or that his plea could be used against him in such a prosecution. A motion to withdraw a plea of guilty is addressed to the discretion of the trial court, and, when it follows the imposition of sentence, requires a showing of \u201cmanifest injustice.\u201d Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(d). See Smith v. United States, 116 U.S.App.D.C. 404, 324 F.2d 436 (1963), cert. denied, 376 U.S. 957, 84 S.Ct. 978, 11 L.Ed.2d 975 (1964). On this record we cannot say that such a showing was made so convincingly that the District Court\u2019s denial of appellant\u2019s motion amounted to an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-5\">No. 18583 is reversed and remanded for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-6\">No. 18923 is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b934-4\">. Appellant\u2019s sentence for assault with a dangerous weapon commenced to run on August 25, 1961, the date of its imposition. Three years from this date had expired before the briefs were filed or arguments heard in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b934-5\">. On its face the Government\u2019s proposal would seem to entail a violation of the local indeterminate sentence statute, 24 D.C.Code \u00a7 203, which provides that the minimum portion of a sentence specifying the period after which the defendant will be eligible for parole shall not exceed \u201cone-third of the maximum sentence imposed.\u201d Moreover, it would require us to assume that the District Judge who imposed appellant\u2019s manslaughter sentence intended that he serve the maximum period provided for that offense.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b934-17\">. The rule accepted in that ease was articulated as follows: <em>\u201cIf appellant\u2019s first sentence was lawful </em>a second sentence could not lawfully be imposed which increased it or made it more severe, once he had commenced serving confinement under it.\u201d 114 U.S.App.D.C. at 50, 310 F.2d at 855 (Emphasis added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
