(21 U.S.C. \u00a7 174; 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 4704(a) and \u00a7 7237.) Appellant was convicted on three counts, and sentenced to five years, concurrently, on each. Appellant\u2019s codefendant, Garcia, entered a plea of guilty to one count.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-11\">Two errors are alleged: <em>first, </em>that the appellant\u2019s motion for new trial should have been granted because the government\u2019s case rested \u201clargely\u201d on the testimony of \u201can informer-accomplice\u201d; and <em>second, </em>that no actual or constructive possession of the heroin was established in the appealing defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-12\">Garcia was not an \u201cinformer,\u201d but an accomplice. The testimony of an accomplice does not require corroboration in the federal courts. Marcella v. United States, 285 F.2d 322 (9th Cir. 1960); Channel v. United States, 285 F.2d 217 (9th Cir. 1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b785-13\">Garcia\u2019s testimony was corroborated by agents Saiz and Briggs-. The court specifically refers to Saiz\u2019s corroborating testimony (R.T. 149), and his opinion of its worth and validity.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-14\">On a motion for new trial, particularly of a case tried before the court without a jury, the sound discretion of the trial judge is the only criterion involved. We cannot disturb his doubly reinforced opinion of guilt in an absence of clear proof of abuse of the trial court\u2019s-discretion. No such abuse here-exists.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-17\">It is impossible to understand appellant\u2019s claim that there was no proof of his possession of the heroin. Apparently this is urged because, says appellant\u2019s counsel, there was no testimony \u201cby a reliable witness.\u201d This is a matter of credence for the trier of fact to determine. The court did find as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b785-18\">\u201cFINDINGS OF FACT</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b785-19\">II</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b785-20\">That the defendant, accompanied by Garcia, drove his, the defendant\u2019s automobile to a house in Los Angeles, California, where the defendant, after first obtaining money from Garcia to purchase said narcotics, procured approximately 3.47 grams of heroin, a narcotic drug, contained in eight colored rubber balloons. That the defendant returned to the said automobile, <em>with said quantity of heroin in his possession and delivered the same to Garcia. </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b785-21\"><em>\u25a0x </em>* ' * *\u2022 * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b785-22\">V</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b785-23\">That the said quantity of heroin was not in the original stamped package, so purchased and sold by the defendant or from its original stamped package as required by the provisions of Section 4704, Title 26 of the United States Code.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b785-24\">VI</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b785-25\">That the defendant knowingly and unlawfully received, concealed, bought, sold and facilitated the concealment and transportation of said quantity of heroin and had the same in his possession in violation of Section 173, Title 21 of the United States Code. The defendant failed to explain such possession to the satisfaction of the trier of fact, and therefore it is found, based on statu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>tory presumption, that the defendant knew that said heroin was fraudulently and knowingly imported or brought into this country contrary to law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b786-4\">* * *\u201d (Clk\u2019sTr. 13)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b786-5\">These findings are supported by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
