His conviction was affirmed, Dirring v. United States, 1 Cir., 1964, 328 F.2d 512, cert. den. 377 U.S. 1003, 84 S.Ct. 1939, 12 L.Ed.2d 1052. In the district court he moved, pro se, for a new trial, for assignment of counsel, and for compulsory process to witnesses. The motions were denied, without hearing, United States v. Johnson, 1946, 327 U.S. 106, 66 S.Ct. 464, 90 L.Ed. 562, and he appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">Appellant\u2019s first ground for new trial is alleged violation of the Court Reporters Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 753, particularly the failure of the transcript to reproduce the arguments of counsel, some of which he wishes to criticize. No objection was m\u00e1de at trial as to this failure, nor upon the original appeal. Appellant was then represented by counsel. The objection comes too late. Fed.R.Crim.P. 33.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">Secondly, appellant alleges misconduct of the prosecuting attorney in coercing or suppressing evidence. Assuming that evidence of such misconduct coming to appellant\u2019s attention after trial would be \u201cnewly discovered evidence\u201d within the meaning of Fed.R.Crim.P. 33, appellant has failed to demonstrate that he has such evidence. Some of his allegations of coercion are reflected in the transcript of the trial, and are obviously not newly discovered. Correspondingly, the affidavits of the allegedly coerced witnesses, explaining their testimony, merely reoffer the explanation the jury has already considered. The remaining claims of coercion are either not supported by such relevant affidavits as appellant does submit, or are unsupported by any affidavits at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-7\">Appellant\u2019s third contention is that he can now produce witnesses previously unavailable. One of these is Gleason, who did not testify at the trial. Two are witnesses for whom subpoenas were allegedly outstanding prior to trial, but who could not be found. The remainder appear to be altogether new. All but Gleason allegedly would substantiate appellant\u2019s alibi, which the prosecution damaged heavily at the trial. However, appellant did not request a continuance of the trial for the purpose of further seeking the two witnesses then unsuccessfully subpoenaed, nor was the matter raised on appeal. Moreover, all he now offers is hearsay. This is insufficient. Kleinschmidt V. United States, D.Mass., 1956, 146 F.Supp. 253.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-9\">Appellant does submit an affidavit from Gleason which, if believed, would dissociate appellant from the crime altogether. This is the weakest sort of evidence, La Belle v. United States, 5 Cir., 1936, 86 F.2d 911, and the district court, which conducted the original trial, was certainly within its discretion in disbelieving it. Indeed, if a new trial could be predicated as of right upon a codefendant\u2019s change of heart after failure to take the stand there could always be a second chance for everyone.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-10\">With respect to appellant\u2019s demand for subpoenas, appellant must first make a prima facie showing. Particularly at this stage he cannot go on a fishing expedition on his own say-so.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-11\">There remains the question of whether the court erred in failing to appoint counsel to prosecute the motion for new trial. Appellant had counsel \u201cthrough appeal,\u201d as required by the Criminal Justice Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3006A (c). We do not construe that phrase to include motions for new trial. Nor do we so interpret the Sixth Amendment. There must be an end. Cf. United States v. Johnson, supra. After final conviction the appointment of counsel must rest in the discretion of the court. We see no abuse of discretion in this case. Cf. United States ex rel. Wissenfeld v. Wilkins, 2 Cir., 1960, 281 F.2d 707.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-12\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
