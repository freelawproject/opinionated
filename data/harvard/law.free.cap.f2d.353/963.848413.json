Through interrogatories and depositions, by way of discovery, and agreements to dismiss, the ease went to trial on November 29,1961, with only the Dow Chemical Company, Pennsylvania Paste Company, Samuel Schultz, Ada Schultz, Marvin Spiro and Isadore Kaplan, individually, and trading as Samuel Schultz &amp; Co., Reba Spivak, individually, and trading as Atlas Wallpaper &amp; Paint Co., and Sam-, uel Milkas, individually, and trading as Empire Wallpaper &amp; Paint Co. remaining as defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-4\">As adverted to above, after bringing into the sweep of the alleged conspiracy nineteen defendants, only two, the Pennsylvania Paste Co. and Schultz, whom the jury found guilty of the conspiracy count, are left, who are the appellants here. A verdict was rendered in favor of two of the defendants, the Dow Chemical Co. and Reba Spivak, individually, and trading as Atlas Wallpaper &amp; Paint Co., but, as indicated above, the defendants, Pennsylvania Paste Co. and Schultz were found guilty of violation of \u00a7 1 of the Sherman Act. All the defendants were acquitted of charges contained in \u00a7 2 of the Act after the court below had refused a motion for summary judgment and, at the close of the plaintiff\u2019s case, denied motions for judgment as to all the defendants, except Samuel Milkas, individually, and trading as Empire Wallpaper &amp; Paint Co., against whom no evidence had been offered, and, at the conclusion of all the evidence, the defendants submitted motions for a directed verdict which were likewise refused by the court. Accordingly, after trial and judgment, the court below vacated the judgment and granted judgment n. o. v., in accordance with Rule 50(b) of the Rules of Federal Procedure. Thus, this appeal concerns itself only with the defendants, Pennsylvania Paste Co. and Schultz.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-5\">It is requisite, in order to determine whether the defendant, Schultz, was a party to an alleged conspiracy with the Pennsylvania Paste Co. to preserve the dominance of the Pennsylvania Paste Co. in the wet paste industry in this area, by driving the plaintiff out of business, to critically examine a long, tedious and dreary record of nearly 6,000 pages and over 500 exhibits. In order to place in precise focus the factual matters on which the alleged offense is predicated, it is necessary to place in some chronological order the dates and the exact testimony of the witnesses involved, rather than resort to any generalization.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-7\">This case was one of the longest ever tried in the history of the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, and the court below, knowing the intricacy thereof and the complexity of the evidence to be submitted, finally, after many weeks of discovery through depositions and interrogatories, directed the plaintiff, in order to bring the matter into proper focus, to file a pretrial statement of the contentions he was going to present at the trial in order to clarify the precise issue posed by the plaintiff, as well as to apprise the defendants of the nature of the cause of action he was suing on. After several requests for extensions, the plaintiff, on December 30, 1959, filed a 17 page pretrial statement in which he set forth, in great detail, his contentions, and in so doing gave the history of the case from 1949 on down to the filing of the second amended statement of claim,' on December 31, 1959. (It is to be noted that while the second amended statement of claim was filed one day after the pretrial statement of December 30, 1959, the amended statement of claim was in the hands of all of the counsel for defendants on November 17, 1959, and it was never amended or changed in the slightest.) The pretrial statement or statement of contentions of the plaintiff, as he labeled it under the heading, \u201cb. The Legal Basis for the Claim Against Pa. Paste\u201d, on page 5 thereof, states: \u201cPlaintiffs\u2019 basic contention of law is that the Pennsylvania Paste Co. conspired with the other defendants to destroy the pl\u00e1intiffs\u2019 business and thereby preserve Pennsylvania Paste\u2019s dominant position in the wet paste manufacturing business in the Philadelphia area.\u201d This contention was referred to time and time again in the plaintiff\u2019s argument and in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"965\">*965</page-number>his brief as being the real core of the conspiracy <em>; </em>that it was the intention of the defendant, Pennsylvania Paste Co., in order to maintain its supremacy in the wet paste industry in the Philadelphia area, to drive the plaintiff out of business. In the pretrial statement, The Legal Basis for the Claim Against Pa. Paste covers nearly 4 pages, the contentions as to the Dow Chemical Co. cover 3 pages and the contention therein stated as to the retailers covers approximately 1 page, <em>y2 </em>of which is devoted to the retailers generally, all of whom were acquitted or dismissed by the court, and less than <em>y2 </em>page to the basis for the plaintiff\u2019s claim against the defendant, Schultz. Both charges against Schultz are short and, therefore, we quote the exact language, taking the second charge first, which is as follows: \u201cPlaintiffs also contend that, <em>pursuant to the conspiracy alleged, </em>the defendant, Samuel Schultz, induced United Wallpaper Co. to imitate and sell an imitation of plaintiffs\u2019 cellulose paste and, that after plaintiffs\u2019 product had been patented, he also discouraged a potential purchaser of the plaintiff\u2019s business from following through on the purchase by telling the prospective purchaser that anyone could manufacture the plaintiffs\u2019 products.\u201d (Italics ours.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-6\">The above occurred in the fall of 1951, and concerned itself with a product manufactured by Dovberg called \u201cCalico\u201d, a cellulose base wallpaper paste, a package of which was brought to the Schultz store at 2104 North Front Street, Philadelphia, and given to him as a sample, and Schultz replied that if, when he tested the same, it worked out as Dovberg said it would, he would be glad to take it to the United Wallpaper Co., a large concern, and see if he could get them interested on Dovberg\u2019s behalf. He further told Dovberg he would tell him what they thought of the product and if they liked it, they would not only manufacture it, but they would also license rights for it. Schultz promised to let him know about it and Dovberg said he was \u201cvery grateful and very much elated.\u201d However, Dovberg never again discussed this matter with either Schultz or any representative of his and the matter was dropped and there is nothing in the record to show whether the United Wallpaper Co. thought anything of the product or that they manufactured it. Therefore, it is obvious from the record that there is no warrant for this allegation against Schultz and it must be discarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-9\">The remaining and sole contention which must be relied upon by the plaintiffs is the second and last one wherein the pretrial statement reads as follows: \u201cPlaintiffs also contend that, at the instigation of the Pennsylvania Paste Co. <em>and pursuant to the conspiracy alleged, </em>the retail defendants sold the wall-size eliminator which they purchased from the Pennsylvania Paste Co. as being the same thing as Nix-size. Apart from its connection with a conspiracy to restrain trade, such an activity would be improper under the principles in the Restatement Torts \u00a7\u00a7 711 and-712(1), 741(b) and 743.\u201d (Italics ours.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-10\">The statement of claim filed September 25, 1958, makes it requisite, in the face of the four-year statute of limitations, that the actionable cause of the conspiracy concerns itself with the conduct of Schultz and the Pennsylvania Paste Company from September 25, 1954, to September 25, 1958.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-11\">The theory of the plaintiff is that the conspiracy had its origin in the conduct of the parties previous to 1954, and, more particularly, that there was a conspiracy to drive the plaintiff, Dovberg, out of business in order for the Pennsylvania Paste Company to maintain its dominant position in the wet paste industry which allegedly originated previous to 1954, and as hereafter adverted to.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-12\">Briefly, the facts, as regard Schultz\u2019s alleged participation in a conspiracy with the Pennsylvania Paste Company, concern a relatively small part of the record and we shall relate them. The Pennsylvania Paste Company held a dominant position in the manufacture of wet paste and had been so doing since 1892, and it controlled more than 50% of the wet <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"966\">*966</page-number>paste marketed in the Philadelphia area and, although it made dry paste, the manufacture of wet paste was much more profitable and it, accordingly, concentrated on it. The plaintiff, as early as 1949, was manufacturing a wall-size eliminator called Nix-size and in February, 1950, opened a small plant for the making of Nix-size and wet paste. The plaintiff marketed its wet paste in wooden tubs and sold the same in the Philadelphia area to its customers, some of whom formerly had been with the Pennsylvania Paste Company. The record discloses that many of these tubs were appropriated by the Pennsylvania Paste Company drivers and later, when the plaintiff changed its wet paste product to be marketed in fiber drums, these drums likewise mysteriously disappeared and, although the Pennsylvania Paste Company denied any participation therein, the plaintiff found, upon visiting the plant of the Pennsylvania Paste Company, that some of these containers were in their plant. Nevertheless, the record is devoid of any connection of Schultz with this conduct and, in fact, his name, was never mentioned in connection therewith as up to this time he had not begun to purchase wet paste from the plaintiff, Dovberg. However, Schultz, who had been doing business with the plaintiff as related since 1949 in other products such as Nix-size, began buying wet paste from the plaintiff on August 25, 1950, and continued up to October 28, 1950, when he discontinued buying from Dovberg, as he had purchased during this period the trivial amount of $32, although he maintained business with Dovberg buying his related products until March of 1952, when he discontinued purchasing Nix-size from him, which, as shall be adverted to later, has nothing whatsoever to do with the plaintiff\u2019s going out of the wet paste business. The testimony plainly shows that, although the plaintiff first testified he went out of the wet paste business in October, 1950, on later examination, he stated finally that he went out of the wet paste business in January, 1951, and he further testified that he so did because the Pennsylvania Paste Company was successful in driving him out of it and, in so stating, he never accused Schultz of any complicity whatever in his abandoning the wet paste business. He further testified that he never made wet paste thereafter, except on rare occasions and for a few special customers and, accordingly, he was, in no sense, in the wet paste business as to be competitive of the Pennsylvania Paste Company thereafter. As of January 1, 1951, it is apparent that the \u201cconspiracy alleged\u201d of both the Pennsylvania Paste Company and Schultz, in driving the plaintiff out of the wet paste business in order that the Pennsylvania Paste Company might maintain its dominance in the wet paste industry, died aborning, as Schultz was, on the record, in no wise connected therewith. While the record discloses that in a telephone conversation between the plaintiff, Dovberg, and Flanagan of the Pennsylvania Paste Company, on September 12,1950, Flanagan told the plaintiff, Dovberg, that he understood he was making wet paste and that he would \u201cdrop dead\u201d before he would lose one customer to him and that he was going to drive him out of business, that, here again, there is nothing in the record showing any connection whatsoever of Schultz with this statement of Flanagan or any conduct on the part of Schultz which could be construed as anything agreeing with the statement Flanagan made, as Schultz\u2019s name was not even mentioned in connection therewith. It is to be remembered that at the time this statement was allegedly made by Flanagan, Schultz had already stopped buying wet paste from the plaintiff, Dovberg, even though it was in exceedingly small amounts totaling, as adverted to before, some $32. On another occasion, late in 1951, Dovberg testified that Schultz called him and testified that Flanagan was \u201cgunning mad\u201d at him for purchasing his wet paste and Schultz advised him not to make wet paste for if he continued to make and sell it Flanagan was the type of fellow who could put him. out of business. It is to be remembered that this is flatly contradictory of Dovberg\u2019s pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"967\">*967</page-number>vious statement that the Pennsylvania Paste Company had successfully driven him out of business on January 1,1951, as well as the fact that Schultz had stopped purchasing wet paste from Dovberg on October 28, 1950. This is the only testimony that, in any wise,, connects Schultz with any knowledge of any relationship between the plaintiff, Dovberg, and the Pennsylvania Paste Company. However, it is also to be remembered that at the time of this conversation Schultz and Dovberg were on the most friendly terms and Schultz continued to do business with Dovberg for more than a year and a half thereafter. The record further discloses that Schultz stopped purchasing Dovberg\u2019s products on March 14, 1952, and the day before Schultz called Dovberg on the phone and told him the reason therefor that Flanagan of the Pennsylvania Paste Company was in to see him and left a sample of a product just like Nix-size and advised him, Schultz, that it had the same effect as Nix-size and that he would manufacture it for him under Schultz private label, since Schultz, a very large retailer, sold most of his products under his own label. He further advised plaintiff Dovberg, that he had a contract from the Pennsylvania Paste Company on his desk to buy the product and that he could sell it for much less than he could get Nix-size from Dovberg and by reason of these circumstances, when he had sold out his present inventory which he had purchased from him, Dovberg, he was not going to buy any more from him. Dovberg\u2019s reply to Schultz in this conversation was that he could not conceive of Flanagan selling a product similar to his at a lesser price unless he was putting into effect a threat he had made to him, Dovberg, to put him out of business and <em>\u201cif they did anything in joining an effort combined to hurt our business\u201d </em>that he would have to hold Schultz responsible therefor. (Italics ours.) However, on the very same day he wrote a letter to Schultz wherein he referred to this conversation, but made no mention whatsoever of a threat that had been made to him nor anything whatsoever about a joint effort to put him out of business. Furthermore, he closed the letter referring to their very good friendship and the friendly company that was Schultz, whom he \u201cyearns to do business with\u201d and with the hope that they would be able to serve him in the future. The only conclusion that could be drawn from the letter was one of a warm spirit of friendship and the regret that he was no longer to do business with him, Dovberg. If we draw the most favorable inference possible from the conversation and letter, it certainly does not comprise a conspiracy between defendant, Schultz, and defendant, Pennsylvania Paste Company, through Flanagan, concerning the wet paste business. For here again, it is to be remembered that this conversation in which defendant, Schultz, advised the plaintiff, Dovberg, that he was no longer going to buy Nix-size because it produced the same results as Nix-size did and because it was cheaper, was more than a year and a half after Schultz stopped purchasing wet paste from the plaintiff, Dovberg, and more than a year after Dovberg had gone out of the wet paste business for which he personally accused only the Pennsylvania Paste Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-6\">During the years 1954 to 1958, which constitute the actionable claim for conspiracy, the record is devoid of any conversations between the Pennsylvania Paste Company and the defendant, Schultz, concerning the plaintiff, Dovberg, from which anything like a conspiracy could be inferred and there was nothing in the conduct of the defendant, Schultz, other than his purchasing Magi-coat, similar in style and effect to Nix-size, but at a lesser price, wich was manufactured by the Pennsylvania Paste Company for Schultz under his private label, Magi-coat, and Schultz\u2019s failure to make any further purchases of anything whatsoever from Dovberg thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-7\">It is likewise significant that through hundreds of pages of testimony covering some nineteen witnesses over many days of trial, they concerned themselves solely with various customers complaining to plaintiff, Dovberg, that the Pennsylvania <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"968\">*968</page-number>Paste Company was selling Liqui-size, which it manufactured at a cheaper price than Nix-size and, in some instances, Flanagan again threatened to drive Dovberg out of business, but in this long record of testimony there is not a single instance in which any of these customers ever even hinted at Schultz\u2019s being involved with the Pennsylvania Paste Company in any conspiracy, nor, in fact, even mentioned Schultz\u2019s name in connection therewith.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-4\">It may well be that, on a better record, though questionably, a case of unfair competition might be made out against the Pennsylvania Paste Company for palming off their products, Liqui-size and Magi-coat, allegedly in imitation of the plaintiff\u2019s product, Nix-size. However, nothing in the testimony, it is submitted, gives rise to an actionable case of conspiracy against the plaintiff between the Pennsylvania Paste Company and Schultz.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-5\">A critical examination of this record shows, neither directly nor by circumstantial evidence, any conspiratorial conduct on the part of Schultz with the Pennsylvania Paste Company, to drive the plaintiff, Dovberg, out of business, in order to preserve the Pennsylvania Paste Company\u2019s dominant position in the wet paste industry. We reach this conclusion, using as the guide on appeal, that this court must consider the evidence in its strongest light in favor of the party against whom the motion is made and the appellant here, and giving him the advantage of every fair and reasonable intendment that the evidence can justify.

The plaintiffs, Ike and Maurice Dovberg, trading as Paste Company of America, were, until 1957, manufacturers of dry and cellulose based wallpaper paste and wall size eliminator. Pennsylvania manufactures wallpaper paste and related products, and Schultz, among other things, retails paste products. The named parties were engaged in business in the City of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, at the times relevant here. The plaintiffs\u2019 basic contention in their action is that Pennsylvania and Schultz conspired to destroy their business and thereby preserve Pennsyl<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"969\">*969</page-number>vania\u2019s dominant position in the wet paste manufacturing business in the Philadelphia area.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-5\">The case is now here because the trial court following its pre-trial denial of the defendants\u2019 motions for summary judgment, 195 F.Supp. 337 (E.D.Pa.1961), and its subsequent denial at the conclusion of the plaintiffs\u2019 testimony, of the defendants\u2019 motions for directed verdicts and dismissal,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> then granted the defendants\u2019 motions for judgment n. o. v.,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> or in the alternative for a new trial, following a jury\u2019s verdict of $22,000 in favor of the plaintiffs, and against both defendants, which verdict had been trebled by the trial court pursuant to the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-6\">The trial court premised its Order and Direction for Judgment n. o. v.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> on its determination (1) that \u201cno evidence has been adduced indicating any plausible or rational motive for Samuel Schultz &amp; Co. to have entered into a conspiracy * * * to force plaintiffs out of business\u201d; (2) \u201cno other probative evidence has been introduced linking Samuel Schultz &amp; Co. conspiratorily with Pennsylvania Paste\u201d; (3) \u201cPennsylvania Paste is legally unable to conspire with itself and therefore violate \u00a7 1 of the Sherman Act (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1)\u201d; and (4) \u201cThere has thus been total failure and lack of evidence to prove the essential elements of plaintiffs\u2019 case relating to guilt of Samuel Schultz &amp; Co.\u201d It premised its alternative granting of the defendants\u2019 motion for a new trial on its determination \u201cthat such substantial portions of the testimony of plaintiff Maurice Dovberg (on the stand over 6 weeks and over 4200 transcript pages) ranged from deliberative obfuscation to deliberate fabrication, and from fantasy to the bizarre, and that said testimony, on the whole, cannot be granted much credence, the Court thus concludes that the jury verdict is against the weight of the credible evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-7\">On this appeal the plaintiffs urge that the trial judge erred in granting the defendants\u2019 motions for judgment n. o. v. or in the alternative for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-8\">This dissent concerns only the judgment n. o. v. issue in view of the majority\u2019s disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-9\">In essence, the critical question it presents is whether the trial judge was right when he first denied the defendants\u2019 motions for a directed verdict at the conclusion of the plaintiffs\u2019 case on the ground that sufficient evidence had been presented by the plaintiffs to support their action if the jury credited it, or whether he was right when he found in granting judgment n. o. v. that the evidence was insufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-10\">The trial judge exhaustively reviewed ' the plaintiffs\u2019 evidence in the 75-page Opinion in which he denied the defendants\u2019 motions for a directed verdict at the conclusion of the plaintiffs\u2019 case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-11\">In that Opinion he said with respect to the plaintiffs\u2019 testimony in support of their allegation that \u201cPennsylvania Paste conspired with the other defendants to destroy plaintiffs\u2019 business * * * and thereby preserve Pennsylvania Paste\u2019s dominant position in the wet paste manufacturing business in the Philadelphia area. * * * \u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1019-13\">\u201cWhile the great bulk of it [plaintiffs\u2019 testimony] was hearsay, there does appear to be a modicum of direct testimony admitted <em>to raise a substantial issue of fact as to the truth of the allegation. * * </em>* Pennsylvania Paste\u2019s motion is denied. <em>A sufficient quantum of evidence has been adduced by plaintiffs to allow the case against this defendant to go to the jury. </em>Evidence has been adduced, for example, as to alleged statements of Mr. Flanagan, of Pennsylvania Paste\u2019s intent to force plaintiffs out of business;

Evidence has been adduced that Schultz knew of Pennsylvania Paste\u2019s illegal aim; that Schultz acted in furtherance of it by selling the wall size eliminator purchased from Pennsylvania Paste as being, or being the same thing as Nix-Size. <em>Of itself, such evidence is legally sufficient to allow the jury to rule on the allegations.\u201d </em>(emphasis supplied)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1020-7\">These well-settled principles must be applied in deciding whether the trial judge erred in granting the judgments n. o. v. under review, pursuant to Rule 50 (b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure :<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1020-8\">It is settled that Rule 50(b) has not withdrawn from juries their exclusive power to weigh evidence and determine contested issues of fact since a jury is \u201cthe constitutional tribunal provided for trying facts in courts of law.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The Rule presents <em>only </em>the question of law, as to whether, when all the evidence is considered, together with all reasonable inferences which may be drawn therefrom most favorable to the plaintiff, there is a total failure or lack of evidence to prove any necessary element of the plaintiff\u2019s case;<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> otherwise stated, the question is whether the evidence is sufficient to sustain the verdict. Where reasonably fair-minded men may differ as to the conclusions of fact to be drawn from the evidence, a jury is the proper tribunal to decide the issue.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1020-15\">It may be noted parenthetically that the issues were here submitted to the jury in a 39-page charge. That it was discriminating in its consideration of the testimony, is evidenced by the fact that after it had deliberated for over 24 hours before reaching its findings, it found in favor of the plaintiffs against the defendants Pennsylvania and Schultz only on the conspiracy count<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> of the charged Sherman Act violation, and in favor of Pennsylvania and Schultz on the monopoly count;<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> further, the jury found against the plaintiffs in favor of the defendant Dow Chemical Company, supplier of the principal ingredients of one of the plaintiffs\u2019 major products, and the defendant Atlas Wallpaper &amp; Paint Company, a retailer.</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-16\">It may further be stated that counsel had spent five days in summing up. The trial here was the longest in the history of the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. It began on November 28, 1961 and was concluded on March 29, 1962. The plaintiffs\u2019 principal witness, Maurice Dovberg, was examined on 35 days; his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"971\">*971</page-number>testimony alone covered more than 4300 pages. Eighteen other witnesses also testified for the plaintiffs over a period of five days; their testimony covered 700 pages. Some 426 exhibits were offered and admitted in the plaintiffs\u2019 case. The defendants\u2019 case took over 20 trial days, covering 1700 pages of testimony; their exhibits numbered 277.</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-5\">Stated in broad outline, the plaintiffs sought at the trial to establish that from 1950 through 1957 they manufactured and sold an additive for wallpaper paste and related products throughout the eastern part of the United States; that during that period Pennsylvania acted to destroy their business in order to preserve Pennsylvania\u2019s dominant position as a wet wallpaper paste manufacturer in the Philadelphia area, by manufacturing and selling below cost a wall size eliminator whose form, composition and packaging were a conscious imitation of the plaintiffs\u2019 wall size eliminator \u2014 \u201cNix-Size\u201d ;<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> that Schultz, the largest wallpaper and paint distributor in the Philadelphia area, who was the plaintiff\u2019s largest customer, conspired with Pennsylvania to destroy the plaintiffs\u2019 business by cutting off its purchase of the plaintiffs\u2019 product and purchasing Pennsylvania\u2019s imitation instead and marketing it as the plaintiffs\u2019 product or as identical to the plaintiffs\u2019 product.</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-6\">The plaintiffs\u2019 testimony adduced at the trial on the issue of conspiracy to violate the anti-trust laws, insofar as Pennsylvania is concerned, was as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-7\">Pennsylvania has been a manufacturer of wet and dry wallpaper paste since 1892. During 1950 through 1957 approximately 45 % of its total business was in wet wallpaper paste; it controlled 50% of the wet paste market in Philadelphia. Its sales of wet paste were more profitable than the sale of its other principal product, dry paste, since the former enjoyed a higher mark-up \u2014 90%. Its sales of wet paste declined steadily throughout 1950 to 1957.</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-11\">In 1949, the plaintiffs applied for a patent and began to sell its wall size eliminator \u201cNix-Size\u201d. In February of 1950 they purchased a factory in Philadelphia for the manufacture of \u201cNix-Size\u201d and wet paste. In the spring of 1950, D. J. Flanagan, president of Pennsylvania, visited plaintiffs\u2019 factory and learned of the use to which it was to be put. He obtained a sample of \u201cNix-Size\u201d, took it to a firm of consulting chemists and received from them a formula for a competitive product. Plaintiffs first marketed their wet paste in returnable wooden butter tubs which cost them 95 cents each. They charged a 35 cent deposit per tub to purchasers of the wet paste. They began to sell the wet paste to many of Pennsylvania\u2019s customers, and when they attempted to retrieve the tubs they rarely were successful. On September 12,1950, one of plaintiffs telephoned Flanagan complaining that retailers had reported that Pennsylvania\u2019s drivers were picking up the tubs and requested that they be stopped. Flanagan denied such activity. In September, 1950, plaintiffs bought fibre drums at a dollar each to market their wet paste. Although they were marked as their property they, too, were not returned. Again, Flanagan denied knowledge of their disappearance. In. the spring of 1951 one of the plaintiffs visited Pennsylvania\u2019s plant and found some of their wooden tubs and fibre drums there. Meanwhile, in December, 1950, Pennsylvania too marketed its wet paste in fibre drums similar to those of the plaintiffs. Although these drums held one and one-half quarts more paste than the wooden tubs, Pennsylvania didn\u2019t raise its price; the plaintiffs had to meet it and sell at a loss. By 1951, the plaintiffs were forced to stop large scale marketing of wet paste because of their losses, due to inability to raise prices and lost drums. When they did so Pennsylvania raised its prices. Plaintiffs, however, continued to market small quantities of wet paste and to advertise.</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"972\">*972</page-number>Plaintiffs\u2019 principal product was \u201cNix-Size\u201d, the wall size eliminator. At the time that it was first manufactured in quantity, there were no competitors. However, plaintiffs became aware of rumors to the effect that Flanagan had had \u201cNix-Size\u201d analyzed and that he was planning to market a similar product. In the earlier mentioned conversation of September 12th, one of the plaintiffs mentioned this to Flanagan. Flanagan replied that he understood that the plaintiffs were manufacturing wet paste in competition with Pennsylvania and said that \u201cif I lose one customer, I would sooner drop dead on the street-,\u201d and furthermore, so long as the plaintiffs continued to manufacture wet paste Pennsylvania would imitate any product they manufactured and could afford to out produce and undersell them even to the point of suffering losses, until they were put out of business. In October, 1950, Pennsylvania marketed a competing product, \u201cLiqui-Size\u201d. \u201cLiqui-Size\u201d had the same appearance as \u201cNix-Size\u201d; was packaged in the same quantities; contained. essentially the same ingredients; was merchandised as being identical to \u201cNix-Size\u201d and contained the same directions for use as \u201cNix-Size\u201d. In the spring of 1952, \u201cLiqui-Size\u201d was packaged in a bottle identical to that used for \u201cNix-Size\u201d. Although \u201cLiqui-Size\u201d was sold as essentially identical to \u201cNix-Size\u201d, a paperhanger, Mrs. Rosner,( testified that she had used both products and that \u201cLiqui-Size\u201d had proved unsatisfactory, relative to \u201cNix-Size\u201d, primarily because it took twice as much \u201cLiqui-Size\u201d to do the exact same job as \u201cNix-Size\u201d. Later, Dr. Obold, Chairman of the Department of Biochemistry at Drexel Institute of Technology, testified that it was his belief that if \u201cLiqui-Size?\u2019 performed as Mrs. Rosner had related, then this was an indication that it probably contained more water that \u201cNix-Size\u201d, and therefore would be possessed of less adhesive quality.</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-4\">On December 20, 1950 plaintiffs sent a registered letter, with return receipt to Flanagan, in which they accused Flanagan of perpetrating \u201cdiabolical acts calculated to drive them out of business, and requested that he please refrain from further applying these \u201cruthless tactics.\u201d Flanagan made no response to this letter. After the appearance of \u201cLiquiSize\u201d on the market, \u201cNix-Size\u201d sales fell off. Plaintiffs spoke with several of their customers and found that Flanagan had continued to merchandise \u201cLiqui-Size\u201d as identical to \u201cNix-Size\u201d but less expensive, and given favors and free merchandise to retailers. Prior to Pennsylvania\u2019s marketing of \u201cLiqui-Size\u201d plaintiffs had profitably sold their \u201cNix-Size\u201d for $4.20 a dozen and $48.00 per gross. \u201cLiqui-Size\u201d entered the market at $3.75 per dozen and on March 19, 1951 the price was reduced to $3.50 per dozen and $3.20 on gross purchases. The latter prices continued through 1952. Plaintiffs were required to meet Pennsylvania\u2019s pricing structure and to sell at a loss. In November 1953, Pennsylvania\u2019s prices fell to $3.00 a dozen, although costs of production had increased. Pennsylvania made a small profit in 1952 but suffered losses in 1953 and 1954. On September 12, 1952, plaintiffs sent a second letter to Flanagan accusing Pennsylvania of attempting to confuse potential customers by packaging \u201cLiqui-Size\u201d in a bottle which was identical to the bottle in which \u201cNix-Size\u201d was sold, and of subjecting the plaintiffs to a staggering and unfair competitive burden. This letter was likewise unanswered. A final letter was sent to Flanagan on March 11, 1955 in which plaintiffs beseeched him to put an end to imitation of the plaintiffs\u2019 products. As before, no answer was forthcoming.</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-6\">Plaintiffs\u2019 losses on their sales of \u201cNix-Size\u201d after 1950 depleted their capital and their business was gradually throttled. By 1956 they could no longer fill their orders and this was an important factor in the eventual destruction of their entire business.</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-7\">Plaintiffs presented the following testimony with respect to the alleged participation of Schultz in the conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-8\">Schultz operated the largest chain of wallpaper and paint stores in the Phila<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"973\">*973</page-number>delphia and Camden areas. It was one of the plaintiffs\u2019 best customers and it knew it. Schultz tested the plaintiffs\u2019 \u201cNix-Size\u201d in September, 1949 and it then purchased it in increasing quantities for some time. By 1950 Schultz was selling \u201cNix-Size\u201d in every one of its stores. At that time it also began purchasing the plaintiffs\u2019 wet paste. It discontinued purchases of the wet paste on October 28, 1950. It continued its purchases of \u201cNix-Size\u201d until March 1952. At that time Schultz telephoned the plaintiffs that it had been given a sample of Pennsylvania\u2019s \u201cLiqui-Size\u201d and had been assured by Flanagan that \u201cit was just like \u2018Nix-Size\u2019 \u201d; that Flanagan had given it permission to sell the product under Schultz\u2019 private label of \u201cMagicoat Liquid Size\u201d, at a price lower than the price of \u201cNix-Size\u201d; that Schultz would no longer buy \u201cNix-Size\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-5\">Earlier, in November, 1951, Schultz told the plaintiffs that Flanagan was \u201cgunning mad\u201d because it had been purchasing the plaintiffs\u2019 wet paste and that \u201cif you fellows continue to sell wet paste, this fellow could put you out of business. He is just the fellow who can do it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-6\">It was testified that individuals who attempted to purchase \u201cNix-Size\u201d at various Schultz stores were invariably told \u201cWe don\u2019t have \u2018Nix-Size\u2019 in stock. We sell \u2018Magicoat\u2019, it is the same thing,\u201d or that \u201cMagicoat\u201d was in fact \u201cNix-Size\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-7\">Plaintiffs also testified that Schultz at one time repackaged \u201cNix-Size\u201d under its own label and that at another time it sold \u201cNix-Size\u201d at sharp discount, \u201cat the instigation of Pennsylvania.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-8\">Spiro, a Schultz partner, testified that \u201cNix-Size\u201d was more salable than Pennsylvania\u2019s \u201cLiqui-Size\u201d, and Schultz\u2019 privately-labeled \u201cMagicoat\u201d, and that Schultz\u2019 mark-up on its private brand was less than the difference between the cost and the fair trade price of \u201cNix-Size\u201d. Thus, Schultz actually sacrificed potential profits when it sold Pennsylvania\u2019s product and its own, instead of the plaintiffs\u2019 \u201cNix-Size\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-9\">In defense, Flanagan denied Pennsylvania ever had any intention to put the plaintiffs out of business, or having any motive for doing so, or that he ever made a statement that he would do so, and Schultz denied entering into any conspiracy with Pennsylvania with respect to the plaintiffs, and contended that its business with the plaintiffs was insignificant, as was its sales of wallpaper paste.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-10\">The trial judge in his charge to the jury correctly submitted to it in sharp and precise focus the issues it was to resolve.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-11\">He said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1023-12\">\u201cA conspiracy under the Anti-Trust Acts is an understanding with respect to engaging in a course of conduct the result of which is to restrain trade. One defendant alone cannot be guilty of being a conspirator. A conspiracy must contain two or more persons or corporations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1023-13\">\u201cOne need not trade with anyone with whom he does not wish to trade. One need not trade with anyone or everyone who wishes to do business with him. One need not compete in a half-hearted or constrained manner. But there are limitations on one\u2019s business activity. One may not make a decision not to do business with another as a result of a conspiracy to drive the other party out of business. One may not compete against him in various ways (to be detailed throughout this charge), as a result of or after having joined a conspiracy the purpose of which is to drive the competitor out of business.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1023-14\"><em>\u201cThe crucial question in this case is: did two or more of the defendants combine, conspire or agree to do various acts, such as not selling to the plaintiff on credit, not buying from the plaintiffs, and not competing fairly with the plaintiffs for the purpose of driving the plaintiffs out of business </em>* * *. <em>Did the defendant Samuel Schultz and Company and the defendant Atlas Wall</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"974\">*974</page-number><em>paper &amp; Paint Company cease purchasing and selling the plaintiffs\u2019 products as a result of a business decision on their part or to assist Pennsylvania Paste Company in driving plaintiffs out of business? Did the defendant Pennsylvania Paste Company act towards the plaintiffs as it did, (their actions, of course, to be determined by you), as a result of independent business judgment on its part or as a result of an agreement, combination or conspiracy, or while inviting others to assist it in acting in destroying the plaintiffs\u2019 business?\u201d </em>(emphasis supplied) ,</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AY8\">The trial judge gave further required instructions relating to tests to be applied by the jury in answering the posed questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-4\">He specifically charged that while conspiracy may be proved by circumstantial or inferential evidence alone</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1024-5\">\u201c * * * it is necessary not only that the circumstances proven by the evidence shall reasonably give rise to an inference of conspiracy, but also that no other equally reasonable inference can be drawn from the same circumstances. If <em>two equally reasonable inferences can be drawn from the circumstances proved by the evidence, one consistent with the evidence of conspiracy and the other inconsistent, you should not infer the existence of conspiracy from such evidence alone.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1024-6\">He also charged that the evidence must show (1) that someone \u201chas embarked on an unlawful course of action with which cooperation is invited, and (2) that the defendant, or any other person who is claimed to have been a conspirator, <em>knowingly and willfully participated </em>in the accomplishment of that plan with the intent to advance or further some object or purpose of the plan.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-7\">On review of the record I am of the opinion that the trial judge was right when, in denying the defendants\u2019 motions for a directed verdict at the close of the plaintiffs\u2019 case, he said \u201csufficient factual questions have been presented to allow the jury to rule on the issues\u201d with respect to the case against Pennsylvania, and that \u201csubstantial evidence has been introduced\u201d with respect to Schultz\u2019 participation in a conspiracy, and that he was wrong when, in his \u201cOrder and Direction for Judgment n. o. v.\u201d he stated \u201cthere is a total failure and lack of evidence to prove the essential elements of plaintiffs\u2019 case relating to guilt of Samuel Schultz &amp; Co.\u201d and that, accordingly the jury\u2019s verdict cannot stand against Pennsylvania because \u201cPennsylvania is legally unable to conspire with itself and thereby violate \u00a7 1 of the Sherman Act [15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1.].\u201d On the score of the latter finding it must be observed that the trial judge has not found that the evidence was insufficient to sustain the jury's implicit finding that Pennsylvania acted to destroy the plaintiff\u2019s business.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-9\">It can be said of the evidence here that reasonably fair-minded men may differ as to the conclusions to be drawn from it. That being so, under settled law it remains in such a situation for the jury to select the conclusion it deems proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-10\">As was said in Myers v. Reading Co., 331 U.S. 477, pp. 485-486, 67 S.Ct. 1334, p. 1339, 91 L.Ed. 1615 (1947) :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1024-11\">\u201c * * * where, as here, there is an evidentiary basis for the jury\u2019s verdict, the jury is free to discard or disbelieve whatever facts are inconsistent with its conclusion. And the appellate court\u2019s function is exhausted when that evidentiary basis becomes apparent, it being immaterial that the court might draw a contrary inference or feel that another conclusion is more reasonable.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1024-12\">That there was here evidence to sustain the jury\u2019s finding that Schultz conspired with Pennsylvania to drive the plaintiffs out of business, was expressly found by the trial judge, in his opinion denying the defendants\u2019 motion for a directed verdict at the conclusion of the plaintiffs\u2019 testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-13\">In that opinion the trial judge said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1024-14\">\u201cSchultz is charged with \u2018discontinuing and refusing to resume * * * <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"975\">*975</page-number>[his] purchases of wall size eliminator\u2019 from plaintiffs, \u2018with knowledge of Pennsylvania Paste\u2019s intent\u2019 to drive the plaintiffs out of business.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1025-5\">\u201cEvidence has been introduced of Schultz\u2019 discontinuance of purchases from plaintiffs and his refusal to resume purchases.

The plaintiff Maurice .Dovberg testified that on March IS, 1952 a Schultz partner, Samuel Schultz, called him on the phone and \u201ctold me that Mr. Flanagan of the Pennsylvania Paste Company was in to see him and left him a sample of a product just like Nix-Size. In fact, he assured me, he said \u2018It is exactly the same as your Nix-Size. This is a sample of what he is going to manufacture for me under our private label.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-9\">\u201cHe also told me that he had a contract, an agreement, that he had on his desk to sign, and when he signed that agreement, that in effect, he would stop buying Nix-Size, and after he consumed, sold out, his present inventory, he wouldn\u2019t buy from us again. He said he tried Pennsylvania\u2019s Nix-Size \u2014 that\u2019s how he referred to it\u2014 \u2018and I found it to be exactly the same as yours, and Mr. Flanagan is going to sell it to me for much less than what I can get it from you.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-10\">\u201cAt this point I advised Sam Schultz that we had patents pending, that we hadn\u2019t licensed anyone to manufacture any</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-15\">imitation or similar product as ours, especially where such products would serve the same general principles, and I told Sam Schultz that I can\u2019t conceive that Mr. Flanagan would be able to sell him an imitation of our Nix-Size in exactly the same form, the same product, at a lesser price, unless he was enforcing the threat that he had made to me that he would produce the same product, sell it for less or below the cost I could afford to sell ours, in an effort to put us out of business; and I told Sam Schultz that if he sold Mr. Flanagan\u2019s manufactured product under his exclusive label, and if they did anything in joining an effort, combined, to hurt our business, that I would have to hold Mr. Schultz as responsible as I would the Pennsylvania Paste Company if they damaged our business.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-16\">\u201cQ.

Well, he laughed and he said, \u2018It was nice doing business with you, Kid,\u2019 and that terminated the conversation.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
