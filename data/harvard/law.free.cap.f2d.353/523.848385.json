Winter, 348 F.2d 204, 207-08, 210-11 (2d Cir. 1965), which presented exactly the same fact pattern as is presented by the instant case. These arguments were properly rejected in that case and need not be discussed again here.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-4\">Appellant was originally indicted on four counts; he initiated the effort.and made the motion to limit the jury\u2019s deliberation to one count. The count placed before the jury charged Rosen with having falsely answered the following question;</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-5\">\u201cHave you had occasion to accept any gratuities from, not only any builder, but any construction representative of a builder, such as his construction superintendent or anyone else?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">It is true that the question is inarticulately phrased. But, when taken in the context of the entire grand jury proceeding, it is not so vague and indefinite as to misinform the defendant about the nature of the charge against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-7\">Rosen was quite aware of the meaning of the term \u201cgratuities.\u201d Before answering the question of which he now complains, he was asked to define \u201cgratuities\u201d and answered \u201ca gift of any kind.\u201d Appellant denied that he had received any money from anyone engaged in the building of houses. He denied the receipt of \u201cany gratuity,\u201d including liquor, after 1957. At the trial one builder after another testified that appellant had accepted gratuities during a period commencing in 1959. Given his protracted testimony before the grand jury and the evidence presented at trial it is inconceivable that either appellant or the jury could have been mistaken about the nature and content of the charge against him. In this context \u201cHave you had occasion to accept\u201d clearly meant \u201cHave you on any occasion accepted any gratuities.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b574-8\">There is no merit in any of appellant\u2019s other arguments. Rosen\u2019s allegations that the prosecutor engaged in varying types of \u201cmisconduct\u201d are not supported by the record. Grand jury minutes may properly be used to refresh a witness\u2019 memory. Upon the request of appellant, Judge Bruchhausen inspected the grand jury testimony of one witness ; he properly declined to turn over the minutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-10\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
