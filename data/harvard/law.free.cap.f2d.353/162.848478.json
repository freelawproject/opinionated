In refusing petitioner an individualized investigation of its rates, it determined that comprehensive investigation was preferable to \u201cpiece-meal\u201d inquiry. It concluded that under the Act its primary function was to promote the paramount interest of the consuming public by establishing rate stability in this producing area.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-20\">The sole issue raised is whether there was substantial evidence before the Commission to support its findings and order. A careful examination of the record convinces us that the Commission acted properly and within a permissive area of administrative conduct wherein it reasonably exercised its discretion upon substantial and sufficient basis in fact and law. Superior Oil Co. v. Federal Power Commission, 322 F.2d 601 (9 Cir. 1963),* cert. den. 377 U.S. 922, 84 S.Ct. 1219, 12 L.Ed.2d 215 (1964), rehearing den. 377 U.S. 960, 84 S.Ct. 1625, 12 L.Ed. 2d 504 (1964); Wisconsin v. Federal Power Commission, 373 U.S. 294, 83 S.Ct. 1266, 10 L.Ed.2d 357 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b212-21\">The order of the Federal Power Commission under review will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
