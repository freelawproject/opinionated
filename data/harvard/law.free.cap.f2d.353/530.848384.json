Norton\u2019s reliability was established by his having given agents of the narcotics bureau detailed information about several narcotics violators and their activities, which information was accurate to the personal knowledge of the agents.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-16\">Norton also provided the agents with precise information as to where appellant could be found, his mode of living, etc., all of which checked out. In these circumstances, the agents were justified in assuming that Norton\u2019s information about appellant\u2019s connection with narcotics was also correct. There was probable cause for the arrest. See United States v. Smith, 308 F.2d 657, 662-663 (2d Cir. 1962), cert. denied, 372 U.S. 906, 83 S.Ct. 717, 9 L.Ed.2d 716 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"AaE5\">Moreover appellant, apparently under the mistaken belief that there were no narcotics in his car, himself first suggested to the agents that they search the car. It would be hard to find clearer evidence of voluntary consent. See United States v. Dornblut, 261 F.2d 949 (2d Cir. 1958), cert. denied, 360 U.S. 912, 79 S.Ct. 1298, 3 L.Ed.2d 1262 (1959).</p>\n<p id=\"b581-19\">The Court wishes to express to William D. Popkin, Esq., its gratitude for his conscientious and able handling of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-20\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b581-21\">KAUFMAN, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"AqF\">(concurring) :</p>\n<p id=\"b581-22\">The Court properly affirms appellant\u2019s conviction for violating 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 173, 174 (1958). The officers who arrested Simpson acted with probable cause. They adequately established the reliability of the informer\u2019s statement by personally verifying its details. United States v. Monticallos, 349 F.2d 80 (2d Cir. 1965). Thus, as an incident to a lawful arrest, the search of Simpson\u2019s car was permissible. Bartlett v. United States, 232 F.2d 135 (5th Cir. 1956); cf. Crawford v. Bannan, 336 F.2d 505 (6th Cir. 1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b581-23\">I would base the affirmance on this ground and see no need to pass upon whether Simpson voluntarily consented to the search of his automobile.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
