We did so because there was \u201cno indication here that the court * * * made use of any of the aids to sentencing placed at its disposal by the Congress of the United States.\u201d It also appeared that appellant\u2019s request for a mental examination before sentence might not have been considered. Leach v. United States, 115 U.S.App.D.C. 351, 354, 320 F.2d 670, 673 (1963). On remand, and without further investigation, the District Court Reinstated the original sentence. United States v. Leach, 218 F.Supp. 271 (D.D.C. 1963). On the second appeal which followed, we again remanded, this time with specific directions to the District Court \u201cto grant the defendant\u2019s request for a mental examination before re-sentencing.\u201d Leach v. United States, 118 U.S.App.D.C. 197, 203, 334 F.2d 945, 951 (1964). On that remand, after various reports were obtained, the court conducted a hearing oh sentencing, 231 F.Supp. 544, and again imposed the original sentence. The case is now before us for the third time.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-18\"> In imposing a statutorily permissible sentence, a sentencing judge has a wide discretion which will not ordinarily be disturbed on appeal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> 2But the scope of our review of the process by which the sentence is determined is at least broad enough to insure the use of necessary sentencing aids to obtain relevant information.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> For this task, the material obtained and considered by the judge may be required.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Hence we ordered <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and received a supplemental record containing certain reports and information, earlier referred to by the judge <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> **but not previously furnished to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-19\"> Based upon the entire record now before us, the following appears. On the last remand, the District Court ordered appellant committed to Saint Elizabeths Hospital for examination and a re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>port on the defendant\u2019s present mental condition and prognosis \u201cso that the Court may, on the basis of'this report and other sources, sentence the defendant.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Instead of responding with information for that purpose, the Hospital Superintendent addressed himself to a question that was not raised and was irrelevant to the court\u2019s inquiry. His response was directed to the defendant\u2019s competency to be sentenced and was not even informative for that question since his report consisted only of the usual boiler-plate that \u201cas a result of our examinations and observations it is our opinion that William H. Leach is mentally competent for sentencing.\u201d <footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b503-4\">Appellant was also referred to the Legal Psychiatric Services which reported that \u201cMr. Leach was very suspicious, evasive, and refused to cooperate in the examination, stating that he didn\u2019t see anything in it for him. Consequently, I can form no opinion of his mental status.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">Another report was obtained from the Chief Clinical Psychologist of the Psychologieal Services Center of the Department of Corrections. Appellant\u2019s background was briefly discussed, the conclusions derived from various tests were presented, and reports of those familiar with appellant were set out. It was reported that Leach \u201cappears to be a fairly able clerical worker\u201d and that \u201chis unit supervisor reports that he has done an outstanding job in that he has been reliable, conscientious and efficient in the performance of his duties. * * * On the basis of my knowledge and contact with Mr. Leach, it is my opinion that he is of sound mind and is not suffering from any severe mental illness. As far as I know, he has maintained a good disciplinary record and gets along well with the staff and inmate population.\u201d <footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b503-12\">While the report from the Department of Corrections does contain some relevant information, none of the three reports provides the kind and amount of detailed information which would enable the sentencing judge to make an informed selection of the disposition that would best serve the interests of the defendant and society.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>Among other things, the judge needs to know whether the defendant is suffering from any physical, intellectual or emotional disabilities-; if so, how this may affect his behavior; what treatment is indicated; the likelihood of a successful societal adjustment without such treatment; and the effect of various sentences on the defendant\u2019s condition, on his chances for rehabilitation, and on his future interaction with society.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b504-4\">Notwithstanding the plainly unsatisfactory nature of these reports, there are circumstances which militate against pursuing the matter further. Counsel on appeal did not challenge the adequacy of the reports,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> because, as he stated at oral argument, his client was \u201cquite hostile\u201d to any further psychiatric examinations. While the defendant\u2019s wishes in these matters are not binding upon us, we share his sense of frustration with these proceedings. In light of the foregoing, and the defendant\u2019s refusal to cooperate in any further investigations, we think it would be unfair to the defendant, and perhaps a futile exercise, to remand this case and subject him to further examinations. Therefore, we are constrained to follow his wishes.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">BASTIAN, Senior Circuit Judge, concurs in the result.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b502-8\">.
