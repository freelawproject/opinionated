In view of the dilatory and contumacious conduct of plaintiffs and their counsel in virtual defiance of the rules and orders of at least six judges in the district court, the sanction of dismissal was reasonable and correct. Nasser v. Isthmian Lines, 381 F.2d 124 (2 Cir. 1964); Parker v. Broadcast Music, Inc., 289 F.2d 313 (2 Cir. 1961). Moreover, there is no merit whatsoever in appellants\u2019 claim, ostensibly made under Rule 60(b) (1), Fed.R.Civ.P., that they did not receive proper notice of the trial court\u2019s order of April 6, 1965 requiring them to answer certain interrogatories within five (5) days; as Chief Judge Ryan observed in his May 4 order, the record establishes that notice of the April 6 order was timely mailed to counsel by the clerk\u2019s office and was also provided by publication in the New York Law Journal on April 8, 1965.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-25\">The order appealed from is affirmed with costs to appellees.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
