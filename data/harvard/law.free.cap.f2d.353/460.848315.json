The warrant arose out of an indictment charging appellant with an eighty-five-dollar burglary of Peewee\u2019s Garage in Moss Point, Mississippi. In his <em>habeas corpus </em>application appellant denied that he was in Mississippi on March 14, 1963, the date of the alleged crime, and asserted that, therefore, he could not be a fugitive from that state on this charge. In remanding we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ANz\">\u201cThe presence of the demanding state\u2019s indictment alone, however, is not necessarily conclusive evidence of fugitivity. It raises a presumption of fugitivity which will not be disturbed except <em>on clear and convincing proof </em>to the contrary. Lee Won Sing v. Cottone, 74 App.D.C. 374, 123 F.2d 169 (1941). But the presumption may be overcome. See Richards v. Matthews, 93 U.S.App. D.C. 70, 207 F.2d 227 (1953).\u201d Moncrief v. Anderson, 119 U.S.App.D.C. 323, 325, 342 F.2d 902, 904 (1964). (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b511-9\">In the hearing on remand, the State of Mississippi rested solely on the formar extradition papers, which included a certified copy of the indictment. Appellant testified that he had left Mississippi in the early part of March, 1963, and arrived in Washington after a two-day drive by automobile. Here he found work, and he produced as a witness the person who employed him. This witness, however, while testifying that he did employ appellant in March, 1963, was unable to provide the exact date on which that employment began. Appellant also produced two witnesses who testified that they saw him in Washington in March, 1963, on the day one Reese, appellant\u2019s roommate in Washington, came out of the hospital. The witnesses were uncertain as to the exact date, but hospital records were introduced which proved that Reese was released from the hospital here on March 14, 1963.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-19\">At the close of the hearing on remand, the trial court, after stating that the fact question presented was \u201cclose\u201d and \u201cdifficult,\u201d nevertheless found that the presumption of fugitivity created by the Mississippi indictment had not been overcome by clear and convincing evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-20\">It is true appellant\u2019s proof of his presence in Washington on March 14, 1963, was not supported by any formal records other than those from the hospital. It is true, too, that the witnesses, including appellant himself, were not as definite as they might have been as to the precise dates of events which occurred almost two years prior to their testimony. But the very fact that the testimony was not sharp and precise lends credibility. In fact, in these circumstances it would have been quite remarkable had the testimony been otherwise. Appellant\u2019s witnesses obviously do not operate from desk calendars or date books, so the fact that they were relegated to fixing dates of events by reference to other events is completely understandable.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-21\">Appellant\u2019s proof, while not beyond a reasonable doubt, was clear and convincing enough, to me at least, to require the State of Mississippi to come forward with some proof of its own.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> ******This has been the practice in <em>habeas corpus </em>cases in the District of Columbia where a party resisting extradition has offered substantial evidence that he was not in the demanding state at the time the crime was alleged to have been committed.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>I see no reason why this practice was not followed here. Moss Point, Mississippi, is perhaps a thousand miles from Washington. Transporting an indigent defendant that distance away from his witnesses to a possibly hostile atmosphere on an eighty-five-dollar burglary charge is not, in my judgment, an action to be taken lightly.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-4\">I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b511-10\">. \u201cThis court [has] ruled, in Hayes v.
