Miller, as receiver. At that time it was a creditor of the Franklin Paper Company, an Ohio corporation, in the sum of $53,602.87, and was also a stockholder in said company to the amount of $5,650, and had prior to that time held other stock it had disposed of, amounting to $5,650. On the 7th of July, 1896, the paper company having become insolvent, Walter B. Schaeffer, a creditor, brought suit in the court of common pleas of Warren county, Ohio, against the bank and all other stockholders of the paper company to enforce the statutory liability, under section 3260 of the Revised Statutes of Ohio of 1892, providing for the double liability of stockholders, in which suit judgment was rendered against all of the stockholders of the paper company. There was a judgment against the bank for $2,361.13 on a liability of $5,650 on the stock which it had sold, which judgment was for the benefit of only 11 creditors, not including the bank; and there was another judgment against the bank for $5,650 on the stock still held by the bank, which was for the benefit of all the creditors of the paper company, including the bank. Dividends aggregat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>ing 70 per cent, have been declared by the Comptroller of the Currency, to be paid by the receiver out of the assets of the bank. The estimated dividend from the fund in the hands of the complainant is 5 per cent. Because the receiver claims the right to set off the dividends due the creditors of the paper company on the judgment of $5,050, in which it is a beneficiary, against the dividends which will come to him on the claim of $53,602.87 out of the fund being collected by the receiver of the paper company, this suit has been brought to compel him to issue a certificate for the full amount of the dividends, without reference to the anticipated dividend he may receive. On final hearing the court below decreed that the defendant receiver issue to the complainant a certificate for the sum of $2,361.13, the amount of the judgment which was obtained for the benefit of only 11 creditors of the paper company, not including the bank, and pay the complainant on that certificate the dividends theretofore declared and thereafter to be declared, and paid to the creditors of the bank; that the defendant also issue to the complainant a certificate for the sum of $5,650, the amount of the judgment rendered against the bank, in which the bank was interested to the amount of the dividends it should receive on its claim against the paper company; that the defendant pay to the complainant on the last-named certificate dividends to an amount which, together with the dividend to be paid by the complainant to the defendant, shall equal the amount of the dividends theretofore declared and thereafter to be declared and paid to the creditors of the bank, including the complainant, on the judgment of $5,650; and that the cause be retained until the exact amount of dividend to be paid by the complainant has been determined, and for such further orders as may be necessary. From this decree the receiver for the paper company appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b241-4\">George A.

If the bank\u2019s claim against this fund was held by some other person, then the fund could only receive the full amount of the dividends declared by the Comptroller of the Currency, and would be obliged to pay on this claim the full amount of the dividend that should be paid to the beneficiaries of the fund. If no dividend is paid to the bank receiver out of this fund, the bank, as a credit- or, and its creditors will receive a less amount than the other creditors of this fund. There seems to be no way of making an equitable distribution of the two funds except to offset one dividend against the other. Insolvency is a recognized ground on which a court of equity will compel a set-off. Waterman\u2019s Set-Off, \u00a7\u00a7 431-441, and cases there cited. In applying the doctrine that equity is equality, it seems to us that the court below made the only equitable disposition of the case possible. The bank could not pay the claims against it in full; neither can the fund in the hands of the complainant; and the beneficiaries of the two funds can be placed on an equality only by offsetting the dividends due from each. The debtor to either fund, if solvent, could pay in full, and as a creditor of the fund would be entitled to share in it only after full payment; but the equities of two insolvent funds or estates, where the beneficiary of one fund is a debtor to the same fund, can only be adjusted for the benefit of all the beneficiaries of the two funds by the setting off of one dividend against the other. In Markell v. Ray, 75 Minn. 138, 77 N. W. 788, the precise point involved here was decided, and the dividends were set off. Any other rule would work injustice.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">The decree must be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
