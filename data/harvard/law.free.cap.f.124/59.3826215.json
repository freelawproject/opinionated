The collector assessed that portion of the merchandise valued above 4 cents per pound,, under paragraph 124 of the act of 1894 (Act Aug. 27, 1894, c. 349, \u00a7 1, Schedule C, 28 Stat. p. 517), which provides, inter alia, for an ad. valorem duty of 40 per centum upon \u201csheet steel in strips.\u201d The importer protested, insisting that it should have been assessed under section 1, Schedule C, par. 122 (28 Stat. 5x6), which provides for \u201csteel-in all forms and shapes not specially provided for in this act.\u201d The board of appraisers sustained the action of the collector. Testimony was taken on behalf of the importer in the Circuit Court, which subsequently affirmed the decision of the board. The importer thereupon appealed to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-9\">The importer admits that the merchandise in question is steel, and that it is in strips, but he denies that it is sheet steel. This is, therefore, the only controversy. If the merchandise be sheet steel, it is conceded that the action of the collector was correct; if not sheet steel, his assessment should be overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-10\">The board finds that the steel in. question is cold-rolled steel in strips, valued above 4 cents a pound, varying in width from less than 1 inch to not exceeding 6 inches, and is mostly in coils exceeding 100 feet in length and varying in thickness from No. 10 wire gauge to No. 36, and possibly in some instances thinner than No. 36.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-11\">In United States v. Wetherell, 65 Fed. 987, 13 C. C. A. 264, where a similar controversy arose, the Circuit Court of Appeals in the First Circuit found that \u201cwhat is commercially known as \u2018sheet steel\u2019 is rolled hot in mills called \u2018sheet mills,\u2019 especially adapted for the purpose, between rolls running so slowly that the sheets cannot be run over 12 feet in length, and that the sheets are not less than 8 inches wide.\u201d And the court, construing paragraph 148 of the tariff act of 1890 (Act Oct. 1, 1890, c. 1244, Schedule C, 26 Stat. 577), held that the words \u201csheet steel in strips\u201d in said act, if they stood alone, \u201cmight be construed as meaning steel prepared in sheets in the ordinary sheet mills, and then in some way cut or sheared into strips.\u201d But in view, inter alia, of the uncertainty as to whether strips sheared from what is commercially known as \u201csheet steel\u201d had ever been imported, and of the fact that said act provided for sheet steel in strips, \u201cwhether drawn through dies or rolls,\u201d and that sheet steel could not be \u201cdrawn through dies or rolls,\u201d while the strips of steel there in question could be thus drawn, the court reached the conclusion that they were covered by the provisions of said act.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>The provisions of the present act as to sheet steel in strips do not contain the words \u201cwhether drawn through dies or rolls,\u201d and the importer has proved in this case that sheet steel in strips, stripped from commercial sheet steel, were, at and prior to the passage of this act, an important article in the trade and commerce of this country, and were known among dealers generally and uniformly as \u201csheet steel in strips.\u201d Each of the strips here involved is produced by rolling a billet or bar to a width of from one-half an inch to less than six inches; it is not cut or sheared from a piece of greater width; and such strips are known in trade and commerce as \u201csteel strips,\u201d or as \u201ccold-rolled steel.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b93-4\">The decision is reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
