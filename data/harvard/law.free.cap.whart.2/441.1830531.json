The defendant also gave in evidence an agreement made on the 28th day of January 1826, between Peter Ott and Robert Lyons, as follows: \u201cWhereas J, Peter Ott, having purchased from Andrew Whitesell the bonds and obligations against the within named Robert Lyons, and having and do hereby agree for myself, my heirs, &amp;c. to stand by and fulfil the stipulations and conditions contained in the within memorandum\u2014and it is now fully understood that the said Robert Lyons agrees to pay on the first of April next, $100 with the interest, and so on yearly, and every year $100 with the interest, until the whole obligations are paid.\u201d The defendant then gave in evidence one of the said bonds payable on the 1st of April 1820, for $600, which bond had been assigned to Petfer Ott, and settled with him by the defendant. The defendant then offered in evidence two bonds, dated the 26th of February 1817, from Robert Lyons to Andrew Whitesell; the first payable on the 1st of April 1818, for $600, the second on the 1st of April 1819, for 600 dollars; which bonds had not been assigned to Peter Ott, but were paid by Lyons to Andrew Whitesell before the agreement of the 28 th of January 1826.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b442-6\">To the admission of wdiich two bonds with their endorsements in evidence, the plaintiff by his counsel objected.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b442-7\">1st. \u201cBecause in the notice of special matter given him by the defendant\u2019s counsel, there was no notice that these bonds would be offered in evidence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b442-8\">(The notice of special matter referred to after stating the suit, proceeded as follows :\u2014\u201c Under the pleading in this case, the defendant will offer in evidence, on the trial thereof, an agreement, whereof the following is a copy; the covenants of which, he avers, have been kept by him.\u201d Then followed copies of the agreements above recited.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b442-9\">2d. \u201c Because the bonds offered in evidence were paid and settled before the agreement of the 28th, of January 1826, and the defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>ant could not show anything that was done before that date, for the purpose of affecting said agreement or the bonds now in suit.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b443-6\">The court overruled the objections and admitted the evidence; and the plaintiff\u2019s counsel excepted to the decision.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b443-7\">A verdict having been given for the defendant upon the evidence, the plaintiff removed the cause to this court, and assigned for error the admission of the evidence.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b443-8\">Mr. <em>Hepburn, </em>for the plaintiff in error,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AF4\">argued that the agreement of 1826 governed the contract of the parties, and that agreement had reference only to the bonds purchased by the plaintiff.

The counsel for the defendant in error, have treated it as a ratification, in all its parts, of the previous' agreement between Whitesell and Lyons ; but if this \"be so, it is not easy to perceive why the agreement of 1826 was made, for the assignment of itself worked no change in the rights and obligations of either party; they remain precisely as before the assignment. ,But the parties must have had something else in view, for the latter is not a ratification of the former, but a new and distinct agreement between the assignee and obligor, entered into after the assignment, containing a different stipulation by Lyons, without reference to the performance of the covenants'contained in the first agreement. \u25a0 The former agreement is incorporated in the latter so far as respects the covenants of the obligor, but no further; the engagements of the obligor are entirely changed; and this seems to have been t.he reason, the assignee and obligor have entered into a new contract. The agreement of the 28th of January 1826 recites that Beter Ott had purchased from Andrew Whitesell, \u201c the bonds and obligations of the within-named Robert Lyons,\u201d referring to, the -bonds and obligations which remained unpaid, and not to those which had been cancelled by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>Whitesell before the assignment. Ott having, by the assignment of the 22d of October 1823, become owner of tne bonds and mortgage, covenants that he will fulfil the conditions and stipulations contained in the former agreement, viz: that he will allow further time for payment; in consideration of which Lyons agrees that he will pay Ott, the assignee, on the 1st of April then next ensuing, one hundred dollars, with the interest on the whole sum, and so on yearly, and every year, one hundred dollars, with the interest, until the whole obligations are paid. It is further provided, that in case Lyons fail to comply with the agreement, it shall be at the option of the obligee to consider the agreement void, and to proceed upon the bonds and mortgage. The only mode, therefore, by which the defendant could defeat the action.which was brought to enforce the payment of the whole amount, was by proof of the performance -by him, of the last agreement, viz. by payment of one hundred dollars, on the 1st of April 1826, with the interest, and a payment of a like sum at each succeeding 1st of April, until the whole debt was paid. But the evidence does not tend -to prove performance of the agreement between Ott and Lyons; it shows nothing further, than that Lyons had fulfilled the agreement between himself and Whitesell, with which the latter agreement has nothing to do, except so far as its stipulations are incorporated in the new contract. The evidence was therefore admitted, not only on erroneous principles, but misled the jury; for it is conceded, that without taking into the calculation the.payments which had been previously made to Whitesell, Lyons had failed to comply with the contract, and that it was at the pleasure of the plaintiff to consider the agreement void, and to proceed upon the bonds and mortgage.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">This disposition of the principal part makes it unnecessary to decide whether the notice of special matter was sufficiently explicit. As this cause will go to another jury, it may be material for the counsel to inquire what, if any, was the consideration of the promise of the forbearance either in the first or second agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-7\">Judgment reversed, and a <em>venire de novo </em>awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
