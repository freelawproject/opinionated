That the present plaintiff agreed to exonerate, or hold not liable or responsible the defendant from any liability on this note. That there were several notes on which the said drawer, George Emerick, was liable to the plaintiff, and which the plaintiff had discounted; and that the said George Emerick, the drawer, became extremely ill, and was not prepared to take up the paper when it became due, at which time the plaintiff told the said George Emerick, that if the-said George Emerick would give him, the said plaintiff, a .bond on his, the said George Emerick\u2019s property, he would release and take his, the said George Emerick\u2019s simple paper for all that was coming to him ; to which the said George Emerick afterwards agreed, and did give him such bond, provided the bond would not be entered up, unless some subsequent judgment should come, of which the said George Emerick would inform the plaintiff. That a suit was subsequently instituted against the said George Emerick, by another person, of which said George Emerick inform* ed the plaintiff, but found he had already entered up the bond, in breach of his agreement, but said he did not intend to do any thing to injure the said George, and that he would take the said George\u2019s own note in place of the one'in question (in this suit,) and others. That in the meantime some other notes became due, and the plaintiff took the simple notes,of the said George Emerick therefor. That after this note became due, the plaintiff said that he was cramped, and solicited witness to give him the same kind of paper; that of the said George had laid over, but with the same kind of paper (that is, with the defendant\u2019s endorsement,) he would get the money, and said, \u2018 remember, I do not hold your brothers\u2019 (one of whom is the defendant) \u2018 responsible, it being merely for my accommodation,\u2019 which was communicated to the defendant. That the said plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>had repeatedly said he did never expect to get anything from the defendant, as he did not hold him liable; and even so late as the month of March, 1834, the plaintiff rendered to the said George an account, in which he charged him with the note in question in this suit; and that afterwards, he sold property of the said George to a considerable amount.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b52-6\">The witness was objected to by the plaintiff\u2019s counsel, and the judge ruled that his testimony was not admissible, on the ground that being a party to the note, he was not competent to invalidate it.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> The defendant\u2019s counsel excepted to this decision, and on the return of the record, assigned for error the rejection of the witness.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b52-7\">'Mr. <em>Keeml\u00e9 </em>and Mr. <em>Ritiera, </em>for the plaintiff in error,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AyV\">admitted that the rule in Pennsylvania, as laid down in <em>Griffith </em>v. <em>Reford, </em>(1 <em>Rawle, </em>196,) and <em>Gest </em>v. <em>Espy, </em>(2 <em>Watts, </em>265,) was that a party to a negotiable note, actually negotiated, cannot be a witness to invalidate it; but they contended that the rule did not apply as between the original parties, and endeavoured to show from the condition of the bond given in evidence, that Harley, the plaintiff, was to be considered in the same light, and was subject to the same equities. They cited also <em>Hill </em>v. <em>Ely, </em>(5 <em>Serg. &amp; Rawle, </em>365.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b52-8\">Mr. <em>J. P.

That the rule was-the same in the Supreme Court of the United States, they argued from the case of the <em>Bank of the Metropolis </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>(8 <em>Peters's Rep. </em>12.)</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b52-11\"> See 1 <em>Miles, </em>36, <em>(Harley </em>v.

The condition of the bond given in evidence certainly proves nothing of the hind; and there is nothing else upon the record, to lay a foundation for the testimony offered. The witness was therefore properly rejected, and the judgment must be</p>\n<p id=\"b52-10\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
