A policy of insurance executed by the defendants, an incorporated company, under their seal, for the term of one year, contained a clause that persons desirous of continuing their insurances, might do so by a timely payment of the premium, without beino' subject to any charge for the policy. The insurance was accordingly continued from year to year by endorsements on the policy, which were not under seal: <em>Held, </em>that these endorsements did not continue the instrument as a specialty; and therefore, that the action of covenant would not lie to recover for a loss incurred after the expiration of the first term.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b167-11\">2.

And it was thereby agreed by the said parties, that that policy should expire at twelve o\u2019clock at noon, on the fourteenth day of November, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and thirty-four. And whereas, also, on the twenty-eighth day of May, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and thirty-four, the said The American Fire Insurance Company, as appears by <em>endorsement on the </em>said policy of insurance, received of the said plaintiff one dollar by way of premium, for an insurance of five hundred dollars; namely, on merchandise, three hundred dollars, and furniture, two hundred dollars, on the terms and conditions aforesaid, until the fourteenth of November, in the year of our Lord, one thousand eight hundred and thirty-four, at noon. And whereas the said The American Fire Insurance Company, on the fourteenth day of November, eighteen hundred find thirty-four, at the county aforesaid, in consideration of the sum of ten dollars and fifty cents, paid to them by the said plaintiff, as appears by endorsement on the said policy, did agree to continue the said insurance for one year, ending at noon on the fourteenth day of November, eighteen hundred and thirty-five, for the sum of three thousand dollars, namely, on merchandise, two thousand four hundred dollars, on furniture, five hundred dollars, and on fixtures, one hundred dollars.

And the said plaintiff in fact, further says, that at the time of making the said policy of insurance, he, the said plaintiff, was interested in the said insured merchandise, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>furniture and fixtures, in the said policy.*; of insurance mentioned, and thereby intended to be insured t\u00f3\u00bfa large amount, to wit, to the amount of seven thousand dollars, t6,wit, at Philadelphia aforesaid, and remained, and continued so infested therein, and owner thereof, from the making of the said policj||^\u00a3dnsin$ice till this time.

Yet the said J. L. ' in fact saith, that the said The American Fire Insurance Company have not paid to him the said sum of seven thousand dollars or any any part thereof, nor made good-the said damage in manner aforesaid, contrary to the form and effect of the said deed, and of their covenant so made by them in that behalf as aforesaid. And so the said John saith, that the said The American Fire Insurance Company, although often thereto requested,-have.not kept with and performed to him their aforesaid covenant, but have broken the same, and to perform the same have altogether refused, and still do refuse, to the damage of the said John of ten thousand dollars, lawful money of the United States, and therefore he brings suit, &amp;c.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b171-8\">Mr. <em>Hazlehurst </em>now contended that the amendments ought to be admitted, as they set forth no new cause of action; and according to the cases, so long as the plaintiff adheres to the original ground of his claim, he has a right to amend. <em>Rodrigue </em>v. <em>Curcier, </em>(15 <em>Serg. </em>&lt;5* <em>Rawle, </em>83.) <em>Coxe </em>v. <em>Tilghman, </em>(1 <em>Wharton\u2019s Rep. </em>287.) Even after judgment on demurrer, the Court will grant leave <em>to </em>amend. <em>Burke </em>v. <em>Huber, </em>(2 <em>Watts, </em>311.) The question then is, whether the renewal of an insurance is not to be considered as a re-execution of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>the instrument. The instrument is the same, and so are the parties. It is not a substituted agreement, but a continued one. In <em>Vickary </em>v. <em>Moore, </em>(2 <em>Watts, </em>451,) there was an agreement for an alteration, which resolved the whole into parol. In the present case, there was no modification. In <em>Gower </em>v. <em>Sterner, </em>at this term, <em>{ante, </em>p. 75,) it was held that the plaintiff might declare in covenant upon a specialty amended by parol. In <em>Moliere </em>v. <em>The Penn. Fire Ins. Co. </em>(5 <em>Rawle, </em>247,) covenant was brought under circumstances like the present, and the exception was not taken.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b172-6\">Mr. <em>W. B. Reed, </em>and Mr. <em>F. W. Hubbell, </em>for the defendants:\u2014</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b172-7\">The averments in the two declarations differ materially. This is not the case of a mere renewal, or continuance from year to year\u2014 there was an enlarged risk, and a new premium. <em>1 </em>By the policy, he was entitled to a new instrument under seal, upon which he might have maintained covenant; but upon the parol agreement for renewal, he can only maintain <em>assumpsit. </em>It is settled that <em>assumpsit </em>will lie against an Insurance Company; 2 <em>Phillips on Ins. </em>377. .Where a specialty has been varied <em>by </em>parol, the plaintiff must sue in <em>assumpsit. Vansant </em>v. <em>Sanford, </em>(12 <em>Johns. </em>197.) These agreements are not mere renewals, but substantive agreements. The cases on the subject of amendments, show that the new declaration is not admissible. <em>Farmers </em>&amp; <em>Mechanics\u2019 Bank </em>v. <em>Israel, </em>(6 <em>Serg. </em>&amp; <em>Rawle, </em>294.) <em>Diehl </em>v. <em>M\u2018Glue, </em>(2 <em>Rawle, </em>337.) <em>Coxe </em>v. <em>Tilghman, </em>(1 <em>Wharton\u2019s Rep. </em>289.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b172-8\">The opinion of the Court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b172-9\">Gibson, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"ALq\">An alteration which is not an amendment, may be disallowed; and indeed the parties have put the issue of the contest on the question whether covenant is maintainable on the case set out in the new counts; or, in other words, whether the insurance laid, was effected by specialty, or by parol. The original <em>policy </em>covered the stock of a confectioner, valued at #2000; which was, by express stipulation, to expire at the end of a year. It is not pretended that any new policy was sealed; but it is supposed that subsequent contracts of insurance were introduced into the old one, through a clause in the printed conditions annexed to it, which is undoubtedly a part of it. By this clause, it is provided that \u201c persons desirous of continuing their insurances, may do so, by a timely payment of the premium, without being subject to any charge for the policy;\u201d and the first step taken by the assured, was not to continue the original insurance, but to insure an additional sum by payment and endorsement of an additional premium within the year, and without a correspondent alteration of the instrument, or the execution of a new one. The amount insured was extended <em>by </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>payment and endorsement of a further premium at the end of the first year, to $3000, and swelled during the second, to $5000; which was further increased for the'third, being that in which the loss occurred, by $2000 more. Now stript of the right of renewal, it would not be pretended, that the executed policy had not expired by efflux of time, or that without adaptation and redelivery, it could be used to embody a subsequent contract. The commercial nature of insurance, may serve to relax the rigidity of rules of construction; but it can dispense with no technical formality inherent in the constitution of a common law instrument. Unassisted by a particular ' stipulation, an expired policy stands on the footing of an expired lease, which, though it be competent to show the conditions of a subsequent letting by parol, is incompetent to show a subsequent letting by deed, unless it were re-delivered, having been altered to comport with the date and duration of the term. What, then, is the, _ effect of the clause in question, which, it must be admitted, was as effectually incorporated with the original policy, as if it were contained in the body of it <em>1 It </em>runs,';that previous insurance might <em>be </em>prolonged by payment of premiupvonly, and without an additional charge for the policy. Does that import a right to renew the contract as a specialty, without renewing the instrument as a specialty 1 It imports no more than that the instrument should be furnished by the company free of an expense which would otherwise have been equal to the premium of an insurance on $500, and which might well be thought sufficiently important, <em>to be made </em>a subject <em>of </em>particular stipulation. But taking 'that to- be otherwise, how could the essence of a contract be changed by an agreement, so as to make that a specialty which is no specialty by the common law <em>I </em>It is to be remembered, that the action is not on the instrument as it was executed; that the' insurance effected by it, expired at the appointed time; that the clause in question, regards insurance to be made thereafter; and that every renewal, even on the old terms, was necessarily to <em>be </em>a distinct contract\u2014a consideration which makes it unnecessary to insist on the fact, that each renewal was actually on new and different terms. Now it'will not be pretended, that an agreement can dispense with those forms of subsequent execution, which the law declares essential to give the contract extension, and yet preserve its generic character. A clause that subsequent verbal alterations or additions, should be treated as if they were incorporated with the instrument, and make the whole a specialty, would fail of the effect; and parol endorsements have no greater force than verbal stipulations. A covenant that notes or bills to be drawn, should have the qualities of specialties, would not make them so, or confound the settled distinctions of the ' law. It is said by <em>Perkins, </em>sect. 129, that a deed must be actually sealed; and that a writing delivered as a deed, is <em>not </em>such without it\u2014a principle observed in <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Glaser, </em>(2 <em>Serg. &amp; Rawle, </em>502,) where the writing, though <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>said to be sealed in the conclusion, and in the memorandum of attestation, was held to be but parol. If, then, the payment of a further premium cannot make the old policy a new one, what is the effect of it? Precisely the effect of an order to .insure, and no more. The plaintiff might have demanded a policy in conformity to the clause, and have maintained an action for a breach of it; or he might perhaps maintain <em>assumpsit </em>on the contract remaining in parol: but he cannot maintain covenant on what is no more than the conditions of a deed to be executed.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">Rule discharged.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
