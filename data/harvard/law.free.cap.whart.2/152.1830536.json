The indorser of a promissory note is not a competent witness to prove the handwriting of the drawer, in an action by the holder of the note against him; because he would be entitled, if the plaintiff should recover, to an assignment of the judgment against the drawer, on paying the amount of the note, &amp;c.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b152-8\">2.

' The first count was on the acceptance by the defendant, of a bill of exchange, dated Dublin, January 13th, 1826, payable 31 days after date, for thirty-six pounds sterling, drawn on the defendant by Thomas Morrison, payable to his own order, and endorsed by him. The second count was on a promissory note, drawn by&lt;the defendant on the 23d day of December 1825, at Dublin, for <em>\u00a330 </em>sterling payable two months after date in favour of Thomas Morrison, and by him endorsed. Thei\u2019e was also a count for money lent, &amp;c. The declaration averred, that at the time of the making of the <em>bill </em>of exchange and promissory note, the plaintiffs were and still are non-residents of the United States; to wit, that they are residents of Dublin in the kingdom of Ireland, &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b152-11\">The defendant pleaded <em>non assumpsit </em>and payment, set-off, <em>non assumpsit infra sex annos, actio non accrevit infra sex annos, </em>&amp;c.

The defendant\u2019s counsel objected to the competency of the witness; but the learned Judge admitted him, and the defendant\u2019s counsel excepted to the decision.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b153-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>The Judge charged the jury that the plaintiffs having been beyond seas when the cause of action accrued; were not bound by the japse of six years since the bill and note were payable, but that upon the law the plaintiff was entitled to recover; to which also the defendant\u2019s counsel excepted; and the jury found\" for the plaintiff</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b153-6\">A rule to show cause why a new trial should not be granted, having\u2019been discharged,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> the defendant removed the record to this Court, and assigned the following errors, viz.:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b153-7\">\u201c 1st.

That the saving clause in the 5th section of the act of 27th March 1713, about limitation of actions relating to persons beyond seas, does not extend to actions ori the case, brought to recover the amount of promissory notes or bills of exchange.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b153-10\">4-th.

That Morrison was not a competenf'witness-to prove the hand-writing of the drawer of the note, for which he was offered, inasmuch as he would be liable to the plaintiff, if the hand-writing of the drawer should be forged. <em>Sykes </em>v. <em>Summerill, </em>(3 <em>Yeates, </em>531.) <em>Herrick </em>v. <em>Whitney, </em>(15 <em>Johns. </em>240.) <em>Barnes </em>v. <em>Bull, </em>(1 <em>Mass. Rep. </em>73.) <em>Rice </em>v. <em>Stearns, </em>(3 <em>Mass. Rep. 225.) </em>The Judge who delivered the opinion of the District Court on the motion for a new trial, relied on the case of <em>Dickinson </em>v. <em>Prentice, </em>(4 <em>Esp. N. P. </em>32,) which decided that the <em>drawer </em>of a bill was competent to prove the hand-writing of the <em>acceptor, </em>which is a different case from this; because the drawer does not warrant the hand-writing, of the acceptor. The cases cited on the other side, are all cases of <em>bills; </em>and it does not appear that in any of them, the drawer was also endorser. <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Downing, </em>(4 <em>Serg. &amp; Rawle, </em>97.) <em>Stille </em>v. <em>Lynch, </em>(2 <em>Dall. </em>194.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b153-12\">2d- That the action of <em>assumpsit </em>was not included within the actions, mentioned in the saving clause of the act of 27th March 1713. The act of 28th May 1715, authorising suits upon promissory notes, &amp;c.,in the name of the holders, declares that they shall be commenced within the time appointed for commencing actions on the case by the act of 1713 ; which act excepts only actions of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>trespass, detinue, &amp;c. <em>Sacia </em>v. <em>De Graff, </em>(1 <em>Cowen, </em>356.) 2 <em>Saunders, </em>120. 2 <em>Mod. </em>71. <em>Bishop </em>v. <em>Young, </em>(2 <em>Bos. &amp; Pul. </em>78.) <em>Chitty, </em>56. 8 <em>Mod. </em>373. 1 <em>Strange, </em>680.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b154-7\">Mr. <em>J.

The interest which is to cause the rejection of a witness, must be direct in the event of the suit. <em>Wakely </em>v. <em>Hart, </em>(6 <em>Binn. </em>319.) <em>Cornogg </em>v. <em>Abraham, </em>(1 <em>Yeates, </em>84.) <em>Hays </em>v. <em>Green, </em>(4 <em>Dinn. </em>83.) <em>Hart </em>v. <em>Heilner, </em>(3 <em>Rawle, </em>407.) <em>Dickinson </em>v. <em>Prentice, </em>(4 <em>Esp.

As to the acts of limitations, the decisions under the British statute are numerous and conclusive, <em>(Ballentine, </em>181); and the legislature must be^upposed to have passed the acts of 1713 and 1715 with the knowledge of them. <em>Pennock </em>v. <em>Dialogue, </em>(2 <em>Peters, </em>1.)</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b153-13\"> For the arguments in the Court below, and the opinion of the Court, see 1 <em>Miles, </em>204, <em>(Reid </em>v. <em>Geoghegan.)</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b154-9\">The opinion of the Court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b154-10\">Sergeant, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AAq\">It is not necessary to decide the question, how far the endorser is bound to warrant the genuineness of the maker\u2019s signature, and therefore not a competent witness to prove it; because we are of opinion, that there is another reason why the witness is directly interested in the event of this suit. That is, that if the plaintiff recover, the witness may, by paying the amount of debt, interest and costs to the plaintiff, demand from him an assignment of the judgment. This right may be considered, under the decisions of this Court, as a matter of courseand one which the Court below would enforce by rule. In <em>Burns </em>v. <em>The Huntingdon Bank, </em>(1 <em>Penn. Rep. </em>395,) this power was exercised in favour of an endorser who had paid half the amount of the note, against persons who had become securities for the maker for a stay of execution.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-11\">On the question as to the extent of the saving clause in the act of limitations, we think the opinion of the Court below right. Our act of assembly is copied nearly <em>verbatim </em>from the English statute; and the construction of the latter had been previously settled by judicial decisions. It is presumable, that our legislature were acquainted with this construction, and meant to adopt it. If the point were now open to discussion, it seems to be a just and reasonable interpretation of the statute, according to its spirit and the general design of its provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-12\">Judgment reversed, and a <em>venire facias de novo </em>awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
