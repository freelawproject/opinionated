Moses Holmes died on the lstday of November, 1832. His disease was supposed to b <em>epulmonaryax\u00fatracheal consumption. </em>Dr. Tucker, who visited him once, stated that he was labouring under a complication of diseases, one of which was consumption-, another a <em>tracheal paralysis, </em>which deprived him of the power of speech. The plaintiff was a brother of the half blood of Holmes, and the defendant was an intimate friend. On Sunday the 18th of October, 1832, Nicholas visited Holmes, and received from him, (as was supposed, though there was no evidence upon the point,) two gold watches\u2014one of which he brought away with him\u2014the other, though delivered to him by Holmes, was in consequence of some objections by Lewis Adams, left in Holmes\u2019 possession, and subsequently deposited in a trunk belonging to him and being in his sick chamber. On the 22d of October, Nicholas in company with one Stephen Gloucester, called on Mr.. Joseph Brewster, a member of the bar, and stated to him the circumstances connected \u2022 with the supposed gift of the watches by Holmes on the day before; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>and under his advice, with a paper writing which he prepared, Nicholas; Gloucester, and an individual named Glasgow, repaired to the house of Adams, and requested'to see Holmes.

Nicholas remarked, he had but a short time to stay, and said, \u2018 Mr. Holmes, I have come up to see you this morning about those watches which you gave me yesterday.\u2019 The nurse at this discovered some uneasiness, and said, his half brother (Adams) said he should not be disturbed. Nicholas pulled out the watch he had in his pocket, and he then told Mr. Holmes of a watch which was in a trunk, and which Adams had refused to let him take away yesterday. Pie told him he had brought me up to see him give those watches to him. Mr. Nicholas had a paper in his hand, which Mr. Brewster had drawn as an evidence of the gift, and he said he had brought me and Glasgow up to see whether this was what he meant.

I gave him this as the interpretation of the paper. I asked that- Glasgow should be brought up. _ The nurse would not permit it; and said that Holmes had given <em>him </em>that watch yesterday.

Holmes put the paper on his knee and went to make the mark. His hand trembled very much; Nicholas took hold to steady it. Nurse and I both objected to this. Holmes shook the pen at the nurse to hush. Holmes then undertook to put the pen to the paper again, and then dropped the ink now on the paper. The lawyer told us, that Nicholas might guide his hand. The nurse remarked, Holmes did not make the first mark. I then stept forward, and said to Holmes, \u2018You have made a blot here. Now make a mark yourself.\u2019 He then made the mark now there, and I turned around to the nurse, and said, \u2018 are you satisfied now <em>V </em>She said, \u2018 yes.\u2019 Holmes pointed to his trunk\u2014it was lifted up to him.

The plaintiff\u2019s counsel have declined addressing you; I will assume the facts to be precisely in accordance with the defendant\u2019s statement of them, and in point of law, on that statement, the plaintiff is entitled to your verdict. My opinion is founded upon the fact, that the will under which the plaintiff claims, was made subsequent to the alleged gift of the watches to the defendant. Whether a subsequent will revokes a prior gift <em>causa mortis </em>is a question undecided. I do not say therefore, that a subsequent will operates as such revocation, but I do say, that the fact of a will having been made subsequent to the alleged <em>donatio causa </em>mortis, regularly proved before the register and not impeached on the trial, is conclusive evidence that the gift was not made during such a last sickness, as the law requires to constitute a disposition of property <em>causa </em>mortis; and that even if at the time of the gift, the sickness was such as to induce the donor to believe, and he did believe, that he was very near his death, and had not time to make a disposition of his property by will, yet if after-wards, and after the lapse of more than six days a will in writing should be made by him and duly proved after his death, and not impeached on the trial, this is conclusive evidence, that the donor had escaped from the peril of death, which he supposed to impend over him when he made the donation; and it cannot take effect.as. a <em>donatio causa mortis.\u201d</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b19-9\">The defendant\u2019s counsel excepted to this chai\u2019ge; and a motion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>for a new trial, having been denied by the court below,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> removed the record to this court, where the following errors were assigned.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b20-6\">\u201c 1.

Two questions are in dispute here. 1st, Is it necessary that the donor should be <em>in extremis </em>at the time of the gift? and 2d, Was the gift in this case revoked or determined by the will of the 29th of October, 1832 ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b20-12\">1. There are only three cases upon this subject in our reports; one of which'was in Pennsylvania, <em>Wells </em>v. <em>Tucker, </em>(3 <em>Binn. </em>169.) In that case the donor lived three days after the gift. The English cases are numerous; and in many of them, the gift was a long time before the death of the giver. The earliest case is <em>Hedges </em>v. <em>Hedges, </em>in 1708, <em>(Prec. in Chan. </em>269;) which was reversed in the House of Lords. (1 <em>Br. P. C. </em>254.) The next was <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Selby, </em>(1 <em>Br. P. C. </em>300,) in which it appears that the <em>donatio </em>was three years before death; though the point does not appear to have been made. In <em>Lawson </em>v. <em>Lawson, </em>(1 <em>P. Wms. </em>441,) the donor died seventeen days after the gift. In <em>Hassel v. Tynte, (Ambler, 318,) six </em>weeks afterwards. In <em>Hill </em>v. <em>Chapman, </em>(4 <em>Br. Ch. Rep. </em>612,) the gift appears to have been made while the donor was in perfect health. In <em>Walker </em>v. <em>Hodge, </em>(2 <em>Swanst. </em>97,) it is said to be sufficient if the <em>donatio </em>is made in contemplation of death. In <em>Bunn </em>v. <em>Markham, </em>(7 <em>Taunt. </em>224,) there was an interval of one year. There are several <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>other English cases, which negative the idea that it is necessary that the donor should be <em>in extremis. Hurst </em>v. <em>Beach, </em>(5 <em>Madd. C. R. </em>351.) <em>Tale v. Hibbert, </em>(2 <em>Ves. jr. </em>111.) <em>Blount </em>v. <em>Burrow, </em>(2 <em>Br. Ch. Rep. </em>71.) Indeed the very condition of the gift, viz., that it shall be returned if the donor recovers, seems to contradict this supposition. Now in this case, the evidence shows that the donor was in his last sickness; that he was in great peril; that his end was rapidly approaching, and that he made the gift in expectation of death: and he died within two weeks afterwards.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b21-6\">Mr. <em>G. A\u00cd. Wharton </em>and Mr. <em>J. C. Biddle, </em>for the defendant in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b21-7\">There is no evidence of what passed between the testator and Nicholas on the 18th of October. After that day he was unable to make himself understood distinctly. Upon the facts as exhibited by the record, there is nothing to induce the court to lean in favour of the alleged donee. After having endeavoured to establish his claim as a will, he cannot be allowed to set it up as a <em>donatio mortis causa. </em>The writing executed on the 22d of October, must be deemed a will; and if so, it was revoked by the general will, executed seven days afterwards. It is true that Lord Hakdwicke has said, that a <em>donatio mortis causa </em>may be in writing ; but in the only case mentioned by him, the instrument conferring the gift was held\u2019to be a will. In t\u00edre 9th volume of the London Law Magazine, page 326, is a learned essay on the subject, which may be cited as evidence of the sense of the profession, and in which it is expressly said, that \u201c by the law of England a <em>donatio mortis causa </em>is made by,parol only.\u201d (Page 344.) The elementary writers, Roper and Williams, are not supported by the authorities cited when they lay it down that a <em>donatio </em>is not revoked by a subsequent will. r i the recent case of <em>Hambrooke </em>v. <em>Simmons, </em>(4 <em>Russel, </em>25.) is wade a <em>quaere </em>whether such gift is avoided'by a will or co.iiui subsequently made. It is laid down in . many books, that a <em>donatio </em>is not good unless made while the donor was <em>in extremis. </em>In this case he lived fourteen days after the supposed donation. Upon the ground of policy, the courts ought to lean against encouraging this kind of nuncupative will, since they open the door to great frauds upon sick men, and are likely to defeat the intention of the legislature in respect to the legacy duties. The following authorities were cited and commented upon in the course of the argument. 2 <em>Kent\u2019s Comm. </em>358, 360, (last ed.) <em>Yarnall\u2019s case, </em>(4 <em>Rawle, </em>46.) 1 <em>Jacob\u2019s Law Dict. tit.

Contested death-bed donations are of such occurrence in the courts, as to have superseded all others, and to have grown, in the apprehension of the judges, from a species to a genus; and hence the notion that they are referable exclusively to death-bed sickness. If made in sickness, it must necessarily be the last sickness; for the contingency happens adversely to the donee, where the donor is restored to health. But this notion seems to be yielding to more comprehensive principles. In his <em>Treatise on Legacies, </em>page 26, Mr. Roper, whose accuracy as a text-writer is creditable .to him, says, it is necessary that the gift be made in peril of death, <em>or </em>during the donor-\u2019s last illness, and to take effect only in case he die. This would be critically correct, were it not redundant in one particular, and too narrow in another; redundant, because it is indifferent whether the peril of death be induced by sickness or any other cause. Thus,, the peril past, the gift of a soldier or a malefactor might be retracted, though made in perfect health, when going to execution or to battle. But his position is also too narrow in one particular; for a groundless apprehension of de\u00a7.th is necessarily as operative to make a gift conditional, as if the danger were real. No one would hesitate to say that the gift of a man in the predicament of Parolles', when sportively doomed by his friends, in the guise of ferocious enemies, might be recalled. I would, therefore, briefly define a <em>donatio causa mortis </em>to be a conditional gift, dependent on the contingency of expected death. There may, doubtless, be a conditional gift, when death is not expected; but in that case the condition would have to be expressed, and the contingency specified; in the <em>donatio causa mortis, </em>both are implied from the occasion. But it is certainly not requisite that the donor be in such extremity as is . <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>requisite to give effect.to a nuncupation, which is sustained from necessity merely, where the donor was prevented by the urgency of dissolution, from making a formal bequest. Between these ways of disposition, there is not one approximating line. <em>Donatio causa mortis </em>is sometimes spoken of as being distinct from a gift <em>inter vivos; </em>the former having sometimes been supposed to be made in , reference to the donor\u2019s death, and not to vest before it\u2014but inaccurately, as it seems to me; as this gift, like every other, is not executory, but executed in the first instance, by delivery of the thing, though defeasible by reclamation, the contingency of survivorship, or deliverance from the peril. The donee would certainly not be bound to make compensation for the intermediate use of the thing; and ev\u2019dently because the intermediate ownership was vested in him. The gift is consequently <em>inter vivos. </em>All agree that it has no property in common with a legacy, except that it is revocable in the donor\u2019s lifetime, and subject to his debts, in the event of a deficiency. The first is, not because the gift is testamentary, but because such is the condition annexed to it; and the second, not because it is in the nature of a legacy, but because it would otherwise be fraudulent as to creditors; for no man may give his property, who is unable to pay his debts. It is decisive, that the subject is not within the jurisdiction of the ecclesiastical courts; and the donee, consequently, takes paramount to the executor or a legatee. For this reason it is, that a subsequent will which becomes operative, only when the period of reclamation is past, and when the gift has become absolute by the event of the contingency, is not an effective act of revocation. I therefore cannot subscribe to the doctrine, that the making of a subsequent will is conclusive evidence of the gift having not been made during such a last illness as the law requires; and that if the degree of sickness were such as to induce an expectation of immediate death, the subsequent making of a formal will is conclusive that the donor had escaped from the peril of death which he supposed to impend at the time of the gift; and that under these circumstances, it cannot take effect as a <em>donatio causa mortis. </em>The direction to this effect, was obviously produced by an impression that this sort of gift is but a species of nuncupation, which is sustainable only as an equivalent for a legacy, and only where a formal testament could not be made; that it is annulled by deliverance, not from mortal peril, but from the apprehension of it; and it assumes that no one would make a conditional gift who could make a testament: conclusions in which we do not concur. To say nothing of the fallacy, that the making of a will indicates even a respite from sickness or the apprehension of death, a disposition \"by <em>donatio causa mortis </em>is not to be disturbed by the alternation of hope and dispair, dependent on the doubtful spinning of the die, but only by the turn up of life. Were it otherwise, the gift in the present instance would be void in its creation without regard to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>subsequent will, inasmuch as it was accompanied by a paper, which but for the delivery of the thing given, would be itself a will. Indeed it has been surmised that the gift was testamentary notwithstanding the delivery, and consequently revoked by the subsequent will. But though bearing a testamentary form, it is evident both from the context and the extrinsic proof, that the writing was designed only for evidence of a present gift. ,A delivery of the thing, accompanied by an oral expression of the same words, would certainly not have made a nuncupation; and the reduction of the words to writing cannot change their effect. They are precisely such as would be used by a man unaccustomed to technical language, with a view to constitute a <em>donatio causa mortis. </em>The law looks to substance, and here the recital of delivery in the paper itself, is decisive of its character; for no man thinks of giving by will and performing the office of his own executor. In <em>Tate </em>v. <em>Hibbert, </em>(2 <em>Ves. jr. </em>111,) Lord Loughborough inclined to think this species of donation might be effected by deed or writing, without delivery, though not by parol; but he certainly could not have meant an unsealed writing which, it has been finally settled, is still but parol, and requires the same consideration. He determined in the very case, that a voluntary promissory note, or banker\u2019s check, cannot be sustained as a <em>donatio causa mortis, </em>because not an actual transfer of specific money; and the principle has been repeated in <em>Parish </em>v. <em>Stone, (14 Pickering, </em>198.) Indeed it would seem to be impracticable even by deed, which, though it may obviate an objection to want of consideration, amounts, without delivery, only to a covenant which passes no title to a specific thing. But where the gift is executed, both the terms of it, and the fact of delivery, may be evidenced by writing, whether sealed or not.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"Agt\">But if the gift were not a <em>donatio causa mortis, </em>what title would that give the executor or a legatee 1 Whether absolute -or conditional, it is good'against the donor\u2019s representative by title subsequent. The condition is for the benefit of the donor; and here the evidence, written or verbal, shows a gift of some sort, which consequently must be taken to have been absolute in the first instance, if it were not conditional by the terms of the writing, or by implication from the nature of the occasion. It is an elementary definition of a gift, that it is a transfer of the title, of which, though the gift be in writing, delivery of the thing is the strongest and most essential evidence. It is a contract executed, which requires no consideration; and I am unable therefore to comprehend what is meant by a remark found in the books, that these donations cannot be supported by the general consideration of mortality. It never has been decided that any con-. sideration is necessary; nor could it be, without violating a common rudimental principle. \u201cA true or proper gift,\u201d says Sir William Blackstone, \u201c is always accompanied with delivery of possession, and takes effect immediately: as if A. gives B. \u00a3100, or a flock of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>sheep, and puts him in possession of them immediately, it is then a gift executed in the donee; and it is not in the donor\u2019s power to retract it, though he did it without any consideration or recompense. But if the gift does not take effect by an immediate delivery of possession, it is then not properly a gift but a contract; and this a man cannot be compelled to perform but upon good and sufficient consideration.\u201d (2 <em>Comm. </em>441.) Indeed if it were not gratuitous, it would be an exchange or a sale. The error of the coui\u2019t below seems to have had its root in a notion that this species' of donation is to be treated not as a gift <em>inter vivos, </em>but as a testamentary disposition, subject to restrictions like those of nuncupation, and taking effect for the first time at the donor\u2019s death; to countenance which, there is certainly much in the loose and confused <em>dicta </em>of the English jurists. Here the donor certainly made a gift, having power to do so on whatever condition he might choose to prescribe, or without condition at all; for no one will say that a man is competent to reserve a condition, only in the extremity of his last sickness. Even if the condition were void, the gift would be good. Yet it was not void; but the gift became absolute by the happening of the contingency. In its circumstances, the case fulfils all the indications in the concluding part of the paragraph in the Institutes, of which I have already extracted the beginning. \u201c <em>Et in summa, mortis causa donatio est, cum magis se quis velit habere, quam cum cui donat; magisque eum cui donat, quam hcvredem suum.\u201d </em>It will not be said that the donor did not so give as to evince that he would himself rather possess the thing, than that the donee should possess it; and yet that the donee should possess it, rather than the donor\u2019s legal representative. The gift was therefore perfect as a <em>donatio causa mortis.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b25-6\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
