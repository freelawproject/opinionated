Nace\u2019s property; I have a knowledge of Christopher Yeakle owning lands adjoining Nace\u2019s; woodland and clear land. The woodland adjoining the land of Nace, about one hundred yards from Willow Grove road; it was bounded besides by land of Mr. Peterman and Shettinger, and by William Keeper, and I don\u2019t know who else. The clear land was bounded by Ottenger\u2019s and the woodland. Last fall a year, Mr. Yeakle sold the wood leave of the land adjoining Nace\u2019s; I purchased some; I did not haul myself; it was hauled out by way of the upper road, called the township line road, formerly called the Germantown road ; the road I allude to is the county line between this county and Philadelphia; this has been opened longer than my recollection ; I did not try to get out along on Nace\u2019s line to the Willow Grove road; it was not opened; it would have been more convenient to get out by .Nace\u2019s, if it had been opened; much nigher and handier; it was not opened for us; it was fastened up by a fence. I was never present when Nace attempted to stop Yeakle from going over the land; I saw Nace hauling stone there one day; I saw the stones lying there at the bars, where Mr. Yeakle had opened the lane, and cut it down a little to make it easier to go out to the Willow Grove road. This was at the Willow road, to make it commodious to travel out to those who had purchased the wood; he cut it as wide as the bars, perhaps a little wider. The fence between Yeakle and Nace runs across the lane, marked on the draught up to Peterman\u2019s fence and line; there were several loads of stone; we could not have got out; he wedged the bars ; I saw him, Jacob Nace, hauling the stone; I saw that the bars were wedged; I did not attempt to get out that way; I think this was last October a year; shortly after the lots were sold. Nace\u2019s land' joins on the Willow Grove road ,* Peterman\u2019s and Nace\u2019s land joins.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b125-7\">Being cross-examined\u201c I never, owned, or purchased any of the land mentioned in Mr. Yeakle\u2019s deeds; never occupied them more than by occupying them to cut the wood. Mr. Yeakle lives some distance off this tract; about three quarters of a mile; he has lived off where he now does twelve or fifteen years; I neyer saw any lane opened along, the line through Mr. Nace\u2019s land; it has been enclosed as it now is, ever since I have known the property; there is no building on this property of Mr. Yeakle\u2019s; Yeakle\u2019s land has also been enclosed as it now is, so long as I have known it; the fences all extend across the lane to this fence; the lower fences of Yeakle also go across this lane.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b125-8\">Being re-examined:\u2014\u201c There are no partition fences from the line between Nace and Yeakle out to the end of Yeakle\u2019s property j <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>there is one now I recollect crossing the lane; there are bars there for the use of Mr. Yeakle and others who bought wood lots there ; Yeakle gave them the privilege.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b126-6\">Isaac Yeakle testified as follows:\u2014\u201cI am acquainted with the property of which that is a draught; have been there forty years; I never saw the draught before; the lot marked No. 11, adjoining the Willow Grove road, is Nace\u2019s, which A. Keyser purchased of Coombe\u2019s heirs; Coombe\u2019s property ran back a mile; the next one, No. 10, is Yeakle\u2019s; Yeakle owns from No. 5 up to Nace\u2019s, and all the way out to the county line; there are twenty or twenty-five acres of Woodland; there are no buildings on the lots .Yeakle bought of Coombe\u2019s executors; Yeakle always farmed the lots himself which he bought of Coombe\u2019s heirs; he was bred and born where he now lives; he lives about half a mile from the nearest lot; he is an old man; that called a lane never was a lane; it was never opened; I speak of what I know; Christopher Yeakle, about two years ago, sold a parcel of the wood off as wood leave, not the land; the purchasers wanted the road opened to go out to the Willow Grove road, and Christopher Yeakle went and opened the road to come out to the Willow Grove road; he went and took men and made bars at the Willow Grove road, at Nace\u2019s corner, to get out, and likewise fixed the road, so they could cart out the wood; Jacob Nace forbid it, and shut it up again; Nace put the bars away, and put up the fence again; he wedged the bars, and fastened them; Yeakle fetched them there.; there were no bars before\u2014none were wanted; it was left just as it was purchased; Nace hauled stone in the road; he put three or four perches there ; after that, they could not get out without hauling them away; Yealde had men and carts there; they dug down the bank at the corner, and fixed the road so that they could come out.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b126-7\">Being cross-examinedThe land above <em>lot No. </em>6, is Christopher Yeakle\u2019s; he does not live there; he lives at Chesnut Iiill; he owns Nos. 5,- 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10there never was any lane or road opened along the line\u2018through Nace\u2019s land; I never saw Mr. Yeakle or any body else want to go \u2018out with carts before; he went there to mend the way at the time I spoke of; I don\u2019t know about any other time; I heard Mr, Nace forbid Mr, Yeakle to open the road; he forbid him to do it; I was by and heard Nace speak to Yeakle; Nace said, \u2018 I forbid you to open that road,\u2019 \u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b126-8\">John Knible testified I helped Christopher Yeakle to open the road or lane near the Willow Grove road, directly after he had sold the wood leave; he took a horse and a cart, and rails and posts, and went across Nace\u2019s lot; he took four rails out as neatly as we could, planted posts and put in the rails, and cut down the bank and then left it; in the course of a few days after, I saw it; then the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>two posts were cut off at the bottom, the rails were thrown over on Yeakle\u2019s side, and his own put up as it was before we took it down; he examined it and found his rails were nailed fast in the post; he went there again with a few hands more, and we hauled several cart loads of stone off Yeakle\u2019s lots to the road, where it was not passable; we took the rails out again, and made them so we could take them in and out, and took out the nails, and cut down the bank a little more; a few days afterwards we went there to look if the road had been left as we left it;

He contends that he has shown such a right, by the evidence given in the cause, and the defendant denies that the evidence establishes such claim.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b129-6\">It appears, that although in the several deeds of Palmer and wife, the twenty feet wide road is mentioned as having been laid out, yet the agreement had never been carried into execution, and the grantees never took possession, or in any manner, used it as a way. There has been no fence enclosing it, nor any other act done showing that it was set apart from the rest of the land, to be used as a way. It was necessary for the plaintiff to show by some evidence, that he, or those under whom he claims, after the execution of the agreement referred to, either used the. ground as a road, or claimed the right so to use it. We do not agree with the plaintiff\u2019s counsel, that it would have made no difference in this case, had they proved that there was a fence, indicating the road or lane. We should have considered that a very different case from the present. The evidence that no road was ever opened or laid out, is certainly very strong. Keyser, who is an old. man, and who probably would have lmown, had the road ever been opened or used,.says he has known the land for fifty years; that he never heard of any road being there, and that none was ever used. Neither in Keyser\u2019s will, nor inNace\u2019s deed in 1826, is there any mention of a right of way. The defendant, and those under whom he claims, have had peaceable possession of the land over which the claim for a road is now set up, for twenty-nine years before the action \u25a0brought; and under the evidence in the cause, such possession is a bar to the plaintiff\u2019s claim. There is no dispute about the facts; and it is law, that a right of way or other easement will be lost by a <em>non-user </em>for twenty-one years. If you believe, therefore, that the defendant, and those under whom he claims, had the peaceable and exclusive possession of the land over which the right of way is claimed in this case for twenty-one years, the plaintiff is not entitled to recover, and the verdict must be for the defendant.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b129-7\">The plaintiff\u2019s counsel excepted to this charge; and having removed the record to this Court, assigned for error\u2014\u25a0</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b129-8\">\u201c That the Judge erred, in stating that a right of way would be lost by <em>non-user, </em>for twenty-one years.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b129-9\">Mr. <em>Mulvany </em>and Mr. <em>Hazlehurst, </em>for the plaintiff in error,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AaB\">cited <em>Hoy </em>v. <em>Sterett, </em>(2 <em>Watts, </em>331.) <em>White </em>v. <em>Crawford, </em>(10 <em>Mass.

This latter has been the course of the Supreme Court of the United States, and generally of this court, though for a time it felt trammelled by some English decisions. The difference of opinion has arisen from taking such acts to have been founded on different reasons. <em>Perhaps no one of </em>the reasons for their enactment was the sole one. They can be supported by many reasons. They seem to me however to have their binding force from the power of <em>the </em>legislature: to <em>he </em>imperative in all cases within their letter, and inoperative, with a very few exceptions, on all cases not within their letter. One of these exceptions is, that where the adverse possession would bar a right of the plaintiff, if he once had such right, to the land itself, it could also bar a right to an easement or an appurtenance united to land\u2014this, provided there has been a possession and use adverse to and inconsistent with such right, or appurtenance, for twenty-one years, a right of way or of water; and the like may remain dormant for a long time, and not be lost, if from the nature of the <em>right and the </em>contract it is apparent that it was not contemplated <em>that the </em>owner of such right should exercise it at an early period, and if the other party has done nothing inconsistent with the existence of such right, as in <em>Butz </em>v. <em>Ihrie, </em>(1 <em>Rawle, </em>218.)</p>\n<p id=\"b130-9\">Where a right has been granted, or reserved, on a conveyance of land, and nothing to show that it was expected or intended that the right should be exercised immediately, ,but on the contrary, that it was to be at the pleasure of the party owning such right, to exercise it at such future time as might suit his interest or convenience,; it will not generally be lost by non user for twenty-one years. <em>Nitzel </em>v. <em>Paschall, </em>(3 <em>Rawle, </em>82.) But if the other party does acts inconsistent with and in denial of such right, it will be otherwise; as if a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>man grants twenty-five feet of front on one of the streets of this city, retaining the title to the adjoining land, and at the same time grants a right to an alley four feet wide, between the lot sold and that retained, expressly reserving the right to build under and over the said alley. Now the grantor is not bound to build at all, and though he does not for more than twenty-one years, his right' to build under and over the alley is not gone ; but if his vendee of the twenty-five feet should cover those four feet by his building, the whole right of the vendor to those four feet would be gone by the limitation of twenty-one years, unless suit was brought within that time. In the case before us, when- the tract of Coombe was divided into eleven lots by his executor, it was apparent that except lot No. 1 at one end, and No. 11 at the other end, no road touched these intermediate lots; and a lane was proposed in the terms of sale and in the deeds, to be formed by cutting 20 feet from the end of each <em>lot; </em>and if different persons had purchased, such a lane would have been immediately necessary; but it happened that he under whom Nace claimed, purchased No. 11, with a road along side of it, and Yeakle the plaintiff purchased the other 10 lots, the house being on No. 1, and a road past it: a lane through the intermediate lots became unnecessary to the two purchasers. If nothing more had occurred, I do not say twenty-one years would have put an end to either party\u2019s right to a lane; but he under whom Nace (the* defendant) claims, immediately enclosed his lot, and has had two fences across, where this lane would have been for 30 years; and during all that time has been cultivating the land over which the lane must have passed. This was either a direct denial of the plaintiff\u2019s right to a lane, or a possession adverse to his claim of one: twenty-one years adverse possession would have barred his right to the land itself, though he had a deed for it; and twenty-one years\u2019 occupation adverse to the easement, and inconsistent with it, bars the right to a way.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
