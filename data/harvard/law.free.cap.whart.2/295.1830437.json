The estate not being quite sufficient for this dividend, the executor has advanced out of his private funds, nearly two thousand dollars, as will appear by the last account. It remains to be inquired, whether the distribution which has been made, is correct. _</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b297-11\">_ The only person who makes any objection to the distribution, is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>Daniel Man, who alleges that he' has a subsisting demand against the estate, upon which he is entitled to a dividend. His claim, as submitted to your auditors, is founded on six promissory notes, drawn by the testator in favour of Joshua &amp; Thomas Gilpin, and by them indorsed in blank.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b298-6\">No. 1 dated 8 month, 25th, 1821, at two months for $457 10</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AD0\">2 \u201c 7 \u201c 13th, \u201c five \u201c 806 10</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AlQ\">3 \u201c 9 \u00ab 18th, \u201c three \u201c 430</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Asy\">4 \u201c9 \u201c ' .18th, \u201c three 510</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AFG\">5 \u201c 7 \u201c 23d, \u201c five \u201c '650</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Alq\">6 \u201c 8 \u00ab 16th, \u201c six \u201c 802 12</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b298-12\">All these notes fell due after the decease of the testator, and were protested at maturity for non-payment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b298-13\">Mr. Sergeant.on behalf of the executor, stated that these notes had always been disputed; that no claim had ever been made under them, till the year 1828, when payment was refused; that an action was brought upon them in the District Court, for the city and county of Philadelphia, on the 6th of December, 1828, to which action the executor, on the 7th of October, 1831, pleaded the statute of limitations, which plea had not yet been replied to, and that the action was still pending.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b298-14\">Mr. Wheeler, on the part of Daniel Man, contended that the plea of the statute of limitations, could not be interposed as a bar to the claim, because the executor is a trustee for the creditors. In support of his position, he cited and relied upon the case of <em>Johnston </em>v. <em>Humphreys, </em>(14 <em>Serg. &lt;\u00a7\u2022 Rawle, </em>394.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b298-15\">Your auditors are of opinion, that' the case before them does not come within the principle of that decision. The right of an ex\u00e9cutor to plead the statute of limitations against a person, - claiming as a creditor of the estate, has never been questioned. The executor owes it to the distributees, (and where the estate, as in the present instance, is insolvent, to the creditors,) to plead the act of limitations against claims of which he has reason to suspect the validity. The doubt has been, whether, in such a case, the other creditors might not compel the executor to plead the statute contrary to his own inclination. <em>Case of George Smith\u2019s Estate, (Ashmead\u2019s Reports, </em>352.) In this case the statute had not commenced running at the testator\u2019s death, but in the opinion of your auditors, that circumstance does not affect the question. As the claimant will have an opportunity of taking the opinion of the court upon the matter, and as they have stated in this report, all the material facts upon which he relies, your auditors do not conceive it necessary to go into a full discussion of the question of law, which has been raised. Consider- - ing the plea set up on the part of the executor as a complete bar to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>the recovery of the claim, your auditors report that Daniel Man is not entitled to any dividend, and that the distribution already-made by the executor is correct, and should be.confirmed by the Court.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b299-6\">On the coming in of the auditors\u2019 report, exceptions were filed on the part of Daniel Man; and after argument, the Orphans\u2019,Court overruled the exceptions, on the 17th of September,. 1836, the following opinion being delivered by Judge J. R. Jones.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b299-7\"><em>\u201c </em>The case before us presents a single question, whether an executor can in equity plead the statute of limitations, in bar of a claim which falls due after the death of his decedent.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b299-8\">That an executor is in equity treated as \u00e1 trustee for persons interested in the distributive succession of his testator, cannot be doubted. That a trustee in some cases,'cannot plead the statute of limitations is indisputable. That all cases of trust are not exempt from the bar, is equally clear.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b299-9\">The first step in this case is to discriminate between trusts barred by the statute and such as are not; to settle some practical <em>criteria </em>for testing the general applicancy of the statute to trusts.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b299-10\">The early principles are exceedingly vague. In some authorities we find the position, that <em>trusts in general, </em>in others that <em>direct trusts </em>are not barred by the statute. But these general expressions-were soon qualified. Modern cases gradually narrowed the limits of the doctrine, and at length have defined it with precision. It would be labour lost to follow step by step, the long and tortuous series of cases down to <em>Kane </em>v. <em>Bhodgood, </em>and <em>Murray </em>v. <em>Koster, </em>in which the final results are accurately developed, and to <em>Apv </em>v. <em>Dries-back, </em>the Pennsylvania case, which recognises those New York cases, and renders them conclusive authority in this court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b299-11\">The principle thus settled, give us these <em>criteria. </em>Trusts not barred by the statute must be</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b299-12\">1. Direct and continuing.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b299-13\">2. Exclusively cognisable in equity.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b299-14\">3. Arising between trustee and <em>cestui que trust.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b299-15\">In explanation of the second of these <em>criteria, </em>the language of Chancellor Kent is very explicit. A party, he lays it down, is barred in equity, whenever he could have brought his action at law, and neglected to do so, until the limitation of the statute intervened.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b299-16\">But clear as the New York cases are, a shadow of doubt seems thrown on their authority by <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Humphreys, </em>(14 <em>Serg. fy Ratole, </em>394,) in ouk own Supreme Court, which has been strenuously pressed for the exceptant. Here the Court say, that the trpsts exempt from the bar are, 1st, direct and continuing. 2d, arising between trustees and <em>cestui que trust; </em>and the other qualification of being exclusively cogrfisable in equity is omitted ; an omission the more remarkable as <em>Kane </em>v. <em>Bloodgood, </em>is cited as authority. Whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number><em>Johnson </em>v. Humphreys, be irreconcileable with the New York cases need not be particularly investigated, since those cases are conclusively authenticated by the subsequent authority of <em>App </em>v. <em>Dreisback, </em>(2 <em>Rawle.)</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b300-6\"><em>The </em>second of these <em>criteria, </em>applied'as a test, settles <em>the </em>question before us. The exceptant\u2019s claim is not a trust exclusively cognisable in equity, it is in fact primarily and properly enforceable at common law. This court takes no cognizance of such claims as the present, except indirectly and from necessity. The proper forum is a common law court. But, says the exceptant, there is a statutory restriction on a creditor\u2019s power of enforcing his claim in a common law court, and thus, that the present case is brought even within the rule we lay down. That partial restriction was enacted in 1834, (35 sec. act 24 Feb. p. 80,) long subsequent to the exceptant\u2019s claim; and in the present case assuredly does not operate, whatever may be its general effect ,\\ which we are not now required to consider.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b300-7\">The exceptant\u2019s claim not being one of those trusts which are beyond the pale of the common law, and exclusively cognizable in equity, is thus barred by the statute of limitations. Whether in any case where the existence of the relation of trustee and <em>cestui que trust, </em>is part of the subject-matter of controversy, as it is here, the statute would not bar, we need not examine; the question being settled on the second of our tests, without the necessity of recurring to the third.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b300-8\">In this case the exceptions are dismissed, and the report of the auditor confirmed.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b300-9\">An appeal was taken to this court by Daniel Man.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b300-10\">Mr. <em>Wheeler, </em>for the appellant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A0qT\">contended that the claim of Man ought to have been admitted. The essential fact (he said,) was that the notes fell due after the .testator\u2019s death. There is a clause in the will providing for the payment of debts. .The act of limitations is applicable only to the common law courts. The statute only runs-after death, when it had begun to run in the lifetime. The form of pleading shows this. 2 <em>Chitty\u2019s Plead. </em>423. <em>Fritz </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>(1 <em>Wharton\u2019s Rep. </em>66.) 1 <em>Schoale &amp; Lefroy, </em>109. The act does not apply, because at the time the \"notes fell due the fund was in the hands of a trustee. <em>Johnson v. Humphreys, </em>(14 <em>Serg &amp; Rawle, </em>394.) <em>Lyon v. Marclay, </em>(1 <em>Watts, </em>275.) <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>M\u2018Gaw, </em>(2 <em>Watts, </em>161.) <em>Power </em>v. <em>Hollman, </em>(2 <em>Watts, </em>221.) It is true that in <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Porter, </em>(1 <em>Binn. </em>209,) it was decided, that when,a debt is once barred, it is not revived by a clause in a will directing the payment of just debts; but here the debt never was barred. 2 <em>Ves. &amp; Beames, </em>275. <em>Blanchard on Lim. </em>137. <em>Lovelass on Wills, </em>313, note 7, (11th <em>ed.)

It is the executor, and not the- court, that administers the assets. The remedy is not in equity but at law ; and the personal representative of the decedent is, for purposes of personal recourse, entitled to trial by jury, and every other constitutional advantage which might have been insisted on by him whom he represents. The Orphans\u2019 Court has doubtless power to make distribution, but not among creditors. It can be made only when the debts, are paid and the accounts settled; consequently only when there is no creditor to claim. We pretend not to determine whether the debt or contract is barred by the statute of limitations\u2014that is \u00e1 matter to be determined in an action at law\u2014at present we say no more than that the creditor could not interfere with the distribution in the Orphans\u2019 Court; and that his exceptions, for that reason only, were properly disregarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-8\">Report of the auditor, and decree of the court affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
