It is believed, that the remedy by attachment has been progressively enlarged since the act of 1705, and that the reasons which led to the adoption of this remedy, in ordinary cases, apply with equal force to the case of a legacy. Lands have been held to be attachable. So an attachment will lie for \u2022damages arising <em>ex contractu. </em>The object of the legislature was to subject all property to payment of debts; and this court has, for \u2022the purpose of effecting the ends of justice, given a liberal construction to the act. <em>Bushel </em>v. <em>The Commonwealth Ins. Co. </em>(15 <em>Serg. &amp; Rawle, </em>173.) The words \u201cgoods and chattels\u201d may embrace a legacy. <em>Dowdel </em>v. <em>Ham, </em>(2 <em>Watts, </em>64.) 3 <em>Thomas\u2019s Co.

The custom of London and the law of Massachusetts respecting trustee process, differ in many respects from our law of foreign attachment, and are not to be considered as authority. 2 <em>Bac. Abr. </em>259-60; <em>Picket </em>v. <em>Swan, </em>(4 <em>Mason, </em>443) Here the executors must' be taken from their answers to the third and fourth interrogatories to have assented to the legacies. In <em>Ross </em>v. <em>M\u2018Kinley, </em>(2 <em>Rawle, </em>227,) Judge Rogers suggests that a conditional verdict might be given, which would protect the executors ; or the court might stay proceedings in the <em>scire facias, </em>until security, in nature of a refunding bond, was given.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b337-6\">Mr. <em>G. M. Wharton </em>and Mr. <em>F. W. Hubbell </em>for the defendants in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b337-7\">The attachment in this case was taken out immediately after the proof of the will; and the question'now to be decided is, whether the legacy was attachabl\u00e9 on the 1st of October, 1832; which was one year and eight months before the answers to the interrogatories. We contend that a legacy cannot be attached for the debt of the legatee; or, at all events, not until the assent of the executor has been given. In 1705, when the attachment law was passed, an action could not be brought for a legacy. It was not considered in the light of <em>goods. Bastard </em>v. <em>Stukely, </em>(2 <em>Levinz, </em>209; S. C. 1 <em>Thos. Jones\u2019 Rep. </em>130.) <em>Paramour v. Yardley, (Plow. </em>539.) 4 <em>Co. Rep. </em>28, <em>b.; Toller on Executors, </em>309, 311. By our act for the recovery of legacies, a year must elapse before suit can be brought; and a refunding bond must be given. How is this to be given by the attaching creditor <em>1 </em>Suppose a refunding bond given, and then the defendant comes in and disproves the debt, what becomes of the bond ? Are the sureties of the plaintiff to become sureties of the defendant <em>1 </em>Has the court a right to alter the rul\u00e9 with respect to legatees\u2014to give a creditor a greater right than .the legatee ? By the attachment, an executor is involved in litigation without his consent. Suppose the executor pleads <em>nulla bona </em>to <em>the scirefacias, </em>is he to be made personally liable ? Has the court a right to take away from the executor the several writs by which he is protected\u2014 as the <em>fieri facias de bonis testaloris, </em>&amp;c. In England the point has been expressly decided. 1 <em>Rolle\u2019s Abr. </em>551; <em>Noy, </em>115; 1 <em>Chan. Cas. </em>257; 2 <em>Bac. Abr. </em>259; <em>Sergeant on Attachments, </em>86, 193.

It is considered here as property, since it passes under the insolvent laws. There are many things which are not the subject of execution, and yet are property. <em>6th Report on the Civil Code, </em>p. 33. The acts relating to attachments are mere outlines. The courts and the practice have made them valuable, <em>M\u2018Clenachan </em>v. <em>M\u2018Curty, </em>(1 <em>Dall. </em>376.) <em>Sugden, </em>496; 4 <em>Co. Rep. </em>65; <em>Laveacre </em>v. <em>Blight, (Cowper, </em>352.) The act of 1772 differs from that of 1742, in adding the action on the case to debt, <em>detinue, </em>&amp;c. There is a series of cases, in W'hich the court have held that they will mould the forms of actions to effect the purposes of justice. This is a case strongly calling for the exercise of this power. The case of <em>Fisher </em>v. <em>Consequa, </em>(2 <em>Wash. C. C. Rep. </em>384,) proves that our attachment law is applied more liberally than that of England or Massachusetts. The case in 4th <em>Halsted </em>is not applicable in this state, because there is no remedy for the recovery of legacies in the common law courts of that state\u2014the method of proceeding being in chancery.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b336-12\"> 1 <em>Miles, </em>186. <em>(Shewell v. Keen.)</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b338-6\">The opinion of the Court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b338-7\">Sergeant, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AeE\">In every case in which a determination has taken place on the question whether a foreign attachment would lie for a legacy, it has been held that it would not; and some of these cases have occurred under statutory regulations on the subject, very similar to our own. Various reasons have been given for coming to this result; and a little reflection convinces us that'the proceedings by foreign attachment, cannot be applied to the case of a legacy, without great inconvenience and manifest incongruity.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-8\">A pecuniary legacy is not a debt. It is a sum of money, payable by the executor or administrator out of the estate of the decedent, if sufficient assets remain in his hands, after discharging the debts of the deceased and other responsibilities, and provided the legatee previously complies with certain requisites, prescribed by the acts of assembly. Generally it is not recoverable at law, but is subjected to chancery jurisdiction, which treats the executor as trustee of the estate for the benefit of those interested in it. In Pennsylvania, a legacy is recoverable in a common law court, by the act of 1772, there being no court of chancery; but that act gives peculiar powers to the court; and the executor\u2019s duty is still in nature of a trust, in relation to legacies ; and they are payable only on the performance of certain conditions by the. legatee. He must make a previous demand, and must tender or file a refunding bond, not so much for the protection of the executor, as for the benefit of creditors who may subsequently establish claims against the estate. If a foreign attachment be permitted, by which the assets in the hands of the executor are to be eventually appropriated to the attaching creditor, the legacy may be recoverable without demand, and witnout filing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>a refunding bond. For the legatee would not be expected to give such bond, and there exists no power in the court to compel the attaching creditor to do it, or to authorise the executor to receive it from him. If the refunding bond could be given, an extraordinary result might follow. The plaintiff, before the payment of the money by the garnishee, always gives security to restore the amount received, if within a year and a day the defendant should appear to disprove the debt. If within the year and day, the defendant issue his <em>scire facias ad disprobandum debitum, </em>and succeeds, and recovers back his legacy, he then gets it without giving any refunding bond; and the plaintiff may be compelled, in the event of new debts against the estate being afterwards established, to pay the amount a second time on his refunding bond. Such consequences evince that the process by foreign attachment cannot be harmonised with the acts of assembly concerning the recovery of legacies.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">Another circumstance of weight is, that an executor or administrator is, to a certain extent, an officer of the law, clothed with a trust to be performed under prescribed regulations. . It would tend to distract and embarrass these officers, if, in addition to the ordinary duties which the law imposes, of themselves often multiplied, arduous and responsible, they were drawn into conflicts created by the interposition of creditors of legatees, and compelled to withhold payment of legacies, without suit; to suspend indefinitely the settlement of estates; to attend, perhaps, to numerous rival attachments; to answer interrogatories on oath, and to be put to trouble and expense for the benefit of third persons, no way connected with the estate, nor within the duties of their trust. It has been decided that money in the hands of a prothonotary or sheriff cannot be intercepted by a creditor of the party, entitled to it; but it must be paid over to himself only. I <em>DalL </em>354. The case of an executoi or administrator is analogous to that of a sheriff or prothonotary. He has the fund in his hands as an officer or trustee authorised by law; and if a new party were allowed to levy on it by attachment, there would be no end of disputes and lawsuits; and no business could be certain of ever being brought to a close within a reasonable time. Itis of great importance to the interests of heirs, creditors and legatees, that the affairs of a decedent\u2019s estate be kept as simple and distinct as possible; that its concerns be speedily closed, and the estate adjusted. It is moreover settled, that an executor cannot be sued as defendant, in an attachment by a creditor of the testator, and the goods of the testator attached to recover the debt. 2 <em>Dali. </em>73. The reason is, that the estate of the testator ought to come into the hands of the executor, that he may administer it according to law : and pay the debts if the assets suffice; and they ought not to be stopped, and the executor subjected to new responsibilities, by pro-; ceedings in attachment. These reasons apply with, equal force to the attempt to make an executor garnishee, for the purpose of pay<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>ing out of the assets in his hands, the debt due to a creditor of a legatee. These funds must travel only in the path pointed out by the laws relating to decedents\u2019 estates in their various branches and cannot be diverted out of that path, without interfering with salutary regulations, and violating some of the most important provisions-of the acts of assembly.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
