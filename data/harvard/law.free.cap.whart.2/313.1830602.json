I then went to the door and looked across . the street, and saw Mr. Steever and Mr. Beehler at the corner of Race and Third streets, at Sellers &amp; Davis\u2019s store. I then went down to the corner, and saw Steever and Beehler standing both on the pavement, near the sill of the door. Mr. Beehler was shaking his fist about; appeared to be very much agitated, and calling him ugly names; among the rest, he said, \u201c you are a liar and swindler, and a damned villain, and you have conspired with others to cheat me out of my money;\u201d these are the very words; at the same time shaking his fist under his nose; I thought he was going to strike him; appeared to be in a great passion; he was talking constantly; he was near to Steever when he spoke the words to him ; had his sleeves rolled up; I stood there about five minutes; he called him those names twice in my hearing, whilst I was there; I then left, and went to my shop, which is the fifth door above Race, in Third street; there were people collected together, from thirty to fifty, some from Mayland\u2019s factory, opposite ; I could not hear any thing Steever said, if he spoke; when Beehler advanced, Steever retreated ; Beehler and Steever were both there when I left; when I left, the croud had not'separated; Mr. Sellers appeared to be trying ta pacify Beehler; I could not hear what he said.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b315-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>The plaintiff\u2019s counsel then asked the following question of the witness ; \u201c What is the general size and build of Mr. Beehler\u2019s person 1\u201d to which the defendant\u2019s counsel objected; but the learned judge allowed the question to be put, and the defendant\u2019s counsel excepted. The witness answered, \u201c Beehler is a very stout man, stout built; you will not see many men as stout. It was between seven and eight in the morning; the two houses adjoining me are fifteen feet each, and Mayland\u2019s factory is three times that, I suppose; my house is the third house, and fifth door; a cartway between the tavern; I was sitting in the room back of my shop when I heard the noise ; it was very warm weather; I did not know whose voice it was, till I went to the door, and I,found it was Beehler\u2019s voice; I think Steever was at this time a clerk in Mr. Richards\u2019 compting house; Beehler is a sugar-refiner; carried on business in Ann, above Vine street, and below Third; it is a large establishment.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b315-6\">A witness named Halliday testified to the same words as the preceding witness; and in answer to a \u00a1similar question, which was also excepted to, said, \u201c Beehler was about six feet high, and strong or stout in proportion.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b315-7\">Another witness named Sellers, swore, that as near as he could recollect, Beehler said, \u201c I <em>believe </em>you are conspiring with others, to cheat me out of my money.\u201d On his cross-examination he said, \u201c I took the reference of the words spoken by Beehler at our store, to be to some money transactions between him and M\u2018Caraher; he referred to some debt due by M'Carahef to him; I did not know of any assignment of M'Caraher preferring Richards; Beehler is in Europe now ; Beehler appeared, at the time in the store, to listen to what I said; did not speak in that tone of voice as before.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b315-8\">The plaintiff\u2019s testimony being closed, the defendant\u2019s counsel offered a witness named Eckstein, to .prove that the defendant was in the habit of signing notes for the accommodation of Alexander M'Caraher; that it was' through th,e influence of the plaintiff that this was done, and that the notes wei\u2019e unpaid at the time of M\u2018Caraher\u2019s failure; which evidence was \u25a0 objected to on the other side, and rejected by the court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b315-9\">The defendant also produced as a witness Mark Richards, who, after\" testifying to matters not important now, was asked the following questions:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b315-10\">\u201c Had you any conversation, the day before the occurrence at Sellers and Davis\u2019s store, with Beehler respecting the assignment of A.

M\u2018Caraher, dated July 19th, 1833, to Mark-Richards and E. Vansyclde; the plaintiff having been stated to be the confidential clerk of the former; to show such a disposition of M'Caraher\u2019s property by the assignment, as was injurious to the defendant and likely to produce loss to him; and that Mark Richards the assignee, was so largely preferred in the assignment as a creditor, as probably to absorb the funds of the estate. The learned judge however, refused to permit this evidence to be given.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b316-10\">The defendant\u2019s counsel again offered the testimony of Eckstein, and proposed to put the question to Richards, before mentioned, but the court again rejected them.

That if the jury believe from the evidence,'that the words used by the defendant were as stated by Mr. Sellers\u2014\u201c I believe you are conspiring with others to cheat me out of my money\u201d\u2014these words are not actionable, and there is a variance between the words as laid and as proved, and the verdict ought to be for the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b316-15\">4. That if the jury believe, from the evidence, that the words were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>Spoken by the defendant in the heat of passion, and merely as general abuse, and were neither intended by him, nor understood by the bystanders as charging the plaintiff with having committed an indictable offence, but referred merely to the defendant\u2019s belief that the plaintiff was privy to, or had influenced Mr. M'Caraher, in making his assignment, to provide for Mark Richards, and others, creditors, in preference to the debt due to defendant for accommodation notes lent by him to M'Caxaher, then the verdict ought to be for the defendant.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b317-6\">The judge charged the jury as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b317-7\">\u201c This is an action on the case for slanderous words. The plaintiff alleges in his declaration that the defendant falsely and maliciously uttered the following words, addressed to the plaintiff:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b317-8\">\u00a3 You are a villain and a swindler, and you conspired with others to cheat me.\u2019 And in another count\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b317-9\">\u2018You are a. damned villain and a syvindler, and you conspired with others to cheat and swindle me out of my money.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b317-10\">One witness, Mr. Vantine, says he twice heard the words, \u2018You are a liar and swindler, and a damned villain, and you conspired with others to cheat me out of my money.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b317-11\">Another witness, Mr. Halliday, testifies to the words, \u2018 You are a liar, a damned scoundrel, and a swindler, and you conspired with others to cheat me,\u2019 as nearly as the witness could recollect; and the witness added that the defendant repeated the charge more than once.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b317-12\">So far it would seem that the words as laid were substantially and almost literally proved; and if the jury adopt as true the testimony of these witnesses, this I understand is not denied.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b317-13\">Another witness, Mr. Sellers, testified to the words, as far as he could recollect them, \u201cYou are a liar, and I believe you are conspiring with others to cheat me out of my money.\u201d Throwing out of view for a moment the words swindler and villain, which are in the plaintiff\u2019s declaration, and which by themselves would be mere words of opprobium, in which the vulgar are privileged to indulge; the other words as laid, \u2018 you conspired with others to. cheat me out of my money,\u2019 are actionable in themselves; conspiracy to cheat being a crime involving moral turpitude, and punishable by indictment, and the imputation of such a crime being actionable, (3 <em>Serg. dr Rawle, </em>258.) No damages can be given except for the actionable words. 'This being the <em>prima facie </em>view of the case, the other words come into operation as mere epithets, having no other effect than as tending to show the state of mind in which the actionable words were uttered. In this view they may possibly aggravate the character of the actionable words.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b317-14\">These remarks answer the first and second of the points submitted in writing by the defendant\u2019s counsel, to be charged upon by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>court, excepting so much of the second point as relates to the heat of passion, and an offer of an apology; in regard to which I will say a few words presently.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b318-6\">The only other witness examined was Mr. Richards, who was called by the defendant\u2019s counsel. The jury will recollect his testimony with that of the other witnesses.\u2014From th'e whole, the jury have an opportunity of forming a judgment in regard to the situation and station of both plaintiff and defendant, and in relation to the time, place, and circumstances under which the words were uttered, and also to the matter of the alleged offer of an apology. The plaintiff claims damages. Before making a brief remark or two on that topic, which I shall do without encroaching upon the province of the jury, let us look to the grounds of the defence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b318-7\">1. On legal grounds\u2014It is said \u2018 that if the jury believe from the evidence that the words were spoken by the defendant in the heat of passion, and merely as general abuse, and were neither intended by him, nor understood by the bystanders, as charging the plaintiff with having committed an indictable offence; but referred merely to the defendant\u2019s belief that the plaintiff was privy to, or had influenced M'Caraher in making his assignment to provide for Mark Richards and other creditors in preference to' the debt due to the plaintiff, for accommodation notes lent by him to M\u2018Caraher\u2014then the verdict ought to be for the defendant.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b318-8\">The first branch of this position ending with the words \u201c indictable offence,\u201d is true as a general proposition; but some explanation becomes necessary. Where the words are actionable of themselves, it must be satisfactorily shown to the jury that they were not used and not understood in an offensive sense as imputing the crime. It is not enough that a single witness who may have happened to know more of the parties than others of the individuals who heard the words, now at the time of the trial, gives his opinion as to their meaning.' The true question is what was understood at the time, and what might have been reasonably understood by the hearers. The words should be understood in court as \u201eail mankind would understand them. They ought not to be taken on the trial differently from what all mankind would understand them out of court. (3 <em>Serg. Sg Raiole, </em>261.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b318-9\">Again, as to the second branch of the defendant\u2019s fourth point. If there had been an express reference in words to a specific pecuniary loss, and an allegation of cheating by the party alone, the whole charge explaining itself at the instant, and showing no indictable offence whatever, no action would lie. But the case might be different where a defendant, referring to such a pecuniary transaction, made the charge of a conspiracy with others to cheat; for that which would not be criminal, if done by the individual, might become so, if performed by means \u2022 of a conspiracy or combination with others. Further than this\u2014where the words in themselves <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>unexplained at the time of their being uttered, do impute an indictable crime of moral turpitude, there is no principle of law which will authorise the Court to s\u00e1y, that the .verdict ought to be for the defendant. And .as to an independent extraneous interpretation, or glossary of the words, the modern and true rule is thus stated by Judge Duncan in the case of <em>Eckert </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>(10 <em>Serg. S\u00a1- Rawle, </em>64):\u2014\u201c That no subsequent explanation given on the trial, showing a reference to a transaction not indictable; can shield the slanderer from the whole texture of these' words,intrinsically considered as they ought to be, and explained as they appeai'ed to be by the time and manner of. speaking them.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b319-6\">The third point submitted by the defendant, will now be better understood than if noticed before the fourth. It is for the jury to determine, whether that to which each, of the three witnesses testifies, is true, without contradiction by any other witness; or whether there is a contradiction. It is in evidence that the denunciations made by the defendant, were repeated.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b319-7\">The jury are hot restrained from the conclusion, that each of the varied forms of language was used. If that view be adopted, and it is the view upon which the plaintiff\u2019s counsel argued the cause, then the answer to this third point becomes unimportant. Should a different view, however, be taken, and the jury concur in the suggestion, that the only words used were those stated by Mr. Sellers, then it would be for the jury, considering the time, place, and circumstances of the utterance, and the tone and manner of the defendant, to decide whether the criminal charge laid in the declaration, was made by the defendant or not. The mere form of expression would not require the Court, in point of rigid law, to exclude the case from the consideration of the jury. It would not be for the Court to pronounce peremptorily, that there was such a variance as to require a verdict for the defendant. This point was proposed to me in writing, just as I was about to charge the jury; and though it may have been before adverted to by counsel, yet it is due to candour, that I should add, that I did not understand the cause to have been argued on either side, as if this point were material, or as if a charge on it was expected..</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b319-8\">With the principles before stated in view, the jury will decide, whether their verdict shall be for the plaintiff, or for the defendant. If for the plaintiff, then there remains a very important part of your duty. The question of damages is for the jury. If the plaintiff has sustained an actual injury, the jury-may .award him compensation. Outrage to the plaintiff\u2019s feelings and peace of mind may be considered. Trouble, inconvenience, expenses, loss of time in seeking redress, may be taken into the account. The jury may sometimes give damages to deter a defendant, and'others from similar misconduct, by correcting the defendant, especially in cases of perseverance in the slander or justification of it. This should be done cautiously, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>however, and only when strong circumstances demand it. The jury must exercise a prudent judgment in each case. But the defendant says here, that the damages, (if any) should not be high; and this brings us to the defence secondly in point of fact.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b320-6\">[The judge here referred to the testimony of Mr. Sellers and Mr. Richards upon the subject of an offer of a compromise, and stated the view which counsel on each side had taken of this evidence, and then proceeded as follows:]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b320-7\">\u201c Certainly an outrage persevered in, deserves more severe reprehension than one retracted; expressions of sorrow, and an offer to compromise, ought to be carefully weighed by the'jury. Though they do not wipe out the offence, and relieve the party entirely from the claim' for damages, yet it is the province of the jury to say, what effect is to be given to.-the circumstances. While, therefore, I would advise the jury to regard this matter as worthy of serious consideration, with a view to a mitigation of the damages, yet the precise degree of strength which belongs to it, is for their own determination.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b320-8\">The violent temper of the defendant has been referred to on both sides. As to general bad temper, the law will not recognize it as a justification. The jury will judge of the effect of the testimony, after having heard all the arguments of counsel.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b320-9\">Again, the defendant\u2019s counsel alleged, that the defendant spoke the words in the heat of passion, and while smarting under a severe pecuniary loss. The connexion between defendant and M\u2018Caraher .\u2014between M\u2018Caraher and Mr. Richards\u2014and between Mr. Richards and plaintiff, has been referred to. The connexion between the plaintiff and defendant, as to any business, is not very clear; but these matters have been adverted to.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b320-10\">The law makes allowance for human frailty, for a sudden heat of passion, and provocation; but it will not permit a justification of a slander, nor even a mitigation of damages upon a principle of revenge. If a man has provocation, and has time for reflection, it is his duty to reflect. It is agreed on all hands, that nothing occurred that morning, even as to M\u2018Caraher. The law will not extend its indulgence for a violation of its obligations to him, who sleeps upon his provocation. It gives one charged with slander, an opportunity of pleading a justification, and making good his words. If he will not take that course, the provocation must be fresh to entitle him to the favour of the law. Then, as to the amount of damages. Though this point belongs peculiarly to the jury, yet I may remark, that if you find for'the plaintiff', you should look well to -your verdict.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b320-11\">While it does justice to the plaintiff and the public, let me advise you to take care, that it does not show passion, or prejudice, or undue excitement; let it be such as you can reflect upon with satis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>faction hereafter; such as will not be regarded as startling or extravagant, but will exhibit calmness, and the exercise of a sound discretion and judgment. As to the alleged and reputed wealth of the defendant, let me caution you not to'be misled on this point. It is not often that there is danger of too small a verdict in cases of this description. Where a decided and actual-injury has been inflicted, and so perseveringly pursued, as to require unequivocal punishment, and there is no other mode of inflicting it, than by the assessment of damages, a wide scope may be taken by the jury. Each case, however, should be graduated by its own peculiar circumstances. If the jury can do full justice to the pl\u00e1intiff and to the community, without taking so wide a range, then the mere fact of a man\u2019s possessing property, whether inherited, or earned by his own industry, ought not to induce a jury to do more than that full justice, looking to the whole case, requires. A poor man, it is true, may feel a given verdict more than a rich one; and a measure of damages, which may be sufficient to do what is right in regard to one, may be insufficient in regard to the other. But after all, the justice of each case must be the object to be obtained by the verdict of the jury.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b321-6\">The jury found for the plaintiff-, with $2550 damages; and the defendant removed the record to this Court, and assigned the following \u00e9rrors:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b321-7\">1. \u201cBecause the court below erred in admitting evidence of the general size and build of the defendant below, and of what family, and how many children the plaintiff below had.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b321-8\">2.

Again, that the defendant\u2019s counsel allege that the defendant spoke the words in the heat of passion, and while smarting under a severe pecuniary loss; and after observing that the connexion between the plaintiff and defendant, as to any business, is not very clear, the judge said that th\u2019e__ law makes allowance for human frailty; for a sudden heat of passion and provocation; but it will not permit a justification of a slander, nor even a mitigation of damages, upon a principle of revenge; that the law' will not extend its indulgence to him who sleeps upon his provocation; the provocation must be fresh, to entitle him to the favour of the law.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b323-9\">11.

It is difficult to perceive what connection evidence of this description can have with an action for slanderous words; and accordingly it is admit- &gt; ted, that, in general, such evidence is inadmissible. But it is said this case forms an exception ; but I have been unable to discover any thing peculiar in its circumstances, which exempts it from the general rule. The evidence is not merely irrelevant, <em>but, </em>from its character, it is calculated to be highly prejudicial to the defendant, by influencing the feelings and passions of the jury, by highly coloured representations of the herculean strength and gigantic size of the defendant. In the hands of skilful and eloquent advocates, we may readily conceive, that topics of this kind may be wielded with great effect. If evidence of the size and general <em>build </em>of the defendant\u2019s person may be admitted, for the same reason we must enter into a comparative estimate of the bone, sinew and muscle of the respective parties, with a view to test their relative strength, in an action of slander. And if such testimony may be received to measure the damages, there can be no reason assigned why evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>dence of the size and strength of the plaintiff may not be admitted in mitigation; and this would lead to an inquiry, totally foreign to the issue, and tending, in its results, to mislead and distract the jury. It is difficult to conceive that words spoken may be more or less slanderous or obnoxious to small or excessive damages, merely from the relative strength of the plaintiff and defendant. If this was an action for assault and battery, some reasons might be offered that might avail the plaintiff; but in this action, it seems to me, there was most manifest error in- the admission of this evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">The last branch of the first error has not been sustained. It is clearly competent to show' the number of children, and the state of the plaintiff\u2019s family.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-7\">The defendant also complains of the rejection of the testimony, embraced in the second, third and fourth errors. That may be included under one head, and was in substance this. The defendant offered to prove that he was in the habit of signing notes for the accommodation of a certain A. M'Caraher, through the influence of Steever, the plaintiff; that the notes were renewed by the same influence; that they remained unpaid at maturity; and this maturity occurred after the assignment of M'Caraher had been made; that the defendant had a conversation with Mark Richards, one of the assignees of M'Caraher, respecting the assignment, within forty-eight hours of the time the words were spoken, in which he expressed his dissatisfaction with the order in which the creditors were preferred in the assignment; that he, Beehler, was a creditor of A. M'Caraher; and that in the assignment, which was also offered in evidence,- dated the 16th of July, 1836, to Mark Richards and E. Vansyckel, such a disposition was made of the property of A. M\u2018Caraher, as was injurious to the defendant, and of such a character, as probably to produce loss to him. And that M. Richards, the assignee, who was the uncle and employer of Steever as his confidential clerk, was so largely preferred therein as a creditor, as probably to absorb the funds of the estate; that the debt of Mr. Richards was contracted in the ordinary course of dealing; notwithstanding which, he was preferred over the defendant, who <em>signed the notes of- M\u2018Carahei', </em>without value, for his accommodation ; that the conversation, in which the words laid in the declaration, were spoken, had relation to the assignment; and that, under the influence of his losses, he used these words at an accidental meeting between him and the plaintiff', Steever.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-8\">The evidence was offered, as is expressly stated in the bill of exceptions, in mitigation of damages, and not in justification of the slanderous words.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-9\">It was opposed, as is now stated, on two grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-10\">1. Because there was no notice given, under the thirty-sixth rule of the District Court, which requires ten days notice of the special matter intended to be offered on the trial under the general issue-</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>2. Because the facts thus offered, cannot be given in evidence, in \u2022 mitigation of damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">As to the first, it is by no means clear that this objection was taken at the trial; but if it had been, it cannot avail the plaintiff. The rule, in actions of slander, notwithstanding some loose expressions to the contrary, is, that any defenc\u00e9, which does not amount to a justification, may be given in evidence under the general issue, in mitigation of damages. A justification must either be pleaded specially, or, according to a very general practice in this state, may be given in evidence under the general issue, on notice given to the opposite party, ten days before the trial. The only effect of the rule in the District Court would seem to be, to substitute notice* of a justification, rather than put the party to the trouble of drawing out. a formal special - plea. But it was not intended to require that notice should be given, of facts which go in mitigation of damages merely.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-7\">But can the evidence be given in mitigation of damages ?\u2014is the next question.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-8\">Malice is of the very essence of an action of slander, and as a general rule, any thing which shows the existence of the malice on the one hand, and the want of it on the other, or 'the degree and extent of the malice, may be laid before the jury, and has a material bearing as the case may be, either on the maintenance of the suit, or on the amount of the damages. And such allowances have been made for the infirmities of our nature, that in <em>Knobel </em>v. <em>Fuller, </em>(2 <em>Peake Ev. 287,) </em>which case is referred to, and approved in <em>.Morris </em>v. <em>Duane, </em>it was ruled, that the defendant may in mitigation of dam ages, prove, on the general issue, such facts and circumstances, as show a ground of suspicion, not amounting to actual proof of the plaintiff\u2019s guilt. If a person truly believes, although mistaken in point of fact, that he has a good cause, and in a moment of irritation and passion makes a criminal charge against another, he is surely not as culpable as where the accusation is made without any reason, either actual or supposed. The malice is much greater in the one case than the other, and the party is liable to be mulcted in damages to a much greater extent; for the actual injury which the plaintiff\u2019s character has suffered, is not the only criterion of damages, but the jury may take into their estimate the wickedness of the plaintiff in making an accusation against his neighbour without any cause-for suspicion. On the same principle it has been decided, that a person may give in evidence that another told what he related ; and this even when the slander is spoken without reference to the informer. <em>Kennedy </em>v. <em>(Gregory, </em>1 <em>Hinn. </em>90.) And in <em>Morris </em>v. <em>Duane, </em>in a note to 1 <em>Bin. </em>90, Chief Justice Tilghman, at Nisi Prius, pennitted the defendant to prove in an action for a libel, a writing purporting to be the copy of an anonymous letter, which from certain marks on the back of it, was inferred to have been in the possession of B. F. Bache, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>upon his death to have come to the defendant, who succeeded him as editor of the Aurora, in which the libel was published. \u201c The effect, - (says the Chief Justice,) of any evidence which a defendant may offer is _with the jury, the. competency with the court. The question in this case is, whether the defendant is entitled to offer to the jury this letter, with the explanations for any legal purpose connected-with the cause. It certainly cannot be offered to prove the plea of not guilty, and it is no legal justification. But still, is it not material? Can it be that like damages should be given against two defendants, one of whom received his information from such sources as were entitled to a certain degree of credit, while the other devised it of his own wicked imagination ? I think it cannot. Such evidence certainly goes to the degree of malice, and must weigh with the jury according to the circumstances which attended it. Whether these circumstances are such as ought in .reason to mitigate the damages, they will determine.\u201d This was not a hasty decision of the Chief Justice, and has been repeatedly recognised in subsequent cases. Its bearing on this case is most obvious. The evidence was offered in mitigation of damages, by showing the degree and extent of the defendant\u2019s malice; for it is some extenuation of his conduct when we consider the occasion of his speaking the slanderous words', the transaction to which he alluded, and of which he had so much reason to complain; the connexion which Steever had with the parties to it, and the share he had in the transaction; the influence he exerted in procuring the accommodation of Beehler for M'Carahex\u2019, and in acting in some .measure as his general agent in procuring accommodations for him. Nor can the same blame be attached to him as if he had devised the charge without cause or shadow of suspicion. Although thex-e is no proof of the actual participation of Steever in procuring the assignment, or of his agency in inducing M'Caraher, over whom Beehler naturally thought he had some influence, to prefer his uncle and employer, for a debt which was not particularly mexitorious, in exclusion of Beehler who was an endorser, and as such, usually preferx\u2019ed in such assignment; yet there were circumstances connected with the transaction, which might have caused suspicion of some extraordinary influence in producing such a state of things, in a mind even more enlightened than the defendant\u2019s appears to have been.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">But it is said that forty-eight hours had intervened between the conversation and the speaking of the slanderous words, and this is a sufficient reason for excluding this testimony, and for this position the plaintiff relies on <em>Avery </em>v. <em>Ray, </em>(1 <em>Mass. Rep. </em>12.) <em>Lee v. Woolsey, </em>(19 <em>John. </em>329.) <em>Cushman </em>v. <em>Waddell, </em>(1 <em>Baldw. </em>57.) But these were all cases of actions for assault and battery, which depend on different principles. If the defendant had cause, to believe in the truth of the charge he made against the defendant, of what conse^ quence is it so far as affects the competency of his testimony, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>whether he heard the facts which were the grounds of his belief, forty-eight hours before, or at the very moment of speaking the slanderous words. This objection was not thought of either in <em>Kennedy </em>v. <em>Gregory, </em>or in <em>Morris v. Duane; </em>nor has it ever been alleged as a reason for excluding such testimony, that the information on which the defendant relied, was communicated to him some time before the speaking of the offensive words. In actions for an assault and battery, it may be conceded that the defendant'in mitigation of damages, is confined to provocations which immediately precede the assault. It must be so recent, as to afford a fair presumption that the violence was committed under the influence, and during the continuance of excited feeling and passion, and this on a principle of policy which should repress, an'd not countenance revengeful feeling, nor in any way encourage an appeal to force and violence. But it is said, that this doctrine as to time was applied to slander in <em>Beardsley </em>v. <em>Maynard, </em>(4 <em>Wendell, </em>337.) In that case it was decided, that in an action for a libel, the defendant cannot give in evidence other libels published of him by the plaintiff, not distinctly relating to the same subject; and that the publication of a libel three days previous to the publication of the defendant\u2019s libel against the plaintiff will not be received in evidence, in palliation of the offence, on the ground of provocation. When the passions have had time to cool, redress can only be had by a resort to the legal tribunals of the country; for no man whose rights are protected by the law, should be the avenger of his own wrong. And where the previous publication has no no relation to the libel, it should not be received' to mitigate the damages. Nor is there any excuse for a libeller, that the other party has before libelled him. But the evidence here was not offered on the ground of provocation, but to show that Beehler had some reason to believe in the truth of the epithets he applied to the plaintiff, as affecting the degree of malice in uttering the slanderous words, so as to explain the transaction to which he alluded. In no case that I have seen, has it been thought material, on the question of the competency of the testimony, that the party has received his erroneous impression, either recently, or at a remote period from the time the charge is made. In <em>Beardsly </em>v. <em>Lathrop, </em>the principle is recognised, that if a connection can be traced between the publication of the one as an answer to the other, the former publication is evidence. The testimony was excluded, expressly because no such connection had been discovered. And in <em>Hotchkiss </em>v. <em>Lathrop, </em>in an action for a libel, it was permitted to give in evidence a former publication by the plaintiff, to which the <em>libel </em>was an answer, to explain the subject-matter, occasion, and intent of the defendant\u2019s publication. And for the same reason we think this should have been received, as it seems to explain the transaction, the occasion and reason of the offensive charge. It is also a circumstance of some weight, that the conduct of which the plaintiff complains, occurred <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>at an accidental meeting, and that immediately after Beehler being convinced of the impropriety of his conduct, he acknowledged his error, and tendered all the amends in his power.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">In answer to the errors assigned to the charge: We have examined the charge in connection with the errors, and we can discover nothing, of which the defendant can justly complain; nor is there any thing which has been alleged as error, which requires particular notice, except the answer of the court to one of the defendant\u2019s points. The court was requested to charge the jury, that if they believe that the words spoken were, \u201c I believe you are conspiring with others to cheat me out of my money,\u201d they are not actionable; and that there is a variance between the words laid and proved, and that the verdict ought to be in favour of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-7\">It cannot be urged, with any prospect of success, that the words, \u201c I believe you are conspiring with others to cheat me out of my money,\u201d are not actionable. The question has been too often settled, now to admit of doubt. Nor was this point pressed, but the latter branch of the proposition was insisted on. This is a point, not without plausibility, but yet it. seems tq be settled by authority. In actions of slander, it is only necessary to prove, in substance, the words laid in the declaration; and for the defendant to <em>say, </em>\u201c I believe you are conspiring with others to cheat me,\u201d amounts, in substance, to a positive charge, that you are conspiring with others to cheat me. It is equal to a positive averment of'guilt; for a man only avers a thing because he is cognisant of it. And this point was so decided in <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Meller, </em>(8 <em>Johns. Rep. </em>74.) The words laid in the declaration were, \u201c Tina Miller has stole my watch, and Polly Miller has concealed it for her.\u201d The proof at the trial was, that the defendant said that his watch had been stolen from him in. the plaintiff's bar-room, and that he had reason to believe that Tina Miller took it, and that her mother concealed it. It was held by the court that the words, in substance, were the same, and supported the declaration. The court say, \u201cthe defendant made a positive charge that his watch had been stolen in the bar of the plaintiff, and he added, that he had reason to believe that Tina Miller had taken it, and that her mother had concealed it. The assertion that he had reason to believe that the one took, and the other concealed it, is equivalent to the charge that the one stole, and the other concealed it.\u201d <em>Oldham </em>v. <em>Peck, </em>(2 <em>Bl. Rep. </em>961,) is to the same point, where the court held, that to say, \u201c I am thoroughly convinced that you are guilty,\u201d is equal to a positive averment of guilt. Besides, so much depends upon the manner in which the words are spoke, that the court were right in saying to the jury; that it was not for them to pronounce peremptorily that there was such a variance as to require a verdict for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-8\">Judgment rev\u00e9rsed, and a <em>venire de novo </em>awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
