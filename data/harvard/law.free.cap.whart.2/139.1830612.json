The defendants also gave parol evidence in relation to the same matter. The Judge charged the jury, that the plaintiff could not recover unless it had been expressly agreed, that the defendant, Jacoby, took the premises subject to the matters specified in th,e award; and unless the reservation was omitted to be inserted in the deed of conveyance by the mistake of the scrivener.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b144-7\">The jury found \u201c that at the time when Samuel Jacoby purchased the 24 acres 48 perches of land mentioned in the declaration, he agreed to take the same subject to the sums of money, articles and services, enumerated as well in the last will and testament of Jacob Kauffman, deceased, as in the award of the arbitrators, mentioned in the plaintiff\u2019s declaration, to be paid, rendered, don\u00e9 and performed, by Jacob Kauffman, the devisee therein named; and that in the deed executed by Charles Kramer and wife to Samuel Jacoby, the articles enumerated in the said award, were omitted to be enumerated and reserved by the mistake of the scrivener. If, under these facts, the Court shall be of opinion that the plaintiff is entitled to recover, then the jury find for the plaintiff, $142 28 to be levied of the said tract of 24 acres 48 perches of land so conveyed to him, the said Samuel Jacoby, as mentioned in the plaintiff\u2019s declaration, together with costs of suit.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AyH\">The defendant\u2019s counsel moved for a new trial, and in arrest of judgment, and filed several reasons. After argument, the Court, on the 22d.of August, 1836, discharged the motion for a new trial, and ordered judgment to be entered for the defendants. Judge Banks, (who succeeded Judge Mallery, as President of the Courts of Common Pleas of that district,) delivered the judgment of the Court as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b144-9\">\u201c It would appear from the declaration, that the suit was brought to recover the money and articles to which the plaintiff was entitled by the will, as well as the money and services -and articles she was entitled to from Jacob under the award. It is now stated, that the recovery was had only for the money and articles the plaintiff was entitled to under the award. The calculation which was sent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>out with the jury, has been shown us, from which it would appear that this was so.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b145-6\">Many reasons have been urged for a new trial, and as many in arrest of judgment. We will not notice them all, as the individual who delivers this opinion, was not on the bench when the trial was had. His opinion will be formed chiefly from an examination of the record. The suit is brought against all the defendants, as if this claim was a charge on the land mentioned in the declaration.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b145-7\">The claim now made, does not arise' out of the will of the testator, but out of the award. By the terms- of the award, the money, services, &amp;c. are not made a charge upon the land; neither are they made a charge by the terms of their agreement to abide by the award; nor is it laid in the declaration, that they were a charge upon the land, by virtue of the award or of the agreement; nor is it found to be the fact by the verdict.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b145-8\">By the award, John and Jacob are to procure and deliver the articles, &amp;c. at their joint costs and charges in part, and each to perform certain things, and deliver certain articles individually, and each to pay a certain sum of money. There is nothing in this award, that would make these things &lt;a charge upon the land.*</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b145-9\">There is in the agreement, a stipulation that the parties fully $gree to the award, and it then proceeds, \u201c we do hereby covenant, grant and agree for ourselves, our heirs, executors and administrators, that we will abide by the same; and faithfully fulfil the same in all and every its various parts, to the full intent and meaning thereof.\u201d ...</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b145-10\">This agreement does not make the matters mentioned in the award, a charge upon the land; nor is it very easy to see how the executors can be made parties to this suit. It does not arise out of the will. The claim is not founded on the will. This agreement is individually for <em>themselves </em>and <em>their executors, </em>&amp;c. and <em>heirs. </em>Each one- binds himself; and the executors do not bind the estate of their testator for the performance of thjs award, nor do we know that they could do so. The claim m.ay afterwards have been made a charge on the land by Jacob Kauffman, Kramer, and Jacoby, but that would not entitle the plaintiff to judgment , in this case. If that were so, the executors would not be in any .way chargeable, nor would the estate of their testator be in any manner subject to the payment of the sum now claimed. \u25a0 Npr is the estate of old Jacob Kauffman at all liable to the payment of the money, or for the perfonnance of the matters contained in this award. This claim so far as regards the executors of Jacob Kauffman, deceased, is not a charge upon the land either by the will of their testator, by law or by agreement. How then can judgment be entered in this case for the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b145-11\">The case of <em>Pidcoch </em>v. <em>Bye, </em>is cited as -an authority; but that case is unlike this. There the sum claimed was a charge upon the land <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>by express act of assembly, and the defendant had agreed to pay it. It is also urged upon us, that by this case it is decided that if a plaintiff has a cause of action, he may recover it in any form of suit. We do not think that any such principle is established by that case. In actions of this kind, the plaintiff must- have a good cause of action against the persons sued, or he cannot get judgment against them. There must be legal parties to the suit; and unless the action lies against all the defendants, the plaintiff cannot recover. It was. not necessary to join the executors in this case. The cause was not to be reached through them, -nor could it be reached through them for this claim. We think that the action cannot be maintained in its present form, and that on the facts found by the jury, the plaintiff is not entitled to judgment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b146-6\">The Court therefore enter judgment for the defendants.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b146-7\">The plaintiff sued out this writ of error, and assigned the following errors:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b146-8\">\u201c 1. That on a motion in arrest of judgment, the Court could not enter a- judgment for the defe\u00f1dant, but could only arrest the judgment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b146-9\"><em>2. </em>That there was no sufficient cause shown, for arresting <em>the </em>judgment, or entering a judgment for the defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b146-10\">3.

The Court ought not.to have entered judgment for the defendant, on the motion in arrest of judgment. The effect of this would be to debar the plaintiff from another suit, which ought not to be the case, when judgment is arrested.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b146-13\"><em>2. The </em>jury liave found that Jacoby <em>took </em>the-land <em>subject io </em>the lien. - We did not ask to charge his person, but the land. It may be that the award was not a lien <em>per se, </em>though it .was recorded; but if the parties agreed to take subject to it, it became a lien. In point of fact, the plaintiff was a party to the submission. It is true, that in <em>Bower </em>v. <em>Oyster, </em>(3 <em>Penn. Rep. </em>239,) it was held that there cannot be a valid parol mortgage; but the case of <em>Rickert </em>v. <em>Madeira, </em>(1 <em>Rawle, </em>327,) shows that that doctrine is to be taken with some allowance. In <em>Long </em>v. <em>Long, </em>(1 <em>Watts, </em>268,) Judge Kennedy says, \u201c whether a lien can in any case be created by a parol contract upon real estate, is a question as I conceive, not altogether necessary to be decided here.\u201d It is sufficient, if there was a contract between the parties, that the property should be taken subject to the lien. <em>Fickes </em>v. <em>Ersick, </em>(2 <em>Rawle, </em>166.) <em>Ripple </em>v. <em>Ripple, </em>(1 <em>Rawle, </em>386.) <em>Stackpole </em>v. <em>Glassford, </em>(16 <em>Serg. &amp; Rawle, </em>163.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b147-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>3. It is settled, that in an action to recover a .legacy charged on land', the executor of the testator and the devisee and terretenants ought to be made defendants. <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Furer, </em>(4 <em>Serg. &amp; Rawle, </em>213). <em>Gause </em>v. <em>Wiley, (Id. </em>523.) 1 <em>Chitty\u2019s Pleadings, </em>497. The declaration in this case was framed upon the model of that in the case of <em>Patton </em>v. <em>McCauley, </em>referred to in <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Furer. </em>In chancery, the same persons would be made parties. <em>Blake\u2019s Chan. </em>59. 2 <em>Madd. Chan. </em>180. Are not all persons interested brought in here? The case of <em>Rees </em>v. <em>Moore, </em>(13 <em>Serg. &amp; Rawle, </em>436), relied upon on the other side, seems to have been overruled in <em>Pidcock </em>v. <em>Bye, </em>(3 <em>Rawle, </em>183.) As to the liability of the executors, as such, <em>Macbeath </em>v. <em>Haldiman, </em>(1 <em>Term Rep. </em>172.) <em>Onwhyn v. Wolsey, (Id. </em>672.) <em>Hodgdon </em>v. <em>Dexter, </em>(1 <em>Crunch, </em>345.) 4 <em>Am. Law Journal, </em>129, &amp;c. The only remedy in this case, under our peculiar law, was by <em>assumpsit. Debt </em>would not lie. The deed to Jacoby must be taken to have been .reformed by the parol evidence.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b147-6\">Miv <em>Hepburn </em>for the defendant in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A3Y\">The law is settled that a terretenant is liable by reason of his possession alone. The declaration avers that Jacoby was liable by reason of the award alone, which never was a lien. The recording of it did not give it greater validity or effect. The parol evidence was offered to establish a lien which the case of <em>Bowers </em>v. <em>Oyster </em>shows cannot exist. <em>Rees </em>v. <em>Moore, </em>(13 <em>Serg. &amp; Rawle, </em>436,) shows' -the impropriety of joining the executors. Where the charge was not created by the testator, they cannot be made liable.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b147-7\">The opinion of the Court was delivered by'</p>\n<author id=\"b147-8\">Hustoit, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AUY\">It is admitted that nothing was said in the court below on the subject of the judgment in favour of the defendant; and it is agreed, that on a motion in arrest of judgment, there cannot be a judgment entered for the defendant: this would preclude the plaintiff from another suit. It is true, that, generally, on a special verdict, there is a judgment for one party or the other; but in this case, and generally where the cause goes off on a motion in arrest of judgment, or for reasons depending on a mistake in declaration, or in the form of action, the judgment is only arrested; and the plaintiff may bring another action.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-9\">The different courts in England, from whence this state came as a colony, have distributed the administration of justice among them in such manner, that certain claims have been, for a long time, made in a court of chancery; and certain portions of them were, at one time, in the Ecclesiastical Court, and then, for a period, in the courts of common law, which last courts assumed jurisdicdiction to compel the payment of legacies, while the ecclesiastical courts were suspended under the commonwealth. Soon after the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>restoration of the monarchy, the chancery became the more usual tribunal, and has, at length, superseded the jurisdiction of the com-&lt; mon law courts as to legacies charged on land, except, perhaps, in' cases of express promise to pay, in consequence of some consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">We have neither ecclesiastical courts nor a court of chancery; and it could not have been tolerated, that so large a class of claims as legacies were ever irrecoverable in this colony or state. As our decisions, in former times, were not reported, we must speak with some doubt as to the mode, but certainly legacies were recovered in this colony long before the act of 1772, for the more easy recovery of legacies. The forms of declarations are in the manuscript book of forms of Tench Francis, Attorney General, more than twenty years before 1772. The act of 1772 enables the person, to whom any legacy, or bequest of any sum of money, or other goods or chattels has been made, to recover from the executors or administrators, with the will annexed, if there are sufficient assets, by action on the case, debt, detinue, or account-render, as the case may require, &amp;c.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-7\">This did not in terms embrace the case of a legacy charged on the land devised to some particular person, subject to such legacy; for executors, unless there was a deficiency of assets to pay debts, could not touch lands so devised. In such cases, it was at one time the practice to bring ejectment against the devisee of the land so charged, and recover and deliver the possession to the devisee, until the- legacy was paid by perception of rents and profits. This was as far from any .thing known to the practice of courts of common law in England, as it was unsatisfactory, in most cases, do both legatee and devisee. Lands, of which only a small part was in cultivation, would not, by rents and profits, pay a few hundred dollars in a long time. The devisee was put out of possession\u2014the legatee could not raise his money by a sale\u2014and the remedy-required to be reconsidered, and, if possible, a better one discovered.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-8\">The case of <em>Patton </em>v. <em>M\u2018Cauley, </em>in 1782, occurred in Lancaster, while the late Judge Duncan was a student in the office of Mr. Yeates,, afterwards Judge Yeates. And in 1807, the suit of <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Furer </em>was commenced, but not finally decided until . 1818; (4 <em>Serg. &amp; Rawle, </em>213.) There the judgment was reversed, because it was personal against the defendants, and not as it should have been, a judgment to recover the money out of the land devised, subject to the payment of such legacy. In the same book, page' 509, in <em>Gause </em>v. <em>Wiley, </em>this matter came again under the consideration of this Court, and the doctrine was again fully discussed at the bar and by the several judges, and again it was decided that the executors ought to be made parties; because, if there remained debts of the testator unpaid, and no other fund, they must first be satisfied, even out of land specifically <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>devised, before a legacy charged on such land; and further, that the judgment ought to be, to levy the legacy out of the' land devised subject to the payment of it, and not general, against the defendants personally. <em>From </em>that time, debt for-a legacy charged on land, has been generally brought as directed- in' those cases; but cases have occurred, when debt could not be brought according to the principles peculiar to that action. The will under consideration is an example. The testator devises to his widow a certain sum of money to be paid annually, but he also devises six bushels of rye, two bushels of wheat, three bushels of buckwheat and four bushels of Indian corn, and fifty pounds of \u201cgood fat pork.\u201d And such wills are ' very common in this state. Would debt lie for these several kinds of grain, and this pork 1 No. Are such devises not to be recovered in this state <em>1 </em>If ejectment is brought, is the widow to hold a farm, producing much grain, and keep all to herself, or become tenant to the devisee for all above what is devised to her ? But these quantities of grain she is to receive annually, as long as she lives; when in possession by a recovery in ejectment, she is soon paid for time past, and must then restore the possession. But default is made and she recovers possession again, and so on to the end of her life. Such a remedy would be ruinous to both parties, and satisfactory to neither. Again, this year wheat is two dollars per bushel, and other grain, at a proportionally high price; and suppose it is not paid to her, and she brings ejectment and recovers, and when in possession, wheat and other grain sell for half the. present price; is she to take bushel for bushel, or as much wheat, &amp;c., as would indemnify her for being compelled to purchase this year\u2014and if so, how are the relative prices and proportions to be settled <em>1</em></p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">If there is a difference any where as to the obligatory force of judgments on land, depending on whether the debt was originally evidenced by writing under seal, or-depending on <em>parol </em>proof, that difference don\u2019t exist here ; a judgment creditor can levy on, and sell the lands of his debtor, without regard to what was the nature of his debt before it became a judgment; and this is also the case whether the <em>form of </em>action was covenant, or debt, or assumpsit, or case, or trespass: and I can see no reason why this court should not support against the executors and devisee, debt or case, or any other action suited to the facts of the case; and on suggesting in any one of these actions all the facts which constitute the claim a lien on a specific tract of land, and claiming a judgment to be levied on that land, recover in one form of action as well as in another. The same reasons which induced the court to sustain <em>debt on </em>a money <em>legacy \u25a0 </em>charged on land, will be found to exist and to apply, with at least equal force, to induce them to support <em>case </em>,to recover a quantity of grain, or wood, or meat, or all of them, charged to be delivered annually to .a devisee, by a person to whom a particular tract is given.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>In the case of <em>Long </em>v. <em>Long, </em>(1 <em>Watts, </em>269,) Judge Kennedy has shown that debt against, what is called the pernor of the profits, was well known to the common law. Perhaps in modern times in England, such claims are now brought in chancery. We have no court of chancery: we have sustained actions at law, for which there was no precedent, to attain justice in a clear case, as <em>Lang </em>v. <em>Keppele, </em>&amp;c. <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Furer, </em>has been cited; and in <em>Pidcock </em>v. <em>Bye, </em>(3 <em>Rawle, </em>183,) before the Chief Justice at a Circuit Court, and before this court, on appeal, <em>assumpsit </em>was supported, and a special judgment to be levied on the lands agreed to be charged, was entered; possibly debt could have been sustained in that case, which was for a precise sum of money. But in this case debt would not lie for grain, meat, hay, and firewood; and perhaps it is in a special action, such as this, that a recovery must always be had, for nondelivery of such articles as are here sued for.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">But it is said that this suit is for articles agreed on at a family settlement and consultation of friends, to be paid to the widow, beyond what is directed to be delivered to her by the will, and that if the plaintiff succeeds, it will be 'establishing a lien by parol, and that this cannot be done in Pennsylvania. It is better in the decision of causes, to try and decide the case before us: the jury have found that the defendant is in possession of the lands which are to be affected by this judgment, at the time when he purchased, expressly subject to the articles directed to be delivered to the widow by the will, and also subject to the payment and delivery to her of the articles specified in the award, and agreed to by the whole family; and that these lat- . ter were omitted to be inserted in the deed by the mistake of the scrivener. Now it may be that an innocent purchaser, for valuable consideration,-actually paid before notice of this award and agreement, might hold this twenty-four acres discharged from this incumbrance, and yet that the land may be subject to it in the hands of Jacoby, who not only had notice of it, but actually agreed to pay and deliver the matters which are the subject of this suit. I say the law and the justice of the case might be different in the case of an innocent and <em>bona fide </em>purchaser. I do not pretend in this case to designate what facts or circumstances would produce such results.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-7\">This court is of opinion that under the finding of the jury in this case, and in this form of action, judgment ought to have been entered for the plaintiff; the sum found and costs to be levied of the said tract of twenty-four acres forty-eight perches of land so conveyed to him, as stated in the declaration. Beyond all question he got the land on paying a less sum in cash, on account of these matters charged on it, and which he agreed to pay: to refuse is unjust in him. The judgment will not affect any of the- other defendants; because it is' in truth, a judgment, not against any person, but against a specific tract of land. Several of the cases cited, prove that this may be done, and was done in'England, in actions of debt against the terretenant or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>pernor of profits. To change the forms of proceeding in actions at law, when applied to the purposes known and sanctioned, is one thing; to extend the forms of law, when wernre exercising chancery-powers, or when we are compelled Jo apply those forms to new cases, is a different thing. If it were worth while to make a careful examination, one could find that judgments conditional and uncertain as to the time when they were to take effect, and uncertain whether ever they were to take effect, were once known to the common-law. The action of <em>warranlia charts </em>could be brought and tried, and judgment obtained before tfie plaintiffs were injured, or even threatened with a suit. The judgment was not for a specified sum of money, nor for money at all; nor for any specific quantity of land, or particular parcel of land; but to recover from the defendant lands of equal value with those warranted loffhe plaintiff; and nothing could be done on this judgment until the plaintiff was evicted from the lands warranted to him by the defendant. There will be found more than one case, in which in a suit against several who sever in their pleas, a judgment will be had against one and not against the others; one instance is a suit by a creditor of' a testator against two executors, who severally plead that each has administered all the assets which came to his hand, and the plaintiff replies to each that he has wasted the assets; the issues may be found one for the plaintiff, and the other executor may have a verdict. The alarm which is pretended when a conditional verdict is sustained, or a judgment given, which is to affect only the person or the-property which ought to pay, does not disturb me. In a few years all the applications of the common law forms to new cases, from <em>Lang </em>v. <em>Keppele </em>to this time, have met the approbation of those learned in the law, and honest in principle; and perhaps no case called for the interference and assistance of the court more imperiously, than those very common provisions for widows, of grain, wood, meat, &amp;c. charged on particular tracts.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">\u2019 Judgment reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
