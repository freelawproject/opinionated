The legislature never contemplated authorising the legatee to exercise any acts of ownership over it. If he can pass it by will made before the death of the testator, so he can assign it by deed\u2014and it may become liable to creditors\u2014and in the case of real estate to his widow\u2019s dower. The only way to avoid these difficulties, is to hold that the children of a deceased legatee, take directly from the testator. They take by <em>substitution </em>for the devisee, and not <em>under </em>or <em>through </em>him. Thomas Prichett merely devised <em>his </em>estate, and his will can operate on no real estate that he did not hold at the time. 1 <em>Kent\u2019s Comm. </em>461, 463, and 1 <em>Roper on Legacies, </em>320, were cited.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b48-6\">Mr. Smith.\u2014The defendant, as executor and trustee under the will of Thomas Prichett, is desirous of obtaining the decision of the Court, to justify him in his settlement of the estate. It is material to ascertain if the property is to be considered as passing <em>through </em>Thomas Prichett. The words in the act, \u201c with like effect as if the devisee or legatee had survived the testator,\u201d must be allowed some meaning. They cannot be rejected altogether. In <em>Earnest </em>v. <em>Earnest, </em>(5 <em>Rawle, </em>213,) it was held that a debt due by a deceased parent might be set off against a claim by grand-children, to a distributive share of the estate accruing to them in right of such parent. The construction of the act contended for on the part of the plaintiff, would prevent a similar result in the case of a legacy to a deceased child, and would produce inequality in cases of advancement. Then as to the expressions in the will of Elizabeth Prichett, \u201c the moneys due or to become due, from the estate of her grand-motherthey do not necessarily refer to the proceeds of the real estate, since Anna Catherine Prichett left also personal estate.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b48-7\">The opinion of the Court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b48-8\">Sergeant, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A4L\">It is impossible to entertain a doubt on the proper construction of this act of assembly, when its object is considered. The rule of law was, that by the death of a devisee or legatee in-the lifetime of the testator, the devise or legacy lapsed; and those who might have derived a benefit under him, in case he had survived the testator, were deprived of it. When such person left issue, and the testator was their lineal ancestor, it seemed hard that the accident of death, perhaps a few days before the testator, should cut them off: especially when others participated in the bounty of the testator, whilst his own descendants were excluded by misfortune alone. The act therefore declares that there shall be no lapse; but the devise or legacy shall be good and available in favour of such issue, with like effect as if such devisee or legatee had survived the testator. It <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>operates to remove the disability under which the issue laboured, of setting up a derivative title under one in whom no primitive title had vested; or in other words, makes the devisee or legatee a stock or <em>propositus, </em>not to own or control the right, but to transmit it: so that the issue take wh\u00e1t he otherwise would have taken. If the doctrine of the defendants were admitted, so far from conferring a benefit on the issue, it would enable the devisee or legatee, to defeat them by his will, or other disposition of the property. And it may be also remarked, that if a benefit was contemplated to the devisee or legatee himself, there is no reason why it should not be conferred on him, whether he had issue or not. It is plain, that it was for the issue only, the law was passed. They are to take with like effect, as if the devisee or legatee had survived the testator; but it is only they who are to take. And where there are no issue, a lapse occurs as before.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">Another question is made, viz. on that clause in the will of E, B. Prichett, by which she bequeaths the moneys due or to become due, from the estate of her grandmother.' Certain real estate had belonged to her grandmother, \u00c1. C. Prichett, and after her decease was the subject of proceedings in partition, and was sold and converted into money, before E. B. Prichett made this will: and the question is, whether the clause embraced these moneys. The language used, seems correctly to describe the fund: for as E. B. Pritchett then owned it, it consisted of moneys due or to become due from or out of the estate of her grandmother. We have no- ground laid before us to limit the construction, so as to exclude that which it is presumed the testator knew was the nature of the fund at the time of making her will, and which the words employed sufficiently describe.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-7\">Judgment for plaintiff, when the amount is ascertained according to the case .stated.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
