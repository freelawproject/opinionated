The plaintiff failing to appear according to notice, but asking delay by letter, his guilt was voted by twenty-five to four, and his expulsion pronounced by twenty-three to six.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b310-12\">The plaintiff brought the suit before Alderman Laws, on the 12th of November, 1834, claiming one week\u2019s benefits due in August, and four weeks\u2019 benefits accrued from the 15th of October to the 12,th of November, 1834.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b311-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>The cause was tried in the Court below on the 17th of November, 1835, and a verdict given for the plaintiff for $20. The defence rested upon two grounds. 1st, That as, to so much of the benefits as were due prior to expulsion, the society had agreeably to the by-law, ordered them not to be paid, from which order there could be no appeal. 2d, That as to so much as were claimed as having accrued since the expulsion, the claimant had 'no right whatever, having ceased to be a member.. In the course.of the trial, the court, notwithstanding the -objections of the defendants\u2019 counsel, admitted evidence to invalidate the decisions and expulsion passed by the society. '</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b311-5\">A verdict having been given for\u2019the plaintiff pursuant to the charge of the Court, the defendants took a writ of error, and filed the following specifications:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b311-6\">1. \u201cIn admitting evidence to disprove the charge as to the intemperate habits, in which the sickness or the complaint of the defendant originated: the same being objected to by the counsel for the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b311-7\">2. In admitting evidence to prove that the facts stated in the certificate of Dr. Shaffer, were untrue ; the same being also objected to.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b311-8\">3. In charging the jury, that if the defendant was expelled from the society for an alleged cause which was not founded in truth, he was entitled to recover benefits, alleged to have become due even after the date of such expulsion, in this form of action.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b311-9\">4. In charging the jury, that if the defendant had been illegally expelled, he might treat his expulsion as a nullity, and could maintain this suit for dues without a previous application to the Supreme Court for a restoration to his corporate rights.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b311-10\">5. In charging the jury that although the society, under its constitution and by-laws, had a right, at the meeting of the 6th of September 1834, to receive the charge of the stewards against the defendant, and by a Vote founded on that chai\u2019ge, to direct that the defendant should not receive further benefits; yet, if in this action that charge be proved to have been untrue, the defendant may recover, and he need not wait for the society to reverse their direction.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b311-11\">Mr. <em>Dallas, </em>for the plaintiffs in error,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aqg\">argued that the exclusive right of judging of the delinquency of'the members, was vested in the corporation; that the only question was, whether the forms prescribed by the by-laws, had been complied with; and that this being satisfactorily shown, the court below had no jurisdiction. He cited 1 <em>Bl. Comm. </em>468. <em>Taverner\u2019s Case, (Sir T. Raymond, </em>446.) <em>Phillips </em>v. <em>Berry, </em>(1 <em>Ld.

Rep. </em>517.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b312-6\">The opinion of the Court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b312-7\">Gibson, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AV1\">It is said that by-laws preclusive of recourse to remedies beyond the corporate jurisdiction, are void, because the general legislative power only is adequate to take from the citizen his remedy by due course of law. But a corporator may undoubtedly surrender, by consent, a matter of common right, which he could not be deprived of by a by-law that had not received his assent. <em>Astley </em>v. <em>The Whitstable Company, </em>(17 <em>Ves. </em>323.) Independently of implied assent, the by-laws of a municipal corporation, within the scope of its corporate powers, bind, by statutory or prescriptive force, all who happen to be within the territorial limits of its jurisdiction, whether corporators or strangers. But the by-laws of a private corporation like the present, derive their force from assent, either actual or constructive. How far then did the plaintiff below assent to the jurisdiction of the tribunal, by which he was disfranchised <em>1</em></p>\n<p id=\"b312-8\">There are points of limitation to the general presumption of assent to things, done at a regular meeting; for that the presumption has no place where the act was otherwise illegal, is collectible from <em>Slee </em>v. <em>Bloom, </em>(19 <em>Johns. </em>456.) The matter here, however, depends not' merely on presumption of assent to a by-law, but on the charter to which the plaintiff expressly assented at his initiation; and he is consequently bound by every thing done in accordance with it. The seventh article declares that the stewards, doubting the inability of a beneficiary to pursue his business, may have him examined by a physician, whose report is to be conclusive; and the twentieth declares, that being served with a copy of the charge, and summoned to appear at the next stated meeting, he shall, on trial and conviction by two-thirds, be dealt with agreeably to the by-laws. These ordain, that no member receive benefits for a disease induced 'by debauchery, drunkenness or offensive fighting; but that a culprit in any of these predicaments, being reported by the stewards to the next stated meeting, be expelled. The plaintiff was thus reported, and charged by the stewards with inducement of disease by intoxication; and at the next stated meeting, the\u2019 hearing of the charge and the answer submitted, was adjourned. At the third meeting, though re-summoned, he failed to appear, but sent a written request for a further postponement; whereupon he was convicted and expelled by the requisite majority. Into the regularity of these proceedings, it is not permitted us to look. The sentence of the society, acting in a judicial capacity and with undoubted jurisdiction of the subject-matter, is not to be questioned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>collaterally, while it remains unreversed by superior authority. If the plaintiff has been expelled irregularly, he has a remedy by mandamus to restore him; but neither by mandamus nor action, can' the merits of his expulsion be re-examined. He stands convicted by the sentence of a tribunal of his own choice; which, like an award.of arbitrators, concludes him. Even were there not a sentence in the way, payment of his stipendiary allowance could not be enforced by action. The society never consented to expose itself to the costs and vexation of an action for every weekly pittance that might be in arrear. For open disregard of- the prescribed forms of procedure, the remedy' would be by mandamus to the proper organ; but that results from the visitorial power incident to the King\u2019s Bench, which is reserved to this Court by the act of 1722, and which enables it to supervise and correct the abuses of inferior jurisdictions. The remedy by action was therefore misconceived.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
