Phillips, Esq. his attorney, the sum of five hundred dollars, (being the sum awarded for his damages on the opening of Carbon street in the city of Philadelphia,) out of the county stock, and demanded from the said commissioners their warrant upon the treasurer for the said sum, which was refused; the commissioners asserting, they could not draw any warrant for sums not ordered by the county board to be paid. This affiant further saith, that he presented the same order to Geo. W. South, Esq. County Treasurer, and demanded from him payment. The treasurer replied that he could not pay it, though there was more than that amount in the treasury for county purposes.

That there is not in the county treasury at this time, nor w:as there at the time of the application of the relators to them, any funds applicable to the payment of such orders; the whole balance then in the treasury being demanded for current expenses, and otherwise specifically appropriated. The amount actually in the treasury was $56,032 76; the amount due, but not collected from the tax fund of 1836, was $29,700 96; in all $85,733 72. The arrears of taxes of 1836, will not be paid in all probability till the 1st of April 1837. The county are now liable for requisitions under various acts of assembly, exceeding the amount actually in the treasury, and will before the 1st of April, 1837, be liable to requisitions, amounting in all to $101,963 65, leaving a deficit of $16,229 93. On inquiry of the county treasurer, they are satisfied that this statement is correct, and that there can be no change till .the county board shall be convened, and authorise the rate per centum of county tax for the current year. By the act of assembly constituting the county board, the commissioners are prohibited from convoking the board during the sessions of the legislature, and must give ten days previous notice of the time of meeting. It may be assumed therefore, that no means of relief can even be authorised before the 10th or 15th of April, 1837, and that no part of the fund so authorised can be realised and made available, till the 1st of September, 1837. The whole amount of requisitions above stated, $101,963 65, will be called for before the 1st of April, 1837. The estimated deficit on the 1st of September next, is $41,229 93. The commissioners, therefore, have no hesitation in making returns to the rules of your honourable court, that there is no money in the treasury applicable to the payment of damages due to the relators, nor will there be, until the county board shall take such measures for the relief of the county, as to them may seem expedient.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b288-11\">2d. The' commissioners further return, that by the act of 10th of April, 1834, constituting the county board, the power of authorising loans on the credit of the county, is vested exclusively in that body; and by the 38th section of the act of 16th June, 1836, the county board is authorised, when they deem it expedient, in all cases of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>' loans authorised by them, to appropriate the proceeds thereof, and certify the same; and in \u2022 no case shall .any part of the proceeds of said loans be paid out of the county treasury, except under such appropriations. That in pursuance \u00f3f said .authority, the\" county board, at a meeting held on the 15th of July, 1836, (the proceedings of which are made part of this return,) authorised a loan of $440,250, and especially appropriated the proceeds thereof. By reference to these proceedings, it will be seen that $409,195 was to be borrowed forthwith, to-be appropriated in the manner therein specified; and holders of orders for damages in pertain enumerated cases, (not however comprising those of the relators,) were authorised to take certificates of said loan, bearing five per cent, interest, in satisfaction of the said orders. That besides this loan of $409,195, to be forthwith raised, a further loan of $31,055 was authorised, conditioned on the state of facts hereafter to be set forth. The proceeds of this loan were also specifically appropriated, with power of subscription; and among the appropriations thus made of the said conditional loan, was $6,625, to pay damages on M'Ginnis\u2019 court or Leonard street, comprising the claim of Norris Stanley, one of the relators, and $4,850 on Carbon st. comprising the case of Hewett the other relator. The contingency on which this loan was to be authorised, was the following.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b289-6\">By the acts of 3d April, .1804, (4 <em>Smith, </em>198,) and 25th of March, 1805, (4 <em>Smith, </em>232,) regulating the opening of streets, &amp;c. in the City and County, of Philadelphia, after providing for the assessment of damages, it is enacted that unless the same shall be paid within one year next after the return made by the viewers, all such proceedings as aforesaid shall be void and of no effect. More than a year having elapsed from the time of the return of the viewers of damages, in the cases to be settled by the loan of $31,055, without the payment of the damages, in consequence of the want of funds in the county treasury; the County Board deemed it expedient to make the borrowing of that amount conditional on the decisions of your honourable court, either on a case stated, or application for a <em>mandamus </em>on the question arising out of the provisions of the act of assembly first referred to, in the cases in which rules have been taken on your respondents. It appears by the affidavits that in'the case of <em>Carbon street, </em>the report of the viewers in favour of Thomas Hewitt, was made to the Court <em>of </em>Quarter Sessions on the 3d December, 1834, and the certificate of the board was iss\u00fced on the 15th of July, 1836; more than \u2018a year expiring after the return of the viewers withodt payment of the damages ; thus presenting the case contemplated by the board. If on the case thus presented, the court should be of opinion that the lapse of one year under these circumstances has not avoided the proceedings, the relators would be compensated out <em>of the </em>loan which the commissioners would be authorised to raise; if it has, the relator is entitled to no damages from the county.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b290-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>In the case of Leonard street, it appears that owing to some misapprehension unknown to your respondents, the amount to pay damages on Leonard street, was comprised in the loan of $31,055, although a year had not elapsed after the return of the viewers, the return being on the 30th of October, 1835. Still the case being specifically provided for by the certificate, and your respondents having no authority to borrow money, or to appropriate it when borrowed, except according to the certificate, there is no relief in their power.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b290-6\">The commissioners in showing cause why the <em>mandamus </em>in these cases should not issue, have made this detailed return in order to show the court,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b290-7\">1.

M.

This principle was decided very recently in the case of <em>Comm\u2019lth ex rel. Price </em>v. <em>The County Commissioners, </em>(1 <em>Whart. </em>1); and the reasons of it are obvious. The county commissioners are the officers elected by the people, under the laws, to superintend the finances of the county. They /authorise all its expenditures, and are responsible for the faithful and prudent management of the concerns of the county in that respect. If the funds under their control, raised by directions of the county board in whom the authority is vested by law, are not sufficient to meet the claims against t'he treasury, how are they to pay them <em>l </em>Or why should they draw, orders for them <em>l </em>It was decided long since in <em>Comm'lth ex rel. Witmer </em>v. <em>The Commissioners of Lancaster County, </em>that they ought- not to draw orders on an empty treasury; and where the demands exceed the funds, it is an empty treasury as to some of them. Under these circumstances <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>the county commissioners must exercise a sound and just discretion in reserving money to defray the current expenses of the county; because they are of the first importance to the welfare of the public; and they are precluded by law from expending moneys specifically appropriated, otherwise than for their specified objects. This court would not interfere with the exercise of a discretion so plainly proper and necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">But the main point in the present case arises under the loan authorised by the county board, of a certain sum, for the purpose of defraying among other claims, those occasioned by the damages awarded for the opening of Carbon street and Leonard street. This loan was to be raised only in case this court should be of opinion, that under the circumstances, claims such as those of the plaintiffs were valid. The objection is, that the acts of the 3rd of April 1804 and the 25th of March 1805, after prescribing proceedings to be adopted for the laying out and opening streets in the city and part of the county of Philadelphia, provide that \u201c unless the damages shall be paid within one year next after the return made by the viewers, all such proceedings shall be void and of no effect whatsoever and that more than a year has elapsed from the time of the return of the viewers of damages, in cases to be settled by the loan above mentioned, without the payment of the damages, in consequence of the want of funds in the county treasury.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-7\">Where a year has elapsed from the return of-the viewers, without payment of the damages by them assessed, it is too clear to admit of a doubt, that the county commissioners are not bound to pay the damages. These damages are the consideration money for the property of an individual taken as a street for the public use : but if the public cannot thereby acquire a title to the street, the money is not to be paid. That they cannot, is evident: for the act declares that all the proceedings for that purpose shall be void and of no effect. If so, they give no right to open or use it as a street; but the property remains vested in the individual as it was before, free from all liability to be opened as a public highway, without new proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-8\">The public have no other mode of acquiring the right to the land, (without the express or implied consent of the owner,) but by certain prescribed proceedings; and if -those proceedings are annulled and declared to be of no effect, the right of the public never vests. The public would then pay their money without any equivalent. If the property is not transferred to the public, but the individual retains it as before, he cannot compel payment for it. The owner is no wise injured by this result. His property is untouched; for unless the damages are previously paid, the street cannot be opened. The only consequence is, that things remain exactly as they were; and there is no street. Nor ought there to b\u00e9 a street where the funds of the public (whom the county commissioners in this respect represent,) are in such a condition as not to admit of paying within the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>year, without greater public detriment and inconvenience than dispensing with the street. Indeed it would' seem at present that some streets had better be dispensed with than that the expenditure of money from the county treasury should be continued on a scale, which has, Vithin a very few years, involved' the county in debts and responsibilities to near a million of dollars; and which appear by the return in these cases, to be more likely to increase than to diminish, unless great care be taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">Motion denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
