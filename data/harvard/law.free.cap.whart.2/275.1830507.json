The word <em>cost </em>in the singular, means the expense of the jurymen.. The fee-bill, which gives a certain compensation to witnesses, is confined to suits 'in court and befor-e magistrates.

Nothing is said of the costs of witnesses, because it was not intended that there should be witnesses.. The jury are to judge for themselves on- view of the premises, and not by the opinions of witnesses ; who could testify to no more than is apparent to the senses of the viewers. Beside it would give an unreasonable advantage to the petitioner, were he at liberty to swell the costs at pleasure by a cloud of-immaterial witnesses, and without a correspondent risk to himself.
