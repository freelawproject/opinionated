By the third section of this act, they were directed \u201c to make out a fair and accurate draft of the location of this, road, noting thereon the courses and distances as they occur, the improvements passed through, and also the crossing of county and township lines, roads and waters, with such other matters as may serve lor explanation ^ one copy whereof shall be deposited in the office of the secretary of the commonwealth, on or before the first day of January next, and one copy in the office of the clerk of Quarter Sessions of the. respective counties through which the said road may pass, omthe day aforesaid, or so much sooner as practicable; which shall bo a record thereof; and from thenceforth the said road shall be to all intents and purposes a public highway, and shall be opened and repaired in all respects as roads are opened and repaired, which are laid out by orders of the courts aforesaid.\u201d The second section contains the usual provisions as to the manner in which state -roads are to be laid out', one of which is \u201c that the vertical departure from a horizontal line, shall in no point exceed five degrees.\u201d The commissioners performed the duties enjoined upon them by the act, and filed a report agreeably to the provisions of the third section, in the office of the secretary of the commonwealth, and in the office of the clerks of the Quarter Sessions of Lehigh county, and Bucks cduntjq on the twenty-third day of July, 1835. The report which was fil\u00e9d in the office of the clerk of the sessions of Bucks county, was confirmed <em>nisi, </em>on the 15th of September, 1835; and on the same day the following exceptions to the report were filed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b393-8\">\u201cExceptions to the report of that.part of the state road above mentioned, which passes through Springfield township, Bucks county.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b393-9\">1. The commissioners were not legally sworn.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b393-10\">2.

The only act on the subject is that of act of 11th of April, 1325, which gives the court authority to vacate or change the route of a state road in granting a view or review of the same, which was not done here. <em>Gettysburg Road, </em>(2 <em>Penn. Rep. </em>289.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b394-7\">Mr. <em>Miles, </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b394-8\">The act of 11th of April, 1825, is inapplicable. That refers to cases of the <em>vacation </em>or <em>change </em>of a state road, laid out or to be laid out. This was a question of regularity of proceedings. The question depends on the act of the 10th of April, 1835, solely. By the third section, \u201c the road shall be opened and repaired, in all respects as roads are opened and repaired, which are laid out by orders of the courts aforesaid.\u201d These are under the general road law, under which the sessions have a supervisory jurisdiction over the proceedings. <em>Jonestown road, </em>(1 <em>Serg. &amp; Rawle, </em>487.) meets the whole case. The power of the court is implied and is necessary. 2 <em>Yeates, </em>33; 2 <em>Binn. </em>250. This court will assume the exceptions in fact to be correct. <em>Spring Garden street, (4 Rawle, </em>192;) 2 <em>Penn.

It never was intended to give that, or perhaps any other court, a power to vacate, without supplying the part vacated; and such might have been the consequence of giving the sessions power to quash. A state road leading through many counties, and constituting originally, a wffiole, might have been brollen into many fragments by it. The remedy for imperfections in the original location, is distinctly pointed out to be by view and review; and such ought to have been the course here.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-10\">Judgment of the Sessions quashed, \u00e1nd proceedings of the Commissioners affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
