Oct. 24. 1830, Report in favour of defendant filed. (Settled, and costs paid, $14 84.)\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b390-11\">The Court, in their charge to the jury, after stating the provisions of the act of 1772, \u201c for the prevention of frauds and perjuries,\u201d said:\u2014\u201c This law was enacted to prevent fraud, and is not itself to be made an instrument of fraud. The courts have held, that where a contract has been so far executed that it would be unjust to refuse to carry the contract into full effect, its terms should be enforced. In those cases the contract must be so far executed that the parties cannot be placed in the situation they were in, before the contract was entered into. The part performance of the contract must be pursuant to the contract, and in execution of the same. If the party in execution of the contract, enters upon the land and makes large improvements, the court would consider that as done which ought to be done, and bind the parties to the execution of the contract, to prevent fraud and injustice. Then on other principles, the party calling for the execution of the contract, must make out a case to the satisfaction of the jury. The contract must be established, and the performance which is relied upon must be proved. The same principles will apply to a gift from a parent to a child. What proof have you of a gift ? Are you satisfied from the evidence that the father did give this land for her life, to the wife of the defendant ? That he designed to give it to her by will, or in some other way, will not suffice; had he at any time given the land to her 1 If the evidence establishes this fact to-your satisfaction, then the defendant would so far have made out his case. We leave you to judge of this fact from the proof. You will recollect that but one witness speaks of his having given her the land; that is Shaffar. It is shown that this witness, when examined before the arbitrators, testified that the old man also spoke of giving the wife of the defendant this land by his will. Is there any thing in this case that makes it a fraud on the defendant and his wife, to withhold from them the land ? The fraud on the defendant and his wife, and their equity, must arise out of the alleged gift, and what they have done in consequence of it. That she did not get justice done her in the division of her father\u2019s estate has nothing to do with this case. The jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>are to find the facts in the case, and return their verdict, being governed by the charge of the court in matter of law. This you are bound by your oaths to do. What then is the particular equity or fact of the defendant in this case. All the expenditure of any extent, is on a stable, of about $20 or $30. The property it is proved would rent for $30 per year. They have occupied it for seven years. Would this improvement or expenditure render this gift valid, where the defendant is more than compensated by the occupancy for all improvements made, if the testimony, is believed? and there is no contradiction in this point. To take the case out of the statute we have read to you, a particular equity must be shown. If the defendant hqs been fully compensated, the specific execution of the gift would not be decreed. Then no injury would be done to the donee, no fraud practised upon the defendant which does any injustice, that would take the case out of Jthe statute. If you b.elieve that no improvements have been made beyond $20 or $30, and that the property was worth $30 a'year, and that the defendant occupied the same for seven years, then in point of law the case would not be taken out of the operation of the statute, and the plaintiff would be entitled to your verdict.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b391-6\">The jury found for the plaintiff;; and the defendant having removed the record, assigned the following errors:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b391-7\">\u201c 1. The court erred in charging the jury, that if the parties entered, and made large improvements, on the land, the court would consider that as done which ought to be done; thus leaving the jury to infer that large improvements alone made the gift valid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b391-8\">2. The court misdirected the jury, in stating that but one witness speaks of his (the father) having given her the land; that is Shaffar. It is shown that this witness, when examined before the arbitrators, testified that the old man also spoke of giving the wife of the defendant this land by his will.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b391-9\">3. The court erred in charging the jury, that if they believed that no improvements had been made beyond $20 or $30, and that the property was worth $30 a year, .'and that the defendant occupied the same for seven years, then in point of law, the case would not be taken out of the operation of the stattrte, and the plaintiff would be entitled to their verdict.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b391-10\">4. There is in writing, and given in evidence in the cause, a declaration of trust, under the hand and seal of Henry Romig, leaving to the'defendant\u2019s wife a life-estate in the land in question, of which no notice was taken by the court in their charge to the jury.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b391-11\">5.

There was scarce sufficient evidence of a contract to be left to the jury. But, permitting them to find a parol gift, if they should think proper, they were directed to inquire whether, as an inducement to expenditure, the gift had been, in fact, a prejudice to the donee. This put the cause on its true point. The improvements, as they are called, were at most equal in value only to a year\u2019s rent, and the donee had the premises five years. Beside the improvements were not such as added to the permanent value of the land, consisting, as they did, in repairs of fences, and the erection of a shed for a cow-stable\u2014expedients for present enjoyment, which can never be resorted to for an equity. These attempts to turn an experimental investiture of possession into a sale or gift executed, ai;e of such repeated occurrence, as to require the courts to hold a strict hand over them. There was nothing here to justify the inference of a gift in the first instance, or to take it out of the statute of frauds, if there had been one.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-8\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
