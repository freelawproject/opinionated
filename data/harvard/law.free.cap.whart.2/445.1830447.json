An action of partition as it is modified in this state cannot at present be maintained between these parties. There is no doubt that in case of the birth of other children of the daughters of the testator, the estate would if undivided open to admit them. <em>Fearne on Rem. </em>315, note <em>f. Cook v.

We are entitled by the common law and the provisions of the acts of assembly to partition of an estate held in fee simple, and it lies on the other side to show some restraint upon this right. We ask only that the moiety of Judith\u2019s share -shall be set off to us, and are willing to hold it subject to the possible birth of other issue. The difficulties that may arise in cas\u00e9 of a sale are not material here; though they are by no means insurmountable. It is common to order the investment of money brought into court after a sheriff\u2019s sale, where there is not a present right to receive it. Suppose this estate had been sold under a prior mortgage given by the testator and the surplus brought into court, the same question mightbe made. The partition is at all events good until the eventff'appens\u2014if it ever does\u2014which is to vary the rights of the partips. In <em>Wills </em>v. <em>Slade, </em>(6 <em>Ves. </em>498,) Lord Eldon puts this case and expressly affirms the right to partition. In <em>Parker </em>v. <em>Gerrard, (Ambler, </em>236,) it is said that a difficulty in making partition is no objection\u2014partition being a matter of right. And the law is laid down in the same way in <em>Baring </em>v. <em>Nash, </em>(1 <em>Ves. &amp; Beames, </em>555.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b448-9\">2. There are none of the words here whi'ch are frequently relied on by the courts, as an intention to divide <em>per capita. </em>The whole will is to be taken together, and it will be seen that he divides his property into three parts, and throughout proceeds upon the idea of representation. Now if the court have any doubt they will resort to the statute of distributions as the exponent; and then the descent is cast <em>per stirpes. </em>1 <em>Roper on Legacies, </em>126; 2 <em>Williams\u2019 Ex\u2019rs. </em>729; 7 <em>Ves. </em>531; 10 <em>Ves. </em>166; 2 <em>Cox\u2019s Eq. </em>187; 2 <em>Roberts on Wills, </em>p. 13, 29. In the case of <em>Lincoln </em>v. <em>Pelham, </em>cited on the other side, the Lord Chancellor relied on certain expressions of the testator, none of which are found here.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b448-10\">Mr../. <em>R. lngersoll, </em>in reply, was stopped by the court.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b448-11\">Rogers, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A3n\">(after stating the material facts)\u2014In <em>Way and another administrators of Way </em>v. <em>Gest, </em>(14 <em>Serg. &amp; Rawle, </em>40,) a case arising under the same will, it was decided, that the devise to Judith was of an estate'for life, with a contingent remainder, with a double aspect to her issue in fee. But in consequence of the death of Judith before her father, that which would otherwise have been a contingent remainder is converted into an executory devise to the issue of Judith in fee. The devise to her for life, never having taken effect, is considered as if limited without any intermediate estate of freehold, and enures by way of executory devise. Upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>the death of Judith, in the lifetime of the testator, the estates of the issue of the other child or children, became restored under the second aspect of the contingency provided in the will, viz. Judith dying without issue living to the age of twenty-one years, or having issue, then his other child or childrensYlawful issue, as tenants in common, to hold to them, their heirs and assigns, forever; and their interest in the estates, vest at the instant of their birth, liable however, as has been conceded in the argument, to open and let in the brothers and sisters as they might be afterwards born. Thus each share is liable,\u2019 under a subsequent contingency, to be diminished in quantity by the birth of after-born children-, and again to be enlarged by their death under the age of twenty-one years, without issue; and the estate of the persons <em>in esse </em>liable to be entirely defeated by his own death, under the age of twenty-one years, and without having issue. This being a case where, under this construction, persons may hereafter come <em>in esse </em>who may be eventually entitled to a share of this estate, the question arises whether this be an objection to the demand for a partition. In chancery, it would seem that it is no objection to a partition, that persons hereafter to come <em>in esse </em>may eventually be entitled, together with the present proprietors, under a contingent remainder, executory devise, or shifting use. This doctrine is grounded on the case of <em>Wells </em>v. <em>Slade, </em>(6 <em>Ves. </em>498,) where Lord Eldon is represented as having said, that this was no objection to a partition. But it must be observed that the case did not call for the decision of this question. The case was this: A. was tenant for life of an undivided moiety, with remainder to all the children of his body to be begotten, equally, as tenants in common in tail, with cross remainders among them in tail; A. and his four infants, brothers, filed a bill against the persons entitled to the other undivided moiety. An objection was taken from the possibility of other children, but in answer the counsel for the defendant said, that all parties were willing to have a partition, if it could be made; on which the Chancellor said : \u2018 At all events you are entitled to a partition during the life of the tenant for life.\u2019 He also further observed, \u2018 but I think this is no objection; for if so, in every case where there is a settled estate with remainders to persons who may come <em>in esse, </em>there never can be a partition.\u2019 In chancery, when a partition is made pursuant to a decree in equity, it is finally perfected by mutual conveyances of the allotments made to the several parties. And this is consonant to the well known doctrine, that a decree in equity does not bind the land itself like the judgment of a court of common law; but only binds the person. <em>JEquilas agit in person urn non in rem. </em>When once a partition therefore, as is said in <em>Ain alt on Partition, </em>123, is decreed in equity, and the commission is executed, the parties stand precisely in the same situation, so far as regards the conveyances or assurances necessary for the perfection of the partition, as if they had agreed among themselves to make <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>partition. There can be no doubt that the parties <em>in esse </em>may make an amicable or conventional partition, as they may voluntarily subject themselves to all the inconveniences which may result from a temporary division; and if Lord Eldon viewed the case of <em>Wells </em>v. <em>Slade, </em>as of that description, no possible objection can be made to the decree, for an account, and a commission for partition between the plaintiffs and defendants, according to the prayer of the bill. We are not informed in the report of the case, which is the only one cited, what was the nature of the final decree, nor whether the partition was temporary or permanent; nor in what way, if at ' all, the interests of the parties was protected. But conceding that this may be done, through the medium of the flexible machinery of a court of chancery, yet we do nop clearly perceive how such rights can be preserved through any process known to the courts of this state. It is very clear that the court cannot give a judgment in partition, of such a permanent nature as may not be liable to be defeated, or at least affected by the birth of other children, after judgment, for that would be contrary to the will of the testator, and a virtual disinherison of the children after born. The partition must of necessity be of temporary duration, depending upon a subsequent contingency, and in such case, the argument <em>ab inconvenienti </em>is exceedingly strong. On the birth of each child, the estate which before by the judgment in partition was held in severalty, is converted into an estate in common, at least so far as the interest of the after-born child is affected. A new partition must be made, and this may be again repeated at the birth of each successive child; and whether the after-born child would hold in common with each to whom the allotments had been made as a tenant in common, with all the devisees, might present a serious question. These are some of the difficulties which result if partition is made before all who may be eventually entitled, come <em>in esse. </em>Now although these are inconveniences to which a person may voluntarily submit by a conventional partition, yet under such circumstances, no person should be compelled in the language of the act to make partition, nor can we believe that this would be a reasonable construction of pthe statute. The holder in severalty, which must be of a temporary | duration, would be unable with safety either <em>to </em>improve or dispose of the share allotted to him, and property held by so precarious a tenure, would be of but little value to the possessor. Besides, where equal partition in value cannot be made, the sheriff and inquest by the act of the 7th of April, 1807, have power to equalize the purparts by a valuation of the purparts respectively, and making the shares subject to such sum as may equalize them in value. And by the act of the 11th of April, 1799, when the parties will not agree to take the lands at their appraised value, they are directed to be sold in the'manner therein prescribed. A difficulty arises as to the disposal of the money so as to secure the rights of all the parties now in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>interest; or who may hereafter be entitled. These considerations have induced the court to conclude that- the defendants cannot be compelled under the proper construction of the acts to make partition.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">The next question is, on the limitation over, whether the distribution is to be made <em>per stirpes </em>or <em>per capita. </em>The testator directs that if any of his daughters die without lawful issue, or- if having issue, and such issue all die in their mipprity, without leaving issue, then he gives the land and premises, so to them before allotted, to his other child or childrens\u2019 lawful issue, as tenants in common, to hold to them, their heirs, and assigns, forever.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-7\">Judith having died before her-father, this clause has been con-, strued as an immediate'devise to the lawful issue of his surviving children, viz. to the children of Mary and Ann, their heirs and assigns. <em>Way v. Gest, </em>(14 <em>Serg. &amp; Rawle, </em>40.) The word issue is often held to mean children, or descendants; and in that sense, it was used in this will. This term is of very extensive import, and when used as a word of purchase, and unconfined by any indication of intention, will comprise all persons who can claim as descendants, from or through the\u2019person to vihose issue the bequest is made. The testator passes by, in the limitation over, his own children, and limits the estate on the happening of certain contingencies to the issue; or in other words, to the child or children of his surviving daughter or daughters, as tenants in common, to hold to them, their heirs and assigns forever. It seems to me, that whatever the actual intention of the testator may have been, the legal construction of such words, and words of sinrilar import, has invariably been to make distribution <em>per capita; </em>nor can I perceive anything, but rather the contrary, in any preceding clause from which we can safely infer a contrary intention. \u2022 It has been repeatedly held, that when the bequest is to relations, to descendants, to next of kin, &amp;c. to be equally divided among them; or where expressions of a like import are used, the devisees will be entitled, as tenants in common, and will take equal shares <em>per capita, </em>1 <em>Roper on Legacies, </em>126, where the cases are collected. - Thus under a disposition by will, to A. and B.\u2019s families, children are entitled exclusively of their parents, and take <em>per capita. Barnes </em>v. <em>Patch, </em>(8 <em>Ves. jun. </em>604.) The Master of the Bills, in delivering the decree, says, that the only construction is, that by the words, family, children, are meant; and he adds, if that is the construction, does it not follow that the division must be <em>per capital </em>So under a devise to the issue of A. all descendants were held to be entitled. <em>Davenport </em>v. <em>Hanbury, </em>(3 <em>Ves. jun. </em>257.) In that case it-is intimated, that whenever they take as purchasers, the division must be made <em>per capita; </em>and in all cases when the words, \u201c equally to be divided,\u201d are superadded, it has been held that they take <em>per capita, </em>and that the only effect of these words is to change the estate, from a joint tenancy to a tenancy in common, 3 <em>Bro. C. </em>367. 3 <em>Ves. </em>257. And in <em>Blackler </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>v. <em>Webb &amp; al., </em>Samuel Bagwell, who was possessed of a considerable personal estate, and had several children, some of whom died leaving children, bequeathed the surplus of his estate equally to his son James, and to his son Peter\u2019s children, to his daughter Traverse, and to his daughter Webb\u2019s children, and it was held, that the children took <em>per capita. </em>The Chancellor was at first inclined to the opinion that the grandchildren should take <em>per stirpes, </em>but he at length decided, that each child should take <em>per capita, </em>as if all the grandchildren had been respectively named. In <em>Northey </em>v. <em>Strange, </em>(1 <em>P. Wms. </em>341,) it was held, that children and grandchildren take <em>per capita, </em>and not <em>per stirpes. </em>They all take in their own right, and not by way of representation. And in <em>Lady Lincoln v. Pelham, </em>(10 <em>Ves. </em>166,) it was also held, somewhat reluctantly, by the Chancellor, who was constrained to make the decree by the weight of authority, that in case of a bequest of one-fourth of an estate to the children of A., and one-fourth to and among the children of B., distribution must be made <em>per capita. </em>So where there was a bequest of personal estate to the testator\u2019s wife, \u201c and at her decease to be divided between her and my near relations equally,\u201d the estate, after the wife\u2019s death, was divided, .share and share alike, <em>per capita, </em>between the brothers and sisters of the testator, living at his death, and the children of such brothers and sisters as were dead, and the mother of the wife, the father being dead. <em>M\u2018Neilledge </em>v. <em>Galbraith et al. Ex. of Thomas, </em>(8 <em>Serg. &amp; Rawle, </em>43.) See also <em>M\u2018Neilledge el al. </em>v. <em>Barclay, </em>(11 <em>Serg. </em>&amp; <em>Rawle, </em>113,) where it is decided, that the real estate is to be divided in the same manner as the personal estate. Here the devise is, in effect, to the children of his daughters Mary and Ann, respectively, as tenants in common; who take the estate as purchasers, and not in right of their respective parents. In the absence, therefore, of any expression in the will which indicates a different intention, we think it necessarily results from the force of authority, that distribution must be made per <em>capita. </em>We are further of the opinion, that the estate of Jeremiah Gest was a fee simple, but that his estate was entirely defeated by his death, under the age of twenty-one years, and without having issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">Judgment of the Common Pleas reversed, and judgment for defendants.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
