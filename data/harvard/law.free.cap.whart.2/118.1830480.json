Hill, upon a claim filed on the 15th of November, 1834, for $19 95; being for stone furnished by the plaintiff, for the construction of a certain building owned by the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b118-13\">On the 16th of December, 1834, the plaintiff instituted a personal \u2022action against the defendant, before an alderman, who after hearing the parties, gave judgment for the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b118-14\">The <em>scire facias </em>on the claim, was issued on the 13th May, 1835. The defendant pleaded in bar, the former judgment in his favour, given by the alderman; to which the plaintiff demurred; and the Common Pleas gave judgment for the defendant on the demurrer.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b118-15\">The plaintiff having removed the record to this Court, assigned the following errors:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b118-16\">\u201c 1. The Court below erred, in deciding that the judgment of the alderman was conclusive between the parties in this cause.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b118-17\"><em>2. </em>The Court below erred, in entering judgment for the defendant, upon the demurrer to his plea.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b119-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>Mr. <em>G. M. Wharton, </em>for plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ate\">The judgment of the magistrate is not conclusive, because it was not between the same parties. The claim is against the building, <em>in </em>rem\u2014the action before the alderman, was against the defendant <em>in personam. Savoy </em>v. <em>Jones, (2 Rawle, </em>350.) There may have been no contract with the owner personally, and yet the building may be liable. In <em>Hampton </em>v. <em>Broom, </em>(1 <em>Miles, </em>241,) the District Court held that a judgment for the defendants in, a suit against A owner, and B. contractor, was not a bar to a suit by the same plaintiff, against C. owner,' and B. contractor. In <em>Thompson\u2019s case, </em>(2 <em>Browne, </em>297,) it was held by the same Court, that the entry of judgment upon a bond, by warrant of attorney, did not invalidate the lien. It is true that the case of <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Tierney, </em>(8 <em>Serg. &amp; Rawle, </em>59,) throws some doubt upon the point; but this Court has never decided it. <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>Morgan, </em>(11 <em>Serg. &amp; Rawle, </em>237.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b119-6\">The Court declined hearing Mr. <em>A. A. Broume, </em>for the defendant in error.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b119-7\">Per, Curiam.</author>\n<p id=\"AHY\">The action before the alderman, was between the same parties, and essentially for the same cause of action. It was brought to enforce the defendant\u2019s personal liability on-.the, original contract, which was adjudged to have been discharged, had it ever existed ,\u2022 and if the debt was discharged, the lien which secured it, being an accessary, was discharged also. A judgment for the defendant in an action on a bond secured by a mortgage, would discharge the mortgage, and why not discharge the lien here ? The point of indebtedness was directly decided by the alderman; and it can never be drawn in question again, between the same parties or their privies.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-8\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
