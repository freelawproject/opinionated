The trial judge heard the case on May 13, 1974, and on August 5, 1974, filed a document entitled \u201cFindings, Rulings and Order\u201d which concluded with the statement, \u201cThe petition for a Writ of Mandamus is hereby denied.\u201d The plaintiff appealed from the \u201cFindings, Rulings and Order.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>The appeal must be dismissed. The case having been tried before July 1, 1974, but no findings having been filed until after July 1, 1974, all proceedings after July 1 were required to conform to the new rules of civil and appellate procedure which became effective on that date.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> See Mass. R.Civ.P. 1A, subparagraph 8, 365 Mass. 732 (1974). After the filing of the judge\u2019s \u201cFindings, Rulings and Order\u201d the clerk did not, pursuant to Mass.R.Civ.P. 58 (a) (1), 365 Mass. 826 (1974), set forth on a separate document and enter a judgment denying the plaintiff\u2019s complaint for relief in the nature of mandamus. The judge\u2019s statement at the conclusion of his \u201cFindings, Rulings and Order\u201d that \u201c[t]he petition for a Writ of Mandamus is hereby denied\u201d did not constitute an effective entry of judgment. Since judgment has not been set forth on a separate document and entered, \u201cany appellate procedure is premature.\u201d See the eighth and ninth paragraphs of the Reporters\u2019 Notes to Mass.R.Civ.P. 58, Mass. Ann. Laws, Rules of Civil and Appellate Procedure at 368 (1974); <em>Nantucket Land Council, Inc. </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of Nantucket, ante, </em>206, 207 (1977), and material cited. Nevertheless, because the order for judgment is in such a form that the clerk may \u201center judgment without awaiting any direction by the court\u201d (MassR.Civ.P. 58[a] [1], as amended, 371 Mass. 908 [1977]), we proceed to consider by way of dictum the contentions argued by the parties. <em>Nantucket Land Council, Inc. </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of Nantucket, ante, </em>at 207-208.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>We summarize the findings of the judge. On December 3,1970, the plaintiff, pursuant to \u00a7 3-18 of the Marlborough building code, filed an application with the building inspector for a permit to build an apartment building on East Main Street in Marlborough. See G. L. c. 143, \u00a7 3, as in effect prior to St. 1972, c. 802, \u00a7 15.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> On January 18, 1972, after the plaintiff had obtained certain other permits necessary before obtaining a building permit, the building inspector refused to issue the building permit because \u201cthe land in question was improperly zoned.\u201d The plaintiff appealed from that decision to the Marlborough board of appeals (see G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 13, as in effect prior to St. 1975, c. 808, \u00a7 3), which reversed the decision and directed that the building inspector issue a permit under the zoning ordinance. After the plaintiff made certain changes in the building plans requested by the building inspector, the latter in early September, 1972, again refused to issue a building permit on the ground that a permit could not issue until the public safety committee of the city council (the committee) had approved the building plans. See \u00a7 3-18 of the Marlborough building code.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> On December 28, 1972, the committee disapproved the site plan. The plaintiff, pursuant to \u00a7 3-21 of the building code,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> petitioned the city council for a building permit. On April 23, 1973, the city council voted to uphold the committee\u2019s decision and deny a permit. The plaintiff made further changes in his building and site plans, obtained the approval of the building inspector, and at the request of the building inspector <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>resubmitted his application to the committee. On September 26, 1973, the committee refused to approve the modified plans, and on October 29,1973, the building inspector, not in the exercise of his independent judgment, but because of the action of the committee (see <em>C. &amp; H. Co. </em>v. <em>Building Commr. of Medford, </em>303 Mass. 499, 500 [1939]), refused to issue a building permit. The plaintiff again appealed to the city council which on December 3, 1973, voted to refer the matter back to the committee. After the committee again refused to approve the issuance of a building permit, the city council on February 4, 1974, denied the plaintiff\u2019s application.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">At trial, there was uncontradicted testimony, to which there was no objection, that after February 4, 1974, the committee voted, without notice to the plaintiff, in favor of the issuance of a building permit to the plaintiff, but that in April, 1974, the city council voted to overrule the decision of the committee without holding a public hearing or giving the plaintiff notice of its action.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">1. We first dispose of the plaintiff\u2019s contention that he is entitled to a building permit because the committee was without power to disapprove the issuance of a permit. This contention rests on the assertion that \u00a7 3-18 of the building code \u2014 which sets forth the procedure for applying for building permits and which authorizes the committee to act as the ultimate \u201crepresentative of the general public interest\u201d in determining whether a permit should issue (see <em>O\u2019Donnell </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Billerica, </em>349 Mass. 324, 326 [1965]) \u2014is invalid since it sets forth no standards for the guidance of the committee and thereby confers upon the committee unbridled discretion to grant or refuse a permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-7\">This contention of the plaintiff must fail. The plaintiff by seeking to have the Superior Court order the issuance of a permit under \u00a7 3-18 must be deemed to have recognized the validity of that section. <em>Karl V. Wolsey Co. Inc. </em>v. <em>Building Inspector of Bedford, </em>324 Mass. 419, 421-422 (1949). The plaintiff cannot simultaneously seek the issuance of a permit under \u00a7 3-18 and assert that that section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>is invalid. <em>Shemeth </em>v. <em>Selectmen of Holden, </em>317 Mass. 278, 280-281 (1944).</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">2. The plaintiff\u2019s remaining contention is that the city council was without authority to override the committee\u2019s vote, taken after February 4, 1974, approving the issuance of a permit to the plaintiff and therefore that the committee\u2019s vote entitles him to a permit. Before we reach the merits of this contention, we must consider a procedural problem. The plaintiff\u2019s complaint, having been filed without notice of (and apparently before) the committee\u2019s vote, sought relief only on the basis of the actions of the building inspector, the committee, and the city council through February 4, 1974. Relief granted on the basis of the actions of any of them after that date would, therefore, be beyond the scope of the pleadings. <em>Farinha </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Banks, </em>303 Mass. 192, 195 (1939). <em>Shemeth </em>v. <em>Selectmen of Holden, supra, </em>at 280.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">However, there appears to be no issue of fact concerning the actions of the committee and city council after February 4; those actions were fully testified to at the hearing before the trial judge, and the question whether the plaintiff is entitled to a permit as a result of the committee\u2019s vote has been fully argued before us. See <em>Farinha </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Banks, supra; Seder </em>v. <em>Kozlowski, </em>304 Mass. 367, 370 (1939); <em>Pridgen </em>v. <em>Boston Housing Authy. </em>364 Mass. 696, 717-718 (1974). See also <em>Payne </em>v. <em>R.H. White Co. </em>314 Mass. 63, 67 (1943). We believe in these circumstances that the plaintiff should be given an opportunity under Mass.R.Civ.P. 15 (b) or 15 (d), 365 Mass. 761, 762 (1974) (see Mass.R.Civ.P. 1A, subparagraph 2, citing rule 15); <em>M. DeMatteo Constr. Co. </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Hingham, </em>3 Mass. App. Ct. 446, 455-456, n.10 [1975]; see also 3 Moore\u2019s Federal Practice par. 15.16 [4] [1974]) to file either a motion to amend his pleadings to conform them to the evidence (see <em>Sandler </em>v. <em>Elliott, </em>335 Mass. 576, 589 [1957], and <em>Pridgen </em>v. <em>Boston Housing Authy. </em>364 Mass. at 717) or one for leave to serve a supplemental pleading setting forth the events occurring after the commencement of his action (see <em>Caputo </em>v. <em>Board </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number><em>of Appeals of Somerville, 330 </em>Mass. <em>107, </em>114 [1953], <em>Schertzer </em>v. <em>Somerville, </em>345 Mass. 747, 750 [1963], and <em>George Altman, Inc. </em>v. <em>Vogue Internationale, Inc. </em>366 Mass. 176, 180-181 [1974]). Either type of motion may be allowed even if, as a technical matter, the amendment or supplemental pleading results in the introduction into the suit of a new cause of action. See the last paragraph of the Reporters\u2019 Notes to Mass.R.Civ.P. 15, Mass. Ann. Laws, Rules of Civil and Appellate Procedure at 288 (1974). See also 3 Moore\u2019s Federal Practice par. 15.16 [3] (1974). Contrast <em>Knights </em>v. <em>Treasurer &amp; Recr. Gen. </em>236 Mass. 336, 338-341 (1920), and <em>Sharpe </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Transit Authy. </em>327 Mass. 171, 174 (1951), both decided before the adoption of the new rules of civil procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">On the assumption that the plaintiff does seek, and is permitted, to amend his pleadings or to serve a supplemental pleading so as to set forth the actions of the committee and the city council after February 4, 1974, which were testified to at the trial, we proceed to consider the plaintiff\u2019s contention that he is entitled to a permit as a result of the committee\u2019s vote. As we stated in part 1 of this opinion, \u00a7 3-18 of the Marlborough building code names the committee as the ultimate representative of the general public to determine whether a proposed construction satisfies the requirements of the building code. It is clear from the testimony at trial that the committee (and the building inspector) approved the issuance of a building permit to the plaintiff and that the sole reason a permit has not been issued is the city council\u2019s vote purportedly overruling the committee\u2019s vote approving the issuance of a permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">We are of the opinion that the city council\u2019s vote was invalid. The city council had no authority under the building code to act as an administrative body of original jurisdiction. <em>Rice </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Dennis, </em>342 Mass. 499, 501 (1961). No provision of the building code which has been brought to our attention authorizes an appeal to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>city council from a decision of the committee approving the issuance of a building permit;<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> nor is there an indication in the record that anyone attempted to appeal from the committee\u2019s approval of the issuance of a permit. In these circumstances the city council\u2019s vote purporting to override the decision of the committee constituted an \u201cimproper interference\u201d with the duties of the committee (and the building inspector). <em>Ouellette </em>v. <em>Building Inspector of Quincy, </em>362 Mass. 272, 275, 276, 278, n.9 (1972). See also <em>Fellsway Realty Corp. </em>v. <em>Building Commr. of Medford, </em>332 Mass. 471, 472-473 (1955), and <em>P &amp; D Serv. Co. Inc. </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals of Dedham, </em>359 Mass. 96, 104 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">The defendants\u2019 contention that the plaintiff is not entitled to relief in the nature of mandamus because he failed to exhaust other adequate remedies allegedly available to him must fail. When the committee\u2019s vote approving the issuance of a permit to the plaintiff failed to result in the issuance of a permit, no requirement arose that the plaintiff again petition the city council pursuant to \u00a7 3-21 for a permit before seeking relief in the nature of mandamus; the futility of thus petitioning the city council is apparent from the fact that the sole reason a building permit was not issued to the plaintiff was the city council\u2019s vote in effect directing that no permit be issued. See <em>Ciszewski </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Bd., </em>367 Mass. 135, 140-141 (1975). See also <em>Porter </em>v. <em>City Council of Malden, </em>346 Mass. 368, 372-373 (1963), and <em>Boston Edison Co. </em>v. <em>Selectmen of Concord, </em>355 Mass. 79, 84-85 (1968). Contrast <em>C. &amp; H. Co. </em>v. <em>Building Commr. of Medford, </em>303 Mass. at 500-501. In addition, the plaintiff was not deprived of the right to proceed by an action in the nature of mandamus by the fact that he might have sought declaratory relief pursuant to G. L. c. 231A. \u201cNothing of substance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>turns on whether the issue comes into court for adjudication by application for a writ or under G. L. c. 231A.\u201d <em>Woods </em>v. <em>Newton, </em>349 Mass. 373, 379 (1965). See <em>Kennedy </em>v. <em>Building Inspector of Randolph, </em>351 Mass. 550, 553 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">We conclude that, if the plaintiff is permitted to (and does) amend his pleadings or serve a supplemental pleading so as to set forth the actions of the committee and the city council subsequent to February 4, 1974, which were testified to at the trial, the plaintiff will be entitled to a judgment ordering that a building permit be issued to him.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>Kenney </em>v. <em>Building Commr. of Melrose, </em>315 Mass. 291, 293-294, 296 (1943). <em>Fellsway Realty Corp. </em>v. <em>Building Commr. of Medford, </em>332 Mass. at 472-473. <em>Cullen </em>v. <em>Building Inspector of No. Attleborough, </em>353 Mass. 671, 678 (1968). <em>Ouellette </em>v. <em>Building Inspector of Quincy, </em>362 Mass. at 280. See <em>Hallenborg </em>v. <em>Town Clerk of Billerica, </em>360 Mass. 513, 519-520 (1971). Not only has the committee (and the building inspector) determined that the plaintiff\u2019s plans satisfy the requirements of the building code, but also the board of appeals has determined that the plaintiff\u2019s plans for the construction of an apartment building violate no provision of the city\u2019s zoning ordinance. See <em>Boston </em>v. <em>Pagliaro, 1 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 117, 122 (1973). If within such time from the issuance of the rescript of this court as the Superior Court deems reasonable the plaintiff does not move that he be permitted to amend his pleadings or to serve a supplemental pleading, or if the plaintiff after the allowance of such a motion fails to amend his pleadings or to serve a supplemental pleading within such time as that court may allow, judgment is to be entered in accordance with the original order for judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>The appeal is dismissed.
