On May 8, 1973, he was apprehended and was subsequently tried and convicted for the crime of escape from a prison camp. G. L. c. 127, \u00a7 83C. Pursuant to \u00a7 83B<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> of that chapter, the plaintiff forfeited 213 days of good conduct deductions which he had accumulated prior to the escape. On September 18, 1974, the plaintiff requested that the defendant Commissioner restore those good conduct deductions. The Commissioner denied the request on the ground that under \u00a7 83B he had no power \u201cto consider restoration of the 213 days good conduct deductions that you forfeited by escaping \u2014\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">The plaintiff then commenced this action for a judicial determination that the Commissioner was authorized to restore the good conduct deductions. The judge who heard the action in the Superior Court on an agreed statement of facts ruled that the Commissioner lacked that authority, and the plaintiff appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">Section 83B explicitly required the forfeiture of the plaintiff\u2019s accumulated good time deductions. It makes no provision for restoration thereof. But the plaintiff argues that such a provision is seen to be implicit in \u00a7 83B when it is compared with \u00a7 129 of the same chapter.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-7\">Unlike \u00a7 83B, which applies only to prison camps, \u00a7 129 deals with correctional institutions generally, including prison camps. Section 129<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> authorizes good conduct deductions from sentences, but contains two provisions by which such deductions may be lost. The first relates to infractions of prison rules: \u201cIf a prisoner violates any rule of his place <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>of confinement, the commissioner..., upon the recommendation and evidence submitted [by the officer in charge of the institution where the prisoner is confined] ... shall decide what part, if any, of such good conduct deduction ... shall be forfeited by such violation, and may likewise determine, in the event of the prisoner\u2019s subsequent good conduct, whether any or all of such deduction shall be restored.\u201d The second relates to convictions for criminal offenses: \u201cIf, during the term of imprisonment of a prisoner confined in a correctional institution of the commonwealth, such prisoner shall commit any offense of which he shall be convicted and sentenced, he shall not be entitled to any deductions hereunder from the new sentence or sentences of imprisonment.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">The plaintiff first argues that the word \u201cforfeit,\u201d used both in \u00a7 83B and in the rules infractions portion of \u00a7 129, is capable of being understood either in the sense of a permanent loss or in the sense of loss with a possibility of restoration; and that, since it has been held that the two sections are to be treated as using identical language in a uniform sense <em>(Wood </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>363 Mass. 79, 82, fn.5 [1973]), and since \u00a7 129 uses the word \u201cforfeit\u201d in the sense of loss with a possibility of restoration, the same meaning must be given to the word \u201cforfeit\u201d in \u00a7 83B. The argument is patently unsound, because the possibility of restoration is not derived from the word \u201cforfeit,\u201d but from \u00a7 129\u2019s explicit provision to that effect; and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>the absence of similar language in \u00a7 83B makes it clear that the Legislature\u2019s intention was precisely contrary to the plaintiff\u2019s first argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">The plaintiff next argues that, although his escape was a crime, it was also a breach of prison rules,* <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> thus bringing the offense within the rules infraction portion of \u00a7 129, which permits restoration of forfeited good conduct deductions. This reasoning would effect the anomaly that one whose conduct violates both statute and rule would be accorded greater leniency than one who violates only a statute. It would also attribute to the Commissioner of Correction a power to modify statutes by administrative regulation. The argument is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">The plaintiff\u2019s final argument is that the description in \u00a7 83B of the offense of escape differs from the description in \u00a7 83C<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> of the crime of escape, and from this he concludes that \u00a7 83B must be referring to the \u201cinstitutional infraction of escape\u201d rather than the crime of escape. But we think that the correct interpretation of the pertinent words in \u00a7 83B (\u201ca prisoner [who] escapes or attempts to escape from a prison camp\u201d) is that they refer to one who commits either of the two crimes (escape and attempt to escape) which are described in \u00a7 83C.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The operation of \u00a7 83B does not depend on the existence of an administrative regulation prohibiting escape. None has been mentioned in the cases <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>which have arisen under \u00a7 83B.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Moreover, a contrary conclusion would avail the plaintiff naught, because the more particular provision made for an institutional infraction of escape from a prison camp in \u00a7 83B would clearly prevail over the general provisions of \u00a7 129 relative to rules infractions of any type in any prison. There is nothing inconsistent or unharmonious about a statute which provides a severe penalty for particular conduct which would warrant only a lesser penalty under a general statute in its absence. Nor do we perceive any ambiguity in \u00a7 83B which would justify invoking the principle that penal statutes are to be strictly construed.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">This case was argued before a panel comprised of Justices Keville, Goodman and Armstrong.

A contention was made in <em>Gregoire, petitioner, </em>355 Mass. 399 (1969), that the 1963 amendment had impliedly repealed \u00a7 83B, since (it was argued) the Legislature could not have intended that one who escapes from a prison camp (as opposed to one who escapes from other correctional institutions) should suffer the double penalty of loss of good conduct deductions from the initial sentence (\u00a7 83B) and loss of entitlement to good conduct deductions from the sentence imposed for the escape (\u00a7 129). The Supreme Judicial Court rejected the contention.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b450-7\"> So far as appears in this record, there is no rule expressly forbidding escape.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b450-9\"> Section 83C, inserted by St. <em>1951, \u00a7 755, </em>provides: \u201cA prisoner who escapes or attempts to escape from any prison camp <em>or from land adjacent thereto or from the custody of the officer thereof or while being conveyed to and from any such camp </em>... shall be punished by imprisonment ....\u201d The emphasis is added to indicate the language which does not appear in \u00a7 83B, upon which the plaintiff relies.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b450-10\"> The somewhat offhand suggestion to the contrary made by the Attorney General in <em>Gregoire, petitioner, </em>355 Mass. 399 (1969), referred to in the dissenting opinion of Goodman, J., was not accepted by the court as a ground of decision. The principal point the Attorney General appears to have been making is that forfeiture under \u00a7 83B may be imposed on an administrative determination, whether or not the crime is prosecuted to a conviction.

The substance of the plaintiff\u2019s contention is that G. L. c. 127, \u00a7 83B,* <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> 2must be read together with the fourth sentence of the first paragraph of G. L. c. 127, \u00a7 129, which authorizes the Commissioner to restore forfeited good conduct deductions \u201cin the event of the prisoner\u2019s subsequent good conduct.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> From our examination of these provisions, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>the legislative course of each of the statutes in which they are respectively contained, we conclude that the plaintiff is correct and that the judgment should be reversed.* *<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">The prison camp escape provision, as it now reads (note 1, supra), was enacted in 1951 as part of a comprehensive program for the establishment of prison camps in State forests. St. 1951, c. 755, inserting \u00a7\u00a7 83A-83D, inclusive, in chapter 127 of the General Laws.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> At that time \u00a7 129 (as rewritten by St. 1948, c. 450 \u2014 \u201cAn Act relative to deductions from maximum sentences of prisoners\u201d) contained substantially the same provision for the administrative forfeiture of good conduct allowances as is presently in effect in that section, except that it made no provision for their restoration for subsequent good conduct (see note 2, supra). Section 129 also then provided that: \u201cIf during the term of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>imprisonment... such prisoner shall commit any offense of which he shall be convicted and sentenced, all deductions hereunder from the former sentence of imprisonment... shall be thereby forfeited\u201d (herein referred to as the 1948 conviction forfeiture provision).</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">In 1955 the Legislature enacted a thoroughgoing reorganization of the penal system by St. 1955, c. 770, entitled \u201cAn Act relative to the penal and reformatory institutions of the commonwealth.\u201d See 1955 Ann. Surv. of Mass. Law, \u00a7\u00a7 12.1-12.13. It was based on a study of the entire correction system by a commission of penologists, headed by President Wessell of Tufts College. 1955 Sen. Doc. No. 750, \u201cReport and Recommendations of the Governor\u2019s Committee to Study the Massachusetts Correctional System.\u201d The Wessell committee had been appointed soon after a four-day rebellion in Charlestown prison and was concerned with the problems of prison discipline. The study points out that good conduct allowances \u201care useful for institutional discipline, using the term discipline in the proper sense, that is, as an incentive to good morale, rather than in a negative sense, discipline maintained by punishment\u201d (at 71), and further that \u201c [t]he granting or denial of good-time allowances is a matter of institutional management and discipline. It should be controlled within the Department of Correction...\u201d (at 73). In accordance with this principle the Wessell committee recommended that the provision for automatic loss of good time upon conviction for an offense while in prison (the 1948 conviction forfeiture provision) be eliminated entirely; and this recommendation was embodied in the revised draft of \u00a7 129 of c. 127 submitted by the Wessell committee (see 1955 Sen. Doc. No. 750, at 142-143), in the draft of the Special Committee on the Reorganization of the Correctional System of the House of Representatives to which the Wessell report was referred (see 1955 House Doc. No. 3098, at 40-41), and in the ultimate legislation (St. 1955, c. 770, \u00a7 66), which rewrote \u00a7 129. The draft of the House committee bill and the ultimate legislation (though not the original draft of the Wessell committee bill) also added, to the provision in \u00a7 129 for the admin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>istrative forfeiture of good conduct deductions, a further provision for their restoration for \u201csubsequent good conduct\u201d (see note 2, supra). 1955 House Doc. No. 3098, at 41.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">However, in spite of the elimination of the 1948 conviction forfeiture provision, both drafts and the ultimate legislation let stand the prison camp escape provision in \u00a7 83B (see note 1, <em>supra). </em>We do not view this as an inadvertance,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and it need not be regarded as an inconsistency. The prison camp escape provision \u2014 unlike the 1948 conviction forfeiture provision for ministerial forfeiture because of prison offenses \u2014 did not require a conviction and sentence. (Contrast G. L. c. 127, \u00a7 83C, note 4, <em>supra.) </em>We note the characterization of the \u00a7 83B prison camp escape provision in the Attorney General\u2019s brief (at 2) in <em>Gregoire, petitioner, </em>355 Mass. 399 (1969), which dealt with the relationship between the prison camp escape provision and a 1963 provision (St. 1963, c. 535) with reference to convictions for offenses while in prison: \u2014 \u201cSection 83B punishes escapes or attempted escapes as an infraction of rules whether or not a conviction is obtained, while section 129 punishes <em>any </em>act for which a conviction is secured...\u201d (emphasis in original). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sneed, </em>3 Mass. App. Ct. 33, 34 (1975), which deals with the situation in which \u201cconviction of escape... follow [s] the imposition of a forfeiture of good time arising from the same occurrence,\u201d which forfeiture is administrative in nature. See cases cited. Compare <em>Munkley </em>v. <em>Hoyt, </em>179 Mass. 108, 111 (1901).</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">Nor are administrative proceedings to determine whether an escape has occurred necessarily perfunctory; they may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>require factual determinations of some complexity. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gosselin, </em>1 Mass. App. Ct. 849 (1973), <em>S.C. </em>365 Mass. 116 (1974). And at least since <em>Wolff </em>v. <em>McDonnell, </em>418 U. S. 539, 557 (1974), such proceedings may also require the application of procedural safeguards comparable to those applicable to the administrative forfeiture provisions of \u00a7 129. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Druken, </em>356 Mass. 503, 506-509 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">The application of the provision for administrative restoration of good time in \u00a7 129 to the good time administratively forfeited upon proceedings under \u00a7 83B seems to us to place the prison camp escape provision in the context of the Wessell committee\u2019s recommendation for greater administrative flexibility in the administration of good time; and thus the failure by the Wessell committee to make any change in the \u00a7 83B provision becomes understandable. Indeed, when the 1948 conviction forfeiture provision was reinstated by St. 1959, c. 445 (see 1963 Ann. Surv. Mass. Law \u00a7 11.3), no change was made in the prison camp escape provision (note 1, supra). Nor was any change made in that provision in 1963 when St. 1963, c. 535, eliminated the conviction forfeiture provision and substituted for it a provision that the only entitlement lost would be from the new sentence \u2014 though the 1963 statute was based on the recommendations of the Department of Correction (1963 House Doc. Nos. 20,21), made together with recommendations for changes in good time allowances for inmates of prison camps. See 1963 House Doc. No. 22, which became G. L. c. 127, \u00a7 129C, by St. 1963, c. 164 (\u201cAn Act providing a further deduction of sentence for good conduct while confined \u00e1t a prison camp\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">That the forfeited deductions which are subject to restoration are directed by \u00a7 83B, rather than by \u00a7 129, is not particularly significant. Indeed, additional good time allowances for prison camp inmates are provided in the separate provision of G. L. c. 127, \u00a7 129C; and it would surely be anomalous to hold that, because that provision was separate from the provisions of \u00a7 129, the administrative forfeiture and restoration provisions of \u00a7 129 have no application <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>to these additional good time allowances. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hayes, </em>372 Mass. 505, 508-512 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">Accordingly, we view the \u201csuch deductions\u201d which may be restored in \u00a7 129 as referring not only to those administratively forfeited in \u00a7 129, but also to those administratively forfeited in \u00a7 83B.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">This comports with the teaching of <em>Gregoire, petitioner, </em>355 Mass. at 400, that the statutes be read together as a harmonious system. See <em>Lembersky </em>v. <em>Parole Bd. of the Dept. of Correction, </em>332 Mass. 290, 292-293 (1955) ; <em>Wood </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>363 Mass. 79, 82, fn.5 (1973). It also comports with the more general rule that penal statutes be strictly construed in favor of a defendant. <em>Wood </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>363 Mass. at 81, and cases cited.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b451-9\"> General Laws c. 127, \u00a7 83B, as amended through St. 1972, c. 172, \u00a7 2, presently provides in pertinent part: \u201cIf a prisoner escapes or attempts to escape from a prison camp all deductions from the sentence he is then serving shall be thereby forfeited\u201d (hereinafter referred to as the prison camp escape provision).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b451-10\"> General Laws c. 127, \u00a7 129, as amended through St. 1967, c. 379, presently provides in pertinent part: \u201cIf a prisoner violates any rule of his place of confinement, the commissioner of correction..., upon the recommendation and evidence submitted to...

The House committee bill specifically deleted from \u00a7 83B a provision for work time allowance which the Wessell committee had recommended be eliminated as unsound (1955 Sen. Doc.

L. c. 127, \u00a7 129, St. 1955, c. 770, \u00a7 66, was intended by the Legislature to give prison officials more flexibility in disciplining prisoners. Construing G.

This more humane approach (see <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>336 Mass. 718, 721 [1958]) would have the salubrious effect of providing greater incentive for good behavior on the prisoner\u2019s part while still providing \u00e1 sufficient deterrent for escape.
