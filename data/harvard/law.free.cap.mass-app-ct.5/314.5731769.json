The defendant appeals from the conviction of armed robbery pursuant to G. L. c. 278, \u00a7\u00a7 33A-33G.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The defendant moved before trial to suppress out-of-court and anticipated in-court identifications of him by a witness, one Richard Osgood. After a lengthy voir dire the judge made rulings based on detailed findings of fact. He denied the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress two photographic identifications and the anticipated in-court identification of the defendant. He allowed the motion to suppress identifications made by Osgood at probable cause hearings in both the Peabody and Salem District Courts on the basis of <em>\u201cKirby </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>406 U. S. 682 (1972) .\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The defendant assigns as error the judge\u2019s refusal to suppress the in-court identification, and his failure to charge the jury as he had requested.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-9\">Following is a summary of the judge\u2019s findings, amplified by some details from the transcript, as they relate to the confrontations and identifications of the defendant by Osgood. On February 24, 1972, at about 8:00 or 8:30 p.m., one Lee, a tenant in a duplex owned by Osgood, was robbed. At that time, Osgood, the occupant of the other half of the duplex, returned home in his automobile. It was \u201ca bright clear night.\u201d Bradstreet Avenue, in the area of the duplex, was artificially illuminated by two streetlights <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>of the mercury-vapor type. A recent snowfall further brightened the area.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">Osgood parked his car on the opposite side of the street from the duplex and proceeded to shovel out a parking space directly in front of his house. This was about \u201ctwenty to thirty feet from Lee\u2019s front entrance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">Osgood was shovelling for about ten minutes during which time the judge found he made the following observations. A man who Osgood at first thought was Lee was behind the wheel of Lee\u2019s car. There was a second man, dressed in a plaid jacket, later identified by Osgood as the defendant, who was standing near a Ford station wagon which was in front of Lee\u2019s car. These men were attempting to start the Ford with jumper cables attached to Lee\u2019s car, an Oldsmobile. A third man opened the door of the Lee premises twice. He yelled to the two men outside, inquiring if the car was running yet. Osgood became suspicious and approached Lee\u2019s car. At that time, Lee\u2019s Oldsmobile was being used to push the Ford down the street. As Osgood walked up to Lee\u2019s car the driver put on dark sunglasses and slumped down in the seat. The third man then came out of Lee\u2019s residence, dropped a beer bottle into the snow, and got into the Oldsmobile, which was immediately driven away. Osgood then entered Lee\u2019s apartment and found him untying his bonds. Later that night Osgood gave a description of two of the men to the police.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (He was unable to describe the driver of the Lee car.)</p>\n<p id=\"b338-7\">About a week later at the fire station where Osgood was employed a \u201cpolice officer showed up with a large photo album.\u201d Out of numerous photographs Osgood identified the defendant as the man in the plaid jacket. He also identified Anderson as the man he thought he saw in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>doorway.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> There was evidence that the policeman who came to the fire station told Osgood, after the latter had identified the defendant, that the name of the man in the plaid jacket was MacMillan.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">The judge further found that approximately one month later both Anderson and the defendant were arrested while riding in Lee\u2019s Oldsmobile. Osgood and Lee were asked to come down to the Peabody police station, where each was shown approximately twelve photographs. \u201cThese photographs were shown to the witnesses one at a time and were not displayed in any unusual manner.\u201d The photographs of the defendant and Anderson, however, had been taken that afternoon by the Peabody police. Osgood picked out the Peabody police photographs of the defendant and Anderson. Osgood remembered being able to identify both the defendant and Anderson positively at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">The judge also found that the next day Osgood and Lee viewed the defendant and Anderson in the Peabody District Court at a probable cause hearing.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> (The defendant and Anderson were handcuffed at that time.) He also found that a week later Osgood and Lee viewed the defendant and Anderson in the Salem District Court at another probable cause hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-7\">At the voir dire Osgood identified the defendant as one of the persons he had observed on the night of the robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-8\">1. The defendant\u2019s principal argument on appeal is that Osgood\u2019s in-court identification of the defendant was tainted by prior suggestive confrontations. We agree with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>the defendant\u2019s contention that Osgood\u2019s view of the two handcuffed suspects at a probable cause hearing was suggestive. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Frank, </em>357 Mass. 250, 252 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">Our conclusion that the confrontations at the Peabody and Salem District Courts were suggestive does not, however, end our inquiry. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cooper, </em>356 Mass. 74, 84 (1969). We must determine whether the in-court identification was properly allowed as being based upon observations of the suspect other than those made at the Peabody and Salem District Courts. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mendes, </em>361 Mass. 507, 510-511 (1972). The Commonwealth must establish \u201cby clear and convincing evidence\u201d (see <em>United States </em>v. <em>Wade, </em>388 U. S. 218, 240 [1967]) that the in-court identifications were not tainted by the suppressed out-of-court identifications. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Botelho, </em>369 Mass. 860, 868 (1976), and cases cited. The judge conducted an extensive voir dire and concluded that the anticipated \u201cin-Court identification was not tainted by any prior suggestive proceedings but was based upon the observations made by the witnesses at the time that they made these observations on February 24, 1972.\u201d Where the trial judge makes detailed findings, fully supported by the evidence, such findings \u201care not likely to be disturbed by us.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Frank, </em>357 Mass. at 254.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\"><em>Wade </em>lists six factors to be employed in determining whether the in-court identification was independent of and not tainted by the suggestive pretrial confrontations.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Although the weight of each of these factors may vary with the particular factual context presented <em>(Commonwealth </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>v. <em>Ross, </em>361 Mass. 665, 671-672 [1972], vacated on other grounds 410 U. S. 901, affd. on rehearing 363 Mass. 665, cert. den. 414 U. S. 1080 [1973] ), the witness\u2019 opportunity to observe the defendant at the time of the incident is generally considered to be the most important factor. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Flaherty, </em>1 Mass. App. Ct. 282, 287 (1973). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kennedy, </em>3 Mass. App. Ct. 218, 221, n.4 (1975). \u201cClearly the firmer the contemporaneous impression, the less is the witness subject to be influenced by subsequent events.\u201d <em>Allen </em>v. <em>Moore, </em>453 F. 2d 970, 975 (1st Cir. 1972). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mendes, </em>361 Mass. at 511. In the instant case Osgood was able to observe the defendant over a period of about ten minutes, under good lighting conditions, and only a short distance away from him. Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Underwood, </em>3 Mass. App. Ct. 522, 534 (1975), and cases cited. It is also significant that Osgood observed the defendant \u201cunder circumstances [that would be] likely to fix in the mind of the witness the identity of the person confronted.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Frank, </em>357 Mass. at 254. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Flaherty, </em>1 Mass. App. Ct. at 288, and cases cited. In addition, the fact that Osgood was able to identify the defendant by photograph on two occasions prior to the suggestive confrontation lends strong support for the judge\u2019s conclusion that the in-court identification was made independently of the suggestive pretrial confrontations. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cooper, </em>356 Mass. at 84-85; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Underwood, </em>3 Mass. App. Ct. at 535.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">Our consideration of the evidence heard by the judge at voir dire satisfies us that the in-court identification was independent of the prior suggestive confrontations. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ross, </em>361 Mass. at 672; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Flaherty, </em>1 Mass. App. Ct. at 287. Accordingly, we conclude that the Commonwealth met its burden of proving that Osgood\u2019s in-court identification was based on his observations of the defendant at the scene of the crimes, and not on the suppressed identifications. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Henley, </em>1 Mass. App. Ct. 564, 567 (1973). See <em>Common</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number><em>wealth </em>v. <em>Ferguson, </em>365 Mass. 1, 7 (1974), and cases cited; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hogg, </em>4 Mass. App. Ct. 225, 228 (1976), and cases cited. There was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-4\">2. The defendant also challenges the judge\u2019s charge to the jury on \u201creasonable doubt,\u201d especially that portion defining \u201creasonable doubt\u201d as \u201ca doubt for which a good reason can be given.\u201d In isolation that instruction was of doubtful propriety, but we believe the charge as a whole <em>(Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pettie, </em>363 Mass. 836, 843 [1973]; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Therrien, </em>371 Mass. 203, 207 [1976]) gave the jury a correct understanding of the Commonwealth\u2019s burden of proof. In context, the charge given here was substantially identical to those given and held satisfactory in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bjorkman, </em>364 Mass. 297, 307, 309 (1973), and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Coleman, </em>366 Mass. 705, 712 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">3. The defendant\u2019s only other assignment of error based on an exception (see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Myers, </em>356 Mass. 343, 346 [1969], and cases cited) was not argued and is therefore deemed to have been waived. See Rule 1:13 of the Appeals Court, as amended effective February 27,1975, 3 Mass. App. Ct. 801; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Blaney, ante, </em>96, 100, n.5 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b337-10\"> The larceny conviction was filed with the defendant\u2019s consent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b337-11\"> Although the judge did not so state in his memorandum opinion, it is fair to assume that the defendant was not represented by counsel in either of the District Court proceedings.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b338-8\"> Osgood was unable to remember the details of the description of the man he later identified as the defendant except that he was wearing a plaid jacket.
