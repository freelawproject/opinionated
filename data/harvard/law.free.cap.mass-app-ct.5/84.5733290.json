L. c. 71, \u00a7 \u00a7 38G and 38H) claiming to be entitled to the benefits of the tenure provisions of G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 41, seeks reinstatement as a librarian in the Sharon public school system, and damages. The case was referred to a master <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>under an order of reference which did not require him to report any evidence except as Rule 49, \u00a7 7, of the Superior Court (1974) might apply.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The master filed a report in which, based on his subsidiary findings, he made an ultimate \u201cfinding\u201d that the. plaintiff \u201cis not entitled to tenure.\u201d On the objections and motion of the plaintiff, the judge ordered the report recommitted to the master for further subsidiary findings on certain critical points. The master complied. The judge adopted the original and further subsidiary findings of the master, rejected the aforementioned ultimate finding of the master (see <em>Wormstead </em>v. <em>Town Manager of Saugus, </em>366 Mass. 659, 660 [1975]), and entered a judgment which: (1) declared that the plaintiff had been serving on tenure as a librarian at the critical point in time; (2) declared that the school committee (committee) had not complied with the provisions of G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 42; and (3) ordered that the plaintiff be reinstated with back pay, all fringe benefits and interest. The committee has appealed from the judgment and from the denial of a motion subsequently filed by it under Mass.R.Civ.P. 60 (b), 365 Mass. 828 (1974) .<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">1. We quote from or summarize the original and further subsidiary findings<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> made by the master and adopted by the judge which we consider relevant to the question whether the plaintiff is entitled to the benefits of tenure as a school librarian under the provisions of G. L. c. 71, \u00a7\u00a7 38H (inserted by St. 1965, c. 276)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and 41 (as appear<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>ing in St. 1972, c. 464, \u00a7 1).6 See <em>Frye </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Leicester, </em>300 Mass. 537, 539 (1938).</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">The plaintiff was \u201cappointed by the... [committee] for the 1969-1970 school year\u201d and \u201cwas employed as a library assistant at the Sharon Senior High School for\u201d that year. \u201cHer salary was to be at the rate of $25.00 per day for each day worked.\u201d She worked 181 of the 182 days in that school year. \u201cDuring the school year 1969-1970, she worked at the high school library with Miss Marion Clark, the librarian.\u201d The plaintiff was \u201chired by the ... [committee] as a librarian at the senior high school for the school year 1970-1971. Her salary was $8,400.00 per year____Her duties were the same as during the prior year. For the school year 1971-1972, the... [plaintiff] worked as a librarian at the high school at an annual salary of $9,555.00.... Her duties were unchanged from the previous two years---[F]or the school year 1972-1973, the... [plaintiff] worked as a librarian at the high school. Her salary was $10,430.00 per year. During this period her duties were the same as in previous years.\u201d Some time early in April, 1973, the plaintiff\u2019s \u201cposition\u201d was \u201cterminated,\u201d or \u201celiminated,\u201d by vote of the committee \u201cfor budgetary purposes.\u201d Prior to April 15 the plaintiff was notified in writing by the superintendent of schools that \u201cbecause of the ... [committee\u2019s] vote, she would not be rehired for the school year of 1973-1974.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b108-10\">We say first that we think the committee attaches too much significance to the titles \u201clibrary assistant\u201d and \u201cli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>brarian\u201d which were assigned to the plaintiff\u2019s position in the school year 1969-1970 and the school years 1970 through 1973, respectively, in view of the master\u2019s finding that during the first year \u201cthe [p]laintiff\u2019s duties did not differ from those of Miss Clark,\u201d who was described by the master as \u201cthe librarian.\u201d It is \u201c[t]he character of the labor performed [which] <em>is... </em>important in determining the precise position held when [as here] that is not definitely established by official records.\u201d <em>LaMarsh </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Chicopee, </em>272 Mass. 15,18 (1930).</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">Nor do we see any significance in the master\u2019s indiscriminate use of variations of the words \u201cappoint,\u201d \u201cemploy\u201d and \u201chire\u201d in describing the source of the relationship between the parties in the various school years. None of those words appears to have been used advisedly, and variations of two of those words (as well as the word \u201celect\u201d) appear to have been used more or less interchangeably in G. L. c. 71, \u00a7\u00a7 38H and 41 (nn. 5 and 6, <em>supra), </em>without affecting the sense of either section.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">The committee points to the finding that the plaintiff was \u201cappointed by the ... [committee] for the 1969-1970 school year,\u201d points to the use of that word in \u00a7 38H (n. 5, <em>supra), </em>and urges the absence of any finding that the plaintiff was \u201cappointed\u201d by the committee in any of the subsequent school years. See and compare <em>Nester </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Fall River, </em>318 Mass. 538, 543 (1945). See also <em>Demers </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Worcester, </em>329 Mass. 370, 372-373 (1952). The argument overlooks the finding that the plaintiff was \u201chired by the [committee] ... for the school year 1970-1971.\u201d It also overlooks the finding that the superintendent of schools advised the plaintiff that she \u201cwould not be rehired for the school year of 1973-1974\u201d because of the committee\u2019s vote to terminate or eliminate the plaintiff\u2019s \u201cposition.\u201d We are not prepared to assume that the committee was unaware of the $19,985 spent on the plaintiff\u2019s salary during the school years 1971 through 1973; indeed, the expense of her salary was the reason for eliminating the plaintiff\u2019s position. We think it would be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>wrong to infer that the plaintiff\u2019s engagement in those years had been effected only by the superintendent or some lesser functionary.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">On the reasoning that things equal to the same thing are equal to each other, the master must be taken to have found that the plaintiff\u2019s duties were the same in all four school years. Her work was performed in the same place in all four years. The only remaining question of any substance is whether the school year 1969-1970 can be counted for the purpose of determining tenure. Looking to the \u201csubstance of the relationship between the [parties]\u201d <em>(Ryan </em>v. <em>Superintendent of Schs. of Quincy, </em>363 Mass. 731, 740 [1973]) and considering the fact that the plaintiff worked 181 of the 182 school days of the year 1969-1970, we conclude (A) that the plaintiff\u2019s service during that year was \u201cregular and continuous\u201d <em>(Nester </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Fall River, </em>318 Mass. at 542-543) rather than \u201cintermittent and irregular\u201d <em>(Nester </em>case, at 542; <em>Brodie </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Easton, </em>3 Mass. App. Ct. 141, 143 [1975]) and (B) that the plaintiff had the benefits of tenure when her position was abolished in April of 1973.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">2. So far as appears, the vote of April, 1973, did not assign or offer to assign the plaintiff to any other duties;<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> it plainly cut her salary to zero. There was no compliance with any of the procedural provisions of G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 42, relating to the dismissal of tenured teachers. The master found, in so far as it was a question of fact, that the \u201c [p]laintiff was not dismissed by the\u201d committee within the meaning of or for the purposes of \u00a7 42. The judge ruled, in effect, that the vote was invalid by reason of the committee\u2019s failure to comply with \u00a7 42. We hold, on the authority of <em>Nutter </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Lowell, </em>decided this day, <em>ante, </em>77, 80-82 (1977), that the judge was right, that the plaintiff was dismissed in violation of the requirements of \u00a7 42, and that the judgment was correct in ordering that the plaintiff be compensated in damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>3. We think, however, that the committee is entitled to a further hearing in the Superior Court on the issue of mitigation of damages. See <em>Black </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Malden, </em>365 Mass. 197, 211-214 (1974), <em>S. C. </em>369 Mass. 657, 659-663 (1976). It is asserted in the committee\u2019s brief, and not denied in the plaintiff\u2019s brief, that there was evidence adduced before the master to the effect that the plaintiff was able to secure other employment as a librarian for some portion of the period subsequent to the conclusion of the school year 1972-1973. The master understandably ignored such evidence in his report because he came to the ultimate conclusion that the plaintiff was not tenured. The judge correctly reached a different ultimate conclusion on that point, but he took no evidence on the question of mitigation of damages (see Mass.R.Civ.P. 53 [e] [2], 365 Mass. 820 [1974]) and does not appear to have given any consideration to the question. Accordingly, the matter is to stand for further hearing by the court on the question of damages for the entire period from the conclusion of the school year 1972-1973 until such time as the plaintiff may be lawfully dismissed under and in accordance with the requirements of G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 42. See and compare <em>Nutter </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Lowell, supra </em>at 82-83.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">4. The relevant docket entries disclose that the committee has also appealed from the judge\u2019s denial of its motion for relief from judgment (Mass.R.Civ.P. 60[b]), filed some four months after the entry of judgment. Neither the motion nor its supporting affidavit has been reproduced in the appendix or in a supplemental appendix. See <em>Haddad </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Medford, </em>4 Mass. App. Ct. 843 (1976), and cases cited. So far as we can tell from the committee\u2019s brief, the motion did not raise any question not already considered in this opinion. We see no abuse of discretion in the denial of the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">The order denying the motion for relief from judgment is affirmed. The judgment is vacated, and the case is remanded to the Superior Court for the further proceedings required by this opinion and for the entry of a new final judgment which is otherwise consistent with this opinion. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>The plaintiff is to have costs of appeal, within the limitation imposed by G.
