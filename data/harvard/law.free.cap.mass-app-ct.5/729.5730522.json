See G. L. c. 276, \u00a7\u00a7 11-20R. A judge of the Superior Court denied the relief sought, and the petitioners have appealed. Their single contention on appeal, though presented in several variations, is that the documents which accompanied the Kansas demands are insufficient to establish probable cause that the petitioners committed the crimes charged, and thus that their arrests are invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-9\">The papers in question include a copy of a complaint, subscribed by two Kansas law enforcement officers and sworn to before a Kansas judge, which outlines in lengthy detail the facts surrounding and constituting the crimes charged and includes a list of witnesses, two of whom are the affiants. The papers also include an arrest warrant issued by the same judge, which recites his finding of probable cause to believe that the petitioners (among others) committed the offenses charged. Both the complaint and the warrant are properly authenticated and comply on their face with the requirements of G. L. c. 276, \u00a7 14. <em>Murphy, petitioner, </em>321 Mass. 206, 211-214 (1947). No contention is made that the petitioners are not the persons sought by Kansas. See <em>Maldonado, petitioner, </em>364 Mass. 359, 362 (1973). The sole question is whether probable cause has been sufficiently established.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-12\">We accept, for purposes of decision, the petitioners\u2019 contention that the sworn complaint, treated as an affidavit, could not by itself support a valid finding of probable cause because it does not furnish a basis for determining that the allegations made therein are based on personal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>knowledge of the affiants or reliable information imparted to them. See <em>Giordenello </em>v. <em>United States, </em>357 U. S. 480 (1958). From this it follows that the judge, who had before him no other evidence pertinent to reliability, could not have made an independent finding of probable cause; nor did he purport to do so. Rather, he credited (at least impliedly) the Kansas judge\u2019s finding, and it seems clear that he acted correctly in doing so.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-11\">\u201c[T]he Fourth Amendment requires a judicial determination of probable cause as a prerequisite to extended restraint of liberty following arrest.\u201d <em>Gerstein </em>v. <em>Pugh, </em>420 U. S. 103, 114 (1975). Interstate rendition involves an extended or significant restraint of liberty within the meaning of that rule and accordingly must be preceded by a judicial determination of probable cause. <em>Ierardi </em>v. <em>Gunter, </em>528 F. 2d 929, 930 (1st Cir. 1976). But the Fourth Amendment does not require that that determination be made in the courts of the asylum State. \u201cIf... the papers submitted by the [demanding State] were to show that a judicial officer or tribunal there had found probable cause, Massachusetts would not need to find probable cause anew, nor would it need to review the adequacy of the [demanding State\u2019s] determination. Instead, it would be entitled to rely on the official representations of its sister State that the requisite determination had been made; thus in our view Massachusetts may credit an arrest warrant shown to have been issued upon a finding of probable cause in [the demanding State] just as it would credit [the demanding State\u2019s] indictment.\u201d <em>Ierardi </em>v. <em>Gunter, supra </em>at 931. See also <em>Puopolo, petitioner, </em>372 Mass. 868 (1977); <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Helgemoe, </em>117 N.H. 91 (1977); <em>Pippin </em>v. <em>Leach, </em>189 Colo. 385, 390 (1975); <em>In re Golden, </em>65 Cal. App. 3d 789, 794-796, appeal dismissed and cert. denied sub nom. <em>Golden </em>v. <em>California, </em>434 U. S. 805 (1977).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b754-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>The briefs indicate that the parties attempted to introduce evidence as to the proceedings which were had before the Kansas court at the time of the issuance of the arrest warrant, apparently for the purpose of shedding light on whether the Kansas judge had a basis for his finding of probable cause other than the sworn complaint. The judge correctly declined to receive such testimony. Compare <em>Ger-main, petitioner, </em>258 Mass. 289, 297-299 <em>(1927); Ierardi, petitioner, </em>366 Mass. 640, 644 (1975). To do so would have violated the most elementary principles of comity. The courts of this State should ordinarily decline to review the regularity of judicial proceedings in other States.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> *3 Whatever may have been the practice in Kansas before <em>Gerstein </em>v. <em>Pugh, </em>we decline to assume that that case has escaped the attention of the Kansas courts and that the practice today is to issue arrest warrants without regard to a showing of probable cause. \u201cIt would be an act of unwarranted arrogance for us to ascribe to ourselves virtue superior to that of other courts and so to assert power to hear and determine the faithfulness to duty of a sister court occupying a place like ours in the federal system.\u201d <em>Garrison </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>413 F. Supp. 747, 757 (N.D. Miss. 1976), quoting <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Matthews, </em>182 F. 2d 677, 681 (D.C. Cir. 1950). In any event the Kansas judge\u2019s express <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>statement makes it clear that the question of probable cause was considered, and that probable cause was found, in these cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-5\">The record shows that the petitioners have been released on personal recognizance; thus, the entry in each case will be that judgments shall enter denying the writs and the petitioners shall be remanded to custody under the warrants of the Governor. <em>Murphy, petitioner, </em>321 Mass. 206, 215 (1947), and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b755-7\">This case was initially heard by a panel composed of Keville, Goodman and Armstrong, JJ., and was thereafter submitted on the record and briefs to the other Justices, all of whom took part in this decision in accordance with the provisions of Mass.R.A.P. 24 (a), 365 Mass. 872 (1974).</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b753-16\"> The petitioners also argue that we should adopt the rule of <em>Kirkland </em>v. <em>Preston, </em>385 F. 2d 670 (D.C. Cir. 1967), which seems (at 676) to permit the asylum State to credit a finding of probable cause made in the demanding State by a grand jury but not a finding of probable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>cause made in the demanding State by a judge. If that is a correct reading, we think the more tenable rule to be that of <em>Ierardi </em>v. <em>Gunter, </em>which, as shown in the text, differentiates instead between judicial findings of probable cause (whether by a judge or a grand jury) and nonjudicial findings of probable cause, as upon an information. For a discussion of the latter, see <em>Grano </em>v. <em>Delaware, </em>257 A.2d 768, 773-774 (Del. Super. 1969).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b754-6\"> The principle applies to this court no less than the trial court. We decline to consider the additional affidavits submitted by the parties after oral argument, confining our consideration to the correctness of the judge\u2019s rulings on the basis of the record before him. Were we to do otherwise, we would find the affidavits inconclusive even if accepted as true, because they furnish no basis for determining what is the critical question in such cases: namely, whether the oath taken by the officers comprehended only the contents of the affidavit or complaint or whether it also encompassed whatever oral representations were made to the judge at the time the complaint was sworn out (as to which we have no knowledge). See <em>Frazier </em>v. <em>Roberts, </em>441 F. 2d 1224, 1228 (8th Cir. 1971).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b755-8\">Goodman, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Ao70\">dissenting (with whom Brown, J., joins). It is submitted that the \u201ccomplaint\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and the \u201carrest warrant\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> in this case are an insufficient basis under the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution for the petitioners\u2019 arrest. The validity of this position depends on the extent to which the holding in <em>Ierardi, petitioner, </em>366 Mass. 640, 645 (1975), has been modified by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number><em>Gerstein </em>v. <em>Pugh, </em>420 U. S. 103 (1975). In <em>Ierardi, petitioner, supra, </em>the Supreme Judicial Court held that \u201c[wjhether there is probable cause to arrest can be fully litigated before the courts of the demanding State\u201d and permitted extradition to Florida on the basis of an information brought by a Florida prosecutor. No finding of probable cause in Florida or Massachusetts had been made prior to extradition. Subsequently, <em>Gerstein </em>v. <em>Pugh, </em>420 U. S. at 114, held that \u201cthe Fourth Amendment requires a judicial determination of probable cause as a prerequisite to extended restraint of liberty following arrest\u201d and ruled that the Florida procedure was violative of the Fourth Amendment. Under Florida procedure an arrest could be made pursuant to a capias based on a prosecutor\u2019s information, and the arrestee had no way of obtaining a judicial determination of probable cause for the arrest for at least thirty days. The Court said (at 124-125), \u201cWhatever procedure a State may adopt, it must provide a fair and reliable determination of probable cause as a condition for any significant pretrial restraint of liberty____\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b756-5\">In <em>Ierardi </em>v. <em>Gunter, </em>528 F. 2d 929, 930 (1st Cir. 1976), the Court of Appeals applied the <em>Gerstein </em>case to the extradition proceedings which had been considered in <em>Ierardi, petitioner. </em>It held that <em>\u201cGerstein </em>requires a judicial determination of probable cause as a prerequisite to interstate extradition. After <em>Gerstein </em>such a determination must precede \u2018any significant pretrial restraint of liberty,\u2019 420 U. S. at 125... and we think interstate extradition necessarily involves significant restraint.\u201d Accord, <em>Wellington </em>v. <em>South Dakota, </em>413 F. Supp. 151 (S.D.S.D. 1976) (following <em>Ierardi </em>v. <em>Gunter). </em>Contra, <em>In re Golden, </em>65 Cal. App. 3d 789, 794-796 (1977) (which does not mention <em>Ierardi </em>v. <em>Gunter). </em>The court in <em>Ierardi </em>v. <em>Gunter, supra </em>at 930, pointed out that \u201c[a]t best extradition means an extended period of detention, involving custody pending administrative arrangements in two states as well as forced travel in between. At worst it means separation from a familiar jurisdiction and effective denial of the support of family, friends and familiar advisors.\u201d That court thus <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>affirmed the grant of habeas corpus relief to Ierardi on the ground that \u201cthe rendition demand... did not embody the prior judicial determination of probable cause required by the fourth amendment, and the requisite determination had yet to be made\u201d (at 932).</p>\n<p id=\"b757-4\">The court noted (at 931) that its holding did not require that Massachusetts make its own determination of probable cause: \u201cMassachusetts may credit an arrest warrant shown to have issued upon a finding of probable cause in Florida just as it would credit a Florida indictment.\u201d This is quoted with approval in <em>Puopolo, petitioner, </em>372 Mass. 868 (1977), also an extradition case.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-5\">We therefore turn to the complaint and the arrest warrant in these cases to determine whether such a showing has in fact been made. The recitation in the arrest warrant of a finding of probable cause would ordinarily be determinative \u2014 assuming the continued rejection of <em>Kirkland </em>v. <em>Preston, </em>385 F. 2d 670 (D.C. Cir. 1967), which holds that the court of the asylum jurisdiction should review determinations of probable cause made in the demanding State. However, the significance of the Kansas finding and its limitation depend on Kansas procedure. It is the Kansas procedure which must supply the dictionary for determining the meaning in the arrest warrant of the symbols \u201cfinds that there is probable cause to believe.\u201d See <em>Moore, petitioner, </em>2 Mass. App. Ct. 399 (1974) (in which this court examined California procedure to determine the significance of a California information). Our examination of the Kansas statutes and case law leads us to conclude that the issuance in Kansas of an arrest warrant, though stated to be on a finding of probable cause, does not require such a determination as would pass muster under the Fourth Amendment. The Kansas Code of Criminal Procedure, Kan. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 22-2301 (1974), provides that \u201c[ujnless otherwise provided by law, a prosecution shall be commenced by filing a complaint with a magistrate.\u201d Section 22-2302 provides: \u201cIf the magistrate finds from the complaint, or from an affidavit or affidavits filed with the complaint or from other evidence, that there is probable cause <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>to believe both that a crime has been committed and that the defendant has committed it, a warrant for the arrest of the defendant shall issue.\u201d Further, Kan. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 22-3201 (1974) (see n.l) provides: \u201c(2) The complaint, information or indictment shall be a plain and concise written statement of the essential facts constituting the crime charged, which complaint, information or indictment, drawn in the language of the statute, shall be deemed sufficient.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b758-4\">The complaint is thus a charging document which needs do nothing more than set out a crime in the words of the statute.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Indeed, \u00a7 22-3201 provides that \u201c (3) The court may strike surplusage from the complaint, information or indictment.\u201d Nor need the magistrate require more. The court syllabus in <em>State </em>v. <em>Woods, </em>214 Kan. 739, 741 (1974), states: \u201cThe allegations of a complaint positively sworn to provide a magistrate with a sufficient basis for making the requisite finding of probable cause to issue a warrant for arrest.\u201d The court cites <em>State </em>v. <em>Carey, </em>56 Kan. 84, 87 (1895), in which it held that mere unqualified verification under oath was sufficient to foreclose any further inquiry as to knowledge of the person who swore to the complaint. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Addington, </em>205 Kan. 640, 644 (1970); <em>State </em>v. <em>Giddings, </em>216 Kan. 14, 16-17 <em>(1975); </em>Meyer, Arrest Under the New Kansas Criminal Code, 20 U. of Kan. L. Rev. 685, 690-697 (1972). And, as that article states (at 693), \u201cNormally, the warrant will be issued solely on the basis of a complaint filed with the magistrate.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>circumstances the issuance of an arrest warrant \u201cfrom the complaint\u201d filed by enforcement officers \u2014 despite the assertion of a finding of probable cause \u2014 can stand no better than the capias by the Florida court on the basis of the information filed by the prosecuting attorney. See <em>Ierardi </em>v. <em>Gunter, supra </em>at 929. To be sure the magistrate might have made a finding of probable cause on the basis of \u201caffidavits filed with the complaint or from other evidence ____\u201d Kan. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 22-2302. But from the arrest warrant before us (see n.2) it appears that there was nothing before the magistrate but the verified complaint. Indeed, both parties in response to inquiries at oral argument have submitted affidavits which agree that, as stated in the Assistant Attorney General\u2019s affidavit, \u201c[t]he context of the presentation of the complaint [to the magistrate] was informal and the responses made by Davis [who signed the complaint] were not under oath.\u201d The informal unsworn responses cannot avail to convert the complaint from a charging document to a showing of probable cause. U. S. Const, amend. IV. <em>Frazier </em>v. <em>Roberts, </em>441 F. 2d 1224, 1227-1228 (8th Cir. 1971).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b759-8\">We conclude that pursuant to the procedure here followed and sanctioned by the State of Kansas \u201c \u2018the inferences from the facts which lead to the complaint [and the arrest warrant] \u2019 [were] drawn not \u2018by a neutral and detached magistrate,\u2019 as the Constitution requires, but instead, by a police officer \u2018engaged in the often competitive enterprise of ferreting out crime,\u2019 <em>Giordenello </em>v. <em>United States, </em>[357 U. S. 480, 486 (1958)]____\u201d <em>Aguilar </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>378 U. S. 108, 115 (1964).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b755-10\"> The Kansas Code of Criminal Procedure defines a complaint as \u201ca written statement under oath of the essential facts constituting a crime....\u201d Kan.

Prosecutions in other courts shall be upon complaint.\u201d Effective January 10, 1977, \u00a7 22-3201 was amended to provide: \u201cProsecutions in the district <em>court </em>shall <em>be upon </em>complaint, indictment or information.\u201d Kan.
