(the insurer) from a judgment of the Superior Court awarding workmen\u2019s compensation to the employee. This action was originally heard by a single member who made findings favorable to the employee. The reviewing board issued its decision affirming, adopting, and supplementing the findings of the single member. On appeal a Superior Court judge recommitted the case to the board for several purposes, including the one that the board \u201cmake specific findings of subsidiary fact with respect to the issue of prejudice to the insurer by the delay in notice and late filing of claim.\u201d The board recommitted the case to the single member, who issued a second decision favorable to the employee. The reviewing board affirmed that decision arid ordered the insurers to pay the employee compensation. A judgment was entered in the Superior Court affirming the board\u2019s decision. The insurer appeals from that judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-14\">As part of his original decision the single member made the following findings of fact. The employee was employed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>at the Murray Brothers Tanning Co., Inc. (Murray Brothers) , from August, 1969, to January 17, 1970. In November, 1969, while working for Murray Brothers, the employee pulled a large piece of leather weighing about twenty-five pounds from a box; he slipped and fell backwards against a box, hitting himself at the waistline. Although in great pain, he finished out the day. The next day he stayed in bed. He then consulted a doctor. He remained out of work for two weeks because he had pain in his back and left leg. When Murray Brothers closed on January 17, 1970, he received unemployment compensation for three weeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">The employee began working for the Sutherland Foundry, Inc. (Sutherland), on April 5, 1970. His work at Sutherland consisted principally of shoveling sand with a shorthandled shovel for periods of up to eight hours a day. A shovel full of sand weighed up to ten pounds. The employee worked at Sutherland for about two months and was then given a vacation of one week. He could not return to work because of his back pain. In September, 1971, he underwent a laminectomy, but the surgery did not help him. He still has pain in his back and leg and is unable to work.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">The employee\u2019s doctor, Ronald F. Kaplan, testified, and the single member found, that the employee sustained an injury on November 2, 1969, while working for Murray Brothers. The injury was aggravated by the employee\u2019s work at Sutherland, causing the employee to be totally disabled from June 23, 1970. Dr. Kaplan stated in his report of November 15, 1972, and the single member found, that the employee still had a nerve root irritation. The employee had \u201creached an end result.\u201d The employee had a forty percent loss of function in his back and a thirty percent loss of function in both extremities.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-7\">At the original hearing the single member stated that the employee failed to give timely notice of his later injury to Sutherland, but that the insurer was not prejudiced by this nor by the employee\u2019s failure to file a timely claim. Although the single member made no finding as to the exact date the employee gave notice of that injury and filed his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>claim, Sutherland\u2019s foreman testified that he first learned of the injury when the insurer telephoned him on April 12, 1972, to verify the fact that the employee had worked at Sutherland. Following the recommittal of the case to the single member by the Superior Court and reviewing board, the single member supplemented his findings on this issue as follows. He found that within two or three weeks after stopping work at Sutherland the employee consulted Dr. Ralph Lepore. Shortly thereafter he was referred to Dr. George M. Hazel and Dr. Peter H. Dillard. He later underwent back surgery. The single member added that the insurer had available to it many medical reports which it could use to defend its position. The single member also found that the president and the foreman of Sutherland had either full knowledge or an opportunity to know of the conditions under which the employee worked.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">1. The board\u2019s decision as to whether the employee\u2019s injury was causally related to his work at Sutherland must be sustained \u201cunless... wholly lacking in evidential support or tainted by error of law____\u201d <em>Hachadourian's Case, </em>340 Mass. 81, 85 (1959). There was ample expert opinion testimony to warrant the finding that the employee\u2019s previous back injury was aggravated by work at Sutherland, his last place of employment. Compare <em>Trombetta\u2019s Case, </em>1 Mass. App. Ct. 102 (1973). Therefore, no error was committed in holding Sutherland\u2019s insurer liable under the rule that \u201cthe insurer covering the risk at the time of the most recent injury bearing a causal relation to the disability must pay the entire compensation.\u201d <em>Trombetta\u2019s Case, supra, </em>at 104, citing <em>Evan\u2019s Case, </em>299 Mass. 435, 438 (1938).</p>\n<p id=\"b476-8\">2. The insurer\u2019s argument that the record is insufficient to establish a causal relationship between the employee\u2019s loss of bodily function and disfigurement, found compensable by the board under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 36, as appearing in St. 1972, c. 741, \u00a7 1, and his employment with Sutherland is also without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-9\">3. The insurer argues that the evidence is not sufficient to support the board\u2019s conclusion that the employee was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>disabled during the period between June 23, 1970, and January 31, 1971. The board\u2019s conclusion is adequately supported by the testimony of the employee and the employee\u2019s doctor, Ronald F. Kaplan.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">4. The insurer\u2019s principal argument is that the employee has failed to sustain his burden of proving under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7\u00a744 and 49, that the insurer was not prejudiced by the employee\u2019s failure to give it or the employer timely notice of his injury or of his claim for compensation. See and compare <em>Kangas\u2019s Case, </em>282 Mass. 155, 158-159 (1933); <em>Russell\u2019s Case, </em>334 Mass. 680, 682-684 (1956). The insurer can be prejudiced by the employee\u2019s failure to receive prompt medical care which causes his condition to deteriorate. See <em>Robinson\u2019s Case, </em>354 Mass. 282, 284 (1968). See also Locke, Workmen\u2019s Compensation \u00a7 451 (1968). The single member\u2019s finding that the employee consulted with several doctors \u201cwithin two or three weeks after stopping work at the Sutherland Foundry\u201d indicates that we are not presented with this kind of prejudice in the instant case. Compare <em>Channell\u2019s Case, </em>337 Mass. 124, 128 (1958); <em>Mahoney\u2019s Case, </em>337 Mass. 629, 632 (1958); <em>Davidson\u2019s Case, </em>338 Mass. 228, 231-232 (1958), and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">The absence of prompt medical treatment, however, is not the only possible type of prejudice. <em>Curtin\u2019s Case, </em>354 Mass. 45, 47 (1968). The insurer is prejudiced if it was unable to conduct a thorough investigation and procure evidence on the question whether \u201cthere was a causal connection between the employment and the injury.\u201d <em>Zabec\u2019s Case, </em>302 Mass. 465, 467 (1939). See <em>Robinson\u2019s Case, supra. </em>Compare <em>Hatch\u2019s Case, </em>290 Mass. 259, 262-263 (1935).</p>\n<p id=\"b477-7\">This type of prejudice most frequently arises when the employee\u2019s injury is caused by a single incident. E.g., <em>Kan-gas\u2019s Case, </em>282 Mass. 155 (1933); <em>Hatch\u2019s Case, </em>290 Mass. 259 (1935). In such circumstances \u201cthe rights of the insurer might be impaired if it were kept in ignorance of [the] occurrence and so prevented from conducting an investigation to determine whether such an event had in fact taken place and, if it had, to ascertain all the attending <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>circumstances, including an inquiry as to whether there was a causal connection between the employment and the injury and between the injury and the disability.\u201d <em>Zabec\u2019s Case, </em>302 Mass. at 467. As the employee\u2019s aggravation of his previous back injury took place over a period of several weeks, and the employee\u2019s foreman was available and did testify as to the nature of the defendant\u2019s employment during that period, the insurer cannot effectively argue that it was prejudiced by its inability to offer evidence on the work conditions which the employee claims caused his disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">On the other hand, many of the cases holding that the insurer was not prejudiced by the employee\u2019s failure to give it timely notice involve employees whose disability had been caused by an occupational disease. E.g., <em>Watson\u2019s Case, </em>322 Mass. 581, 584 (1948) ; <em>Tassone\u2019s Case, </em>330 Mass. 545, 548 (1953); <em>Charron\u2019s Case, </em>331 Mass. 519, 521 (1954). In those cases the causal link between the employment and the disability was fairly obvious. Such is not the case when, as in the instant case, a back injury is the cause of the disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">In the final analysis, the question whether the employee\u2019s failure promptly to inform the insurer of his claim may have prevented the insurer from being able to procure needed evidence is a factual question for the board. <em>Therrien\u2019s Case, </em>2 Mass. App. Ct. 795 (1974). However, in the instant case the board\u2019s findings, particularly as to the availability of medical records (see <em>Wheaton\u2019s Case, </em>310 Mass. 504, 507 [1941]), are conclusory and not supported by adequate subsidiary findings. <em>Garrigan\u2019s Case, </em>341 Mass. 413, 419 (1960). <em>Thibeault\u2019s Case, </em>341 Mass. 647, 652 (1961). <em>Lendall\u2019s Case, </em>342 Mass. 642,648 (1961). The single member found that the employee consulted with at least three doctors within a few weeks after stopping work at Sutherland, but none of the medical reports of these doctors was introduced in evidence by the employee. The earliest medical record introduced in evidence was the report of the hospital in which the employee had had his op<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>eration. That report was prepared<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> over seven months after the time during which the single member found that the aggravation of the employee\u2019s back condition took place.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">It is our conclusion that the single member failed to give adequate consideration to the instructions of the first Superior Court judge that the board make more \u201cspecific findings of subsidiary fact with respect to the issue of prejudice.\u201d See <em>Zabec\u2019s Case, </em>302 Mass. at 469, and cases cited. Accordingly, the judgment is reversed, and the case is to be remanded to the board for further findings on the issue of possible prejudice arising from the employee\u2019s failure to give the insurer prompt notice of his claim. See <em>Berthiaume\u2019s Case, </em>328 Mass. 186, 191 (1951).</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b479-13\"> The employee was admitted to Choate Memorial Hospital on January 31,1971.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
