App. Ct. 725, 728-729 [1976]) and (b) the statements of fact in the appellant\u2019s brief which are not supported by anything found in the record <em>(Currens </em>v. <em>Assessors of Boston, </em>370 Mass. 249, 254 [1976]) and (2) concentrate on the master\u2019s report (which was not reproduced in the appendix; see <em>Haddad v. Board of Appeals of Medford, </em>4 Mass. App. Ct. 843 [1976]) we discover that no substantial question of law is presented by the appeal. If the true character of the appeal had been discovered prior to the time the case was noticed for argument, the judgment would have been summarily affirmed under Rule 1:28 of the Appeals Court, 3 Mass. App. Ct. 806 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b227-14\">Counsel are advised that we are not precluded from acting under that rule merely because we entertain oral <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>argument.
