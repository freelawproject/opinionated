The plaintiff has appealed from a judgment adverse to it. There was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-13\">The facts are not in dispute. The city invited sealed bids in connection with the \u201cSouth End Sewer R\u201d project. The invitation for bids provided that a \u201cCertification of Bidder Regarding Equal Employment Opportunity\u201d must accompany all bids. It also provided, \u201cthe owner may consider normal any bid not prepared and submitted in ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>cordance with the provisions hereof and may waive any informalities____\u201d Part III, \u00a7 301 of Exec. Order No. 11246, 3 C.F.R. 174 (Supp. 1965), reprinted in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e app., at 10296 (1970), required as a condition for approval of an application for a grant for Federal assistance for a public works project that the applicant agree to include the above mentioned certification in the construction contract. The present contract was to be paid for, in part, by such funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">When the bids filed pursuant to the invitation were opened it appeared that the plaintiff was the third lowest bidder. The two lower bidders had not submitted the required certification with their bids. The city, however, permitted the lowest bidder to file its certificate prior to the awarding of the contract. That having been done, the contract was awarded to the lowest bidder.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-7\">As no question has been raised with respect to the qualifications of any of the bidders or that any of them was other than responsible, the. only issue for our determination is whether the failure to submit the required certification with the bids rendered the two lowest bidders ineligible and thus disqualified their bids from consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-8\">We agree with the judge\u2019s conclusion that the failure to file that certification along with the bids was an informality that the city had expressly reserved the right to waive. No State or Federal law or regulation required that the certification be filed with the bids. In fact, there was no'State requirement that such a certification be filed at all. The only reference in the executive order with respect to such a certification was that it be included in the contract. That inclusion appears to have been accomplished here.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-9\">We are of the opinion that although the bidding procedure in the present case was pursuant to G. L. c. 30, \u00a7 39M, rather than G. L. c. 149, \u00a7\u00a7 44A-44L, this case is governed by the reasoning and holding in <em>Gil-Bern Constr. Corp. </em>v. Brockton, 353 Mass. 503, 505-507 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b414-10\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
