The plaintiff claimed a timely appeal to the review board appointed by the Commissioner of Public Safety pursuant to G. L. c. 22, \u00a7 9R,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and the rules and regulations governing the Massachusetts State police.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The review board \u201cvoted not to change sufficient answers given by [the plaintiff] to raise his grade on the examination so as to make him eligible for promotion to lieutenant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b212-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>The defendants moved to dismiss the complaint on the grounds of lack of subject matter jurisdiction and failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. Mass.R.Civ.P. 12(b) (1), (6), 365 Mass. 755 (1974). The plaintiff has appealed from the judgment which followed the allowance of that motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">This case falls within the narrow class of cases exemplified by <em>County of Dukes County </em>v. <em>New Bedford, Woods Hole, Martha's Vineyard &amp; Nantucket S.S. Authy. </em>333 Mass. 405 (1956), in which it was stated at 406-407: \u201cOrdinarily a demurrer cannot properly be sustained to a bill for a declaratory decree on the ground that the court does not agree with the proposition for which the plaintiff contends. Usually a declaratory decree should be made in any event. <em>Burnes </em>v. <em>Metropolitan District Commission, </em>325 Mass. 731, 733 [1950]. <em>Zaltman </em>v. <em>Daris, </em>331 Mass. 458 [1954]. <em>Morgan </em>v. <em>Banas, </em>331 Mass. 694, 698 [1954]. But where the plaintiff has failed to state a case presenting a controversy proper for determination under the declaratory procedure there is no reason why a demurrer may not be sustained. It may well be doubted whether a proper case was here presented. But we do not think it necessary to decide the question whether as a technical matter the demurrer of the city was rightly sustained. The appeals from the final decree brought here the question of discretion whether a declaratory decree ought to be entered. <em>Merchants Mutual Casualty Co. </em>v. <em>Leone, </em>298 Mass. 96, 99-100 [1937]. <em>Hogan </em>v. <em>Hogan, </em>320 Mass. 658, 662-663 [1947] . <em>Carlton Hotel, Inc. </em>v. <em>Abrams, </em>322 Mass. 201 [1948] . G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 231A, \u00a7 3.\u201d We are of the opinion that the present case falls within the authority of the <em>County of Dukes County </em>case and that the declaratory and other relief requested should not be granted for the reasons stated below.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-8\">The examination was made up of 100 questions which required multiple choice answers. The plaintiff states that his answers to thirty-eight of these were marked wrong. He alleges that in twenty-four of the thirty-eight the questions \u201cwere so vague and indefinite as to be incomprehen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>sible and/or the answers given by petitioner thereto were correct and should not have been marked wrong.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">We have reviewed the disputed questions and, despite the typographical and grammatical errors which appear in some of them, we do not find them \u201cso vague and indefinite as to be incomprehensible.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">Thus, the complaint is left with the allegation that the answers given by the plaintiff to certain questions were incorrectly marked wrong. The defendant had broad discretion not only in determining what questions to ask but also in determining what the correct answers to those questions were. In a case such as the present where there is no allegation of discrimination or arbitrariness in the way the examination was given, corrected or reviewed on appeal (see <em>Greenberg </em>v. <em>Assessors of Cambridge, </em>360 Mass. 418, 422 [1971]), the correctness of the marking of answers to an administrative examination raises no question of law for review by a court. See <em>Barry </em>v. <em>Civil Serv. Commn. </em>323 Mass. 431, 433-434 (1948); <em>Ferguson </em>v. <em>Civil Serv. Commn. </em>344 Mass. 484, 487-488 (1962); <em>Sharkey </em>v. <em>Civil Serv. Commn. </em>357 Mass. 785 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b213-7\">The plaintiff has been afforded the protection of the appeal process provided by the provisions of G. L. c. 22, \u00a7 9R, and the rules and regulations promulgated pursuant to that statute\u2019s mandate. On the posture of the case as it comes to us, the plaintiff would have us reverse the judgment and return the case to the Superior Court where a judge of that court would be required to review and recorrect the plaintiff\u2019s examination papers. That, in the exercise of our discretion, we decline to do. See <em>County of Dukes County </em>v. <em>New Bedford, Woods Hole, Martha\u2019s Vineyard &amp; Nantucket S.S. Authy. </em>333 Mass. at 409; <em>Employers Mut. Liab. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Ford Motor Co. </em>335 Mass. 504, 506 (1957); <em>James Constr. Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Pub.
