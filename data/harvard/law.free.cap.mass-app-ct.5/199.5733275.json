Claims were filed with the Industrial Accident Board against both Continental, as the insurer of Ashland Excavating Company, Inc. (Ashland), and Lumbermens Mutual Casualty Company (Lumbermens), as the insurer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>for A: J. Lane Construction Corp. (Lane) .<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The reviewing board affirmed and adopted the findings and decision of the single member and ordered Lumbermens to pay the claim for compensation. On Lumbermens\u2019 appeal to the Superior Court the judge reversed the decision of the reviewing board and entered a judgment ordering Continental to pay the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">The parties do not contest the decision of the board that Ramsey\u2019s death is compensable under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act, G. L. c. 152. The issue is which of the two insurers is liable as the insurer of Ramsey\u2019s employer, and in that connection whether the last paragraph of G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 18, inserted by St. 1969, c. 755, \u00a7 2,1 <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> is applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">The single member, to whose decision we look (see <em>Russo\u2019s Case, </em>1 Mass. App. Ct. 206 [1973]), found that Ashland, which was in the earth moving and machinery rental business, sold a bulldozer to Lane about two weeks before August 30, 1972, the date of Ramsey\u2019s death while at work. At the time of the sale Lane \u201crequested [that] Ashland loan them [Lane] an operator to run this bulldozer until Lane could get one of their own, because Lane was short an operator. Ashland did supply this operator... Ramsey.\u201d Ramsey had been carried on Ashland\u2019s payroll <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>\u201cfor about two years prior to, and including, August 30, 1972. Ashland withheld State and Federal taxes and Social Security deductions for this employee, and also paid its share of Social Security taxes.\u201d Ramsey continued to be paid the same each week plus overtime. Under the arrangement between Ashland and Lane, Ramsey would make out his own time card for the time worked with Lane and give the card to Ashland. Ashland would make out the payroll and bill Lane for the hours Ramsey had turned in as having worked. Ashland would bill Lane \u201cprobably $2.00 more an hour\u201d over Ramsey\u2019s hourly rate of $6.75 an hour. The single member also found that \"[apparently it was a common practice to exchange operators as needed between similar types of businesses, as they have more machinery than operators.\u201d The arrangement was to continue \u201cuntil Ashland needed him [Ramsey] or until Lane obtained another operator.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">The single member further found that on August 30, 1972, Ramsey \u201cwas under the direct control and supervision\u201d of Lane and that on that date \u201cRamsey was an employee of\u201d Lane, whose insurer, Lumbermens, was ordered to pay the claim for compensation. The single member further found that \u201cRamsey was not an employee of Ash-land Excavating Company as of August 30, 1972,\u201d and dismissed the claim against Continental. We agree with the trial judge that the board (which affirmed and adopted the decision of the single member) was in error; we affirm the judgment which dismissed the claim against Lumbermens as the insurer of Lane, properly characterized by the trial judge as \u201ca special employer,\u201d and which ordered that the claim be paid by Continental, the insurer of Ash-land, designated as the \u201cGeneral Employer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">It is familiar law that on judicial review the findings and decision of the reviewing board are final unless they are wholly lacking in evidential support or tainted by error of law. <em>Nowak\u2019s Case, </em>2 Mass. App. Ct. 498, 499 (1974). \u201cThe general findings of the board are to be sustained unless different findings are required as matter of law.\u201d <em>McGilvray\u2019s Case, </em>355 Mass. 447, 448 (1969). Here, how<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>ever, the subsidiary findings made by the single member as to the relationships between Ramsey and Ashland and between Ashland and Lane preclude, as matter of law, the unqualified general finding that Ramsey was \u201cnot an employee of Ashland.\u201d Those subsidiary findings compel a finding that Ramsey, at the time in question, though a special employee of Lane, was in the general employ of Ashland. Nor would the evidence in the transcript before us support any other view. See <em>Brooks\u2019s Case, </em>338 Mass. 692, 693 (1959). See also <em>Campinha </em>v. <em>James J. Devine, Inc. </em>1 Mass. App. Ct. 482, 483-484 (1973). Cf. <em>Canavan\u2019s Case, </em>364 Mass. 762, 766-767 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">Continental does not seriously dispute that Ramsey was an employee loaned by Ashland to Lane. The status of such an employee has long been recognized in our law. In <em>Galloway\u2019s Case, </em>354 Mass. 427, 430 (1968), the court said, quoting from <em>Langevin\u2019s Case, </em>326 Mass. 43, 47-48 (1950): \u201cIn <em>Coughlan </em>v. <em>Cambridge, </em>166 Mass. 268, 277 [1896], this court said, \u2018It is well settled that one who is the general servant of another may be lent or hired by his master to another for some special service, so as to become as to that service the servant of such third party.\u2019 \u201d The court followed the common law test set out in <em>Langevin\u2019s Case </em>and in <em>Coughlan: </em>\u2014\u201c[Wjhether in the particular service which he is engaged to perform, he continues liable to the direction and control of his master or becomes subject to that of the party to whom he is lent or hired.\u201d <em>Galloway\u2019s Case </em>held that where an agency engaged in the business of supplying temporary help had supplied a clerk-typist to another company, Sylvania, under an arrangement similar to that in our case and she was injured while on the job, the insurer of Sylvania (to the direction and control of which she was subject), rather than the agency which was her general employer, was hable under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">Continental contends that the same result should be reached in this case despite the subsequent enactment of St. 1969, c. 755, which made specific provisions for situations \u201cwhere there shall exist with respect to an employee <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>a general employer and a special employer relationship\u201d and generally places the primary liability on the insurer of the general employer. (See fn. <em>2, supra.) </em>Continental argues that the statute was a response to <em>Galloway\u2019s Case </em>and should be confined to \u201cso-called employment agency cases.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">It may well be that legislative concern was precipitated by the particular difficulties created by that case for the labor service industry as well as for employees supplied to uninsured special employers.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> See Locke, Workmen\u2019s Compensation, \u00a7 156 (Supp. 1975). But the distinction between \u201cgeneral employer\u201d and \u201cspecial employer\u201d has been with us since long before the development of the modem labor service industry. It appears in a workmen\u2019s compensation context at least as early as <em>Scribner\u2019s Case, </em>231 Mass. 132, 135 (1918), in which the court adhered to the common law criteria of control and assent by the employee in imposing liability as between \u201ca special employer as distinguished from his [a \u201clent\u201d employee\u2019s] general employer.\u201d The 1969 statute, in minimizing the use of these criteria by imposing primary liability on the general employer, thus addresses broadly the uncertainty and consequent litigation which has resulted from the use of these criteria. See, e.g., <em>Chisholm\u2019s Case, </em>238 Mass. 412, 419-421 <em>(1921); Wall\u2019s Case, </em>293 Mass. 93 (1935); <em>Langevin\u2019s Case, </em>326 Mass. 43, 47-48 (1950); <em>Keaney\u2019s Case, </em>341 Mass. 571 (1960); <em>Sargentelli\u2019s Case, </em>331 Mass. 193 (1954); <em>Brooks\u2019s Case, </em>338 Mass. 692 (1959). Cf. <em>Sawtelle </em>v. <em>Mystic Valley Gas. Co. </em>1 Mass. App. Ct. 672, 675-677 (1974). It has been said: \u201cThe law that defines or seeks to define the distinction between general and special employers is beset with distinctions so delicate that chaos is the consequence. No lawyer can say with assurance in any given situation when one employment ends and the other begins.\u201d Cardozo, A Ministry of Justice, 35 Harv. L. Rev. 113, 121 (1921).</p>\n<p id=\"b226-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>The 1969 statute, as indicated by its title (see fn. 2, supra), deals in terms of the broad categories of \u201cgeneral employer\u201d and \u201cspecial employer.\u201d There is no such limitation to \u201ca person who for consideration and as the regular course of his business supplies an employee... to another person,\u201d as is found in the Rhode Island statute dealing with this problem. R.I. General Laws, 1956 (1968 Reenactment) , \u00a7 28-29-2 (d) (inserted by 1960 R.I. Pub. Laws, c. 182, \u00a7 <em>1;</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> </em>see 1970 R.I. Pub. Laws, c. 277, \u00a7 2). Further, the statute speaks broadly of <em>\u201cany case </em>where there shall exist with respect to an employee a general employer and a special employer relationship...\u201d (emphasis supplied). G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 18 (as amended by St. 1969, c. 755, \u00a7 2). Similarly, the definition of \u201cemployer\u201d in the amended statute includes \u201cboth the general employer and the special employer in <em>any case </em>where both relationships exist with respect to an employee\u201d (emphasis supplied). G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 1 (5) (as amended by St. 1969, c. 755, \u00a7 1) .<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">Accordingly, the judgment of the Superior Court is affirmed. Costs of this appeal are to be determined under G.

L. c. 152, \u00a7 1(5): \u201cThe word \u2018employer\u2019 shall include both the general employer and the special employer in any case where both relationships exist with respect to an employee.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b225-6\"> <em>Galloway\u2019s Case, supra, </em>and the 1969 statute antedate the broad compulsory coverage extended by St. 1972, c. 374, \u00a7 1 (amending G.
