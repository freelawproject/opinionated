L. c. 149, \u00a7 27F,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and was submitted to the Superior Court on a statement of agreed facts, the essence of which may be summarized as follows. On June 25, 1974, the defendant entered into a contract in writing with the city of Boston, acting through its department of public works, under which the defendant agreed to furnish motorized street sweepers with their operators for the purpose of keeping the streets clean in a specified section of the city. The contract provided that the defendant should pay the operators of the sweepers at the aggregate hourly rate of $6.33, representing $6.00 by way of straight wages and $.33 in lieu of payments to health and welfare plans. The components of that rate had been requested of and prescribed by the Commissioner of Labor and Industries (Commissioner), and had been specifically included in the contract, in accordance with the procedures contemplated by the first paragraph of \u00a7 27F. It was subsequently discovered, and it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>is now agreed, that the defendant paid all the operators at rates less than $6.33 per hour.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">The Commissioner secured from the Municipal Court of the City of Boston nine complaints charging the defendant with violations of \u00a7 27F. The defendant was convicted on all the complaints and appealed to the Superior Court, where the single complaint now before us was submitted on the agreed facts already summarized. A Municipal Court judge, sitting in the Superior Court under statutory authority, has reported for our determination the question whether a contract such as the one already described is subject to the provisions of \u00a7 27F.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">The parties, the amicus curiae and we are all in agreement that the critical question is whether the sweeping of public ways is \u201cpublic\u201d work within the meaning of \u00a7 27F. There is no legislative history which is of any assistance in answering that question.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Commonwealth\u2019s argument in favor of the Commissioner\u2019s administrative interpretation of the statute is unpersuasive because the record is silent as to any prior occasion on which the Commissioner may have considered circumstances similar to those of the present case.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Contrast <em>Gillis </em>v. <em>Mass. Cablevision, Inc. </em>369 Mass. 526, 531, 534 (1976). The defendant bases its argument in part on abstract lexical definitions of \u201cpublic works.\u201d See Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>1836 (1971 ed.) ;<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1781 (4th ed. rev. 1968). The parties and the amicus have cited numerous cases from other jurisdictions, none of which was concerned with a statute bearing any close resemblance to \u00a7 27F. \u201cNeither answer to [the reported] question can be shown overwhelmingly to be correct, but we think the [Commonwealth\u2019s] position is to be preferred.\u201d <em>Eastman Kodak Co. </em>v. <em>Clerk of the Third Dist. Ct. of E. Middle-sex, </em>372 Mass. 232, 235 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">The sweeping of public ways by motorized equipment is a function which, like street sprinkling (G. L. c. 40, \u00a7 16), is commonly performed by or under the direction of superintendents of streets and boards and departments of public works in cities and towns. See G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 \u00a7 21, 66, 68 and 69. It is a function akin to several of those which the Department of Public Works of the Commonwealth (DPW) is specifically required to perform in the maintenance of State highways, and which often require the use of trucks and related equipment. See G. L. c. 81, \u00a7\u00a713 (removal of brush) and 14 (removal of trees, tree limbs and shrubbery bordering State highways). See, generally, c. 81, \u00a7 15. It is common knowledge that all the types of work just referred to can be, and often are, performed by private contractors using their own employees and equipment rather than by the public labor force using publicly owned equipment. It appears to be common ground that the street sweeping equipment here in question fell within the ambit of G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 27F, and we have no doubt that the work called for by the contract was \u201cpublic\u201d in the sense in which that word is used in the section.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">The defendant\u2019s principal argument against the applicability of \u00a7 27F is that implicit in the words \u201cpublic works\u201d is the concept of \u201cconstruction,\u201d a factor which is noticeably absent from the present case. We think the argument overlooks the framework and the subject matter of related <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>provisions found in G. L. c. 149 (\u201cLABOR AND INDUSTRIES\u201d) . Section 27F was inserted in the subdivision of c. 149 which is entitled \u201cPUBLIC EMPLOYMENT\u201d (see <em>Gallagher </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd. 4 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 1, 6, 7 [1976]), at a point almost immediately following \u00a7\u00a726 through 27D of that chapter, as then in effect.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Each of those sections was, and still is, concerned in one way or another with the payment of minimum wages prescribed by the Commissioner to public employees as well as the employees of private contractors who are engaged in the construction of public works. Those sections were, and still are, interlaced with copious variations of the phrases \u201cconstruction of public works\u201d (\u00a7\u00a726, 27 and 27C), and \u201cpublic works to be constructed\u201d (\u00a7\u00a726, 27 and 27A). The words \u201cconstruction\u201d and \u201cconstructed\u201d were, and still are, defined to include \u201cadditions to and alterations of public works\u201d (\u00a7 27D)<footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Sections 26 through 27D provided, and still provide, a comprehensive statutory scheme requiring the payment of the prescribed minimum wages to practically all employees, public or private, who are engaged in the \u201cconstruction\u201d of public works. It was in the light of this explicit background (see <em>Commissioner of Labor &amp; Indus. </em>v. <em>Boston Housing Authy. </em>345 Mass. 406, 415 [1963] ) that the Legislature selected the unqualified words \u201cpublic works\u201d which are found in \u00a7 27F. If the intention was that the prescribed wage provisions of that section should be limited in their application to employees engaged in public works involving \u201cconstruction,\u201d the new section would have been completely unnecessary. See <em>Insurance Rating Bd. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins. </em>356 Mass. 184, 189 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b443-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>It is arguable, of course, that if the Legislature had intended to include work such as the sweeping of public ways within the ambit of \u00a7 27F, it would have said so explicitly (see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hayes, </em>372 Mass. 505, 509-510 [1977]), but we see no occasion for invoking the principle that an ambiguous penal statute is to be strictly construed against the Commonwealth. See <em>Davey Bros. Inc. </em>v. <em>Stop &amp; Shop, Inc. </em>351 Mass. 59, 63 (1966); <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>372 Mass. 874, 876 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">We answer the question reported (see note 2, <em>supra) </em>in the affirmative.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b439-6\"> General Laws c. 149, \u00a7 27F, inserted by St. 1960, c. 795, reads: \u201cNo agreement of lease, rental or other arrangement, and no order or requisition under which a truck or any automotive or other vehicle or equipment is to be engaged in public works by the commonwealth or by a county, city, town or district, shall be entered into or given by any public official or public body unless said agreement, order or requisition contains a stipulation requiring prescribed rates of wages, as determined by the commissioner, to be paid to the operators of said trucks, vehicles or equipment. Any such agreement, order or requisition which does not contain said stipulation shall be invalid, and no payment shall be made thereunder. Said rates of wages shall be requested of said commissioner by said public official or public body, and shall be furnished by the commissioner in a schedule containing the classifications of jobs, and the rate of wages to be paid for each job. Said rates of wages shall include payments to health and welfare plans, or, if no such plan is in effect between employers and employees, the amount of such payments shall be paid directly to said operators.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-7\">\u201cWhoever pays less than said rates of wages, including payments to health and welfare funds, or the equivalent in wages, on said works, and whoever accepts for his own use, or for the use of any other person, as a rebate, gratuity or in any other guise, any part or portion of said wages or health and welfare funds, shall be punished by a fine of not less than one hundred dollars nor more than five hundred dollars.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b440-7\"> The question actually posed by the judge is, \u201cDoes Mass. Gen. Laws, Chapt. 149, Section 27F apply to a street sweeping contract... or is such a contract, a contract for public services and not public works?\u201d As indicated in the text of our opinion, we confine our consideration to the first branch of the question. If \u00a7 27F does not apply to the circumstances of this case, there is no need to determine whether the contract in question should be characterized as one \u201cfor public services.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b440-8\"> See .1959 Senate Doc.
