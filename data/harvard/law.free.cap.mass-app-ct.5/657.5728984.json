L. c. 269, \u00a7 10 <em>(a). </em>He was found guilty by a jury and sentenced. The defendant assigns as error the judge\u2019s denial of his motion for a directed verdict. The argument is divided into two parts.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-14\">1. The defendant contends that his motion for a directed verdict should have been allowed because G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 7, relied on by the Commonwealth at trial, is unconstitutional.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> That point has been decided adversely to the de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>fendant in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>372 Mass. 403 (1977), and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>372 Mass. 411 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">2. The defendant argues that the evidence presented by the Commonwealth was insufficient to warrant the submission of the case to the jury. We agree and reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">The standard of review is whether the evidence, read in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Perry, </em>3 Mass. App. Ct. 308, 312 (1975), is such that the jury \u201cmight properly draw inferences, not too remote in the ordinary course of events, or forbidden by any rule of law, and conclude upon all the established circumstances and warranted inferences that the guilt of the defendant was proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vellucci, </em>284 Mass. 443, 445 (1933).</p>\n<p id=\"b680-7\">Viewed in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, the evidence showed that in response to a radio call six Boston police officers went to an apartment building in Boston\u2019s Back Bay. Officer Daly testified that as he entered the building he observed a group of men arguing in the hallway. Although the men were speaking Greek, Officer Daly heard the defendant say, \u201cIt was only shooting blanks.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Officer Daly then approached the defendant and asked him where the gun was. The defendant answered that it was in his room. At the defendant\u2019s invitation Officer Daly accompanied him into his room and saw a gun lying on the bed. Daly picked up the gun, put it in his pocket, and arrested the defendant. After being transported to the police station and being read his Miranda rights, the defendant, in response to police questioning, admitted that he had bought the gun in New York. There was no evidence of when or how the gun got to the defendant\u2019s room. At the close of the Commonwealth\u2019s case, the defendant made a motion for a directed verdict on the ground that there had been no evidence that he had carried the firearm on his person.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-8\">The issue before us is the meaning of the word \u201ccarry<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>ing\u201d as used in G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10 (a) .<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Supreme Judicial Court has said that the \u201cidea conveyed by the statute is that of movement,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Atencio, </em>345 Mass. 627, 631 (1963), and that \u201ctemporary possession [of a firearm] during the actual shooting would not be sufficient under the statute____\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Morrissey, </em>351 Mass. 505, 512 (1967).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In the instant case the evidence showed only \u201ctemporary possession\u201d during firing and no \u201cmovement\u201d at all. The police heard no shots. There was no evidence to indicate where the shots (or blanks) were discharged. The police found the defendant in the hallway, but the gun was found in the defendant\u2019s bedroom. There was no evidence from which to infer that the defendant had carried it outside his room. The only legitimate inference is that the defendant had picked up the gun and held it while he fired it, but such temporary possession was not sufficient for conviction of unlawfully carrying a firearm. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Atencio, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b681-6\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b681-7\">\n<em>Verdict set aside.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b681-8\">\n<em>Judgment for the defendant.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b679-15\"> General Laws c. 278, \u00a7 7, reads: \u201cA defendant in a criminal prosecution, relying for his justification upon a license, appointment, admission to practice as an attorney at law, or authority, shall prove the same; and, until so proved, the presumption shall be that he is not so authorized.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b680-9\"> All other references to this statement seem to indicate that the defendant said, <em>\u201cI </em>was only shooting blanks.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b681-9\"> Subsection <em>(a) </em>of \u00a7 10, as appearing in St. 1975, c. 113, \u00a7 2, provides in pertinent part: \u201cWhoever... carries on his person ... a firearm ... without [license] ... shall be punished ....\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b681-10\"> We note that none of the subsequent amendments to G.
