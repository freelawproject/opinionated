L. c. 265, \u00a7 22A, as appearing in St. 1974, c. 474, \u00a7 2, which provides: \u201cWhoever has sexual intercourse or unnatural sexual intercourse with a child under sixteen, and compels said child to submit by force and against his will or compels said child to submit by threat of bodily injury, shall be punished by imprisonment ... for life or for any term of years; and whoever over the age of eighteen commits a second or subsequent such offense shall be sentenced to the state prison for life or for any term of years, but not less than five years.\u201d The indictment specifically charges the defendant with having had \u201cunnatural sexual intercourse\u201d with a named person.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-8\">The defendant moved (a) for particulars as to the \u201cspecific act relied upon by the Commonwealth to support the allegation set forth\u201d in the indictment and (b) to dismiss the indictment on the ground that it \u201cfails to set forth an offense cognizable under the laws of the Commonwealth ____,,;<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The motion for particulars was allowed, and the Commonwealth responded that the defendant had \u201cforcefully and unlawfully penetrated the sexual organs of the victim, a female child, by means of his hand and/or fingers.\u201d Following the filing of that response a District Court judge, sitting in the Superior Court under statutory authority, allowed the motion to dismiss. The Commonwealth appealed. G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 28E, as amended by St. 1972, c. 740, \u00a7 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-10\">The only argument now advanced by the defendant in support of the motion is that the act charged in the Commonwealth\u2019s particulars does not constitute \u201cunnatural <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>sexual intercourse\u201d within the meaning of G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 22A. We think the argument is foreclosed by the opinion and decision of the Supreme Judicial Court in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Gallant, 373 Mass. 577 (1977), which was issued pending the appeal and following the submission of briefs in this case. In that case the court construed the words \u201cunnatural sexual intercourse\u201d found in G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 23, as appearing in St. 1974, c. 474, \u00a7 3,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> to include \u201cintrusions of a part of a person\u2019s body... into the genital... opening of another person\u2019s body.\u201d 373 Mass. at 584 (1977). It seems clear from footnote 17 of the opinion in that case, 373 Mass. at 590, that a finger is comprehended within the meaning of the words \u201ca part of a person\u2019s body\u201d as used in the quoted construction of the words \u201cunnatural sexual intercourse.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b732-5\">As the words \u201cunnatural sexual intercourse\u201d must be given the same meaning in both of G. L. c. 265, \u00a7\u00a7 22A and 23, as amended <em>(Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gonzales, ante, </em>705, 707 [1977]), the entry will be</p>\n<p id=\"b732-6\">\n<em>Order dismissing indictment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b731-11\"> This motion also contained two additional grounds, but neither of those grounds is still pressed by the defendant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b732-7\"> \u201cWhoever unlawfully has sexual intercourse or unnatural sexual intercourse, and abuses a child under sixteen years of age shall, for the first offense, be punished by imprisonment in the state prison for life or for any term of years, or, except as otherwise provided, for any term in a jail or house of correction, and for the second or subsequent offense by imprisonment in the state prison for life or for any term of years, but not less than five years.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
