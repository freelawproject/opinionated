Coffman and Bay State. Coffman had applied to the selectmen for a license to operate a flea market (more fully described hereinafter) to be located on parking lots (sometimes hereinafter referred to as the premises) leased for this purpose from Bay State which operates a racetrack and related facilities served by the parking lots. The board of selectmen refused the request on the ground that such an operation was prohibited by the Foxborough zoning bylaw as an \u201c[o]ther amusement and recreation service, outdoor\u201d forbidden in the \u201cSpecial Use District\u201d in which the premises are located. Coffman thereupon conducted a flea market on the premises, being of the view that no license was necessary and that the use did not violate the provi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>sions of the zoning by-law. The plaintiffs then brought this action alleging that the flea market, if permitted to continue, would be in violation of provisions of the special use district of the zoning by-law and provisions of the Sunday closing laws, G. L. c. 136, \u00a7\u00a7 4 and 5. The judgment was entered on a statement of agreed facts from which we draw our own inferences in determining the appropriate judgment. <em>Boston Teachers Local 66 </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Boston, </em>370 Mass. 455, 468, n.9 (1976), citing <em>Richardson </em>v. <em>Lee Realty Corp., </em>364 Mass. 632, 634 (1974). We consider whether the operation as described in the statement of agreed facts is (1) prohibited under the zoning by-law or (2) requires a license under G. L. c. 136, \u00a7 4,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> or is prohibited under G. L. c. 136, \u00a7 5.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b637-4\">1. <em>Zoning. </em>The statement of agreed facts describes the operation of the flea market as \u201cconsist [ing] of various booths at which merchandise would be offered for sale to the general public at retail. The proprietors of each of the booths were to pay to Coffman a charge for permission to operate the booth as a part of the flea market but otherwise would be free to keep whatever profits were generated from their sales during the day. Coffman was to pay a flat rental to Bay State for the Premises, would be required to provide whatever security forces and parking attendants were necessary and was <em>to </em>charge for parking in lots adjacent to the proposed flea market. There was to be no charge for ad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>mission to the flea market by patrons.\u201d Coffman proposed to conduct this operation on Sundays from 8:00 a.m. to 8:00 P.M., from April 20 through June 30. Annexed to and made a part of the statement of agreed facts is an advertisement announcing the \u201cGRAND OPENING\u201d of the \u201cFLEA MARKET.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b638-4\">The only portion of the Foxborough zoning by-law which is before us is the section entitled \u201cSpecial Use District,\u201d which contains a subsection entitled \u201cPrincipal Uses\u201d and lists various uses, some designated as \u201cPermitted uses,\u201d some as \u201cUses requiring a Special Use Permit,\u201d and some as \u201cUses specifically prohibited.\u201d There is also a second subsection entitled \u201cAccessory Uses\u201d and listing various uses similarly designated.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Among the prohibited uses is \u201c[o]ther amusement and recreation service, outdoor\u201d; and the plaintiffs argue that Coffman\u2019s operation comes within that prohibition. We see nothing in the statement of agreed facts which supports that contention. The operation as there described yields nothing which would lend plausibility to the notion that the operation somehow provides \u201crecreational shopping\u201d rather than \u201cserious shopping\u201d (see <em>Zayre Corp. </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>372 Mass. 423, 447 [1977] [Braucher, J., dissenting]) \u2014 assuming that there may be circumstances which would make such a distinction viable.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">We also reject the plaintiff\u2019s assertion (it hardly rises to the level of argument) that the flea market is an accessory use to the parking lots and racetrack and therefore forbidden by the provision in the second subsection (accessory uses) which lists as a prohibited accessory use \u201c8. Trailers or other temporary vehicles or structures for displaying goods or storing them for direct delivery to retail customers\u201d (the accessory use clause). We see no connection between the racetrack and the flea market except that they use the same premises. That this provides an insufficient <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>nexus is obvious from the myriad of eases which have dealt with attempts to use the same locus for different purposes, some of which have been permitted as accessory and some of which have been held not to be accessory and therefore prohibited. See, e.g., <em>Needham </em>v. <em>Winslow Nurseries, Inc., </em>330 Mass. 95 <em>(1953); Harvard </em>v. <em>Maxant, </em>360 Mass. 432, 438 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b639-4\">It seems to us that Coffman\u2019s operation, viewed in its totality, is a \u201cretail establishment\u201d designated in the bylaw as a permitted use and described as follows: \u201cRetail establishment selling general merchandise, including but not limited to dry goods, apparel and accessories, furniture and home furnishings, home equipment, small wares and hardware, and including discount and limited price variety stores.\u201d The word \u201cestablishment\u201d in its ordinary meaning encompasses Coffman\u2019s operation. \u201c[A]s normally used in business and in government [\u201cestablishment\u201d] means a distinct physical place of business. <em>A. H. Phillips, Inc. </em>v. <em>Walling, </em>324 U. S. 490, 496 [1945].\u201d <em>Ford Motor Co. </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Security, </em>326 Mass. 757, 762 (1951). It is not necessarily enclosed. Thus the <em>Ford Motor Co. </em>case lists \u201cshipyard\u201d as a type of establishment. See <em>Plew </em>v. <em>Horrabin &amp; Co., </em>176 Iowa 584, 589 (1916); <em>Continental Baking Co. </em>v. <em>Campbell, </em>176 Okla. 218, 219-220 (1936). Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 778 (1971) defines \u201cestablishment\u201d as \u201ca more or less fixed and usually sizeable place of business... together with all the things that are an essential part of it (as grounds, furniture, fixtures...).\u201d See Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (rev. 4th ed. 1968) (\u201cplace of business and fixtures\u201d). It thus may exclude the itinerant peddler who does not sell from a \u201cfixed site.\u201d <em>Hall-Omar Baking Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Labor &amp; Indus., </em>344 Mass. 695, 703 (1962). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ober, </em>12 Cush. 493, 495 (1853). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bergeron, </em>296 Mass. 60, 62 (1936). It does not exclude an operation such as the Coffman operation for which the same place is fixed for a number of consecutive Sundays, though the individual booths may be dismantled after each day\u2019s business. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Morrison, </em>197 Mass. 199, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>201 (1908), describing the business of operating a lunch wagon every evening as \u201cat a fixed place\u201d though the wagon was driven off every morning.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-4\">Further, a \u201cretail establishment,\u201d including as it does \u201cdiscount and limited price variety stores,\u201d connotes \u201cthe sale... in small quantities\u201d <em>(Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Moriarty, </em>311 Mass. 116, 121 [1942]) of goods displayed on the premises which the customer generally takes with him. This permitted use is not vitiated by the prohibited use in the accessory use clause. An accessory use in its ordinary signification is \u201ca use which is dependent on or pertains to the principal or main use.\u201d <em>Needham </em>v. <em>Winslow Nurseries, Inc., </em>330 Mass. at 101. This is quoted in <em>Harvard </em>v. <em>Maxant, </em>360 Mass. at 437, which also quotes (at 438-439) from <em>Lawrence </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of No. Branford, </em>158 Conn. 509, 512-513 (1969), in which the court said, \u201cIt is not enough that the use be subordinate; it must also be attendant or concomitant.\u201d See 3 Anderson, American Law of Zoning \u00a7 16.11, at 31 (1977), and 3 Williams, American Land Planning Law \u00a7 74.14, at 415 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">Moreover, the accessory use clause itself, by including \u201c[t]railers or other temporary vehicles or structures,\u201d indicates that the clause contemplates an activity separate from the primary retail business. It would be pointless if what was intended was to prohibit a discount store or supermarket from using movable display cases. Moreover, such an application of the accessory use clause would cast doubt on the validity of the expressly permitted use of a \u201c... stand for wholesale and retail sale of agricultural, horticultural or floricultural products.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b640-6\">Consistent with the principle that a by-law should be interpreted as a harmonious whole <em>(Angus </em>v. <em>Miller, ante, </em>470, 471-472 [1977]), we do not construe the accessory use clause as vitiating the permissible principal use. If the bylaw had intended to prohibit a primary retail business because it was carried on outdoors, the by-law could easily have said so. We note in this connection that the by-law elsewhere makes a distinction between indoor and outdoor activities, e.g., prohibiting \u201cother amusement and recre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>ation service, outdoor\u201d but allowing by special permit \u201cother amusement and recreation service, indoor.\u201d We see no reason in the by-law (and the plaintiffs have suggested none) which should impel us to depart from the customary analysis which treats the principal use separately from the accessory use and looks to see what is principal use and what is accessory use. See <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Building Inspector of Brockton, </em>351 Mass. 472 (1966); <em>Harvard </em>v. <em>Maxant, </em>360 Mass. 432 (1971); 1 Rathkopf, Zoning and Planning c. 23, \u00a7 3, at 23-24 (3d ed. 1974). Cf. <em>Honigfeld </em>v. <em>Byrnes, </em>14 N.J. 600, 605-606 (1954). On that analysis the Coffman operation is a principal use permitted as a retail establishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-4\">2. <em>The Sunday laws. </em>The provisions of G. L. c. 136, \u00a7 4 (see fn.l), have no application in this case because it is clear that no \u201ccharge... is made for the privilege of being present thereat____\u201d While a parking fee of $.50 per automobile was charged, there is nothing in the agreed statement to indicate that the use of those parking lots by visitors to the flea market was a requisite for admission. Nor is the fee paid for the use of a booth a charge to those \u201cengaging therein\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 4. General Laws c. 136, \u00a7 \u00a7 1,2 and 4, apply to those paying an admission fee \u201cfor the privilege\u201d of attending the various <em>\u201cSports, Games and Entertainment.. </em>.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> listed in those sections for the purpose of being \u201cpresent\u201d as a spectator or \u201cengaging\u201d as a participant in the various activities (e.g., \u201cdancing,... sport\u201d) listed in those sections. A clear distinction is made between such a participant or spectator and one who \u201csets up, establishes or maintains... or promotes\u201d the various listed sports, games and entertainment, to which G. L. c. 136, \u00a7 3,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> is applicable. The latter\u2019s payment of a fee to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>maintain a booth is immaterial to the requirement of an admission fee in \u00a7 \u00a7 1, 2 and 4. We thus need not decide the issue whether in the context of this statute the Coffman operation can be said to be a \u201cfair\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7\u00a7 1,2 and 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-4\">Nor need we discuss the relationship between the sections listed under the heading <em>\u201cSports, Games and Entertainment on Sunday,\u201d </em>G. L. c. 136, \u00a7\u00a7 2, 3 and 4, and the sections under the heading <em>\u201cBusiness, Trade, Labor or Work on Sunday\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>6</em></footnotemark><em> </em>(e.g., G. L. c. 136, \u00a7\u00a7 5 and 6). The statement of agreed facts characterizes the wares sold at the flea market as \u201cvarious articles such as paintings, antiques, hand crafted items and the like.\u201d By virtue of G. L. c. 136, \u00a7 6 (see fn.2), the sale on Sunday of such items is not prohibited by G. L. c. 136, \u00a7 5. We find nothing in the statement of agreed facts from which it can be inferred that anything but such wares was sold at the flea market. Indeed, the plaintiffs\u2019 brief states that they \u201cconcede that the articles being sold are similar to those as identified in G. L. c. 136, \u00a7 6 (29).\u201d There is thus no basis for an injunction against the sale of the merchandise sold at the flea market. See <em>Franz </em>v. <em>Franz, </em>308 Mass. 262, 264-265 (1941).</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">Accordingly, the judgment is reversed and a new judgment is to be entered dismissing the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b637-5\"> General Laws c. 136, \u00a7 4, as amended through St. 1974, c. 117, provides for the licensing by the selectmen of a town \u201cto hold on Sunday dancing or any game, sport, fair, exposition, play, entertainment or public diversion for which a charge in the form of payment or collection of money or other valuable consideration is made for the privilege of being present thereat or engaging therein____\u201d See G.
