L. c. 41, \u00a7 81U) of certain land owned ..by the defendant Backus and lying in the Wauwinet section of the town. Those routes are: (1) an appeal under G. L. C. 41,4-81BB; (2) an action of an equitable nature under G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 81Y; (3) a proceeding under G. L. c. 39, \u00a7 23C, as in effect prior to St. 1975, c. 303, \u00a7 3; and (4) an action under G. L. c. 214, \u00a7 7A. The defendants moved to dismiss under Mass.R.Civ.P. 12 (b) (1) and (6), 365 Mass. 755 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">The matter was heard and determined by a judge of the Superior Court on the complaint and the opposing affidavits submitted by the parties.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The judge ruled that \u201c[t]here is no factual dispute as to the issues raised by the motions\u201d and ordered the entry of a judgment dismissing the action in all its aspects. The plaintiffs appealed from that order. The appeal must be dismissed because no \u201cfinal judgment\u201d (G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 113, as appearing in St. 1973, c. 1114, \u00a7 202) has yet been entered. See Mass.R.A.P. 3 (a), 365 Mass. 845. (1974), which is cast in terms of \u201c[a]n appeal <em>permitted by law\u201d </em>(emphasis supplied). However, as the order for judgment is in such form that a judgment of dismissal may now be entered by the clerk without further action on the part of the judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>(see Mass.R.Civ.P. 58 [a] [1], 365 Mass. 826 [1974]), we proceed to consider by way of dictum <em>(Giacobbe </em>v. <em>First Coolidge Corp. </em>367 Mass. 309, 314 [1975]) certain of the contentions argued by the parties.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b230-4\">We find at least one insurmountable obstacle along each of the routes selected by the various plaintiffs (or groups of plaintiffs) in their efforts to overturn the decision of the planning board and prevent the consummation of the proposed development.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">1. We consider first whether there has been compliance with the requirements of the first sentence of G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 81BB (as appearing in St. 1953, c. 674, \u00a7 7), which reads in pertinent part as follows: \u201cAny person, whether or not a party to the proceedings, aggrieved... by any decision of a planning board concerning a plan of a subdivision... may appeal to the superior court... for the county in which the land concerned is situated; provided, that such appeal is entered within twenty days after such decision has been recorded in the office of the city or town clerk... and notice of such appeal is given to such city or town clerk so as to be received within such twenty days.\u201d It is settled that compliance with the notice requirement within the twenty-day period is a jurisdictional prerequisite to the prosecution of an appeal under \u00a7 81BB. <em>Carey </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of Revere, </em>335 Mass. 740, 745 (1957), <em>S.C. </em>335 Mass. 746 (1957). <em>Cohen </em>v. <em>Board of Registration in Pharmacy, </em>347 Mass. 96, 98 (1964). Compare <em>Pierce </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Carver, </em>369 Mass. 804, 809 (1976); <em>Marvin </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Medfield, </em>post, 772 (1977).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">The Subdivision Control Law is a \u201ccomprehensive statutory scheme.\u201d <em>Costanza &amp; Bertolino, Inc. </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of No. Reading, </em>360 Mass. 677, 679 (1971). <em>Cassani </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of Hull, </em>1 Mass. App. Ct. 451, 458 (1973). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>\u201cThe intention of relevant sections of the Subdivision Control Law is to set up an orderly procedure for definitive action within stated times, and for <em>notice </em>of that action in <em>offices of record </em>within stated times, so that all concerned may rely upon <em>recorded </em>action or the absence thereof within such times. See G. L. c. 41, \u00a7\u00a7 81V, 81W, 81X, <em>81BB, </em>81EE\u201d (emphasis supplied). <em>Selectmen of Pembroke </em>v. <em>R. &amp; P.

App. Ct. at 457. \u201cThe provision for notice to the clerk is... designed to give to third persons who may be concerned with theTand at least constructive notice of the appeal, which, if sustained, may invalidate an outstanding, apparently valid plan.\u201d <em>Carey </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of Revere, </em>335 Mass. at 745. Compare <em>McLaughlin </em>v. <em>Rockland Zoning Bd. of Appeals, </em>351 Mass. 678, 680 (1967); <em>Garfield </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Rockport, </em>356 Mass. 37, 39 (1969); <em>Carr </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Saugus, </em>361 Mass. 361, 362 (1972); <em>Pierce </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Carver, </em>369 Mass. at 808; <em>Costello </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Lexington, </em>3 Mass. App. Ct. 441, 443 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b231-4\">With these principles in mind we proceed to summarize the facts which appear in or which can properly be inferred from the allegations of the complaint and the opposing affidavits. The decision of the planning board in this case was filed in the office of the town clerk on September 3, 1975. On September 17,1975, the president of the plaintiff Nantucket Land Council, Inc.,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> entered the office of the town clerk with the original of the complaint in this matter and requested the clerk, acting as a notary public, to take his (the president\u2019s) oath to the truth of the allegations of the complaint. The clerk did so, affixing his signature and notarial seal on the last page of the complaint. The clerk has sworn (without contradiction) that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>he \u201ctook no notice of the content of the document and recall [s] seeing no portion of the complaint other than the signature page,\u201d which contains prayers for preliminary injunctive relief against the defendant Backus and a prayer that \u201cthe decision of the [pjlanning [b] oard... be annulled.\u201d It does not appear, nor is it asserted in any of the affidavits submitted in behalf of the plaintiffs, that the clerk actually read any part of the complaint, although it is arguable that he had an opportunity to read the complaint in its entirety. The complaint was then taken from the clerk and was thereafter timely entered in the Superior Court on the same day, September 17.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\">An article on the front page of the September 18 edition of the weekly newspaper published in the town announced the entry of the appeal and its objective, identified the parties, and contained a reference to the locus covered by the subdivision plan which had been approved by the planning board on September 2. The town clerk was a subscriber to the newspaper, both at the town office and at his home,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and copies were mailed to him at both addresses on September 18. The record is silent as to whether the clerk ever read the newspaper. There is no dispute that none of the plaintiffs gave the clerk any written or other form of notice of the appeal until some time after September 23,1975. If the clerk did learn of the appeal before that date, he made no record of that fact in his office. If the clerk ever did receive a copy of the complaint,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> it was not until after September 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">There is no obligation on the part of a town clerk to make any investigation as to whether an appeal has been filed in court (see and compare <em>Carey </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of Revere, </em>335 Mass. at 747) or to make a record of any fact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>he may learn from a newspaper he is not required to read. There is no room for doubt that it is the plaintiff, who has the burden of entering the appeal in court, who must give the clerk the notice which is required by \u00a7 81BB. The plaintiff must do more than give the notice; the clerk must actually receive the notice within the twenty-day period after the \u201cdecision [of the planning board] has been recorded in... [his] office.\u201d The teaching of the portion of the <em>Pembroke </em>case which has already been quoted (348 Mass. at 125) is that the notice is something which is also to be recorded, which must necessarily be so if the notice is to serve its intended purpose of providing constructive notice of the appeal to third persons who may be concerned with the land. See the <em>Carey </em>case, 335 Mass. at 745.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-4\">It would seem that only a written notice to the clerk which he records upon its receipt would (a) serve the purpose last mentioned and (b) provide the Superior Court with a simple means of determining its jurisdiction to hear the appeal without the necessity of holding a preliminary hearing such as that which was required in the present case. We need not decide that point in order to dispose of this aspect of the present case. It is enough that nothing found in any of the affidavits submitted in behalf of the plaintiffs was sufficient to raise a dispute as to the fact that none of the plaintiffs gave the town clerk any notice of the appeal within the twenty-day period following the date of the recording of the planning board\u2019s decision in the clerk\u2019s office. <em>Boston Police Patrolmen's Assoc. Inc. </em>v. <em>Police Commr. of Boston, </em>4 Mass. App. Ct. 673, 675 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">2. The plaintiffs, who include among their number ten taxpayers of the town of Nantucket, also seek to overturn the decision of the planning board by proceeding under the last paragraph of G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 81Y, as appearing in St. 1953, c. 674, \u00a7 7.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The complaint in this matter does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>allege a violation (or even a contemplated violation) of any provision found in any of the four preceding paragraphs of \u00a7 81Y, and we note at the outset that there is a question whether the Legislature intended that the remedy afforded to \u201cten taxable inhabitants\u201d should apply to both of what might be regarded as two separate and distinct branches of jurisdiction granted to the Superior Court. See note 9, <em>supra. </em>However that question should be resolved, it is clear that no case decided under or with reference to \u00a7 81Y has held that its provisions may be invoked to overturn a decision by which a planning board has acted under G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 81U, to approve a definitive plan of subdivision, either with or without conditions. See <em>Carey </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of Revere, </em>335 Mass. at 742-743; <em>Bloom </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of Brookline, </em>346 Mass. 278, 283 (1963); <em>Cassani </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of Hull, </em>1 Mass. App. Ct. at 458.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-4\">There are good reasons why this is so. General Laws c. 41, \u00a7 81BB, is explicit on the point that the \u201cexclusive\u201d remedy with respect to \u201cany decision of a planning board concerning a plan of a subdivision\u201d \u201cshall be\u201d as provided in that section. See <em>Rounds </em>v. <em>Water &amp; Sewer Commrs. of Wilmington, </em>347 Mass. 40, 45 (1964); <em>Marino </em>v. <em>Board of Appeal of Beverly, </em>2 Mass. App. Ct. 859, 860 (1974). Compare <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Plymouth, </em>340 Mass. 230, 232 (1960); <em>Saab </em>v. <em>Building Inspector of Lowell, </em>1 Mass. App. Ct. 87, 88 (1973); <em>Costello </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Lexington, </em>3 Mass. App. Ct. at 445. We have already seen (part 1, <em>supra) </em>that one of the purposes of the \u00a7 81BB requirement of notice of an appeal to the town <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>clerk within twenty days of the recording of the decision of the planning board with the clerk is to advise third persons whether they may deal safely with land which is covered by an approved plan of subdivision. We now note, that the entire scheme for the recording or registration of approved subdivision plans (G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 8IX) \u201cand for the issuance of building permits with respect to lots in approved subdivisions (\u00a7 81Y, second par.) woutcTBe set at naught if ten taxnavers.were to be given a year (\u00a7 81Y, last sentence; n.9, <em>supra) </em>in which to launch an attack_on a planning board\u2019s approval of a subdivision plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-4\">The judge was entirely correct in ordering this aspect of the case dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">3. The plaintiffs (who include at least three registered voters of the Commonwealth) have alleged that the vote of the planning board to approve the subdivision plan was taken on September 2, 1975, in secret at an executive session held contrary to the provisions of G. L. c. 39, \u00a7 23A, as then in effect. They argue that they should have been permitted to proceed under the first sentence of G. L. c. 39, \u00a7 23C, as amended by St. 1974, c. 83 (\u201cAn Act extending the remedy in case of non-compliance with the law requiring certain meetings to be open to the public\u201d), to secure an order invalidating the vote of the planning board.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> It was not until the effective date of the 1974 statute that the Superior Court was granted jurisdiction, in the exercise of its discretion, to \u201cinvalidate any action taken at any meeting which violates the provisions of\u201d c. 39 of the General Laws. See <em>Elmer </em>v. <em>Board of Zoning Adjustment of Boston, </em>343 Mass. 24, 25-27 (1961); <em>Dion </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Waltham, </em>344 Mass. 547, 552-553 (1962); <em>Reilly </em>v. <em>Selectmen of Framingham, </em>345 Mass. 363, 366 (1963). That jurisdiction was granted on the express proviso \u201cthat [the necessary] petition... [be] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>filed within fourteen days of the date when <em>said action is taken\u201d </em>(emphasis supplied). As we read the 1974 statute, the fourteen-day period ran from the date of the forbidden \u201caction,\u201d and not from the date when such action was (a) made public, (b) discovered by the plaintiff, or (c) intended to take effect. On this record the \u201caction\u201d complained of was the vote taken by the planning board on September 2, 1975. The date of that vote was disclosed on the face of the decision of the planning board which was filed in the town clerk\u2019s office on September 3, 1975. The complaint was not filed in court until September 17, 1975.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-4\">The plaintiffs point to the amendments of the Open Meeting Law which were effected by St. 1975, c. 303, \u00a7 3, which did not take effect until January 1, 1976 (St. 1975, c. 303, \u00a7 5), a date some two weeks after the entry of the order for dismissal of the present action. The twelfth paragraph of the new G. L. c. 39, \u00a7 23B (as appearing in St. 1975, c. 303, \u00a7 3) has the fourteen-day period running from \u201cthe date when such action is made public.\u201d The 1975 statute (\u201cAn Act further regulating meetings of governmental bodies\u201d) is grounded on a concept quite different from that of the 1974 statute, and we do not think this is an instance in which it can properly be said that a later statute was intended to clarify an ambiguity found in an earlier statute. Compare <em>Brooks </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Gloucester, ante, </em>158, 160-161 (1977). Contrast <em>Selectmen of Pembroke </em>v. <em>R. &amp; P. Realty Corp. </em>348 Mass. at 124-125, 127.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">We conclude that the order for judgment was also correct with respect to this aspect of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">4. We consider only one point in connection with the effort by ten domiciliaries of the Commonwealth to proceed under the third paragraph of G. L. c. 214, \u00a7 7A, as appearing in St. 1973, c. 1114, \u00a7 62.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> It is settled that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>\u201c[i]n order to invoke the jurisdiction of the Superior Court under [what is now \u00a7 7A] there must be an allegation that \u2018damage to the environment is occurring or is about to occur.\u2019 \u201d <em>Boston </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Port Authy. </em>364 Mass. 639, 645 (1974). We find no such allegation in the present complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-4\">The nearest approach to such an.allegation is an assertion that at the hearing before the planmng~Eoard it \u201creceived a letter from the Nantucket Conservation Commission, dated August 18, 1975, indicating that the... [defendant Backus] had caused a substantial gash to be excavated in the sand dunes comprising the subdivision, and that... [she] had caused such work to be done in violation of the wetlands protection act, G. L. c. 131, \u00a7 40, the subdivision control law, G. L. c. 41, \u00a7\u00a7 81K-81GG,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and that the violation had continued unabated up to the time of said hearing.\u201d The quoted assertion cannot be taken as an affirmative allegation that the defendant Backus had in fact caused a substantial gash to be excavated in the dunes, or that any excavation continued to exist at the time of the filing of the complaint. <em>Waldor Realty Corp. </em>v. <em>Town Clerk of Bellingham, </em>350 Mass. 669, 670, 671 (1966). One of the conditions of the planning board\u2019s approval of the subdivision plan was that \u201call <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>public improvements shown on the plan and made a part of the covenant with the [b]oard be approved by the Conservation Commission in accordance with the State Wetlands Protection Act (chapter 131 of the General Laws, Section 40, as amended) .\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> There is no allegation that the defendant Backus intends to violate that condition.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b238-4\">We do not think the judge is now to be faulted for concluding that the complaint fails to allege that damage to the environment \u201cis occurring or is about to occur\u201d within the meaning of G. L. c. 214, \u00a7 7A. Any amendment of the complaint in order to set out facts from which the Superior Court might be able to determine the existence of jurisdiction under \u00a7 <em>7A </em>is within the discretion of that court.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> See <em>Charbonnier </em>v. <em>Amico, </em>367 Mass. 146, 153-154 <em>(1975); Caine </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>368 Mass. 815, 816 (1975); <em>Balsavich </em>v. <em>Local 170, International Brotherhood of Teamsters, </em>371 Mass. 283, 287-288 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">\n<em>Appeal dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b229-6\"> It does not appear from anything found in the record, or even from anything found in either of the plaintiffs\u2019 briefs, that anyone objected to the procedure by which the case was decided below.

It' appears to have escaped the attention of all the parties that that section was repealed effective five days after the filing of the complaint (see St. 1975, c. 615), possibly because of redundancy with the provisions of the State Sanitary Code.
