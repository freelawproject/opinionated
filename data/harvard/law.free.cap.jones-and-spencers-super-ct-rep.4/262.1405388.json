On the trial evidence was admitted against plaintiff\u2019s, objection and exception, which tended to show that the</p>\n<p id=\"b271-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>water which caused the injury did not come from the ditch, but from the sewer or the connection with the sewer, and that the injury was the result of a defective sewerage system in that vicinity. We think the evi- .&lt; dence was properly received. Although, under the requirements of section 149 of the Code, new matter must be pleaded, and consequently the defences of payment, release, accord and satisfaction, of arbitrament, and many other entire and partial defences, which, while they do not deny the cause of action stated in the complaint, yet seek to avoid or to bar it, and which were formerly available under the general issue, must now be set up in the answer before evidence in support thereof can be received (McKyring <em>v. </em>Bull, 16 <em>N. Y. 297), </em>yet, under a general or specific denial of any part of tire complaint which the plaintiff is required to prove to maintain his action, the defendant, upon principle and authority, is at all times at liberty to prove anything tending to show that plaintiff\u2019s allegation is untrue (Wheeler <em>v. </em>Billings, 38 <em>N. Y. </em>263 ; Greenfield <em>v. </em>Mass. Mutual Life Ins. Co. 47 <em>N. Y. </em>430).</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">The testimony of the parties was conflicting, and therefore presented a proper case for the jury. Plaintiff conceded that by refraining from moving for the direction of a verdict subject to an assessment of damages (Rowe <em>v. </em>Stevens, 12 <em>Abb. N. S. </em>389; S. C., 44 <em>How. </em>10).</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">The case having been submitted to the jury, under a charge to which no valid objection lies, and plaintiff\u2019s exception to the refusal of the court to charge otherwise as requested, and to the rulings of the court upon the questions of evidence that arose during the trial, appearing to be clearly untenable, the judgment and order appealed from must be severally affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-7\">Curtis and Van Vorst, J.J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
