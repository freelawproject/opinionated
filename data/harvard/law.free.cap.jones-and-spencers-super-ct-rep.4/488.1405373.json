Under the general expression of power contained in the statutes, courts have lield a by-law forbidding transfer under indebtedness to the corporation was authorized, and therefore valid (McDowell <em>v. </em>Bank of Wilmington, 1 <em>Harr. </em>27, 31; Cunningham <em>v. </em>Alabama L. Ins. Co., 4 <em>Ala. (N. S.) 652, 666, 658, 659; </em>St. Louis Per. Ins.

The by-law is reasonable, and is not \u201c inconsistent with any existing law,\u201d and as a protection to the corporation and its property and credit, it is salutary, and for the security and advantage of stockholders. \u201cThe \u201cpublic has a concern in the Solvency and security of \u201cthese institutions, and the means should be allowed \u201cto indemnify themselves against losses.\u201d \u201cThe re- \u201c straint imposed is like giving a right of set-off against \u201cthose who maybe indebted to it. If an individual \u201cholds the money of another, the person entitled to it 5 c cannot make any transfer or assignment of the money \u201cto another which will deprive the depositary of his \u201cright of set-off against debts due before notice of the \u201cassignment. The dividends on stock accruing after \u201can assignment and before notice thereof maybe regained by a corporation against the assignee, to be <em>u </em>applied in payment of a debt actually due from the \u201c assignor at the time of notice of the assignment \u201d (Bates v. N. Y. Ins. Co., 3 <em>Johns. Cas., </em>238; Per Scott, J., St. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>Louis Ins.

This by-law being valid, it gave the corporation a right to detain the stock until the indebtedness was paid; it did- not forfeit the stock, but created a restraint upon the full disposition and complete change of ownership (An<em>gell and Ames on Corp. </em>[9th ed. 356]).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b501-5\">It is, in effect, a lien, whether it be strictly so or not.

Smalley (2 <em>Cow. </em>770).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b501-6\">Whatever it may be called, there is under this by-law an equity given to the corporation as security for the indebtedness. That equity is enforced by a refusal to transfer the stock, and the court will not require a transfer to be made until the indebtedness is discharged (Union Bank v. Land, 2 <em>Wheat. </em>360, 393 Brent v. Bank of Washington, 10 <em>Peters, </em>596, 614; Reise v. Bank of Commerce, 14 <em>Maryland, </em>277; McCready y. Rumsey, 6 <em>Duer. 574; </em>Leggett v.

Heron, Administratrix (52 <em>Penn. </em>280), is not in conflict with the above; in that case there was no by-law p\u2019assed imposing the restriction until after the assignment, per Thompson, J. (p. 282).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b501-8\">This lien, or claim of the corporation, is not waived or impaired by the form of the certificate declaring that the stockholder is entitled to so many shares, trans<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>ferable only on the books of the company, personally or by attorney, on surrender of the certificate (Reese v.

The capital stock of an incorporated company is personal property, and it has not, neither has the certificate or other evidence of title or ownership, any of the qualiti\u00e9s of commercial or negotiable paper (Weaver v. Barden, 49 <em>N. Y. </em>286, 288 ; McNeil v. Tenth National Bank, 46 <em>Ibid. </em>332; N. Y. &amp; N. H. Railroad Co. v. Schuyler, 34 <em>Ibid. </em>80, per Davis, J. ; Mechanics\u2019 Bank v. N.

The delivery of the certificate with assignment and power endorsed to the plaintiff vested in him the entire title, legal and equitable, which was held by Bradley at the time of the assignment, subject to such liens or claims as the company had upon it <em>(Angell and, Ames on Corp. </em>[9th ed.] \u00a7 354; Child v.

Rumsey, 6 <em>Duer, </em>574).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b502-6\">YI. The plaintiff, as assignee of the stock, is chargeable with notice of the restrictions that may exist to his acquiring the complete title (Per Allen, J., Bank of Attica v. Mfrs. Bank, 20 <em>N. Y. </em>517; McCready v. Rumsey, 6 <em>Duer. </em>577, per Hoffman, J).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b502-7\">Where a person has information sufficient to put him upon inquiry, he is presumed to have made the inquiry or to have been guilty of a degree of negligence fatal to his claim to be considered a <em>bona fide </em>purchaser (Williamson v.

It does not create any rule peculiar to those corporations, or give a more limited title to the assignee of a certificate of shares in a banking corporation than such an assignee would have of any other corporation. Ho transferee of any stock obtains, as against the corporation, any better title than his assignor, and is subject to all the liabilities of the-assignor, so far \u2019as regards the stock (McCready <em>v. </em>Rumsey, 6 <em>Duer, </em>582, Bosworth, J.).</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b503-7\"><em>Flanegan &amp; Bright, </em>attorneys, and <em>Osborne E.

Bradley was the legal owner of the stock, and had the right to transfer it to Bartlett (Bank of Utica <em>v. </em>Smalley, 2 <em>Cow. 770; </em>Com. Bank of Buffalo <em>v. </em>Kortright, 22 <em>Wend. </em>348 ; Fatman <em>v. </em>Lobach, 1 <em>Duer, </em>354).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b503-9\">II. The plaintiff, through the pledge and the judgment, became the legal and equitable owner of the stock.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b503-10\">He had no notice of any lien of the company upon it. The restriction upon the right of transfer being contained in a by-law, he could be affected only by actual notice (Morgan <em>v. </em>Bank of North America, 8 <em>Serg. &amp; R. </em>172).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b503-11\">It is also to be remembered that the certificate, in its common use in the market, approximates as nearly as possible to negotiability.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b504-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>III. Assuming that the by-law created a lien upon the stock, still the company have lost the right to assert it against this plaintiff. Such by-laws must have only reasonable scope <em>(Angell &amp; A. on Cor. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 354, 355, 567; Robinson <em>v. </em>Chartered Bank, <em>Law Rep., </em>1 <em>Eq. </em>32).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b504-4\">1. The company has impaired its right to the enforcement of the by-laws:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b504-5\"><em>(a). </em>By leaving the certificate in the hands of Bradley, thus conferring upon him an apparent title (McNeil <em>v. </em>Tenth Nat. Bank, 46 N. <em>Y. </em>325).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b504-6\">IV. The by-law does not by its terms create a lien. It merely provides that if Bradley is indebted to the company, Ms stock shall not be transferred without the consent of the treasurer. Its utmost effect would be to give the company fair opportunity to protect its claim by attachment or by equitable proceedings.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b504-7\">V. The by-law could not create a lien, because statutory authority is wholly wanting (Steamship Dock Co. <em>v. </em>Heron\u2019s Admx., 52 <em>Penn. State R., </em>280; Gribson <em>v. </em>Hudson Bay Co., 1 <em>Str. </em>645; Stebbins <em>v. </em>Phoenix Ins. Co., 3 <em>Paige, </em>350; McCready v.

They authorize, for example, such a regulation as that which governs the certificate in this case, viz., that the transfer shall be on the \u2022 surrender of the certificate.

The only restriction upon the right to sell and transfer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>stock is expressly stated in section 8, viz. : \u201cNo shares shall be transferable until all previous calls thereon shall have been fully paid in, or shall have been declared forfeited-for the non-payment of calls thereon.\u201d</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b505-4\">By the Court.\u2014Barbour, C.J.</author>\n<p id=\"Av7\">The only power expressly given to companies organized under the general Manufacturing Corporations Act touching the transfer of their stock, is found in the seventh and eighth sections of that act, and in the first section of title 3, chapter 18 of the Revised Statutes, which are as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">\u00a7 7. The trustees of such company shall have power to make such prudential by-laws as they shall deem proper for the <em>management </em>and <em>disposition of the stock </em>.and business affairs of the company, not inconsistent with the laws of this State, etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">\u00a7 8. The stock of such company shall be deemed personal estate, and shall be transferred <em>in such manner </em>as shall be prescribed by the by-laws of the company (L<em>aws of </em>1848, page 56.)</p>\n<p id=\"b505-7\">By \u00a7 1 of title 3d, every corporation, as such, is given power \u201cTo make by-laws not inconsistent with any existing law, for the management of its property, the regulation of its affairs, <em>and for the transfer of its stock\u2019\u2019 \u2019 </em>(subdiv. 6, 2 <em>R. S. [5th ed., </em>596]).</p>\n<p id=\"b505-8\">The seventh section was designed, no doubt, to authorize each company to regulate and fix, through bylaws, the manner in which the stock that would constitute its capital when sold or subscribed and paid for, \u25a0should be distributed and disposed of upon its organization, and also, probably, to provide by fixed rules for the manner in which stock subsequently acquired by the company as owner should be sold or held. It is quite clear that the legislature could not have intended Tby that section to empower the company to control or prohibit the sale or disposition of stock not belonging io\"itself, but owned as \u201cpersonal estate\u201d bv others.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>The stock of a corporation, like the corporation itself, is an artificial, invisible, intangible thing, and is, therefore, incapable of actual delivery. In practice, however, certificates are issued by the company stating that certain persons are, respectively, stockholders or owners of a certain number of shares, and that the same are transferable on the books of the company by the owner in person, or by his attorney, on the surrender of the certificate, and to that is usually annexed a blank power of attorney ; and the delivery of such certificate and power, properly executed, to the purchaser upon a sale of the stock, is considered, and in law is, a good and valid symbolic delivery of the stock itself. Upon a sale of the stock and the delivery of the certificate and power, therefore, the purchaser becomes the absolute owner of the stock described in it; or rather, of all the vendor\u2019s property and interest in such stock, wholly independent of any act of ratification or dissent on the part of the company (See McNiel v. The Tenth National Bank, 46 <em>N. Y. </em>331, and cases there cited). But it seems to have been assumed by legislators from the earliest times that corporations should have the power or means of ascertaining by certain evidenc\u00e9 to be placed and perpetuated upon their own books what persons were in fact stockholders, and the number of' shares owned by each, so that their respective rights as voters and sharers of dividends could be determined, and the company thereby saved from vexatious litigation touching those matters ; and it was for that purpose, probably, that the provisions authorizing the company to prescribe by a by-law the manner in which stock should be transferred, was inserted in the eighth section of the Act of 1848, and in the Revised Statutes above referred to.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-4\">The defendants claim, however, that those provisions-, also empowered the company to enact the by-law which declares that11 no stock shall be allowed to be trans<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>ferred on the \"books of the company if the person in whose name the stock shall stand shall \"be indebted to the com]Dany, unless with the consent of. the president and treasurer, or by a vote of the board of trustees,\u201d and that such by-law is binding upon the plaintiff. For the following brief reasons, I am satisfied that this claim of the defendants cannot properly be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-4\"><em>First. </em>The Act of 1848 expressly declares that the stock \u201c shall be deemed personal estate, and <em>shall be </em>transferable,\u201d with one single exception, which is made in the act itself in these words : \u201c but no shares shall be transferable until all previous calls thereon shall have been fully paid in, or shall have been declared forfeited for the non-payment of calls thereon.\u201d Upon the principle of the maxim <em>exjpressio unius est exelusio alterius, </em>it must be held that the legislature could not have intended to empower a company to make another and further exception by means of a by-law. The entire question as to the right of the owner to transfer his stock, together with the exceptions to that right, was before the minds of the legislators, and it must be assumed they provided for all the exceptions'they intended to make. Besides, nothing short of a direct and positive authority given by the act, in clear and explicit terms, would be sufficient to empower a company to prohibit the transfer of stock which the legislature, in the same act, had declared to be personal estate, and, with one exception, transferable. Such authority cannot be implied from the general power given to the corporation to make by-laws for the transfer of its stock, or to prescribe the manner in which it shall be transferred.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\"><em>Second. </em>It is only the manner, form, or mode in which the transfer must be made that is the subject of regulation by the company through its by-laws ; and the mode of manner of transferring thereby provided for must be a reasonable one, and not such a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>method as will prevent an owner from transferring his stock or seriously embarrass him in so doing, nor such a one as will deprive him of any substantial right whatever. <em>A </em>by-law, therefore, which, at the will of all or of any of the officers or directors of the corporation, prohibits a transfer of his stock by an owner because he is in debt to such company is not only unreasonable, but wholly <em>ultra vires </em>and void. The law does not confer upon corporations the power of thus coercing payments under pretence of a by-law prescribing the manner in which stock shall be transferred upon its books.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-4\"><em>Third. </em>Sufficient evidence was presented upon the trial to show that the plaintiff purchased the stock in good faith, relying upon the certificate, which stated in effect that Bradley was the owner of the two hundred shares, and that the same were transferable upon the books of the company to the person entitled thereto upon the surrender of the certificate, and which contained no condition other than such surrender. The defendants, therefore, were estopped by their certificate from subsequently claiming that the stock was not transferable to a purchaser upon complying with the sole condition expressed therein. A contrary doctrine would open the door to the perpetration of great frauds.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">The by-law relied upon by the defendants furnished no justification for their refusal to permit a transfer of the stock to be made upon the books of the corporation; and it follows that the judgment appealed from was correct, and should be affirmed, with costs.,</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
