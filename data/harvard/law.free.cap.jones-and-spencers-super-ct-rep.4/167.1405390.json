The plea of <em>imprisonment is a defence strictly personal to the principal debtor </em>(Chapman <em>v. </em>Hatt, 11 <em>Wend. </em>41; Sunderland v. Loder, 5 <em>Wend. 58 ; </em>Cooper v. Bigelow, 1 <em>Cowen, 56; </em>Wakeman <em>v. </em>Lyon and Evans, 9 <em>Wend. </em>241).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b176-11\">The cases in which the plea has been held to be good have been cases where,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b176-12\">(1.)

The court held that the taking of the body of the debtor in execution was a satisfaction of the debt for the payment of which the bond was given, so long as the imprisonment continued, and therefore that the action against the sureties of the debtor upon a collateral obligation could not be maintained (see also Wakeman <em>v. </em>Lyon, 9 <em>Wend. 241).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b177-8\">The judgment should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-9\">Freedman and Sedgwick, JJ., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
