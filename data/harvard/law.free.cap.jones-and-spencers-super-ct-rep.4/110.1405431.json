To which said person replied that neither he nor the company could tell whether they had any moneys in their hands belonging to the attachment debtor or not, as the case had not been adjusted\u2014as the matter had not been adjusted. Italso appeared in the evidence that the chairman of a committee appointed by four insurance companies (with one of which the person on whom the attachment and notices were served was connected), in which the attachment debtor had insurances to settle and adjust a loss claimed to be covered by the insurance, wrote to the attachment debtor informing him that an attachment had been levied on the companies.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b121-11\">On the trial it appeared that the action was commenced prior to February 27th, 1869.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b121-12\">The policy of insurance read in evidence contained a clause providing that the amount of loss or damage of or to the insured property should be payable sixty days after due notice of such loss or damage, and proofs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>thereof shall have been made by the insured and received at the company\u2019s office in accordance with the conditions annexed to the policy, and the terms and provisions of the policy, unless the property be replaced, or the company shall have given notice of their intention to rebuild or repair the damaged premises.

S. Candler, Jr., which were then served upon and left with you, in fact referred to, and were intended to specify the debt and property of E. S. Candler, Jr., hereinafter described, and the said notices are hereby amended, and made more specific by adding to each of them the following allegations:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b123-4\">\u201cThat said warrants of attachment were levied and are hereby levied on certain money, to wit, a debt of $2,437.50, then and still owing from you to said E.

That the attachments had never been levied upon the property in question.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b124-6\">2. That in the twelfth condition of insurance it was-expressly agreed that no suits or actions against the company, for the recovery of any claim by virtue of the policy, should be sustainable .in any court of law or chancery, unless said suit should be commenced within six months after the loss occurred.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b124-7\">3. That no right of action ever accrued to anybody, inasmuch as 'the proofs of loss were never served in compliance with the ninth condition of the policy.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b124-8\">The justice dismissed the complaint on the ground that the sheriff\u2019s proceedings did not constitute a levy, and that the unadjusted claim of Candler against the company had not been attached, the notice served not. sufficiently \u201c <em>showing the property levied </em>on\u201d <em>(Code,. </em>\u00a7 235).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b124-9\">Plaintiff\u2019s exceptions were ordered to be heard in the first instance at the General Term, with a stay in the action until decision thereon.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b124-10\"><em>William, H. Badger and Livingston K. </em>Miller, of counsel for plaintiff, urged :</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b124-11\">1. Defects in the notice, if any, are immaterial in this case, as proof is undisputed that it fully accomplished its object.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b124-12\">\n<em>Ratio legis eessat, lex ipse cessat.</em>\n</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b124-13\">The admission in the answer, the statement of Tompkins to Sweeney, and the act of defendants\u2019 committee in writing to Candler, that attachments had been levied, show conclusively that the object of the notice was fully accomplished (Tate <em>v. </em>Jordan, 3 <em>Abb. pr.. </em>394).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b125-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>2. The defects, if any, are amendable, and there is no just reason why the new levy offered in evidence, \u25a0or the amended notice offered should not have been admitted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b125-4\">It is common practice now, and ought to be, to plead or prove, in furtherance of justice, any facts occurring after suit brought, and even after judgment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b125-5\">There is no limit of time within which a sheriff must levy an attachment. His powers continue even after his term of office expires, and as long as he holds the process (2 <em>R. S. </em>439, \u00a7 89, 91; Millbank v. Broadway Bank, 3 <em>Abb., N. S. </em>223 ; Rinchey <em>v. </em>Stryker, 26 <em>How. Pr., </em>83 ; McKay <em>v. </em>Harrower, 27 <em>Barb., </em>463 ; Abbott <em>v. </em>Metropolitan Fire Ins. Co. ; Same <em>v. </em>The Star Ins. Co.; Same <em>v. </em>The Globe Ins. Co. ; <em>Civil Law Journal for February, </em>1873, p. 51).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b125-6\">In these cases the General Term in Brooklyn, by Justices Barnard, Hogeboom, and Tappen, approved an amendment allowed by Pratt, J., which alleged a reassignment of the policy to plaintiff subsequent to the commencement of the actions for its collection, it appearing that plaintiff had assigned the policy before suit, so that at its commencement he had no cause of action whatever. This was after judgment absolute had been ordered for defendants on demurrer to the complaint in one of the cases. The court also allowed .a farther affidavit to be filed <em>nunc pro tunc, </em>after argument at the General Term of an appeal from Judge Pratt\u2019s order, which showed an additional reason for allowing the amendment to be that any new action was barred by a limitation clause of one year in the policies. That is precisely our case here, only the limitation is six months.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b125-7\">3. The notice was sufficient as it was fully understood and accepted, and an action evidently had to be brought to adjust the loss. The sheriff was therefore right in bringing it at once, before the six months\u2019 limitation. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>clause in the policy, then nearly run out, should \"bar \"both him and Candler, whose rights he was assuming to represent.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b126-4\">In Kelly <em>v. </em>Roberts <em>(40 N. Y. </em>432), the second notice served, merely adding the amount as \u201ca sum of $1,200,\u201d was no more specific than this, and was held sufficient (p. 442). The amount in that case was also liquidated, so that it could be specified. (Opinion of Judges Daniels and James in Clarke <em>v. </em>Goodrich, 44 <em>How. Pr. </em>234; Greenleaf v. Mumford, 19 <em>Abb. </em>478 Drake <em>v. </em>Goodridge, 54 <em>Barb. </em>78, overruled on other grounds only; and cases cited under point seven).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b126-5\">4. The cases cited by defendants as authority do not touch the question as now presented.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b126-6\">Clark <em>v. </em>Goodridge (41 <em>N. Y., </em>210) has been very imperfectly reported, and has been, in consequence, strangely misunderstood and misapplied.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b126-7\">A corrected report of it will be found in 44 <em>How. </em>Pr., 226, with opinions of four judges not before published, which show that nothing whatever was decided by the court as to the sufficiency of the notice.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b126-8\">There is merely a <em>dictum </em>of Ward Hunt, J., against the notice, and an opinion by Judges Daniels and James in its favor, while Judges Lott and Grover hold that question not to be before the court at all, in which they are plainly correct.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b126-9\">The only thing actually decided was that the sheriffs return was conclusive, and terminated his powers in the matter. There was no process whatever in the sheriff\u2019s hands at the time the receiver acquired title, the attachment and execution into which it had merged having both been previously returned (41 <em>N. Y., </em>p. 211; 44 <em>How. </em>Pr., 226).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b126-10\">The other cases cited by defendants are equally foreign from the point.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b126-11\">In Orser <em>v. </em>Grossman (11 <em>How. Pr. </em>520) no attachment (p. 522) at all was served on defendants. It was. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>left with a man in defendants\u2019 store, with no evidence that it ever came to defendants\u2019 knowledge. This defective service disposed of the case, and no decision whatever was made as to the sufficiency of the notice, though it was alluded to by the court as doubt.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b127-4\">Kuhlman <em>v. </em>Orser (5 <em>Duer, </em>249) was a suit against the sheriff for conversion, in which the question decided was that the defendant in the attachment suit had never owned the goods in question. The notice served does not appear, and nothing was decided as to its sufficiency.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"72\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b127-5\">Wilson <em>v. </em>Duncan (8 <em>Abb. </em>354, 11 <em>Abb. </em>3) was a motion under \u00a7 122, for an interpleader to substitute rival claimants in place of defendants, the amount being liquidated. The sheriff was not a party to the suit or motion. The sufficiency of the levy was not even alluded to at Special Term by Hoffman, J., in granting the motion, though he wrote a careful opinion. The General Term, by Robertson, J., allude incidentally to the general notice, but place their decision entirely on other grounds and defects in the motion papers (11 <em>Abb. 7, </em>bottom of page).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b127-6\">Harmon <em>v. </em>Remsen (2 <em>Abb. A. 8, </em>272) was an action for an interpleader, brought against the sheriff and others, the amount involved being liquidated and paid into court. The notice served was less specific than in the present case, and the sheriff had taken no action to enforce his levy in any way, which fact is stated as the reason for the decision.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"74\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b127-7\">The former General Term decision in this case merely held that as <em>no notice </em>then appeared in the case, a motion to dismiss was properly made, no question of <em>sufficiency of </em>notice was before the court or passed upon at all.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"75\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b127-8\">5. The six months\u2019 limitation clause must be construed in connection with the sixty days\u2019 clause, and the action is, therefore, in time. The fire was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>October 36, 1868; suit begun June 18, 1869 (The Mayor <em>v. </em>Hamilton Fire Ins. Co., 39 <em>N. Y. </em>45; affirming same case, 10 <em>Bosw., </em>539 ; Ames <em>v. N. </em>Y. Union Ins. Co., 14 <em>N. Y. </em>365).</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"76\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b128-4\"><em>Walter M. Underhill, </em>attorney, and <em>George W. Parsons, </em>of counsel for defendant, urged :</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"77\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b128-5\">First\u20141. It is confidently submitted that a specific levy, according to section 335 of the Code, upon property incapable of manual delivery, cannot be made even by serving with the copy of the attachment a specific notice showing the property levied upon, without making or filing any inventory as required by section 333 and the statute referred <em>to; </em>and it is no answer to this to say that the party served did not or would not give any certificate or information sufficient to enable the sheriff to perform this duty. The case of Kelly <em>v. </em>Roberts (40 <em>If. Y. </em>p. 433), shows how the sheriff may proceed in such cases to perfect the levy, viz., by bringing up the creditor or person holding the intangible property before the judge, and examining him, under oath, pursuant to section 336 of the Code. Certainly it is not in the contemplation of the law to allow a sheriff to sue any one he may choose to, without complying with these requirements of the law, and without any express authority from the court of justice which issued the warrant. Section 333 expressly provides that the sheriff shall proceed, \u2018 \u2018 <em>subject to the direction of the court or judge.\u201d </em>And the court or judge could not acquire jurisdiction to give any directions; nor can the sheriff proceed to collect any debts or credits, until they are shown in the manner prescribed by law to have an existence, and just what they are, and that they have been sufficiently levied upon by the attachment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"78\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b128-6\">3. But the notice served with the attachment was not specific in stating the property intended to be levied on.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"79\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b129-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>3. It follows that no sufficient levy was ever made; plaintiff has no standing in court, and it is not shown that a cause of action existed in his favor, as sheriff, which he could prosecute under the Code (Kuhlman <em>v. </em>Orser, 5 <em>Duer. </em>242 ; Superior Court, General Term\u2014 Wilson v. Duncan, 11 <em>Abbt. </em>3 ; Orser <em>v. </em>Grossman, 4 <em>E. D. Smith, </em>443 ; Harman <em>v. </em>Remsen, 2 <em>Abbt. </em>[N. S.] 272; Wood <em>v. </em>Orser, 25 <em>N. Y.

R. </em>210).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"80\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b129-4\">Second.\u2014It does not obviate the difficulty stated in the preceding point, to say that the deputy-sheriff made some loose oral statements in respect to the property intended to be reached, at the time he served the process, nor to show that some agent of the defendant talked or wrote to the defendant in the attachment, in a manner to indicate that the agent knew what property it was designed to reach by the attachment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"81\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b129-5\">1. The statute requires that the sheriff should serve a \u201cnotice showing the property levied on;35 section 408 of the Code provides that all notices shall be in writing ; and this was requisite before as well as since the Code (Matter of Cooper, 15 <em>Johns. </em>533; Gilbert <em>v. </em>Columbian Turnpike Co., 3 <em>Johns.

The statements, both oral and written, made by Douglass, <em>after </em>the alleged service, were inadmissible.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"83\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b129-8\"><em>(a.) </em>Douglass had no connection whatever with defendant, except as chairman of a committee appointed by all the companies to inquire into, adjust, and settle the loss with Candler, and was not in any sense an agent to make declarations or admissions in regard to the service of the attachments. This proposition is too plain to need citations <em>of </em>cases to illustrate. Again :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"84\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b129-9\">(5.) There are numerous adjudications to the effect that neither the officers nor other agents of a corporation can, by their declarations or admissions, create any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>liability upon the company, after the question of liability has been fixed by acts or events as between the principals, or under the contract between the parties (Stephenson v.

In respect to the suggestion as to any waiver, I add that, to be bound by a waiver, a party must know of the existing defect, and proceed to act without taking the objection (Darnly <em>v. </em>London, etc., R.

In the recent case of Gilbert <em>v. </em>The Phoenix Ins. Co. (36 <em>N. Y.

It has also been repeatedly held that such a limita<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>tion was binding upon the parties to the contract and their privies <em>(vide </em>Ripley <em>v. </em>The \u00c6tna Ins.

The case of The Mayor, etc., <em>v. </em>Hamilton Ins. Co. (39 <em>N. Y.

We insist that the case referred to is not authority for a policy like the one in this case ; that, aside from authority, the plain definition of the word <em>\u201coccur\u201d </em>in our policy, distinguished this case from the one cited; and we refer to the case of Roach <em>v. </em>The N. Y., etc., Ins. Co. (30 <em>N. Y. </em>546), to show how the Court of Appeals has interpreted it <em>(vide, </em>also, Riddlesberger <em>v. </em>Hartford Ins.

They are to be executed by leaving a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>certified copy of the warrant of attachment with the person or corporation holding such property, \u201cwith a notice showing the property levied upon.\u201d Section 236 furnishes the sheriff with the means of obtaining a dis-' closure <em>of </em>all the particulars necessary to enable him to describe the property intended to be levied upon with due particularity. He may apply to the person holding the property for a certificate designating the amount and description of the property so held. In case the certificate be refused, it may be compelled.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-4\">In Kuhlman <em>v. </em>Orser, 5 <em>Duer, </em>242, this court expressly held, as one of the grounds upon which judgment absolute was ordered for the plaintiff upon the verdict, that the requirement of the said 235th section can only be satisfied by a notice which so particularly describes the property, that the holder is thereby enabled to identify it, and that a notice, general in its terms and containing no specification of the particular property meant to be levied on, is insufficient and void.'</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">This decision has since been followed by this court in Wilson <em>v. </em>Duncan (11 <em>Abb. </em>3), and expressly approved by the Court of Appeals in Clarke <em>v. </em>Goodridge (41 <em>N. Y. </em>210). It is true, that in another report of the last-named case, contained in 44 <em>Row. </em>226, an attempt has been made to show that the opinion of Chief Justice Hunt, upon the point now under consideration, was not concurred in by a majority of the court, and was not necessary to the decision of that case. But the printed cases in Clarke <em>v. </em>Goodridge and Drake <em>v. </em>Goodridge, which were handed up by defendants\u2019 counsel, and a critical examination of the opinions published in 44 <em>Row. </em>in the light which the printed records throw upon them, decidedly show that although there were two motions in these cases, which may have been argued together in the .Court of Appeals, they had, nevertheless, been disposed of originally by two different <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>judges of the Supreme Court, and that they involved essentially different questions, which were ultimately disposed of hy the Court of Appeals as follows :</p>\n<p id=\"b133-3\">In the one case the order was reversed for the reason stated by Chief Justice Hunt, and concurred in by all the judges except Daniels and James, that the notice served by the sheriff upon the National Bank of the Bepublic did not specify sufficiently the property intended to be levied on, and did not refer to the interest of the debtor in such property with reasonable certainty.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-4\">In the other case the order was reversed for the reason stated in the opinions of Grover and Scott, JJ., namely, that it did not appear that the sheriff had at <em>any </em>time made an attempt in <em>any </em>way to serve the attachment, while it was in his hands, upon the debt due from Verhoven <em>&amp; </em>Co. to Goodridge ; that consequently the attachment never had been a lien on the fund, and that upon its return the sheriff\u2019s power under it had ceased. Mr. Justice Grover was therefore entirely correct in saying (44 <em>How. </em>229) that the sufficiency of the <em>notice </em>served by the sheriff upon the National Bank of the Bepublic, in the case first above referred to, had nothing to do with the second case.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">The doctrine first laid down in Kuhlman v. Orser <em>(supra) </em>represents, therefore, not only the settled law of this court, but the law of this State as settled by the Court of Appeals, and from this it follows- that the notices served in the case at bar which purported to cover generally all the property, real and personal, money, bank-notes, books of account, and vouchers and papers relating thereto and the debts, credits, and effects of Candler in the possession of or under the control of the defendant, and which were not followed up by the procurement of a certificate and the returning of an inventory, were wholly insufficient to work a levy upon Candler\u2019s claim under the policy in question.</p>\n<p id=\"AGe\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>This being so, the sheriff is not in a position to maintain this action ; and the defect could not be cured by proof that subsequent to its commencement, but long after the limitation of the six months prescribed by the policy for its commencement, had attached, he made a new levy accompanied by a proper notice. Such a contract of limitation is valid, and will be enforced by the courts (Roach <em>v. </em>The N. Y. &amp; Erie Ins. Co., 30 N. <em>Y. </em>546, and The Mayor, etc., of N. Y. <em>v. </em>The Hamilton Fire Ins. Co., 39 N. <em>Y. </em>45). Nor could the defect be obviated by mere conversations between the deputy sheriff and defendants\u2019 officers. The remedy given by the 235th section is not merely cumulative, but is the only remedy known to the law in the cases there mentioned, and must be strictly pursued.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-4\">Plaintiff\u2019s exceptions must be overruled and judgment absolute, dismissing the complaint, ordered for the defendant, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">Barbour, C. J., and Sedgwick, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
