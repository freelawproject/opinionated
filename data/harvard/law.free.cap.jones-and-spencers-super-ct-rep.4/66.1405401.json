Y. </em>251; referred to, and approved, in the opinion of the court in the case of Schofield <em>v. </em>Whitelegge, 49 <em>N.

The allegation in the complaint or the subject of the plaintiff\u2019s cause of action is as follows :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-16\">\u201c That the defendants have become possessed of, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>\u201cwrongfully detain from the plaintiff, the following \u201cgoods and chattels of the plaintiff, that is to say, two \u201c cart wheels,\u201d etc., etc., \u201cof the value of,\u201d etc., etc.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">The defendant demurred to the complaint, and assigned as causes of demurrer :</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">First. \u20181 That the complaint does not contain facts or \u2022allegations sufficient to constitute a cause of action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"ADT\">Second. \u201cThe said complaint does not show that the \u25a0plaintiff is or ever was the owner of the property in the complaint claimed, nor that he had any interest in the same, or any part thereof, nor that he is or ever was lawfully or otherwise entitled to the possession of the same, nor that he has any interest in the same, \"by reason or virtue of any special property therein, nor does it show the actual value of the same.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b75-7\">In support of the demurrer we were referred on the argument to the case of Schofield <em>v. </em>Whitelegge in the Court of Appeals, reported in 12 <em>Abb. </em>N. <em>S. </em>page 820, S. E. 49th N. <em>Y. </em>259.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-8\">But the complaint in that case, which was held to \"be insufficient, alleged \u201cthat the defendant had \"become \u201cpossessed of, and detained from the plaintiff, the foliow\u201cing property,\u201d etc. The words \u201c the goods and chattels of the plaintiff\u201d were omitted. On this point the complaint in the case of Levin <em>v. </em>Bussell, 42 IF <em>Y. </em>251, was referred to \"by the learned judge who delivered the opinion in Schofield <em>v. </em>Whitelegge\u2022 with approval. In the case of Levin <em>v. </em>Bussell the words of the complaint were \u201c the following goods and chattels of the plaintiff,\u2019\u2019 which were held \"by Judge Folger to be in conformity with the precedents in such cases, and to impart ownership in the plaintiff*.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-9\">In Pattison <em>v. </em>Adams, 7 <em>Hill, </em>127, Mr. Justice Beardslee says: \u2018 \u2018 The usual allegation is, that the goods taken or detained were <em>the goods of the plaintiff, </em>and. that words of equivalent import might be substituted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b75-10\">We are of opinion that the allegation in the complaint <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>is sufficient and imparts ownership in the plaintiff of the-goods. The value of the property is sufficiently stated..</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">The order and judgment appealed from is reversed,, and judgment ordered in favor of the plaintiff on the demurrer, with costs of the demurrer and appeal, with liberty to defendant to answer in twenty days.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">Barbour, Ch. J., and Monell, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
