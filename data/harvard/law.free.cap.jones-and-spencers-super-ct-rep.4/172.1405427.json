The building was about 84 feet in length, 16 feet in width, on Newark Avenue; 13 feet in width on Montgomery Street, and 19 feet wide in the middle.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b181-5\">A fire occurred in the store on the 23d of December, 1869, and caused substantially a total destruction of the property. The plaintiffs claimed a total loss of $7,404.22, and that there was also $1,207.12 worth of stock damaged to the extent of $842.75, making total amount of stock claimed to have been on hand at the time of the fire of $8,611.34, on which the claimed loss was $8,246.97.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b181-6\">The defendant resisted payment on the ground, among others, that the claim was fraudulent, in that the amount of stock claimed to have been on hand and totally destroyed was grossly exaggerated, and exceeded the amount actually on hand by at least $3,500.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b181-7\">To establish the fraudulent character of the claim it was shown, among other things, that the receipts of plaintiff had for the last year and half been constantly decreasing, so that during the last six months they were only one-fourth of what they had been a year and a half previously ; that nearly one-half of the stock claimed to have been destroyed consisted, as was claimed, of eighty-five half chests of tea, containing fifty pounds each, of the value of $1 a pound, amounting to $4,250 ; that plaintiffs claimed to have had forty-five of. these eighty-five half chests on hand for about two and a half years, and also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>claimed that these forty-five half chests contained different varieties of black tea; it was further shown that plaintiffs had, notwithstanding this, been during those two and a half years in the habit of making constant purchases to a considerable extent of the same varieties of tea as was contained in the forty-five half chests. There was also evidence that tea deteriorates by being kept, and if kept two and a half years would deteriorate from five to ten cents a pound. It also appeared that the plaintiffs had given three different statements, under oath, as to number of half-chests they had on hand.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b182-5\">The proofs of loss showed that during the seven months preceding the fire plaintiffs\u2019 purchases had been $14,711.71, and their sales $18,147,49.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b182-6\">In this state of the evidence defendant\u2019s counsel called as a witness William A.

The case appears to have been ably, fully, and fairly tried, and to have been submitted to the jury under an elaborate charge to which no valid exception will lie. There seem to be but two exceptions which deserve to be specially noticed.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>The first relates to the exclusion of certain testimony offered by defendant with a view of showing the line of teas which other retail grocers than the plaintiffs carry in Jersey City and in certain parts of the city of Yew York, according to their stock and the size of their stores. The object was to thereby discredit the testimony of one of the plaintiffs as to the amount of tea claimed to have been on hand at the time of the fire. The proposed inquiry, therefore, was not as to the existence of a general, uniform, and unvarying custom, with which to charge the plaintiffs, assuming that such could be done, but as to the business habits of a limited number of third parties engaged in a somewhat similar business. Such evidence is incompetent. Phoenix Fire Ins. Co. <em>v. </em>Philip (13 <em>Wend. </em>81), is an express authority upon this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">The other exception relates to the reception in evidence of an offer of compromise by defendant. Yo question was raised as to any want of authority in the agent who made it, but defendant objected solely upon the ground that it is incompetent to prove offers of settlement. The testimony was admitted as bearing upon the question of the sufficiency of the proofs of loss, and such sufficiency was a controverted question in the case. The policy provided that until such proofs be furnished, the loss should not become due and payable.- Upon this point the evidence was admissible. Yor did it appear that the offer was made without prejudice, or upon the faith of the success of a pending negotiation. It is only confidential overtures of pacification, and offers or propositions expressly stated to be made without prejudice, that are excluded on grounds of public policy (1, <em>Greenl. on Ev. </em>\u00a7 192). Yo error was therefore committed in admitting said evidence for the purpose referred to, and no harm can have accrued from its reception to the defendant for the reason that upon the other branch of the case the jury were expressly instructed to render a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>verdict for the defendant absolutely, in case they found that plaintiffs had been guilty of any fraud. Upon this latter point the charge was emphatic, and if it was not explicit enough to suit the views of defendants\u2019 counsel, the court might and should have been requested to specifically cover the point alleged to have been left in doubt. But no such request was made as regarded the said offer.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">The judgment should be affirmed with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">Barbour, Ch. J., and Sedgwick, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
