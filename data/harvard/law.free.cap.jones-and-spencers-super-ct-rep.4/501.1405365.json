On the second of November, 1868, plaintiff, being the owner for value of a check for $550, dated that day, drawn on said Portchester Bank, by said Merritt to his own order, and endorsed by him, endorsed the same and deposited it with the defendant as a bank for collection, and at the time of such deposit paid to the defendant in cash, under the aforesaid agreement, a sum equal to one-eighth of one per cent, on the amount thereof; and the defendant forthwith credited to plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>tiff\u2019s account on its books, and in plaintiff\u2019s pass-book, the full amount of the check, and this credit was made in the same form and manner as any deposit of a customer with his bank is ordinarily made ; it was credited in the same form and manner as the amount would have been had it consisted of bills instead of a check.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b511-4\">The ordinary course of the defendant\u2019s business with respect to checks such as the one in question was for defendant\u2019s cashier to enclose the same in a sealed envelope, properly directed to the Portchester National Bank, with the postage thereon prepaid, and to place such envelope in a private box of the defendant, to which it was the duty and ordinary course of business of the porter of the defendant to go twice a day, and take therefrom such letters or envelopes as he found there, and deposit the same in the post-office. The duties thus imposed on the cashier and porter of the defendant they performed November 2d, 1868. The plaintiff was aware, prior to November 2d, that the defendant was in the practice of collecting the checks drawn by Merritt on the Portchester National Bank, deposited with it by plaintiff for collection, through the mails.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b511-5\">According to the due and ordinary course of mail and business, a check mailed as aforesaid on November 2d, would reach the Portchester National Bank on the following morning, November 3d, and the defendant, which at that time was nearly every day in correspondence with the Portchester National Bank, would receive from said Portchester National Bank advice of such check on November 4th.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b511-6\">The check in question never was received by, nor was it ever presented at the Portchester National Bank, and no demand for the payment of this check was ever made upon the Portchester National Bank by the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b511-7\">On November 16th, 1868, defendant\u2019s cashier discov<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>erecl for the first time that the check in question had never been received by the Portohester National Bank. On the same day the cashier returned to New York, and on the 18th day of November, 1868, notified the plaintiff, by letter, that the check in question had never been received by the Portohester National Bank, and that, if the check was not found, defendant would ask plaintiff for a duplicate. This was the first notice that the plaintiff had that said check had not been paid, and was the first notice of any kind the plaintiff had as to anything in relation to said check after its deposit by him with, the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b512-4\">From November 18th, 1868, until January 7th, 1869, the defendant made various requests of the plaintiff to procure a duplicate check, and otherwise assist defendant in obtaining payment of the amount of this check from Merritt or the Portohester Bank. On November 25th, 1868, defendant demanded a duplicate check from plaintiff. On December 4th, 1868, defendant, by letter, offered to give plaintiff a bond to indemnify Merritt in. the premises, if Merritt so desired. On December 22d, 1868, defendant sent plaintiff such a bond unexecuted, which plaintiff returned, and on December 31st, 1868, defendant again sent plaintiff such a bond duly executed, which plaintiff again returned, and on that day the defendant charged\" the amount of this check to the plaintiff\u2019s account, and on January 7th, 1869, plaintiff having drawn all moneys due to him from defendant, except an amount equal to the amount of this check, demanded the amount of this check from the defendant, and the. defendant refused to pay the same. During all the time from November 2d, 1868, until December 31st,. 1868, the amount of this check remained credited to plaintiff\u2019s account on the books of the defendant and on plaintiff\u2019s pass-book, and during that period, plaintiff frequently drew his account with defendant, including the check in question, down so that his balance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>amounted to less than the amount of the check in question, and his book was balanced by the defendant on the 18th day of December, 1868, and the balance then struck included the credit to plaintiff of the amount of the check in question. The Portchester National Bank has continued its business since November 2d, 1868, without interruption, and has remained solvent.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b513-4\">On the 15th and 16th days of November, 1868, Merritt had on deposit in the Portchester Bank more money than was sufficient to pay the check in question.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b513-5\">On the 21st and 25th of November, 1868, Merritt paid plaintiff' an aggregate of $575. At the time of the receipt of this money there was no <em>debt due </em>from Merritt to plaintiff other than the check in question. Neither party made any specific appropriation of this money at the time, but afterwards, other checks of Merritt\u2019s which plaintiff had cashed having been returned protested, the plaintiff made an application of the $575 toward the payment of those checks. . \u2022</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b513-6\">This action was brought to recover from defendant the amount of the check of November 2d, 1868, the complaint alleging that defendant discounted the check and placed the proceeds to his account, but failed to pay them over on demand.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b513-7\">The answer denied that defendant discounted the check, and pleaded the above matters in bar. \u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b513-8\">The cause was tried before the court, a jury trial being waived. The learned judge before whom the trial was had found the above facts, and as conclusions of law from them found that defendant was liable for the amount of the check, by reason of its negligence in not discovering the loss prior to November 15th, 1869, and in not notifying the plaintiff thereof until N ovember 19 th, 1863, and in not having demanded payment of the check from the Portchester Bank as a lost check, and that the plaintiff had the right to apply the money received November 21st and 25th to and upon the then subse<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>quent indebtedness, and was not bound to apply the same to the check in question, and that plaintiff was entitled to recover the amount of the check in question from defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b514-4\">On these findings judgment was entered against defendant for plaintiff, and defendant appeals therefrom.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b514-5\"><em>James R. </em>Marvin, attorney, and <em>F.

The plaintiff was credited with the amount of this check on defendant\u2019s books from November 2d, 1868, until December 31st, 1868, and during all this time plaintiff was allowed to, and did, draw his account down so that his balance was reduced to an amount less than the check in question. While this state of facts existed, plaintiff had no claim against Merritt on this check. The defendant had such claim, if any one. There was no debt due plaintiff from Merritt on this check until December 31st, 1868, and the checks and money were received November 21st and 25th, 1868, and could not be applied by either plaintiff or the law to a subsequent debt of December 31st, 1868 (Thomas <em>v. </em>Kelsey, 30 <em>Barb. </em>268; Baker <em>v. </em>Stackpoole, 9 <em>Cow. </em>420; Niagara Bank <em>v. </em>Rosevelt, <em>9 Cow. </em>409 ; Hunter <em>v. </em>Osterhoudt, 11 <em>Barb. </em>33 ; Seymour <em>v. </em>Van Slyck, 8 <em>Wend. </em>403).</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b519-4\">By the Court.\u2014Monell, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AFZO\">The check which the defendant undertook to collect, as the agent of the plaintiff, having been lost, the latter, as soon as he was apprized of the loss, had a right of action upon it as upon a lost instrument, upon giving notice of the loss to the drawer and tendering a sufficient indemnity. The loss of the check, and the consequent inability of the holder to make a presentment, did not relieve the drawer of his liability to the holder. If it was necessary to go-through the forms of demand and protest, that duty rested upon the plaintiff and not upon the bank. Immediately upon receiving notice of the loss, the plaintiff was bound to give notice to the drawer, and to do all that he was required to do to fix the liability of the drawer; then, upon an offer of indemnity, he could have legally demanded payment (2 <em>Pars, on Con. </em>262; Freeman <em>v. </em>Boyston, <em>7 </em>Mass., 483, 486).</p>\n<p id=\"b520-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>It is clear, therefore, that if the plaintiff took the proper steps to fix the liability of the drawer of the check as upon a lost instrument,' there was' a present indebtedness from him to the plaintiff on the 18th of November, to the amount of the lost check.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-4\">That was the legal status of those parties on that day.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">The question then arises, whether the subsequent payments made by Merritt should operate as a payment or satisfaction of such indebtedness.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">On the 21st and 25th of November Merritt paid to plaintiff the aggregate of five hundred and seventy five dollars, a sum sufficient to satisfy or pay his indebtedness upon the lost check. At that time <em>there was no other debt dxoe from Merritt to the plaintiff. </em>Neither party made any specific appropriation of the money at the time, but <em>afterwards </em>other checks of Merritt which the plaintiff had cashed having been returned protested, the plaintiff made an appropriation of the $575 towards the payment of these checks.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-7\">The law in regard to the appropriation of payments is this: The debtor may direct its application to any debt. If he makes no application, the creditor may apply it to any demand. If neither makes any specific application, the law will apply it to the eldest claim (2 <em>Pars, on Cont. </em>144, 145).</p>\n<p id=\"b520-8\">No appropriation or application of the money paid by Merritt was made by either party at the time of payment. It could not be applied <em>afterwards </em>to the prejudice of other parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-9\">Not only under the rule I have stated was the application due to the debt evidenced by the lost check as being the oldest debt, but it was in fact the <em>only debt due at the time </em>of payment, and therefoie entitled to a priority (Stone <em>v. </em>Seymour, 15 <em>Wend. </em>19). The plaintiff could not wait, after the payment, until another debt became due, and then apply the payment to the extinguishment of the newly created demand, leaving <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>the previous demand unpaid (Baker <em>v. </em>Kauffman, 9 <em>Cow. </em>420).</p>\n<p id=\"b521-4\">I am satisfied, therefore, that the defence of payment was sustained hy the evidence, and should have prevailed at the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">I am also of the opinion that the learned justice was in error in respect to the other branch of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">His conclusion of law is <em>\u201c </em>that by reason of the negligence of the defendant in not discovering the loss of the check prior to November 15th, 1868, and in not notifying the plaintiff thereof until November 18th, 1868, and in not having demanded payment of the check from the Portchester National Bank as of a lost check, the defendant, upon the facts found, became liable to the plaintiff for the full amount of the said check.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b521-7\">It is doubtless true that the defendant, having undertaken to collect the check, is to be held liable for all injury caused by its negligence. It was not responsible for the loss of the check; nor was it, in my judgment, bound to make presentment of it as a lost check. It seems to me that its only duty to the plaintiff was to ascertain within a reasonable time that the check had not reached its destination, and then to give notice to him of the loss. All duty in respect to it then passed to the plaintiff, who was bound to tender to the drawer a suitable indemnity and demand payment of the lost instrument. For any negligence of the defendant, in not duly ascertaining the loss of the check, it would be liable, as already said, for any injury that might thereby be caused to the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-8\">At the time the plaintiff received notice from his agent, the defendant, of the loss of the check, namely, on the 18th of November, the drawer of the check was solvent and able to pay. On that and the succeeding day his balance in bank was much more than sufficient to pay the check, and there was no proceeding against his property until the 28th of November. The plaintiff, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>therefore, could hy diligence have enforced his claim against the drawer of the check, and prevented a loss. And had he, as I think he should have done, demanded payment of Merritt, with an offer of indemnity, it is probable the money would have been paid. At any rate, he had an immediate cause of action for the recovery of the amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-4\">The error of the learned judge was in enlarging the duty of the defendant beyond that of giving notice of the loss of the check, for he says it was also negligent in not demanding payment as of a lost check. That was no part of its duty, but if any demand was necessary, it devolved upon the plaintiff\u2019 to make it after he was apprized of the loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">The defendant undertook merely to collect the check, and was bound to reasonable diligence only. The loss of the check was not attributable to any act of the defendant, and imposed no other obligation than to give notice of the loss. If it negligently omitted reasonable diligence in discovering the loss, for that neglect it may be liable, provided the plaintiff was injured by reason of it; but that is the limit and extent of its liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">But I do not think any presentation was necessary, as the omission to do so would have been no defence by the drawer, unless he could have shown some injury (Etting <em>v. </em>Shook, <em>2 Hall, </em>459 ; Conroy <em>v. </em>Warren, 3 <em>John Cas. </em>259).</p>\n<p id=\"b522-7\">For both the reasons above assigned I think the judgment should be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to the appellants to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-8\">Freedman, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b522-9\">Barbour, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AiV\">I concur in reversing the judgment appealed from, but for one only of the reasons stated in the opinion of Judge Monell. \u2022 As the drawer of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>\u25a0check was not indebted to the plaintiff otherwise than on the check, when the $575 was received from the former by the latter, and as nothing was said by either touching the purpose or object to which the $575 was to be applied, the receipt of that sum by the plaintiff operated in law as a payment of the check.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
