The provision that the property shall be thus kept and stored at the owner\u2019s risk of fire, loss, etc., was intended to cover such injury or loss as might be sustained while the goods were thus stored. The property remained in the possession of the carriers, therefore, under their con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>tract, at the time such goods were delivered Tby their servants to the thief. The defendants are therefore liable to the plaintiffs for the loss of the goods, and the latter must have j udgment upon the. verdict accordingly, with \u201ccosts.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">Morell and Freedmar, JJ., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">Rote.'\u2014See the' case of Gleadell <em>d. </em>Thomson <em>(Superior Court Deports, </em>vol. 35 [3 <em>Jones &amp; Spencet'], </em>p. 232), decided at General Term, February, 1873.
