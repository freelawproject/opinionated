POHALSKI, Plaintiff and Respodent, <em>v. </em>THE MUTUAL LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY, Defendant and Appellant.</parties>\n<headnotes data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b242-5\">Interpretation of a permit issued by a life insurance company, under a policy issued to plaintiff upon the life of her husband, upon his application in her name, and as her agent, for that purpose, and the admissibility of parol evidence to explain or vary its language.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b242-6\">The words of the permit are as follows: \u201cPermission is hereby given to J. M. Pohalski to proceed to Cuba, and return before April 1st, 1871. Ho to take his own risk of death from epidemics. \u201d Mr. Pohalski, the husband of the insured, obtained this permit Jannary 23d, 1871, and soon after proceeded to the city of Havana, island of Cuba, and while there was seized with a sudden and fatal illness, and died of such illness, February 22d, 1871. That the disease of which Pohalski died was yellow fever.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b242-7\">The yellow fever did not prevail <em>as an epidemic </em>in Havana at any time in the month of December, 1870, or in January or February, 1871, and did not prevail or exist there as an epidemic when the said Pohalski took the disease and died of the same.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b242-8\">On the trial the defendant claimed the right, and offered to show that when Pohalski applied for the permit, the issuance of the same was objected to by the president of the defendant, on the ground of the risk the defendant would run by reason of the prevalence of yellow fever in Cuba at all seasons of the year, and that the permit was finally issued to him, upon the express condition and agreement that he would take his own risk of death from yellow fever. That the parties in their conversation with respect to the permit specified yellow fever and cholera as the diseases intended to be announced by the language used in the permit.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b242-9\">The defendant also offered to show by Dr. Elisha Harris, claimed to be a well-known physician and authority on sanitary subjects, that yellow fever is properly classified in medical science, and known as belonging to diseases called epidemics; that yellow fever, whenever it exists in the city of New York, where the permit was given, is always an epidemic; that yellow fever exists at all times in Havana, and is the peculiarly fatal disease of that climate, and is especially dangerous to strangers, and to persons from the Northern States visiting Havana. All these offers were objected to by plaintiff, and the proffered evidence was excluded on the trial, and exception taken by defendant to the ruling of the court.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b242-10\"><em>Held, </em>by the General Term, That the ruling of the court below was correct.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b242-11\">That the permit was in writing as required by the policy, and it was issued as contemplated by the policy, and in modification of the same, or as a waiver of one of its conditions, and it must be taken to be the repository and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>evidence of the final intention, understanding, and agreement of the parties, and all oral testimony of a <em>previous colloquium </em>between the parties, or of declarations made at the time of its completion or afterwards, should be rejected.</headnotes>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b243-8\">Before Freedman, Curtis, and Van Vorst, JJ.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b243-10\"><em>Decided June </em>28, 1873.</decisiondate>\n<headnotes data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b243-5\">That although the permit was issued without any new consideration, and the company was not bound by the terms of the policy to give it, yet, having given it, <em>it is bound by </em>it, because it springs out of, and is based upon, the consideration and terms of the policy; and therefore, whether the said permit be regarded as a modification of the original contract of insurance, or as a waiver of certain of the conditions of the policy, the rule which holds that parol contemporaneous evidence is inadmissible to change its legal effect, is equally applicable (Buckley <em>v. </em>Bentley, 48 <em>Barb. </em>283).</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b243-6\">That it not appearing that the word \u2018 \u2018 epidemics \u201d was used and understood . by the parties in any other sense than in its plain, ordinary, and popular-sense as a familiar word in the English language, no evidence of any kind, from any other source, was therefore admissible to change that meaning (Baptist Church in Brooklyn v. Brooklyn Fire Insurance Co. 28 <em>N. Y. </em>153; Neff <em>v. </em>Friedman, 2 Sweeney, 607). That the company meant to ; stipulate, and did stipulate for exemption from liability from <em>any </em>disease that might by any possibility prevail in Cuba to an extent which could be called <em>epidemic.</em></headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b243-7\">It was also held to be a fact of some significance in interpreting the permit, that it required PohalsM to return from Cuba before the first day of April.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b243-11\">Appeal from a judgment entered upon the report of a referee in favor of the plaintiff, in an action brought upon a life policy.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b243-12\">The referee\u2019s findings were substantially as follows, in regard to the important facts of the case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b243-13\">That prior to and on the fourth day of June, in the year 1866, the plaintiff was the wife of Jacob M.

Pohalski, whereby the defendant assured the life of the said Jacob M. Pohalski, for the sole use of the plaintiff as his wife, in the amount \u2018of five thousand dollars, for the term of Ms natural life. By which said policy the defendant promised and agreed to pay to the plaintiff, if living, for her sole use, the amount of the said insurance, at its office in the city of New York, in conformity with the statute, in sixty days after due notice and proof of the death of the said Jacob M. Pohalski, the balance of the year\u2019s premium,, if any, being first deducted therefrom.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b244-5\">That the said policy contained the condition, that if the said Jacob M.

Pohalski, made and delivered, without charging or receiving extra premium therefor, a consent in writing in accordance with the terms of said policy, by which per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>mission was given to the said Jacob M.

Pohalski soon thereafter proceeded to the city of Havana, in the island of Cuba, and while there was seized with a sudden and fatal illness, and on the 22d day of February, 1871, died of such illness.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b245-6\">That the disease of which the said Jacob M. Pohalski so died was yellow fever.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b245-7\">That though yellow fever, in Havana and the island of Cuba is an endemic or an endemical or indigenous disease, and though there occasionally occur, in Havana, in the winter months, from time to time, a few sporadic cases of that disease, yet it rarely prevails or exists in Havana in the winter months as an epidemic, or in the form or condition or to the extent of an epidemic, and did not prevail or exist in Havana, in the form or condition or to the extent of an epidemic, or as an epidemic, at any time in the month of December, 1870, or in the month of January or in the month of February, 1871, and was not an epidemic in Havana, and did not prevail or exist in Havana, in the form or condition or to the extent of an epidemic, when the said Jacob M. Pohalski took the said disease in Havana as aforesaid, or when he died in Havana of that disease as aforesaid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b245-8\">That the said Jacob M.

That the death of said Jacob M. Pohalski occurred under circumstances bringing it within the risk assumed by the defendent in issuing the said policy.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b246-7\">2. That the plaintiff fulfilled all the conditions of the said policy on her part, and that the sam\u00e9 was in full life and force at the time of the death of the said Jacob M. Pohalski, and has evei since remained, and still is in full life and force.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b246-8\">3. That the plaintiff is entitled to recover from the defendant the said sum of five thousand dollars, and the said sum of six hundred and twenty-two dollars and fourteen cents, both amounting to the sum of five thousand six hundred and twenty-two dollars and fourteen cents, and interest on the same from the 18th day of May, 1871, to the date of this my report, which interest amounts to the sum of six hundred and twenty-three dollars and twelve cents, making the whole sum which the plaintiff is entitled to recover from the defendant six thousand two hundred and forty-five dollars and twenty-six cents.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b246-9\">To each of which findings of fact and of law the defendant duly and separately excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b246-10\">And as additional findings of fact, at the request of the defendant; the referee found as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b246-11\">1. For the seven years previous to 1871, the number of annual deaths in Havana from yellow fever were from 500 to 1,000, independent of the Spanish army.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b246-12\">2.

Yellow fever is a disease'climatic in its nature, and peculiar to the climate of Havana. .</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b247-5\">4. As a further additional finding of fact, the defendant requested the said referee to find that yellow fever is generally known and classified among the division of diseases called \u201cepidemics,\u201d which the said referee refused to do, to which refusal the said defendant duly excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b247-6\">5. As a further additional finding of fact, the defendant requested the said referee to find that the word \u201c epidemics\u201d has in general use two proper meanings.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b247-7\"><em>a. </em>A class definition including any diseases that may or may not (but generally do) exist in an epidemic form.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b247-8\"><em>b. </em>Diseases existing at the time when the definition is applied in an epidemic condition, or to an epidemic extent.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b247-9\">Which the said referee refused to do, to which refusal the said defendant duly excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b247-10\">6. As a further additional finding of fact, the defendant requested the said referee to find that in the findings of fact contained in the report as signed, the word \u201cepidemics\u201d is used in the sense conceived by the referee to be that in which the word was used by the contracting parties in the permit referred to in the case, viz., ns a disease existing at the time when the definition is to be applied, in an epidemic condition, or to an epidemic extent; which the said referee refused to do, to which refusal the said defendant duly excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b247-11\">The rulings of the referee on the trial, appear in the opinion of the court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b247-12\"><em>Henry E. Davies </em>and <em>Julien T. Davies </em>for appellant, argued as follows:</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b247-13\">Looking at the permit in the case, in view of the facts that stand admitted and were not disputed, viz., that the deceased could not go to Cuba without forfeiting the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>policy, unless by permission ; that he made application for a permit to visit the island of Cuba during the month of January, 1871, and that in consequence of such application this permit was issued to him, the question first presents itself, what is the meaning to be given to the expression, \u201che to take his own risk of death from epidemics \u201d ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b248-5\">On the part of the plaintiff it is claimed that these words confine the risk to be taken, to such diseases as may exist in an epidemic form or to an epidemic extent. On the part of the defendant, it is claimed that these words, even if susceptible of the meaning sought to be given them by the plaintiff, also imply that the deceased was to take his own risk of such diseases as are properly known and classified among epidemics, for the reason that they' generally exist as epidemics. On the part of the plaintiff it is contended, that as yellow fever did not exist to an epidemic extent when Jacob M. Pohalski died of that disease at Havana, the company is liable. On the part of the defendant it is claimed that as yellow fever generally exists to an epidemic extent, and is generally classified and named among the epidemics or epidemic diseases, that the defendant is not liable.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b248-6\">A distinction may be drawn between the word \u201c epidemic\u201d in the singular, and \u201c epidemics\u201d in the plural. An epidemic, in the singular, is a disease affecting many , people. Epidemics, in the plural, are those diseases that generally exist epidemically, but they may or may not exist epidemically at the time spoken of, and, as a class definition, is used, and properly used, to include such diseases as generally exist to an epidemic extent in their manifestations. Any one of the epidemics, when manifested, does not always cause an epidemic, but an epidemic is always caused by one of the epidemics. When the diseases themselves are sought to be classified, they are called epidemics, and when the manifestation of one of them is in view, and it is spoken of with refer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>ence prominently to that manifestation, the term \u201can epidemic\u201d is used.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b249-5\">\u201cEpidemics,\u201d as a definition, is easily understood, and its meaning can be accurately defined by reference to the medical works giving a list of diseases classified as epidemics ; but if the intention was to cover only a disease that was to exist to an epidemic extent] at the time the definition was to be applied, the parties were contracting with reference to a very loose and undeterminate term.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b249-6\">An examination of the use of the word in literature will show that the meaning here applied to the word \u201cepidemics,\u201d is a proper and legitimate one.

So, too, in the press, nearly every day there appears some reference to disease breaking out or prevailing somewhere, in which the word is used, and never in any other sense than that given by Webster.

It also frequently appears in the newspapers, expressed in its true sense. STo longer ago than April 26th, the papers in this city contained the following dispatch:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"78\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b253-8\">\u201cVienna, April 25th, 1873.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"79\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b253-9\">\u201c There were twenty cases of <em>sporadic </em>cholera\u2014scattered, individual attacks\u2014brought to hospital yester\u201cday.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"80\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b253-10\">The true construction of this permit, then, can admit \u25a0of no doubt.

Pohalski, plaintiff\u2019s husband, for the sole use of the plaintiff, in the amount of five thousand dollars, for the term of his natural life. It was issued and accepted upon the express condition enumerated therein,, that if the said Jacob M. Pohalski should pass beyond <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>certain limits, specifically described therein, without the consent of the company, given in writing, it should be null and void. Subsequently permission in writing was given to Mr. Pohalski to proceed to. Cuba, a place within the prohibition of the policy, by the following permit:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-5\">\u201cPermission is hereby given to J. M. Pohalski . . . \u201cto proceed to Cuba, and return before April 1, 1871. \u201c He to take his own risk of death from epidemics.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">Mr. Pohalski proceeded to Cuba, and died in the city of Havana in the month of February, 1871. As to the cause of his death, the referee, upon sufficient testimony, found as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-7\">\u201c That the disease of which the said Jacob M. Pohalski so died was yellow fever.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-8\">\u201c That though yellow fever, in Havana and the island of Cuba, is an endemic, or an endemical or indigenous disease, ahd though there occasionally occur in Havana, in the winter months, from time to time, a few sporadic cases of that disease, yet it rarely prevails or exists in Havana in the winter months as an epidemic, or in the form or condition or to the extent of an epidemic, and did not prevail or exist in Havana, in the form or condition or to the extent of an epidemic, or as an epidemic, at any time in the month of December, 1870, or in the month of January, or in the month of February, 1871, and was not an epidemic in Havana, and did not prevail' or exist in Havana, in the form or condition or to the extent of an epidemic, when the said Jacob M. Pohalski took the said disease in Havana as aforesaid, when he died in Havana of that disease as aforesaid.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-9\">\u201c That the said Jacob M. Pohalski did not die of an epidemic, or of a disease prevailing or existing at Havana epidemically, or in the form or condition or to the extent of an epidemic, either when he was seized with the disease with which he died or when he died.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b256-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>Upon these facts the referee found, as a conclusion of law \u2022-</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">That the death of said Jacob M. Pohalski occurred under circumstances bringing it within the risk assumed by the defendant in issuing the said policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">The defendant, upon the trial, claimed the right to show that when Mr. Pohalski applied for the permit to visit the island of Cuba, the issuance of it was objected to by the president of the defendant, on the ground of <em>the </em>risk <em>the </em>defendant would run by reason of the prevalence of yellow fever in the island of Cuba at all seasons of the year, and that the permit was finally issued to said Pohalski, upon the express condition and agreement that he would take his own risk of death from yellow fever; that the parties, in their conversation with respect to the permit, used the word \u201cepidemics\u201d as including yellow fever and cholera as diseases, without any reference to their existing in an epidemic form or to an epidemic extent at any particular time, and that the word was so used in the permit. The evidence, however, of the conversation between Mr. Pohalski and Mr. Winston, showing their use, and their intent in the use of the word epidemics, was excluded, and to its exclusion the defendant duly excepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-7\">The defendant also offered to show, by Dr. Elisha Harris, a well-known physician and authority on sanitary subjects, that yellow fever is properly classified in medical science, and known as belonging to diseases called epidemics ; that yellow fever, whenever it exists in the city of New York, where the permit was given, is always an epidemic, and that yellow fever exists at all times in Havana, and is the peculiarly fatal disease of that climate, and is especially dangerous to' strangers and to persons from the Northern States visiting Havana.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-8\">All these offers were objected to by the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-9\">The evidence was excluded and defendant excepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-10\">i entertain no doubt as to the correctness of this tuI<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>ing. The permit was in writing, as required \"by the policy, and it was issued in modification of the policy, or as a waiver of one of its conditions, as contemplated \"by the policy. Being reduced to writing, it must \"be taken to be the repository and evidence of the final intention and understanding of the parties. The rule is elementary that when parties have deliberately put their engagements into writing, in such terms as import a legal obligation, without any uncertainty as to the object or extent of such engagements, it is conclusively presumed that the whole engagement of the parties and the extent and manner of their undertaking was reduced to writing; and all oral testimony of a previous <em>colloquium </em>between the parties, or of conversation or declarations at the time when it ivas completed, or after-wards, is rejected <em>(Greenl. on Ev. </em>\u00a7 275; Norton <em>v. </em>Coons, 2 <em>Seld. </em>33 ; Barry <em>v. </em>Ransom, 2 <em>Kern. </em>462).</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">So firmly established is this rule, that it has frequently been applied and enforced without the citation of authorities in support of it (Thorp <em>v. </em>Ross, 4 Keyes, 546 ; O\u2019Beirne <em>v. </em>Lloyd, 1 Sweeny, 19 ; Milton <em>v. </em>Hudson River Steamboat Co., 4 <em>Lansing, </em>76 ; Delamater <em>v. </em>Bush, <em>63 Barb. </em>168).</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">As the books abound in cases of the application of this rule, a few appropriate examples will be amply sufficient here.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-7\">Lamott <em>v. </em>The Hudson River Fire Ins. Co. (referred to in a note to 17 <em>N. Y. </em>199) was an action upon a fire policy which prohibited the use of camphene on the premises insured, except upon permission, in writing, to be endorsed upon the policy, with a charge for an extra premium therefor. The amount of premium endorsed upon the policy exceeded the regular premium upon such risks as appeared to be covered by the policy by sufficient to cover the price for the use of camphene. It was held, nevertheless, that, as the endorsement did not state that the amount of premium noted was for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>privilege of using camphene, and as it did not appear in some other manner in writing that such privilege had \"been secured to him, the assured was not protected, and parol evidence could not be received to vary the terms of the policy, or to show a waiver of the prohibition at the time of the execution of the instrument.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">Howell <em>v. </em>The Knickerbocker Life Ins. Co. (19 <em>Abb. </em>217) was an action brought by the widow of George H. Howell to recover on a policy effected by her upon the life of her deceased husband, for one year, with the privilege of annual renewal for life, if, on the 15th day of July in each year, the premium was paid. On July 15th, 1864, the annual premium was not paid. On the same day Mr. Howell was seized with apoplexy, and on the following day he died. Some days thereafter the premium was tendered to the company, and refused by the latter. The court held that the stipulated payment was a condition precedent to the continuance of the policy, and that parol evidence of a usage or agreement on the part of the company at the time the insurance was effected, to receive payment of premiums after the day named, could not be received.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">In the case of the Mayor, etc., of the City of Hew York against The Brooklyn Fire Insurance Company (41 <em>Barb. </em>231), it was determined that the evidence offered by the defendant of the verbal statements of the agent of the plaintiffs, who effected the insurance, in respect to the future use and occupation of the building was properly excluded, because such evidence would tend to vary the operation and effect of the language contained in the policy, and because a warranty as to such future use and occupation must be contained in the policy, or be reduced to writing in proper form, before it can be admitted to affect its. construction or obligation.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-7\">In Thompson v. Hall (45 <em>Barb., </em>214), the defendant, Hall, had signed the note in suit as surety for the defendant Thompson, with the knowledge and at the re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>quest of the plaintiff, who was the mother of the principal debtor. On the trial Hall offered to prove that he signed only on condition, which was assented to by the plaintiff, that upon the maturity of the note plaintiff would collect it promptly, and that plaintiff had failed so to do. The evidence was excluded and the General Term affirmed the ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">How, it is undoubtedly true that the permit in question was issued without a new consideration. The company was not bound to give it. But, having given it, it is bound by it, because it springs out of and is based upon the consideration and terms of the policy. Consequently, whether the said permit be regarded as a modification of the original contract of insurance, or as a waiver of certain of the conditions of the policy, the rule which holds parol contemporaneous evidence inadmissible to change its legal effect, is equally applicable. This has been substantially determined in Buckley <em>v. </em>Bentley (48 <em>Barb. </em>283). In that case the endorser of a note had. subsequently written over his signature the words \u201c notice of protest waived by me.\u201d On the trial evidence was admitted to show that the verbal arrangement between the parties, which resulted in the entry of those words on the note by the defendant, was, that demand of payment, as well as of notice, was waived. On appeal this was held error, for which the judgment was reversed and a new trial ordered. The court held, that although the arrangement then made was not a contract, because there was no consideration, and had to operate, if at all, by way of estoppel <em>in pais, </em>still the question was, what was the arrangement <em>% </em>and as the parties undertook to put it in writing, they were to be deemed to have given thereby full expression to their meaning, and hence parol evidence of their language, contradicting, varying, or adding to that which was contained in the written instrument, was inadmissible. \u201cThat there was no consideration for the agreement,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>says Pabkeb, J., in delivering the opinion of the court, \u201c cannot change the rule of evidence in regard to what shall be competent proof of what the agreement was. It is a rule of evidence applicable to the mode of proving a fact, and whether that fact is a contract or a waiver, can make no difference with reference to its applicability.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">It is also true, that the rule referred to is directed only against the admission of any other evidence of the <em>language </em>employed by the parties in making the agreement than that which is furnished by the writing itself, and that the writing may be read by the light of surrounding circumstances. But this is permitted only for the purpose of finding out the true sense of the written words as the parties used them. It is for this reason that, whenever the necessity arises, the rule does not exclude the testimony of experts to aid the court in reading the instrument.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">Unless, therefore, the terms of a written instrument have generally, in respect to the subject-matter, as, by the known usage of trade or the like, acquired a peculiar sense, distinct from the popular sense of the same words, or unless the context points out that, in the particular instance, and in order to effectuate the immediate intention of the parties, they should be understood in a peculiar sense, they are to be understood in their plain, ordinary, and popular sense <em>(Greenl. on Ev., </em>\u00a7 278). It is not allowable to interpret what has no need of interpretation (Bro<em>om's Leg. </em>Max.), and parol evidence should never be allowed to create an ambiguity where none exists (Auburn City Bank <em>v. </em>Leonard, 40 <em>Barb. </em>119.)</p>\n<p id=\"b260-8\">The word \u201c epidemics,\u201d in the permit, is not shown to have been used in the peculiarly medical sense attributed to it by the learned counsel for the company ; nor was it used in a sense peculiar to the business of life insurance. On the contrary, it is plainly to be seen that it was used and understood in its plain, ordinary, and popular sense as a familiar word in our language. Ho <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>evidence of any kind from any other source was, therefore, admissible to change that meaning (Baptist Church in Brooklyn <em>v. </em>Brooklyn Fire Ins. Co., <em>28 </em>N. <em>Y. </em>153 ; Neff <em>v. </em>Friedman, <em>2 Sweeny, </em>607).</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">The company evidently did not intend to stipulate solely against diseases which usually assume an epidemic character. It meant to stipulate, and did stipulate, for exemption from liability in case of death, from <em>any </em>disease, however simple and harmless, under ordinary circumstances, at home, that might, by any possibility, prevail in Cuba to an extent which could be called epidemic.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">The requirement of the permit, that Pohalski should return from Cuba before the first day of April following its date, at which time the sickly season usually commences there, is not without significance upon this point. This interpretation, which, upon the whole, is the one most favorable to the company, excludes, however, the idea that plaintiff assumed the risk of her husband\u2019s death from yellow fever when not prevailing to an epidemic extent.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-7\">The evidence offered by defendant, to vary or explain the ordinary and popular meaning of the language of the permit, was, therefore, properly excluded; and when it is finally considered that the attempt to give such evidence was, in fact, an attempt to vary such meaning, by the alleged assent of one now deceased, who was not shown to have had any authority whatever from the plaintiff to make terms or stipulations for her, plaintiff\u2019s case becomes still stronger in reason, though perhaps not in law.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-8\">The judgment should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-9\">Curtis and Van Vorst, JJ., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-10\">Note.\u2014Unanimously affirmed by Court of Appeals, April 7, 1874, 'without a written opinion, the Court resting its decision upon the foregoing opinion of Judge Fbbedmait.\u2014Repobtebs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
