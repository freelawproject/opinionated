And that thereafter, upon due notice to the defendant to appear herein and account, etc., an order was entered authorizing the putting in of the pleadings herein.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b346-9\">The relief demanded was a sale of -the premises, etc.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b346-10\">The defendant demurred, alleging that there were not sufficient facts stated to constitue a cause of action.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b346-11\">The defendant had judgment, sustaining the demurrer, from which the plaintiff appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b346-12\"><em>J.

The allegation that the lien was filed \u201c <em>in accordance with the </em>statute, etc., <em>and in conformity with the </em>statute, is equivalent to saying that all the requirements of the statute had been complied with ; in other words, that the notice of lien was <em>duly verified </em>at the time of filing (23 <em>Barb. </em>305; 2 <em>Abb. </em>422 ; 3 <em>Edw. Ch. R. </em>570; 2 <em>Kerr, </em>433 ; 10 <em>Abb. </em>102; <em>Code, </em>162; 1 <em>Chit. R. </em>245).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b347-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>No complaint is required by the act; it calls merely for the filing of a <em>statement of the claim or demand.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b347-5\">The defendant was informed* of the lien by the notice to foreclose.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b347-6\">If she had any objections to raise as to the validity of the lien, she should have done so then, for after the statement is filed her objections could only go to the demand as <em>stated.</em></summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b347-7\"><em>Marcus J. </em>Waldheimer, attorney, and <em>M. L. Townsend, </em>of counsel for respondent, urged:</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b347-8\">First.\u2014The complaint does not show that the notice which the plaintiff alleges he filed in the office of the clerk of the city and county of New York, on the 24th December, 1872, contained any of the particulars required by Section 6 of the act.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b347-9\">A complaint is demurrable which does not show that the notice filed contained these particulars (Hallagan <em>v. </em>Herbert, 2 Daly, 253; Duffy <em>v. </em>McManus, 3 <em>E. D. </em>Smith, 657).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b347-10\">The averment in the complaint, that the plaintiff on a day named filed\u00a3 \u00a3 a notice in conformity with such statute to create a lien, and whereby there was created in favor of the plaintiff a lien on said building and premises,\u201d is not an averment of facts, but a conculsion of law, especially as no statute is referred to in conformity with which it is alleged the notice was filed.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b347-11\">By the Court.\u2014Monell J.</author>\n<p id=\"A-7\">The creation of a lien upon real estate on behalf of a -mechanic, for labor done or materials furnished upon a building, furnishes a cumulative remedy for the collection of his demand. It does not supersede or interfere with the common-law remedy against the employer (Pollock <em>v. </em>Ehle, 2 <em>E. D. </em>Smith, 541).</p>\n<p id=\"b347-12\">But as a remedy provided by statute, it is requisite that the provisions of the statute should be strictly com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>plied with (Beals v. Congregation B\u2019nai Jeshumn, 1 <em>E. D. Smith, </em>654). Hence the notice creating the lien must contain all the matter specified in the statute. Any omission in that regard would be fatal to the lien.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">The question in this case, however, is as to the sufficiency of the pleading to foreclose the lien.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">The complaint, after stating the performance of the work, alleges that \u201ca notice in conformity with such statute to create, and whereby there was created a lien \u201d in the plaintiff\u2019s favor, was \u201cfiled in the office of the clerk,\u201d etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-7\">It does not appear, from the averment in the complaint, whether the notice was such an one as fully meets the requirements of the statute. The pleader has characterized it as a notice \u201cin conformity with the statute,\u201d and a notice \u201cto create and whereby there was created a lien,\u201d etc. But it cannot be seen from this averment that it is such a notice. The statute directs that the notice shall specify several things, and without them the notice would be nugatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-8\">The proceeding to foreclose the lien is by action, and the rules of pleading applicable to other actions of a similar nature are applicable to pleadings in this proceeding (Doughty <em>v. </em>Devlin, 1 <em>E. D. Smith, </em>625).</p>\n<p id=\"b348-9\">In actions founded upon a cause of action given by a statute, it is not sufficient to merely refer to the statute, unless it is so provided in the statute; but all the facts ' which under the statute constitute the cause of action, must be alleged (Schroeppell <em>v. </em>Corning, 2 <em>N. Y. R. </em>132).</p>\n<p id=\"b348-10\">It was not, therefore, sufficient in this case to merely allege that the notice conformed to the statute. The notice itself should have been set out, or its contents so stated that the court could have seen that the statute had been complied with.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-11\">This question has been directly adjudicated in the Common Pleas (Hallagan <em>v. </em>Herbert, 2 <em>Daly, </em>253).</p>\n<p id=\"b348-12\">The appellant\u2019s counsel claimed that great weight and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>significance should he given to the allegation of <em>\u201cdue\u201d </em>notice. But that is a mere conclusion of law, and not a statement of a fact (Myers <em>v. </em>Machado, 6 <em>Abb. </em>198 ; S. C. 6 <em>Duer, </em>678).</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">The judgment appealed from should he affirmed. Curtis, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
