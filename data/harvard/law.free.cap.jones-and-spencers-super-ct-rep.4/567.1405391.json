An appeal was taken to the General Term, which resulted in an affirmance of the judgment, and a judgment for defendant for \u00a777.49, costs of appeal.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b576-6\">The complaint in this action set forth the above matters and claimed-to recover the said two sums of \u00a7159.61 and \u00a777.49.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b576-7\">The defendant demurred to so much of the complaint as sought to charge him with the costs of appeal on the ground that it appeared that the complaint did not state a cause of action against him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b576-8\">At Special Term the demurrer was overruled, and an order was thereupon entered ordering that the demurrer be overruled, and that plaintiff have judgment thereon, but giving defendant leave to answer on payment of costs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b576-9\">From this order defendant appealed to the General Term.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b576-10\"><em>Jacob A. Gross, </em>attorney and of counsel for appellant, urged:</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b576-11\">I.\u2014The condition of the bond of defendant is \u201c To pay on demand all costs that might be <em>awarded to the defendants in said suit.\u201d</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b576-12\">This does not include costs of appeal to the General Term.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b576-13\">1. The suit is at an end on entry of judgment, which is \u201c the final determination of the rights of the parties to the action\u201d <em>(Code, </em>\u00a7 245; <em>Bouvier's Law Dict. </em>12 ed., vol. 1. p. 78 ; 3 <em>Sharswood\u2019s Blaclcstone's Comm. </em>116).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b576-14\">2. The designation of the parties as plaintiff and de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>fendant (\u00a7 70) ends with the judgment. On appeal they are to be designated as <em>appellant </em>and <em>respondent </em>respectively (Id.<em> \u00a7 </em>326).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b577-4\">3. -The Code itself not only regulates the security to be given on the appeal, but prescribes the only penalties for neglect; the proceedings are not stayed (\u00a7 348).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b577-5\">4. The bond in question is expressly and only for the costs in the suit, and therefore differs from most others referred to in decided cases, which provide for full indemnity to the party injured (Bennet <em>v. </em>Brown, 31 <em>Barb. </em>158, 162, and cases cited).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b577-6\">II.\u2014The decision at Special Term extends the undertaking of the surety beyond its terms, and violates the well established principles to the contrary effect (Rayner v.

It is held that the bond cannot be prosecuted until the appeal is decided (Van Vleck <em>v. </em>Clark, 38 <em>Barb. </em>31 ; 24 <em>How. Pr. </em>190 ; Tibbles <em>v. </em>O\u2019Conner, 28 <em>Barb. </em>538).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b577-9\">Besides, the language of the bond in suit covers \u201c all costs that might be awarded to the defendants in said action.\u201d</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b577-10\"><em>Per </em>curiam.</author>\n<p id=\"AYG\">The order below should be affirmed.
