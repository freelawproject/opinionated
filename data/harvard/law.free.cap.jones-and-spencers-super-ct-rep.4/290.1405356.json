ALLEN, Administratrix, Plaintiff and Respondent, <em>v. </em>WILLIAM G. WARD, Defendant and Appellant.</parties>\n<p data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b298-7\">Before Monell, Curtis, and Sedgwick, JJ.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b298-8\"><em>Decided November </em>29, 1873.</decisiondate>\n<headnotes data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b298-5\">Bankruptcy Proceedings against Cobpobation.\u2014Effect of, on Liability of its Stockholders.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b298-6\">1. <em>An adjudication </em>in an mvoluutaiy bankruptcy proceeding against a. corporation, adjudging the corporation a bankrupt, and appointing an assignee of its effects, <em>does not affect </em>the enforcement of the claim of <em>a creditor of the corporation against its stockholders,</em></headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"Atn\"><em>a. </em>Notwithstanding such adjudication and appointment, the creditors of the corporation may recover against the stockholders. \u25a0</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"AbR\">1. This, although the creditor may have proved his debt against the bankrupt estate, and filed his claim with the assignee.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b298-9\">Appeal from judgment and order.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b298-10\">This action was against the defendant as a stockholder of an express company, to recover the value of property sold and delivered to the company.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b298-11\">An action for the recovery of the demand was commenced against the company, and a judgment obtained upon which an execution had been issued and returned unsatisfied.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b298-12\">The defence to this action was, that the company had been adjudged a bankrupt, and an assignee of its effects appointed, and that the plaintiff had proved her debt against the bankrupt estate, and filed her claim with the assignee.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b298-13\">At the trial an offer to prove the facts constituting the defence was excluded, and the defendant excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b298-14\">The court directed a verdict for the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b298-15\">The defendant appealed. \u25a0</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b299-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number><em>Elihu </em>Root, attorney, and of counsel for appellant, urged:</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b299-5\"><em>First. </em>The proof in bankruptcy, evidence of which the court excluded, was a voluntary waiver and extinction of the right of action against the corporation upon which the plaintiff\u2019s claim against this defendant is founded <em>(The United States Bankruptcy Act of </em>1867, \u00a7 xxi ; Marbury v. Madison, 1 <em>Cranch. </em>137-180 ; <em>In re </em>Rosenberg, 2 <em>B. R. </em>82).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b299-6\"><em>Second. </em>Independently of the express provision of section 21, the plaintiff\u2019s proof of her claim in the bankruptcy proceeding is a bar to this action so long as the state of things shown on the trial continues to exist.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b299-7\">The bankruptcy proceeding is in its nature and effect identical with the proceedings in equity against an insolvent corporation provided for by our Revised Statutes.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b299-8\">When such a proceeding was commenced, not only could all suits at law against the corporation and stockholders be stayed, but creditors becoming parties to such proceedings were <em>ipso facto </em>prevented from proceeding at law (2 <em>R. S. </em>466 ; Hutchinson <em>v. </em>N. Y. C. Mills, 2 Abb. 401).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b299-9\">The statutory provision requiring judgment and return of execution unsatisfied against the corporation, before suit against the stockholder, was intended by the legislature as a safeguard to the stockholder' (Corning v. McCullough, 1 <em>Comst. </em>47-67).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b299-10\">It was to secure the exhaustion of the remedy against the corporation before the stockholder should be called upon to respond.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b299-11\">If this plaintiff had united in the proceeding under the Revised Statutes, to reach the unpaid balances of stock subscriptions which constitute a trust fund for the payment of creditors (Mann <em>v. </em>Pentz, 3 <em>N. Y. </em>416), it would be that remedy which she must show to be exhausted.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b300-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number><em>Eaton, Tailer &amp; Cadwalader, </em>attorneys, and <em>J. L. Cadwalader, </em>of counsel for respondent, urged :</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b300-5\">(1.) A creditor <em>of an individual </em>does not, by proving Ms claim, extinguish his right of action, but waives his remedies so far as they are inconsistent with the act <em>(Bump\u2019s Bankruptcy, </em>6th ed. p. 437; Hoyt v. Freel, 8 <em>Abb. Pr. N. S. </em>220).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b300-6\">A collateral remedy not directed at the debtor could always be enforced.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b300-7\">(2.) The Bankrupt Law, section 37, provides that no corporation, and no member, etc., of any such, shall be discharged. To allow this defendant to defend on this ground is a violation of the statute <em>(Bump\u2019s Bankruptcy, </em>6th ed. pp. 437, 438; Allen v. Soldiers, etc., Co., 4 <em>B. R. </em>176; Meyer <em>v. </em>Aurora Ins. Co., 7 <em>B. R. </em>191).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b300-8\">The whole question was passed on when this corporation moved for a stay on this very judgment obtained against it in the Supreme Court (see Allen v. Soldiers, etc., Co., <em>supra).</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b300-9\">(3.) Section 21 of the act, providing all suits, etc., shall be stayed, has no reference to corporations, and the only remedy of the defendant was a stay on the original cause of action, which was attempted and failed. When no discharge could be granted, no stay 'would be granted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b300-10\">So much of section 31 as prescribes a penalty for proving a debt applies only to a debt which may be discharged.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b300-11\">A debt against a corporation or one contracted by fraud cannot be affected <em>(In re </em>Robinson, 6 <em>Blatch. </em>253 ; <em>In re </em>Rosenberg, 2 <em>B. R. </em>81; <em>In re </em>Wright, 36 <em>How. Pr. R. </em>167 ; <em>In re </em>Migel, 2 <em>B. R. </em>153).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b300-12\">(4.) Besides the condition precedent, on the happening of which, by the terms of the act, the defendant became liable, had arisen. <em>The defendant became liable, </em>bank<em>ruptcy or no bankruptcy, whenever a judgment had </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number><em>been </em>obtained, <em>and an execution upon it returned unsatisfied.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b301-5\">As shown above, a stay was attempted and failed, and the judgment and execution now stand unquestioned. Whether this corporation is bankrupt or not\u2014solvent or insolyent, will make no difference\u2014when the judgment is recovered and the execution returned, the act, by its terms, makes the defendant liable.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b301-6\">By the Court.\u2014Monell, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AkY\">The provision of the Bankrupt Law (\u00a721), which declares that no creditor proving his claim shall be allowed to maintain any suit therefor) at law or in equity, against the bankrupt, cannot have any broader effect than is warranted by the letter of the statute. It does not inhibit other or collateral remedies. The right of action, therefore, against the defendant, arising upon his liability as a stockholder, is not affected by the Bankrupt Law.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-7\">Another reason for excluding the defence is that the suspension of the right to prosecute the bankrupt is only until the question of his discharge shall have been determined. ^</p>\n<p id=\"b301-8\">Now, as it is expressly provided that no discharge shall be granted to a corporation, or to any person, officer, or member thereof (\u00a7 37), the inhibition contained in the previous section would probably be inoperative.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-9\">There was no error in excluding the evidence offered.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-10\">The judgment and order should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-11\">Curtis and Sedgwick, JJ., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
