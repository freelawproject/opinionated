Evidence was given on both <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>sides as to the cause of the falling, the manner of piling the staves, the custom as to piling and taking down the piles, and as to the acts of the plaintiff on the occasion of his receiving his injury.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b341-5\">Plaintiff testified among other things in substance that before the inj ury he had been earning $4.50 a day and was pretty constantly at work ; that by reason of the injury he was confined to his bed and sofa for eight weeks and to the house about three months, and was attended by a physician; and that since the injury he had been unable to work as well as usual.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b341-6\">The doctor who attended the plaintiff testified that plaintiff\u2019s ankle joint was badly dislocated and the small bones of the leg badly fractured, and that the amount of his bill for attending on plaintiff was $500, which had not been paid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b341-7\">The case was submitted to the jury under the following charge.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b341-8\">\u201c Gentlemen, this a very simple case. The first \u201cquestion for you to pass upon is whether the defendants in this action have committed negligence. If \u201cthey have not, then you can stop there, and find a \u201cverdict for the defendants. If, however, you find that \u201cthe defendants have committed negligence in throwing \u201c down this pile, it will be then necessary for you to consider whether the plaintiff contributed to the injury \u201cby running across the pile at the time it was falling. \u201cIf you find that he is guilty of negligence contributing to the injury, you will still render a verdict for \u2018' the defendants. If, however, you find for the plain\u201ctiff on both these questions, then you will have <em>to </em>\u201c ascertain the amount of damages he has sustained.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b341-9\">\u201cYou have heard the testimony, and it is for you to \u201c say whether the plaintiff is to be believed, or whether \u201cthe witnesses produced on the part of the defendants \u201care to be believed, who testified that the pile was \u201cthrown down in the ordinary way, and that notice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>\u201cwas given to the plaintiff. Numerous witnesses have \u201cbeen produced on the part of the defendants : first, \u201cthe foreman, who is clear and distinct in his state- \u201c ment that he told the plaintiff he was about to toss the \u201c pile of staves, and desired him to go away; the other \u201cwitnesses corroborate the foreman in respect to the \u201c warning. It is for you to say on all the testimony, \u201cfirst, whether there was any negligence on the part of \u201cthe defendants; if so, whether there was any negli-'\u2018 gence on the part of the plaintiff contributing to the \u201cinjury ; and if you find that the defendants were \u201cguilty of negligence, and that there was no negli- \u201c gence on the part of the plaintiff, then you will ascertain what damages should be awarded to him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b342-5\">\u201cThe doctor has stated that his bill for services was \u201c$500. The character of the injury has been stated to \u2018 \u2018 you, and it is for you to say how much he is entitled \u201c to receive. \u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b342-6\">The jury rendered a verdict for plaintiff, and assessed the damages at $125.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b342-7\">The plaintiff moved at Special Term on a case, and exceptions for a new trial on th\u00e9 ground among others of the insufficiency of damages.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b342-8\">The motion was granted, and this appeal is by the defendant from the order granting the motion.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b342-9\">Ho judgment has been entered.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b342-10\"><em>Glassey, Thomas, </em>and <em>Davenport, </em>attorneys, and <em>Samuel J. Glassey, </em>of counsel for appellants, urged:</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b342-11\">I. In actions for damages, courts will not disturb a verdict merely because the amount is greater or less than they might deem the proper amount (Winchell <em>v. </em>Latham, 6 <em>Cow. </em>682 ; Fleming <em>v. </em>Hallenbeck, 7 <em>Barb. </em>271, etc.).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b342-12\"><em>a. </em>There was no proof of any specific damage sustained by the plaintiff. The doctor states what he charged for his services, but there is no evidence of how <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>many visits he made or what was their value. There was a total failure of proof on this subject. \u2022</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b343-5\"><em>b. </em>Plaintiff had to take a <em>corporation job </em>by reason of the accident, but whether at an increase or diminution of wages he does not say.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b343-6\">II. In actions founded on tort, courts do hot grant new trials merely because the verdict is against the weight of evidence, unless some rule of law has been violated (Jarvis <em>v. </em>Hathaway, 3 <em>John. </em>180; Murphy <em>v. </em>People, <em>2 Cow. </em>815; Wheeler <em>v. </em>Calkins, 17 <em>How. </em>451, and cases therein quoted).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b343-7\"><em>a. </em>The justice at Special Term has assumed in this case that the amount of the verdict was grossly inadequate and contrary to the evidence, and grants a new trial; and cites 40 <em>New </em>York, 551, and 7 <em>Bosw. </em>1; which cases do not sustain the decision below. Nor does the case of Richards <em>r. </em>Sandford (2 <em>E. D. </em>Smith, 349), which was a case of injury to plaintiff, and the jury assessed the damages at $10, for loss of a tooth, injury to the face, etc.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b343-8\">The court granted a new trial upon condition that all costs are paid, but denied the motion itself if defendant would stipulate to increase the amount to $100.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b343-9\">III. If this had been a proper case to order a new trial, it must be on condition that the moving party pay all the costs incurred.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b343-10\"><em>No part of the judge's charge </em>was disregarded by the jury. <em>He could not </em>and did not tell them the amount they should find. If he had, it would .have been error on his part:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b343-11\">Where plaintiff or defendant ask for a new trial, because the jury\u2019s verdict is against evidence, it must be on payment of costs (Bank of Utica v. Ives, 17 Wendell, 501; Conrad <em>v. </em>Williams, 6 <em>Hill. </em>444 ; Kennedy <em>v. </em>Harlem R. R., 3 <em>Duer, </em>659 ; Simmons <em>v. </em>Fay, <em>1 E. D. Smith, </em>114; Brock <em>v. </em>Barnes, 40 <em>Barb. </em>521; Overing <em>r. </em>Rus<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>sell, 28 Howard, 151; Jackson v. Thurston, 3 <em>Cow. </em>342; Goodyear v. Ogden, 4 <em>Hill, </em>106; Brown <em>v. </em>Bradshaw, 1 <em>Duer, </em>199 ; Ward v. Woodburn, 27 <em>Barb. </em>346.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b344-5\"><em>a. </em>The case of Robbins v. Hudson R. R. R. (7 <em>Bosw. </em>1), quoted by Justice Freedman, is not in point. There the jury rode over the justice\u2019s charge, and, in defiance of his instructions, refused to assess the damages, and the case is clearly distinguishable from the present one. So, too, the question as to whether the costs should abide the \"event of the final decision, or be paid as a condition of granting a new trial, was not raised by either side.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b344-6\"><em>Thomas </em>Bgan, attorney, and <em>Christopher Fine, </em>of counsel for respondent, urged</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b344-7\">First.\u2014The new trial was properly ordered (McDonald <em>v. </em>Walter, 40 <em>N. Y. </em>551, 552, 554; Richard v. Santford, 2 <em>E. D. Smith, </em>349).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b344-8\">Second.\u2014The costs should and were properly made to abide the event (Rollins v. Harlem R. R. Co., 7 <em>Bosw. </em>15).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b344-9\">In a case where the verdict is contrary to the law and to the charge of the judge, the costs will be directed to abide the event (Van Rensellear v. Dale, 1 <em>John. Cases, </em>279; Knapp v. Curtis, 9 <em>Wend. </em>60; <em>Gra. Prac. </em>635 [2d. ed.]; Jacobson v. Belmont, 7 <em>Bosw. </em>14, 18 ; La Farge v. Kneeland, 7 <em>Cowen, </em>456, 461, and cases above cited).</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b344-10\">By the Court.\u2014Sedgwick, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AG5\">In this case, there was a verdict for plaintiff for $125. The evidence in the case makes it manifest that if he was entitled to a verdict at all, he was actually damaged in a much greater sum. On his motion a new trial was granted on the ground that the verdict was against the evidence and contrary to the charge of the judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-11\">The first objection taken on this appeal is that the case shows that the plaintiff was not entitled to any ver<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>diet at all. This is not well founded, if we could consider such an objection. There was evidence that the defendant was negligent, and also that the plaintiff was not guilty of negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">The other objection is that the new trial should have been granted upon the defendants paying costs. This is not so, if the verdict was against the judge\u2019s charge. For then the plaintiff was not in fault in not seeing that the jury was properly instructed (Robbins v. Hudson R. R. R. Co., 7 <em>Bosw. </em>1). In this case, the jury, instead of looking to the evidence, as they were instructed to do by the court, to ascertain the damages, disregarded that instruction, and gave a .verdict at variance with the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">The order appealed from is affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-7\">Monell and Curtis, JJ., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
