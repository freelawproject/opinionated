The doctrine of <em>caveat emptor </em>demands that a tenant hiring a portion of a manufacturing establishment shall, at his peril, ascertain the established method of using the building and the physical conditions resulting therefrom, to the same extent that it does in respect to the permitted and unarfested action of the elements upon the premises and the injuries that may result therefrom.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b402-9\">1st. Under a contract for hiring, there is no implied covenant that the premises are tenantable, the common law imposing upon the tenant the duty of ascertaining that the same are suitable for his occupation and use (O\u2019Brien <em>v. </em>Capwell, 59 <em>Barb. </em>497; Cleves <em>v. </em>Willoughby, 7 <em>Hill, </em>83; McGlashan <em>v. </em>Tallmadge, 37 <em>Barb. </em>313; Howard <em>v. </em>Doolittle, 3 Duer, 464; Izon <em>v. </em>Groton, 5 <em>Bing., N.

Civil </em>Code, \u00a7 990 and note).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b402-10\">2d. If this proposition were not true, then the converse must be true, for there is no middle course, that the rule in letting is <em>caveat venditor. </em>This would make the landlord a warrantor and insurer of the premises, and the statement of it bears its own refutation.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b402-11\">The true rule is thus laid down in a case in our own State:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b402-12\">\u201cA man may make a proper use of his own, and others must take notice of his right to do so \u201d (Hay <em>v. </em>Cohoes Co., 3 <em>Barb. </em>50).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b403-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>And the only exception that there seems to be to the rule is the case of a furnished house or furnished apartments (Smith <em>v. </em>Marrable, 11 <em>M. &amp; W. </em>5).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b403-4\">This exception seems to be based upon the doctrine of <em>latent </em>defects, according to the argument of counsel and the observations of one of the barons in a later case (Sutton <em>v. </em>Temple, 12 <em>M. &amp; W. 52).</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b403-5\"><em>3d. </em>The court, in charging the jury, declared that the defendants\u2019 liability for the oil was the same as if the landlord suffered the roof to leak, and the water, percolating downward, carried with it the iron complained of to the plaintiff\u2019s damage. To this proposition we assent, but say that in neither case could the landlord be held liable.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b403-6\">Nor is there any distinction in principle or in decisions between effects resulting from natural causes or those produced by artificial causes (Westlake <em>v. </em>De Graw, <em>25 Wend. </em>669 ; Sutton <em>v. </em>Temple, 12 <em>M. &amp; W. </em>52; Foster <em>v. </em>Peyser, 63 <em>Mass. 242; </em>Dutton <em>v. </em>Grerrish, 63 <em>Mass. </em>89 ; Welles <em>v. </em>Castles, 3 <em>Gray, </em>324).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b403-7\">The doctrine of <em>contributive negligence, </em>which is in this case synonymous with <em>caveat </em>erwptor, is equally fatal to the plaintiff\u2019s claim.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b403-8\">That the party injured must not, by his own negligence, have contributed to the injury, must be considered a legal postulate (Johnson <em>v. </em>Hudson River R. R. 20 <em>N. Y. </em>69).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b403-9\">II. As, according to plaintiffs\u2019 testimony, the iron was the sole cause of the injury complained of, and the defendants had established the use of the building prior to the tenancy of First &amp; Pryibil, who, with full knowledge of the dripping of the oil, so placed, their iron that thereby alone the iron particles were conveyed into plaintiff\u2019s mills, the defendants were the remote and not the proximate cause of the damage, and consequently was not liable therefor.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b403-10\">1st. The cases all agree in this proposition, that neg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>ligence must Tbe <em>proximate </em>and not <em>remote </em>(Austin <em>v. </em>New Jersey Stbt.

An injury is considered immediate when the act complained of <em>itself, </em>and not merely the consequences of that act, occasions the injury (1 <em>Chitty's Pleading, </em>117; Approved Scott <em>v. </em>Bay, 3 <em>Maryland, </em>443 ; Panton <em>v. </em>Norton, 18 <em>Hill, </em>500; Ryan v.

Under any circumstances the judgment should be reversed for the erroneous instruction given to the jury by the court, that they might give to plaintiff compensation for damage done to the good-will of plaintiff\u2019 s business.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b404-6\">1st. The Court of Appeals in this State have of late held that there are no degrees in neglignce in harmony with English and national decisions (Filer <em>v. </em>N. Y. C. R. R. 49 <em>N.

S. </em>474; 14 <em>U. S. </em>483.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b404-7\">Recently the judges of several English courts have expressed their disapprobation of attempts to fix the degrees of diligence by legal definitions, and have complained of the impracticability of applying them (Wylde <em>v. </em>Pickford, 8 <em>Meeson </em>c\u00a7 <em>West, </em>443, 461, 462; Hinton <em>v. </em>Dibbon, 22 <em>B. </em>646, 651). It must be confessed that the difficulty in defining gross negligence, which is apparent in such cases as Tracy v. Wood (3 <em>Mason, </em>132), Foster <em>v. </em>Essex Bank (17 <em>Mass. </em>479), would be sufficient to justify these complaints. It may be added that some of the ablest commentators on the Roman Law and on the Civil Code of France have wholly re-' pudiated this theory of three degrees of diligence as unfounded in principles of natural justice, useless in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>practice, and presenting inextricable embarrassments and difficulties <em>(Toulliers Droit Civil, </em>Vol. 6, p. 239, 11 Vol. p. 203; <em>Makeldey Man. Du Droit Domain, </em>191).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b405-4\">In Hurton <em>v. </em>Dibbin, Lord Denman said: \u201cIt may well be doubted whether between gross negligence or negligence merely any intelligible distinction exists.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b405-5\">Under these decisions, the Court erred in charging the jury that great and continuous negligence was equivalent to gross negligence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b405-6\">2d. If there were such negligence, it did not alter the rule xof damages, and damage to the good-will is too remote to be considered.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b405-7\">Thus, where an act caused such injury that plaintiffs were forced \"to make an assignment, it was held that' that was not the legitimate consequence of such act (Donnell <em>v. </em>Jones, 13 <em>Ala. </em>490).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b405-8\">Where a telegraph company neglected to send a despatch, commissions on sales that would otherwise have been effected, were1 held to be too remote damages (Landsberger <em>v. </em>Telegraph Co., 32 <em>Barb. </em>530).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b405-9\">Where customers refused to purchase anything from plaintiffs\u2019 establishment, in consequence of the bad repute caused by defendants having sold plaintiffs diseased meat, held that such loss was not the legal and natural consequences of the act (Crain <em>v. </em>Petrie, 6 <em>Hill, </em>522.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b405-10\">IY.\u20141st.

It had not the slightest relevancy to the case before the court. It directly appeared that the defendants had settled for the water, and that no claim whatever existed on account thereof.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b405-12\">2d. The evidence about the business of the plaintiffs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>between January and June, 1868, was improperly admitted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b406-4\">It formed no basis whatever for determining the profit of the plaintiffs in 1869, or the damage to the good-will of their business.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b406-5\"><em>W.

The following cases sustain this doctrine : Scott <em>v. </em>Shepherd, <em>2 W. Black, </em>892 (the Squib case); Gruille v.

Such negligence is not a positive element, but it consisted, if it existed, in a mere omission <em>to do </em>something which the law required under the circumstances, or, in other words, in a want of diligence without positive intention to injure the plaintiffs. The law required that in carrying on its operations the defendant should use due diligence to prevent injury to the plaintiffs, that is to say, the defendant was bound to use the same amount of care, caution, attention, and discretion as the ordinary prudent man would put forth under precisely the same circumstances. The plaintiffs were bound to use similar diligence to guard against injury. The want or omission on either side, of such care, caution, attention, or discretion constituted negligence. Thus, the duty of such diligence, etc., etc., and consequently the negligence, was relative on both sides, that is, relative to the actual situation of affairs and the means of knowledge of the parties. These questions, therefore, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>had to he determined upon <em>all </em>the circumstances of the case, of which the relation of landlord and tenant was hut one, and a comparatively unimportant one ; and in determining them it became necessary for the learned judge below, and for the jury, if the case was rightfully sent to them, to place themselves in the position of the persons whose acts had to be judged. The evidence given upon the trial, when considered in the light of these principles, was not of such a character as would have authorized the court to determine the diligence or negligence of either side as matter of law, and consequently the questions relating thereto on both sides had to be submitted to the jury as questions of fact. For this reason defendant\u2019s exception to the refusal of the court to dismiss the complaint is clearly untenable. The case could not be disposed of on the simple theory that as between landlord and \"tenant the landlord is not bound to repair without express covenant.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-4\">A more serious question is presented by the exceptions relating to the reception of certain evidence and to certain portions of the charge that bear upon the question of damages. Evidence had been given that plaintiff\u2019s business extended to the principal cities of the United States, and of the manner in which it was conducted ; that in March or April, 1869, mustard commenced to be returned by plaintiff\u2019s customers on the ground of its bad quality, and that in the course of some further time all the mustard manufactured between the 1st of January and the month of June, 1869, was thus returned ; that on investigation the said mustard was found to be utterly worthless, and that it had to be thrown away ; that thereupon numerous attempts were made by plaintiffs to discover the cause, and that for that purpose and at great expense, the mills were frequently stopped, cleaned up, and thoroughly inspected, and chemical analyses were made of the mustard, and of the materials that entered into its manufac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>ture, and that finally it was discovered that oil impregnated with iron was leaking from defendants\u2019 premises into plaintiffs\u2019mustard mills, and to all appearances had been thus leaking for some time, and that this had worked the injury. Evidence had also been given of the quantity of mustard thus lost, ofits market value in a sound condition, and of the expenses incurred by plaintiffs in discovering the cause of the difficulty and in obviating the injurious effects produced. Then it happened that Julius Wolff, one of the plaintiffs, on being recalled, was allowed to testify against defendant\u2019s objection and exception, that from the first of January to the first of June of the preceding year plaintiffs had about two hundred customers, from whom they realized a profit of not less than one thousand dollars per month, and which subsequently were all lost. This ruling was erroneous for several reasons. The complaint did not allege the names of said customers. It did not even contain an averment of loss of customers as an item of special damage in general terms, bio such loss could therefore be proven (Hallock <em>v. </em>Miller, 2 <em>Barb. </em>630 ; Tobias <em>v. </em>Harland, 4 <em>Wend. </em>537). The evidence already given showed affirmatively that-no damage had occurred prior to 1869, and consequently the testimony objected to related to a period too remote in any aspect of the case ; for the damage complained of not being the result of intention, but of negligence, the law holds the defendant responsible only for such results as spring naturally, <em>i. e., </em>according to the usual course of things, from defendant\u2019s negligent acts, unaffected by extraneous causes. Upon any such result the said testimony had no legitimate bearing, and that it may have prejudiced the defendant becomes apparent when it is considered in connection with the charge. The jury were instructed that in case they found that the negligence of the defendant was not occasional, but general and continuous\u2014in the language of the law, gross\u2014they should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>in addition to the market value of the goods actually-spoiled, and the interest thereon, find from the evidence what damage was done to the business of the plaintiffs, and should also give them compensation for the loss of time and for the trouble that they were put to. Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel requested the court to charge further that if the defendant was guilty of gross or of reckless negligence, it is liable for the injury to the good-will of plaintiffs\u2019 business. This proposition the court submitted to the jury by saying: \u201cI charge you that in effect, except I prefer not to use the words good-will of the business,\u2019 but to say the damage done to the business, as it has been given in evidence before you.\u201d This was equivalent to saying that the jury had a right to consider the testimony objected to in determining the aggregate amount of damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">The error committed in the reception of said testimony cannot, therefore, be disregarded ; and this being so, it is unnecessary to express an opinion on the questions raised by the remaining exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">The judgment appealed from is reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-7\">Barbour, Oh.
