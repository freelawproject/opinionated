It confers a discretion upon the court. The precise words are : \u201cIf any defendant be in actual custody under an order of arrest, and the plaintiff shall neglect to enter judgment in tho action within one-month after it is in his power to do so * * * such defendant, may on his motion be discharged from custody by the court in which such action shall have been commenced, unless good cause to the contrary be shown; and after being so discharged, such defendant shall not be arrested upon any execution issued in such action.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b524-7\">\u201c The primary and most common use of the word \u2018 may \u2019 is the giving permission to perform the act referred to.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"A4x5\">It seems quite clear that the legislature designed, by the second subdivision of the 288th section of the Code, to confer upon every defendant who should be kept in actual custody upon an order of arrest, for more than one month after the plaintiff had power to enter judgment, an absolute right to be discharged from such custody, and exonerated from liability to arrest on execution, unless good cause to the contrary should be shown. The word \u201cmay,\u201d taken in connection with the context, just as clearly exhibits that intention as the.word \u201cshall\u201d would have done. The provision in question, therefore, gives to a prisoner so situated the privilege of asserting and obtaining one of the highest and most important rights of a citizen, the right of personal liberty, \u25a0and is not a mere permission given to the court to grant the release, or, arbitrarily, to withhold it, notwithstanding no \u201cgood cause to the contrary\u201d be shown (see Williams <em>v. </em>The People 24 <em>N. Y. </em>405, and 2 <em>N. Y. </em>556, \u00a7 37). Indeed, the exercise of such arbitrary power would defeat the plain intent and object of the legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-9\">In this case, all the facts required by the act to entitle the prisoner to the relief asked for were established by the moving papers, and no attempt was made by affidavit or otherwise to show any cause why he ought not to be discharged. The motion should therefore have been granted, and it follows that the order appealed from must be reversed, with costs, and an order <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>entered discharging the defendant Griffin from the custody of the sheriff.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">Curtis and Van Vorst, J J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
