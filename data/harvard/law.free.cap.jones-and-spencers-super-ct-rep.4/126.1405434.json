These were its own mines, from which it procured coal by its own miners and laborers, and mines owned by others from whom it made purchases of coal.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b136-5\">The contract was made November 30th, 1870. On the 39th of that month the plaintiffs posted through their own collieries a notice that \u201c on and after the first of \u201cDecember proximo, the prices paid to miners, labor-11 ers, and others, employed by this department, will be \u201cthe same as those paid in April, 1869.\u201d This would have reduced wages from $1.30 a car to 86 cents a car.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b136-6\">As to the effect of this notice, the referee finds \u201c that \u201cin December, 1870, a strike was caused among the \u201c miners in plaintiff\u2019s employ, and plaintiff\u2019s reduction of \u201c the wages of such miners immediately preceded and \u201c was the proximate cause of said strike,\u201d and \u201cthat the \u201c business of the plaintiff was thereby so interrupted \u201c as to materially decrease the quantity of coal which \u201c they would otherwise have been able to obtain and de- \u201c liver; \u201d \u201c that during the continuance of said combina- \u201c tion and strike, the production of coal by the plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number><em>1 \u2018 </em>was wholly suspended: \u201d \u201c that the coal which during \u201cthat time they were able to obtain and deliver at \u201c Elizabethport and Hoboken amounted in all to but a \u201cfew hundred tons, and that their usual and ordinary \u201creceipts at said points, prior to said strike and in the \u2018 \u2018 ordinary course of their business, amounted to about \u201c 9,000 tons daily.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b137-4\">The referee did not find specifically, although the testimony shows that the reduction of wages was not proposed with the purpose of causing a strike or in bad faith to the defendants, but was made in the belief that the reduction would be proper, and would not be objected to by the miners and laborers.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b137-5\">It was assumed that workmen stopping their work in consequence of the plaintiffs giving the notice specified, was a strike.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b137-6\">The referee, as a conclusion of law, found that the plaintiff was not bound to deliver to the defendants, under the contract, the coal which was not delivered.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b137-7\"><em>H. W. </em>Johnston, attorney, and <em>F. C. </em>Cantine, of counsel for appellants, urged:</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b137-8\">1st. The referee erred in his interpretation of the terms of sale, the essential part of which is contained in the tenth article. It is important to observe that this article begins with a stipulation that the plaintiffs will make \u201c every effort for the fulfillment of its contracts for the delivery of coal,\u201d etc.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b137-9\">This stipulation is of the essence of the contract, and, as we shall show, performs a very important office as a guide to the true construction of the whole article.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b137-10\">' If the plaintiffs had performed this stipulation, even in its spirit, they would not have committed the act which produced the \u201cstrike\u201d pleaded by them as a discharge from the contract.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b137-11\">2d. It is not denied that such a \u201cstrike \u201d as the parties contemplated at the time the contract was made, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>would have absolved the plaintiffs from all obligation to deliver the coal in question; but it is insisted that such a \u201cstrike\u201d never occurred.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"pA_U\">The \u201c strike \u201d which the parties had in mind, was one which should be occasioned without the fault or agency of the plaintiffs ; one which they could not prevent or control; one which should arise <em>in spite of </em>\u201cevery effort\u201d which they might make, \u201cfor the fulfillment of its contract.\u201d Plaintiffs had reason to.believe that defendants so understood the contract, and if so, the court will construe it accordingly (2 <em>Story on </em>Contracts, \u00a7 635).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b138-5\">_ 3d. This clause of the article in question must be so interpreted as to give it significance and effect. The construction contended for by the plaintiffs deprives the clause of all meaning.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b138-6\">Validity and force must be given to every part of the contract, so as to make the obligations mutual (Barton <em>v. </em>McLean, 5 <em>Hill, </em>256; 2 <em>Story on Contracts, </em>\u00a7\u00a7 657, 658 ; 2 <em>Parsons on Contracts, </em>pages 16, 17).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b138-7\">Construed on this principle, the article would read as follows: \u201cEvery effort will be made by the Company for the fulfilment of its contracts for the delivery of coal; but if, notwithstanding such efforts, at any time,\u201d etc.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b138-8\">4th. If it is repugnant to, or inconsistent with, the remainder of the article, it must prevail over the other stipulations, for the reason that it is the earlier stipulation (2 <em>Parsons Contr. </em>p. 26, <em>and notes; </em>Newdecker v. Kohlberg, 3 <em>Daly, </em>407).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b138-9\">But there is no repugnancy or inconsistency between the several clauses of the article. They are entirely harmonious.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b138-10\">5th. The construction put upon this article by the referee cannot be sustained, except upon the theory that the defendants entered into the contract with the intention of leaving it to the option of the plaintiffs to perform <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>or not, as their pleasure or interest might dictate ; for, upon this construction, they could, if so disposed, discharge themselves by provoking a strike among their miners.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b139-4\">Such a construction is irreconcilable with the presumption that contracting parties intend, in the absence of plain expressions to the contrary, to bind each other by mutual obligations, and is incompatible with the rule of construction that the court will, if possible, so interpret contracts as to make them mutual. It makes the contract in question essentially unilateral.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b139-5\">6th. If the plaintiffs had intended to make the performance of the contract on their part dependent on the existence of <em>any </em>strike, whether caused by their instrumentality or otherwise, they were bound to express that intention clearly. Having failed to do so, the maxim \u2018\u2018contraproferentem\u2019\u2019 applies <em>(2 Story on </em>Contracts, \u00a7 662 ; 2 <em>Parsons Contr. </em>19 ; Edsall <em>v. </em>C. <em>&amp; </em>A. R. R. Co., Church, C. J., Court of Appeals, <em>Albany Law </em>Journal, April 26th, 1873; Alexander <em>v. </em>Green, 7 <em>Hill, </em>533; Wells <em>v. </em>Steam Nav. Co., 8 <em>N.

R. Co., 47 <em>N. Y. </em>525; Westcott <em>v. </em>Fargo, 63 <em>Barb. </em>351, S. C. 6 Lansing, 319).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b139-6\">7th. The plaintiffs not only did not perform the stipulation to \u201cmake every effort,\u201d etc., but committed an act which violated both the letter and spirit thereof.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b139-7\">It imposed upon them the duty, not only of refraining from every act which might lead to a strike, but also to use every endeavor to prevent one which might be threatened, and suppress or conciliate any which might arise without any provocation from them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b139-8\">The evidence, and the express finding of the referee, on this point, however, is, that the plaintiffs were the aggressors. They <em>provoked </em>the strike by <em>reducing </em>the wages of their miners.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b140-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>They would have \"been \"bound to have acceded to a demand on the part of their miners for <em>increased </em>wages, if thereby they could have\"prevented a threatened strike, and been enabled to perform their contract. And if so, they cannot take advantage of their own wrong, by pleading their own act in avoidance of the contract.\"</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b140-4\">8th. The plaintiffs were guilty of bad faith. The defendants entered into the contract, with reference to the state of things then existing; but plaintiffs had already, before the date of the contract, taken steps towards reducing their miners\u2019 wages, and suppressed the fact, although their experience had taught them that any dispute with their miners respecting wages was likely to result in a strike.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b140-5\">And this has been the experience of the entire community for years.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b140-6\">\u25a0 The subject of laborers\u2019 wages is always an exceedingly delicate one, and its agitation invariably leads to insubordination.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b140-7\">In the light of this experience, plaintiffs\u2019 act was without excuse\u2014it was culpable. Indeed, their own evidence shows that they regarded a strike as possible, in consequence of the. proposed reduction, for they consulted Storrs, their superintendent, on the subject..And although he advised them that \u201cin his judgment' there was no possibility of a strike,\u201d yet it is evident that in so advising he disregarded the teaching of his-experience.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b140-8\">Besides, plaintiffs had no right to urge the advice of Storrs in justification of their course. He was their own agent, and an officer of the company. It is analogous to the case of a party setting up his own opinion and judgment in extenuation of his wrongful act.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b140-9\">Again, it is absurd for plaintiffs to argue their good faith from the fact that the strike resulted in a loss to-them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b140-10\">They certainly <em>expected to derive </em>a <em>benefit from the </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number><em>proposed reduction of wages ; </em>no other motive for it can be assigned. If they had anticipated that <em>injurious results </em>would flow from their reduction, that circumstance would be rather an evidence of their <em>folly </em>than of their <em>good faith </em>in making\u2019 it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b141-4\">9th. If, therefore, the strike was the natural and probable consequence of the plaintiffs\u2019 act in reducing the wages of their miners, they will be presumed to have intended that result.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b141-5\">10th. Again, when the plaintiffs discovered them mistake, they were bound by their stipulation to retrace their steps, and use \u201cevery effort\u201d to conciliate their miners.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b141-6\">It involved no element of impossibility, or even of \u25a0difficulty, but merely a question of dollars and cents.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b141-7\"><em>Edwards </em>&amp; <em>Odell, </em>attorneys, <em>Hamilton Odell </em>and <em>Jacob </em>Vanelte, of counsel for respondents, urged:</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aae\">The defendants insist that the strike \u25a0 furnishes no excuse to the plaintiffs for non-delivery, because, they say, it was caused by the plaintiffs\u2019 reduction of the miners\u2019 wages. They say that the law presumes that the plaintiffs <em>intended </em>the results of their own act.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b141-8\">1. We deny the application of this principle here, but if applicable, it is true only as to the \u201cnecessary\u201d results (Van Pelt <em>v. </em>McGrraw, 4 N. <em>Y. </em>110); the \u201c natural \u201d results (Hain <em>v. </em>Wilson, 9 <em>Barn and Cress. </em>643);\u2014the \u2018 <em>\u2018 </em>natural and probable results\u2019 \u2019 (1 <em>Green on Ev. </em>p. 18, \u00a7 24). The evidence of Mr. Storrs shows that .the plaintiffs had no good reason to expect or fear that a strike would be the \u201cnecessary,\u201d or the \u201cnatural,\u201d or the \u201c probable,\u201d result of the reduction.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b141-9\">The law also presumes that- men act according to their own interests (1 <em>Phil. on Ev. </em>608). It is in evidence that former strikes had resulted injuriously to the plaintiffs \u201cin a stoppage of their business, decreasing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>their revenues, without any proportionate decrease of expenditures.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b142-4\">It is too clear to need argument, that nothing \"but absolute necessity would lead the plaintiffs to pursue any course of action which would or might provoke a strike on the part of their employ\u00e9s.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b142-5\">2. The language of section 10 of the terms of sale is of the broadest character ; \u2018 \u2018 storms, floods, breaks, accidents, combinations, turn-outs, strikes among miners or other employ\u00e9s, or any other occurrence whatsoever.\u201d The thing guarded against was \u201ca strike\u201d\u2014 not a strike from one cause or another, but <em>any </em>strike from <em>any </em>cause, \u201cor any other occurrence whatsoever,\u201d whereby their supply of coal would be materially diminished.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b142-6\">3. The proof shows that,' prior to December, 1870, during the whole period of their existence, the company had, from time to time, altered the rate of miners\u2019 wages. It- was a circumstance occurring in and forming a part of the ordinary administration of the company\u2019s business. The defendants dealt with them knowing, or bound to know, that circumstances might require or justify a change in the price of labor. It is absurd to insist that there was an implied agreement on the part of the plaintiffs to make no reduction in wages, or other change in the system of conducting their business, which might be distasteful to, or not meet the approval of, the miners, and so possibly lead to a suspension of work.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b142-7\">Any change by the plaintiffs in the mode of managing or operating their <em>mines\u2014e. g., </em>in the. mode of mining coal, in hours of labor, in the amount of the daily production, a new system of ventilation, a new regulation designed to' prevent accidents to laborers or to-preserve the company\u2019s property from injury or destruction, the introduction of mechanical aid by which the miners\u2019 labor would be lightened and the force of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>laborers be reduced, might be unsatisfactory to the employes, and lead directly to a strike.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b143-4\">But will it be seriously insisted that a strike for such a cause would <em>not </em>be a strike within the meaning of section 10 of the terms of sale ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b143-5\">Is section 10 to be construed as relating only to strikes which the company should <em>not be able to prevent? </em>That would require an accession by the plaintiffs to whatever demands the miners might advance.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b143-6\">Is it to be construed as relating only to strikes which should not be induced, directly or indirectly, by any act or omission of the plaintiffs ? That would require, practically, submission to the miners. It would prohibit any change of operations to which they did not assent. It would involve the partial surrender by the directors of the company of their right and <em>legal duty </em>to manage the affairs of the company according to <em>their </em>best judgment. It would impose upon the company such an implied agreement as has been above alluded to.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b143-7\">4. In the interpretation of a written contract the court will look to antecedent and surrounding facts and circumstances to ascertain its meaning (Blossom <em>v. </em>Griffin, 13 N. <em>Y. 574, 576 </em>; Field <em>v. </em>Woodmancy, 10 <em>Cush. </em>431; Mill Dam Foundry <em>v. </em>Hovey, 21 <em>Pick. </em>441).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b143-8\">Here it appears that the defendant, H. E. Bowns, had for four years prior to the sale of November, 1870, been a regular attendant and purchaser at the plaintiff\u2019s auction sales, during which period'the plaintiffs had, from time to time, changed the wages of their miners, and strikes had resulted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b143-9\">During all this period, also, the Miners\u2019 Association had been in existence. It was composed of 30,000 members, most of them in the employ of other parties than the plaintiffs. It was thoroughly organized, and acted unitedly. In consequence of it, the plaintiffs had not the free control of their own business. They had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>not the free enjoyment of their own property. Their ability to fulfil contracts for future deliveries of coal was dependent, largely, upon the will of other parties, and therefore they prudently qualified their liability, as expressed in section 10.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b144-4\"><em>5. </em>The defendants will not seriously contend that the plaintiffs would have been bound to comply with any demand of the miners for an increase of wages, large or small. It is submitted that there is no difference in principle between a refusal to increase and a reduction under proper circumstances. The rate of wages in every department of labor <em>must </em>be fluctuating. It is a rule of trade. It is a matter of necessity. -The market value of labor must depend upon the market value' of the tiling which it produces. Wages of miners fixed when coal and cost of living were low, would not be <em>fair </em>wages when coal and cost of living had materially advanced. So wages, fixed when coal and cost of living were high, would be <em>unfair </em>when the price of coal or cost of living had sensibly decreased. A refusal to advance would be as unreasonable in the one case as a refusal to submit-to a reduction would be in the other.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b144-5\">6. The <em>good faith </em>of the plaintiffs in reducing the wages has not been questioned by defendants, and is \u25a0abundantly shown by the testimony of Storrs and Brisbin.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b144-6\">7. There was no agreement by the plaintiffs, express or implied, that they would continue any given rate of wages through the month of December, or for any time (Berwick v. Swindells, 3 <em>Adol. &amp; E. </em>868 ; Knowlton <em>v. </em>Sewall, 10 <em>All. </em>34.) Their contract was conditional, and they were discharged by the happening of the contingency against which they had provided.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b144-7\">By the Court.\u2014Sedgwick, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ATd\">The referee\u2019s findings do. not allude (nor did the argument of counsel) to the effect upon the construction of the contract, of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>fact that plaintiff\u2019s business was that of a purchaser of coal for sale by it, as well as that of mining coal. The proposed reduction of wages led to the miners in other collieries, that usually sold coal to plaintiff, stopping work, as well as to the strike in plaintiff\u2019s own mines. Probably nothing would be gained, for the consideration of the vital question between the parties by pursuing an inquiry suggested by this. When the contract says that every effort will be made by the company to fulfil its contract, but if strikes among miners materially decrease the quantity of coal the company would otherwise have to deliver, the company is not to be liable, it is clear that the contract meant such strikes as might happen against every effort which the company could use to prevent them. If the company could prevent a strike likely to lead to an inability to perform the contract, and did not, or if they, say, encouraged the workmen to such a strike, it would not be true that the company had made every effort to fulfil the contract. We are looking at what is contained in one sentence, and are satisfied that such isx the intended meaning of the phrase, strikes among miners.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-4\">This proposition is strengthened from these words, \" strikes among miners,\u201d being associated with\u201c storms, floods, breaks, accidents, and combinations and turnouts.\u201d These latter words have a quality in common, in relation to their leading to a non-fulfilment of the contract. That is, they are in their nature beyond .the plaintiffs\u2019 control. It is to be intended that \u201cstrikes among miners,\u201d as used, are such as have the same character of being beyond plaintiffs\u2019 control. This is not weakened by the fact that the words \u201cor any occurrence whatever \u201d are also used in connection with the words now considered. Particular words are not enlarged or varied by being conjoined to general words. On the contrary, general words are limited by particular ones used with them (Van Hagen v. Van <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>Rennsalaer, 18 <em>John. </em>p..428), and by the nature of the contract. These general words must have some limitation. They cannot mean that which is within their verbal significance, viz., that if the production of coal is stopped by the plaintiffs\u2019 direct order, the plaintiffs are not to be liable. The instrument, being a contract, and the nature of \u201cstorms, floods, and accidents,\u201d suggest that any occurrence, as specified in the contract, means-any unavoidable occurrence.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-4\">It is rather the exception than the rule, to give to a-word in a contract or a statute all the meanings which might be attributed to it, if it were to be defined as a word by itself: It is to be construed according to the</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">mode of its particular use. The words we examine are in a contract which the parties have made because of its character and force as a contract. Although the parties might have, if they had wished, made a stipulation in it that it should not entail any liability whatever on either one of them, yet until such a purpose is clearly manifested the fact remains that the parties mean that the contract should impose an obligation. That fact is a leading consideration in weighing the particular clauses of the agreement. These should not have given to them a meaning which will destroy the contract, when another meaning, which will uphold it, is at hand, just as fit and true as the former. The contract obligation remains, modified, but not destroyed.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">A late case is sufficient illustration of all this. A com-' mon carrier by special contract is exempted from liability for loss by fire. Verbally this means fire of any kind however caused. Yet the common carrier is liable if the fire happens from his own negligence (Lamb <em>v. </em>The Camden and Amboy Railroad Co., 46 <em>N. Y. R. </em>p. 271). It would be no answer to his liability that there was no intention of causing the loss by fire. The contract is not supposed to include a fire as to which he was but only negligent.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>I have come to the conclusion, from these considerations, that the true construction of the phrase \u201c strikes,\u201d etc., used as it is, is strikes that occur without any agency of plaintiff in inducing or causing them.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-4\">On this point, the learned counsel for the plaintiff made the observation that, from the peculiarities of the contract, it must be intended that the parties meant that the plaintiff should conduct its business according to its own customs and requirements, and that this involved the exercise of discretion by plaintiff in fixing its servants\u2019 wages, as it might do if no contract were made. We do not agree to this so as to relieve the plaintiff from any \"positive obligation it has made. There was an agreement to deliver. So far as any part of this throws upon the defendant the risk attendant upon a management at discretion by plaintiff of its business, the defendants bear such risks, but no further. The plaintiff has in effect contracted to manage its business so as to be able to deliver, excepting if inability to do this should come from the specified causes which are here examined.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">Another view of the matter may be taken. If one contracts unconditionally to do an act, the duty of performance is absolute, and it is his own fault if he do not especially provide against contingencies which prevent performance (Tompkins v. Dudley, <em>25 N. Y. R. </em>p. <em>272).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">In the contract before us there is an absolute engagement by plaintiff. In the first place, they limited their otherwise absolute agreement to deliver, by providing that if strikes among miners so interrupted their business as to materially decrease the quantity of coal they would otherwise have, then they should not be liable for a non-delivery. But they, as modifying all this, made an express and absolute engagement 1 <em>\u2018 </em>that every effort will be made by the company for the fulfilment of its contract.\u201d A breach of this creates a liability for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>damages that follow the breach, as would a breach of any other part of the agreement. This general obligation included the specific obligation to make every effort to prevent strikes. The finding of the referee is, that the company caused the strike by a proposal to reduce wages. The plaintiff places itself upon this strike as absolving them, under the contract, from the obligation to deliver. The evidence is, that the officers and agents consulted as to the probability of a strike following the reduction, and they came to the conclusion that it would not follow. To make every effort to prevent the strike required that they should abstain from acts which involved some probability of causing a strike, even if in the judgment of the officer the probabilities that it would not be so caused were greater or more in number. The proposal to reduce wages had an immediate connection with the means the company were using to fulfil the contract. They used men to get out the coal, and when they proposed to them to reduce their wages, for which they worked, it had a direct bearing upon the production of coal.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\">It was not necessary that the defendants should put their claim upon the breach of this particular clause. Their cause of action was the non-delivery of the coal. The plaintiffs were as a matter of defence to set up the exemption from liability (Hotham <em>v. </em>The East India Co., 1 <em>T. R. </em>p. 645), and the obligation to use every effort is an answer to that claim of exemption which the defendants were not obliged by our system of pleadings to set up, after the reply was served.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">I think, then, that the learned referee erred on two - grounds. First. The strike that occurred was not of the kind specified in the clause of exemption from liability. Second. The strike that diminished the plaintiff\u2019s supply of coal was caused by a breach of the plaintiff\u2019s agreement to use every effort to fulfil the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-7\">The case of Berwick <em>v. </em>Swindell (3 <em>A. &amp; E. </em>p. 868, 5 <em>N. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number><em>&amp; M. </em>p. 381), involved a contract which the court thought had expressly stipulated that the obligor might or might not, as he chose, do a certain act, and therefore he might do it although that created a <em>casus omissus, </em>as to which the other parts of the contract made no provision for Ms liability, and therefore he was not liable. The case, however, recognizes the rules of construction upon which we have acted in tMs case.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">Judgment reversed, order of reference vacated, and a new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">Barboub, C. J., and Freedman J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
