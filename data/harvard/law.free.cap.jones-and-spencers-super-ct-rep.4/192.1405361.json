The defendant, in his affidavit, read on the motion, stated \u201cthat he is ready, able, and willing to discharge and perform all his duties and liabilities as such trustee, and to give such security for the same as this court may deem necessary.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b202-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>On. the hearing of the motion the court deeming that security was necessary, made an order fixing the amount of the security to be given by defendants, and its form and conditions, and in the event that the security was not given by the time fixed in the order, the plaintiff\u2019s motion should be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">It having been left to the discretion of the court by the defendant to direct the giving of security, if it should be deemed necessary, we think that the order made by the judge directs the giving of such security, and if not given, that the motion he granted cannot be received on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">A decision made on motion, which is left to the discretion of the court by law, is not appealable, unless the discretion be abused (Briggs <em>v. </em>Vandenburgh, <em>22 </em>N. <em>Y. 468; </em>Foshay v Drost, 4 <em>Bosw. </em>664; Fort <em>r. </em>Bard, 1 <em>Corns. </em>43). If it was so left by the counsel of the parties, on a motion, and to be exercised in fixing the conditions of granting or denying a motion, the result would be same.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-7\">Besides, the granting of the order did not affect the merits of the controversy, or involve a substantial right under the issues in the action. It determined nothing on the merits against the defendants. Its object was to secure the money and profits for distribution under the deed of trust. This was in the interest of all the beneficiaries, and is not appealable, and was deemed necessary by the court (Sheldon <em>v. </em>Weeks, <em>2 Barton R. </em>533 ; Siney <em>v. </em>N. Y. Consol. Stage Co., 28 <em>How. </em>481; Moore v. Moore, 14 <em>Barb. </em>27; Rowley v. Van Benthuysen, 16 <em>Wend. </em>376).</p>\n<p id=\"b202-8\">The defendant may yet give the security ordered by Judge Curtis, and avail himself of its terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-9\">The order appealed from is affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-10\">Freeemah, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
