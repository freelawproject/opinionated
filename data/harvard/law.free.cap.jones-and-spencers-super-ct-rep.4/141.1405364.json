That on or about the 30th day of August, 1872, plaintiff and the defendant entered into an agreement whereby the plaintiff hired, and the defendant leased, for the term of one year from said date, at the rent then and there agreed upon between the parties of seven dollars per week, payable in advance, a part of the second floor of the premises then and now occupied by the defendant, known as No. 321 East Seventeenth Street, in the city of New York.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b150-12\">2.

That at the time of said hiring it was mutually understood and agreed by and between the parties hereto, that in consideration of the payment of the rent aforesaid the plaintiff should have and enjoy the use and benefit of the heat furnished by the furnace of defendant, and that defendant would cause to be done and performed sundry household matters and things for the benefit of the plaintiff and family.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b150-14\">4. That at the time of said hiring it was further <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>mutually agreed Tby and between the parties hereto, that upon the payment of three dollars per month by this plaintiff, in addition to the rent aforesaid, said plaintiff should have the use and benefit of the gas furnished from the meter of said defendant for cooking purposes and for light, but that subsequently defendant informed \u25a0plaintiff that he thought three dollars per month was not sufficient for the supply furnished, and plaintiff voluntarily paid thereafter four dollars per month for use \u2022of said gas.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b151-5\"><em>5. </em>That upon the conditions and agreements herein-before mentioned, this plaintiff entered in and upon said \u2022premises, and paid to the defendant the rent as aforesaid, .and in every way fully and faithfully performed each and every his part of said contract.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b151-6\">6.

The 167 section requires that causes of action united in a complaint must be separately stated, and the complaint calls it a fifth cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">There is no reference to the statements of other causes of action, or to the other parts of the complaint, except in the words \u201csaid apartments,\u201d which is nothing but .an identification of the place in which the acts were alleged to be done. The section of the Code in relation to stating separately the causes of action contained the substance of the former rule in respect of different counts in a declaration. \u201cBut unless the second count \u25a0\u201c expressly refers to the first, no defect therein will be \u201caided by the preceding count, for though both counts 16 6 are in the same declaration, yet they are for all purposes as distinct as if they were in separate declarations, and consequently they must independently contain all necessary allegations, or the latter count must \u201c expressly refer to the former.\u201d .</p>\n<p id=\"b157-7\">The fifth cause of action states only a tort. We cannot suppose that the pleader means to treat this tort as a breach of the contract set out in the first cause of action, because there is nothing whatever in the fifth cause of action that connects the two. In addition to this, the peculiar mode of allegation negatives the idea that in the fifth count the plaintiff relied on a breach of contract, and shows that he relied on a wilful and malicious injury by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>The joinder cannot \"be sustained on the ground that the causes of action arose out of the same transaction or transactions connected with the same subject of action. \u00a1Necessarily the statement of another cause of action.in a complaint implies that the pleader is proceeding tos\u00edate a different set of facts from those already stated. Therefore, unless there is something to expressly show to the contrary, it must be deemed that a new cause of action states another transaction than that already set out. The contrary may appear by such a statement of facts, that a comparison of it with what has already been stated will show the two to be parts of a transaction, or there must be an express reference to a former statement of a cause of action. In the present complaint there is neither. The transaction of the fifth cause of action does not on its face appear even to have occurred on the same day or days when the other acts set out in the other alleged causes of action are averred to have been done-</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">To me it seems that there is an attempt to join a cause of action on contract with a cause of action for tort, without the causes of action being parts of one transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">The judgment overruling the demurrer should be reversed, and judgment ordered for the defendant on the demurrer, with costs, with leave to plaintiff to amend the complaint within twenty days, on payment of costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-7\">Freedman, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b158-8\">Barbour, C. J. (dissenting).</author>\n<p id=\"AG8\">Although the complaint in this action may be liable to many serious objections, the only question which the court can properly consider upon this appeal is, whether the first cause of action is improperly joined in the same suit with the-fifth cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-9\">The respondent claims that the first cause of action Is for breaches of covenants in a lease, while the fifth is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>for injuries to personal property. Of course the onus of proving by the language of the pleading itself that his objection is well founded, is upon the party demurring. The plaintiff is entitled to all reasonable intendments in his favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">As a first cause of action the complaint charges that the defendant let certain premises to the plaintiff, and undertook that the latter should quietly occupy and enjoy the same, but <em>(inter alia) </em>that the defendant \u201c did shut, lock, bar, and chain the entrance to said \u201chouse, and did keep such entrance so locked and \u201cbarred,\u201d thereby depriving the plaintiff of the use of his premises,</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">The complaint charges for a fifth cause of action that the defendant, during the absence of the plaintiff from his apartments, obtained an entrance thereto by means of false keys, and removed the plaintiff\u2019s goods therefrom.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-7\">The facts as set forth in each of the. counts are sufficient, if properly stated, to constitute an action for a breach of the defendant\u2019s covenant for quiet enjoyment; and it follows that the two causes of action are not improperly joined. The judgment should therefore be affirmed, with costs; but leave should be given to the defendant, to apply at Special Term for permission to withdraw his demurrer and interpose an answer upon the usual terms.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
