Defendant\u2019s counsel thereupon offered to prove by this witness (at the same time stating to the court that he intended to call numerous other witnesses to the same facts), that the deceased was addicted to rowdy and ruffianly habits; that he was in the constant practice of perpetrating gross and unprovoked acts of violence upon the person and property of peaceful and unoffending citizens; that without any cause or provocation, he was in the habit of using knives and pistols, upon persons with whom he came in contact, thereby subjecting to imminent danger the lives of such persons; that it was the constant practice of the deceased to carry deadly weapons concealed about his person.

The authorities are numerous showing that on the state of facts disclosed by the bill of exceptions, proof of the violent and ruffianly character of the deceased was admissible in evidence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b568-6\"><em>Whenever the prisoner has been assaulted, however light the assault, even though not followed by a battery, </em>the authorities (with the exception of a single <em>nisi prius </em>case), are uniform in holding that it is the right of the prisoner to introduce such evidence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b568-7\"><em>State </em>v. <em>Tackett </em>(1 <em>Hawks, </em>210), was a case of alleged murder of Daniel, a slave. The prisoner was found guilty. A motion for a new trial was made in the Supreme Court. On the trial, among other things, the prisoner \u201c offered to prove that the deceased was a turbulent man, and that he was insolent and impudent to white people; but the court refused to hear such testimony, unless it would prove that the deceased was insolent and impudent to the prisoner in particular.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b568-8\">The court, per Taylor, C. J., in reference to this point, say': \u201c The conclusion they (the jury) might arrive at, was all important to the prisoner, since the degree of homicide depended on it; and whether it was malicious, extenuated or excusable, must have been determined by them, from such light as they could gather from the facts actually proved, and such inferences as they might deduce from them. It cannot be doubted that the temper and disposition of the deceased, and his usual deportment towards white persons, might have an important bearing on this inquiry, and, according to the aspect in which it was presented to the jury, tend to direct their judgment as to the degree of provocation received by the prisoner. If the general behavior of the deceased was marked with turbulence and insolence, it might, in connection with the threats, quarrels and existing causes of resentment he had against the prisoner, increase the probability that the latter had acted under a strong and legal provocation. If, on the contrary, the behavior of the deceased was usually mild and respectful towards white <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>persons, nothing could be added by it to the force of the other circumstances. They must still depend upon their own weight, and the probability be lessened, that the prisoner had received a provocation sufficient, in point of law, to extenuate the homicide. <em>The evidence, therefore, ought to have been </em>received.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b569-5\">In <em>Queensbury </em>v. <em>State </em>(3 <em>Stew. &amp; Port., </em>308), the Supreme Court, per Lipscomb, Ch. J., on a motion for a new trial, say: \u201c The circumstances under which this testimony was offered, are not shown by the record with sufficient clearness and distinctness to enable this court to determine whether it ought to have been admitted or not. That the good or bad character of the deceased, as an abstract proposition, can have no influence on the guilt of the accused, is too clear to admit of controversy.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b569-6\">\u201c To murder the vilest and most profligate of the human race, is as much a crime as if he had been the best, the most virtuous, and the greatest benefactor of mankind. But there can be no doubt but that when the killing has been under such circumstances as to create a doubt, the character of the accused may sometimes afford a clue by which the devious ways by which human action is influenced, may be threaded, and the truth attained. It is an acknowledged principle that if, at the time the deadly blow was inflicted, the person who so inflicts has well founded reason to believe himself in imminent peril, without having, by his fault, produced the exigency, that such killing will not be murder.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b569-7\">\u201c If the deceased was known to be quick and deadly in his revenge of imagined insults; that he was ready to raise a deadly weapon on every slight provocation; or, in the language of the counsel, 1 his garments were stained with many murders,\u2019 when the slayed had been menaced by such an one, he would find some excuse, in one of the strongest impulses of our nature, in anticipating the purposes of his antagonist.

It did not appear from the exceptions whether the prisoner had been assaulted, and, therefore, the appellate court could not determine whether, upon the trial, the evidence as to the violent character of the deceased should or should not have been admitted; nevertheless, the reasoning of the court, upon the point in question, may be regarded as an adjudication.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b570-7\">In <em>Monroe </em>v. <em>State </em>(5 <em>Geo.

The Supreme Court, per Lumpkin, J., on a motion for a'new trial, on this, among other grounds, say: \u201c It is further argued that the court erred in rejecting evidence which went to show that the deceased was a violent, rash and bloody-minded man\u2014reckless of human life,\" &amp;c. * * \u201c As a general rule, it is true, that the slayer can derive no advantage from the character of the deceased for violence, provided the killing took place under circumstances that showed he did not believe himself in danger. <em>Yet, in cases of doubt, xohether the homicide was perpetrated </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number><em>ill malice, or from a principle of self preservation, it is proper to admit any testimony calculated to illustrate to the jury the motive by which the prisoner was actuated. </em>(3 <em>Stew. &amp; Port., </em>308.) <em>And in this view, we think the evidence was improperly ruled out. </em>Reasonable fear, under our code, repels the conclusion of malice; and has not the character of the deceased for violence much to do in determining the reasonableness or unreasonableness of the fear under which the defendant claims to have acted ? Does it make no difference whether one\u2019s adversary be a reckless and overbearing bully, having a heart lost to all social ties and order, and fatally bent on mischief, or is a man of Quaker-lilte mien and deportment ? One who never strikes, except in self-defence, and then evincing the utmost reluctance to shed blood? We apprehend that the imminence of the danger, as well as the chances of escape, will depend greatly upon the temper and disposition of one\u2019s foe.

There was evidence going to show that the <em>deceased assaulted, the prisoner, </em>although it did not appear that the assault was accompanied by a battery. On the trial, testimony was offered to show the violent character of deceased in the place where the homicide occurred. This was ruled out, and exception taken.

In such case, the act and <em>status of </em>the actor must be taken together, in order to arrive at a just conclusion respecting its nature. Thus it is, the character of the deceased becomes a legitimate subject of inquiry, as connecting itself with the transaction, which it may serve to explain. But however bad or desperate that character may be, and however many threats such person may have made, he forfeits no right to his life, until by an actual attempt to execute his threats, or by some act or demonstration at the time of killing, taken in connection with such character or threats, he induces a reasonable belief, on the part of the slayer, that it is necessary to deprive him of life, in order to save his own, or to prevent some felony upon his person.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b573-5\">In <em>Franklin </em>v. <em>State, </em>29 <em>Ala., </em>14), defendant was convicted of the murder of his brother..

Conduct of a man of peaceable character and harmless deportment, might pass by without exciting a reasonable apprehension of imminent peril; while, on the other hand, the same conduct from a man of notoriously opposite character and habits, might reasonably produce a consciousness of the most imminent peril, and a conviction of the necessity of prompt defensive action. Whenever such bad character on the part of the deceased thus illustrates the circumstances attending a homicide, and the circumstances, so illustrated, tend to produce a reasonable belief of imminent danger in the mind of the slayer, the character, as mingled with the transaction, is a part of it, and is indispensable to its correct understanding. Such we understand to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>be in effect the decisions in Queensbury\u2019s and Pritchett\u2019s case. <em>(Pp. </em>17, 18.) * * * * * *</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b574-5\">\u201cWhen the conduct of the deceased, although in itself innocent, is such that, illustrated by his character, its tendency is to excite a reasonable belief of imminent peril, the evidence ought to be admitted, and the question of its effect left to the determination of the jury.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b574-6\">In case of <em>Com. </em>v. <em>Seibert, </em>referred to in <em>Whar. on Hom, (pp. </em>227, 228), \u201cthe court, for the purpose of aiding in the discovery of the <em>character </em>of the homicide, permitted the defendant to prove the general character and disposition of the deceased, as a <em>quarrelsome, fighting, vindictive and brutal man, </em>of great physical strength. <em>(P. </em>227.) Judge Comingham, in charging the jury, said: \u201cYou may inquire, too,, whether the deceased, making, as is contended, the first ^ assault, was bold, strong and of a violent and vindictive character, and the defendant much weaker and of a timid disposition, and how far their power was equalized by weapons in the hands of the latter.\u201d * * * * *\u25a0 *</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b574-7\">\u201cIn the assault of a strong man upon a boy, or a female, of a powerful individual upon a weaker, the necessity of taking life in self-defence under an ordinary attack, will be more easily discoverable than in an attack by one man upon another under more equal circumstances.\u201d <em>(P. </em>228.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b574-8\">In <em>Dukes </em>v. <em>State, </em>decided in 1858 (11 <em>Ind., </em>557), this point arose: At the trial, the prosecution, upon objection by prisoner\u2019s counsel, was permitted to give evidence of the character of deceased.

In speaking of the request on the part of the prisoner\u2019s counsel, to charge the jury, that if they believed from the evidence that the deceased was of rash, turbulent and violent disposition, then it was a circumstance for the consideration of the jury, in considering the reasonable cause for defendant\u2019s apprehension of great personal injury to himself.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b575-7\">The court, per Eichardson, J., say: \u201cIn my opinion, <em>this instruction ought to have been given. </em>If the defendant killed Mills under circumstances that showed he did not have reasonable cause to apprehend immediate danger of violence to himself, he cannot defend himself on the ground of the vicious character of the deceased, for the law promises the same protection to the persons of all men, and it is as great a crime, in the eye of the law, to kill, without cause, a bad man as a good one. But the imminence of danger, that will justify us in acting upon the instinct of our nature in repelling a blow before it is received, often depends on the character of the assailant. The menacing attitude of a person generally peaceable and law-abiding, would often excite no just apprehension of danger, whilst similar conduct of a fierce, vindictive and passionate man, would naturally alarm our fears, and make us prompt in anticipating his purposes. When danger is threatened and impending, we are not compelled to stand with our arms folded until it is too late to strike, but the law permits us to act on reasonable fear; and therefore, when the killing has been under circumstances that create a doubt, as to whether the act was committed in malice, or from a sense of real danger, the jury have the right to consider any testimony that will explain the motive that prompted the accused.\u201d <em>(Queensbury </em>v. <em>State, </em>3 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number><em>Stew. &amp; Port., </em>308; <em>Munroe </em>v. <em>State, 5 Geo., </em>137.) \u201cThe judgment will be reversed, and the cause remanded.\u201d <em>(Pp. </em>590, 591.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"74\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b576-5\">In <em>Payne </em>v. <em>Com. </em>(1 <em>Met.

Deceased did not assault, or attempt to assault the prisoner. Deceased did no act which he had not a legal right to do. On that trial, the counsel for the prisoner offered to prove that deceased was in the habit of drinking to excess whenever he could get rum, and that drinking spirits of any kind had the effect of making him quarrelsome, dangerous and savage.

This cannot be regarded as an authority against the admission of evidence of the violent character of deceased, where he has assaulted the prisoner. In this case, Harrington, one of the judges, intimates, that he has known of the introduction of evidence of this kind in four cases, and that such evidence comes within the reason of the principle, that, \u201c in particular cases, where the character of the prosecutor is mingled with the transaction in question, it forms a point material to the issue, and may consequently be inquired into.\u201d <em>(Ros.

There was no pretence that he had assaulted prisoner, nor was proof offered that he had assaulted others. The Supreme Court, per Turley, J., upon this point, say: \u201cThe second cause assigned as error, is that the court refused to hear proof, to show that the prosecutor, Underwood, who is a free man of color, was a turbulent, insolent, saucy fellow. We think there was no error in this; for, supposing him to have been of the character described, we cannot see how this would have extenuated the offence of stabbing him, and most certainly the prisoner does not stand in such a relation towards him as to justify his being very particular in demanding respectful treatment from him.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"80\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b577-6\">Here it will be perceived that the offer was not to prove that deceased was a man of violent habits, and accustomed to commit assaults upon peaceful and unoffending persons, but that he was a \u201cturbulent, violent and saucy fellow.\u201d The offer of proof related merely to <em>words </em>used, and not to <em>acts </em>done by the prosecutor.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"81\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b577-7\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Tilly </em>(3 <em>Iredell, </em>424) the prisoner was indicted for the murder of one William G-.

On objection' made on the part of the State, the court rejected the evidence. This ruling was sustained. The court, per Ruffin, Ch. J. (p. 50), say: \u201c It is too much to stake the life of one man upon the fears of another of danger from him, merely upon his character for turbulence, and when he is making no assault.

In the eye of the law, to murder the vilest and most abject of the human race, is as great a crime as to murder its greatest benefactor. In one or two cases, however, while the law, as above laid down, was distinctly recognized, it has been said that when the killing has been under such circumstances as to create a doubt as to the character of the offence committed, the general character of the deceased may sometimes be drawn in evidence. But the rule undoubtedly is, that the character of the deceased can never be made a matter of controversy, except when involved in the <em>ros gesteo, </em>for it would be a barbarous thing to allow A. to give as a reason for killing B., that B.\u2019s disposition was savage and riotous.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"87\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b579-6\">The same author, in his work on Homicide (p. 249), says: \u201cIt has already been briefly considered how far the character of the deceased for. peace and order may be drawn into question, when the defence taken is, that the defendant, from all the circumstances in the case, of which the deceased\u2019s character was one, had reason to be in fear of his life. As was then shown, there have been cases in which courts have been obliged to allow such evidence to be introduced, and it is easy to imagine cases in the future in which it would be impossible to exclude it. But, as a general principle, the rule continues unbroken that evidence that the deceased was riotous, quarrelsome and savage, is inadmissible, even though such knowledge be brought home.to the defendant himself.

As an illustration of the fact, that the Supreme Court of Massachusetts is liable to err, it may not be considered <em>mal-apropos to </em>refer <em>to </em>the case of Dr. Webster. On the trial of <em>Cancemi </em>at the New York Oyer and Terminer, the learned judge who presided, in his charge to the jury, read with approval an extract from the charge of Chief Justice Shaw, in the case of Webster, in relation to the weight to be given to the good character of the prisoner. For this error a new trial was granted. The Court of Appeals held that the doctrine laid down by the Supreme Court of Massachusetts, in that case (5 <em>Cush., </em>314), was not law, and that character was of far more importance than that court was disposed to concede.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"92\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b581-6\">In the case at bar, \u201cit was conceded by the prosecution that the defendant was a person of good character for integrity, peace and quietness.\u201d In such a case, it was especially proper, that he should be allowed to prove the ruffianly character of deceased. With the solitary exception of <em>Com. </em>v. <em>Hillyard, </em>not a single case sustaining the ruling of the judge below can be found, while the authorities are uniform and abundant, showing his error.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"93\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b581-7\">In a word, all the authorities show that if the prisoner be assaulted by the deceased, evidence of the violent character of the latter is admissible. In the case at bar, Efomer,-the prisoner, was assaulted by Sturgis, the deceased. It appears from the case, that deceased said he wanted \u201cto lick no man but the baker\u201d (prisoner), that he \u201ctook hold\u201d of prisoner, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>and that he (deceased), \u201chit defendant just as if he wanted to get him in a passion.\u201d ' \u00bb</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"94\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b582-5\">The testimony was therefore clearly admissible, and the exclusion of it by the court below was error, for which a new trial should be granted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"95\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b582-6\">2d. In order to render the testimony as to the violent character of deceased admissible, it was not necessary to prove that it was known to the prisoner.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"96\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b582-7\">Even where the deceased has made threats, with reference to the prisoner, they are admissible in evidence, <em>allhough not communicated to him.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"97\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b582-8\">In <em>Stewart </em>v. <em>State </em>(19 <em>O. R., </em>302), defendant was indicted for murder, and convicted. The Supreme Court held that it was competent for the defendant to prove that the person alleged to have been murdered, and others, had agreed to go to the house where defendant boarded, for the purpose of quarreling with him, and that they had approached him with that intent at the time the affray commenced, which resulted in the homicide;. and to prove the conversation of the parties in relation to such agreement, though the defendant had not been informed of the intent of the parties in approaching him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"98\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b582-9\">A new trial was granted on account of the exclusion of this testimony. The Supreme Court, per Caldwell, J., in discussing this point, say: \u201cIf such had been the object of these persons in this visit that night, it ought to be proved, although no in- - formation of the kind had been, in language, conveyed to the defendant. He might be able, when they met, from their manner and conduct to discover their intention, although they had made no verbal expression.\u201d (P. 306.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"99\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b582-10\">In <em>Keener </em>v. <em>State </em>(18 <em>Geo. R., </em>194), it was held that previous threats, if offered for the purpose of showing the state of mind or feeling of the deceased, were inadmissible, although not communicated to the prisoner.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"100\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b582-11\">In <em>Campbell </em>v. <em>People </em>(16 <em>Ill. R., </em>18), this point arose. The Supreme Court, per Cat\u00f3n, J., say: \u201cUpon the trial the defence offered to prove that on that day, and at other times shortly before his death, the deceased had made threats against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>the prisoner. This evidence the court ruled out, and an exception was taken. In this the court unquestionably erred, although they may never have come to the knowledge of the defendant till after the homicide was committed. If the deceased had made threats against the defendant, it would be a reasonable inference that he sought him for the purpose of executing those threats, and thus they would serve to characterize his conduct towards the prisoner at the time of their meeting, and of the affray.\u201d A new trial was granted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"101\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b583-5\">In the case of <em>Cornelius </em>v. <em>Com. </em>(15 <em>B. Mon. R., </em>539), the prisoner was charged with murder. On his trial he proved threats on the part of the person killed, to kill him, which threats had been communicated to him. He then offered to prove other threats, <em>-not </em>communicated, which the court refused to admit. It was held to be error to exclude such proof.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"102\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b583-6\">In <em>Dukes </em>v. <em>State </em>(11 <em>Ind., </em>557), before cited, on the trial the prosecution were allowed to prove the character of deceased, on objection by prisoner\u2019s counsel, although it was not proven or sought to be shown that the prisoner had any knowledge on the subject.' Exception was taken. The Supreme Court of Indiana sustained this ruling, although they say: <em>\u201c </em>Where, as in this case, these facts may not have been known, we do not see how the evidence could be entitled to much weight.\u201d Whether entitled to much weight or not, the court held the testimony to be admissible.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"103\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b583-7\">If threats are admissible in evidence, although not communicated, on the ground that such proof tends to show the <em>mental status </em>of the deceased, at the time of the homicide, afortiori, the character of the deceased for violence is admissible. The character of deceased for ruffianly violence, which he has built up for a series of years, would shed much more light on his mental status, and tend far more forcibly to illustrate his acts, than threats made some time previously, which might have been abandoned.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"104\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b583-8\">In some of the cases cited on Point I, it appears that the prisoner knew, and in others that he did not know, of the violent character of the deceased. The admissibility of the evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>dence has not been made to turn upon proof that prisoner possessed such knowledge, but the testimony has been admitted or rejected, according to the fact, whether deceased <em>assaulted </em>prisoner, or made some demonstration, which, in connection with his violent character, might give, or tend to give, the prisoner reasonable ground to believe he was in danger of loss of life or great bodily harm.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"105\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b584-5\">3d. In any point of view it was the right of the prisoner on the trial to introduce evidence of the violent character of the deceased.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"106\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b584-6\">This issue was opened by the prosecution, as will appear by the following extract from the re-direct examination of Frederick Schwitzgebele, a witness for the prosecution: <em>Re-direct examination: </em>Sturgis was in liquor that night; he generally came in every evening; <em>he generally conducted himself </em>quietly, and did no harm when he came in early in the evening; I never saw <em>the deceased do anything out of the way in my life; </em>I have known him a long while; he was in the habit of coming in our saloon almost every night for supper; I have been in that saloon several years, and was always in whenever the deceased and his friends came for supper; <em>I never saw him commit any act of </em>violence, <em>or do anything wrong''</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"107\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b584-7\">In <em>Dilkes </em>v. <em>State </em>(11 <em>Ind., </em>557), cited on the first subdivision of thti Point, the Supreme Court held that the prosecution had a right to go into evidence of this kind in the <em>first instance. </em>At all events, it is clear that, after the prosecution had introduced evidence on this point, it was competent for the prisoner to controvert that testimony.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"108\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b584-8\">It is true, it does not appear from the bill of exceptions that the prisoner\u2019s counsel objected to the evidence. It is equally true that the District Attorney did not object to the evidence on this point sought to be introduced by the prisoner. The learned judge, upon the trial, permitted the prosecution to give evidence upon the point in question, but of his own motion prohibited the defendant from introducing any testimony upon the subject.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"109\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b585-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>4th. If it were necessary (which it is not), to show that prisoner knew of the violent character of the deceased, one of the best means of proving such knowledge, would be to prove the <em>existence </em>of the character in question.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"110\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b585-5\">How else could such knowledge be shown, ordinarily, except from its notoriety in the town, city or locality where the pri' soner lived ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"111\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b585-6\">At all events, it should be left to the jury to infer the prisoner\u2019s knowledge of such character from its notoriety.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"112\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b585-7\">II. The court below clearly erred in refusing to allow the prisoner to prove that \u201c deceased was in the habit of committing violent assaults with knives and pistols upon the proprietors of restaurants, like that kept by the prisoner; and that deceased was in the habit of maliciously and wantonly destroying the property in such restaurants, and beating the inmates in such restaurants. The court refused to allow the evidence, or any part thereof, to be given; to which refusal the counsel for the defendant then and there duly excepted.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"113\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b585-8\">In <em>Monroe </em>v. <em>State </em>(5 <em>Geo., </em>85), cited on Point I, it was held, (as has already been shown) that the prisoner had a right to prove the character for violence possessed by the deceased, in \u00abbrothels, as contradistinguished from his peaceful character elsewhere. Clearly, within the reasoning of this case, the violent character of deceased in restaurants was admissible. Besides, the prosecution had opened the door to this evidence, in proving by the witness, Schwitzgebele, that the deceased possessed a peaceful character in restaurants, or, rather, in the restaurant where the homicide occurred.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"114\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b585-9\">It will be observed that the testimony was ruled out, not on the ground that it was not offered to be proved that prisoner knew the character of deceased in this particular. The evidence was excluded unconditionally and unqualifiedly.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"115\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b585-10\">TIT. The court below erred in charging the jury \u201cthat if they (the jury) believed the prisoner was in great danger of loss of life or serious personal injury at the hands of the deceased, and killed him in that defence of life or person, he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>was justified, <em>otherwise not. </em>To this portion of the charge the counsel for the prisoner then and there duly excepted.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"116\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b586-5\">The court reiterated the same idea in another part of the charge, as will appear by the following extract from the bill of exceptions:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"117\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b586-6\">\u201c The court thereupon charged the jury, that to justify the taking of life, the danger of the person taking it must be real and imminent. To this portion of the charge the counsel for the prisoner then and there duly excepted.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"118\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b586-7\">In the case of <em>Shorter </em>v. <em>The People </em>(2 Comst., 193), it was held that the charge of the court to the jury, \u201c that, to render the killing justifiable, the jury should be satisfied that, there was, in fact, imminent danger that the deceased would commit some great personal injury upon the prisoner,\u201d was erroneous.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"119\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b586-8\">The charge in this case was the same as in the case of Pfomer. The Court of Appeals distinctly held that one who is without fault himself, when attacked by another, may kill his assailant, if the circumstances be such as to furnish reasonable ground for apprehending a design to take away his life, of do him some great bodily harm, and there is also reasonable ground for believing the danger imminent that such design will bq accomplished, although it may afterwards turn out that the appearances were false, and there was, in fact, no such design, nor any danger that it would be accomplished.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"120\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b586-9\">This doctrine was re-affirmed by the Court of Appeals, in the case of <em>The People </em>v. <em>Sullivan </em>(3 <em>Seld., </em>396). The court, per Johnson, J., say: \u201c It was contended on the argument that this charge required the jury to find whether imminent danger <em>actually </em>existed, and not merely whether Sullivan had reasonable ground to believe that it existed. If this construction of the charge was correct, the case of <em>Shorter </em>v. <em>The People </em>(2 <em>Comst., </em>197), would show it to be erroneous, but we do not so understand the charge.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"121\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b586-10\">It will be seen that the charge of the court below in this particular, was in direct violation of these two decisions of the Court of Appeals.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"122\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b587-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>\u00cdY. The court below erred in instructing the jury, \u201c that if they believed the witnesses, the case was clearly within one of the degrees of manslaughter, and it was for the -jury to say which degree.\u201d To this portion of the charge the counsel for the prisoner duly excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"123\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b587-5\">The court had already submitted the case to the jury, as to whether the prisoner was in imminent danger. The language of the court, in its charge, was:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"124\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b587-6\">\u201c That if they (the jury) believed the prisoner was in great danger of loss of life, or of serious personal injury, at the hands of the deceased, and killed him in that defence of life or person, he was justified, otherwise not.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"125\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b587-7\">If it were right to submit this question of fact to the jury, it was error to withdraw its consideration from them. The effect of this appears from the fact that, although the jury had been out over twenty-four hours, yet, after this charge was given, \u201c they thereupon retired, and after an absence of some ten minutes, returned into the court with a verdict of guilty.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"126\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b587-8\">The authorities cited under Point I, show that whenever the. prisoner is assaulted by the deceased, it is a question <em>for the jury </em>to determine whether the prisoner had reasonable ground to believe himself in danger of loss of life, or great bodily harm.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"127\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b587-9\">It is plain that the court erred in this particular. In proof of this, although many cases might be cited, the following will suffice:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"128\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b587-10\">In the case of <em>Holmes </em>v. <em>State </em>(23 <em>Ala., </em>17), it was held that a charge which has the effect of withdrawing from the consideration of the jury any evidence which tends to establish the plaintiff\u2019s case or the defence, is erroneous. However correctly the judge may lay down the law in his general charge, yet, if in a subsequent specific charge, he places the case .upon the existence of certain facts, on which alone it may not properly be made to turn, the effect of which, if literally followed by the jury, is to withdraw from the consideration of other facts which tend neither to disprove or materially qualify those on which the charge is predicated, injury must be presumed from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>the error. The court, per Clinton, Ch. J., say: \u201cIn <em>Pritchett v. Monroe </em>(22 <em>Ala., </em>501), we held that a charge based upon a hypothetical state of facts, which excludes from the consideration of the jury other evidence which is before them, is erroneous, as tending to mislead the jury by creating the impression that they should be authorized to reject the other evidence.\u201d * * \u201c Such, we think, is the effect of the charge.\u201d <em>(Ib., </em>25.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"129\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b588-5\">In the case of <em>State </em>v. <em>Harrison </em>(5 <em>Jones N. C., </em>115), it appeared that at the trial the judge charged the jury that \u201c if the prisoner went to a house, carrying a deadly weapon, with the purpose of provoking a fight if he found a certain person there, and did so, he was guilty of murder, although the deceased made the first assault.\u201d This was held to be error, on the ground that it was for the jury to say whether this state of facts alone, if true, or in connection with other circumstances, proved the defendant guilty of murder.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"130\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b588-6\">In conclusion, I will cite a case recently decided by this court, which is precisely in point:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"131\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b588-7\">One James Breen was indicted in the New York General Sessions, for larceny. He was convicted of that offence. On the trial, it appeared that Thorpe (who employed Breen as a bar-keeper), with a view to detect him\u2014his suspicion having been previously excited\u2014marked certain bank bills, and put them in the money till. The next night, after Breen had retired to bed (according to the testimony of Spencer, another witness), these bills were found in his possession. It was the duty of Breen to hand over to his employer, every night when the bar closed, all the money. The court below charged the jury \u201c that the first two witnesses, Thorpe and Spencer, testified to a state of facts, which, if <em>true, </em>established a larceny of the prisoner, and rendered it incumbent on the jury to convict him.\u201d To this the prisoner\u2019s counsel excepted. This court sustained the exception, and granted a new trial. It was very properly held, that whether the circumstances, <em>if true, </em>established guilt, or whether they were as consistent with innocence as with guilt, was purely a question of fact for the jury. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>In view of the rule of law cited in that case, and to which I invoke the attention of the court in this, no other decision could well have been made.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"132\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b589-5\">\u201c It is therefore a rule of criminal law, that the guilt of the accused must be fully proved. \u00a1Neither a mere preponderance of evidence, nor any weight of preponderance, is sufficient for the purpose, unless it generate full belief of the fact, to the exclusion of all reasonable doubt.\u201d * * * * \u201cIt is elsewhere said, that the persuasion of guilt ought to amount to a moral certainty,\u201d or, \u201c such a moral certainty as convinces the minds of the tribunal, as reasonable men, beyond all reasonable doubt.\u201d \u201cAnd this degree of conviction ought to be produced, when the facts proved coincide with and are legally sufficient to establish the truth of the hypothesis assumed\u2014 namely, the guilt of the party accused\u2014and are inconsistent with any other hypothesis. \u00a1For it is not enough that the evidence goes to show his guilt; it must be inconsistent with the reasonable supposition of his innocence.\u201d (3 <em>Greenl. Mu., </em>\u00a729.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"133\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b589-6\">On the 6th of March, 1858, the general term, first district (composed of Justice Davies, Gierke and Sutherland), rendered a decision granting a new trial in the case of Breen, upon the point here stated, as well as upon another point not necessary to state.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"134\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b589-7\">The court below erred in each of the four points specified.

Evidence of the character of the deceased was rightly excluded, with the restriction laid down in the first ruling of the court. Such evidence is admissible where, from the facts of the killing, there is a doubt as to its character, for the purpose of establishing the theory of self-defence, in which case it must be brought to the knowledge of the defendant. It is not otherwise admissible. <em>(Fom. </em>v. <em>Seibert, Whar.

The other testimony excluded was of precisely the same nature, and its rejection must, by natural intendment, be taken to be subject to the same qualification, and there was no testimony offered to bring the subject-matter home to the knowledge of the deceased.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"138\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b590-6\">The last offers were also properly excluded, as relating to specific acts, disconnected entirely from the homicide in question. <em>(See cases cited under Point I.)</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"139\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b590-7\">m. The charge of the judge upon the question of self-defence, is not sufficient ground to set aside the verdict.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"140\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b590-8\"><em>(a.) </em>An omission to charge cannot be taken advantage of without a request to charge, and the same rule should apply to the remarks of the judge in this case. <em>(State </em>v. <em>Straw, </em>33 <em>Me., </em>554.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"141\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b590-9\"><em>(b.) </em>In the case of the <em>United States </em>v. <em>Wilberger </em>(3 <em>Wash.

Even though the charge be erroneous in this respect, there is no ground for a reversal. The same rules apply to bills of exceptions in criminal as in civil cases, and a verdict will not be set aside for a misdirection which could work no injury. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Wiley, </em>3 <em>Hill, </em>213; <em>Hagden </em>v. <em>Palmer, 2 Hill, </em>205; <em>Shorter </em>v. <em>The People, 2 Comst., </em>192.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"144\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b590-12\">There is no evidence anywhere in the case to call for any discretion whatsoever upon the subject of self-defence, and the charge was in that respect wholly irrelevant to the facts of the case, and could not, upon its face, or by intendment of law, work any injury to the defendant. <em>(Shorter </em>v. <em>The People, 2 Comst., </em>192; <em>Whar. on Hom., </em>212, <em>et seg.

Clearly, where a case rests upon circumstances, it is for the jury to construe those circumstances, and say whether they necessarily impute guilt to the defendant, or whether they are consistent with his innocence.
