The issue so joined came up to be tried on the first day of February, 1860, before Mr. Justice Ingraham, and a jury was duly impanneled to try said issue. The prosecution called, beside other material witnesses, Stephen Leary, a brother of the deceased, who testified that he witnessed the occurrences which resulted in the death of the deceased. This witness, as also others, testified to the circumstances immediately connected with the homicide of the deceased. He testified that he (the witness) was then in his eighteenth year. On the cross-examination of the witness, he admitted that he had been previously convicted of burglary, in the Court of General Sessions of the Peace, in and for the city and county of New York, and that he had been sentenced to the House of Eefuge. The witness further testified that he had not been sent to the House of Eefuge at any other time. The counsel for the prisoner then procured from the clerk of said Court of General Sessions a copy of the record of the conviction of said Stephen Leary, of petit larceny, duly certified by the said clerk of the said Court of General Sessions, and introduced the same in evidence, which said certified copy of said record of conviction is in the words and figures following:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b355-8\">\u201cAt a Court of General Sessions of the Peace, holden in and for the city and county of New York, at the City Hall of the said city, on Tuesday, the 22d day of June, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and fifty-eight.

The counsel for the prisoner thereupon moved to strike out the evidence of said Stephen Leary. The court denied said motion, and refused to strike out the evidence of said Stephen Leary, to which the counsel for the prisoner then and there duly excepted. Testimony of other witnesses for the prosecution was given. Among the witnesses for the defence, one Thaddeus Spencer was called, who testified, among other things, that he saw the prisoner at about ten o\u2019clock in the forenoon of the day when the homicide of the deceased occurred, and about three hours after the homicide occurred; that at this time the prisoner was cut behind the right ear, apparently by a knife or some sharp instrument, and the wound was bleeding freely. The witness further testified that he. also saw at that time a cut upon the hat of the prisoner; it was claimed by the defence that this cut was made by the deceased, before the prisoner used a knife upon the deceased, and by the prosecution that the wound had been inflicted after the deceased had been stabbed by the prisoner (either by the brick thrown at him by Stephen Leary, or in the mode testified to by another witness). On cross-examination by the District Attorney, the following question was put to the witness:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b356-6\"><em>Q. </em>Do you know that the prisoner had a cutting match with any one previous to the killing of Leary ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b356-7\">To this question the counsel for the prisoner duly objected.

(1 <em>Hale's Pl. Cr., </em>530; 1 <em>Hawk. P.

Ev., </em>30.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b357-14\">In <em>Ward </em>v. <em>People </em>(3 <em>Hill, </em>398), Nelson, Ch. J., on this subject observes: \u201c It was doubtless intended by the Legislature to reduce the offence of petit larceny to the grade of a misdemeanor; but I am inclined to think they did not accomplish their object. The statute declares that1 Every person who shall be convicted of stealing &amp;c., the personal property of another, of the value of twenty-five dollars or under, shall be adjudged guilty of petit larceny, and shall be punished by imprisonment in the county jail,\u2019 &amp;c. (2 <em>B. S., </em>691, \u00a7 1.) The crime is felony at common law (2 <em>East. Cr. L., </em>736; <em>3d Chitty's Cr. L., </em>924), and the only provision in the statute that can go to change the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>common law character of the offence, is that which declares the term 1 felony,\u2019 when used in any statute, shall be construed to mean an offence for which the offender, on conviction, would be punishable by death, or by imprisonment in a State Prison. (2 <em>B. </em>/S'., 702, \u00a730.) This provision defines statute felonies, <em>but does not interfere with those existing at common law, untouched, by the statute, of which the offence of petit larceny is one.\"</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b358-5\">In the case of <em>Carpenter v. Nixon </em>(5 <em>Hill, </em>260), the defendant\u2019s counsel, for the purpose of <em>impeaching the credit of a witness </em>(not for the purpose of having the testimony stricken out, as in the ease at bar), who had been sworn and examined for the <em>plaintiff, </em>offered in evidence a record of the witness\u2019 conviction upon a charge of petit larceny. The plaintiff\u2019s counsel objected that the evidence was inadmissible, and the court sustained the objection. This ruling was held wrong, and a new trial was granted. The only point before the court was, whether it was competent to impeach the credit of a witness in this way. The court did not, and could not, decide anything beyond this. It could not decide that the witness was competent, for no objection to his competency was raised. The' observations of the judge who delivered the opinion, on the subject of the competency of the witness, are entirely <em>obiter.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b358-6\">The statute provides that \u201c no person sentenced upon a conviction for felony, shall be competent to testify,\u201d &amp;c. (3 <em>B. S., hiked., </em>988, \u00a733.) .</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b358-7\">This was so before the statute. The same section provides that \u201c no sentence, upon a conviction for any offence other than a felony, shall disqualify or render any person incompetent to be sworn,\u201d &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b358-8\">Although it is provided' <em>(lb., 989, </em>\u00a740) that \u201cthe term <em>\u2018 </em>felony,\u2019 when used in this act, or in any other statute, shall be construed to mean an offence for which the offender, on conviction, shall be liable by law to be punished by death, or by imprisonment in a State Prison,\u201d yet it has been held that petit larceny, for which, on conviction, a party is not liable to be punished \u201c by imprisonment in the State Prison,\u201d is a felony. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>It has also been held <em>(Keyser </em>v. Hardbeck, 3 <em>Duer, </em>373), that notwithstanding the principle that if \u201cA. buy goods of B., the latter having obtained them by a felony, no title passes; yet if one obtain goods by false pretences, and sell them to a <em>bona fide </em>purchaser, notwithstanding the seller is liable by law to be punished\u201d * * * \u201cby imprisonment in State Prison,\u201d the purchaser under such circumstances acquires a good title. Thus it would seem that the liability, upon conviction, to be sent to the State Prison, is not the test as to whether a particular crime be or be not a felony.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b359-6\">In <em>The People </em>v. <em>Adler </em>(3 <em>Park. Cr. R., </em>249), it was held at general term that the common law rule that petit larceny is a felony, has not been changed by the Revised Statutes. The defendant, on the trial of an indictment for assault and battery, offered to prove that the complainant had been guilty of petit larceny, and that the alleged assault and battery consisted in arresting him therefor. It was conceded that if the complainant had been guilty of a felony, the defendant had a right to arrest him without warrant. The court below held that petit larceny was a misdemeanor, and therefore the defendant had no right to arrest the complainant without warrant, and accordingly excluded the proposed evidence. The Supreme Court held this ruling to be wrong, <em>on the ground that petit larceny was still a felony, </em>and on this ground granted a new trial. Here the point was expressly adjudged, that petit larceny is still a felony, as at common law.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b359-7\">H. The learned judge erred in allowing the District Attorney to put the question to the witness, Spencer, \u201c Do you know that the prisoner had a cutting match with any one previous to the killing of Leary ?\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b359-8\">The bearing of this question was to permit the prosecution to establish the violent character of the prisoner, by proving particular acts of violence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b359-9\">Even were the prosecution allowed to prove bad character, it was not competent to do it in this way.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b359-10\">TTT- The indictment is fatally defective; it does not disclose a criminal offence within the rules of criminal pleading; it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>does not disclose facts sufficient to give the court below jurisdiction.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b360-5\">There is no allegation that Shay struck the blows which caused death. There is an averment that \u201c a certain knife \u201d * * * \u201c did beat, strike, stab,\u201d &amp;c., but it is nowhere alleged that Shay <em>directed or propelled the knife.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b360-6\">On the subject of indictments, in <em>Ghittfs Criminal Law, </em>172, it is observed, in speaking of the greater strictness required in criminal than in civil pleadings, \u201c for technical objections have been much more frequently admitted to prevail in criminal than in civil pleadings, and it was expressly laid down by Lord Mansfield, that a greater strictness is required in the former than is necessary in the latter.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b360-7\">\u201c Time as well as place, ought in general not merely to be mentioned at the beginning of the indictment, but to be repeated to every issuable and triable fact,\u201d * * *</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b360-8\">\u201cbut after the time has been once named with certainty, it is afterwards sufficient to refer to it in the words <em>then and there, </em>which have the same effect as if the day and year were actually repeated.\u201d (1 <em>Chitty Cr. L., </em>219, 220.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b360-9\">By bearing in mind this principle, for the purpose of properly dividing the averment, it will be perceived that the following analysis of the only count in the indictment is correct. The indictment charges:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b360-10\">1st. That Mortimer Shay made an assault upon John Leary.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b360-11\">2d.

The formal conclusion that Mortimer Shay, \u201cin the <em>manner and form, and by the means </em>aforesaid,\u201d * * *</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b360-17\">\u201c did kill and murder,\u201d &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b361-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>The following is the language of the indictment setting forth the assault, which is the first averment:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b361-5\">\u201c That Mortimer Shay, late of the first ward of the city of Mew York, in the county of Mew York aforesaid, on the twenty-third day of Movember, in the year of our Lord, one thousand eight hundred and fifty-nine, at the yard, city and county aforesaid, with force and arms, in and upon one John Leary, in the peace of the People of the State, then and there being, willfully and feloniously, and of his malice aforethought, did make an assault.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b361-6\">This is the first issuable fact.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b361-7\">The second issuable fact is: That Mortimer Shay held a knife in his right hand, which is set forth in the following language : \u201c A certain knife which he, the said Mortimer Shay, in his right hand then and there had and held.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b361-8\">The third issuable fact set forth in the indictment, is that a certain knife did beat, strike, stab, &amp;c., John Leary. This issuable fact is set forth in the following language: \u201cAnd that the said Mortimer Shay, a certain knife which he, the said Mortimer Shay, in his right hand then and there had and held, him, the said John Leary, in and upon the forehead, then and there willfully and feloniously, and of his malice aforethought, did beat, strike, stab, cut and wound.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b361-9\">This third issuable fact should have been, \u201c that Mortimer Shay, <em>with </em>a certain knife, did beat, strike, stab,\u201d &amp;c. The absence of the word <em>with </em>destroys the <em>gravamen </em>of this averment. This averment is the <em>gist\u2014the essence\u2014the soul of the whole indictment. </em>Unless it is here charged that Mortimer Shay, \u201ccut, thrust,\u201d &amp;c., that allegation is nowhere made; without supplying the word with, the language contained in this count cannot be forced to convey the idea that defendant inflicted the violence which caused death.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b361-10\">This averment contains a complete sentence, to wit, a nominative, a verb, and an objective case. This sentence, in order to determine what it means, should be construed by itself. It contains the allegations (and none other), in substance, that Mortimer Shay held a knife in his right hand, and that \u201c a cer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>tain knife\u201d (not Mortimer Shay), \u201cin and upon the forehead\u201d of \u201cJohn Leary,\u201d * * * <em>\u201c </em>did beat, strike, stab,\u201d &amp;c.This entire averment must be taken as it is, or be stricken out as surplusage. It cannot be stricken out as surplusage, for then there would certainly be no averment (even if my criticism of this language is all wrong) that Mortimer Shay struck the fatgil blow; and if there be no such averment, then clearly it is nowhere charged that defendant caused the death. If the averment must stand as it is, then there is no charge against the defendant, except that he held the knife in his right hand. (And even this not well pleaded.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b362-6\">In an indictment for homicide, it is necessary to set forth the means causing the death of the \"deceased.

The substance of the charge now sought to be made in the indictment, is that defendant <em>with </em>a knife stabbed John Leary, and in that way killed him, and therefore is guilty of murder. The third averment, charging that the <em>\u201c </em>knife <em>\u201d </em>* \u201c did cut, thrust, stab,\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"113\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b368-9\">&amp;c., is the only averment whose office should be to charge that defendant gave the blows which caused death. The giving of the blows <em>with </em>\u201ca certain knife,\u201d is the only criminal act that could be imputed to defendant,- if the indictment were properly framed. With the exception of the first averment, that defendant made an assault which, in an indictment for murder, would be unimportant unless accompanied by a blow or battery, and with the exception of the second averment, that defendant held a knife in his right hand, all that is alleged is simply a matter of <em>inference, conclusion or deduction, </em>from the premises previously stated.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"114\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b368-10\">The fourth averment of the giving of a mortal wound, and the fifth averment that death was the result of that wound, are certainly but deductions from the previous averment, as much so as if the fourth and fifth averments had used the language, \u201c in manner and form aforesaid.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"115\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b369-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>The learned judge says: \u201c The indictment would read so as to charge the offence, if'these were included in a parenthesis\u2014That the said Mortimer Shay (he, the said Shay, then holding a knife in his hand), did stab, beat, strike and wound the said Leary, and giving unto the said Leary, then and there with the knife aforesaid, a mortal wound,\u201d &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"116\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b369-5\">It is a sufficient answer to say that such is not the language of the indictment. It must be held sufficient or insufficient as it is. No court has the power to leave out certain words and insert others, or to rearrange or transpose the language, in order to cover up its legal deformity. As was said by the Supreme Court in <em>State </em>v. <em>Leach </em>(27 <em>Vt. R., </em>317), where a <em>single </em>word, as here, was left out in the indictment (after speaking of the omission of word), \u201c though no doubt a mistake,\u201d the court say, \u201c but can this omission be supplied or cured by intendment?

The court observe, 11 <em>if they were stricken out, the complaint would allege an exact day! (State </em>v. Barker, 34 Maine, 52.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"119\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b369-8\">It is said that \u201cif, however, an averment may be entirely omitted, without affecting the charge against the prisoner, and without detriment to the indictment, it may be disregarded in evidence.\u201d <em>(State </em>v. Copp, 15 <em>N.

In what averment ? Certainly not in the third averment, which alleges the blow, the only act which could be criminal on the part of the defendant. It is, however, but just to quote the whole of this part of the opinion: \u201c The offence is fully stated without the word omitted; and although it is necessary to name the weapon with which the death was effected, the indictment sufficiently shows it, notwithstanding the omission of the word complained of. The cases cited by the prisoner\u2019s counsel are none of them applicable to this case. They relate to cases where the defect was in charging the of-fence ; here it is merely in relation to the weapon with which the offence was committed, and in that respect the objection is remedied by the subsequent part of the count in the indictment, which charges expressly that the wound was given with the knife, and that of such wound the deceased died.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"123\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b370-7\">It is submitted:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"124\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b370-8\">1st. That there is no difference, either in law or common sense, between stating the offence and stating the means or weapon with which it was perpetrated. <em>The statement of an offerice includes a statement of every fact legally essential to constitute that offence. </em>As well might it be said that the description of a paper forged, formed no part of the statement of the of-fence of forgery, or that the description of an article stolen, or that the asportation or carrying away of the thing stolen formed no part of the statement of the offence of larceny, as to say, that the description of the act of a party in cutting and stabbing <em>with </em>a knife, is not a part, and a most material part, of the description of the offence in an indictment for murder. This is the most material part of the offence; in short, it is emphatically <em>the offence itself.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"125\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b370-9\">2d. The objection to the indictment is not that it does not appear that the knife caused the mortal wound, and that of such wound the deceased died. If the learned judge thought <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>that, because it appeared that the knife caused the wound, and the wound resulted in death, the objection made to the principal averment in the indictment was obviated, he, through the fault of counsel probably, entirely misapprehended the nature of the objection. If he intended to hold that the subsequent averments charged that the prisoner struck the blows with a knife, then such a doctrine is diametrically opposed to the well settled rule of criminal pleadings, and the uniform current of adjudged cases.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"126\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b371-5\">Thus, in. the indictment against the thief and receiver, jointly, which averred that the thief feloniously \u201c did steal, take and carry \u201d the goods, and that the second feloniously received the goods, knowing them \u201c to have been feloniously stolen, taken and carried <em>away </em>as aforesaid,\u201d the omission of the word \u201c <em>away,\" </em>was held fatal in arrest of judgment, not only with reference to the thief, but the receiver. It was held that, although the word <em>away was supplied in the subsequent averment, which alleged that the receiver, 11 well knowing it to have been stolen, taken and carried away,\" yet, inasmuch as this material word was left out in the averment which charged the stealing, that the judgment should be arrested with reference to the receiver as well as the thief.

In delivering their opinion, the court say: \u201c Look into the indictment, and let it be asked with what criminal act does it charge the prisoner ? It is answered in the argument, that by looking into the whole context, and taking into view the concluding averment, 1 <em>that at the time of the </em>uttering, <em>Sc., the prisoner well knew' </em>&amp;c., what was intended, sufficiently appears to answer all the purposes for which certainty is required. <em>The averment refers to the preceding, and you must look to that to determine its </em>meaning.\u201d [So in the case of Shay. If the third averment setting forth the fatal blows given to deceased, fails to allege that Shay gave those blows <em>with </em>\u201c a certain knife \u201d\u2014and there is no pretence that he gave them in any other way\u2014the expression in the subsequent part of the count, \u201c giving unto the said John Leary, then and there, with the knife aforesaid,\u201d * * - \u201c one mortal wound,\u201d does not cure the difficulty, because, in the language of the court cited, \u201c <em>this averment refers to the preceding, and you must look to that to determine its mean</em>ing.\u201d] The court in their opinion continue as follows: \u201cNothing ought, therefore, to be left to conjecture.

The only offence of which this witness was claimed to have been convicted, was that of petit larceny, for which he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>was sentenced to the House of Eefuge. This being a first offence, was not a felony, and the sentence thereupon did not disqualify Mm as a witness. <em>(Carpenter </em>v.

The point whether or not petit larceny is yet a felony at common law, discussed in <em>Ward </em>v. <em>People </em>(3 <em>Hill, </em>398), has no bearing upon this question, as is expressly ruled in <em>Carpenter </em>v. <em>Nixon, </em>above cited. Nor does the subsequent case of <em>The People </em>v. <em>Adler </em>(3 <em>Park. Cr.

S., </em>701, \u00a7 23, <em>orig. </em>ed.), bases the incompetency of a witness only upon a sentence upon a \u201cconviction for felony,\u201d and further declares that \u201c no sentence upon aeon viction for any offence other than a felony shall disqualify and the same act (\u00a7 30), declares that \u201c the term felony, when used in this act or in any other statute, shall be construed to mean an offence for which the offender, on conviction, shall be liable by law to be punished by death, or by imprisonment in a State Prison.\u201d In no case can a person, convicted for the first time of petit larceny, be now sentenced to a State Prison.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"141\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b374-7\">II. The question was properly allowed. The defence'sought to show by the witness that he discovered on the morning of the homicide that the prisoner\u2019s hat was cut, for the purpose of an inference that the cut had just been made by a weapon in the hand of the deceased; and it was clearly proper to show that the prisoner and a third person had fought with knives a few days previous, when the cut might have been made. The inference in one case would have been as warrantable as in the other.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"142\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b374-8\">HI. On a cross-examination, the question was undoubtedly proper. The point as to the cut was material to the issue, and the question might be a foundation for impeaching the witness, to be followed by further questions, and then by showing that he had made a contradictory statement to another person.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"143\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b374-9\">IV. If the question was improper, the difficulty was cured by the answer. It elicited no testimony, and the rule is well settled that an exception will not be available to an improper question, when it does no harm.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"144\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b375-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>V. The indictment clearly describes the offence, to wit, that of murder; and everything necessary to constitute it is positively stated. In no way can the indictment be read, so as to fail to describe the offence, and every essential thereto, or so as to leave any doubt in respect to either.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"145\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b375-5\">1. This is rendered more clear by omitting the clause concerning the knife, which it is claimed that the word \u201c with \u201d should precede; in which case the indictment would read, \u201c and that the said M. S., him, the said J.L., in and upon the forehead, then and there willfully and feloniously, and of his malice aforethought, did beat, strike, stab, cut and wound; giving unto the said J. L., then and there, with the knife aforesaid, in and upon the forehead of him, the said J. L., one mortal wound,\u201d &amp;c. So read, it will be seen that the only use or effect of the omitted words, \u201c a certain knife which he, the said M. S., in his right hand then and there had and held,\u201d is to describe the knife, and the manner of holding it, and this may be considered as done by way of parenthesis.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"146\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b375-6\">VI.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"A__\">At the last Oyer and Terminer, held in this city, the prisoner, Mortimer Shay, was tried on an indictment for the alleged murder of one John Leary, arid was convicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-8\">The case comes before this court by writ of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-9\">On the trial, among other witnesses, one Stephen' Leary was called and sworn as a witness on the part of the People, and the testimony which he gave was material to the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-10\">It appearing that Stephen Leary had previously been convicted of petit larceny at a Court of General Sessions of the Peace, held in and for the city and county of New York, by a copy of the record of his conviction, properly certified and introduced in evidence by the counsel for the prisoner, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>counsel for the prisoner thereupon moved that the evidence of the said Stephen Leaiy be stricken out.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">The court denied such motion, and refused to strike out such evidence; and the counsel for the prisoner then and there duly excepted to such refusal of the judge to strike out Stephen Leary\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">The first question presented by the writ of error, is, did the judge err in refusing to strike out this testimony? or, in other words, was Stephen Leary a competent witness, notwithstanding his previous conviction of petit larceny ?</p>\n<p id=\"b376-7\">The three chapters constituting the fourth part of the Be-vised Statutes, were passed as one act. That act is entitled <em>\u201c </em>An act concerning crimes and punishments,\u201d &amp;c.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-8\">By section one of title six of chapter one of that act (2 <em>R. S., </em>690), petit larceny is defined to be the \u201c stealing, taking or carrying away the personal property of another, of the value of twenty-five dollars or underand that section declares that the punishment of petit larceny shall be \u201c imprisonment in a county jail not exceeding six months, or by fine not exceeding one hundred dollars, or by both such fine and imprisonment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b376-9\">Section twenty-three of title seven of the same chapter (2 <em>R. </em>S., 701), declares that \u201cno person sentenced upon a conviction for felony, shall be competent to testify in any cause, matter or proceeding, civil or criminal, unless pardoned,\u201d &amp;c. ; but that \u201c no sentence, upon a conviction for any offence other than a felony, shall disqualify or render any person incompetent to be sworn or to testify in any cause, matter or proceeding, civil or criminal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b376-10\">Section thirty of the same title, seven (2 <em>R. S., </em>702), declares that \u201c the term felony, when <em>used in this act, </em>or in any other statute, shall be construed to mean an offence for which the offender, on conviction, shall be liable by law to be punished by death or by imprisonment in a State Prison.\"</p>\n<p id=\"b376-11\">It would appear to follow so clearly and conclusively from \u2022these statutory provisions and definitions, that Stephen Leary was a competent witness in this case, notwithstanding his previous conviction of petit larceny, and that the judge did right <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>in refusing to strike out his evidence; that it is difficult to see how even a question could be raised on that point. One provision of the act is, that no conviction for any offence other than a felony, shall disqualify or render any person incompetent to be sworn or to testify; and another provision of the same act defines the word <em>11 felony f when used in the </em>act, to be an offence punishable by death or imprisonment in a State Prison; and by a third provision of the same act, the offence of petit larceny is defined; and it is declared to be punishable, not by death or imprisonment in a State Prison, but by fine or imprisonment in a county jail, or by both such fine and imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">It follows so plainly from these statutory provisions that Stephen Leary was a competent witness, notwithstanding his previous conviction of petit larceny, that one would hardly look for, or expect to find, an authority outside the statute on that point.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">The case of <em>The People </em>v. <em>Adler </em>(3 <em>Park. Cr. R., </em>249), does not at all interfere with this plain construction of the statute. That case decides only that the definition of the word felony, in the Revised Statutes, applies only where the word is used in a statute, leaving petit larceny still a felony as at common law, <em>\u201c </em>in respect to all questions controlled solely by the common law.\u201d The question in <em>The People </em>v. <em>Adler </em>was such a question, unaffected by the statutory definition.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-7\">On the cross-examination, by the District Attorney, of Thaddeus Spencer, a witness called and sworn for the prisoner, the District Attorney put this question to the witness: Do you know that the prisoner had a cutting match with any one previous to the killing of Leary ?</p>\n<p id=\"b377-8\">The witness was allowed to answer this question, after objection by the counsel for the prisoner. The answer was: I do not.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-9\">As the answer could not possibly prejudice the prisoner, it is unnecessary to inquire whether the question in reference to the testimony which had been given by the witness on his direct examination, was or was not proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>The remaining question in this case is raised on the face of the indictment. That question is, whether the indictment, in charging the offence, sets forth with sufficient particularity and certainty the manner of the death, and the means by which it was effected ? The counsel for the prisoner insists that the indictment is fatally defective in this respect, and does not charge the crime of murder within the rules of criminal pleading, and therefore moves that the judgment be arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">The indictment, after alleging in the usual manner that the prisoner, on a certain day, at the first ward in the city of New York, with force, &amp;c., on and upon John Leary, willfully, feloniously, &amp;c., did make an assault, and then proceeds as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-6\">\u201cAnd that the said Mortimer Shay, a certain knife, which he, the said Mortimer Shay, in his right hand then and there had and held, him, the said John Leary, in and upon the forehead, then and there willfully and feloniously, and of his malice aforethought, did beat, strike, stab, cut and wound, giving unto the said John Leary, then and there, <em>with the Jcnife aforesaid,' </em>in and upon the forehead of him, the said John Leary, one mortal wound, of the breadth of one inch, and of the depth of three inches, of which mortal wound, he, the said John Leary,\u201d &amp;c.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b378-7\">The counsel for the prisoner insists that-the evidently clerical mistake in the omission 'of the word <em>with, </em>before the description of the weapon, renders the indictment fatally defective ; that although the indictment alleges that the fatal wound was given with the knife, yet that in consequence -of the omission of the word <em>with </em>before the word <em>hnife, </em>in the preceding portion of the indictment, it is not alleged that the fatal <em>blow </em>or <em>stab, </em>&amp;c., which caused the mortal wound, was given with the knife;. that it does not appear, nor is it alleged, that the knife caused the mortal wound.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-8\">Now, without examining the authorities cited by the counsel for the prisoner, to show the particularity required in an indictment for murder, in setting forth the manner of the death and the means by which it was effected, and conceding for the purposes of this question, that the indictment in this case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>should have substantially alleged that the mortal blow or stab was struck or made with the knife, yet I think this indictment does in fact so substantially allege. The indictment distinctly and certainly alleges three things: 1st. That the prisoner then and there had and held in his right hand a certain knife. 2d. That he did then and there beat, strike, stab, cut and wound the deceased. 3d. That he then and there gave unto the deceased, on and upon his forehead, with the knife aforesaid, one mortal wound, &amp;c.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">Now is not this substantially alleging that the blow, stab, &amp;c., were given <em>with </em>the knife ?</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">It is certainly plainly alleged that the prisoner struck the deceased, having in his right hand a knife, and that he gave the mortal wound with the knife. Is not this substantially alleging that the prisoner struck the deceased with the knife, and that the knife Caused the mortal wound ? I think it is, and that the death, and the means, and the manner in and by. which it was effected by the prisoner, are sufficiently and certainly charged in the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-7\">In my opinion the judgment of the Oyer and Terminer should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-8\">Judgment affirmed.<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b379-9\"> The following opinion was given by Judge Ingraham, on a motion in arrest of judgment in this case, made on the ground of the clerical omission in the indictment:</p>\n<p id=\"b379-10\">Ingraham, J. In this case the prisoner has been tried and convicted of mur.der. Ho objection was taken on the trial, or previous thereto, to the form of the indictment. A motion is now made on behalf of the prisoner in arrest of judgment for the omission of the word \u201c with \u201d in the indictment, before the description of the weapon used by the prisoner. The mistake is evidently a clerical one; but still, if material to charging the offence, would be available. The clause in the indictment reads as follows: \u201c That the said Mortimer Shay,-a certain knife which he, the said Mortimer Shay, in his right hand then and there had and held, him, the said John Leary, in and upon the forehead, then and there willfully and feloniously, and of his malice aforethought, did beat, strjke, stab, cut and wound, giving unto 'the said John Leary, then and there, with the knife <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>aforesaid, in and upon the forehead of the said John Leary, one mortal wound,\u201d &amp;c. I cannot conclude that the omission of the word \u201cwith,\u201d before the words \u201c a certain knife,\u201d is such a defect in substance as to warrant granting this motion. The indictment would read so as to charge the offence, if those words were included in a parenthesis\u2014\u201c That the said Mortimer Shay (he the said Shay then holding a knife in his hand), did stab, beat, strike and wound the said Leary, and giving unto the said Leary, then and there with the knife aforesaid, a mortal wound,\u201d &amp;c. The offence is fully stated without the word omitted; and although it is necessary to name the weapon with which the death was effected, the indictment sufficiently shows it, notwithstanding the omission of the word complained of. The cases cited by the prisoner\u2019s counsel are none of them applicable to this case. They relate to cases where the defect was in charging the offence; here it is merely in relation to the weapon with which the offence was committed, and in that respect the objection is remedied by the subsequent part of the count in the indictment, which charges expressly that the wound was given with the knife, and that of such wound the deceased died. It seems to me that the offence is fully charged in the indictment, notwithstanding the omission of this word, and if so, it becomes a mere error in matters of form, which is cured by the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-9\">Motion denied.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
