The opening of the testimony in that stage of the case rests in the discretion of the court.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b396-8\">The objection that the judgment record does not show the prisoner to have been present in court during the whole of the trial, nor at the rendition of the verdict, is not available on error when it appears by the record that he was personaEy present at the impanneling of the jury and when the judgment was rendered, and when the return of the minutes of the court, made to a writ of <em>certiorari, </em>shows that the jurors were poEed on giving their verdict, and that the prisoner was present on every day of the trial previous to the rendering of the verdict.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b396-9\">Exceptions to the exclusion of documentary evidence, though weE taken, are not available where such documents were admitted in evidence at a subsequent stage of the trial.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b396-10\">Exceptions to the rejection of questions put to a witness, though weE taken, are not available on error, where it appears that the counsel making the objection, while the witness was still in court, and before the opposite party had closed his case, withdrew his objections, and consented that aE the questions which had been excluded might be put to the witness and answered by him.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b396-11\">A judgment wEl not be reversed on the ground of the admission on the trial of impertinent and immaterial evidence, if such evidence was harmless.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b396-12\">It is competent to ask a physician, on his cross-examination, to give his opinion ' whether certain symptoms, particularly specified, were those of arsenical poisoning, when the witness has previously given testimony in relation to the same subject matter, and where the symptoms inquired about are the same of which evidence had been previously given by another witness.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b396-13\">Where immaterial evidence has been taken without objection, it is too late after-wards to object to its effect, and it is not erroneous to refuse to strike it out.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b396-14\">Whether, after the defence\u2019has rested, the prosecution shaU be permitted to call a witness in support of previous testimony, is a matter of discretion in the court, not reviewable on error.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b397-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>An anonymous letter, proved to have heen written by the prisoner and sent to S. 0., reflecting upon the character of S. B., a young lady of whom S. 0. was the suitor, was held admissible in evidence against the prisoner, on a question of motive, on a trial for murder of the prisoner\u2019s wife by poisoning, it being charged, and there being circumstances tending strongly to show, that the object of the prisoner in committing the alleged murder, was to enable him to marry S. B.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b397-5\">The expression, by the court, of an opinion upon the weight of evidence, in charging the jury, is not ground of error, when the court also told the jury they were the judges of all questions of fact, and that they were to determine them without reference to any opinion expressed by the court.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b397-6\">Symptoms of poisoning by arsenic, and of the appearances on <em>post-mortem </em>examination in cases of death by poison, as described by witnesses and proved by eminent physicians and chemists.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b397-7\">Circumstantial evidences of guilt on a trial for murder by poisoning with arsenic.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b397-8\">Charge to the jury of Mr. Justice Roosevelt, on the trial before the Court of Oyer and Terminer.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b397-9\">The following propositions, charged by the judge on the trial, were affirmed by the court:</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b397-10\">1. The counsel for the prosecution having read to the medical witnesses certain symptoms from a paper marked by the judge, and inquired their opinion as to the cause of death in a case where such symptoms existed, if the jury believe that the symptoms of which Mrs. S. (the person alleged to have been poisoned), complained in her lifetime, are not in all respects the symptoms stated in the paper read to the physicians, that then the medical opinions are not admissible as competent evidence to be weighed by the jury, and cannot be taken into consideration.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b397-11\">2. If the jury are of opinion that the body of Mrs. S., after being exhumed for analysis, was so exposed that access could be had to it by other parties than those who made the <em>post-mortem </em>examination of the body and conducted the chemical analysis, nnder such circumstances that they could have applied arsenic to it, and particularly if they believe that R. B., one of the witnesses for the prosecution, who first charged the prisoner with poisoning his wife, actually had access to the body and tampered with it, so much of the analysis as was made after the body was so exposed and tampered with, is not competent evidence against the prisoner, and should be disregarded by the jury.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b397-12\">3. Where a prisoner is charged with the commission of a crime, and evidence of good character is introduced by him, which is not controverted on the part of the People, such evidence is to be considered by the jury, and is not merely of value in doubtful cases, but will of itself sometimes create a doubt when, without it, none could exist; and if good character be proved to the satifsaction of the jury, it should produce an acquittal, even in cases where the whole evidence slightly preponderated against the accused.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b397-13\">4. When a charge depends upon circumstantial evidence, it ought not only to be consistent with the prisoner\u2019s guilt, but inconsistent with any other rational conclusion.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b398-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>5. If the jury, upon considering the whole of the evidence, have a reasonable doubt of the guilt of the defendant of the offence charged in the indictment, it is their duty to acquit.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b398-5\">6. If the jury believe that R. B. attempted to assassinate the prisoner before his arrest upon the charge of poisoning his wife, and that he entertained feelings of animosity and hatred towards him, and if the jury believe that S. and E. B. are also hostile towards the prisoner, and have quarrelled with him, that then they should consider these matters in weighing the degree of credit which is to be given to their testimony.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b398-6\">Eorm of a writ of <em>certiorwri </em>to the Oyer and Terminer to bring up certain papers not constituting a part of the judgment record.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b398-7\">This case came before this court on a writ of error directed to the New York Oyer and Terminer; in return to which writ the clerk of such court returned the following record of conviction : <em>wm</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b398-8\">\n<em>City and County of Neto York, ss:</em>\n</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b398-9\">Be it remembered, that at a Court of General Sessions of the Peace, holden at the City Hall, of the city of New York, in and for the city and county of New York, on the first Monday of December, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and fifty-eight, before George G.

she was a great deal debilitated; she said very little to me, and I do not recollect any of her words; I did not hear her complain of thirst, but from the other symptoms she must have been thirsty; I did not suspect at the time that arsenic had been administered; she had inflammation of the stomach, I have no doubt; the effect of arsenic is to cause inflammation of the stomach; I recollect my first prescription; it is dated the 18th of September, 1857; my last visit was made about thirty-six or forty hours before Mrs. Stephens\u2019 death; I gave a certificate of the cause of her death; I stated it to be inflammation of the stomach.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b404-7\">The witness, among other things, further testifies as follows: I understood that Mrs. Stephens had been sick some two weeks when I first visited her; I so understood from the prisoner, I think; I do not recollect how long she had been con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>fined to her bed; I am sure that I visited her as many as three times; I prescribed for her upon my first visit; I recollect only one prescription afterward; the prescriptions were put up at Shipley &amp; Vanderhoof\u2019s.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b405-5\">(Here a book purporting to be the prescription book of Shipley &amp;

it is for a Spanish fly blister; I distinctly recollect prescribing this for Mrs. Stephens; there is also an ointment of simple cerate and morphine; the blister is numbered 3824, and the ointment 3825; the next prescription given by me is numbered 3851; it is morphine and sugar, and was ordered by me on the 21st of September, but I have no recollection of ordering it for Mrs. Stephens; it reads: \u201c1 grain morphine, and white sugar 10 grains, to be divided into four powders;\u201d I ordered the blister to be applied to the pit of the stomach, to stop the pain, vomiting, &amp;c.; her symptoms on my second visit were about the same as on the first; I stopped visiting Mrs. Stephens because I was told that I was not wanted; that there was no necessity for me to come again; I cannot say positively I was so told by the prisoner, but it is my impression that he told me; I have no recollection of at any time prescribing laudanum for Mrs. Stephens; I am as certain that I did not as I can be of anything; it is not my habit to do such a thing; I prescribed some lager beer to her at my last visit; I did not prescribe brandy for her at all; I gave a certificate that she died of inflammation of the stomach; I <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>last saw her thirty-six or forty hours before her death;

if a person had taken several doses of arsenic, there would most likely be serious burning in the throat, and also at the pit of the stomach; the eyes appear sunken from the swelling under the lids; I did not see the body after death; the prescriptions I testified about on my direct examination, did not contain any iron, nor any adulteration of arsenic, and if put up as ordered there was no arsenic in them; there is no adulteration of quinine by arsenic that I know of; Fanny Bell was present at my visits to Mrs. Stephens ; I was examined as a witness before the coroner; so far as I know, I was asked if Mr. Stephens made use of any expressions about his wife other than that she was ill, and so far as I know I answered that he did not, that he was only anxious about her health; I said at the coroner\u2019s inquest that I had not then any suspicions that she was poisoned.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b406-6\">The <em>direct examination </em>of the witness being resumed, he testified, among other thing, as follows: I have never seen either Sophia or Fanny Bell at my office;

(The prescription book shown to Dr. Ire-monger being also shown to this witness, he further testified as follows:) All the prescriptions we put up from written prescriptions for the month of September, 1857, were entered in this book;

I remember when the prisoner and my aunt were married; it was about ten or eleven years since; I remember their leaving Ireland to come to this country ; it was about two or three years before I came; I came to this country with Mrs. and Miss Francis; after arriving here I went to board, and the prisoner came for me and took me to his house; after which I wrote to my father how kind the prisoner and his wife had been to me; and my father then wrote to me that I should be guided by them in every way; I remained in their family from three to five months, as near as I can remember; since I came to this country I have been a seamstress, and am at present a dressmaker; prior to my aunt\u2019s sickness I worked at my trade in this city; my aunt died at Ho. 166 East Twenty-seventh street; at the time of her death the prisoner\u2019s family consisted of himself, his wife and his daughter; and my sister and myself also lived with them; it was a three-story house, and the prisoner occupied the third floor, consisting of four rooms; Dr. Cadmus first attended my aunt during her last sickness; I saw him at the prisoner\u2019s house twice; his first call was in the forenoon; my aunt was out to market when he arrived; he called at the suggestion of the prisoner-; my aunt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>was complaining of an affection in the chest, a burning, and the prisoner said he would have to send for the doctor; she said \u201c Never mind the doctor at present,\u201d as she thought he was not required; he insisted upon the doctor\u2019s coming; she went to market, and when the doctor came I told him where she was gone; I suppose the prisoner went after him, because he said he would send him around, and then left the house; my aunt told the doctor she thought something was the matter with her lungs, and wanted him to examine them ;\u2022 he said he could not conveniently then examine them, as he had no instruments with him, but that if she would come round to his office he would examine her chest; he came the next day and examined her chest and lungs; he did not prescribe for her that day; he said that if some person would come .around, he would give her something; he thought there was nothing the matter with her chest; Mrs. Stephens was large and very stout; she weighed a hundred and sixty pounds two or three months before her death; before her last sickness, she did the work of her own family; before Dr. Cadmus made these calls, I had never seen a doctor there, except when Mrs. Stephens was confined at the birth of her child, about seven years ago; the child was born the day before I arrived, as I understood; when I arrived I saw Dr. Cadmus attending on my aunt; I think Dr. Iremonger attended my aunt the greater part of the last week previous to her death; between Dr. Cadmus attending her and Dr. Iremonger\u2019s calling, she was complaining; she would be a part of the day in bed and part of the day up ; she appeared to grow worse while Dr. Iremonger was attending her; after Dr. Cadmus had stopped calling she still complained of the burning; she said it seemed like a ball of fire rolling; she' would feel it in her stomach, and sometimes up in her throat, and she said she thought she could put her finger down her throat and feel it; I heard her complaining of the heat in her chest previous to Dr. Cadmus coming: but the burning still grew worse, 'and increased till she died; I did not hear her use the words \u201c ball of fire,\" until after she was confined to her bed; about the time that Dr. Iremonger first visited her, I heard her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>use this expression, \u201c ball of fire,\u201d frequently, to almost every person who came in; she said frequently in my hearing that if she would neither eat nor drink she would be better; after eating and drinking she vomited severely, and there was a great deal of pain for her to vomit; she had to catch hold of the bed and strain herself very hard when vomiting; sometimes she vomited immediately after eating, and sometimes a long time would elapse before vomiting; she did not always vomit directly after eating; I do not know what she eat after her sickness, for I was there only a part of the time; I was working in Fifty-second street, between Fourth and Fifth avenues, at dressmaking; my sister, Fanny Bell, attended on her during her sickness; I remained at home two or three days, all day, with her, because she was much worse on the mornings of those days; it was while Dr. Iremonger was visiting her; I saw Mr. Stephens give her drinks\u2014tea, lager beer, lemonade, buttermilk and coffee; I saw him give her no other kind of drinks; I saw him give her pills first, after Dr. Cad-mus had called; he gave her laudanum two or three times in her drinks; my aunt was moaning, and Stephens said he would give her a little laudanum so that she might go to sleep and feel better when she awoke; he gave her this in lager beer or tea about a week before she died; on the afternoon preceding my aunt\u2019s death, when I returned from work, I went into the room to see my aunt; it was dark; my aunt was lying on the bed and breathing very, hard; Stephens was in the room alone with my aunt; he was giving her something out of a tumbler, and told me to leave the room, which I did, and he shut the door; he told me my aunt was asleep; I was confused and frightened, for she was breathing so hard, and I returned to the room in a few minutes; Stephens was sitting in a chair by her bed; Mr. and Mrs. Pullman called; I went into the sitting room where they were, and I could hear my aunt breathing in that room; Mrs. Pullman told me not to let my aunt remain so long in that condition, as she would be exhausted, and I must wake her up; I remained in the sitting room until they left; it was raining very hard at the time; I <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>then run into my aunt\u2019s room, got her in my arms, pulled her up in the bed, and said I was determined to speak to her once more; I then shook her; when she woke she said to me, \u201c Where have you been all day, that you have not been to see me?\u201d she put her arms around me, and said she was going to die, and wished me to take care of her child; she said, where-ever I was, if I possibly could, I must see her child and take care of her; she committed her to my care-; she asked to see my sister Fanny, and Fanny came in; she then folded her arms round Fanny, and said she hoped we would both meet her in heaven; that she was going to die, and felt happy; she asked my sister and me to sing for her,' and we did; this was about nine o\u2019clock, as near as I can remember; while we were singing, Mr. Armstrong, a class leader in Twenty-seventh street church, came in and prayed with my aunt; then the prisoner and his sister, Mrs. Susan Hannah, and her daughter, Maria Hannah, came in; previous to their coming in, I was obliged to ask Mr. Armstrong to leave the room, because my aunt was vomiting, and then her bowels began to change; my aunt died about three o\u2019clock, Wednesday morning, 23d of September, 1857; I was not in the room when my aunt died; I was- in the sitting room; Mr. Davis came in that evening; several times in the course of the evening my aunt vomited a good deal, and had discharges from her bowels; at different times said she felt quite numb, without hardly any feeling on one side; frequently, when discharges came from her bowels, she would ask me to raise her up; the only means I had to raise her was to get upon the bed and raise her up in that way; the last time she was raised, and as she was about to be laid back, she gave an awful shriek, which frightened me; Mr. Stephens and Mrs. Hannah wished to keep her still, so I left the room and went into the sitting room; the lamp was taken out of her room, and the room was kept dark until she died; Mrs. Hannah and my sister, Fanny Bell, I think, were in her room when she died; while Mrs. Hannah and I were laying her out, about a quart of black liquid altogether came from her mouth; she was lying upon her back upon the floor when the first came <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>out, and wnen she was turned over upon her side it came more freely from her mouth; between nine and ten o\u2019clock she put her arms around the prisoner\u2019s neck and told him she was going to die, and wished him to meet her in heaven; when we were laying my aunt out, we removed a chesty standing on legs, about one foot long, for the purpose of having more room; I found a tumbler under this chest, and examined it; there was a very little liquid in it, and it smelled of laudanum; I had taken laudanum myself frequently before this time, and was acquainted with the smell of it; on Tuesday morning preceding my aunt\u2019s death, about seven or seven and a half o\u2019clock, A. M., as I was going out to work, Mr. Stephens told me to stop at Dr. Iremonger\u2019s, and tell him not to come again till he was sent for; if he was wanted again, he, Mr. Stephens, would call for him; I told Mr. Stephens I would not do it; he then took his hat, left the room, and said he would go and tell him himself; when I went down stairs on my way to work, Mr. Stephens was standing on the stoop; he again asked me to stop on my way, and tell Dr. Iremonger not to come; I told him I would not\u2014that I was going to ride; when I left the house he was standing on the stoop, and I took the Third avenue car; prior to my aunt\u2019s last sickness, Stephens refused to take her to any place, and spoke roughly to her; he did not treat her as a husband should treat a wife; he would frequently, tell her to hush up, would speak roughly to her, and I heard him say he wished she was dead; this was two or three months before my aunt\u2019s death; he very commonly used such expressions as I have before stated to her; he commenced using this language some time previous to her death; I noticed it more particularly about ten or twelve months before her death; when I first came to this country, his conduct was very good towards her, in my estimation; my aunt\u2019s age at the time of her death was 46 years; Mr. Stephens\u2019 age was 32 years, as he said in my hearing, but I do not otherwise know his age; at the time of my aunt\u2019s death, I was receiving the addresses of Mr. Samuel Cardwell, real estate agent and dry goods merchant; his store is 496 Third avenue; the first I ever spoke to him was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>at a Sabbath School pic-nic of the Twenty-seventh street Methodist Church, in the summer of 1857; he commenced visiting me at my aunt\u2019s residence, in the summer before her death; he called upon me there frequently; after my aunt\u2019s death, about a month, Mr. Stephens said to me that he wished me to remain at his house, and not go out to work any more, as I had been out to work long enough; he also said that he would like to get engaged to me, as there were other young ladies m the Third avenue who would like him to pay attention to them, and he did not wish to affront them; I have frequently seen Mr. Stephens write, and am well acquainted with his handwriting ; after my aunt\u2019s death, a day was fixed for my marriage with Mr. Cardwell; I cannot tell the month; it was in the summer of 1848; we were to be married in the Twenty-seventh street Methodist Church; the time fixed was the day after Mr. Cardwell received an anonymous letter; our intention to be married at that time was known to a great many; we were not married at the time fixed, because of the anonymous letter; Mr. Stephens had written to Mr. Cardwell the day previous; I have seen that letter. ' (The letter is shown to the witness, who testified further): This is the letter; this is in the prisoner\u2019s handwriting.; Mr. Cardwell and myself have not yet been married; upon the receipt of this letter, Mr. Cardwell, my brother, Robert Bell, and myself, went to Chester, in Orange county, and remained a short time; I never saw Mrs. Stephens vomit before her last sickness; she vomited a good deal; she would vomit about half a basin full at a time; the vomited matter was of different colors; sometimes it was yellowish, at other times dark; I was present myself when she vomited on some occasions; I remember her vomiting once when Dr, Iremonger was there; Mr. Stephens was present many times when she vomited; I did not particularly notice the smell of the vomited matter; Mr. Stephens frequently emptied the vomited matter from the basin into the slop pail; Mr. Stephens several times carried the basin containing the vomited matter to the window; he asked me once or twice to look at it; there was something like little red spots in it, which he thought was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>some of her liver; the way he examined the contents of the basin was to turn it up one side, then took a straw and drew what appeared to be little pieces of flesh up against the side of the basin; she complained of pain in her breast and burning once to Dr. Iremonger, when he ordered a blister; this was Sunday previous to her death; she complained of extreme thirst about two weeks before her death\", and as I noticed, down to the time of her death; the morning before her death, as I left the house, she was complaining of thirst; I did not notice her unusual drowsiness until the night previous to her death; on the Sunday previous to her death, her eyes were very sharp looking; I mean by sharp looking, that when she looked at you she looked very sharp ; after her confinement to her bed, her countenance looked a little excitable sometimes, and at other times she looked careworn and fatigued; I heard her complain of coldness of her feet about a week before she died; she said her feet and legs felt cold; she would frequently close her hands, and said they felt queer, and she could not tell what was the matter with them; the night before she died she said her whole side was numb; she said she did not have any power in her hands or arms; two or three days before her death she complained of cramps, but I cannot say particularly what she said; she said she thought it queer that her feet and legs were continually cold, and asked Fanny Bell to put a warm iron to her feet to keep her warm; she complained of cold perspiration on her hands, and always kept throwing her arms outside of the clothes; while she was confined to her bed she had suppression of the urine; before her sickness her lips were thin and had fallen in by reason of the loss of teeth, but on the Sunday preceding her death, I noticed that her lips were swollen, and asked Dr. Iremonger if he noticed it; he said not particularly; after he left the house she examined her face in a looking glass, and said I was right, that her lips were swollen ; the discharge on the evening previous to her death produced an offensive smell; it looked very dark on Tuesday morning; it seemed to me as if it was mixed with blood; the evening before her death her eyes looked very sharp at every <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>person at whom she looked; she gave that horrible scream of which I have spoken, about 11 o\u2019clock at night; I did not see her converse with any one after that, but she fell into a stupor, and so remained until she died; before she screamed she had a laughing expression of countenance, and talked to me about Mr. Cardwell, laughingly; the discharges from her bowels were accompanied with pain in her bowels;, during her sickness she had a suppression of menstruation; William Knox is \u00e1 cousin of mine; after Mrs. Stephens\u2019 death, a short time, William Knox came into the bedroom of myself and sister Fanny, and lay across the foot of the bed; at the first opportunity after that, I asked Mr. Stephens why he had sent William Knox into our room, and he said he could ruin our characters in the estimation of the public at large, if I and my sister left his house; William Knox did not get into our bed; he lay across the foot of it; when he first came into the room, I asked him where he was going, and he said Mr. Stephens had told him to come in there; when I accused Mr. Stephens of sending Knox there, he did not deny it; I could almost say that Mr. Stephens said that he told William Knox to go to our room; I told Mr. Stephens that William Knox had said that he had sent him there, and Mr. Stephens did not make any reply; when Stephens cast it up to me and my sister, that Knox had been lying on our bed, I told him that he had sent Knox there for his own purpose, and that William Knox told us that he had sent him to our room, and Mr. Stephens did not deny it; we remained at Mr. Stephens\u2019 house about six months after my aunt\u2019s death; when we left, we went to board with Mrs. Sherman, in Third avenue; when my brother, Robert Bell, arrived here, last July, I was at Mrs. Levy\u2019s in the Bowery, and my sister Fanny lived there with me; since Mr. Stephens\u2019 arrest, my sister and myself have boarded at 69 Third avenue; immediately after my aunt\u2019s death, my sister and myself talked of leaving; we wanted to get another place to live in; Mr. Stephens objected to myself and sister leaving, all the time and every way that he could, up to the time that we left; when Mr. Knox lay across the foot of our bed, he did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>not undress himself; he did not get into the bed at all, but lay outside of the bed; I came home on the evening preceding my aunt\u2019s death, between seven and eight o\u2019clock, and found Mr. Stephens in her room; he shortly after left her room, and remained in the sitting room a short time, and then went after Mrs. Hannah; he came back very soon with her; Mrs. Hannah\u2019s daughter came with them; while he was gone, I took a light into my aunt\u2019s room and saw something dark on the side of her mouth; I went to Greenwood cemetery when my aunt was buried; I saw her buried; I was present when her body was exhumed by the coroner; Mr. Cardwell and my sister were present; when the body was exhumed at Greenwood cemetery, the coffin was opened, and I recognized the body of my aunt; we accompanied the coroner to Bellevue Hospital, where he deposited the body in the dead house; and when the cof\u00edn was opened on the occasion of the <em>post-mortem </em>examination, I again identified it; before my aunt\u2019s death; and on the day of Mrs. John Stephenson\u2019s funeral, my aunt wanted to go to the funeral; Mr. Stephens refused to let her go; she insisted upon going; he struck her, and gave her a black eye; my aunt cried out that he was murdering her; the flesh became black afterward around the eye where he struck her; her eye continued discolored until she died; I never mixed any medicine that was administered to Mrs. Stephens; when Mr. Stephens proposed to marry me, about a month after my aunt\u2019s death, he said I could have him now as there was no barrier in the way; and when I spoke of leaving, he said that would be treating the child very different from what my aunt requested me to do; I asked him to let the child come with me, and he refused.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b415-5\">\u25a0 Being <em>cross-examined, </em>this witness, among other things, testified as follows: When I arrived in this country I stopped at Mr. Stephens\u2019 house three, four or five months; I do not recollect the precise time; I did not return there to board until the spring before my aunt\u2019s death; but I called at his house almost every Sunday, and two or three times a week; I was then a seamstress, and went out to work in the day and came home <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>at night, except a few nights when it stormed; when Dr. Cad-mus first called on my aunt, she did not v^ant a physician; she said she did not need a physician then; she complained of an affection in her chest; Dr. Cadmus did not prescribe for her at his first visit; Dr. Iremonger was called in at my aunt\u2019s request; Mr. Stephens was constantly there when Dr. Iremonger called; there was a signal put up for him in the hall window (a white cloth), to bring him home; he'required my sister to put it there when my aunt wanted medicine, and when the doctor came; I never gave her any medicine; she said she would feel better if she would neither eat nor drink; I first noticed the diarrhea the morning before her death; there was one injection administered to her the Sunday before her death; I do not know that I -swore yesterday that I never saw her take anything that had laudanum in it; I know that he put laudanum in a drink and gave it to me to carry to her; the evening before her death I went into my aunt\u2019s bedroom; about the time of my going in, Mrs. Pullman came in; after I came I had some conversation with her; when I went in Mr. Stephens sat on the chair, with his elbows on his knees, and his head on his hands, and said she was asleep, and he thought she would feel better when she awoke; she breathed hard, and had a very queer expression on her face; it.was after dark; I could see from the light that.,stood in the sitting room; there was no light in the bedroom; Mrs. Pullman said, \u201c Do not let her lie long in that position, she will be soon \"exhausted;\u201d after Mr. and Mrs. Pullman left I awoke her; I told Mr. Stephens I was going to; he said he thought I had better not yet awhile; I said I was determined to speak to her once more before she died, and I would wake her up ; when I talked to her she would go off to sleep, and I kept shaking her; I heard her say she hoped he (Mr. Stephens) woidd prepare to meet her in heaven; he did not like to have her go with him anywhere; he said everybody was laughing at him because she was so much older than he; he said they called her his mother; it was not agreeable to Mr. Stephens that Mr. Cardwell should visit me; he was decidedly opposed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>to our marriage; after the anonymous letter was received, Mr. Cardwell did not say he would not marry me; it was at my own request that the marriage was postponed; I did not wish to get married under the feelings that I then had; Mr. Stephens threatened to ruin our characters if we left him; Mr. Stephens attempted to commit a rape on me in the Fifth avenue; he did not succeed; he also attempted to commit a rape upon me at his house on Mew Year\u2019s eve, when I was sick; he went out with me a great many times; my aunt sent him along with me; she said she thought Mr. Stephens was my best guardian, and she said he was the best person I could trust myself with, as I had no friend here; when he asked me to marry him, I told him he must never again breathe such a thing in my presence ; when I saw Mrs. Stephens at the time of her exhumation, her face was discolored, yet I recognized it; I knew the clothes that I put around her neck before she was put into the coffin; if I had seen the body anywhere else I should have recognized it; my aunt\u2019s black eye was not occasioned by her falling against a chest, but she told me, that she hit it against the chest, to conceal Mr. Stephens\u2019 villainy; I saw him mix powders and give them to her; there were a good many circumstances to prevent our leaving Mr. Stephens\u2019 house sooner than we did; Mr. Stephens was in the habit of destroying all our letters, or doing as he pleased with them, and all the letters that I received from Mr. Cardwell came through him; if -I wrote to Mr. Cardwell, he would snatch up the letter and ask me if I would like to have it; he threatened to show them to Mr. Brandon and Mr. Mills; I was afraid to leave his house, for he said he would ruin my character and my sister\u2019s in the estimation of the people; that he would say such things about us as would excommunicate us from the church, and that he would ruin us in the city; the Twenty-seventh street church was about a block from Mr. Stephens\u2019 house.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b417-5\"><em>/Samuel </em>Cardwell, called upon the part of the People: I made an engagement to marry Miss Sophia Bell;

I went to the minister of the Second-street church, and found the minister at home; we were to go at 2 o\u2019clock next afternoon to his house; the night of the day I called upon the minister, I received an anonymous letter which prevented my marriage. (Letter previously shown to Sophia Bell shown to this witness.)

The counsel for the prisoner objected to the reading of said letter in evidence, for the reason and on the ground that the prisoner had a right to cross-examine the witness upon the question of its reception by him, and the facts connected therewith, and that the prisoner cannot be compelled to commence his cross-examination even upon this point until the prosecution had finished their examination in chief, and the witness is turned over to the prisoner for general examination.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b418-6\">The counsel for the prosecution here again offered the prisoner\u2019s counsel an opportunity to cross-examine the witness before the introduction and reading of the letter,which offer was declined.

I lived with the prisoner from the time I came to New York until after my aunt\u2019s death; I observed the conduct of the prisoner and wife towards each other; the prisoner\u2019s conduct towards his wife was not generally what I would expect from a husband; if she offered to give her advice, he always objected, and said she was not capable, and used harsh expressions towards her; he would tell her to hush up, that she did not know; that he knew better than she\u2014to dry up; sometimes he called her a fool and a liar, and said she was telling lies; she wanted to attend the funeral of John Stephenson\u2019s mother; she insisted upon attending the funeral with him ; he dressed himself; she wanted him to wait for her; he refused, and struck her, and she called murder; this occurred in the sitting room; Mrs. Stephens cried and held her handkerchief to one of her eyes; she said I was not to speak about the prisoner\u2019s striking her; immediately after receiving the blow, it looked red around the eye, and then green black; traces of this black remained until her death; the prisoner\u2019s conduct was generally rough; his language was rough; his treatment to my aunt was not such as a wife should receive; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>when she spoke to him about anything, he would put up his clothes and tell her he was going to go away and leave her;' I heard him wish that he had never seen her; I heard him wish that she was out of the way; I heard him once or twice wish that she was dead; this was about six weeks before she died; two or three times when he threatened to leave her, he had stopped out late, and when he came home he said he had a very pleasant time, and talked of the young ladies that were there; she talked about it, and was angry about it; then he packed up his clothes and. got them all ready to leave in the morning; my aunt\u2019s age was 46 at the time of her death; I heard him say he was 32 ; his bad treatment commenced about six months before my aunt\u2019s death, and grew worse until she died; the prisoner always went to the druggist\u2019s to have Dr. Iremonger\u2019s prescriptions filled; I saw the prisoner give my aunt powders and laudanum; he gave her powders the Monday evening before she died; she appeared a good deal better all that day, and when he returned with the powders she said that if she did not take any medicine she would soon get well; that every time she took the medicine she got worse, and said he would not leave the room until she took it; she took one that he prepared for her; then she vomited, and her bowels were changed; these\" powders were white and yellQW; they were in two papers and he mixed them; my aunt was in bed when he did this; some days before this time, he had four or six powders in a box; he put these powders in a closet, and they were there after aunt died; I never saw the prisoner bring powders into the house but twice; I first saw laudanum on the morning of Tuesday, the day before my aunt died ; it was an ounce vial, and labeled Shipley and Vanderhoof, corner of Thirty-third street and Third avenue; he poured the laudanum into drinks that he gave to Mrs. Stephens; my aunt was in bed at that time, and the prisoner was in the sitting room and the other room when he did this; he put this first ounce into lager beer and then in brandy, and gave it to her to drink; when this first vial was used up, he went out and returned with another bottle of laudanum; I saw him pouring <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>this laudanum into a glass with brandy; I asked him if this was laudanum he was giving her, and he said yes, that the doctor had ordered it; she objected to taking brandy, but he said the doctor told him to give her brandy for her bowels; the second bottle of laudanum was about the size of the first, and was labeled laudanum; it was from some drug store in Second avenue which I do not recollect; he administered this last bottle of laudanum' to my aunt in brandy; when this bottle was used up he went out and returned with half a pint of brandy, and a lager beer bottle of laudanum, without any label upon it; it was nearly half as large again as this other bottle of laudanum; when he came in with this laudanum I asked him if that was laudanum; he said yes; I asked him if laudanum would take a person\u2019s life; he said yes, but that the doctor had ordered it for her\u2014that it would not injure her, as her bowels were so bad; he said that the doctor had ordered it for her bowels, that it would ease the pain; he held this bottle of laudanum in 'his hands when he used these words ; he said this laudanum is strong enough to take the life of three men, but that it would not injure her; he procured this last laudanum between 12 and 1 o\u2019clock in the day; he gave this last bottle of laudanum in the last half pint of brandy; the first vial I saw about 9 o\u2019clock in the morning; the prisoner administered her medicines during her sickness; he did not stay home with her all day, except the day before her death ; he directed me to put a cloth as a signal when the doctor came, and when she was to get medicine, and I always followed his instructions; the prisoner was with her all day on Tuesday before my aunt\u2019s death; in the morning of that day he asked my sister Sophia to stop at Dr. Iremonger\u2019s, and ask him not to come; she refused; he said he would go himself; left the house, and was gone ten or fifteen minutes; I was not in my aunt\u2019s room all the day, except to look at her, until half-past six in the afternoon; Mrs. Hannah and the prisoner were in the room all that day; the prisoner said that I only excited her by going into her room\u2014that it was better to let her sleep; the door leading into my aunt\u2019s room was nearly closed all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>day; about half-past six the prisoner left my aunt\u2019s room and passed through the sitting room; then I went into my aunt\u2019s room, and the prisoner came in; he said I had better come out again and not excite her; after that time she told me she thought she was going to die, and when she was gone she wished myself and Sophia to see to this; just then the prisoner came into the room; I did not administer any medicine to Mrs. Stephens; Mrs. Foley and another lady came to the prisoner\u2019s house the day my aunt, the child and I were sick from eating rice; the Sunday before my aunt\u2019s death a blister was applied to the pit of her stomach; she was vomiting most all that day; the vomiting did not relieve her; from the time she first fell sick, the prisoner said if her bowels changed, she would not live twenty-four hours after that; five or six months before my aunt\u2019s \u25a0 death, I noticed his paying particular attention to my sister. (Here the witness detailed what those attentions were.) The prisoner also told about Mr. Cardwell what I knew to be untrue; he also object\u00e9d to her marrying Mr. Cardwell; -he said that Cardwell was a low, shuffling, mean fellow\u2014that he had sent his own daughter away from his house, and had poisoned his wife; this was after Mrs.' Stephens\u2019 death, about a month; the prisoner continued to pay these attentions to my sister until we left the house; one night our cousin William Knox came- into the room where I and my sister were sleeping, and lay across the foot of the bed, on the outside of the bed clothes; he kept his clothes on; William said the prisoner directed him to do so, and when I charged the prisoner withhaving sent William Knox, and told him that William had said so, he laughed and did not deny it; always when we wanted to leave the house, he brought this up to us; the prisoner administered to his wife, during her sickness, brandy, lager beer, porter, ale, milk and water, tea and coffee and lemonade; the first thing she complained of was an affection in her chest, a burning heat and red specks before her eyes,with dizziness; then she complained of a heat in her chest, and thought that her lungs were ailing; the heat was first in the pit of the stomach; she complained of this before Dr. Cad-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>mus was called\u2014in three or four days, I think; it was not severe then; afterwards she said there was a burning pain in her chest, like a ball of fire; the heat in her chest grew worse every day; she spoke of the burning pain after Dr. Cadmus called\u2014perhaps two days; it increased every day during her sickness; I first noticed my aunt\u2019s vomiting shortly after Dr. Cadmus called; she did not vomit very frequently at first; the matter vomited was of a yellowish color; it presented this color for some days, when it changed, and became of a dark green color; then it seemed darker each time until she died; I saw the prisoner take the basin to the window two or three times, and there were red spots in it, and he said he thought it was part of her liver; something would always stay in her mouth; she would have to rinse it out; if you put a piece of wood or straw through the vomited matter, it would draw it up; she said she felt as if the ball of fire would come up from her chest to her throat; she was always thirsty, constantly wanting cold drinks; her countenance changed very much; she seemed very languid and anxious, and her eyes were considerably sunk; for two or three days preceding her death, she did not answer questions readily; her limbs grew weaker during her whole sickness; in the last week her hands were numb; she kept feeling everything, and trying to see if she had any proper feeling in her hands; her legs and feet became swollen ; they began to swell two or three days before she died; they became cold; I felt them; she complained that she could not use her feet and limbs, and asked me to put something, to them to warm them; she threw her arms around the bed almost constantly, catching hold of something; her lips were swollen; her face turned red; when diarrhea set in, just before her death, the discharges were of a dark color, and were very offensive; the diarrhea continued until about two hours before she died; it commenced about Monday night, at eleven o\u2019clock, before she died; about a week before her death, there was suppression of urine, accompanied with pain, which continued until her death; her diarrhea was also accompanied with severe pain.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"75\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b428-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number><em>John </em>Qantrell, called and sworn for the People, among other things testified as follows: I am an undertaker, and had charge of the funeral of the mother of John Stephenson; it was about the twenty-eighth of August, 1857; I also had charge of the funeral of Mrs. Sophia Stephens; it took place on the twenty-fourth of September, 1857; the prisoner, I think, gave me instructions about the plate on the coffin.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"76\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b428-5\"><em>William </em>Scrimegeour, called and sworn for the People, among other things testified as follows: I am superintendent of interments at Greenwood Cemetery; by reference to my register, I recollect the burial of Mrs. Stephens on the twenty-fourth of September, 1857; the entry in the register is as follows: September 24th, 1857, the remains of Sophia Stephens were this day interred in lot number 9146; grave number 272 ; place of birth, Ireland; age, 46 years; married; late residence, 166 Bast Twenty-seventh street, New York; place of death, New York; time of death, September 23, 1857; disease, inflammation of the stomach; undertaker, John B.

found the body in a remarkable state of preservation ; the face and scalp were in an advanced state of decomposition; the viscera were apparently healthy, and in an excellent state of preservation; the viscera were removed and handed to Dr. Doremus; I took the body from a coffin, upon the plate of which I found the following: \u201c Sophia Stephens, died September 23d, 1857, aged 46.\u201d The skin was of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>dirty yellow color; the internal lining of the intestines was in a remarkable state of preservation; the internal surfaces of the lower part of the large intestines, rectum, and portion of the descending colon were reddened; this was an indication of congestion or inflammation of some period prior to death; on examining the muscular tissues of the body, I found they had not lost their coloring matter; the mucous membrane of the stomach was shrunken and much harder than usual;

if arsenic was taken in large.quantities, there might be vomiting, and death occur after many hours, and inflammation might be discovered in the stomach; there might be inflammation of the colon and rectum; ulceration and perforation of the stomach are very rare, as a consequence of arsenic ; the kidneys are the chief eliminating organs of arsenic; and, from the irritating effects of the arsenic causing a flow of blood to them, might be congested, and suppression of urine follow; the brain rarely suffers, and generally the mind is clear and serene; arsenic has an effect upon the nervous system, as shown by great prostration, feeble action of the heart, and hence a feeble pulse, with a contracted hypocratic countenance ; death may occur from arsenic, and there be no morbid appearance of the body; some of the nervous effects are want of sensation, numbness and paralysis; sometimes there is an inflammation of the mouth and lips;

the intestines were nearly empty, containing a thin film of a yellowish pasty substance, about one-half of a teaspoonful in quantity; I examined this chemically, and ascertained the presence of arsenic; seven pounds and three ounces of the viscera were examined, and yielded arsenic; I examined the muscular tissues, and discovered in it arsenic, also in the skin and bones; I estimate I discovered two grains of arsenic; there is a certain amount of loss in the processes, and I think there was from four to six grains of arsenic in the body; all the vessels and instruments used in this analysis were new ; all the acids were thoroughly tested before being used, and all the chemicals of every kind were likewise; I analyzed the shroud, part of the coffin, part of the lining of the coffin, some of the nails and screws of the coffin, and three samples of the soil of the grave from which the body was taken, but detected no arsenic; arsenic, when taken into the system, is removed chiefly by the kidneys; it begins to be removed within twenty-four horns; arsenic is not a natural constituent of the human body; a fatal dose of white arsenic may be as small as one grain, 1\u00bf, 1-&amp;, 1TV, two grains, three grains, and four grams, as reported.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"93\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b433-5\"><em>William </em>Detmold, called and examined for plaintiffs, among other things, testified as follows: I reside at No. 103 Ninth street;

Fordyce </em>Barker, called and sworn for the People, among other things, testified as follows: I reside at No. 70 Union place; am a physician; acute arsenical poisoning is where the effects are comparatively speedily produced; the symptoms are faintness, depression, nausea, vomiting, pain at the pit of the stomach, extending up to the throat, of a very burning character, and partially extending over the abdomen; another class of symptoms is due to the effects on the nervous system, viz., exhaustion, collapse, sometimes coma and death; frequently before death there is a loss of sensation, sometimes palsy, sometimes convulsions; tin chronic poisoning the symptoms are local irritation, nausea, vomiting, gradirally and more slowly developed; the pain in the stomach and throat still retains its burning character; partial paralysis is a frequent symptom; the matter vomited is frequently streaked with blood; the evacuations of the bowels resemble those of dysentery, painful and very frequent, burning heat and irritation at the extremity of the bowels; the stomach and abdomen are sensitive to pressure; a characteristic symptom is intense, urgent and constant thirst; the character of fasces varies; sometimes they are with blood,. and sometimes they are with mucus; sometimes thin, feculent and watery, of a dark color; the countenance becomes sunken, with an anxious expression; the pulse becomes feeble and rapid; the surface becomes cold and clammy, the patient restless and anxious, with loss of sensation, coma and death; the passage of urine and of the evacuations of the bowels are accompanied with pain; arsenical poison stimulates inflammation of the stomach or of the bowels, cholera or cholera morbus; the pain, in inflammation of the stomach, is accompanied with active fever; in poisoning, the pain is complained of in the track from the stomach to the throat, as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>burning, while in inflammation of the stomach it is at the seat of pain; in inflammation of the stomach it is not followed by loss of sensibility, paralysis, or incessant vomiting; in cholera morbus the difference is, that the vomiting is not accompanied with a burning sensation in the stomach and throat, and is not followed by loss of sensation or paralysis; bilious colid can hardly be mistaken for arsenical poisoning; there is a constipation of the bowels, and it is not attended with vomiting; arsenic has a tendency to retard putrefaction; there have been cases of death from arsenic, when no arsenic has been found in the stomach or any of the tissues of the body; arsenic does not exist as a natural constituent of the human body; the existence after death in the body of a certain quantity of arsenic, is proof that a greater portion has been taken into the system; laudanum would not neutralize the effects of arsenic, but would mask the symptoms.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"103\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b437-5\">Ho <em>cross-examination.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"104\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b437-6\"><em>Benjamin W. McOready, </em>called and sworn for the People, among other things, testified as follows: I reside at Ho. 8 Hinth street; am a physician; the symptoms of arsenical poisoning vary; commonly the effect begins within half an hour; the patient is seized with sickness, pain and vomiting; the burning is seated at the pit of the stomach; it may extend along the track of the gullet; the vomiting is incessant; there is intense thirst; after a time the bowels are acted upon; there is diarrhea as a rule, accompanied with a great deal of pressing and bearing down; there is often a frequent call to pass urine, it being diminished in quantity and sometimes suppressed ; there is a great general depression; the patient becomes pale; countenance anxious; the pulse frequently feeble, and finally lost, and the eyes often reddened; the patient may die with these symptoms, or, in a very rare class of cases, may die simply from the nervous effects of the arsenic, by faintness\u2014 sometimes convulsions, sometimes coma, passing into a deep sleep which ends in death; these two classes of symptoms are often mixed, the irritant and nervous effect being mingled; sometimes you have palsy, loss of feeling in some of the limbs, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>convulsions, in few cases delirium; the mind is commonly clear; the vomit is covered with yellow or green bile; the bile may be still darker, and it may be streaked with mucus and blood in specks; the pain in the stomach is increased by pressure; the prostration is very great; the discharges from the bowels may be streaked with blood; if, after a poisonous dose of arsenic has begun to take effect, laudanum were administered, it is exceedingly probable that it would take a very much larger dose of laudanum to produce the usual effect upon ' the system than it does ordinarily; whenever there is a very acute pain, violent vomiting and purging, and in certain diseases of the nervous system, large, doses of opium may be borne; arsenic is not a natural constituent of the human body;

the pain being at the pit of the stomach, extends itself all over the belly; diarrhea then ensues, the purging is constant and violent, with a great strain and effort, in my experience; the discharges have been very offensive, and sometimes streaked with blood;. generally there are streaks of blood in the vomited matter; death is usually preceded by collapse, and utter cessation of the vital powers, coldness, small pulse; usually there are cramps, spasms and paralysis in some portions of the extremities, and numbness; the disease most nearly resembling arsenical poisoning is Asiatic' cholera; in cholera, however, the vomited matter does not contain blood; there is usually no great straining; the discharges are not offensive, and not streaked with blood; there is not great tenderness to the touch upon the abdomen in cholera, as there is in arsenical poisoning; under ordinary cir<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>cumstances, the average quantity of arsenic necessary to cause death would be three grains, but there are cases upon record where much smaller quantities have caused death.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"106\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b439-5\"><em>Fdward Downes </em>Connery, called and sworn for the People, among other things, testified as follows: I am a physician;

I shall confine myself, therefore, to a very brief outline.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"275\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b468-9\">The prisoner is charged with the crime of murder, committed, it is alleged, about a year and a half ago, in September, 1857, on the person of his own wife\u2014not by violence, or in an outburst of angry passion, but by the slow, stealthy and deliberate administration, under color of food or medicine, of repeated doses (I take no notice of the laudanum), of one of the most virulent poisons known in nature. I need not say to you, gentlemen, that such a charge, involving turpitude and cruelty almost surpassing belief, should be supported either by the clearest direct and positive proof, or by a mass of circumstantial evidence, all tending to one result, and so consistent in its leading features as to leave no reasonable room for doubt. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>Whether the evidence in the present case, taken as a whole, comes up to the required standard, it will be for you to determine. The court may aid, but cannot supersede your functions. The issues of life and death are, by law, in your hands, and yours exclusively. In analyzing evidence, gentlemen, especially where it is merely or mainly circumstantial, I have always found a great advantage in keeping steadily in view the two particulars of time and place. Chronology and geography, it has been well said, are the eyes of history. To begin, then, with the first date and place of any importance in this transaction: In the year 1848 or 1849, or about that period\u2014the precise year is not material\u2014there was a respectable family of the name of Bell, living in one of the interior northern counties of Ireland, settled mostly\u2014I mention the circumstance as accounting for one of the features of the case\u2014by persons of Scotch and English extraction. It consisted of the father, a maiden sister of about 36 years of age, two daughters, one about 16, the other about 11, a younger son, and it may be some other children. Into this family the defendant, then a young man of only two or three and twenty, and possessing, as we have a right to infer from the evidence, an unexceptionable character, was introduced as a suitor. Why he selected the aunt of 36 in preference to the niece of 16 is unexplained. All we know is that he did so\u2014that his choice was ratified by its object, and that the wedding, or at least its essential preliminaries, took place under the brother\u2019s roof, and seemingly, and I think I may say actually, with the brother\u2019s approbation. Instead of the usual bridal tour\u2014usual at least among Americans\u2014the happy couple\u2014for nothing is shown to indicate that they were not then happy\u2014emigrated from the county of Cavan, a not very unusual occurrence, to the city of New York. Here we find them comfortably, and we may infer happily, established, occupying, although not very spacious, the entire of the third floor of the brick house known as 166 East Twenty-seventh street, divided into a sitting room, hall, two bedrooms and a kitchen\u2014the dimensions of the whole being about 23 feet square. And here, in an evil <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>hour\u2014evil for both parties, as its consequences, in any view of them, most painfully demonstrate\u2014they invited the eldest of their absent nieces to pay them a visit. She had then become an attractive young woman of eighteen. With her father\u2019s concurrence, and accompanied by two friends, she undertook the voyage, arriving in New York the day after her aunt had given birth to an infant daughter, and of course, in the midst of the joy which such an event was calculated to impart to both the parents, her reception, we may presume from the known attributes of the Irish character, was cordial and affectionate. One of the only two bedrooms at their command was assigned for her use; and, with commendable delicacy, that room was selected which alone opened upon the hall, and had no direct communication with the other, omwith the parlor. Here she remained for a considerable time, learning\u2014she went daily to the establishment for that purpose\u2014the trade of a dressmaker. Having at length attained sufficient skill in the use of the needle, she procured a situation as dressmaker in a private family living on the Fifth avenue, not very far distant from her aunt\u2019s residence. On one occasion, while residing at that place\u2014she' continued, it will be remembered, to reside there about three years\u2014Stephens, while the family were out of town for the summer, paid her a visit, bringing a bottle of wine with him. To gratify his curiosity, she took her uncle through the establishment, showing, him the splendid furniture, and pointing out to him, among the other chambers, her own comfortable apartment. While so engaged, her uncle, she says, seized her and attempted an act of violence to her person, the consummation of which her threatened screams alone prevented. Is this statement true ? Ho eye saw the act except her own and the prisoner\u2019s. Her subsequent silence on the subject of the alleged outrage has afforded matter of severe criticism. It is for you to judge of her explanation. She says the prisoner expressed great regret for the hasty indignity, and threatened, if she disclosed it, to separate from'her aunt' and break up the family. His penitence and his threats combined\u2014although not quite reconcilable with each other\u2014 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>sealed her lips. But why, only six months after, did she return, even with the safeguard of her aunt\u2019s presence, to sleep under the roof of the man, although her uncle, who had so lately demonstrated his unfitness to be trusted? The first exceptionable occurrence, it will be remembered, if the testimony is to be relied on, took place about the month of September, 1856.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"276\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b471-5\">Shortly afterwards the youngest sister, then still in Ireland, being in bad health, was recommended, it seems, to take a sea voyage. A correspondence accordingly ensued, and the invalid was invited by her uncle and aunt, to make them a visit, to return, after a year\u2019s absence, to her native home. She (that is, Fanny Bell, the younger sister), arrived here, a girl of eighteen, in March or April, 1857, about six months after the occurrence alluded to, and about six months before her aunt\u2019s death. She (I mean Fanny Bell) went immediately to her aunt\u2019s house. It was natural that her sister there should join her, or be there to receive her. They could be company for each other, and (a consideration which, with their probably very limited means, was not to be disregarded), they could, as two sisters well might, occupy the same room and the same bed. Their father, too, little imagining such a scene as this trial presents, and having an entire confidence, it would seem, in the defendant\u2019s prudence and integrity, had instructed them to be guided in all things by their uncle\u2019s advice. Under the same roof also was their infant cousin, their aunt\u2019s bright and petted only child. The prisoner himself has demonstrated in the face of ' the court and jury the existence and probable force of that attraction. .Whether these circumstances are sufficient or not to account satisfactorily for Sophia Bell\u2019s return to her uncle\u2019s house, notwithstanding the alleged outrage, it will be for you to determine. Assuming, for the present, that this first offence was attempted, was regretted and was forgiven\u2014all of which you are to judge of\u2014we may pass on to the next incident of importance which the testimony discloses. You will bear in mind that both sisters, although they went out to work as dressmakers, were now, in the spring of 1857, living with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>their aunt, contributing, as we may presume, one or both of them, to the expenses of the house during the six months (an important era) immediately preceding her death. Toward the close of that period, in the month of August, an altercation, it is alleged (it is the next incident in order), took place in the parlor between Stephens and his wife, about the funeral of a friend. Stephens dressed himself to attend it. His wife wished to accompany him. He refused to wait for her. 'Words passed, and he, it is said, struck her a blow in the eye, upon which she exclaimed that he was a murderer, or that he was murdering her. The door of the room, at the time, was not quite closed, and both the sisters were standing outside. On hearing the noise and the blow they entered, and saw their aunt with a handkerchief held to her eye. She wished them not to speak of what had taken place.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"277\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b472-5\">Such is their version of the second material incident bearing on the question of motive. The prisoner\u2019s counsel contend that the whole is a mere fiction, and, undoubtedly, there is some strong testimony which it is difficult to reconcile with the absolute truth of the statement. The existence of the black eye was subsequently perceived, it is true, by other witnesses, but others again did not observe it. The probabilities of the case may be, that a blow was given, but that its results were not so visible as to be noticed by a casual observer. In this way, only, if at all, can the testimony be reconciled. It may be proper here to add, as an established rule of evidence, that where testimony, seemingly conflicting, can be reconciled, perjury is not to be presumed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"278\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b472-6\">In addition to the outrage referred to, one of the sisters swears that about the same period, although I do not understand her to speak of the same occasion, she heard the prisoner say he wished her aunt dead, or out of the way. Indeed, according to the accounts of both the sisters, contradicted strongly by other witnesses, he made no secret at this time of his unkind feelings toward her, treating her with much roughness and disrespect, both in word and manner, while he evinced, as some of his later expressions would seem to prove, a marked <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>partiality toward one of the nieces. He dwelt particularly, they say, upon the unfortunate disparity in the ages of himself and wife, she being about forty-six, while he was only thirty-two. When he accompanied her, which, however, he often refused to do, it was a source of annoyance to him that the world should say she looked old enough to be his mother. On the other hand, however, the prisoner has shown by numerous witnesses, that the kindest relations subsisted between himself and his wife, and that in her dying moments she addressed him in terms of tenderness and endearment. But assuming, on this point, all the evidence on the part of the prosecution in its main outlines to be true, it is far from sufficient, by itself, to make out a case of contemplated murder. Spleen, and disappointment, and jealousy, and ill-humor, may exist without the remotest approach to a murderous intent. Even a blow in the face, if with the hand merely, scandalous and unmanly as it may be on the part of the perpetrator, where a woman is the object, and especially if that woman be a wife, is no evi dence, or, if any, very slight, of a design to kill.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"279\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b473-5\">There occurred, however, simultaneously, or about simultaneously with this transaction, the most important incident which the testimony has disclosed. Mr. Elynn, a druggist residing in the Second avenue, within a very short distance of the prisoner\u2019s home, whose place the prisoner had for several years been in the habit of visiting, swears that about six weeks before Mrs. Stephens died, he sold her husband a parcel, consisting of half an ounce of white arsenic, and again, in the course of the ensuing week, another like quantity of the same material. A fact like this, if unexplained, would add terrible significancy to the previous outrage, if that outrage, as the prosecution contend, was actually perpetrated by the prisoner. You will, therefore, give to the evidence\u2014somewhat contradictory as it seems to be\u2014in relation to the alleged blow inflicted upon the deceased, the most careful consideration. Whether you find the blow to have been inflicted or not, or whether you find it to have been a comparatively slight or a more severe one, the inquiry will still have to be answered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>(the contradicting testimony of James Hannah I shall presently consider), what induced the purchase and repeated purchase by the prisoner, at the time referred to, of so large a quantity, or any quantity of a known deadly poison, and to what purpose was it to be, and was it in fact applied? We find the wife of the prisoner, on or about the 6th of September, within a few weeks or days after the purchase, complaining, though very slightly, of a pain in her chest. Her husband, contrary to her wishes, sent for a physician. The physician, after two attendances, deeming the matter of little consequence, discontinued his visits, and at the end of a year and a half, so slight had been the impression made, upon his mind, was unable to recollect the symptoms of his patient. In ten or eleven days, however, the case assumed a serious form, and another doctor was sent for. This was five days only, I think, before the patient\u2019s death. He found the patient suffering from pain in the pit of the stomach, and vomiting, and great debility. His visits, nevertheless, after three short attendances, of only a few minutes each, by direction of the prisoner,.it is said, were discontinued, and in thirty-six to forty hours thereafter, his late patient was a corpse. Her death took place at about 2 o\u2019clock, on the morning of the 23d September, 1857, being the 18th day from the commencement of her illness, if we count from the first visit of Dr. Cadmus, on the 6th of that month.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"280\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b474-5\">You have heard detailed by three or more witnesses, the burning thirst and other symptoms which exhibited themselves during that period, and especially on the Sunday, Monday and Tuesday, preceding its termination. You have also heard from the lips of some of the most distinguished members of the medical profession\u2014all agreeing in the-main features of their testimony\u2014what are the effects exhibited before death where arsenic has been taken in poisonous quantities, and which of those effects are peculiar to that one cause. On these statements, weighing them deliberately, it will be for you to determine, as one of the steps to your ultimate conclusion, whether the symptoms in the case before you were, in point <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>of fact, the same substantially as those attendant on arsenious poisoning. Should the comparison, after the most careful study of every particular, still leave any doubt on the mind, you will then have the right, and it will then be your duty, to look to another, and perhaps the most wonderful feature in this most remarkable case. <em>Post-mortem </em>examinations, as generally understood, are dissections of the body made within a few hours, or, at furthest, days after the death. In the instance of Mrs. Stephens, a whole year had elapsed. She died on the 23d of September, 1857, and was exhumed on the 23d of September, 1858.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"281\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b475-5\">This long period of interment, so fatal in ordinary cases to both observation and experiment, has furnished, it is said, one of the strongest links in the chain of evidence to establish the fact that arsenious poison, howsoever and by whomsoever admininstered, was the true cause of the death in question. The body was in a state of preservation, to be accounted for, say the chemists, by the known action of arsenic, and yielded, under the operation of, probably, the most perfect and careful analysis ever conducted by scientific men, a sufficient quantity of the poison to demonstrate that arsenic had been taken into the system before death, and that death resulted from it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"282\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b475-6\">I need not go over those admirable experiments which so wonderfully illustrate the powers of science, and do much honor to Dr. Doremus and his associates. They have been almost repeated by description in the course of the trial, and must be fresh in your recollection. It will be for you to consider them candidly, and to give them, as on a question of life \u2022 and death, all the weight to which, in your deliberate judgment, making due allowance for possible error, they shall seem entitled. Should you come to the conclusion that these evidences, thus elicited from the dead body, taken in connection with the symptoms displayed in the living, established, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the deceased died of the effects of arsenic, your next inquiry will be- (and it is not absolutely free from difficulty), by whom, and with what intent, was the poison administered. I shall not stop to consider a suggestion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>slightly indicated in some of the statements of the defendants\u2019 witnesses, that the blood nieces of the wife were the authors of her death. \u00a1No conceivable motive existed or has been assigned for such an act on their part; and the implied charge may be placed, I think, rather to the account of a spirit of partizanship (of which there have been indications on both sides) than to a spirit of candor. \u00a1Dismissing that suggestion \u2014a suggestion rather calculated to injure than to advance the cause of the prisoner\u2014I shall now call your attention for a few moments to the position on this point taken by the counsel for the People. The prisoner\u2019s wife, you will recollect, was confessedly fourteen years older than himself. Although fair and robust, she had lost one of the great elements of female beauty\u2014her teeth, as is but too common an occurrence in this climate, had been the victims of premature decay; and her disposition, whatever it may have been originally\u2014if the character given by the prisoner\u2019s sister is to be relied on\u2014had, for at least two years past, assumed a complaining type. Her niece, on the other hand, who was in constant habits of intimacy with the prisoner\u2019s family, was young, and had just attained the age of womanhood. That niece has been before on the witness stand. You have had ocular evidence of her personal appearance, whether attractive or otherwise, and of the probable influence, if any, upon the mind of the prisoner. In an unguarded moment\u2014giving to the transaction its mildest construction\u2014he showed its actual influence, if her testimony is correct, in an unlawful attempt during his wife\u2019s lifetime, the particulars of which have been given, and need not again be repeated. And in a month after his wife\u2019s death\u2014 the barrier to a new union being removed\u2014according to the same testimony, he made formal and urgent proposals of marriage, which, being rejected, were followed by a second unsuccessful attempt upon her person, and at last, by a scandalous anonymous letter, addressed to a rival suitor, to prevent the consummation of a pending engagement, destructive of his hopes. This letter you will probably regard as of great importance in determining the state of the writer\u2019s mind at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>time it was conceived, and as reflecting back with much significancy upon an anterior period of his life, if written by the prisoner. Its authorship, therefore, becomes a matter to be carefully inquired into. On this point, you will recollect, one of the Misses Bell swears that she is acquainted with the prisoner\u2019s hand, and that the writing is his. In a civil .suit this evidence, unless contradicted, would be sufficient to establish the fact, In a case of life and death, however, unless fortified by other circumstances, the mere evidence of such handwriting might well be distrusted. But we have the additional fact, testified to by Mr. Flynn, that the prisoner came to him with a letter inclosed in an envelope, requesting him to write the address; that he did so, and that the envelope produced by the witness, Cardwell, is the identical paper. Cardwell then testifies that the letter so addressed was handed to him by a boy, and that it is the same as now in court. Neither of these witnesses being impeached, their testimony, if believed, would seem, even without the aid of Miss BeE\u2019s, to fix the authorship upon the prisoner. What, then, does the writing of such a coarse, Eliterate, anonymous production indicate ? There can be, it would seem, but one answer\u2014disappointed passion and thirst for revenge; and a striking confirmation, more or less complete, of the narrative of his conduct given by the Misses Bell. I have assumed thus far that the evidence given by Flynn, of the purchase by the prisoner of arsenic, on two occasions, shortly before his wife\u2019s Elness, remains uncontradicted and unexplained. This assumption must now be modified, if not reversed. Mr. and Mrs. Hannah, the brother-in-law and sister of the prisoner, and I think their two daughters also, testify in effect that the poison was purchased for, and actually appEed to, the ordinary purpose of destroying vermin; and that it was so used\u2014not on the premises of the prisoner, but on those of his sister\u2019s family. This testimony, as you will remember, has been criticised with much severity. It, no doubt, requires to be closely scrutinized, but is not necessarEy to be discredited. It presents the spectacle of a married sister, with all the members of her immediate family in her behalf, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>struggling\u2014and, if supported by a, conscious sense of truth, justly struggling\u2014to save a brother from an ignominious death. Such a case calls for much indulgence on the one hand, and for considerable drawbacks on the other. We have the highest authority for saying, \u201cWhat will not. a man give in exchange for his life?\u201d And it will be for you, gentlemen, to say whether, in the present instance, life has or has not been sought to be purchased at the expense of truth. If you come to the conclusion that the poison testified by Mr. Flynn to have been sold to the prisoner on the two occasions referred to, shortly before the illness of the deceased, was in fact sold to Hannah (the .prisoner being only present at the purchase), and that it was in fact applied by Hannah to the destruction of vermin, and not to the destruction of the prisoner\u2019s wife, then one of the main, though perhaps not essential proofs of the charge against him, will have been overthrown. '</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"283\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b478-6\">Still, however, the oft-repeated inquiry will remain, how came arsenic to be found (if it really was found), in the body of the deceased a year after its interment ? ' H arsenic, as the men of science say, be not a constituent of the human frame, either before or after death, by what agency was it in this instance infused into every part of the system ? The two physicians, Drs. Cadmus and Iremonger, who successively for a few days attended the deceased, swear, in effect, that there was no arsenic in their prescriptions. These, therefore, by whomsoever administered, unless we suppose some unexplained accident, could not have been the cause. As to the food and drinks\u2014the latter so incessantly called for\u2014they appear to have been given to the deceased by the prisoner and his sister and his nieces, indiscriminately. There was ample opportunity, if so disposed, to infuse arsenic into them by either, or by two or more of them combined. It is for you to weigh the respective probabilities. Why, it has been asked, did the prisoner, if desirous of preserving his wife\u2019s life, not send for a physician ? Or, rather, why did he at the most critical moment direct\u2014if such was the fact\u2014a discontinuance of the medical visits ? I confess to you, gentlemen, that with no little desire <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>to be charitable, I have found some difficulty in answering this question. It may have been that \u201c his poverty, not his will, consented.\u201d But why not make at least an effort? 'When, with the terrible sufferings of his wife before him, the mother of his only child, sufferings sufficient to excite the sympathy of the coldest, and to prompt the most indolent to exertion, why did he not go\u2014I had almost said rush\u2014to the physician, and beg, if he could not buy him, to come to her relief? The act might have been ineffectual, but it would at least have been demonstrative of kindness and hope. Instead of that, the prisoner, through one of his witnesses, tells us that, yielding to his wife\u2019s entreaty, he retired to an adjoining room, went to bed, and did not return till the lapse of five or six hours, at the moment the sufferer was drawing her last breath before dissolution.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"284\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b479-5\">The prisoner at the time, gentlemen, it will be recollected, was not a giddy, thoughtless youth. He was a man thirty-two years of age\u2014a father, a member of the church, a teacher in one of its Sunday schools. What, then, it maybe asked, does such conduct, under such circumstances, indicate. Does it indicate merely apathy and indifference, or does it indicate, with other circumstances, a transfer of the husband\u2019s affections from his wife to another object? In this connection it must be observed that the defendant himself has proved, by his own witnesses, a very striking intimacy, both before and after the death, between himself and his wife\u2019s niece; an intimacy which, in an anonymous letter, he was willing to insinuate had reached, or nearly reached, the point of actual criminality. As it is your province, however, gentlemen (it being a criminal case), to determine the meaning of that letter, in the light of the surrounding circumstances, and to ascertain, with that aid, the inferences legitimately to be drawn from it, and as its bearing upon the question in issue is deemed to be of controlling importance, reflecting its shadows back upon the dark night of the 22d of September, I shall detain you a few moments by laying before you once more its literal contents. It was ad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>dressed, you will recollect\u2014I mean the envelope\u2014to Mr. Samuel Cardwell, the supposed suitor of the lady.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"285\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b480-5\">(The judge then read the letter in the hearing of the jury.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"286\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b480-6\">If then, gentlemen, you find that the deceased died of the effects of arsenic, that the poison was not given to or taken by her through mistake or accident, that it was administered designedly by some person attending on her, that there is no reasonable ground for attributing the deed to any person other than the prisoner, you will still have to consider whether the case against him, calmly viewed in all its bearings, is so clear as to admit of an unhesitating verdict of conviction. Hesitation in capital cases, as you well know, is the property of the accused. A lurking, anxious impression of possible innocence, should such impression exist, is enough to stay the hand of criminal justice. It is better, says the law, that ten guilty should escape than one innocent suffer. By this, however, you will not understand me as expressing or implying an opinion on the offence with which he is charged, for or against the prisoner at the bar. That is your prerogative, as it is your painful duty, and to you I leave it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"287\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b480-7\">Thereupon the counsel for the defendant excepted to each and every part and portion of the said charge, as being contrary to both the law and the fact.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"288\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b480-8\">Which exception the court refused to allow.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"289\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b480-9\">The counsel for the defendant requested the court to present the following propositions to the jury as part of its charge:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"290\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b480-10\">1. That the counsel for the prosecution having read to the medical witnesses certain symptoms from a paper marked by the judge, and inquired their opinion as to the cause of death in a case where such symptoms existed, if the jury believe that the symptoms of which Mrs. Stephens complained in her life time, are not in all respects the symptoms stated in the paper read to the physicians, that then the medical opinions are not admissible as competent evidence to be weighed by the jury, and cannot be taken into consideration.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"291\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b481-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>2. That if the jury are of opinion that the body of Mrs. Stephens, after being exhumed for analysis, was so exposed that access could be had to it by other parties than those who made the <em>post-mortem </em>examination of the body and conducted the chemical analysis, and particularly if they believe that Robert Bell, one of the witnesses for the prosecution, who first charged the prisoner with poisoning his wife, actually had access to the body and touched it, an analysis made under such circumstances is not competent evidence against the prisoner, and should be disregarded by the jury.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"292\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b481-5\">3. That when a prisoner is charged with the commission of a crime, and evidence of good character is introduced by him, which is not controverted on the part of the People, such evidence is to be considered by the jury, and is not merely of value in doubtful cases, but will of itself sometimes create a doubt, where, without it, none could exist; and if good character be proved to the satisfaction of the jury, it should produce an acquittal, even in cases where the whole evidence slightly preponderates against the accused.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"293\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b481-6\">4.

That if the jury believe that Robert Bell attempted to assassinate the prisoner before his arrest upon the charge of poisoning his wife, and.that he entertained feelings of animosity and hatred towards him, and that if the jury believe that Sophia and Fanny Bell are also hostile towards the prisoner, and have quarrelled with him, that then they should consider these matters in weighing the degree of credit which is to be given to their testimony.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"296\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b481-9\">The court then charged affirmatively on each of the said propositions, as requested by the defence, except the second, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>on which, modified so as to read as follows, the court also charged affirmatively:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"297\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b482-5\">That if the jury are of opinion that the body of Mrs. Stephens, after being exhumed for analysis, was so exposed that access could be had to it by other parties than those who made the <em>post-mortem, </em>examination of the body, and conducted the chemical analysis, under such circumstances that they could have applied arsenic to it, and particularly if they believe that Eobert Bell, one of the witnesses for the prosecution, who first charged the prisoner with poisoning his wife, actually had access to the body and tampered with it, so much of the analysis as was made after the body was so exposed and tampered with, is not competent evidence against the prisoner, and should be disregarded by the jury: to which refusal of the court to charge in favor of the second proposition as submitted, and to the charge of the court in favor of the second proposition as modified, the counsel for the prisoner excepted.

The question arises in this case, what is the record, and what will the court regard as such ? It will be contended, on the part of the plaintiff in error, that the record is an authentic testimony in writing of the proceedings in an action at law, which is preserved in a court of record. In other words, it may be defined to be a written memorial made by a public officer, authorized by law to perform that function, and intended to serve as evidence of something <em>written, said </em>or <em>done. </em>Hence, every transaction which appears authoritatively to have taken place during the trial of the case, makes up the record. <em>Brit-ton (ch. </em>27), says : \u201c That a record is an authentic testimony in writing, contained in rolls of parchment. In these are contained the judgment of the court in each case, and <em>all the proceedings </em>previous, carefully preserved.\u201d So <em>Blackstone </em>says (1 <em>Com., </em>69), the judgment itself, and <em>all </em>the proceedings <em>previous thereto, </em>are carefully registered and preserved under the name of <em>records, </em>in public repositories set apart for that particular purpose; and to them frequent recourse is had when any critical question arises. (18 <em>Viner's Ab., </em>176; <em>Jewell </em>v. <em>The Com., </em>10 <em>Harris R., </em>94; <em>Fisher </em>v. <em>Cockerell, </em>5 <em>Pet. R., 253</em>; <em>Read </em>v. <em>Marsh, </em>13 <em>Pet. R., </em>153; <em>Sutliffe </em>v. <em>The State, </em>18 <em>Ohio R., </em>469; <em>Com. </em>v. <em>Pfeifer, </em>3 <em>Harris R., </em>489; <em>People </em>v. <em>Cancemi, </em>7 <em>Abbott Pr. R., </em>299; 2 <em>R. S., </em>921.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"317\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b485-5\">II. A challenge for principal cause forms part of the record, and also all affidavits filed below. Hone of the affidavits which were read in the Court of Oyer and Terminer, nor any of the challenges made in the present case, appear on the return to the writ of error, but have been brought up on the <em>certiorari. </em>The minutes or docket entries, are also a part of the record. <em>Ex parte Vermilyea, </em>6 <em>Cow. R., </em>555; <em>Jewell </em>v. <em>The Com., </em>10 <em>Harris R., </em>94; <em>Sutliffe. </em>v. <em>The State, </em>18 <em>Ohio R., </em>469; <em>Com. </em>v. <em>Pfeifer, 3 Harris R., </em>489; <em>Beal </em>v. <em>Langstaff, 2 Wilson, </em>371.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"318\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b485-6\">HI. The term of the Court of Oyer and Terminer, at which the defendant was tried, having ended, the record must stand as it is, and is not susceptible of amendment, the statute of Jeofails notextending to criminal cases. \u201cDuring the <em>term </em>wherein any judicial act is done, the record remains in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number><em>breast of the judges of the court, </em>and in their remembrance, and therefore the roll is alterable, during that term, as the judges shall direct; but when that term is <em>past, </em>it admits of no <em>alteration, </em>averment or proof to the contrary.\u201d <em>(Co. Litt., </em>260, <em>a.; The King </em>v. <em>Selfe, </em>8 <em>Mod. R., </em>45; <em>Bold's Case, </em>1 <em>Salk. R., </em>53; <em>King </em>v. <em>Keat, </em>1 <em>Salk. R., </em>48.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"319\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b486-5\">IY. Whenever an amendment to a record in a criminal case is permitted, it is made from the minutes or docket of the clerk of the court, or the clerk of the assize, but there is no instance of the minutes or docket entries being corrected by what is subsequently made up and termed the record. <em>(Davenport </em>v. <em>Israel, Cumberback's R., </em>285; <em>Hill </em>v. <em>Prowse, Noy's R., </em>118; <em>Tidd's Prac., </em>931.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"320\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b486-6\">Y. The District Attorney has no authority, by law, to make up a record in any criminal case, except when requested by a defendant; and he can only furnish the clerk of the court in which the defendant is convicted, the <em>statement of the offence </em>required to be entered in the minutes of the clerk. <em>(R. S., part </em>4, <em>title </em>6, <em>art. </em>1; 2 <em>B. S, </em>921, \u00a7\u00a74, 6, 7, 8, 12.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"321\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b486-7\">YI. The record, in the present case, does not show that the prisoner was present in court during the whole of the trial, nor at the rendition of the verdict. The following cases establish the position that such an omission is fatal. <em>(Dunn </em>v. <em>The Com., </em>6 <em>Barr's R., </em>389; <em>State </em>v. <em>Travers, </em>1 <em>Overton R., </em>434; <em>People </em>v. <em>Perkins, </em>1 <em>Wend. R., </em>91; <em>Rex </em>v. <em>Ladsingham, T. Raymond R., </em>193; <em>Holliday </em>v. <em>The People, </em>4 <em>Gilmans R., </em>111; <em>Co. Litt, </em>227, <em>b.; Cole </em>v. <em>The State, </em>5 <em>English R., </em>318.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"322\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b486-8\">YU. The record shows, and also the affidavits, which make a part of it, that the jury were permitted to separate during the trial of the defendant, and suffered to mingle with their fellow citizens, and were not kept together in the care of sworn officers and bailiffs. Such a separation is fatal to a verdict, against the prisoner in a capital case. Such is the English law. <em>(Hays' Cr. Dig., </em>449; <em>King </em>v. <em>Stone, </em>6 <em>Durn. &amp; East., </em>53.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"323\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b486-9\">YIII. The weight of judicial authority, in the other States of the Union, is in conformity with the English rule. <em>(Com. </em>v. <em>Caul, </em>1 <em>Virg. Cas., </em>271; <em>Wiley </em>v. <em>State, </em>1 <em>Swan, </em>256; <em>Pfeifer </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>v. <em>Com., </em>3 <em>Harris, </em>468; <em>Wesley </em>v. <em>State, </em>11 <em>Humph., </em>502; <em>McCann </em>v. <em>State, </em>9 <em>Sme. &amp; Mar., </em>465; <em>Com. </em>v. <em>Wormley, </em>8 <em>Grattan, </em>712; <em>State </em>v. <em>Prescott, </em>7 <em>N. Hamp., </em>287; Berry v. State, 10 <em>Geo., </em>511, <em>Brayton, </em>169; McLean <em>v. State, </em>8 <em>Miss., </em>153; <em>Jones </em>v. State, 2 <em>Blackf., </em>475; <em>Cochran </em>v. State, 7 <em>Humph., 544; Boles v. State, </em>13 <em>Smead. &amp; Marsh., </em>398; 5 <em>Geo., </em>85; <em>Com. </em>v. <em>Roley, </em>2 Pick., 496.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"324\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b487-5\">IX. The law of New York, in respect to the separation of jurors, during the trial of a capital case, is similar to the English law; and, when it is permitted to take place, whether <em>with </em>or <em>without </em>the consent of the court, will vitiate the verdict. (P<em>eople </em>v. <em>McKay, </em>18 <em>John. </em>212: <em>Eastwood </em>v. <em>The People, </em>3 <em>Park. Cr. R., </em>25.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"325\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b487-6\">X. The record in the present case, shows that the trial of the prisoner continued three weeks, and that during all that long period of time the jury were not kept together, but permitted to mingle with the community. If the separation of one or two jurors, for a short time, from the rest of the panel, is in law sufficient ground to set aside a verdict in a capital case, how much is the necessity for doing so increased, where the whole of the jurors were suffered to disperse during the period of an exciting trial.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"326\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b487-7\">XI. In the case of the present defendant, it was <em>not </em>shown <em>affirmatively </em>on the part of the prosecution, and by <em>the dearest evidence, and beyond a reasonable doubt, </em>or by any evidence at all, that no injury to the prisoner occurred in consequence of the separation of' the jury; but it was shown by affidavit, on the part of the prisoner, that the principal witness for the prosecution talked with two of the jurors on the subject of the trial, during the intervals of the adjournments of the court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"327\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b487-8\">XII. It is not true, in point of fact, that the separation took place by the agreement of the defendant\u2019s counsel. They stated they had no objection to the jury separating. Still, the record alleges that it was with their <em>consent, </em>and that is the aspect in which it must be considered here.

It is believed to be the general practice in trials of indictments for felonies of any grade, except that punishable by death, to permit a separation of the jury, and judges of extensive experience have extended that practice to capital cases.

The universality of that rule was questioned at an early day, and after a fall deliberation in the case of the two <em>Kinlocks (Foster, </em>22), it was held by nine out of ten judges, giving their opinions seriatim, not to be universally binding.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">Sir M. Foster, in giving his opinion, states several exceptions to the rule, and showed that the only authority cited by Lord Coke in support of the position, did not in the least warrant it; and that the authority itself was subsequently overruled, and he comes to the conclusion that the power of the court in discharging juries is not capable of being determined by any general rule, but must be governed by the particular circumstances of the case presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">That principle was afterwards recognized by Mr. Justice Blackstone in his Commentaries, who, in treating of trials in criminal cases, says that \u201c when the evidence on both sides is closed, and, .indeed, when any evidence has been given, the jury cannot be discharged (unless in cases of evident necessity), till they have given in their verdict.\u201d (4 <em>Com., </em>360.)</p>\n<p id=\"b497-7\">Exceptions are thus engrafted on the general rule as laid down by Lord Coke, and cases of necessity being admitted to form exceptions, it is necessarily left to the discretion of the court to judge of that necessity.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-8\">It appears from what is stated in <em>Rex </em>v. <em>Stone </em>(6 <em>Durn. &amp; East, </em>527), tried at bar, that it was formerly deemed necessary, in order to carry out that rule, that a trial in a criminal case should be continued without interruption from its commencement to its close. In that case, the inconvenience, if not impossibility, of a strict adherence to that requirement became apparent. The prisoner was tried on an indictment for high treason, and it is stated in the report of the case that the court having sat, on the first day of the trial, from nine o\u2019clock in the morning till ten o\u2019clock at night, without any interruption or refreshment, the Attorney-General stating that his evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>would occupy four hours more, and some of the jury being very much exhausted, and incapable, as they declared, of keeping up their attention much longer, the court adjourned till nine o\u2019clock the next morning; Lord Kenyon observing that necessity justified what was compelled, and that though it was left to modern times to bring forward cases of such extraordinary length, yet no rule could compel the court to continue longer sitting than their material powers would enable them to do the business of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">The jury retired to an adjoining tavern, where accommodations were prepared for them, and the bailiffs were sworn \u201c well and truly to keep the jury, and neither to speak to them themselves, nor suffer any other person to speak to them touching any matter relative to the trial.\u201d It is stated in a note to that case, that at the Old Bailey, in the latter end of 1794, the trials of various persons for high treason lasted, Hardy\u2019s, nine days; Horne Tooke\u2019s, six days; and Thelwall\u2019s, four days. On the first of these trials, the adjournment was stated to be made by the consent of the prisoner, but on the second, the judges who sat, having in the meantime conferred with the rest of their brethren, said they were clearly of opinion it might and ought to be done <em>by the authority of the court, </em>without calling on the prisoner for any consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">The rule was subsequently further relaxed in cases of misdemeanors, so far as to permit a separation of the jury without the custody of any officers during the progress of the trial, and the practice was sustained, after full consideration, in <em>Rex </em>v. <em>Woolf </em>and others, decided in 1819. (1 <em>Chitty R., </em>401; <em>also reported in 2 Barn. &amp; Ald., </em>462.) The defendants in that case were tried on an indictment for a conspiracy, before Abbott, Ch. J., and found guilty. Their trial lasted two days. The court, at about eleven o\u2019clock p. m. of the first day (the case being then unfinished), adjourned until the following morning, and the jury were permitted to separate and retire to their respective homes without the knowledge of the defendants or their attorneys, and on that ground an application was subsesequently made to set aside the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>The judges, Abbott, Ch. J., Bayley, Holroyd and Best, justices, delivered their opinions <em>seriatim </em>against the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">Chief Justice Abbott said his opinion was founded on the admitted fact that there were many instances of late years in which jurors in trials for misdemeanors had dispersed and gone to their abodes during the night for which the adjournment took place, and he considered every instance in which that had been done, to be proof that it may be lawfully done; and Justice Best, after referring to the cases cited in support of the motion, concludes that the only, one which touched the question under consideration, was that of Lord Delamere, in the <em>4th State Trials, </em>232, where, as he remarks, the judges appeared to have said that a jury once charged cannot be discharged.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">In reference to which he says that such might have been the law at one time, but that the constant and uniform practice which had existed for a considerable length of time in discharging juries, would show that which was said in Lord Delamere\u2019s case was not to govern their decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-7\">The other cases were those where there had either been improper conduct on the part of the jurors after they were sent out to deliberate on their verdict, or where improper practices had been used by the parties to influence the decision of the jury in their favor. (See also 1 <em>Chitty's Cr. L., </em>628.)</p>\n<p id=\"b499-8\">It thus appears that in England the rule as laid down in Blackstone is so construed as to concede that the court have the power to permit a separation of the jury in cases of misdemeanor, and that its exercise is left entirely to the discretion of the court. It is true that no decisions have been produced establishing that authority there in capital cases, nor, on the other hand, have we been referred to any denying it. The important consequences dependent on the results of such trials, are calculated to secure and enforce all precautionary measures necessary to guard against improper influences, and may have restrained the judges from exercising the discretion vested in them.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>The rule itself excepts no class of offences from its operation, but all are alike comprehended within its inhibitions.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">When, therefore, it is established that <em>the power </em>to authorize a separation exists in one class of cases, it is difficult to see why it does not exist in all. The power itself may be general, while its exercise, in a sound discretion, may be limited.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">In this country there has not been a uniformity of practice on the question under consideration. While it is conceded (I believe without exception) to be discretionary with the court, whether the jurors shall be kept together or be permitted to separate on trials of misdemeanor, that right, in cases of felony, is denied in some of the States, in others it is not only admitted and fully recognized, but the rules applicable to the exercise of that power in civil cases, are extended to criminal cases, so far even as to authorize a sealed verdict to be rendered. Thus it was held in a case in Missouri, decided in 1843, and in cases in Pennsylvania and Tennessee, decided in 1851 (all capital cases), that the separation of jurors by the permission of the court (and in the last two cases by the consent of the prisoner) was a ground for setting aside a verdict. (See <em>McLean </em>v. <em>State, </em>8 <em>Miss., </em>153; <em>Pfeifer </em>v. <em>Com., </em>3 <em>Harris, </em>468; <em>and Wesley </em>v. <em>State, </em>11 <em>Humph., </em>502. )</p>\n<p id=\"b500-7\">It is stated in the case of <em>Berry </em>v. <em>State, </em>decid\u00e9d in Georgia in 1851 (10 <em>Geo., </em>511), in which the prisoner was convicted of larceny, after a separation of the jury by consent during the trial, that it was the duty of the court to keep the jury together in criminal cases, from the time the case is submitted to them until they are finally discharged from its consideration; but they nevertheless refused to grant a new trial. \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b500-8\">In Ohio, the court, after full deliberation, have decided that it was not only competent to permit a separation of the jurors during the progress of the trial, but they have permitted them, on the submission of the case, to disperse after they had agreed, and return a sealed verdict. <em>(Sargent </em>v. <em>State, </em>11 <em>Ohio, </em>474; <em>State </em>v. <em>Engle, </em>13 <em>Ib., </em>490; <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Same, </em>15 <em>Ib., </em>72.)</p>\n<p id=\"b500-9\">The first of these cases was for passing counterfeit money ; the second for manslaughter, and the last for arson.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>Several cases were cited on the argument, the principal of which are referred to by Justice Selden in <em>Eastwood </em>v. <em>The People </em>(3 <em>Park. Cr. R., </em>25), showing the consequences of a separation of a jury after the case was finally submitted to them for deliberation and decision. Some of these assert the doctrine that the' fact of separation alone vitiates the verdict, while in others it is held that abuse, or at least reasonable suspicion of abuse, to the injury of the prisoner, must be shown. The principal, and generally considered as the leading case in support of the first position, is that of <em>The Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McCaul </em>(1 <em>Virginia </em>Cases, 271).</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">In that case (which was one of felony for taking bank notes and coin from the State treasury), it appeared that the court, on the second, third and fourth days of the trial, made a temporary adjournment of a short duration, about two p. M., and that a general order was given by the court to the jury and the officers on the first evening of the trial, that the jury, on their being adjourned, should be kept together and not separated. Notwithstanding this direction, one of the jurors, against the remonstrance of the officer, went home for his dinner, and another, attended by an officer, visited his family, assigning the sickness of one of his children as his excuse. They remained from fifteen to twenty minutes. The first was asked by several persons whether the case of McCaul was determined. He said no, and no further conversation was had on the subject, and he excused his conduct on the ground of being unexpectedly sworn on the jury, leaving his business in such a state of derangement as to require his presence. The verdict was set aside, and Judge Nelson, in giving his decision, says: \u201c The majority of the court were of opinion that proof of actual tampering or conversation on the subject with a juryman, was not necessary to set aside the verdict. The old rule was, that the jury was on no occasion to separate. I understand (though it was with difficulty the rule had at all been relaxed), that it relaxed only in cases of imperious or perhaps unavoidable necessity; such a proceeding would be productive of evils incalculable, and too great for the court by its de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>cisions to allow a door to be opened for them. Every danger, and particularly in such a case as this, should be watched and opposed in the beginning. The court will presume with fear and jealousy, and will not expose the trial by jury in criminal cases, to such risk of contamination as arises from the affidavits in this case. If the court had without necessity suffered a juryman to go home without an officer (which it would never do), it would vitiate the verdict. There is as much danger in suffering a juryman to separate without \"the consent of the court, as if it had been done by such consent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">I have made these liberal extracts for the purpose of showing, first, on what slight facts and circumstances so strong an opinion was based, and next, that in view of the fact hereafter mentioned, the authority of the case (at least to the extent expressed in that opinion), is questionable. It was decided in 1812, and was reviewed in 1825, in a subsequent case in the same court <em>(Thomas </em>v. Commonwealth, 2 <em>Virginia Cases, </em>479), which, so far as I have discovered, has been overlooked, or, at all events, does not appear to have been noticed in the subsequent consideration of the question.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">That was a case of manslaughter. The prisoner was found guilty, and a motion was subsequently made to set the verdict aside, on the ground of misconduct in the jury while in charge of a deputy sheriff, which was denied. After judgment, an application for a writ of error was made and refused. It appeared on that application that the examination of the witnesses having been protracted to a late hour of the first day of the trial, and the attorney of the commonwealth being unable, from defect of sight, to proceed further, the jury were, with the consent of the prisoner, committed to two deputy sheriffs' attending court, who were sworn to keep them together without separation, and without communication with any other person, or with the officers themselves, except on occasion of <em>indispensable necessity ; </em>and a charge to the like effect was given to the jury. The court then adjourned to the following day, and the jury were confined in the court house. Some time thereafter, one juror, attended by an officer, went to the stable ad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>joining the court house to have his horse fed. The next morning he did the same thing, then went to a store in the vicinity, and bought a small article. He also sent a message to his wife, explaining the cause of his detention. Two other jurors were permitted, at night, to go to the bar of the tavern in the neighborhood. One of them drank a glass of brandy and water, and the other a glass of wine. On the next morning the same jurors were again permitted to go to the tavern, and one of them, while there, drank a small glass of julep. Another juror was allowed to separate from the rest to take care of his own horse and that of a fellow juror, and was gone about ten minutes. These different transactions were done in the sight of and near the sheriff.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">The case of McCaul above referred to, was relied on in support of the motion, and Dade, J., in delivering the opinion of the court on its denial, said: \u201c The court could not consider that the rule established in that case, that a separation of the jury without imperious necessity will vitiate the verdict, is to be taken in a sense as exclusive as the words import, but should be understood in reference to the case in hand, according to a sound remark of Lord Ellenborough, in <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Guy (3 East's R., </em>21), \u201c that general language used by the court in giving its opinions in any case, must always be understood with reference to the subject matter before them,\u201d and concludes with the following remark: \u201cIn McOaul\u2019s case there was the utmost facility of corrupting the jury, and in the latter (the case then under consideration), a bare possibility; and on account of a remote possibility, we do not feel ourselves justified to obstruct the justice of the country, where we cannot doubt that the prisoner has received no injury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">In this State, the general opinion, since the decisions in <em>The People </em>v. <em>Douglas </em>(4 <em>Cow., </em>26), and <em>The People </em>v. <em>Ransom </em>(7 <em>Wend., </em>417), until questioned by Justice Selden, in <em>Eastwood </em>v. <em>The People, supra, </em>has been, that the mere separation of a jury, although in a capital case, would not of itself be sufficient cause for setting aside the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>After an expression of dissent by that eminent jurist (although not necessarily affecting the result in the case at bar), the question is considered of sufficient importance to justify a short review of the different cases, and, with an unfeigned respect for Ms opinion, it does not appear to me to be justified by the authority of the case relied on by Mm.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">His conclusion is based on what is stated by him to be a direct decision of the Supreme Court, confirmed, as he claims, by a reference to it by Chief Justice Spencer,'hr his opinion in <em>The People </em>v. <em>McKay </em>(18 <em>Johns., </em>212), decided in 1820. The only evidence of such decision is contained in that opinion where, <em>arguendo, </em>the judge makes the following remarks: \u201cA case analogous in principle occurred in Ontario county, in 1814. A woman of color was indicted and tried for murder, and found guilty. The jury had separated <em>after agreeing </em>on their verdict, and before they came into court, and on that ground a new trial was granted, and she was tried again.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">There is nothing to show what causes led to the separation, or under what circumstances it took place. It may have been an act of great abuse, produced by improper means and with corrupt practice. It was certainly, from the naked facts stated, a gross violation of duty. The case had been submitted for their consideration, and the life of the prisoner was dependent on the result of their deliberation. According to the well . established rules, they were to be kept together until they had agreed on and returned their verdict. Their separation after such directions, evinced a disregard of their obligation of duty, and was an act so unprecedented-\u2014as well to have justified a conclusion by the court, independent of any other circumstances \u2014that their action was not only inconsistent with a proper administration of justice, and contrary to their duty to the court, but was of itself evidence of such improper conduct as at least to justify a reasonable suspicion of abuse. The question under consideration by the learned justice, when making the remark above quoted, was whether a new trial could be awarded for a capital felony, where the judgment had been arrested, and the case referred to was cited as an authority in support of that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>position, and cannot with, propriety be extended beyond the principle for which it was cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">The cases of <em>The People </em>v. <em>Douglas </em>(4 <em>Cow., </em>26), <em>The People </em>v. <em>Ransom </em>(7 <em>Wend., </em>417), must therefore be considered as unaffected by the decision in <em>Eastwood </em>v. <em>The People.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">The effect of a separation of jurors, in a capital case, was one of the questions involved in <em>The People </em>v. <em>Douglas, </em>although it is true that the judges, in granting a new trial, placed their decision on the ground that they had been guilty of improper conduct in drinking ardent spirits.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-7\">An opinion deliberately expressed on the main question is not to be considered an <em>obiter dictum </em>merely, but is entitled to consideration as authority. So considered, the case of <em>The People </em>v. <em>Douglas </em>sustains the doctrine clearly and distinctly in the opinion delivered by Judge Woodworth, that a mere separation of a jury, without further abuse, although in a capital case, would not of itself be sufficient cause for setting aside a verdict, and is fully and expressly recognized as an authority for that position in <em>The People </em>v. <em>Ransom, </em>by Justice Sutherland, although it is suggested by Justice Selden, in his opinion above referred to, that he could only \u201cbe considered as having given a <em>quasi </em>assent \u201d to it, while concurring in the result of the opinion expressed by Judge Woodworth.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-8\">It is also to be remarked, that in the great majority of cases (and indeed there are very few exceptions) where the question has been presented, the courts have placed their decisions in setting aside verdicts and granting new trials, on the grounti of abuse, and not in the mere fact of separation, a circumstance of itself an authority against the sufficiency of the latter ground. If that was sufficient, it would have been unnecessary to have considered the question of abuse at all. The result therefore is, that the weight of authority is decidedly in favor of the power of the court to permit a separation in all felonies without any exceptions. If, however, there could have been doubt on the question, considered as one to be governed by the authority of judicial decisions, it appears to be entirely removed in this State by a positive statute, which declares that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>\u201c the proceedings prescribed by law in civil cases, in respect to the impanneling of jurors, <em>the Iceeping them </em>together, and the manner of rendering their verdict, shall be had upon the trial of indictments.\u201d (2 <em>B. iS., </em>735, \u00a7 14.) The provision is general, and without any qualification or restriction whatever. That statute was passed several years after the case of <em>The People </em>v. <em>Douglas </em>was decided, and, it is to be assumed, with full knowledge of it, and the authorities cited in that case, including that of <em>The Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McCaul.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">The power of the court to permit a separation in civil cases, is undoubted, and it is constantly exercised, and had been long previous to the passage of that statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">It is also conceded to be the rule, that the party who seeks to avoid a verdict in a civil case, on the ground that a jury have separated, whether such separation was with or without the authority of' the court, must show, affirmatively, that the separation has, or may probably have had, some effect on the verdict <em>(Eastwood </em>v. <em>The People, supra), </em>and that the rule is the same in cases of misdemeanor, is abundantly settled in this country and in England. (Ib.)</p>\n<p id=\"b506-7\">As the same rule prescribed by law in civil cases, in respect to keeping jurors together, apply to the trials of indictments, and as the trial of indictments for all offences, without reference to their grade, is placed on the same footing and subject to the same regulations, there can be no foundation for the distinction sought to be made in capital cases, even if there were formerly a ground for such a distinction. Nor is there any reason in principle for it. The object of trials by a jury in all cases is the same. It is to ascertain the truth. That is always the same. \u201c The principles of justice are immutable and'eternal.\u201d If a fair and impartial verdict can be obtained in one case after the jurors have separated and gone to their homes, or mixed with their fellow citizens, what foundation is there for the assumption that it cannot be in another ? and what reason can be assigned for sustaining a verdict in a case of a misdemeanor, when it could, upon the same state of facts, be set aside in a case of felony ? The ground on which the dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>tinction has been based is erroneous. It assumes that the tribunal, which is chosen to determine between the public and the citizen on questions affecting the life and liberty of the citizen, is corrupt, or, at all events, is in danger of being influenced by fraud and corrupt practices. Such a doctrine is repugnant to all ideas of a fair and just administration of the laws of the land, and strikes at the very existence of all our civil rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">Sentiments were expressed in <em>Thomas </em>v. <em>The Commonwealth (supra), </em>in reference to officers having the custody of jurors, which may, with the same justice in the present day, without disrespect to such officers, be extended to jurors. He says; \u201c Towards the officers of the law we are not warranted in extending a suspicion of corruption, for if we were to do so, he having many opportunities of corruption, there would be an end to all confidence in many of the most important proceedings in a court of justiceand Justice Eead, in <em>Davis </em>v. <em>The State, </em>in maintaining the right of the court in its exercise of a sound discretion to permit a jury to disperse during the progress of the trial, remarks, that \u201cjurors are now considered as honest men, disposed to discharge the obligations of their oaths and justice, and it is not going very far to presume that they would resist all efforts to corrupt them, as much as a sworn constable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">The jurors, according to the usual practice in this State, are summoned several days previous to- the time designated for holding the courts at which they are required to attend, from a select class of men, specially chosen by public officers designated for that purpose, and are required to be men of known competency, character and integrity, and possessed of property to a prescribed amount. This practice, while it is calculated on the one hand to secure the attendance of honest, fair and competent jurors, on the other hand affords the time and opportunity, both in civil and criminal cases, for tampering with them, and for corrupt appliances to a much greater extent, and with better prospects of success than during the short time usually allowed for obtaining refreshments, or during the ad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>journment from day to day. I may add that in a business community, the continuance of a jury together for the time the case in question occupied, would materially tend to a derangement of business and actual loss, and that a separation under such circumstances, as well as in counties where the means of accommodating jurors are limited, if attainable at at all, would be justified as a case of \u201c evident necessity \u201d fairly within the exceptions to the rule laid down by Blackstone. It might be urged, and in my opinion shown, that the danger growing out of the practice in keeping a jury together, with the inhibitions against talking on the subject of the trial only, while free conversation on other subjects, as well as a transmission of letters, and free access to the newspapers and various publications of the day are tolerated, is far greater than by allowing them to go at large during the adjournment, and attending to their business and domestic avocations; but I deem it unnecessary to discuss this branch of the case further, and conclude with the remark, in the language of the court in <em>State </em>v. <em>Engel (supra), </em>that 'in our day there is no necessity for adhering with tenacity to the doctrines of ancient times. Many of the notions in vogue centuries ago, have yielded to better reason, founded on more enlightened views and greater experience.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">Having come to the conclusion that it was in the power of the court, on its own authority, to permit the jury to separate on the different adjournments during the progress of the trial, it is not material to express our opinion at length on the effect of the consent given by the prisoner to such separations. If it was ineffectual, it cannot vitiate or impair the order of the court authorizing it. I will merely say that I have not seen any reason to doubt the justice of the rule as laid down by Gowen, J., in the case of <em>The People </em>v. <em>Rathbun </em>(21 <em>Wend., </em>542, &amp;c.), that a prisoner <em>\u201c </em>may waive any matter of form or substance, excepting only what relates to the jurisdiction of the court,\u201d and that \u201c any agreement deliberately made, any plain assent, express or implied, in respect to the orderly conduct of a suit, or even an agreement to admit a material fact, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>upon, the trial, cannot be revoked at the pleasure of the party,\u201d \u201c that, even in respect to a trial for felony, the principle is the same as that which binds in civil cases, and that a prisoner on trial in the Courts of Oyer and Terminer,\u201d 11 who defends by counsel and silently acquiesces in what they agree to, is bound the same as any other principal by the acts of his agent.\u201d The obligation of this rule was subsequently enforced in <em>Beebee </em>v. <em>The People </em>(5 <em>Hill, </em>32), where the court refused to allow the withdrawal of a consent given with the approbation of the court, and remarked, that \u201cin respect to the delay of the trial (caused by such consent), and the separation of the jury in the meantime, it is not for the prisoner to take advantage of the irregularity, if it be such, as the indulgence was granted on his application and for his benefit,\u201d although if improper conduct by any of the jurors' had been shown, they would have felt it their duty to interfere and quash the proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">Some other questions were raised, although not discussed at length on the argument, which I will proceed to consider, One was that two of the jurors had been guilty of misbehavior in holding a conversation with Dr. Doremus, a material witness, who had been examined on the part of the prosecution, in the court room, in relation to his testimony. This charge is founded on the affidavit of one witness only, and that under circumstances not entitling it to -much credit. While he undertakes to state so much of the remarks of the Doctor as tend to show an impropriety of conduct on his part, he says that he did not hear the remainder of the conversation.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">The remark stated to have been made by the juror was in relation to a fact which, I think, from the case, it is apparent, admitted of no difference of opinion, and therefore could not prejudice the prisoner. The charge is, however, fully denied by both of the jurors implicated, as well as by the Doctor. There was, therefore, no ground for setting aside the verdict on that account. The refusal of the court to issue an attachment against the witness Stephens, on the application of the prisoner\u2019s counsel, does not affect the verdict or judgment, and is not available as a ground of reversal here, for the following, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>among other reasons: First, The testimony on both sides had been closed, and the court had so announced, and had directed the summing up to proceed. Second, Arrangements had been made by all parties for summing up, which was inconsistent with the introduction of additional testimony. Third, There is nothing in the affidavit, nor in the case, to show that the attachment was applied for with the object of having the witness examined, and no application was made for a delay or postponement of the trial till the return of the attachment. Fourth, If there had been, the examination of the witness at that stage of the case, rested in the discretion of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">It was also objected that the record does not show that the prisoner was present in court during the whole of the trial, nor at the rendition of the verdict. In reference to which, it is to be remarked that it is distinctly stated in the record itself that he was personally present on the impanneling of the jury, and when judgment was rendered; it is also shown by the return to the certiorari, that the jurors were polled on giving their verdict, and that the prisoner was present on every day of the trial previous to that time. There is, therefore, no valid ground for that objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">Several exceptions to the rejection and admission of evidence were taken, which will now briefly be considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-7\">Assuming that those taken to the decisions made as to the exclusion of the papers before Justice Welsh, and as to the questions put to the witness, John Pullman, were well taken at the time they were taken, the objections were obviated by the subsequent introduction of those papers, and by the offer of the District Attorney, made while the witness Pullman was still in court, and before the defence closed their case, that every question that had been propounded by the defence to him, but which had been excluded by the court, might be put to the witness, and answered by him.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-8\">The testimony of Fanny Bell, in relation to the liquids taken by the deceased, and as to th\u00e9 effects of the rice on the witness, was pertinent to the main issue. The question as to the nature of the conversation between that witness and the deceased, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>might have elicited an answer, which, in connection with other testimony, might have been pertinent when put; but if it were otherwise, the answer given to it was immaterial and harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">Doctor Finnell, a witness examined on the part of the defence, was asked whether certaiii symptoms, particularly specified, were symptoms of arsenical poisoning, and he was permitted to answer the question. This was admissible; he had nreviouslv given testimony in relation to the same subject matter, and the question put referred to symptoms of which evidence by other witnesses had been previously given, his opinion as a physician was therefore properly asked and admitted. <em>(See 1 Park. Cr. R., </em>495; 2 <em>Kern., </em>358, &amp;c.)</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">The testimony of Jane Harvey was admissible to rebut that of Susan Hannah, Isabella Bennett and Maria Hannah, given on behalf of the prisoner, on their direct examination; and that of Michael Thornton and John Biscoe was also properly received for the same object.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-7\">The motion to strike out the testimony of\" Henry Maxwell and Charles Mulholland was properly overruled. The evidence related to the conduct of the witness Bell, which had been attacked by the defendant, and was therefore admissible; but conceding it to have been immaterial, as is claimed, the refusal to strike it out cannot avail the prisoner here. It had been taken without objection, and it was too late afterward to object to its effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-8\">The objection taken to the examination of William Knox, was not well founded. The avowed object of the prosecution in calling him, was to rebut the evidence introduced on the defence, which had then been closed. There can be no doubt as to the propriety of admitting him to be examined for that purpose; but if it were otherwise, it was discretionary in the court to permit the examination, and the exercise of that discretion is no valid ground of exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-9\">The admission of the anonymous letter is no ground of reversal; it was sufficiently proved to have come from the prisoner, and it tended to show a motive for the commission of the crime imputed to him; if, however, it were not strictly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>admissible, no exception was taken to its introduction when produced; and if there had been, all objection to it was removed by the subsequent production of the papers used before Justice Welsh, including the letter in question, by the prisoner himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">Exceptions taken to the charge, and refusals to charge on certain propositions submitted by the prisoner\u2019s counsel, remain to be noticed.</p>\n<p id=\"Aeh\">The general exception taken to the charge is clearly unavailable on well-settled rules, and the specific exceptions related to a reference by the judge to certain portions of the evidence, and his comments thereon. The remark, \u201c What will a man give in exchange for his life?\u201d was made a special ground of complaint on the argument; its truth was not denied, but the fact of its being entitled to credit as founded on \u201c the highest authority,\u201d was questioned. That is of very little importance, as the truth of the remark itself is conceded. It is suggested, however, by the judge who made it, that it may be satisfactory, and perhaps useful to the counsel by whom the exception was taken, to refer to Matthew 16: 26, in connection with the context in the further examination of the question by him. It is sufficient to say, in answer to all those exceptions, that the comments and remarks of the court on the testimony, are no ground for exceptions; moreover, the jury were expressly instructed that they were the judges of all questions of fact; that if the court had expressed any opinion upon the evidence, or upon any part of it, that they were still to determine for themselves what the evidence was, what weight was to be given to it, and what effect it should have in the case, giving the prisoner the benefit of every reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-7\">The court was requested by the prisoner\u2019s counsel to charge on six distinct propositions, and he charged as requested on all except the second, which was slightly modified, and that was charged as modified. The original proposition went so far as to exclude the chemical analysis as evidence, if access to the body of Mrs. Stephens, after it was exhumed, could have been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>had by other persons than those who made the <em>post-mortem </em>examination, especially if Robert Bell, one of the witnesses examined on the part of the prosecution, actually had access to and touched it merely, without any further agency or circumstances connected with such access, and that without qualification as to the time.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">This is clearly too broad, and a modification of it by saying that if access could have been had by other persons under such circumstances that they could have applied arsenic, and that if Robert Bell actually had such access and tampered with the body then, that so much of the analysis as was made after the body was so exposed and tampered with, was not competent evidence, was unobjectionable.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">The motions for a new trial and in arrest of judgment, were founded on matters which have already been considered, and need no further consideration. Our conclusion upon the whole case, after a full examination and deliberate consideration, is, that no ground for a new trial is shown. The judgment of the Oyer and Terminer must, therefore, be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-9\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
