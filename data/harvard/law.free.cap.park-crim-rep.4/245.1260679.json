Weston.\u201d The note and receipts were set forth in <em>haec verla. </em>The note was as follows: \u201c On or before the first day of March next, I promise to deliver A. Lainey, or bearer, one hundred dollars\u2019 worth of hemlock lumber, at Martin\u2019s Corners, at the wholesale prices, it being half payment of the $200 mentioned in a certain mortgage this day executed in favor of said Lainey mentioned, money down, for which said Lainey agrees to take lumber instead of money,\u201d and was dated January 21, 1854. The form of describing the several receipts was as follows: \u201cOne receipt for the payment of the sum of fifteen dollars and forty-six cents, and of the value of fifteen dollars and forty-six cents, which said receipt was in the words and figures following, to wit: \u201c Buffalo, Mch. 3d, 1855.

Weston, Fifteen TW dollars in full for bill lumber, and of all demands to date.\u201d (signed) \u201cDart Brothers.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Avf\">A jury having been impanneled, <em>Galusha Parsons, </em>who had been assigned to defend the prisoner, requested the court to decide that no evidence could be given of the larceny of the so called promissory note, nor of the receipts, for reasons noticed in the following opinion. After hearing <em>James M. Humphrey </em>(District Attorney), the court, with the consent of counsel, permitted the evidence to be given, reserving its decision until the following morning, and then delivered the following opinion:</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b246-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>Clinton, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ayu\">At common law, no chose in action, evidence of debt, or voucher of payment, was the subject of larceny, but under our statutes the common law definition of that crime has been greatly expanded. The Revised Statutes (2 <em>JR. S., </em>679, \u00a7 63) define grand larceny to be \u201cthe felonious stealing, taking and carrying away the personal property of another, of the value of more than twenty-five dollarsand (_ZZ&gt;., 690, \u00a7 1) petit larceny, as the \u201c stealing, taking and carrying away the personal property of another, of the value of twenty-five dollars or \"under.\u201d The section of those statutes (lb., 679, \u00a7 66) cited by the prisoner\u2019s counsel last evening, does not, as he supposed, define the subjects of larceny other than goods or chattels, but merely fixes, by arbitrary rules, their values. The definition is furnished by another section (lb., 702, \u00a733), which is as follows: \u201c The term 1 personal property,\u2019 as used in this chapter, shall be construed to mean goods, chattels, effects, evidences of right in action, and all written instruments by which any pecuniary obligations, or any right or title to property, real or personal, shall be created, acknowledged, transferred, increased, defeated, discharged or diminished.\u201d This definition and the definitions of larceny, grand and petit,\" are in the same chapter; and larceny, under our Revised Statutes, includes the stealing, taking and carrying away of any written instrument, by which any pecuniary obligation is discharged or diminished. A release of the whole, or of a part of a pecuniary obligation (or debt, as we understand the term), does discharge or diminish it; but a simple receipt does not. Payment, partial or in full, does; and the receipt is a mere written acknowledgment and evidence of the payment. A simple receipt is not a written instrument in the ordinary legal acception of that word. It has no active operation, but is simply evidence. It is not capable of enforcement, but is a shield. As before remarked, the provision cited by counsel (\u00a7 66) \"does not profess, and cannot be permitted, to enlarge this definition. It uses the word \u201c receipt,\u201d but that word is used in various senses, both in common and commercial parlance, and in the law. The section, as respects receipts, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>reads thus: \u201cIf the property stolen consist of any receipt, or any other evidence of debt, the money due thereon or secured thereby, and remaining unsatisfied, or which in any event or contingency might be collected thereon, or the value of the property transferred or affected thereby, as the case may be, shall be deemed the value of the article so stolen.\u201d There is nothing in this language which can be applied to a creditor\u2019s written acknowledgment of payment by his debtor. Such an acknowledgment, or receipt, is not an evidence of debt; no money is due thereon, nor can, in any contingency, be collected thereon, nor is any property transferred or affected thereby. But there are receipts known to commerce and the law which are the subjects of larceny under our statutory definition. Such are \u201c accountable receipts,\u201d or receipts for money to be accounted for; receipts for property in store, and ship receipts. A ship receipt is the written acknowledgment of the mate receiving cargo, acknowledging the receipt of goods on board the vessel, describing them by the marks upon them or the packages. In delivering the judgment of the Court of Appeals, in <em>Brower </em>v. <em>Peabody </em>(3 Kern., 121), Gardiner, Ch. J., sanctioned the distinction we recognize. Speaking of ship receipts, he said: \u201cThe act of Lovett, through which the defendant is compelled to make title, was a felony, for which he could have been indicted and convicted, under the 66th section of the article \u2018Of robbery, embezzlement and larceny.\u2019 If the custom or usage which lies at the foundation of the defence, is valid, the receipts were property, and the value of the commodity affected or transferable by the instrument would be deemed the value of the article so stolen.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">But, while we are of opinion that the receipts set forth in the indictment are not subjects of larceny, we are very clear that the note payable in lumber is. Though it is not negotiable, it is still \u201c a promissory note.\u201d Hot being within the statute, it is a mere contract, and a consideration to support it, if one be not apparent on its face, could not be presumed; and it would, perhaps, have been the duty of the district attorney, in that case, to show, by the averment of a consideration, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>it was property within the meaning of the statutory definition. But it shows a consideration on its face. It is expressed to be in half payment of an admitted debt of $200.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">Being payable to Lainey or bearer, it was transferable by Lainey by mere delivery. Indeed, being a mere chose in action, if the words \u201c or bearer \u201d had been omitted, it would still have been so transferable. But a written assignment of it by Lainey to Weston has been proven. The prisoner\u2019s counsel objects that no such transfer or assignment is averred in the indictment. That merely avers that it was the property of Weston when stolen. He also' claims that the indictment is defective, because it does not, in reference to this note or contract, aver, in the words of section 66, that a demand was created thereby, not that the demand was unsatisfied at the time of the taking by the prisoner. A recurrence to the decisions as to the form of indictments for stealing bank notes, sufficiently shows that, in the opinion of this court, the enlargement of the definition of larceny by substituting \u201c personal property \u201d for-\u201cgoods and chattels,\u2019\u2019 was not intended further to change or complicate the simple form of- an indictment at the common law. If the indictment shows that the note, bill, receipt, or instrument alleged to have been stolen was personal property, and avers that it was the personal property of a person named, or to the jurors unknown, it is sufficient.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
