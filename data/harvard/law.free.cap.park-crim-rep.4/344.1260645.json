The prisoner secretly opened his knife, whereupon the deceased again struck at the prisoner, and again retreated. The prisoner then struck the deceased with the knife, and cut him in the face. The deceased continued to flee, and the prisoner was approaching the deceased, when Kirby ran in between them. The prisoner then struck at Kirby with the knife, but the latter jumped out of the way, and the prisoner foEowed the deceased. One of the brothers of the deceased eafled out to him to take care or he would be kiEed, and as the deceased looked around to see his danger, the prisoner struck the knife into his temple with such force, that after three unsuccessful attempts to draw it out, he fled, leaving the knife sticking in the head of the deceased. The death of the deceased was caused by the last blow. It was <em>held </em>that these facts were sufficient to warrant the conclusion that the prisoner had formed the determination to take the life of the deceased before he struck the last blow, and a new trial was denied.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b344-6\">On the 2d day of February, 1860, the defendant was convicted in this court of the murder of one John Leary. A motion was made for a new trial, on the ground that the verdict was against evidence. The facts sufficiently appear in the opinion of the court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b344-7\"><em>Henry L. </em>Clinton, for the defendant, made the following points:</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b344-8\">I. This court possesses the power to grant new trials upon the merits. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Stone, </em>5 <em>Wend., </em>39; <em>People </em>v. <em>Morrison, </em>1 <em>Park. Cr. R., </em>625; <em>People </em>v. <em>Carnel, </em>1 <em>Park. Cr. R., </em>256; <em>People </em>v. <em>Court of Sessions of Wayne County, </em>1 <em>Park. Cr. R., </em>370.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b345-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>II. The verdict in this case is contrary to law, and overwhelmingly against evidence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b345-5\">From the undisputed facts in the case, and on the testimony for the prosecution, taking it in its worst phase against the prisoner, no more than a case of manslaughter was proven. The death of the deceased occurred in a sudden affray, the prisoner and deceased having exchanged blows before any knife was used by the prisoner; there being no evidence of any old grudge or ill-feeling on the part of prisoner towards deceased prior to this sudden-combat.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b345-6\">It appears from all the evidence in the case, that during the affray no one except the deceased used any violence upon the prisoner. The latter was stabbed during the affray, and it was observed by the officer when he got him to the station house, that he was bleeding from behind the ear. That he had been cut there appears from the testimony of Spencer, Ellen Connolly and officer Sherlock. It appears from the whole evidence of the prosecution, that no blow was struck by prisoner or deceased after the former had inflicted the fatal stab upon the latter. This being so, it follows inevitably that the deceased previously <em>cut </em>the prisoner.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b345-7\">Even had the deceased stabbed the prisoner after he (deceased) had received the fatal blow, this would demonstrate that the deceased had a knife upon that occasion, with which he fought the prisoner. He must have had it open and used it before, for it is not at all probable that after he himself had been fatally stabbed, and the knife stuck in his temple, he could coolly take out his own knife, open it, pursue the prisoner and stab him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b345-8\">Upon the facts appearing in the evidence, the law clearly and unmistakably fixes the offence as no more than manslaughter. From those facts the law presumes the absence of premeditated design or malice aforethought, and it has been so adjudged, repeatedly and uniformly.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b345-9\">Whether certain facts amount to a sufficient provocation to reduce the crime of killing from murder to manslaughter, is a question of law. <em>(State </em>v. <em>Craton, </em>6 Iredell, 164.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b346-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>What is a sufficient provocation to make that which would otherwise be murder, a less offence, is a question of law. <em>(State </em>v. <em>Durno, </em>18 <em>Miss.; </em>3 Bennett, 419.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b346-5\">The fact that the prisoner interfered in the quarrel or fight between the deceased and Smith, makes no difference, so far as the question of manslaughter is concerned.-</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b346-6\">\u201c And of the like offence [manslaughter] shall he be adjudged guilty, who, seeing two persons fighting together in a private quarrel, whether sudden or malicious, take part with one of them and kills the other.\u201d (1 <em>Hawk.

The indulgence which the law extends to cases of this description, is founded on the supposition that a state of sudden and violent exasperation is generated in the affray, so as to produce a temporary suspension of reason, and that the transport of passion excludes the presumption of malice. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Garretson, et </em>al, 2 <em>Wheeler's C. </em>C., 347; <em>U.

Some strangers in another box abused the Scotch nation, and used several provoking expressions towards the soldiers, on which one of them, the prisoner, struck one of the strangers with a small rattan cane, not bigger than a man\u2019s little finger. The stranger went out for assistance, and in the meantime an altercation ensued between the prisoner and the deceased, who then came into the room, and who, on the prisoner\u2019s offering to go without paying his reckoning, laid hold of him by the collar, and threw him against a settle. The altercation increased, and when the soldier had paid the reckoning, the deceased again collared him and shoved him from the room into the passage. Upon this the soldier exclaimed that he did not mind killing an Englishman more than eating a mess of crowdy. The deceased, assisted by another person, then violently pushed the soldier out of the house, whereupon the latter immediately turned round, drew his sword, and stabbed the deceased to the heart. It was adjudged manslaughter.\u201d <em>(Wharton's Crim. </em>Law, <em>4th Rev.

Upon this ground, the defendant is entitled to a new trial.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b351-5\"><em>Nelson J. Waterbury </em>(District Attorney), on behalf of the People, contended that the verdict was fully sustained by the the evidence.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b351-6\"><em>By the Court, </em>Ingraham, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ad5\">The counsel for the prisoner moves for a new trial, on the ground that the verdict is against evidence, and that the facts proven only warranted a conviction for manslaughter. Upon the trial of the cause, the jury were fully instructed as to the distinction between murder and manslaughter, and they were also told in what cases the killing of the deceased could be justified or excused. To the charge no exceptions whatever were taken, and the jury was also charged as requested by the prisoner\u2019s counsel on all these points. There can be, therefore, no ground for asking a new trial for errors of law in the judge\u2019s charge. The only question, therefore, proper for me to consider upon this motion is, whether the facts as proven will sustain the verdict finding the prisoner guilty of murder. I feel very much at a loss to draw any distinction between this case and that of <em>Shorter </em>(2 <em>Comst., </em>193). In that case the parties engaged in a sudden affray in the street. Uo one interfered. After several blows, the deceased discovered that Shorter had a knife, and retreated. The prisoner followed him, and blows passed between them until he got to the middle of the road, when the deceased fell and died. There was no positive evidence of blows by the prisoner with the knife; but upon evidence that the prisoner carried a knife, and that the deceased had several wounds on his body, given by a knife, the prisoner was convicted of murder, and that conviction was sustained. In the present case, the evidence against Shay is of a more positive character, and if the case of Shorter was one justifying a charge of murder, there can be no doubt but that the facts in this case would warrant a similar verdict. The deceased and one Smith were quarreling <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>and Shay interfered. He struck the deceased the first blow on the head; this blow was returned by the deceased, who then retreated, followed by Shay. Shay secretly opened his knife, which led the deceased again to strike at Shay, and again to retreat. There is evidence that the deceased at that time had nothing in his hand, and some evidence from Corbel that he had a knife. The latter evidence, both from the character and the appearance of the witness, I think the jury might have very properly refused to believe. The question of fact arising thereon was left to the jury. After this Shay struck at the deceased with a knife, and cut him in the face with it. The deceased continued to flee, and Shay was approaching the deceased when .Kirby ran in between them. The prisoner struck at Kirby with the knife, who jumped out of the way, and the prisoner then followed the deceased. One of his brothers called out to him to take care, or he would be killed, and as the deceased looked around to see his danger, the prisoner struck the knife into his temple with such force as to render it so fast there that with three attempts to pull it out made by the prisoner, he was unable to do it, and he then fled, leaving the knife sticking in the head of the deceased. Under these facts the question was submitted to the jury, whether the prisoner, before striking the last blow, had formed the determination to take the life of the deceased ? The facts, in my judgment, were fully sufficient to warrant said conclusion. He was the aggressor. He used a knife when the deceased had none; he opened the knife secretly. After the blow he gave had been returned, he pursued the deceased; he threatened and attempted to stab Kirby who interfered; he again pursued the deceased while running, and he struck such a blow as no one would have struck in such a place if he had not determined to take life. In Shorter\u2019s case, the Court of Appeals held, that under such a state of facts, the question whether the homicide was justifiable or not, could not arise, and there was no color even for submitting that question to the jury, and that where the proper instructions were given to the jury between murder and manslaughter, and the jury found the prisoner guilty of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>murder, the judgment should be affirmed. In <em>The People </em>v. <em>Clark </em>(3 <em>Seld., </em>394), which was a case similar to this in the interference between others who were engaged in a conflict, the court say, \u201cIf there be sufficient deliberation to form design to take life, and to put that design into execution by destroying life, there is sufficient deliberation to constitute murder, no matter whether the design be formed at the instant of striking the fatal blow, or whether it be contemplated for months. It is enough that the intention precedes the act, although that follows instantly.\u201d So also in <em>The People </em>v. <em>Sullivan </em>(3 <em>Seld., </em>396).</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">Motion for new trial denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
