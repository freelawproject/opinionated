The defendant then was brought before a justice of this court on <em>habeas corpus. </em>It is not the province of that writ to review errors in the adjudication of an inferior tribunal, nor the sufficiency of evidence before it; it is only to ascertain whether there was jurisdiction to pronounce the sentence of commitment, and whether the commitment is in due form.
