D. SHAKER, <em>District Attorney.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b64-6\">The prisoner pleaded not guilty, and the cause came on for trial in said Court of Sessions, on the 13th of March, 1858.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b64-7\">After the district attorney had introduced the evidence in behalf of the prosecution and rested the case, the counsel for the prisoner insisted that a conviction for assault and battery <em>with intent to kill </em>could not be had, on the ground that there was not sufficient evidence of such intent, and asked the court so to direct the jury. But the court refused so to direct the jury, and decided that the evidence was sufficient; to which ruling the counsel for the prisoner excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b64-8\">Witnesses were then examined on the part of the prisoner, and further testimony taken on behalf of the prosecution. '</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b64-9\">After the evidence was closed, the counsel for the prisoner again insisted that a conviction on the aforesaid indictment could not be had for assault and battery with intent to maim, or for assault and battery with intent to kill, on the ground that there was not sufficient evidence of said intent, and asked the court so to direct the jury, whereupon the court refused so to do, but decided that the evidence <em>was sufficient; </em>to which ruling of the court the counsel for the prisoner excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b64-10\">The counsel for the prisoner also asked the court to charge the jury that, as the evidence in the case shows that an injury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>of the kind proven might be produced by a blow or blows with the fist, that the jury ought not to infer that the injury was occasioned by a blow or blows with a deadly or dangerous weapon in the absence of proof that such weapon was used. The court refused so to charge. To which decision the counsel for the prisoner excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b65-5\">The court, however, did charge the jury, that if it was likely or probable that the injury to Best could have been produced by the fist, then the jury were not authorized to presume a weapon was used.' That in criminal cases the prisoner was entitled to the benefit of any reasonable doubt, and if the jury had any reasonable doubt as to his participation in the occurrence, they should acquit him; and if they had any reasonable doubt as to the intention to kill, they could only convict him of an assault and battery, provided they came to the conclusion that the defendant participated in the transaction.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b65-6\">The jury found the prisoner guilty of an \u201c assault and battery with intent to kill.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b65-7\"><em>Amasa J. Parker, </em>for the prisoner.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b65-8\">I. The court erred in deciding when the People rested, and again when the evidence was closed, that <em>there was sufficient </em>evidence of an intent to kill. This was decided <em>as matter of law </em>in the presence of the jury, and was in fact a charge to the jury. This decision convicted the defendant of felony. The court had no right thus to decide a question of fact. The court did not decide that there was sufficient evidence to go to the jury, but sufficient to convict. The existence of an intent to kill is a question of faqt and not of law.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b65-9\">II. There was not a particle of evidence of an intent to kill, nor any evidence from which it could legally be inferred. 1. The law presumes that \u201c a man intends the natural consequences of his own acts \u201d\u2014that is, that a man intended to do what he did do\u2014nothing more. <em>(Wharton's Am. Cr. L., 3d ed., </em>331, 292.) The defendant committed an assault and battery; he did not kill. The law will presume he intended to commit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>an. assault and battery, and no more. If any intent beyond the act done is claimed, it must be proved by <em>additional </em>circumstances, as that the prisoner had previously threatened to kill; that he used a deadly weapon, and aimed at a vital part of the body; that he had lain in wait for him, and secretly watched him, &amp;c., &amp;c. <em>(Barb. Cr. </em>Law, 87, 88; <em>Arch. Cr. Pl., </em>104.) 2. Here is not only an absence of all such additional circumstances, but the circumstances of the transaction show that 'there was no intent to kill. Would a person intending to take life strike on the side of the jaw ? And with his fist ? Would he act without secrecy, in a public place, with witnesses all around in sight and hearing ? Does any one believe that Davis really intended to kill Best ? 3. There is no proof that defendant had a weapon of any kind, and the law will not presume it, especially when a witness states that jaws have been broken in prize fights with the fist. 4. \u201c The intent forming the gist of the offence must be specifically proved.\u201d <em>(Wharton Am. Cr. L., </em>551; 3 <em>Harrington, Del., </em>577; 13 <em>Smedes &amp; Marsh, </em>242; 24 <em>Miss., </em>54; <em>Addison R., Penn., </em>30.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b66-5\">III. The jury found the defendant guilty of an assault and battery <em>with intent to kill. </em>The verdict makes no reference to the indictment to help it out. There must be something more than an intent to kill. It must be an assault made with firearms or an air-gun, or any deadly weapon, \u201c or by such other means or force as was likely to produce death.\u201d (2 <em>B. B, </em>665, \u00a7 36.) This is a necessary ingredient of the crime. A <em>mere intent </em>is not punishable in earthly tribunals. They take cognizance only when the intent is displayed in certain prescribed and very dangerous <em>overt </em>acts. It will not be claimed that striking with the fist on the side of the jaw was such means as was <em>likely </em>to produce death. The court, as well as the jury, evidently overlooked the requirements of the statute.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b66-6\">IV. The court erred in refusing to charge as requested, viz.: that as it was proven the injury might be produced by a blow of the fist, the jury ought not, in the absence of proof, to infer that a deadly or dangerous weapon was used. There can be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>no protection for the innocent if the most material fact constituting the crime can be inferred in the absence of proof.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b67-5\">V. The jury should have convicted of an assault and battery only, and not of a felony punishable by ten years\u2019 imprisonment ; and the proceedings should be reversed and a new trial ordered.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b67-6\"><em>J. D. Shafer </em>(District Attorney), for the People.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b67-7\">I. The prisoner was legally convicted of an assault and battery with intent to kill. 1. The jury had a right to infer from the evidence that a dangerous weapon was used. 2. It appears from the evidence that both Davis and Dumond had had previous difficulty with Best, and that he apprehended an attack from them. 3. It was done on a dark and stormy night. The expression used by one of them to the other, just before the assault, as well as at the time of it, shows the existence of' a concerted murderous design between them. 4. The associations and conduct of the prisoner at that time and previous, warrant the same conclusion.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b67-8\">II. If a deadly weapon is used, an intent to kill is to be inferred. If no weapon is used, then the question is, was there excessive violence. Prom continued violence and much beating, an intention to kill may be inferred. (The case of <em>Macklin and others, 2d Lewin\u2019s Crown </em>Cases, 225; 4 <em>Black. Com., </em>200.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b67-9\">HI. The act, taken together, shows malice, and had a fatal result attended it, it would have been murder. (9 <em>Metcalf </em>93; 13 <em>Wend., </em>159; 1 <em>Rus. on Crimes, </em>614, <em>note </em>1.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b67-10\">TV\". The jury found, as a question of fact, that the prisoner did the act with intent to kill; that verdict is conclusive. 1. Where the question is one of doubt, a new trial will not be granted. (5 <em>Wend., </em>48; 2 <em>Wend., </em>352; 4 <em>Yerger, </em>152; 1 <em>Cow., </em>251; 11 <em>Cow., </em>440; 6 <em>Cow., </em>682; 2 <em>Price, </em>282; 1 <em>Burr., </em>54.) 2. The question of malice and intent to kill, if a question of fact or a mixed question of law and fact, is a question for the jury. <em>(Wharton's Crim. Law, </em>637; 2 <em>Scott, </em>369; 2 <em>Stew. &amp; Porter, </em>193; 1 <em>Greenl. R., </em>135.) 3. The finding of the jury is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>conclusive on a question of fact, although it appear affirmatively that the bill of exceptions contain all the evidence. <em>(Colt </em>v. <em>The People, </em>1 <em>Park. Crim. R., </em>621, <em>per Chan. Walworth.) </em>4. That the prisoner used a dangerous weapon may well have been inferred by the jury, if such inference was necessary to convict of assault and battery with intent to kill. The verdict in that case is clearly final. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Vinegar, </em>2 <em>Park. Crim. R., </em>24.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b68-5\">V. The prisoner was legally convicted of assault and battery with intent to kill, even if the crime, in case of Best\u2019s dying of the wound, would have been manslaughter only. (1 <em>Park. Crim. R., </em>327.) The change of the words <em>\u201c </em>to murder,\u201d in the Revised Laws, to the words \u201c to kill,\u201d in the Revised Statutes, shows an intention of the Legislature to extend the meaning of the term \u201c to kill \u201dto any of the ^various degrees of felonious homicide.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b68-6\">YI. The court cannot be required to give an opinion or direct the jury on \u2022 a mixed question of law and fact, and a refusal to do so is no error. <em>(Wharton's Crim. Law, </em>637; 2 <em>Scott, </em>359; 2 <em>Stew. &amp; Porter, </em>193; 1 <em>Greenl. R., </em>135.) 1. The office of a bill of exceptions in criminal cases, is to bring up for review questions of law only, made and decided on the trial. (20 <em>Par. R., </em>597.) 2. Ho bill of exceptions can be taken in criminal cases to authorize a superior court to correct an erroneous opinion of the court below, or the decision of a jury upon a matter of fact. The remedy for the parly who is injured by an erroneous finding of a jury on a question of fact, is an application for a new trial on a writ of error. (11 <em>Wend., </em>557; 14 <em>Wend., </em>546, <em>and cases there cited.)</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b68-7\">YU. For offences greater than misdemeanor, a new trial cannot be granted on the merits, whether the accused be convicted or acquitted. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Comstock, </em>8 <em>Wend., </em>549; <em>6th Term R., </em>625; <em>Chitty's Crim. Law, </em>532; <em>13th East R.; Barb. Crim. Law, </em>323.)</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b68-8\"><em>By the Court, </em>Gould, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AB9\">As I understand the prisoner\u2019s different requests to charge, they were requests to charge the facts, and were properly refused. And as to the first one, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>where the judge said the evidence was sufficient, it is perfectly apparent, from the connection, that he meant merely sufficient to go to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">But there are inherent in the case much more serious difficulties in the way of the conviction of a felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">The third count of the indictment, to make it in itself good, should have after the word \u201c kick,\u201d the words \u201c with such force as was likely to produce death,\u201d and then a general verdict of \u201cguilty of assault and battery with intent to kill,\u201d <em>as charged, in the third, count of the indictment, </em>would probably be good. And it is worth the while of every district attorney to observe this point, and in framing his indictment for cases of assault and battery, so outrageous as plainly was that in this case, to insert a count on which a conviction that will send to the state prison may be had, without calling on the jury to presume, or find from circumstances hardly warranting such finding, that some unknown deadly weapon was used.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-7\">The offence is strictly a statute offence. (2 <em>B. S., </em>665, \u00a7 36.) \u201c Every person who shall be convicted of any assault and battery upon another, by means of any deadly weapon, or by such other means <em>or force </em>as was likely to produce death, with intent to kill, &amp;c., shall be punished,\u201d &amp;c. And no one can doubt that were a strong man to strike with but his fist a heavy blow on the head of a mere child, thereby inflicting severe injury and intense suffering, whether causing or not causing immediate danger to its life, he would clearly be within both the letter and the spirit of committing an assault and battery by such force as was likely to produce death; and eminently worthy of the state prison, for the longest term the law names, would be so brutal a wretch.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-8\">Still, unless the indictment were formed to meet the case, there could be no such conviction, and merely charging \u201c an intent to kill,\u201d without setting forth some of the means which the statute names, will not warrant a conviction of any offence higher than assault and battery. And in this light, I am unable to see that the verdict is really one finding any grade of crime above an assault and battery; the words <em>\u201c </em>with intent to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>kill,\u201d having added to them no reference to the indictment whereby the finding could be eked out with the statute requisitions, are merely nugatory. The true and proper way of finding a verdict in a case properly charging the statute intent, would be \u201c that the prisoner was guilty of the assault and battery with a deadly weapon with intent to kill,\u201d or \u201cby such force as was likely to produce death, with intent to kill \u201d the person assaulted; and the very least that would make a good verdict of guilty of the higher crime, would be guilty of assault and battery with intent to kill, <em>as charged in the indictment.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">Viewing the verdict, then, as one of assault and battery, I see no course to be taken with it but that sentence be passed for that offence.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">There has been no error for which a new trial should be had, nor is there any conviction of a felony, but there is a perfectly valid conviction of the lesser offence.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-7\">Proceedings affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
