It should have alleged that a complaint was made, an examination had, and that the justice was satisfied, &amp;c. (2 <em>B. S., </em>706, \u00a7\u00a7 2, 3.) If the justice had no jurisdiction to issue the warrant, the constable was not \"bound to execute it. (7 <em>Hill, </em>538; 3 <em>Seld., 199; </em>15 <em>Barb., </em>153.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b228-9\">The jurisdiction of a court of special and limited authority is not to be presumed. It must be averred and proved. (5 <em>Hill, </em>39, 44; 4 <em>Seld., </em>254; 3 <em>Man. &amp; Grang., </em>384; 42 <em>Eng. Com. L., </em>206; 1 <em>Comst., </em>40; 18 <em>Barb. R., </em>260.) It is error to suppose that justices of the peace have any other jurisdiction in criminal matters except that conferred by statute. <em>(Salkeld, </em>406; 5 <em>Bac. Abr., </em>395, <em>Burns' Justice.)</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b228-10\">The offence is not charged in the indictment in the words of the statute, and therefore it must be considered as charging -only a common law offence; in which case it is defective in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>not charging an intent to prevent the course of law and justice. (15 <em>Wend., </em>277.)</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b229-5\"><em>A. Sawin </em>(District Attorney), for the People.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b229-6\">\n<em>By the Court,</em>\n</p>\n<author id=\"ASWPe\">Clinton, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ASa\">The first objection to the indictment is, that it does not show that the justice of the peace who issued the warrant had jurisdiction to do so. The warrant which, it is claimed, recites the facts necessary to confer the power to issue it, is set forth in full. In <em>Bradstreet </em>v. <em>Ferguson </em>(23 <em>Wend., </em>638), which was an action of trespass against a magistrate for issuing a warrant for the plaintiff\u2019s arrest, under the act for the prevention of crime, the Court for the.Correction of Errors held that a formal complaint in writing and upon oath was necessary to confer jurisdiction, but that the recitals in the warrant were <em>prima facie </em>proof of such complaint. In the words of Chancellor Walworth, delivering the opinion of the court: \u201cA recital of a fact of this kind, in a warrant for the arrest of a party, when the magistrate would be guilty of a breach of his official oath if the recital was intentionally false, is presumptive evidence of the truth of such recital, and it lies upon the party denying the jurisdiction which depends on that fact, to show that the recital is false.\u201d This decision disposes of the mere question of evidence, but does not necessarily reach that of pleading. Assuming that the warrant recites all the facts necessary to confer the authority to issue it, the indictment does not aver those facts, but merely shows that the magistrate set them forth in the warrant as true. The People did not in their bill allege that they were true, nor has the grand jury, by finding the bill to be true, found that the magistrate had jurisdiction to issue this warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">Upon this question of pleading, I have no doubt. It is clear that in pleading the judgments or proceedings of inferior courts of special and limited jurisdiction, and of magistrates and officers acting under a statute or special authority, jurisdiction must be averred, and the only query has been whether it was sufficient to aver it in general terms; and that has been settled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>for many years in this State. A general averment of jurisdio tion is not sufficient, but the facts upon which it depends must be averred. <em>(Turner </em>v. Roby, 3 <em>Comst, </em>193.)</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">Justices of the peace were first instituted by 1 <em>TSdw., </em>3, <em>ch. </em>16. Before that there were conservators of the peace of two kinds: first, those who, by virtue of their office, had power to keep the peace, but were known- only by their names of office; and, second, those who were constituted for that purpose only, and were simply called by the name of conservators or wardens of the peace. <em>(Bac. Abr.) </em>In <em>Yarrington's </em>case <em>(Salk., </em>406), it was said: \u201cTheir power is created by act of parliament within the time of memory; and they have no other authority than what is thereby given them.\u201d That they have no common law authority, has been repeatedly, and, I believe, uniformly held to be the law of this State. <em>(Way </em>v. <em>Carey, </em>1 <em>Caines, </em>191; <em>Wells </em>v. <em>Newkirk, </em>1 <em>Johns. C, </em>20; <em>Bigelow </em>v. <em>Stearns, </em>19 <em>Johns., </em>39.) This being so, it was necessary, in order to charge the defendant with a duty, as constable, to execute the warrant, to aver the facts which, and which alone, could confer authority upon the justice of the peace to issue it\u2014 that is, that a complaint was made before him, on oath, that the criminal offence had been committed, that he examined the complainant on oath, and found that there was cause to suspect the person named in the warrant as suspected of its commission, and therefore issued it. (2 <em>R. S, 3ded., </em>793, \u00a7\u00a72, 3.) If there were no such complaint, the magistrate had no jurisdiction, and the warrant was in fact void. If void for mere want of jurisdiction, I am of the opinion that the constable was not-bound to execute it, although the law would have protected him for obeying it.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">On this ground (which was not raised at the Criminal Term), I am of opinion that the defendant is entitled to judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-7\">Judgment reversed, and judgment rendered for defendant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
