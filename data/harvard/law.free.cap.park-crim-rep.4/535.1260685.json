Tuthill having been sworn to testify the truth as to his competency as a juror, testified that he had not formed or expressed any opinion as to the guilt or innocence of the accused, whereupon the challenge for principal cause was overruled. The counsel for the prisoner then challenged him for favor, and it was agreed by and between the counsel for the prisoner and the counsel for the People, that the court should act as trier. The said John S. Tuthill thereupon testified that he had read part of the statements in the papers at the time of the homicide, and had formed a preconceived idea in regard to the prisoner\u2019s guilt or innocence; that he had no bias one way or the other; that his preconceived idea or impression would in no way influence his verdict, but would be governed entirely by the evidence produced on the stand. The court found said challenge for favor untrue, and overruled the same, to which decision the counsel for the prisoner excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b536-7\">The following are the principal facts proved in the case:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b536-8\">The prisoner was married to the daughter of the deceased on the 18th of Hovember, 1858. They boarded for five weeks after the marriage, with Mrs. Petrona Saunders, in Grand street, New York, and afterwards with the family of the deceased. On the afternoon of January 4th, 1859, the prisoner went to Mrs. Saunders, and procured a sword-cane he had- left at her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>house. He pulled out the sword and rolled it up in paper, and took the cane in his hand, saying he was going to have it fixed in Laurens street. On the evening of January 5th, the prisoner and his wife took tea at home, and then went to the house of Mrs. Saunders. They arrived there between six and seven, and soon afterwards the prisoner went out, leaving his wife there. He returned at half-past ten, and after a short time left with his wife; they arrived home at about that time; they went in at the basement door, into the kitchen, where part of the family of the deceased were together; .the prisoner\u2019s wife went immediately up stairs, and the prisoner followed her in five minutes afterwards; the deceased came in soon afterwards with some apples, which his niece, Maria Johnson, put on a plate and took up stairs to a room occupied by the deceased and his wife as a bedroom, which was also used as a parlor; the prisoner and his wife slept in a small room which was entered through that room, and which was lighted from the entry by a small window; the prisoner and his wife, her younger sister Martha, and Maria Johnson, remained together in the parlor until half-past twelve o\u2019clock, singing songs, playing upon the guitar, and eating apples; Maria Johnson and Martha Ournon then returned to the kitchen, where the deceased and his wife were nodding by the fire, the latter having been ironing; and the girls then went up to bed in the attic of the house; the last they heard of the prisoner he was singing and whistling.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b537-5\">About two o\u2019clock the deceased and his wife went up to go to bed, and found the door of their room locked. Mrs. Cur-non looked through the entry window into the prisoner\u2019s room, and saw him standing there. She asked him three times to open the door, but he made no answer. She then asked her daughter, who was sitting up in bed, to open the door, who replied, 11 He won\u2019t let me.\u201d The mother then forced open the door of the outer room, and as she entered it, the prisoner rushed out of the bedroom and stabbed her with the sword he had procured from the house of Mrs. Saunders. His wife then jumped out of bed and escaped up stairs, the prisoner stabbing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>her in the shoulder as she passed. The prisoner then turned upon the deceased, and stabbed him with the sword-cane\u2014the weapon being entirely or partially withdrawn, and immediately pushed in again, so as to make really two wounds together, showing a cruciform cut on the outside. The wounds were such as to cause instantaneous death. The mother also escaped up stairs pursued by the prisoner, and she and the prisoner\u2019s wife, and Maria Johnson, fastened themselves in the garret. The prisoner had forced the door partially open, when Martha Curnon, who had gone down stairs during the disturbance, called out from below. The prisoner turned and pursued her, but his light went out, and she hid in the cellar. While there, she heard him say, \u201c Never mind I\u2019ll catch you and kill you, and kill myself, too.\u201d He remained in the house only some five minutes afterwards, when he left it, went down the alley to the street, slammed the outer gate, returned back into the yard, washed something at the hydrant, and loitered about until near six o\u2019clock in the morning, when he finally left. He escaped from New York, and was subsequently arrested in New Orleans.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b538-5\">When <em>Anrdsetto Lajeunechette, </em>a witness called by the prisoner, was on the stand, the counsel for the prisoner asked him the following question:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b538-6\"><em>Q. </em>Did you at any time after the marriage of Sanchez, give him any information of his wife\u2019s infidelity to him; and if so, when?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b538-7\">This question was objected to by the counsel for the People, and the objection sustained, to which decision the prisoner\u2019s cotmsel excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b538-8\"><em>Sarah Jane </em>Sanchez, the wife of the prisoner, was called as a witness in his behalf, by consent of the counsel for the People, and after testifying, among other things, that the prisoner had not accused her of having improper intercourse with Lajeunechette, was asked the following question:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b538-9\"><em>Q. </em>Did you not state before the coroner, when examined at the inquest, that \u201c last night \u201d (meaning the morning of January 6th), \u201c My husband accused me of having improper intercourse <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>with a man named Annisetto Lajeunechette, and threatened that unless I told the truth he would stab me; he accused me of being a prostitute; I was sitting up in the bed crying at the time; my mother knocked at the door on account of his remarks ; I heard her burst in the door ?\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b539-5\">This was objected to by the District Attorney, and excluded, and the prisoner\u2019s counsel excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b539-6\"><em>Tibulcio Aguillar, </em>a witness called by the defence, testified, that he saw the prisoner, shortly after the homicide, at his store in New York, and conversed with him about the case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b539-7\">The prisoner\u2019s counsel then asked the following question:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b539-8\"><em>Q. \u201c </em>Did he, on that occasion, state to you that he had slept with Mrs. Sanchez on the night of the fifth of January ?\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b539-9\">The District Attorney objected, and it was excluded, and the prisoner\u2019s counsel excepted..</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b539-10\">The prisoner\u2019s counsel then asked the following question:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b539-11\"><em>Q. </em>Did you ever communicate to Sanchez statements made by Annisetto, or by any other person, in regard to the infidelity of his wife ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b539-12\">This was also objected to by the District Attorney, and excluded, and an exception taken by the prisoner\u2019s counsel.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b539-13\"><em>Benjamin </em>Ogden, M. D., called on the part of the defence, testified as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b539-14\">I have examined the head of Felix Sanchez; there is a small scar on his head, the result of an incised wound made by some blunt instrument; I found some little thickening of the membrane, which shows that the wound is some six or eight months old; I have made the human mind a special study; there is such a thing as <em>homicidal mania; </em>it is an affection of the brain, in which the patient, in a frenzied state, has a desire to commit violence on individuals; the exciting causes are violent emotions of the mind; I would classify extreme jealousy as one of these; there are many cases of this kind in the books; there are cases where <em>homicidal mania </em>has been developed suddenly, but generally they sho.w some premonitory symptoms; these are, suspicion, jealousy, vascular excitement, fever, red eyes, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>quick pulse, hurried manner; in many cases of insanity, a person\u2019s best friends are supposed to be his worst enemies.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b540-5\">On his <em>cross-examination, </em>he said: I called at the suggestion of the District Attorney, in company with Dr. Eunney; we had interviews of two hours each to examine as to his sanity; the counsel for the prisoner was there at the time; in the course of that examination, I came to the conclusion that he was sane.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b540-6\">Being further examined by the prisoner\u2019s counsel, he said: A man who has his reasoning faculties and the control of himself, is sane; I heard the testimony as to the homicide.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b540-7\"><em>Q. </em>Judging from your knowledge of Sanchez\u2019s temperament, and the facts and circumstances of this case as you have heard them described in the testimony, do you believe that at the time of the homicide Sanchez was mentally capable of forming a premeditated design to take away life ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b540-8\"><em>A. </em>I can form no opinion; I have doubts on that subject.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b540-9\"><em>Moses H. Munney, </em>M. D., called by the prisoner\u2019s counsel, testified as follows: I am resident physician of the Lunatic Asylum at Blackwell\u2019s Island; I have heard part of the testimony of Mrs. Sanchez, and of her mother, and of one or two other witnesses; I examined Sanchez on the 6th and 9th of this month, perhaps about three hours; as a general principle, where a homicide has been committed, and it can be determined that there is no motive, I should consider it evidence of <em>homicidal mania; </em>but it is extremely difficult to determine the absence of all motive.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b540-10\"><em>Q. </em>Judging from your knowledge of Sanchez\u2019s temperament, and from the facts and circumstances of this case, as you have heard them described in the testimony, do you believe that at the time of the homicide he was mentally capable of forming a premeditated design to take away life ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b540-11\"><em>A. </em>It is a difficult point to decide; if the inception of the idea was immediately followed out, there could of course be no premeditation.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b540-12\"><em>Q. </em>Have you doubts as to that subject in this case?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b540-13\">To this question the counsel for the People objected, and the objection being sustained, the counsel for the prisoner excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b541-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>The witness being <em>cross-examined, </em>testified as follows: Dr. Horwitz was present at the second examination; the prisoner\u2019s counsel was also present, and the Assistant District Attorney was there during a part of the time; he remained there until the examination reached a point at which the prisoner\u2019s counsel decided to advise his client to answer no further questions in his presence; he then withdrew; on this examination I found nothing to convince me of his insanity; I saw no evidence that he ever had been insane.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b541-5\">The jury found the prisoner <em>guilty.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b541-6\">The counsel for the prisoner then moved an arrest of judgment on the following grounds, to wit:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b541-7\">1st. That the indictment does not show upon what part of Harmon Curnon the mortal wound was given.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b541-8\">2d. That there is a variance between the indictment and the evidence; the indictment setting forth but one mortal wound, while the evidence shows that there were two.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b541-9\">The court denied the motion; to which decision the counsel for the prisoner excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b541-10\">Judgment was then pronounced by the court, and the case was brought to this court by writ of error.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b541-11\"><em>William Henry Anthon, </em>for the prisoner.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b541-12\">I. The statute enlarging the jurisdiction of the Court of General Sessions of the Peace of the city and county of New York, provides that in all cases of conviction in said court for a capital offence, or one punishable as a maximum punishment, by imprisonment for life, a writ of error, with a stay of proceedings, shall be a matter of right, and that the appellate court may order a new trial <em>\u201c </em>if it shall be satisfied that the verdict against the prisoner was against the weight of evidence, or against law or that justice requires a new trial, whether any exceptions shaE have been taken or not in the court below.\u201d <em>(Sess. L., </em>1855, <em>ch., p. </em>337, 613.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b541-13\">H. The indictment is defective in this, that it does not state on <em>what part </em>of the body of Harmon Curnon the mortal wound <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>was inflicted, and in this, that there were two mortal wounds, instead of one, as stated.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b542-5\">1. Under the Constitution of the State, a party must be indicted before he can be tried for a criminal offence (with certain exceptions); and under the provisions of the Bevised Statutes he is entitled to a copy of the indictment. <em>(Const., </em>\u00a7 6, <em>3d B. S., </em>1020, <em>5th </em>ed.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b542-6\">2. The indictment, possession of a copy of which the law deems so essential to the prisoner, must describe the offence charged, in all its essential details, in order that the defendant may clearly understand what he is called upon to answer\u2014 may frame his defence accordingly, or may be enabled to plead with accuracy <em>auterfois acquit </em>or <em>auterfois convict.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b542-7\">3. Where the death was by a wound or stroke, the indictment must show with certainty to what part of the body the violence was applied. <em>(Hawk. P. C., book 2, ch. </em>23, \u00a7 82, <em>p. </em>178; 2 <em>Hale P.

Uo omission of any of those circumstances which the law requires to be expressly set forth, can be aided by the conviction of the defendant, and such omission may properly be brought to the notice of the court by a motion in arrest of judgment. <em>(Hawk. P. 0., book 2, ch. </em>23, \u00a7 86, <em>p. </em>179; <em>Whar. Or. L., </em>\u00a73043 ; 2 <em>Black., </em>270.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b542-9\">5. The provisions of the Bevised Statutes (3 R., S., <em>5th ed., </em>1020, \u00a74), in regard to defects of <em>form </em>in indictments, do not meet this case, this being an error of <em>substance. </em>This distinction may be clearly seen by examining the cases of errors of form only. (2 <em>Seld., 50; 3 Park. Cr., 330; 2 Id., </em>208; 8 <em>Barb., </em>547; 3 <em>Id., </em>470; 5 <em>Denio, </em>76; 12 <em>Wend., </em>425.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b542-10\">III. The court below erred in overruling the challenge for favor, in the case of the juror, John S.

The juror testified that he had read the statements in the papers, and had not formed or expressed an opinion, but that he had formed <em>apreconceived idea </em>or impression as to the prisoner\u2019s guilt or innocence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b543-5\">2. The fact that he had formed and expressed <em>an opinion, </em>would certainly exclude him under the decisions in <em>Cancemi </em>v. <em>The People </em>(2 Smith, 501), <em>The People </em>v. <em>Freeman (4th Denio, </em>9).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b543-6\">3. A preconceived idea or preconceived impression is even stronger than an opinion, according to the best lexicographers. <em>(Webster: Idea, impression, opinion.)</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b543-7\">4. The existence of a preconceived idea or impression in the mind, denotes a <em>prejudiced </em>state of feeling, disqualifying the juror, under the rul\u00e9 laid down in the Cancemi case, and at variance with the principle there enunciated: \u201cThat the testimony as to the juror\u2019s state of mind is to be construed with liberality to the defendant, in the humane spirit which pervades our criminal laws, and the rules of their administration.\u201d <em>(The People </em>v. <em>Cancemi, </em>2 <em>Smith, </em>501.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b543-8\">TV\". The court below erred in not allowing the question to be put to Sarah Jane Sanchez as to the facts to which she had testified before the coroner.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b543-9\">1. The witness was the wife of the prisoner, who was examined by consent; it was supposed that she would swear to the same facts to which she had testified before the coroner, and which would have aided the defence by showing the discovery of her adultery, which produced, as is contended, the insane frenzy under which the prisoner acted; instead of which she swore to a state of facts diametrically opposite, thus taking the defence by surprise.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b543-10\">2. It is competent for a party to prove that a witness whom he has called, and whose testimony is unfavorable to his cause, had previously stated the facts in a different manner. (1 <em>Greenl. Ev., </em>492; 2 <em>Bull. N. P., </em>297; <em>Alexander </em>v. <em>Gibson, </em>2 <em>Camp., </em>555; <em>Lowey v. Jolliffe, Wm.

The subsequent admission of the testimony of the witness before the coroner in evidence, did not cure the error excepted to; if she had been compelled to account upon the stand for the discrepancy between her testimony on the two occasions, it could not have failed to elicit the truth in regard to what took place between her and her husband at the very instant preceding the homicide, which produced the temporary frenzy under which he acted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b544-7\">4. Without such testimony, forming strictly a part of the very <em>res gesta, </em>the case is entirely without evidence showing any cause or motive for the act.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b544-8\">5. The witness had given affirmative declarations injurious to the prisoner, inconsistent with her previous declarations, which were favorable to him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b544-9\">6. The question was certainly proper, as tending to refresh the recollection of the witness.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b544-10\">V. The court below erred in not allowing the question to be put to Annisetto Lajeunechette as to his informing Sanchez of his wife\u2019s infidelity to him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b544-11\">1. The theory of the defence being that the act was committed in an insane frenzy, which would, at least, reduce the offence from murder to manslaughter, the causes which produced that frenzy, were, properly, matters of evidence in regard to his condition of mind, in the same manner as intoxication, or any other condition of the man depriving him of the power of knowing what he does, may properly be inquired into in reference to the <em>design </em>with which the act was perpetrated. (T<em>he People </em>v. <em>Eastwood, </em>4 <em>Kern., </em>562; <em>Swan </em>v. <em>State, </em>4 <em>Humph., </em>136.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b544-12\">2. The fact that the prisoner killed the innocent and unoffending father, with whom he had no quarrel, and against whom he bore no malice, affords additional support to the argument, that the act was committed in an insane frenzy, caused by the sudden communication of his wife\u2019s infidelity.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b545-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>VI.

The^test of the sufficiency of an indictment is whether or not it describes the offence charged so as to constitute the crime, as defined by law, and to this end every particular or feature of the crime, as so defined, must be set forth with precision, certainty and consistency, and the whole must fully describe the offence. If this is done so as to present a complete description of the offence, as defined by law, or, in other words, so as to insure \u201c the formality of the indictment,\u201d the indictment is good, and neither an omission, in a case of homicide, to allege any of the means by which the crime was accomplished, as, for instance, the manner of holding the weapon, nor any deficiency in the description of the wound, nor a variance between the averments of the indictment and the proof to sustain it, unless by the variance the particular species of the crime proved, though it may nevertheless be of the same general character, differs from that described, or unless the accused is misled thereby, is fatal to a conviction. <em>(Com. </em>v.

Of what consequence is it, whether the wound was given to the left side or to the right side, below the fifth rib or above the fifth rib, or whether there were two wounds or one, if both or either were mortal? That these minute particulars are not matters of substance, is evident, from the well established rule that, if averred one way in the indictment, they may he proved another way on the trial. To test the objection, let us suppose that the wound, instead of three inches in depth, had turned out to be two inches and three-quarters, would the legal consequence have been an acquittal ? Even the musty records of antiquity furnish no authority for such a proposition. If they did, we should not feel ourselves compelled to follow it. The common law is a progressive science, and one of its leading attributes is adaptation to the circumstances and spirit of the age, and to the common sense of the people, of whose actions it is made the rule, and of whose will it is the presumed exponent. The statute, too, admonishes us to disregard the mere cobwebs of-former days. \u201cHo indictment shall be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>deemed invalid, \u00bfte., by reason of any defect or imperfection in matters of form, which shall not tend to the prejudice of the defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">That the defendant did not consider himself prejudiced, or likely to be prejudiced, by the alleged uncertainty of this indictment, is shown by the fact, that instead of demurring, he went to trial upon it, and had no consciousness of the supposed error until after the verdict of guilty had been pronounced, and he was instructed by his counsel to move in arrest of judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">There are many objections which may be taken before, that cannot be taken after verdict. And the law on that point is the same in criminal as in civil cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-7\">The next suggestion relates to one of the jurors, who, being challenged, said that \u201c he had read part of the statements in the papers at the time of the homicide, and had formed a preconceived idea in regard to the prisoner\u2019s guilt or innocence, but1 had no bias one way or the other; that his preconceived idea or impression would in no way influence his verdict, but would be governed entirely by the evidence produced on the stand.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b553-8\">The court below admitted the juror to be qualified, and it is quite obvious that if jurors are on such grounds to be rejected, it will be impossible at the present day to administer justice in cases sufficiently exciting to inspire a newspaper paragraph. Every male adult, over twenty-one and under sixty, \u201c in possession of his natural faculties, and not infirm or decrepit, of sound judgment and well informed \u201d (and no other can be a juror), must read the news of the day, and must, from such reading, form some \u201c idea orimpression.\u201d If an idea or impression, therefore, is to be a disqualification, no competent juror, at the present time, can be found; for no man, in a land of newspapers, can be \u201c well informed \u201d without reading; or, with a \u201csound judgment,\u201d can read without receiving an \u201cidea or impression.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b553-9\">The case of Gancemi, when last under review in the Court of Appeals, involved two propositions, one relating to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>alleged improper allowance of a juror, and the other to the erroneous charge. All the judges agreed that there was error in the charge, but all did not agree, nor was it necessary to the result that they should, that the juror was improperly admitted. In other words, all agreed in the propriety of a new trial, some on one ground, some on the other, and some on both. The decision, therefore, can hardly be considered as a controlling authority on either of the questions referred to\u2014certainly not to support the proposition for which it is cited in the present case. In its strongest aspect, it went no further than to hold that a juror who had both \u201cformed and expressed an opinion,\u201d which was so fixed that it would require affirmative evidence to dislodge it, was not qualified to sit as an impartial umpire between the people and the prisoner. \u00b0 The case of Cancemi, therefore, although it illustrates, does not dispose of that of' Sanchez, and we think the principle contended for will be found so embarrassing in practice that it should rather be restricted than extended.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">To understand the other points discussed by the prisoner\u2019s counsel, a brief statement of facts is necessary: Sanchez, it appears, only a few weeks previous to the homicide, had been married to Curnon\u2019s daughter, and had taken up his residence in the same house with his father-in-law. The family consisted of Mr. and Mrs. Curnon, their two daughters, and Sanchez. On the night in question, he had possessed himself, for what reason does not appear, of Curnon\u2019s sword-cane, or rather of the sword drawn from the cane, and, with his wife, was in the room of his father-in-law, the old people being below in the basement. Mrs. Curnon says:</p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">My husband and I proceeded up stairs to go to bed, and found the door of the parlor, which was the room in which my husband and I slept, locked; I saw Sanchez standing by his bedside, asT'looked in through the small window at the head of the stairs; I said, \u201c Feely, open the door,\u201d which I repeated three times, but he made no reply; I then spoke to Sarah Jane, who was sitting up in the bed, and said, \u201c Sarah Jane, open the door,\u201d to which she answered, \u201c He won\u2019t let me <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>I put my hand to the door and gave it one shove, and it flew open, which forced me into the room; my husband must have followed me; there was no one there but Sanchez, who bounded out of the bedroom as I came in the door; he rushed upon me, and stabbed me with a sword which he held in his hand; then Sarah Jane jumped out of the bed and passed him; he turned quick and gave her a stab in the shoulder; he then turned upon my husband; I saw my husband\u2019s hand raised; I saw Sanchez make a plunge at him with the sword-cane ; I saw but one blow; in the morning I saw my husband lying dead on the floor, &amp;c.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">Here would seem to have been, in the common acceptation of the term, no \u201cpremeditated design to effect the death of the person killed,\u2019[\u00a1but still the act may be murder. Killing, says the statute, shall be deemed murder \u201c when perpetrated by an act imminently dangerous to others, and evincing a depraved mind, regardless of human life, although without any premeditated design to effect the death of any particular individual.<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> Whoever recklessly uses a murderous weapon, is, in law, responsible for the consequences. The law does not regard the want of inadequate motive as a mitigation or justification, or as evidence of that species of insanity, which makes the perpetrator an irresponsible machine. Mere jealousy, like hatred or malice, may explain, but cannot excuse, the wanton disreregard of human life. The object of penalties is to compel men to control their depraved minds, and to teach them not to yield to frenzied passion. In this view, what defence could it be to say that some person had told the prisoner\u2014falsely, as appears\u2014that his wife had been unfaithful? The rumor communicated to the injured, husband might inflame passion, but, in the case of a \u201c dangerous weapon,\u201d would have no tendency to show any absence of \u201c design to effect death,\u201d so as to reduce the crime from murder to manslaughter. More especially was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>the inquiry irrelevant when the person killed, instead of being the alleged adulterer, was the father of the wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">Is a husband, on being told of his wife\u2019s supposed infidelity, to seize a dagger, and on the instant commence stabbing every person that comes near him, and then to quote the monstrous atrocity of the act, in connection with such rumor, true or false, as evidence of insane frenzy? We think not\u2014and that the question objected to by the public prosecutor, although it might as well have been allowed, was lawfully overruled, and that no injustice has been done by its exclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">The same remark applies to several other questions-which were excluded by the court below.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-7\">A point has been raised as to the testimony of the prisoner\u2019s wife, who, by consent, was permitted to be swqpiSion his behalf, but who, when sworn, stated that her husband did not accuse her of any improper intercourse. This statement being sought to be contradicted by. her answers before the coroner, the District Attorney objected to the question, on the ground that a party cannot impeach his own witness. Such, undoubtedly, is the rule of law. There was, therefore, no legal error in the exclusion. And as to any supposed injustice, it was sufficiently obviated by the subsequent admission of all the proceedings had before the coroner, and among them the following statement:</p>\n<p id=\"b556-8\">My husband accused me of having improper intercourse with a man named Annisetto Lajeunechette, and threatened that unless I told the truth he would stab me; he accused me of being a prostitute; I was sitting up-in bed crying at the time; my mother knocked at the door on account of his remarks; I heard her burst in the door.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-9\">So that if the defendant\u2019s own witness had in fact contradicted herself, both the versions given by her were submitted to the jury, to be weighed as they might deem proper. Which of the two they believed does not appear; but neither, it is clear, warranted, or was deemed to warrant, a verdict of acquittal or of manslaughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>The result is:</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">First. That the indictment, in the particulars excepted to, was sufficient, or that its defects, if any, were merely formal and welfe cured by the statute of amendments and by the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">Second. That the juror objected to, being impartial, within the meaning of the law requiring jurors to be persons \u201c of sound judgment and well-informed,\u201d was properly allowed to be sworn.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-7\">Third. That whether information of his wife\u2019s alleged infidelity was communicated to the prisoner or not, and whether such information, if communicated, was true or not, was an immaterial inquiry, as it in no way tended to justify the homicide, or to ^p?e its grade from murder to manslaughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-8\">Fourth. That neither the evidence excluded, nor the evidence received, had any tendency to show legal insanity, or to exempt the perpetrator of the homicide from responsibility for his acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-9\">Fifth. That the heat of passion, where there is a design to effect death by a dangerous weapon, is no excuse in law, or palliation of the act, although not premeditated and not directed against any particular individual, if the act evinces a depraved \u25a0 mind and a reckless disregard of human life.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-10\">Sixth. That as, therefore, there was no legal error in the rulings of the court below, and tested by the statute \u201cof crimes punishable with death,\u201d no injustice in the verdict of the jury, the application for a new trial must be denied, and the judgment affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-11\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b555-6\"><em> Sed vide, Darry </em>v. <em>The People </em>(2 <em>Park.
