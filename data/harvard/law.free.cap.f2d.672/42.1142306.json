Conclusion _______________________________________________ 04</p>\n<author id=\"b130-15\">HARRY T. EDWARDS, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"A-G\">On June 7, 1979, the Environmental Defense Fund (EDF) petitioned for review of regulations, issued by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), implementing Section 6(e) of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2601-2629 (1976). Section 6(e) of TSCA provides broad rules governing the disposal, marking, manufacture, processing, distribution, and use of a class of chemicals called polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). EDF sought review of three aspects of the EPA regulations. First, it challenged the determination by EPA that certain commercial uses of PCBs are \u201ctotally enclosed,\u201d a designation that exempts those uses from regulation under the Act. Second, it claimed that the EPA acted contrary to law when it limited the applicability of the regulations to materials containing concentrations of PCBs greater than 50 parts per million (ppm). Third, EDF challenged the decision by EPA to authorize the continued use of 11 non-totally enclosed uses of PCBs.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-16\">The oral argument in this case was held on June 6, 1980, and an opinion for the court was issued on October 30, 1980, in which it was held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-17\">(1) no substantial evidence supported the administrative determination by EPA to classify certain polychlorinated biphenyl uses as \u201ctotally enclosed\u201d and therefore exempt;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-18\">(2) no substantial evidence supported the administrative decision by EPA to exclude from regulation all materials containing concentrations of PCBs below 50 ppm; but</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-20\">(3) substantial evidence supported the administrative determination by EPA to allow the continued use of 11 non-totally enclosed uses.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b130-21\"><em>Environmental Defense Fund v. EPA, </em>636 F.2d 1267 (D.C.Cir.1980). As a result of this decision by the court, the parties agreed upon and the court approved a series of new rulemaking proceedings designed to develop the factual bases for an improved approach toward the regulation of PCBs.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-22\">On August 24, 1981, EDF moved for an award of $156,600.00 in attorneys\u2019 fees for its participation in the case. This figure was later amended to $156,248.00. In addition, EDF requested $13,992.00 for the hours devoted by the law firm of Trilling &amp; Kennedy for the preparation of a reply memorandum on the issue of attorneys\u2019 fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-23\">I. THE CHRONOLOGY OF EVENTS PERTAINING TO EDF\u2019S MOTION FOR ATTORNEYS\u2019 FEES</p>\n<p id=\"AjA\">The following list details the sequence of events pertaining to EDF\u2019s motion for attorneys\u2019 fees:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-24\">Aug. 24, 1981 \u2014 Motion of Petitioner EDF for attorneys\u2019 fees (hereinafter <em>\u201cEDF </em>Motion\u201d)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-25\">Sept. 15,1981 \u2014 Opposition of AC Paper &amp; Film Capacitor Section of the Electronic Industries Association to the EDF\u2019s Motions for Attorneys\u2019 Fees (hereinafter <em>\u201cAC Paper Opposition\")</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>Sept. 15, 1981 \u2014 Response of EPA to EDF\u2019s Motion (hereinafter <em>\u201cEPA Response\u201d)</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-4\">Sept. 15, 1981 \u2014 Statement of National Electrical Mfgrs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-5\">Oct. 23, 1981 \u2014 Motion by EDF for leave to supplement motion for attorneys\u2019 fees</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-6\">Oct. 23, 1981 \u2014 Supplementary declarations in support of EDF\u2019s motion for attorneys\u2019 fees (hereinafter <em>\u201cEDF Supplementary Motion\u201d)</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-7\">Oct. 23, 1981 \u2014 Motion of EDF for leave to file its motion for attorneys\u2019 fees out of time</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-8\">Oct. 26, 1981 \u2014 \u201cCorrected\u201d reply memorandum of EDF to EPA\u2019s and Intervenor EIA\u2019s responses in opposition to motion for attorneys\u2019 fees (hereinafter <em>\u201cEDF Reply\u201d)</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-9\">Oct. 29, 1981 \u2014 Respondent\u2019s motion for enlargement of time in which to respond to petitioner\u2019s motion for leave to supplement motion for attorneys\u2019 fees</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-10\">Nov. 9, 1981 \u2014 Order granting enlargement of time requested by EPA</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aq4\">Nov. 10, 1981 \u2014 EPA\u2019s response in opposition to EDF\u2019s motion for leave to supplement motion for attorneys\u2019 fees (hereinafter <em>\u201cEPA Response to Supplementary Motion\u201d)</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-11\">Nov. 20, 1981 \u2014 Reply of EDF to EPA\u2019s Opposition to petitioner\u2019s motion for leave to supplement motion for attorneys\u2019 fees (hereinafter <em>\u201cEDF Reply on Supplementary Motion\u201d)</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b131-12\">The opposition filed by intervenor AC Paper raises three issues. First, it is contended that the 837 hours of experienced lawyer time claimed by EDF appears to be an excessive expenditure of time for this case. Second, it is argued that there is no basis for EDF\u2019s request that its \u201clodestar\u201d fee be adjusted upward by 100%. Finally, it is urged that <em>Petitioner\u2019s Motion </em>should be dismissed because EDF\u2019s request for fees is over nine months out of time. The EPA, although opposing EDF\u2019s motion for fees on several grounds, has not contended that the motion is untimely. EDF, not surprisingly, rejects the claim that its Motion is untimely; however, in an abundance of caution, EDF has filed a \u201cMotion For Leave To File Its Motion for Attorneys\u2019 Fees Out of Time.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b131-16\">The <em>EPA Response </em>to the <em>EDF Motion </em>does not seriously contest the claim for attorneys\u2019 fees.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Rather, EPA makes the following principal arguments:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-17\">(1) The court should strictly scrutinize EDF\u2019s claims for attorneys\u2019 fees. <em>EPA Response </em>at 6-9.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-18\">(2) EDF\u2019s estimated \u201clodestar\u201d fee is substantially exaggerated, both in terms of the \u201cnumber of hours reasonably expended\u201d and the \u201creasonableness of the hourly rate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 12-21.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-19\">(3) No upward adjustment to the \u201clodestar\u201d is warranted. <em>Id. </em>at 21-26.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b131-20\">These arguments duplicate those raised by AC Paper except with respect to the timeliness issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-21\">II. THE APPLICABLE STATUTORY STANDARD FOR AN AWARD OF ATTORNEYS\u2019 FEES UNDER TSCA</p>\n<p id=\"AlD\">Section 19(d), of TSCA, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2618(d), authorizes awards of attorneys\u2019 fees in cases involving petitions for review of regulations brought, as was the instant case, pursuant to section 19(a):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-22\">The decision of the court in an action commenced under subsection (a), or of the Supreme Court of the United States on review of such decision, may include an award of costs of suit and reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees for attorneys and expert witnesses if the court determines such an award is appropriate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b132-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>As was noted in <em>Sierra Club v. Gorsuch, </em>672 F.2d 33 (D.C.Cir.1982), a case involving a comparable attorneys\u2019 fee provision under the Clean Air Act:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-4\">On its face, the statutory provision clearly permits the court to award attorneys\u2019 fees to prevailing, substantially prevailing, or non-prevailing parties in \u201cappropriate\u201d cases.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b132-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 34. The same may be said of the relevant statutory provision in section 19(d) of TSCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">The significance of the attorneys\u2019 fee provision of TSCA may be highlighted by comparison to other statutory fee provisions. For example, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(E) provides that attorneys\u2019 fees under the Freedom of Information Act are available only to a complainant who has \u201csubstantially prevailed.\u201d Likewise, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412(b), covering awards of fees against the United States, provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-7\">Unless expressly prohibited by statute, a court may award reasonable fees and expenses of attorneys <em>... to the prevailing party </em>in any civil action brought by or against the United States or any agency and any official of the United States acting in his or her official capacity.. . .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aqj\">(emphasis added).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In enacting a provision allowing for an award of attorneys\u2019 fees whenever a court finds that such \u201can award is appropriate,\u201d it seems plain that Congress intended to give the courts greater latitude than is allowed under statutes such as FOIA (\u201csubstantially prevailing\u201d) and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412 (\u201cprevailing party\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b132-11\">Albeit sparse, the legislative history surrounding the attorneys\u2019 fee provision of TSCA confirms this reading and offers some guidance in identifying \u201cappropriate\u201d cases. Section 19 in the original Senate and House bills, <em>i.e., </em>the bills that preceded the passage of TSCA in its final form, each contained provisions allowing the courts to award \u201creasonable fees for attorneys and expert witnesses if the court determines that such an award is appropriate.\u201d <em>See </em>S. 3149, 94th Cong., 2d Sess. \u00a7 19(c)(3) (1976); H.R. 14032, 94th Cong., 2d Sess. \u00a7 19(c)(3) (1976), <em>reprinted in </em>Legislative History of the Toxic Substances Control Act, at 136, 384 (1976) (hereinafter \u201cLegislative History\u201d). Although minor modifications were made to section 19 in the conference between the Senate and House Managers of the TSCA bills, the Conference Committee ultimately retained intact the provision allowing for awards of \u201creasonable fees for attorneys and expert witnesses if the court determines that such an award is appropriate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 709.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-12\">The only significant discussion of the attorneys\u2019 fee provision apparently occurred on September 28, 1976, during the Senate\u2019s consideration of the Conference Report. <em>Id. </em>at 721, 727-30. During this discussion, Senator Magnuson, who was the ranking Senate Manager on the Conference Committee, made it clear that the attorneys\u2019 fee provision <em>\u201cis not restricted to plaintiffs or to successful parties.\" </em>Legislative History at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>729 (emphasis added). However, Senator Magnuson made a point of indicating that the attorneys\u2019 fee provision was not without limits:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-4\">It is not the intention of these provisions to provide an award for an individual or a group if that individual or group may stand to gain significant economic benefits through participation in the proceeding.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b133-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 729.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">In addition to his own remarks, Senator Magnuson sought and received consent to print the remarks of Senator Tunney (which had appeared in the Congressional Record of March 26, 1976), as part of the legislative history of section 19. <em>Id. </em>at 727. In his printed comments, Senator Tunney first stated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-7\">[the attorneys\u2019 fee] provision [of TSCA] would allow an award of fees and costs to any party when \u201cappropriate,\u201d a <em>word which should [be] liberally construed to effectuate the purposes of this act.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b133-8\"><em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). Following this initial comment, Senator Tunney added that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-9\">[I]n typical circumstances, the court should follow prevailing case law which holds that a successful plaintiff \u201cshould ordinarily recover in [sic] attorneys\u2019 fee unless special circumstances would render such an award unjust.\u201d ... \u201cPlaintiff\u201d in the [sic] sense is used to mean the parties seeking to enforce the rights granted by this section and can include an intervenor, or a defendant in some cases....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-10\">Where plaintiff\u2019s proceeding is brought in good faith or on the advice of component [sic] counsel, fees and costs would ordinarily be denied to a prevailing defendant .... The standard for awarding fees and costs to a prevailing defendant is not the same as for a plaintiff because, if it were, the risk to the average citizen of bringing suit under this section would be so great it would discourage such suits.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-13\">Fees and costs would be awarded to a \u201csuccessful plaintiff\u201d under this provision where there was a final court order granting the relief requested by plaintiffs, or as a matter of interim relief pending the outcome of the case. The provision does not require the entry of a final order before fees or costs may be recovered.... Such awards are especially important where a party has prevailed on an important matter in the course of the litigation even where he does not ultimately prevail on all the issues. For purposes of the award of fees and costs, it is \u201cappropriate\u201d to make awards when the parties have [1] vindicated rights through consent judgment or [2] without formally obtaining relief, or [3] <em>where such award is in the public interest without regard to the outcome of the litigation.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b133-14\"><em>Id. </em>at 727-28 (emphasis added) (citations omitted). Although Senator Tunney occasionally referred to \u201cprevailing\u201d or \u201csuccessful\u201d plaintiffs, these references \u2014 when read in context \u2014 cannot be seen to be inconsistent with his initial view that the attorneys\u2019 fee provision should be \u201cliberally construed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 727. Nor do his remarks appear to be inconsistent with Senator Magnuson\u2019s view that the attorneys\u2019 fee provision \u201cis not restricted to . . . successful parties.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 729. This latter point is confirmed by Senator Tunney\u2019s observation that attorneys\u2019 fees may be \u201cappropriate\u201d \u201cwhere the award is in the public interest without regard to the outcome of the litigation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 728.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-15\">The remaining remarks offered by Senator Tunney pertained to the appropriate measure of attorneys\u2019 fees. On this final point, he commented as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>By specifying a general rule for the amount of fees to be awarded, this provision requires the method of calculating fees be no different than that now being utilized in other fields of law as, for example antitrust and securities regulation litigation. The \u201cactual time\u201d spent is that reasonably calculated to advance the client\u2019s interest. <em>The Stanford Daily v. Zurcher, </em>64 F.R.D. 680 (N.D.Cal.1974), and the amount can be adjusted for factors including inter alia, the centingent [sic] nature of the success or the quality of the work performed. <em>Lindy Bros. Builders v. American Radiator &amp; Standard Sanitary Corp., </em>487 F.2d 161 (3d Cir.1973), on remand, 382 F.Supp. 999 (E.D.Pa.1974), or benefits to the public from the suit. <em>Davis v. County of Los Angeles, </em>8 E.P.D. 9444 (C.D.Cal.1974). Fees should not be reduced merely because the attorneys are salaried employees of public interest and or foundations-funded law firms.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b134-4\">Legislative History at 728.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">With these general legislative standards in mind, we may now turn to the specific claims being advanced by EDF for attorneys\u2019 fees in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">III. THE EDF CLAIMS FOR ATTORNEYS\u2019 FEES</p>\n<p id=\"b134-7\">A. <em>Time Claimed For Work On The Case-In-Chief</em></p>\n<p id=\"b134-8\">The <em>EDF Motion </em>claims a total of 837.4 hours for the three attorneys who were assigned to and worked on the litigation in <em>EDF v. EPA, </em>broken down as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"APf9\">William Butler, Esq. \u2014 190.4 hours</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-9\">Jacqueline M. Warren \u2014 617.0 hours</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-10\">David J. Lennett \u2014 30.0 hours</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b134-11\"><em>See EDF Motion, EDF Supplementary Motion </em>and <em>EDF Reply. </em>In an \u201cAffidavit of Jacqueline M. Warren,\u201d accompanying the <em>EDF Motion, </em>it is indicated that Ms. Warren was a senior staff attorney at EDF, where she worked from June of 1973 until November of 1980. She graduated from Smith College in 1963 and from George Washington University National Law Center in 1972, where she ranked third in her class. At EDF, she was the principal staff attorney for the Toxic Chemicals Program, and participated in \u201cmany administrative and judicial proceedings concerning toxic chemicals.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1, 7-8.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-13\">William A. Butler was General Counsel of EDF when he participated in this case. He obtained a B.A. degree from Stanford University in 1963, a Master\u2019s degree from Oxford University in 1965, a J.D. degree from Yale University in 1969 and a Ph.D. from Harvard University in 1971. Mr. Butler was employed at EDF from 1970 until 1981 and, during that time, he \u201cinitiated, prepared and ultimately supervised the considerable amount of environmental litigation undertaken by EDF in federal district court and in courts of appeals.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-14\">David J. Lennett graduated from George Washington University National Law Center in 1979, and has been employed as a staff counsel at EDF ever since then. Prior to his graduation, Mr. Lennett worked part time at EDF and assisted with environmental litigation. Following graduation, he became the principal EDF attorney on hazardous waste matters. <em>Id. </em>at 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-15\">In the extensive descriptions of the work performed by these three EDF attorneys, their hours on <em>EDF v.

Marshall, </em>641 F.2d 880 (D.C.Cir.1980) (en banc).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Under <em>Copeland, </em>the attorneys\u2019 fee is computed by first determining the \u201clodestar,\u201d <em>i.e., </em>the number of hours reasonably expended multiplied by a reasonable hourly rate. The \u201clodestar\u201d fee may then be adjusted up or down to reflect the quality of representation and the contingent nature of success. <em>Id. </em>at 891-94.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-12\">As to the factor of \u201chours reasonably expended,\u201d <em>Copeland </em>states that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-13\">Compiling raw totals of hours spent . .. does not complete the inquiry. It does not follow that the amount of time <em>actually </em>expended is the amount of time <em>reasonably </em>expended .... Thus, no compensation is due for nonproductive time. For example, where three attorneys are present at a hearing when one would suffice, compensation should be denied for the excess time ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-14\">The reasonable hourly rate is that prevailing in the community for similar work .... [A] reasonable hourly rate is the product of a multiplicity of faetors[:] . . . the level of skill necessary, time limitations, the amount to be obtained in the litigation, the attorney\u2019s reputation, and the undesirability of the case. It follows that there may be more than one reasonable hourly rate for each of the attorneys, and for each of the kinds of work, involved in the litigation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b135-18\">641 F.2d at 891-92 (emphasis in original) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b135-19\">Concerning adjustments to the \u201clodestar\u201d attributable to \u201cthe contingent nature of success,\u201d 641 F.2d at 892, the decision in <em>Copeland </em>observes that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-20\">Under statutes like Title VII, only the prevailing party is eligible for a court-awarded fee. An attorney contemplating representation of a Title VII plaintiff must recognize that no fee will be forthcoming unless the litigation is successful. An adjustment in the lodestar, therefore, may be appropriate to compensate for the risk that the lawsuit would be unsuccessful and that no fee at all would be obtained.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-21\">It is important to recognize that the contingency adjustment is designed solely to compensate for the possibility at the outset that the litigation would be unsuccessful and that no fee would be obtained.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b135-22\">641 F.2d at 892-93. Since, as has already been indicated, attorneys\u2019 fees may be awarded to \u201cprevailing,\u201d \u201csubstantially prevailing\u201d or \u201cnon-prevailing\u201d parties under TSCA, this portion of the \u201ccontingent nature of success\u201d factor discussed in <em>Copeland </em>is irrelevant in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-23\">The court in <em>Copeland </em>also included a factor of \u201cdelay\u201d under the heading of \u201ccontingent nature of success.\u201d On this point, <em>Copeland </em>states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-24\">The delay in receipt of payment for services rendered is an additional factor that may be incorporated into a contingency adjustment. The hourly rates used <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>in the \u201clodestar\u201d represent the prevailing rate for clients who typically pay their bills promptly. Court-awarded fees normally are received long after the legal services are rendered. That delay can present cash-flow problems for the attorneys. In any event, payment today for services rendered long in the past deprives the eventual recipient of the value of the use of the money in the meantime, which use, particularly in an inflationary era, is valuable. A percentage adjustment to reflect the delay in receipt of payment therefore may be appropriate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A-C\"><em>Id. </em>at 893.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\">Finally, regarding adjustments to the \u201clodestar\u201d for \u201cquality of representation,\u201d <em>Copeland </em>holds that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-5\">A quality adjustment is appropriate only when the representation is unusually good or bad, <em>taking into account the level of skill normally expected </em>of an attorney commanding the hourly rate used to compute the \u201clodestar.\u201d In other words,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Amy\">the court must recognize that a consideration of \u201cquality\u201d inheres in the \u201clodestar\u201d award: counsel who possess or who are reputed to possess more experience, knowledge and legal talent generally command hour rates superior to those who are less endowed. Thus, the quality of an attorney\u2019s work <em>in general </em>is a component of the reasonable] hourly rate; this aspect of \u201cquality\u201d is reflected in the \u201clodestar\u201d and should not be utilized to augment or diminish the basic award under the rubric of \u201cthe quality of an attorney\u2019s work.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-6\"><em>Lindy I, </em>then permits an adjustment to the \u201clodestar\u201d \u2014 up or down \u2014 based on the all-around performance of counsel in the specific case: \u201cAny increase or decrease in fees to adjust for the quality of work is designed to take account of an unusual degree of skill, be it unusually poor or unusually good.\u201d 487 F.2d at 168... .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b136-7\"><em>Lindy II, </em>540 F.2d at 117-18 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-8\">Until now the calculations have entirely ignored the results of the litigation. Success was a threshold inquiry relevant to the entitlement <em>vel non </em>to a fee, but the amount or nature of recovery was not considered in setting the \u201clodestar.\u201d These latter factors should be considered now, under the rubric of \u201cquality of representation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-10\">Where exceptional results are obtained \u2014 taking into account the hourly rate commanded and number of hours expended \u2014 an increase in fee is justifiable.. ..</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-11\">Quality adjustments may be upward or downward. Thus, if a high-priced attorney performs in a competent but undistinguished manner, a decrease in the \u201clodestar\u201d may be necessary under the \u201cquality of representation\u201d rubric because the hourly rate used to calculate the \u201clodestar\u201d proved to be overly generous.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b136-12\">641 F.2d at 893-94.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-13\">In considering the relevance of <em>Copeland, </em>there is one point that must be emphasized. As noted above, <em>Copeland </em>involved a claim for fees under Title VII, a statute under which the <em>\u201cprevailing party\u201d </em>may seek \u201ca reasonable attorney\u2019s fee as a part of costs.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(k) (1976). TSCA, on the other hand, allows for \u201creasonable attorneys\u2019 fees\u201d \u201cif the court determines such an award is appropriate.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2618(d). The legislative history of this provision indicates that the attorneys\u2019 fee provision in TSCA \u201cis not restricted to ... successful parties,\u201d and that an award of attorneys\u2019 fees may be \u201cappropriate\u201d \u201cwhere such award is in the public interest without regard to the outcome of the litigation.\u201d Legislative History at 728-29. Thus, while \u201csuccess\u201d in litigation may be a factor in determining whether an adjustment to the \u201clodestar\u201d is due, it is not determinative of the question of whether any fee is due. Excluding this point, we believe that <em>Copeland </em>is a controlling precedent that must be followed in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-14\">C. <em>EPA\u2019s Opposition To The Claim For Attorneys' Fees</em></p>\n<p id=\"b136-15\">As noted at the outset of this opinion, EPA principally argues that EDF\u2019s claim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>should be strictly scrutinized, that the estimated \u201clodestar\u201d fee is exaggerated, and that no upward adjustment to the \u201clodestar\u201d is warranted. There is no serious claim that EDF is not entitled to some amount of attorneys\u2019 fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-4\">Specifically, EPA has raised the following issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-5\">(1) \u201c[A] substantial portion of Ms. Warren\u2019s hours must be deemed as \u201cunproductive\u201d time because it was devoted to pursuit of 2 of 4 claims upon which EDF did not prevail.\u201d <em>EPA Response </em>at 14.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-6\">(2) \u201cMs. Warren\u2019s and Mr. Butler\u2019s hours should be discounted because portions of both were devoted to EDF efforts relating to issues raised by the industry intervenors.\u201d <em>Id.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-7\">(3) EPA should not be \u201ctaxed with attorneys\u2019 fees relating to post-decision negotiations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 17.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-8\">(4) \u201cShould the Court disagree that Mr. Butler\u2019s hours for participating in settlement negotiations be entirely disallowed, it should still substantially reduce the total of these 176 hours as being unnecessary to a fair pursuit of the matter.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 18.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b137-9\">As an alternative proposal to EDF\u2019s claim on hours, EPA suggests that the following time should be <em>excluded </em>from the \u201clodestar:\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-10\">(1) 75% of 12 hours claimed by Ms. Warren for preparation of the motion to defer filing of appendix and to review motions to intervene.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-11\">(2) All 7 of the hours claimed by Ms. Warren for preparation of responses to Alcoa\u2019s Motion to Stay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-12\">(3) 25% of 330 hours for preparation of reply brief and oral argument.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-13\">(4) All 16 hours spent by Mr. Butler to monitor intervenors\u2019 petitions for rehearing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-14\">(5) 50% of Ms. Warren\u2019s remaining time because EDF prevailed on only two of four claims.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-15\">(6) At least 50% of the 176 hours claimed by Mr. Butler for post-decision settlement negotiations.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b137-16\">In sum, EPA argues that the number of \u201chours reasonably expended\u201d for each attorney should be adjusted as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aqq_\">Attorney EDF Claim EPA Proposal</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-17\">Mr. Butler 190.4 0-88</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-18\">Ms. Warren 617 260</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-19\">Mr. Lennett 30 30</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-20\">TOTAL ' 837.4 290-378</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b137-21\">In addition, EPA argues that \u201cEDF\u2019s suggested rates should be reduced to reflect the fact that much of the time consumed by its three counsel appears to have included neither \u2018in-court\u2019 time, nor other core litigation activity, such as brief writing.\u201d <em>EPA Response </em>at 20. EPA thus urges that the rates for EDF attorneys should be adjusted downwards as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-22\">Attorney EDF Claim EPA Proposal</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-23\">Mr. Butler $110.00 $82.50</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-24\">Ms. Warren 90.00 75.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-25\">Mr. Lennett 55.00 55.00</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b137-26\"><em>EPA Response </em>at 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-27\">Finally, EPA contends that there should be no upward adjustment in the \u201clodestar\u201d because (1) \u201cthe efforts of EDF\u2019s counsel were substantially within the range of skill normally expected of attorneys receiving the rates that they suggest,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 22; (2) \u201cthe burden faced by EDF... is the standard burden of any litigant in an administrative agency case,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 25; and (3) \u201cno contingency adjustment would be warranted here for delay in renumeration [because] EDF has only recently submitted its requests for fees\u201d and because \u201cthe hourly rates they suggest are derived from other recent decisions and, therefore, reflect current market values.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-28\">IV.

The court added that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-7\">It is not necessary to know the exact number of minutes spent nor the precise activity to which each hour was devoted nor the specific attainments of each attorney. But without some fairly definite information as to the hours devoted to various general activities, <em>e.g., </em>pretrial discovery, settlement negotiations, and the hours spent by various classes of attorneys, <em>e.g., </em>senior partners, junior partners, associates, the court cannot know the nature of the services for which compensation is sought.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b138-8\"><em>Copeland, </em>641 F.2d at 891 (quoting from <em>Lindy Bros. Builders, Inc. v. American Radiator &amp; Standard Sanitary Corp., </em>487 F.2d 161, 167 (3d Cir. 1973)).</p>\n<p id=\"b138-9\">The documentation furnished by EDF in this case is <em>more </em>than enough to satisfy the test set forth in <em>Copeland. </em>Here, petitioner has submitted</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-10\">(1) daily time sheets for attorneys Warren and Butler;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-11\">(2) written declarations from attorneys Warren, Butler and Lennett describing in detail the precise nature of the work performed by them, the hours attributed to each category of work, the approximate numbers of hours discounted as potentially \u201cduplicate\u201d or \u201cnonproductive\u201d and the approximate dates when each category of work was performed;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-13\">. (3) an affidavit from Jacqueline Warren describing the history of the litigation, the litigation goals and strategies of EDF, and the qualifications of each of the participating attorneys; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-14\">(4) citations to authorities to justify the reasonableness of the hourly rates claimed for each attorney.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b138-15\"><em>See EDF Motion </em>(including \u201cMemorandum of Points\u201d and \u201cAffidavit of Jacqueline M. Warren\u201d), <em>EDF Supplementary Motion </em>(including \u201cSupplementary Declarations\u201d), and <em>EDF Reply. </em>We have considered this information with care and we find it sufficient to allow us to judge the reasonableness of the hours expended. Indeed, we believe that petitioners in this case have furnished more detailed information than was required by this court in <em>Copeland. (See </em>discussion at 641 F.2d 902 for a review of the documentation considered in <em>Copeland.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b138-16\">We agree with EPA that, as an appellate court (without the benefit of pre-trial motions, discovery supervision, and extended courtroom hearings comparable to what a district judge might experience), we should scrutinize an attorneys\u2019 fee claim with particular care. We also note, however, as did the court in <em>Copeland, </em>that \u201c[ojther circuit courts of appeals have observed that appellate judges are themselves experts in assessing the reasonableness of an attorney\u2019s fee award, and that the appellate court . . . may independently review the record, or itself set the fee.\u201d 641 F.2d at 902 (footnotes omitted). Since, under TSCA, we are obliged to \u201cindependently review the record\u201d and \u201cset the fee,\u201d we have undertaken this responsibility and pursued the task with care. We have no doubt that, had it been necessary, we could have requested further documentation from the parties or scheduled hearings before designated members of the panel. In this case, however, since the documentation furnished by EDF is more than adequate, we are confident that we have enough information to complete the task before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>B. <em>Hours Reasonably Expended</em></p>\n<p id=\"b139-4\">1. <em>EPA\u2019s Request To Reduce Hours In Connection With Work Performed On Issues Upon Which EDF Did Not Prevail</em></p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">EPA asserts that, under <em>Copeland, </em>EDF should not receive attorneys\u2019 fees for time spent litigating claims upon which petitioners did not prevail. For the reasons already given at the conclusion of section III-B <em>supra, </em>we reject this contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">First, to reiterate, attorneys\u2019 fees under TSCA are not restricted to \u201csuccessful parties.\u201d Legislative History at 729. Furthermore, because we find that the litigation in <em>EDF v. EPA </em>involved critically important and difficult issues of first impression, and that the outcome of the litigation greatly served the public interest, we hold that there should be no discount in the fees awarded simply because EDF failed to prevail on one of three closely-related issues. At the conclusion of a 41-page slip opinion in <em>EDF v. EPA, </em>the court highlighted the significance of the litigation with the following observation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-7\">We feel constrained to add one final note to emphasize our concern in this case. Human beings have finally come to recognize that they must eliminate or control life threatening chemicals, such as PCBs, if the miracle of life is to continue and if earth is to remain a living planet. This is precisely what Congress sought to do when it enacted section 6(e) of the Toxic Substances Control Act. Yet, we find that forty-six months after the effective date of an act designed to either totally ban or closely control the use of PCBs, 99% of the PCBs that were in use when the Act was passed are still in use in the United States. With information such as this in hand, timid souls have good reason to question the prospects for our continued survival, and cynics have just cause to sneer at the effectiveness of governmental regulation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-9\">The EPA regulations can hardly be viewed as a bold step forward in the battle against life threatening chemicals. There is no substantial evidence in the record to support certain of the EPA regulatory enactments, and portions of the regulations are plainly contrary to law. Thus, the effort by EPA has, in certain respects, fallen far short of the mark set by the congressional mandate found in section 6(e) of the Toxic Substances Control Act.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b139-10\">636 F.2d at 1286-87 (footnote omitted). We think that there can be no doubt regarding the point that the public interest was well served by EDF\u2019s litigation in <em>EDF v. EPA.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b139-11\">Even with respect to the \u201cuse authorization\u201d issue alone, <em>see </em>636 F.2d at 1275, upon which EDF did not prevail in <em>EDF v. EPA, </em>we find that the efforts of EDF nevertheless benefitted the public interest. The questions pertaining to the \u201cuse authorization\u201d regulations were highly detailed, difficult, important and hardly frivolous. The resolution of these questions was important in determining under what circumstances and to what extent TSCA permits EPA to authorize by rule non-totally enclosed uses of PCBs.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-12\">In light of all of these considerations and in light of the fact that the \u201cuse authorization\u201d issue was intimately related to other issues in the case, we reject EPA\u2019s request for a reduction in hours because of EDF\u2019s failure to prevail on one issue.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b139-13\">2. <em>EPA\u2019s Request To Reduce Hours In Connection With Work Performed On Issues Raised By Industry Intervenors</em></p>\n<p id=\"b139-14\">EPA contends that the hours logged by both Ms. Warren and Mr. Butler in litigating against intervenors should not be charged to EPA. Apart from the 16 hours claimed for Mr. Butler for \u201cmonitoring of post-decision petitions for rehearing,\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> we reject EPA\u2019s position.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>As has been accurately noted in the <em>EDF Reply, </em>\u201c[h]ere, even where intervenors or the amicus curiae raised points not specifically made by EPA, EDF\u2019s responses were largely made in terms directly applicable to EPA and its arguments.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 23. In addition, it was critical for EDF to respond to and prevail on the jurisdictional challenge raised by the Electronic Industries Association in order to reach the merits of the issues raised in <em>EDF v. EPA.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b140-4\">EPA argues that the \u201cagency is not in privity with the intervenors, did not control or direct their presentations to the Court, and EDF did not oppose these interventions.\u201d <em>EPA Response </em>at 15. What is more important, however, is that' all of the positions advanced by the intervenors were in defense of the disputed EPA regulations. Furthermore, there is no suggestion that EDF counsel did any duplicate work in responding to the arguments raised by intervenors as opposed to those raised by EPA. Finally, and most significantly, EPA never opposed any of the positions asserted by the intervenors.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In view of these considerations, we can find no merit in EPA\u2019s position.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">3. <em>EPA\u2019s Request To Reduce Hours In Connection With Work Performed During Post-Decision Negotiations</em></p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">EPA contends that the agency should not be \u201ctaxed with attorneys\u2019 fees relating to post-decision negotiations.\u201d <em>EPA Response </em>at 17. When considered in the context of the specific litigation here in question, this claim by the agency borders on being frivolous. Accordingly, we reject it.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-10\">We need look no further than the <em>EPA Response </em>for an accurate description of the post-decision events that are critical to our inquiry on this point:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-11\">The result of the Court\u2019s decision [in <em>EDF v. EPA </em>] placed the industry users of PCBs in a difficult posture. Section 6(e), TSCA, contains broad prohibitions on the manufacture, processing, distribution, and use of PCBs. Portions of EPA\u2019s PCB Ban Rules which this Court invalidated would have had the effect of softening the impact of the prohibitions of Section 6(e). If the Court\u2019s mandate had issued as scheduled on December 22,1980, the strict prohibitions of Section 6(e) would have taken effect immediately. These prohibitions would have had far-reaching impact. The full impact of these prohibitions was not known, but EPA and EDF believed that, if the Court\u2019s mandate had issued, any person using a transformer or capacitor containing any concentration of PCBs would have been in violation of Section 6(e) unless the person discontinued these operations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-12\">Issuance of the Court\u2019s mandate would have had a serious impact on activities which create PCBs as well as on the use of PCBs. PCBs in concentrations below 50 ppm are generated in numerous manufacturing processes. Issuance of the Court\u2019s mandate would have disrupted these manufacturing activities. Moreover, statutory prohibitions extend beyond the manufacture of PCBs to the processing, distribution in commerce, and use of products containing any concentration of PCBs. Issuance of the Court\u2019s mandate would have had substantial immediate impact upon persons engaged in these activities.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-13\">In addition to the problems posed to users of PCBs from immediate issuance of the mandate, the Court\u2019s decision instructed EPA to build a sufficiently reliable factual record before promulgating new regulations covering the totally enclosed uses of PCBs or dealing with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>complex problem of PCBs in low concentrations. Each of the parties to the prior litigation recognized that developing new rules would require the generation of a great amount of new factual material.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-4\">To assure that the development of new PCB rules did not cause needless disruption of major segments of the economy while, at the same time, reducing the risks of PCB exposure, EPA, EDF, and the industry intervenors, and other persons affected by the Court\u2019s decision held an extended series of meetings between November, 1980 and February, 1981.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-5\">These meetings resulted, <em>inter alia, </em>in the filing of three joint motions to the Court. These motions requested the court to stay issuance of its mandate, while EPA conducted new rulemaking with respect to PCBs and while industry groups undertook activities related to the new rulemaking.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-6\">On February 12, 1981, the Court entered an order in response to a joint motion of January 21, 1981. The February 12 order adopted a plan for EPA to conduct new rulemaking on uses of PCBs that EPA\u2019s previous rules had characterized as \u201ctotally enclosed,\u201d and required that persons continuing to use electrical equipment must adhere to the terms of a temporary risk-reduction regime called the \u201cInterim Measures Program.\u201d The February 12 order also required the EEI to conduct a study relating to the use of PCBs in electrical equipment and to submit the study to EPA for the record of the Agency\u2019s new rules that would address the use of PCBs in such equipment. This order also required EPA to announce a proposed rule on this issue no later than 60 days after submission of the EEI study to EPA and to promulgate a final rule within 60 days after the expiration of a sixty-day comment period on the proposal. The study is to be submitted to EPA by January, 1982.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-8\">On April 13,1981, the Court entered an order in response to a joint motion that was submitted on February 20, 1981. The April 13 order adopted a plan for further action by EPA and industry groups leading towards new rulemaking on the regulations of PCBs in concentrations below 50 ppm. The April 13 order required EPA: (1) to publish two ANPR\u2019s in the <em>Federal Register; </em>(2) within 18 months from the date of the order, to promulgate a final rule allowing for the generation of PCBs in \u201cclosed manufacturing processes\u201d or only as constituents of \u201ccontrolled wastes,\u201d or to explain the reasons for not proceeding with such a rule; and (3) within eleven months after the date of the order, to advise the Court of EPA\u2019s plans and schedule for further action on PCBs in concentrations below 50 ppm generated other than in \u201cclosed manufacturing processes\u201d or as constituents of \u201ccontrolled wastes.\u201d EPA published the ANPR\u2019s required by the April 13 order on May 20, 1981. (46 Fed.Reg. 27614).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b141-9\"><em>EPA Response </em>at 3-6.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-10\">As may be seen from EPA\u2019s own description, following the court\u2019s decision in <em>EDF v. EPA, </em>(1) the parties (including both EDF and EPA) participated in extensive deliberations and negotiations in order to seek a stay of the mandate and develop a program to achieve a revised regulatory scheme; (2) a stay of the mandate was issued, and court jurisdiction retained, pursuant to <em>joint </em>motions submitted by the parties; (3) the post-decision events were intimately related to the litigation in the case-in-chief; and (4) the continued participation of EDF in the post-decision deliberations was essential to a successful resolution of this litigation.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> With these facts in mind, we cannot take seriously EPA\u2019s assertion that EDF is barred from claiming attorneys\u2019 fees for post-decision negotiations work.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b142-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>C. <em>The Reasonable Hourly Rates</em></p>\n<p id=\"b142-4\">As noted above, EDF has requested rates of $110/hour, $90/hour and $55/hour for Mr. Butler, Ms. Warren and Mr. Lennett, respectively. EPA has countered with rate proposals of $82.50/hour, $75/hour and $55/hour. EPA does not seriously contest the accuracy of rates cited by EDF insofar as \u201cmarket value\u201d is concerned.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Rather, EPA principally contends that the court should distinguish between \u201cin-court,\u201d \u201cout-of-court,\u201d and \u201ctravel\u201d time, and that the rates claimed for Mr. Butler and Ms. Warren should be reduced because most of their work in this case involved non-court time.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">Whatever there is to be said about \u201ctravel time\u201d can await another day; it is conceded that \u201ctravel time\u201d is not a significant factor in this case. As for the distinction sought between \u201cin-court\u201d and \u201cout-of-court\u201d time, the simple answer is that <em>Copeland </em>does not compel any such rate differentiations. Rather, in determining \u201cmarket value,\u201d the decision in <em>Copeland </em>focuses on (1) level of skill necessary, (2) time limitations, (8) the amount to be obtained in the litigation, (4) the attorney\u2019s reputation, and (5) the undesirability of the case. 641 F.2d at 892. <em>Copeland </em>does indicate that \u201cthere may be more than one reasonable hourly rate for each of the attorneys, and for each of <em>the kinds of work, </em>involved in the litigation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). The emphasis, however, is on a general reference to \u201ckinds of work,\u201d not \u201cin-court\u201d versus \u201cout-of-court\u201d work.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-7\">In this case, given the importance of the post-decision negotiations, the high level of skill required (to maintain a litigation victory and yet accommodate to the legitimate needs and interests of numerous intervenors and a federal agency), the significant public interest value of the litigation, and the going \u201cmarket value\u201d for the services of a lawyer with like experience and skills, we find that the $110/hour rate claimed for Mr. Butler is perfectly reasonable. Taking into account like considerations, we also find that the rate of $90/hour claimed for Ms. Warren is quite reasonable. EPA does not contend that any of Ms. Warren\u2019s time was frivolous, insignificant or unrelated to the litigation. Indeed, it appears that she was principally responsible for marshalling and implementing the entire EDF litigation strategy.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Thus, it seems to us that EPA\u2019s focus on non-court time misses the mark. Ms. Warren did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>most of the very substantial work on the EDF briefs and this work certainly was no less significant to the success of the litigation than was her oral presentation to the court. Since the rate claimed for Ms. Warren appears to be well within the range of the \u201cmarket value\u201d for a person of her experience performing the type of work at issue here, we shall grant the request for 617 hours at $90/hour.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b143-4\">We should add that, with respect to the rates claimed for all three EDF attorneys, we are also influenced by the factors cited in the legislative history of section 19(d) of TSCA. <em>See </em>Legislative History at 728. We note in particular that EDF did not \u201cstand to gain significant economic benefits through participation in the proceeding.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 729. As a public interest group, relying heavily on private donations and attorneys\u2019 fees in cases such as this one, EDF cannot be considered to be an association \u201cthat could otherwise afford to participate,\u201d in the sense that that condition is intended in the legislative history. <em>Id. </em>at 730.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">We also note that the legislative history cites <em>Lindy Bros. Builders, Inc. v. American Radiator &amp; Standard Sanitary Corp., </em>487 F.2d 161 (3d Cir. 1973), <em>on remand, </em>382 F.Supp. 999, <em>aff\u2019d in part and vacated in part, </em>540 F.2d 102 (3d Cir. 1976), Legislative History at 728, a case heavily relied upon by this court in <em>Copeland. See, e.g., </em>641 F.2d at 890-94, 902-03. The citation to <em>Lindy </em>is significant because the Third Circuit, just as did this court in <em>Copeland, </em>endorsed a \u201cmarket value\u201d approach in fee-setting. 487 F.2d at 167.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">Finally, the legislative history makes it clear that \u201c[f]ees should not be reduced merely because the attorneys are salaried employees of public interest and or foundations-funded law firms.\u201d Legislative History at 728. This factor is, of course, relevant here in the light of EDF\u2019s institutional status as a public interest organization.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-10\">As a final point of emphasis, we reiterate that EPA has made only a feeble challenge to the specific hourly rates claimed by EDF. <em>See </em>note 11 <em>supra. </em>There is no contention that EDF has failed to follow the \u201cmarket-value\u201d approach adopted in <em>Copeland. </em>EPA has disputed the rates cited by EDF, but we have found this challenge to be wanting. <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>15</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b143-11\">D. <em>Calculation Of The \u201cLodestar\u201d Fee</em></p>\n<p id=\"b143-12\">In the light of our holdings above, the \u201clodestar\u201d fee in this case is calculated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-13\">Attorney Hours Rate/Hour Total</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-14\">William A. Butler 178.4 $110 $19,624.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-15\">Jacqueline M. Warren 617 $ 90 $55,530.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-16\">David J.

We agree that there should be a modest adjustment, in the neighborhood of 15-20%, to reflect \u201cbenefits to the public from suit,\u201d Legislative History at 728, and \u201cthe delay in receipt of payment for services rendered.\u201d <em>Copeland, </em>641 F.2d at 893. However, we believe that any greater adjustment would be excessive given the circumstances of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>EDP cites <em>Keith v. Volpe, </em>86 F.R.D. 565 (C.D.Cal.1980), in support of its request for a doubling of the \u201clodestar.\u201d <em>Keith, </em>like this case, was a case of first impression, involving an. interpretation of the California Environmental Quality Act of 1970. There, the plaintiffs successfully sought an order enjoining the construction of a massive freeway project principally because of its environmental impact. In applying a 3.5 multiplier of the \u201clodestar,\u201d the court in <em>Keith </em>noted that plaintiffs\u2019 counsel \u201cprovided first-rate legal services in successfully advocating the protection of the environmental and human interests at stake.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 574. We find <em>Keith </em>instructive but not determinative. Here, we are bound to follow <em>Copeland </em>and the guidelines set forth in the legislative history surrounding section 19(d) of TSCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-4\">The two factors that we rely on to increase the \u201clodestar\u201d from $76,804 to $90,-000, <em>i.e., </em>approximately 17%, are public benefit and delay in receipt of payments. As we have already noted several times, it is clear that EDF\u2019s pursuit of this litigation greatly benefitted the public interest. TSCA was designed by Congress to \u201celiminate or control life threatening chemicals, such as PCBs,\u201d and the action by EDF helped to demonstrate that the regulatory \u201ceffort by EPA [had], in certain respects, fallen far short of the mark set by the congressional mandate found in section 6(e) of the Toxic Substances Control Act.\u201d <em>EDF v. EPA, </em>636 F.2d at 1286-1287. The benefit to the public is obvious and EDF is entitled to an upward adjustment in the \u201clodestar\u201d for their litigation efforts.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">Likewise, an upward adjustment, albeit modest, is also due for the delay in the receipt of attorneys\u2019 fees. As this court noted in Copeland:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-6\">The hourly rates used in the \u201clodestar\u201d represent the prevailing rate for clients who typically pay their bills promptly. Court-awarded fees normally are received long after legal services are rendered. That delay can present cash-flow problems for the attorneys. In any event, payment today for services rendered long in the past deprives the eventual recipient of the value of the use of the money in the meantime, which use, particularly in an inflationary era, is valuable. A percentage adjustment to reflect the delay in receipt of payment therefore may be appropriate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b144-8\">641 F.2d at 893. While we believe that some increase is due for delay, we have limited the amount because of three factors. First, the hourly rates claimed by EDF are current market rates, not those in effect when the case was litigated. Second, EDF did not file its claim for attorneys\u2019 fees until August 1981 and a portion of the documentation was not presented until October 1981 (in the <em>EDF Supplementary Motion </em>and the <em>EDF Reply). </em>Finally, the actual period of delay, from the time when all documentation was submitted until EDF is actually paid, should be no more than six months.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-9\">As for EDF\u2019s additional claims in support of a greater increase in the \u201clodestar fee,\u201d we must reject them for several reasons. Apart from the delay factor, nothing more is due for \u201cthe contingent nature of success\u201d because EDF did not have to \u201cprevail\u201d in order to obtain attorneys\u2019 fees under TSCA. This clearly distinguishes this case from the situation posed in <em>Copeland. See </em>641 F.2d at 892-93. \u201cThe contingency adjustment is a percentage increase in the \u2018lodestar\u2019 to reflect the risk that <em>no fee </em>will be obtained.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 893 (emphasis added). In this case, we believe that there was little or no risk that \u201cno fee\u201d would be obtained.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-10\">As to \u201cquality of representation,\u201d we agree with the position of EPA that \u201cEDF\u2019s counsel performed at [levels] of proficiency that [were] within the usual range of these experienced lawyers\u2019 skills.\u201d <em>EPA Response </em>at 24. We also agree that the legal burden faced by EDF in this litigation was \u201cthe standard burden of any litigant in an administrative agency case.\u201d Id. at 25. It is true that the case was extremely important and very complicated, and that EDF counsel performed with great skill; however, these factors are fully compensated by the amounts credited under the categories <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>of \u201chours reasonably expended\u201d and \u201creasonable hourly rates.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b145-4\">Finally, we must also consider the \u201cresults of the litigation.\u201d <em>Copeland, </em>641 F.2d at 894. Although petitioners need not \u201cprevail\u201d in order to claim attorneys\u2019 fees under TSCA, we believe that \u201cnon-prevailing\u201d is a factor that should militate against upward adjustments in the \u201clodestar.\u201d Here, EDF lost on one of three issues decided by the court in <em>EDF v. EPA. </em>The issue was hardly insignificant and, therefore, it cannot be ignored in our calculations.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">In sum, we find that EDF should receive an upward adjustment of 15-20% in the \u201clodestar\u201d fee, in recognition of the critically important public benefits of the litigation and to compensate for delay in payment. However, for the reasons cited, we must reject the request by EDF for an increase in the \u201clodestar\u201d by a factor of two.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">V. THE AWARD OF ATTORNEYS\u2019 FEES ON THE CASE-IN-CHIEF</p>\n<p id=\"b145-7\">In the light of our holdings above, the award of attorneys\u2019 fees to EDF for work on the case-in-chief shall be as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-8\">Attorney Hours Rate/Hour Total</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-9\">William A. Butler 178.4 $110 $19,624.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-10\">Jacqueline M. Warren 617 $ 90 $55,530.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-11\">David J.

TIMELINESS OF EDF\u2019S REQUEST FOR ATTORNEYS\u2019 FEES</p>\n<p id=\"Agx\">Intervenor AC Paper &amp; Film Capacitor has filed a special opposition to EDF\u2019s motion for attorneys\u2019 fees, contending that fees should be denied because EDF\u2019s request \u201cis over nine months out of time.\u201d, <em>AC Paper Opposition </em>at 4. In particular, AC Paper cites Rule 39(c) of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure. Finding no merit in this claim, we reject it.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-17\">Initially, we would indicate that we doubt that AC Paper has any standing to raise a timeliness claim on fees that will be assessed solely against EPA. We need not decide this issue, however, because the claim is patently without merit. Rule 39(c) covers only \u201ccosts,\u201d not attorneys\u2019 fees. We are unwilling, automatically to apply the 14-day limitations period from Rule 39 in connection with a statutory fee provision. There is no specific limitations period for the submission of attorneys\u2019 fees claims under section 19(d) of TSCA. The statute simply provides that fees may be awarded \u201cif the court determines that such an award is appropriate.\u201d This standard gives a court discretion to consider the reasonableness of attorneys\u2019 fees claims and, if \u201cappropriate\u201d (considering traditional equitable principles), to reject claims as untimely filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-19\">EPA has not contended that it was unreasonable for EDF to file for attorneys\u2019 fees when they did. Furthermore, given the extensive and complicated history of the litigation in this case (including elaborate post-decision proceedings), we do not believe that any such claim would be justified. All things considered, the timeliness claim of AC Paper must be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-20\">VII. THE ATTORNEYS\u2019 FEE CLAIM PERTAINING TO THE SUPPLEMENTAL FEE APPLICATION OF EDF FOR THE SERVICES OF TRILLING &amp; KENNEDY</p>\n<p id=\"b145-21\">The final issue to be decided here involves the supplemental attorneys\u2019 fees application of EDF for legal services performed by Trilling &amp; Kennedy. <em>See EDF Reply </em>at 46-48, and <em>EDF Supplementary Motion.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b145-22\">On October 5, 1981, EDF and Trilling &amp; Kennedy executed a retainer agreement, whereby Trilling &amp; Kennedy agreed \u201cto perform all required legal services in connection with an application for attorneys\u2019 fees with respect to\u201d the <em>EDF v. EPA </em>litigation. <em>See </em>\u201cSupplementary Declarations\u201d in the <em>EDF Supplementary Motion. </em>The agreement also stated that \u201cthe parties ... consider $110 per hour to be a reasonable hourly rate for the services of Trilling &amp; Kennedy.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b145-23\">Pursuant to this agreement, Trilling &amp; Kennedy prepared and submitted the <em>EDF Reply, </em>a \u201cMotion For Leave to File Motion for Attorneys' Fees Out of Time,\u201d and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number><em>EDF Supplementary Motion </em>(with attachments). For this work, EDF has claimed 11.2 hours for Mr. Kennedy<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> and 73.60 hours for Mr. Trilling,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> for a total of 84.8 hours. The hourly rate requested is $110/hour, with a \u201clodestar\u201d amplification of 50%. <em>EDF Reply </em>at 48-49. Thus, the \u201clodestar\u201d fee for Trilling &amp; Kennedy is $9,328.00, and the total fee requested (with the 50% amplification) is $13,992.00.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b146-4\">A. <em>EDF Entitlement To An Award Of Attorneys\u2019 Fees For Time Spent In Preparing The Application For Fees</em></p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">EDF, relying on <em>Chrapliwy v. Uniroyal, Inc., </em>509 F.Supp. 442 (N.D.Ind.1981), and other like decisions, submits that \u201cit is well established that time reasonably devoted to obtaining attorneys\u2019 fees in the context of litigation where the court must be petitioned for such an award is itself subject to the award of attorneys\u2019 fees.\u201d <em>EDF Reply </em>at 46. In <em>Chrapliwy, </em>the court noted that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-6\">Petitioners request compensation for 581 hours devoted to preparing this fee application and supporting documentation. ... Payment for time spent preparing an attorney\u2019s fee application was recently approved by the Seventh Circuit in <em>Bond v. Stanton, </em>630 F.2d 1231 (7th Cir. 1980). Although that decision was based upon the Civil Rights Attorney\u2019s Fee Award Act of 1976, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988, its reasoning is dispositive of the issue here.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b146-10\">509 F.Supp. at 454. The EPA neither disputes the general principle stated by EDF nor the relevance of <em>Chrapliwy </em>and like decisions. Within bounds, we accept the basic contention of EDF, <em>i.e., </em>that time reasonably devoted to obtaining attorneys\u2019 fees in the context of litigation <em>where the court must be petitioned for such an award </em>is itself subject to an award of fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-11\">For us, the critical fact here is that EDF was required to seek a court award of attorneys\u2019 fees under TSCA. The attorneys\u2019 fee question has, as a consequence, become one of the issues of the case. EDF, therefore, should be entitled to receive just attorneys\u2019 fees for time reasonably expended to resolve the matter in dispute if the court otherwise determines such fees to be appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-12\">If EPA had been willing to pay attorneys\u2019 fees on EDF\u2019s original submission in August of 1981, <em>see EDF Motion </em>(including \u201cMemorandum of Points and Authorities\u201d), then EDF would have been limited to a claim of 30 hours for the time spent by Mr. Lennett in \u201cpreparation of materials to request attorneys\u2019 fees.\u201d <em>Id. </em>However, once EPA challenged the submission, making it an issue for disposition by the court, EDF was entitled to seek an award for fees for the additional time reasonably expended in defending the original request for fees. For us to rule otherwise would be to unfairly penalize EDF and to ignore the clear congressional mandate found in section 19(d) of TSCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>B. <em>Documentation</em></p>\n<p id=\"b147-4\">The documentation submitted by Trilling &amp; Kennedy of hours reasonably expended is both clear and thorough. The documentation also makes plain the fact that potentially duplicate and/or nonproductive hours have been excluded. Since we find that the documentation for the supplemental claim is as detailed and complete as the documentation for the case-in-chief, we have no difficulty in accepting it as submitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">C. <em>Hours Reasonably Expended</em></p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">EPA argues that EDF \u201coverestimated the number of Trilling &amp; Kennedy\u2019s hours that were \u2018reasonably expended\u2019 \u201d on the work in question. <em>EPA Response to Supplementary Motion </em>at 5. In particular, EPA first contends that \u201cEDF did not prevail on some aspects of the merits in this case, so any calculation of \u2018reasonable hours\u2019 for a fee award should be reduced according to the relative proportions of merits issues on which EDF won and lost.\u201d <em>Id. </em>For the reasons already given in section IV-B(l), <em>supra, </em>we reject this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-7\">EPA next argues that the \u201chours should be further reduced, to the extent that the supplemental claim represents EDF efforts in litigating against intervenor EIA, rather than EPA, on fee award issues.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 6. Insofar as this argument reasserts questions already disposed of in section IV-B(2), we reject it. However, insofar as the EPA position focuses on a claim that \u201ccompensation is being sought for about 10 hours of Trilling &amp; Kennedy\u2019s time that was devoted solely to responding to EIA\u2019s argument that EDF\u2019s original fee award motion is untimely,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 7, we find it to be meritorious. On this latter point, we hold that the hours submitted by EDF for work performed by Trilling &amp; Kennedy should be reduced by 9.75 hours to exclude the time spent on the timeliness issue. As we have already noted, the timeliness issue was patently meritless and thus warranted little if anything by way of response. More importantly, however, we note that counsel for EPA authorized counsel for EDF to represent that EPA did not object to the granting of the \u201cMotion for Leave to File Out of Time.\u201d <em>See </em>note 2 <em>supra. </em>Therefore, unlike the other issues discussed in section IV-B(2), <em>supra, </em>the positions of EPA and the intervenor were not aligned on the issue of timeliness. For these reasons, we believe that the agency should not be charged for legal work done on behalf of EDF on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-10\">D. <em>Reasonable Hourly Rates</em></p>\n<p id=\"b147-11\">EPA asserts that the $110/hour rate claimed for the work done by Trilling &amp; Kennedy is excessive. <em>EPA Response to Supplementary Motion </em>at 8. This argument is advanced despite the fact that EPA concedes that \u201cTrilling &amp; Kennedy are attorneys with levels of experience and competence equivalent to Mr. Butler and Ms. Warren of EDF.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-12\">Since the arguments made by EPA to support this position are nearly identical to the ones raised in connection with the claim for attorneys\u2019 fees in the case-in-chief, we need not repeat our rulings on the agency\u2019s contentions. Suffice it to say that the EPA position finds no substantial support in the record and must, therefore, be rejected for the reasons already given in section IV-C <em>supra. See </em>also note 11 <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b147-13\">E. <em>Adjustments To The \u201cLodestar\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b147-14\">EDF has requested an upward adjustment to the \u201clodestar\u201d of 50% for the hours expended by Trilling &amp; Kennedy. Except for a 5% adjustment for a factor of \u201cdelay,\u201d we deny this request largely for the reasons given in section IV-E <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b147-15\">As to the \u201ccontingent nature of success\u201d factor, EDF argues that the contingency fee arrangement between EDF and Trilling &amp; Kennedy \u201cis manifestly the situation envisioned as appropriate for upward adjustment\u201d under <em>Copeland. EDF Reply on Supplementary Motion </em>at 6. We think not. The \u201ccontingency\u201d in question is not whether Trilling &amp; Kennedy will recover under their agreement with EDF, but whether EDF will recover fees under section 19(d) of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>TSCA. As we have already said, \u201cin this case, we believe that there was little or no risk that \u2018no fee\u2019 would be obtained.\u201d <em>See </em>section IV-E.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\">Furthermore, while the \u201cquality of representation\u201d furnished by Trilling &amp; Kennedy was first-rate, the work done clearly was performed at levels of proficiency that were within the usual range of these experienced lawyers\u2019 skills. As a consequence, the hours expended by Trilling &amp; Kennedy will be fully compensated by the amounts credited under the categories of \u201chours reasonably expended\u201d and \u201creasonable hourly rates.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">Lastly, we find no adjustment due for \u201cbenefits to the public.\u201d <em>See </em>Legislative History at 728. The work done by Trilling &amp; Kennedy was helpful to the court in considering and deciding issues of first impression regarding the proper construction of section 19(d) of TSCA. Nevertheless, substantial guidance was available because of the existence of the legislative history and controlling precedents such as <em>Cope-la nd. </em>We cannot, therefore, equate this work with the legal work done on the casein-chief.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">VIII. THE AWARD OF ATTORNEYS\u2019 FEES FOR THE WORK DONE BY TRILLING &amp; KENNEDY</p>\n<p id=\"AW6\">In light of our holdings above, an award of attorneys\u2019 fees to EDF for the work done by Trilling &amp; Kennedy shall be made in the following amount:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-7\">Attorney Hours Rate/Hour Total</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-8\">B. Kennedy 1.45 $110 $ 159.50</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-9\">B.

CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b148-13\">For all of the reasons heretofore set forth in this opinion, we hereby rule that EDF shall be paid by EPA, as expeditiously as is reasonably possible, an award of attorneys\u2019 fees totalling $99,534.50.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-16\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b131-13\">. In this Motion, EDF avers that \u201cCounsel for EPA has authorized the undersigned to represent that EPA does not object to the granting of this Motion for Leave to File Out of Time.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b131-23\">. Although EPA does argue that \u201cEDF\u2019s claim should be rejected for lack of adequate documentation,\u201d EPA <em>Response </em>at 10, there is no real claim that EDF is not entitled to some amount of attorneys\u2019 fees.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b132-8\">. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412(d)(2)(A)(ii) adds that, in specified circumstances:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-9\">(.... [Attorney fees shall not be awarded in excess of $75 per hour unless the court determines that an increase in the cost of living or a special factor, such as the limited availability of qualified attorneys for the proceedings involved, justifies a higher fee.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b132-10\">However, it appears clear that the \u201c$75 per hour\u201d limit in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412 is not applicable to fees awarded under TSCA. By its terms, section (d)(2) is limited to awards to parties who meet specified income or net worth criteria. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412(d)(2)(B). For this special class of prevailing parties, Congress determined that an award <em>\u201cshall\" </em>be made <em>\u201cunless </em>the court finds that the position of the United States was substantially justified or that special circumstances make an award unjust,\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412(d)(2)(A) (emphasis added), although at the limited rates outlined in section (d)(2)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b132-14\">More generally, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412(b) states, in part, that \u201cthe United States shall be liable for such fees and expenses to the same extent that any other party would be liable under the common law or <em>under the terms of any statute which specifically provides for such an award.\" </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b132-15\">In this case, EPA does not contend that EDF's attorneys\u2019 fee claim may be limited by reference to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412(d)(2)(A)(ii). Indeed, at several places in the <em>EPA Response, </em>EPA acknowledges that EDF attorneys may be entitled to a rate above $75 per hour. <em>Id. </em>at 20-21.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b133-11\">. Senator Magnuson added that the attorneys\u2019 fee provision \u201cis ... intended to discourage individuals who may stand to benefit economically from the proceeding from joining with other individuals for the purpose of forming an organization to obtain compensation for participation in an agency proceeding under this Act.\u201d Legislative History at 729. He further stated that attorneys\u2019 fees would not be appropriate for \u201cpersons, including corporations or trade associations, that could otherwise afford to participate or whose economic interest in the outcome of a proceeding is not insubstantial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 730.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b135-15\">. <em>Copeland </em>involved the standards to be applied in awarding attorneys\u2019 fees against the government under section 706(k) of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(k) (1976).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b139-8\">. We believe that, in this case, any adjustment to be made because of EDF\u2019s failure to prevail on one issue should occur in connection with the consideration of \u201cadjustments to the lodestar.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b139-16\">. Since we can find no explanation of this item, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>other than the categorical notation, and since there is no claim that Mr. Butler completed any legal research or drafting in connection with petitions for rehearing, we find the claim for 16 hours to be excessive. We therefore reduce the allowed time for this item to 4 hours.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"Aer\">. While it is true that EPA and the industry intervenors were not, in a formal sense, acting in privity, it is clear from the history of the litigation in this case that their positions have been closely aligned,</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b141-7\">. For example, if EDF had not joined in the request for a stay of the mandate, there is no assurance that the court would have granted the request without further hearings and/or briefs. In either event, the continued participation of EDF was essential to a successful resolution of the case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b141-12\">. Essentially for the reasons stated in the <em>EDF Reply </em>at 28-29, we can find no merit in EPA\u2019s claim that the 176 hours claimed for Mr. But<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>ler\u2019s participation in post-decision negotiations should be reduced. Mr. Butler\u2019s hours are adequately documented and, as correctly noted by EDF, the agency challenges to these hours are patently flawed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b142-9\">. In the <em>EPA Response, </em>the agency concedes that the hourly rates suggested by EDF \u201care derived from other recent decisions and, therefore, reflect current market values.\" <em>Id. </em>at 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-10\">EDF relies heavily on <em>North Slope Borough v. Andrus, </em>515 F.Supp. 961 (D.C.C.1981), in which the District Court Judge made an inquiry as to the prevailing rates for environmental litigation in the Washington, D. C. area. Following this inquiry, the court in <em>North Slope Borough </em>approved rates \u2014 consistent with those prevailing in the community \u2014 as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-11\">Very Experienced Attorney (over 20 years) $125/hour</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AC\">Experienced Attorney (over 9 years) $110/hour</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AOZ\">Less Experienced Attorney (4-8 years) $80/hour</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AC0\">Inexperienced Attorney (under 4 years) $65/hour</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b142-18\">515 F.Supp. at 966-70.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-19\">In the <em>EPA Response to Supplementary Motion, </em>EPA submitted a list of cases intended to prove that \u201cthe weight of available evidence shows that the prevailing fee rate for civil litigation compensable under federal attorneys\u2019 fee award statutes in this District is below $100/hour for even core litigation time.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 9. However, a majority of the cases cited (31 of 54) were decided before 1981, and many of the recent 1981 cases involve rates plainly comparable to those requested here. Furthermore, EPA has failed to indicate any breakdown in these cases for relative fees awarded for different classes of attorneys <em>(i.e., </em>experienced, inexperienced, etc.), and there is no evidence to support the claim that lower fees are awarded for \u201cout-of-court\u201d work. If anything, the submission by EPA tends to support EDF\u2019s claim on rates.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b142-17\">. It should be emphasized that EPA does <em>not </em>contend that EDF attorneys should have different rates for different portions of the work that each performed. Rather, EPA suggests a <em>single rate </em>for both Mr. Butler and Ms. Warren, albeit lower than the ones claimed by EDF.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b142-20\">. It is true that Ms. Warren drafted several routine pleadings. However, the time involved for this work is too miniscule to be separated and allocated at a different rate.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b143-7\">. Because there is no real challenge to the rate claimed for Mr. Lennett, and because the amount is clearly reasonable on the facts of this case, we approve the full amount requested for him.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b143-8\">. At one point, EPA virtually concedes the validity of EDF\u2019s claim on rates by arguing that, \u201d[h]ere, the efforts of EDF\u2019s counsel were substantially within the range of skill normally expected of attorneys receiving the rates that they suggest.\u201d <em>EPA Response </em>at 22.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b143-22\">. \u201cThe burden of justifying any deviation from the \u2018lodestar\u2019 rests on the party proposing the deviation.\u201d <em>Copeland, </em>641 F.2d at 892.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b146-7\">.
