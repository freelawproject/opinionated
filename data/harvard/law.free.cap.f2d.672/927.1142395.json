Headquartered outside Paris in Saint Cloud, France, Interpol was organized in 1923 to promote mutual assistance and facilitate communications among criminal police authorities in different countries.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Steinberg alleges that Interpol published a document in the United States and in 125 other countries erroneously describing him as a wanted international criminal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-7\">Invoking diversity jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332, and asserting in personam jurisdiction pursuant to the District of Columbia Long Arm Statute, specifically, D.C. Code \u00a7 13-423(a)(1) and (a)(4), Steinberg delivered process in the District of Columbia to United States officials maintaining liaison with Interpol, and in France, to Interpol\u2019s Secretary General at his residence. Interpol and its Secretary General did not acknowledge service and have not appeared in the action. However, on the suggestion of the United States, appearing as amicus curiae, the district court, in February 1980, dismissed the complaint for lack of personal jurisdiction over the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-8\">The district court expressed sympathy with Steinberg\u2019s jurisdictional arguments observing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1006-9\">Interpol appears to occupy a rather ambiguous and shadowy existence in this country. It claims not to exist in the United States, yet it disseminates information here, maintains close liaison with United States law enforcement authorities, is in effect represented in court by the U.S. Department of Justice and, if the complaint is to be believed \u2014 as it must be for present purposes \u2014 defames American citizens in the United States as well as elsewhere.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1006-12\">Appendix (A.) at 297. Nonetheless, the district court read our decision in <em>Sami v. United States, </em>617 F.2d 755, 758-60 (D.C.Cir.1979), as according Interpol blanket immunity \u201cfrom the reach of American tribunals.\u201d It therefore remitted Steinberg \u201cto whatever relief he may be able to secure from [the Court of Appeals] or from the Congress.\u201d A. 297.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-13\">We reverse the judgment dismissing the complaint and direct reinstatement of the action. In extending the <em>Sami </em>ruling as to Interpol beyond the bounds of that controversy,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the district court, tracking the position urged by the United States as amicus curiae, obscured a distinction important to analysis of issues concerning jurisdiction over persons in modem American law. The district court did not differentiate sharply between (1) general, \u201call purpose\u201d adjudicatory authority to entertain a suit against a defendant without regard to the claim\u2019s relationship <em>vei non </em>to the defendant\u2019s forum-linked activity, and (2) specific jurisdiction to entertain controversies based on acts of a defendant that touch and concern the forum. <em>See generally </em>von Mehren &amp; Trautman, <em>Jurisdiction to Adjudicate: A Suggested Analysis, </em>79 Harv.L.Rev. 1121 (1966); <em>cf. Donahue v. Far Eastern Air Transport Corp., </em>652 F.2d 1032, 1034, 1036-37 (D.C.Cir.1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"929\">*929</page-number><em>Sami, </em>to the extent the complaint cited Interpol as a defendant, involved an attempt to invoke general, \u201call purpose\u201d jurisdiction. Plaintiff in that imbroglio stemming from a marital breakdown was a citizen of Afghanistan employed at the International Monetary Fund in Washington, D. C. He left the country with his two children in violation of a Florida court order, and was arrested by German authorities in Frankfurt. His presentations in the litigation identified no communication, here or abroad, during the episode about which he complained that emanated from Interpol itself. The plaintiff in <em>Sami </em>alleged that Interpol was \u201cdoing business\u201d in the District of Columbia.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u201cDoing business,\u201d traditionally, ranked as a basis for general adjudicatory authority. A defendant who \u201cdid business\u201d in the forum could be sued on claims that arose elsewhere, claims that had slim or even no ties to the forum. <em>See </em>4 C. Wright &amp; A. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7\u00a7 1067-69, 1073 (1969) (discussing cases applying the \u201cdoing business\u201d test since <em>International Shoe Co. v. Washington, </em>326 U.S. 310, 66 S.Ct. 154, 90 L.Ed. 95 (1945)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-5\">This ease, by contrast,- involves an invocation of specific, not general, adjudicatory authority, a category encompassing claims arising from forum-linked acts or consequences. Steinberg asserts that Interpol itself initiated a publication that defamed him, and transmitted the offending publication to its liaison in the District of Columbia, as well as to others in Interpol\u2019s network here and abroad. Interpol\u2019s publication, which it disseminated in the District, Steinberg alleges, gave rise in substantial part to the claim in suit. For the reasons developed below, we conclude that, on the record as it now stands, Washington, D. C., is a fair and reasonable place, within due process constraints,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> for the action Stein-berg has commenced and that Interpol was appropriately brought to court under the District of Columbia Long Arm Statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-10\">I. THE EPISODE IN SUIT</p>\n<p id=\"Ai3s\">Steinberg\u2019s complaint identifies an Interpol document, titled \u201cBlue International Notification 500/59-A3674,\u201d describing him as a wanted international criminal who used the alias \u201cMark Moscowitz.\u201d Interpol widely communicated the Notification, Steinberg alleges, to its liaisons, among them, the United States National Central Bureau (USNCB), now located in the Department of Justice, this country\u2019s liaison with Interpol.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In the summer of 1975, on learning of the document and Interpol\u2019s transmission of it to liaisons, Steinberg asserts, he notified Interpol and twice offered proof that the Notification was erroneous. Despite the proof he offered, Steinberg further states, Interpol continued to publish the Notification and other statements associating Steinberg with \u201cMark Moscowitz.\u201d It did so, according to Steinberg, until late July 1976, when Interpol finally conceded Leon Steinberg was not \u201cMark Moscowitz.\u201d Steinberg seeks general and punitive damages for the substantial injury he alleges he has suffered as a result of the Blue International Notification.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-11\">We emphasize the evident difference between Steinberg\u2019s complaint against Interpol and the Interpol forum connections indicated in <em>Sami v. United States, supra. </em>While <em>Steinberg </em>complains solely of communications sent here and to other coun<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"930\">*930</page-number>tries by Interpol itself, in <em>Sami </em>the demonstrated ties between the forum and Interpol were \u201cremote from the wrongs alleged.\u201d The record in <em>Sami </em>did not establish that communications \u201creceived in this forum from abroad\u201d relating to the events in suit \u201cwere initiated by Interpol\u201d; from all that appeared in <em>Sami, </em>the messages sent here from abroad were dispatched by officers acting \u201cstrictly ... as agents of their own states\u2019 governments.\u201d 617 F.2d at 760.</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-4\">II. AUTHORITY TO SUMMON INTERPOL TO RESPOND IN THIS FORUM</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-5\">At the outset, we stress a key feature of this case. The issue posed for decision is not whether the district court here is more or less appropriate than some other forum in the United States for adjudication of the claim in suit. <em>Cf. World-Wide Volkswagen Corp. v. Woodson, </em>444 U.S. 286, 100 S.Ct. 559, 62 L.Ed.2d 490 (1980) (suit against local dealer, although it could not proceed in Oklahoma, could be maintained in New York). The alleged offending Interpol Notification was transmitted to Interpol\u2019s liaison, USNCB, in Washington, D. C., and no forum in this country is suggested to be more suitable than the District of Columbia for consideration of the case. Our task, therefore, is to determine whether Leon Steinberg, a citizen and domiciliary of the United States, may call Interpol to account at all in the United States for a publication Interpol sent here and abroad that Stein-berg claims is a libel, causing him shame, humiliation, and mental suffering.</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-6\">Steinberg has invoked federal court subject matter competence on the basis of the parties\u2019 diversity of citizenship. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332(a)(2). He asserts no claim arising under federal law.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Personal jurisdiction over the defendants, therefore, initially turns on local (state) law, in this case, District of Columbia law. <em>See Arrowsmith v. United Press International, </em>320 F.2d 219 (2d Cir. 1963) (en banc); <em>Ramamurti v. Rolls-Royce Ltd., </em>454 F.Supp. 407 (D.D.C.1978), <em>aff\u2019d mem., </em>612 F.2d 587 (D.C.Cir.1980); 4 C. Wright &amp; A. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 1075, at 309-10 &amp; n.50 (1969). Application of that law, however, is subject to a federal check. In United States jurisprudence, the outer boundaries of a court\u2019s authority to proceed against a particular person or entity is set by a due process measure, imposed on action at the national level by the Fifth Amendment, and on state action by the Fourteenth Amendment. <em>See Donahue v. Far Eastern Air Transport Corp., supra, </em>652 F.2d at 1036 (separate local law, federal check (due process) inquiries are telescoped when state law standard is \u201cany basis [of personal jurisdiction] not inconsistent with the Constitution\u201d); <em>Stabilisierungsfonds Fur Wein v. Kaiser Stuhl Wine Distributors Pty. Ltd., </em>647 F.2d 200, 203 (D.C.Cir.1981) (state law may be coextensive with due process, or it may require connections between defendant or episode in suit and forum beyond these due process commands). We examine first the question whether the District of Columbia Long Arm Statute supplies a rule of competence, <em>i.e., </em>a rule authorizing the exercise of personal jurisdiction, that covers this case. We next consider whether the exercise of jurisdiction over Interpol in this action is compatible with the due process measure.</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-11\">Steinberg relies, in the alternative, on two provisions of the District of Columbia Long Arm Statute. First, he invokes D.C. Code \u00a7 13-423(a)(1), which authorizes the \u201cexercise [of] personal jurisdiction over a person ... as to a claim for relief arising from the person\u2019s ... transacting any business in the District of Columbia.\u201d Second, he cites D.C.Code \u00a7 13-423(a)(4), which provides for suit against a nonresident \u201cwho causfes] tortious injury in the District of Columbia by an act or omission outside the District\u201d so long as the nonresident \u201cregularly does or solicits business, engages in any other persistent course of conduct, or derives substantial revenue from goods <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"931\">*931</page-number>used or consumed, or services rendered in the District of Columbia.\u201d Subsection (a)(4), we believe, provides a rule of competence fully appropriate to the claim in suit. We therefore pretermit the question whether the \u201ctransacting any business\u201d provision, subsection (a)(1), also supports the exercise of personal jurisdiction in this case.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1009-5\">Interpol acted abroad (in France) in transmitting the Notification said to defame Steinberg, and allegedly caused injury to Steinberg in the District and elsewhere when it dispatched the Notification to USNCB and other liaisons.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> But subsection (a)(4) requires something more. The pivotal question with respect to that subsection\u2019s application here is whether Interpol \u201cengages in [a] persistent course of conduct ... in the District of Columbia.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-6\">We emphasize that the \u201cpersistent course of conduct\u201d to which the statute refers denotes connections considerably less substantial than those required to establish general, \u201call purpose\u201d jurisdiction on the basis of \u201cdoing business\u201d in the forum. Subsection (a)(4) is taken from the Uniform Interstate &amp; International Procedure Act (13 U.L.A.) \u00a7 1.03(a)(4). It was the Commissioners\u2019 design, in requiring something more than the in-forum impact at issue in the litigation, to exclude cases in which that impact is an isolated event and the defendant otherwise has no, or scant, affiliations with the forum. <em>See </em>13 U.L.A. at 468-69 (1980) (Commissioners\u2019 Comment); <em>Founding Church of Scientology v. Verlag, </em>536 F.2d 429, 432 (D.C.Cir.1976) (the \u201cpersistent course of conduct\u201d need not be related to the act that caused the injury; all that is required is \u201csome other reasonable connection\u201d between the defendant and the forum). <em>See also </em>Note, <em>The Virginia \u201cLong Arm\u201d Statute, </em>51 Va.L.Rev. 719, 749 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-9\">It is undisputed that the United States, pursuant to statutory authorization, 22 U.S.C. \u00a7 263a, participates in Interpol, that USNCB, situated in the District, acts as this country\u2019s Interpol liaison, and that USNCB regularly sends information to and receives information from Interpol. Even without the further Interpol-Washington, D. C., links indicated in discovery pursued in this action <em>(e.g., </em>dealings between Interpol and United States agencies other than USNCB; meetings here attended by Interpol officers), the subsection (a)(4) \u201cpersistent course of conduct\u201d proviso is met. Interpol has constant liaison with the nation\u2019s capital. Its longstanding ties to this forum, while they do not add up to \u201cdoing business\u201d here,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> suffice to supply the \u201csomething more\u201d subsection (a)(4) requires.</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"932\">*932</page-number>Finally, we find no due process infirmity in the application of subsection (a)(4) to this case. Given the mutually beneficial relationship between Interpol and the United States, and the regular contacts Interpol has with this country and District, we perceive no unfairness to the defendants in requiring them to appear and interpose an answer to Steinberg\u2019s complaint.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Nor is there any suggestion that adjudication in the District would intrude upon the sovereignty of another nation or state of the United States. <em>Cf. World-Wide Volkswagen Corp. v. Woodson, supra, </em>444 U.S. at 291-92, 297, 100 S.Ct. at 564, 567.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Taking into account the nature and quality of the alleged act and tortious injury, \u201cthe convenient administration of justice in all its aspects, including alternative forums,\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and Steinberg\u2019s interest, as a United States citizen and domiciliary, in vindicating his reputation as an individual without a criminal record, we hold that, whatever defenses Interpol and its Secretary General may have to the claim in suit, the litigation is not barred at the threshold for lack of in personam jurisdiction.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1010-7\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-8\">The judgment of the district court is reversed and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-9\">\n<em>It is so ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1006-10\">.

That subsection authorizes the \u201cexercise [of] personal jurisdiction over a person * * * as to a claim for relief arising from the person\u2019s * * * transacting any business in the District of Columbia * * *.\u201d Here, appellant\u2019s cause of action arises directly from Interpol\u2019s constant communications with the USNCB in the District, and in particular from appellee\u2019s alleged publication of a defamatory notice in the District.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Given the broad reach of subsection (a)(1),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Interpol\u2019s activity undoubtedly constitutes the transaction of \u201cany business.\u201d <em>Cf.

ROBINSON, III, with whom Circuit Judge J. SKELLY WRIGHT joins.</p>\n<author id=\"b1011-7\">GINSBURG, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b1011-8\">The petition for rehearing and the supporting brief of amicus curiae United States of America rest in considerable part on a misreading of the panel\u2019s opinion. Appellee Interpol did not appear in the district court, nor did it appear before this court on appeal. When this court reviewed the district court\u2019s order dismissing the complaint, therefore, the record contained no submission by Interpol. The panel opinion, however, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1011-9\">Our decision is based on the record as it now stands.... [W]e do not intend to foreclose any defense, jurisdictional or otherwise, Interpol itself or its Secretary General may raise predicated on material not before us.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1011-11\">At 932 n.13. There is accordingly no occasion for Interpol to seek a remand from this court \u201cfor the purpose of allowing it to prove that the factual allegations set forth in appellant\u2019s complaint that are the basis of [the] finding of jurisdiction are untrue.\u201d The panel opinion does not in any way foreclose Interpol from proving facts relevant to jurisdiction; the presentation Interpol proposes in its rehearing petition would thus be \u201cconsistent with [the panel\u2019s] opinion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-12\">We further note that no question of an official or foreign sovereign immunity defense to Steinberg\u2019s action was raised before the panel. The court decided only the threshold issue of in personam jurisdiction on the existing record. The opinion leaves no doubt that this court has not precluded Interpol and its Secretary General from raising in the district court \u201cwhatever defenses [they] may have to the claim in suit.\u201d At 932.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1011-10\"> We regard as moot, in view of our disposition, Steinberg\u2019s motion to strike Interpol\u2019s petition for rehearing. Steinberg\u2019s request for attorney\u2019s fees is premature and may be addressed by the district court should Steinberg decide to raise the question there.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b1011-13\">SPOTTSWOOD W. ROBINSON, III, Chief Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"ALm\">with whom</p>\n<judges id=\"A0S\">J. SKELLY WRIGHT, Circuit Judge, joins, concurring in denial of rehearing:</judges>\n<p id=\"b1011-14\">Interpol, which now appears in this litigation for the first time, complains that we accepted as true Steinberg\u2019s factual allegations relating to jurisdictional contacts. That indeed we did so is something for which Interpol bears full responsibility. Interpol could readily have utilized the mechanisms provided by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure enabling participation in the case without jeopardizing its arguments that personal jurisdiction was lacking;<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> instead, it chose simply to ignore Steinberg\u2019s complaint. It filed neither motion nor answer within the time specified by the Rules, and in such circumstances Rule 8(d) authorized treatment of material allegations of the complaint as admitted.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1012-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"934\">*934</page-number>Interpol seeks to extricate itself from this self-imposed predicament through a remand \u201cfor the purpose of allowing it to prove that the factual allegations set forth in [Stein-berg\u2019s] complaint that are the basis of this Court\u2019s finding of jurisdiction are untrue.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> When earlier we resolved Steinberg\u2019s appeal, we were not, of course, presented with a need to rule on the current status of defending parties who fail timely to tender any motion or responsive pleading, and we were careful not to obstruct any path the District Court might properly travel on remand.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Accordingly, as my colleagues state, our disposition does not, by its own force, preclude Interpol from now presenting whatever evidence on the jurisdictional point it has belatedly decided to proffer. In my view however, the question whether Interpol may do so rests, in the first instance with the District Court, which has at least two considerations to address in regard to such a request. As already noted, the effect of Rule 8(d) must be assessed. Additionally, the District Court\u2019s docket reveals that Steinberg has moved, pursuant to Rule 55,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> for a default judgment; apparently that motion has not been ruled on.</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-4\">In essence, our prior decision put the case in the posture it would have assumed had the District Court itself determined the jurisdictional point in Steinberg\u2019s favor. As the case thus remains, Interpol stands before the court an unresponsive defendant, and Rules 8 and 55 may affect its freedom now to contest the allegations of the complaint. Having decided to sit out the game rather than challenge Steinberg\u2019s hand compliably with the rules, Interpol must deal as best it can with the consequences of its gamble.</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-7\">Interpol also vigorously argues various issues of immunity. As my colleagues have noted, this action has yet to proceed to the point where these may become relevant, and no question of official or sovereign immunity was tendered on appeal. We ruled simply on the question of personal jurisdiction, and it is generally accepted that immunity is not a facet of that issue.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1012-8\">Finally, I address briefly points raised in a motion by Steinberg to strike Interpol\u2019s petition for rehearing. One can readily sympathize with Steinberg\u2019s frustrations over the exceedingly peculiar manner in which this case is being \u201cdefended.\u201d Interpol, perhaps wishing to dramatize the argument that it has no existence in or palpable contact with this jurisdiction, has, until the instant petition, refused to materialize in court; instead, its thoughts and desires have been imparted through the United States acting as medium. Yet, no one has revealed to us any special dispensation relieving Interpol of an obligation to abide by the Civil Rules just as any other mortal. It therefore seems safe to presume that the District Court on remand will ensure that this case either proceeds in accordance with established procedures or is terminated in conformity with them; with denial of the petition it is unnecessary to consider further Steinberg\u2019s motion to strike. As for his request for attorney\u2019s fees, I believe that any question of sanctions against Interpol is more appropriately for the District Court as part of its determination of the current status of the action. That court is better able to grapple with the problems <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"935\">*935</page-number>bred by the anomalous procedural route that Interpol has pursued, and it is not for us to predetermine the course of the case on remand.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1011-15\">.
