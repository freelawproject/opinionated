The district court denied appellant\u2019s motion for preliminary injunction and granted the Government\u2019s motion for summary judgment on the ground that it had no subject matter jurisdiction in this case. For reasons outlined in detail below, we hold that the district court erred in this conclusion. We reverse and remand for further proceedings on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b1039-17\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1039-18\">A. <em>Facts</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1039-19\">Megapulse, Inc. is a corporation founded by Dr. Paul Johannessen for the development, manufacture, and sale of long-range (Loran) navigation transmitter equipment embodying a pulsing circuit system known as a megatron, developed by Dr. Johannes-sen.</p>\n<p id=\"b1039-20\">Feeling that his development in transmission circuitry might have valuable military as well as commercial application, Johannessen invited the Coast Guard in May 1970 to witness a demonstration of a Loran-C type transmitter utilizing the megatron.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As a result of this demonstration, Mega-pulse and the Coast Guard entered into a series of agreements, beginning in August 1970, for the demonstration and development of megatron transmitter technology for government-use power levels.</p>\n<p id=\"b1039-21\">The first contract required Megapulse to construct and test a demonstration model Loran-C transmitter and submit a report with test results and recommendations. Two provisions of this contract related to technical data. One listed several patents and patent applications on which the demonstration model was based and stated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A95\">[wjhile the U.S. Coast Guard will be granted rights to data relating to the demonstration model transmitter to be constructed under the proposed contract the use of the same will be subject to the above patent rights under which no license is hereby granted at this time other than freely to use the demonstration model transmitter.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"A41\">A second provision granted the government the right to \u201cduplicate, use and disclose in any manner and for any purpose whatsoever, and have others so do, all or any part of the technical data delivered by the Contractor to the Government under this contract.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1040-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"962\">*962</page-number>Additional contracts were entered into in January and September 1971 containing similar provisions relating to rights in data. The final contract, dated 5 December 1975, required the delivery of a pre-production prototype and provided that all data first produced in performance of the contract would become the property of the government. Data not first produced in performance of the contract was to remain property of the contractor; the government were to acquire the right to use them and to authorize others to use them unless the data were entitled to limit rights protection at the time they were delivered to the government. A portion of the engineering drawings and specifications submitted by Mega-pulse under the contract in November 1977 was marked with a legend, \u201climited rights data.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1040-4\">In the Spring of 1978 the parties entered negotiations on the form of the license agreement to be issued by Megapulse to prospective bidders on a contract to supply Loran-C transmitters to the Coast Guard. The appellant claimed limited rights protection for a comprehensive list of data at that time, apparently without opposition from the Coast Guard. In August 1978 the Coast Guard announced a procurement of Loran-C transmitters which included notification that those wishing to bid would be required to execute licenses before receiving the data package. The required licenses preserved Megapulse\u2019s commercial rights in those portions of the data package in which it claimed a valid proprietary interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b1040-9\">After several bidders objected to the terms of the licenses,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the Coast Guard informally reviewed the proprietary status of the \u201climited rights\u201d data and determined that it was unlikely that significant portions of the processes described in that data were developed'entirely at Megapulse\u2019s expense. As a result of this determination, the Coast Guard advised Megapulse in May 1979 that it would remove all restrictions against commercial use of its proprietary data in the bid solicitation. Megapulse protested this decision to the General Accounting Office (GAO) on 29 May 1979, and filed suit in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia to enjoin the Coast Guard\u2019s release of the proprietary data pending the GAO decision. Following a preliminary hearing, the government agreed not to issue the solicitation without protecting the data pending resolution of the GAO protest; Megapulse withdrew its motion before the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1040-10\">On 15 January 1980 the GAO issued an opinion denying appellant\u2019s protest on the ground that Megapulse had failed to meet its burden of showing no reasonable basis for the agency\u2019s determination that the data were not entitled to limited rights treatment.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Following a 28 May 1980 GAO denial of Megapulse\u2019s request for reconsideration, Megapulse once again filed an action for injunctive relief in the district court, founding subject matter jurisdiction on, inter alia, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 702.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Notice by the Coast Guard on 2 October 1980 of its intention to proceed with the solicitation by about 1 December <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"963\">*963</page-number>1980 <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> precipitated Megapulse\u2019s motion for preliminary injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1041-5\">In connection with its motion for preliminary injunction, Megapulse identified, out of approximately 4,000 documents delivered to the Coast Guard, six specific drawings in the solicitation data package, restriction on release of which would at least minimally protect its commercial interests in the methods and techniques for manufacturing the megatron.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> It argued that unrestricted release of this data violates the Trade Secrets Act<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and deprives Megapulse of its property without due process of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1041-6\">B. <em>Disposition by the District Court</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1041-7\">The district court indicated at oral argument on appellant\u2019s motion for preliminary injunction that Megapulse had set out a case for injunctive relief if the court had power to address the merits of the case.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The key issue, however, was whether the court had subject matter jurisdiction over plaintiff\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1041-11\">The court noted that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Chrysler Corp. </em>v. Brown<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> held that a district court has jurisdiction to enjoin an alleged violation of the Trade Secrets Act. It also noted, however, the \u201cwell-established rule [under the Tucker Act] that jurisdiction over government contract disputes lies exclusively in the Court of Claims, which cannot issue an injunction.\u201d <footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Faced with the question of whether a government contractor can step outside <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"964\">*964</page-number>the Tucker Act and seek an injunction in the district court to prevent an alleged violation of the Trade Secrets Act when the data involved were originally provided to the government pursuant to the terms of various contracts, the district court described it as a \u201cclose and difficult question whether the logic in <em>Chrysler </em>should be extended to allow this court to find jurisdiction in the present case.\u201d <footnotemark>14</footnotemark> In the end, the court found room to distinguish <em>Chrysler,</em><footnotemark><em>15</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and felt compelled to follow this court\u2019s position in <em>International Engineering Co., Division of A-T-O, Inc. v. Richardson,</em><footnotemark><em>16</em></footnotemark><em> </em>which found under facts similar to those of the instant case that the district court had no jurisdiction to enjoin agency disclosure of information. Appellant challenges the district court\u2019s conclusion and the propriety of its adherence to <em>International Engineering.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1042-4\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b1042-5\">The ultimate issue in this case was clearly described by the district court: \u201cwhether a party to a government contract can seek an injunction in [district] court to prevent an alleged violation of the Trade Secrets Act when the disputed data was [sic] divulged to the government in order to fulfill the terms of various contracts.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> As simply as it is stated, this single issue actually combines two separate inquiries: (1) Does the district court have subject matter jurisdiction over Megapulse\u2019s request for injunctive relief? (2) If so, is the district court\u2019s jurisdiction limited in any way by sovereign immunity? <footnotemark>18</footnotemark> We address each in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b1042-11\">A. <em>Subject Matter Jurisdiction</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1042-12\">Megapulse, relying upon the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Chrysler, </em>argues that the district court has subject matter jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331(a) (federal question jurisdiction). The Government counters with an argument that <em>Chrysler </em>does not apply under the facts of this case and that the district court was correct in adhering to this court\u2019s holding in <em>International Engineering. </em>As a first step, therefore, we are faced with determining if the relevant part of <em>International Engineering </em>has in fact survived <em>Chrysler </em>in a form helpful to our analysis in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1042-13\">In <em>International Engineering </em>a government contractor (IEC) brought an action to prevent the Air Force from disclosing to third parties data from technical reports related to IEC\u2019s work on Loran G/D bomb/missile guidance systems and delivered to the Air Force pursuant to contract. IEC claimed proprietary interest in the data contained in some of the reports and had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"965\">*965</page-number>marked affected material with a notice of \u201climited rights,\u201d restricting the Air Force\u2019s distribution rights in the data. IEC argued that the unit upon which the reports were based had been developed and built solely at contractor expense and had \u201cbeen made available for this effort on a no charge loan basis.\u201d The Air Force questioned the propriety of the restrictive legend and the contracting officer notified IEC of the Air Force\u2019s intentions to utilize the data with unlimited rights.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1043-5\">In its suit of 10 May 1973 for declaratory and injunctive relief, IEC sought judicial review of the contracting officer\u2019s decision to strike the proprietary notice, characterizing it as agency action reviewable under Section 10 of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA).<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1043-6\">The district court determined that it had jurisdiction in the matter<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> and ultimately entered a preliminary injunction.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> This court reversed on appeal and remanded the case with instructions to vacate the injunction and dismiss the ease for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> The holding that the district court had no jurisdiction to grant the relief sought was based upon the conclusions of three \u201cconverging avenues of analysis\u201d: (1) the gravamen of IEC\u2019s complaint was for breach of contract; the matter was thus within the jurisdiction of the Court of Claims which could grant no injunctive relief;<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> (2) the decision by the agency officer to strike the limited rights designation did not constitute \u201cagency action\u201d reviewable under the APA;<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> (3) monetary damages were sufficient relief in this case, and since the APA itself states that judicial review under the APA is inappropriate where there exists \u201cother adequate remedy in a court,\u201d there was no need to grant APA review.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> We are convinced that <em>Chrysler </em>effectively counters that portion of the <em>International Engineering </em>opinion which found no district court jurisdiction to review the agency\u2019s disclosure decision under the APA (avenue 2), and impacts significantly upon the other two \u201cavenues.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1043-19\">In <em>Chrysler </em>a government contractor plaintiff sought to enjoin government disclosure of certain data supplied pursuant to regulation to the Defense Department\u2019s Defense Logistics Agency.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> After rejecting propositions that Chrysler had a cause of action under the Freedom of Information Act<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> or an implied right of action under the Trade Secrets Act,<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> the Supreme Court held that a decision to disclose <em>is </em>an \u201cagency action\u201d under Section 10 of the APA and that a disclosure which would arguably violate the Trade Secrets Act is reviewable as an action \u201cnot authorized by law.\u201d A private cause of action thus exists, under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"966\">*966</page-number>APA, for the supplier of data \u2014 a person \u201cadversely affected or aggrieved.\u201d<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1044-4\">The Government would have us distinguish <em>Chrysler </em>from both <em>International Engineering </em>and this case, arguing that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AVzD\">agency action exists in the <em>Chrysler </em>situation because the rights with regard to the information is [sic] defined by statute in the FOIA and the Trade Secrets Act. In contrast, information submitted pursuant to a contract [as in the instant case] is releasable according to the terms of that contract; not the terms of a statute.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"A30\">We understand the distinction the Government is trying to make but we find no merit in it. First of all, the distinction presumes a fact as yet unestablished on the merits \u2014 that the information which Mega-pulse is trying to protect actually falls within the scope of the contract. Appellant claims that the information involved \u201cwas not developed under the contract at all . . . [but] was submitted to the Coast Guard only to comply with performance requirements for non-commercial application and thus was not governed by the contract at all.\u201d<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> We are disinclined to accept the Government\u2019s prejudgment of the ultimate (and as yet untried) merits of the action as a basis for a jurisdictional ruling at this stage.</p>\n<p id=\"b1044-5\">Secondly, the Government\u2019s suggestion that \u201cagency action\u201d may be involved when an agency official decides to disclose information provided by a government contractor pursuant to <em>regulation, </em>but that no \u201cageney action\u201d exists when data subject to the disclosure were supplied to the agency pursuant to <em>contract, </em>is unacceptable. In this case, as in <em>Chrysler, </em>the \u201cagency action\u201d exists in the official decision to disclose \u201cprotected\u201d data. In both cases the supplier of the information claims that insofar as disclosure would violate the Trade Secrets Act the agency was \u201cnot authorized by law\u201d under the APA. <em>Chrysler </em>was clear in holding that the Trade Secrets Act was applicable to agency disclosure and that the data supplier alleging violation of that Act was an \u201caggrieved party\u201d with a cause of action under the APA.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> To the extent that this court\u2019s position in <em>International Engineering </em>was based on a conclusion to the contrary, it is therefore limited by <em>Chrysler.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1044-10\">B. <em>Limitations on Jurisdiction</em></p>\n<p id=\"Amxv\">While we recognize that <em>Chrysler </em>opened an avenue for private causes of action under the APA which this court considered closed at the time of <em>International Engineering, </em>we disagree with appellant\u2019s argument that <em>Chrysler </em>alone is dispositive of the matter at hand. It simply did not address all necessary issues. The Supreme Court identified a technical basis for injunctive relief against agency violation of the Trade Secrets Act, but it was not necessary under the facts in <em>Chrysler </em>to consider the possible conflict between jurisdiction over APA-based claims and the restricted role of the federal courts in contract actions under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"967\">*967</page-number>the Tucker Act. By contrast, because these Tucker Act-related concerns dominated <em>International Engineering, </em>they are central to our discussion of the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1045-5\">It is apparent from a careful reading of <em>International Engineering </em>that the \u201cavenues of analysis\u201d described in that opinion converge at a single point of concern \u2014 that to allow suit against the United States under the APA in actions actually based on contract would create such inroads into the restrictions of the Tucker Act that it would ultimately result in the demise of the Court of Claims.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> The fear finds root in the perceived conflict between the APA\u2019s broad waiver of sovereign immunity and the limited waiver afforded by the Tucker Act in actions based on government contracts.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1045-6\">As indicated in <em>International Engineering, </em>the Tucker Act may be read to include more than a jurisdictional scheme. For contract actions at least, the Act also grants a limited waiver of sovereign immunity, allowing suit but limiting the Court of Claims to monetary relief only. The Court of Claims \u201cmay neither grant declaratory ... nor injunctive relief.\u201d<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> We continue to believe that this is a fair reading of the Act, and we agree that a plaintiff whose claims against the United States are essentially contractual should not be allowed to avoid the jurisdictional (and hence remedial) restrictions of the Tucker Act by casting its pleadings in terms that would enable a district court to exercise jurisdiction under a separate statute and enlarged waivers of sovereign immunity, as under the APA.</p>\n<p id=\"b1045-11\">This concern for preserving the integrity of the Tucker Act is not unique to this court or to contract actions in particular. Courts have not hesitated to look beyond the pleadings of a case brought in district court to determine if it involves a claim over which the Court of Claims has exclusive jurisdiction.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> Thus, in <em>Graham v. Henegar</em><footnotemark><em>38</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the Fifth Circuit observed,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1045-12\">Because adjudication in a federal district court of a lawsuit that falls within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of Claims would seriously undermine the purposes of the Tucker Act, courts confronting the issue have consistently held that the Court of Claims is the sole forum for the adjudication of such a claim, even though the claim would otherwise fall within the coverage of some other statute conferring jurisdiction on the district court.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1045-13\">We reemphasize the position of this court, stated in <em>International Engineering, </em>that an action against the United States which is at its essence a contract claim lies within the Tucker Act and that a district court has no power to grant injunctive relief in such a case. We disagree, however, with the district court\u2019s reading of <em>International Engineering </em>to suggest that <em>any </em>case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"968\">*968</page-number>requiring <em>some </em>reference to or incorporation of a contract is necessarily <em>on the contract </em>and therefore directly within the Tucker Act. We do not believe that such a broad test was intended in <em>International Engineering, </em>and we refuse to adopt it here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1046-4\">The classification of a particular action as one which is or is not \u201cat its essence\u201d a contract action depends both on the source of the rights upon which the plaintiff bases its claims, and upon the type of relief sought (or appropriate). Where there is only one possible basis for jurisdiction, as was assumed in <em>International Engineering, </em>the classification need not be a narrow one. But where there is a possible alternative basis for jurisdiction independent of the Tucker Act, such as is arguably the case before us, we must be more deliberate in our examination. Although it is important on the one hand to preserve the Tucker Act\u2019s limited and conditioned waiver of sovereign immunity in contract actions, we must not do so in terms so broad as to deny a court jurisdiction to consider a claim that is validly based on grounds other than a contractual relationship with the government. The broad language of <em>International Engineering, </em>while appropriate there, is little help to our present analysis, which turns now to a closer look at the \u201ccompeting\u201d bases of jurisdiction in this case and to determine if the claim so clearly presents a disguised contract action that jurisdiction over the matter is properly limited to the Court of Claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b1046-5\">1. <em>Proprietary right vs. contract right</em></p>\n<p id=\"AH9\">Contract issues may arise in various types of cases where the action itself is not founded on a contract. A license, for example, may be raised as a defense in an action for trespass, or a purchase contract may be raised to counter an action for conversion. But the mere fact that a court may have to rule on a contract issue does not, by triggering some mystical metamorphosis, automatically transform an action based on trespass or conversion into one on the contract and deprive the court of jurisdiction it might otherwise have. As this court observed in <em>de Magno v. United States,</em><footnotemark><em>40</em></footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ajqq\">It is not at all unusual for a court to find it necessary in the course of deciding a dispute over which it does have jurisdiction to decide an issue which would be outside its jurisdiction if raised directly. For example, in deciding a conversion action, a court may have to determine title to property in another state, a question which it would have no competence to decide directly. Or in a contract action in state court, the court may find it necessary to decide the merits of the defendant\u2019s position that the contract was in violation of the federal antitrust laws, an issue,'which is within the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal courts if raised directly. While a court\u2019s lack of jurisdiction to decide an issue <em>directly </em>may affect the collateral estoppel effect of the particular factual determination, ... <em>it does not limit the court\u2019s power to decide the question to the extent it is relevant to the dispute over which it does have jurisdiction.</em><footnotemark><em>41</em></footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1046-10\">Even though the Court of Claims is accepted as having exclusive jurisdiction over all contract disputes over $10,000, it certainly has no corner on the power to consider contract-related issues arising in other actions.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> The Supreme Court many years ago recognized a private party\u2019s cause of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"969\">*969</page-number>action outside the Tucker Act to challenge the statutory authority of federal officials to claim ownership, rights in property allegedly transferred during the course of a contract. In <em>Land v. </em>Dollar<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> stockholders in a private company transferred shares of corporate stock to the Federal Maritime Commission in exchange for a release by the Commission from certain obligations, the grant of an operating subsidy, and the extension of a loan. Following repayment of the loan, a dispute ensued as to whether the stock had been sold to the Commission or merely pledged. The shareholders sued in the District Court for the District of Columbia for recovery of the stock. The Supreme Court affirmed this court\u2019s ruling that the District Court had jurisdiction to consider the claim since a determination that the suit involved property of the United States, as to which sovereign immunity existed, prejudged the ultimate merits of the action.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> In language of particular relevance here, the Court explained,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1047-5\">[PJublic officials may become tort-feasors by exceeding the limits of their authority. And where they unlawfully seize or hold a citizen\u2019s realty or chattels, recoverable by appropriate action at law or in equity, [the aggrieved party] is not relegated to the Court of Claims to recover a money judgment.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1047-6\">Subsequent court rulings have made clear that the jurisdictional bar of sovereign immunity in property disputes arising from contractual relationships does not necessarily apply where the government defendants are charged with having acted beyond the scope of their statutory authority.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1047-14\">We are convinced that Megapulse\u2019s claims against the Government are not \u201cdisguised\u201d contract claims. Megapulse has gone to great lengths to demonstrate that it is not relying on the contract at all. It does not claim a breach of contract, it has limited its request for relief to only six documents \u201creflecting the essence of the proprietary technology developed ... <em>prior </em>to the parties\u2019 first contract,\u201d<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> it seeks no monetary damages against the United States,<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> and its claim is not properly characterized as one for specific performance.<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> Appellant\u2019s position is ultimately based, not on breach of contract, but on an alleged governmental infringement of property rights and violation of the Trade Secrets Act. It is actually the Government, and not Megapulse, which is relying on the contract, attempting to show that the Coast Guard lawfully came into possession of the property and is empowered by the contract to put the entrusted information out for commercial use. As indicated above, we do not accept the Government\u2019s argument that the mere existence of such contract-related issues must convert this action to one based on the contract. This court retains the power to make rational distinctions between actions sounding genuinely in con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"970\">*970</page-number>tract and those based on truly independent legal grounds. This is not a case \u201cfalling squarely under the Tucker Act,\u201d<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> as the district court assumed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1048-4\">2. <em>Adequacy of a legal remedy</em></p>\n<p id=\"AVL\">The Government argues that, even if the district court may technically have jurisdiction under \u00a7 1331 because of the federal questions involved in determining whether the Coast Guard\u2019s actions violate the Trade Secrets Act, the APA itself, in \u00a7 704, states that judicial review is inappropriate where there exists some \u201cother adequate remedy in a court.\u201d <footnotemark>51</footnotemark> The Government then turns to <em>International Engineering </em>to support its contention that the availability of money damages in the Court of Claims in this type of action is an \u201cadequate remedy.\u201d We do not read from the APA the <em>per se </em>rule the Government seems to suggest. The question of adequacy may be resolved only against the facts of each case. While we acknowledge the court\u2019s conclusion in <em>International Engineering </em>that monetary relief was possible and adequate in that case, we do not believe that a similar conclusion is required here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1048-5\">The technical data which Megapulse seeks to protect in this case relate to the \u201cdetailed manufacturing processes and techniques followed in constructing the megatron, [which] could not be built without knowing these methods.\u201d<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> Unlike the data in <em>International Engineering, </em>which the Government characterized as \u201cuseless except for what not to do,\u201d<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> the megatron is allegedly a valuable and working circuit system of enormous commercial value to Megapulse and of particular usefulness in the private sector when utilized at lower power ranges.<footnotemark>54</footnotemark> As appellant maintains, \u201c[T]he trade secrets here at issue represent the very economic life blood of Mega-pulse.\u201d<footnotemark>55</footnotemark> Assuming an adequate preliminary support of these allegations,<footnotemark>56</footnotemark> there is no basis in the Government\u2019s reliance on APA \u00a7 704 as denying jurisdiction to the district court to grant preliminary relief and to make an ultimate determination on the merits.<footnotemark>57</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1048-15\">Finally, the Government argues that the relief sought by Megapulse is tantamount to a request for specific performance of a government contract and that such relief may not be granted under the APA. First, it posits that the Tucker Act implicitly forbids specific performance by granting no equitable jurisdiction to the Court of Claims. It then points to language in \u00a7 702 stating that nothing in the section entitling parties to judicial review of agency action and waiving sovereign immunity</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AHgP\">(1) affects other limitations on judicial review or the power or duty of the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"971\">*971</page-number>to dismiss any action or deny relief on any other appropriate legal or equitable ground; or (2) confers authority to grant relief if any other statute that grants consent to suit expressly or impliedly forbids the relief which is sought.<footnotemark>58</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AHOo\">It concludes that the district court has no power to grant injunctive relief in this case. We are not willing to follow this line of logic.</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-5\">It is one thing to rely on the generally recognized rule that a plaintiff cannot maintain a contract action in either the district court or the Court of Claims seeking specific performance of a contract. It is quite another to claim, as the Government does in this case, that an agency action may not be enjoined, even if in clear violation of a specific statute, simply because that same action might also amount to a breach of contract. Government\u2019s counsel admitted at oral argument that by the logical inference of its position the government could avoid injunctions against activities violative of a statutory duty simply by <em>contracting </em>not to engage in those activities. Because government involvement in any such activities would thereby also constitute a breach of a contract term, any injunction would be equivalent to an award of specific performance, which, as a matter of public policy, is not available against the government.<footnotemark>59</footnotemark> We cannot accept such an interpretation of the law for many of the same reasons we refuse automatically to classify claims raising contract issues as \u201ccontract actions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-6\">It is clear to us that so long as an action brought against the United States or an agency thereof is not one that should be classified from the outset as a \u201ccontract action\u201d for Tucker Act purposes, its remedies are also not contract-related, and the mere fact that an injunction would require the same governmental restraint that specific (non)performance might require in a contract setting is an insufficient basis to deny a district court the jurisdiction otherwise available and the remedial powers otherwise appropriate. We find no limits, imposed by sovereign immunity, on the district court\u2019s jurisdiction to consider and grant (if appropriate) Megapulse\u2019s request for injunctive relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-10\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-11\">The district court described as the \u201ckey issue\u201d in this case the question of whether it had subject matter jurisdiction over Megapulse\u2019s Trade Secrets Act claims. It concluded that it did not and for that reason declined to rule on the merits. We find that the district court erred in this conclusion, based as it was on a determination that appellant\u2019s action fell within the Tucker Act. It is clear to us that Megapulse has not brought a contract action or an otherwise disguised claim for monetary relief against the United States. This action was properly brought under the APA, and injunctive relief, preliminary or permanent, is available in the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-12\">The summary judgment for the Government is therefore reversed and the case is remanded; the district court is free to proceed on the merits of appellant\u2019s claim and to grant such non-monetary relief as it finds appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-13\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1039-14\">.

Brown </em>and other cases involving trade secrets furnished at the compulsion of government regulation rest on the premise that it is the government\u2019s best interest to permit parties who consider themselves aggrieved to litigate to prevent government disclosure of trade secrets, because by doing so the government encourages future voluntary compliance with the relevant regulations. It is no different when a contract, rather than regulation, requires the furnishing of information. Only by allowing injunctive relief, when appropriate, will the government encourage entrepreneurs who have a corner on valuable technical data openly to contract with and benefit the government. If a company cannot be assured that it can protect proprietary data after furnishing it pursuant to contract, there will be few eager to enter those contracts.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
