BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b220-20\">This action, which is before the court for the fourth time, arises from a complaint filed over fourteen years ago by Manuel Gomez alleging that the officers of the Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia (MPD) routinely engage in unlawful and unconstitutional behavior during police-initiated encounters with pedestrians. The facts that led to the filing of the original complaint are set out in some detail in the prior opinions of this court. <em>See Gomez v. Wilson, </em>477 F.2d 411 (D.C.Cir.1973); <em>Gomez v. Wilson, </em>430 F.2d 495 (D.C.Cir.1970); <em>Gomez v. Layton, </em>394 F.2d 764 (D.C.Cir.1968). For purposes of this appeal, it suffices to say that the current thrust of the <em>Gomez </em>complaint is that Gomez and the members of the class he represents have been, and will continue to be, approached and asked questions by police officers who lack any articulable basis for believing that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>a crime has been, is being, or is about to be committed. Consequently, appellees complain that their foi^th amendment right to personal security nas been violated \u2014 they are not free \u201cto walk upon the streets of the Nation\u2019s Capital without police harassment.\u201d Brief for Appellees at 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">A. <em>General Order 304.10 and \u201cContacts\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"AOy\">In 1973 the MPD promulgated General Order 304.10<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> for the purpose of \u201c[establishing] policies and procedures ... governing police-citizen \u2018contacts,\u2019 stops, frisks, and motor vehicle spot checks.\u201d Metropolitan Police Department General Order 304.-10, effective July 1, 1973 (revised August 13, 1978) at 1 [hereinafter <em>General Order]; </em>Joint Appendix (J.A.) at 484-500. The General Order has been revised from time to time to reflect changes in the law and to clarify sections of the order that have proved confusing to the MPD officers.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">The portion of the General Order dealing exclusively with \u201ccontacts\u201d provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-7\">A. <em>Contacts.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-8\">Conduct by an officer which places him in face-to-face communication with an individual under circumstances in which the individual is free to leave if he wishes is considered a \u201ccontact.\u201d Contacts may be initiated by an officer when he reasonably believes that investigation of a situation is justified. The standard for a police citizen-contact [sic] is not \u201cprobable cause,\u201d \u201creasonable suspicion,\u201d or any other specific indication of criminal activity. While an officer may initiate a contact for any legitimate purpose, contacts shall not be conducted in a hostile, aggressive manner, or as a means of harassing individuals or coercing them to leave the area. Contacts shall not be initiated merely because a person is \u201changing around,\u201d \u201cloitering,\u201d or \u201cstanding on the corner,\u201d unless the overall circumstances are such as would reasonably arouse the curiosity, concern, or suspicion of the officer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-12\">1. Initiating a Contact.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-13\">An officer may initiate a contact with a person in any place in which the officer has a right to be....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-14\">2. Conduct of Contacts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-15\">Persons \u201ccontacted\u201d may not be detained against their will or frisked. They may not be required to answer the officer\u2019s questions or in any way respond to the officer if they choose not to do so. The officer may not use force or coercion to attempt to require citizens to stop or respond. If they refuse to co-operate, they <em>must </em>be permitted to go on their way; however, if it seems appropriate under the circumstances, they may be kept under surveillance. Since a contact is <em>not </em>a stop or an arrest and the person contacted may be innocent of wrongdoing of any kind, officers should take special care to act in as restrained and courteous a manner as possible.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b222-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number><em>General Order </em>at 1-2; J.A. at 484-85 (emphasis in the original). In contrast, the General Order defines a \u201cstop\" as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AKy\">the temporary detention of a person for the purpose of determining whether probable cause exists to arrest that person. A stop occurs whenever an officer uses his authority to compel a person to halt, or to keep him in a certain place, or to require him to perform some act (such as walking to a nearby location where the officer can use a radio, telephone or call box). If a person is under a reasonable impression that he is not free to leave the officer's presence, a \u201cstop\u201d has occurred.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b222-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 2; J.A. at 485. There is a basis for a stop if \u201c[the] officer <em>reasonably suspects </em>that a person has committed, is committing, or is about to commit any crime.... \u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis in the original).</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">Both types of police-citizen encounters are recorded on a \u201cPD Form 76,\u201d an MPD form that provides space for recording the name, address, race, sex, date of birth, height, weight, eye and hair color, complexion and clothing of the person encountered. In addition, there is a section in which the officer is to record the justification for the stop or contact. Officers are required to maintain records of stops; records of contacts, however, are not mandatory, but may be required by individual commanding, officers. <em>Id. </em>at 16; J.A. at 499. Excluding encounters that result in formal arrests, MPD officers record approximately 14,000 police-citizen encounters per year.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b222-15\">In March 1980, the <em>Gomez </em>plaintiffs filed an amended and supplemental complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief alleging, <em>inter alia, </em>that \u201c[w]hen a police officer \u201ccontacts\u201d a pedestrian pursuant to General Order 804.10 or any other MPD order authorizing such behavior, the officer is making an unreasonable seizure of the pedestrian in violation of the Fourth Amendment.\u201d Second Amended and Supplemental Complaint at 1, <em>Gomez v. Jefferson, </em>Civ. No. 2909-67 (D.D.C. May 13, 1981, as amended May 18, 1981) [hereinafter <em>Gomez v. Jeffer</em>son]; J.A. at 141, 153. Thereafter, both parties moved for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-16\">B. <em>The District Court Order</em></p>\n<p id=\"b222-17\">On May 13,1981, the district court partially granted appellees\u2019 motion for summary judgment and held that the MPD policy and practice of making \u201ccontacts\u201d without an articulable basis for concluding that the person \u201ccontacted\u201d has committed, is committing, or is about to commit a crime is \u201can unlawful intrusion upon personal privacy and violative of the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution.\u201d Memorandum Order at 1, <em>Gomez v. Jefferson; </em>J.A. at 755.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The court defined \u201ccontacts\u201d as \u201cinvestigative interrogations asking pedestrians to identify themselves or account for their presence on the public streets ... . \u201d <em>Id.; </em>J.A. at 755.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>fendant Chief of Police<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> was enjoined from \u201cauthorizing or effectuating any \u2018contacts\u2019 \u201d and was directed to draft for court approval an order directing MPD officers to cease all acts encompassed by the injunction. <em>Id. </em>at 2; J.A. at 756. The court further ordered that \u201cGeneral Order 304.10 and any other order, directive or authority inconsistent with [the court-approved directive] shall be rescinded.\u201d <em>Id; </em>J.A. at 756. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-4\">C. <em>Contentions of the Parties</em></p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">A \u201cseizure\u201d occurs \u201c[o]nly when [an] officer, by means of physical force or show of authority, has in some way restrained the liberty of a citizen ... . \u201d <em>Terry v. Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 19 n.16, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 1879, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968). The parties agree that whether a person has been \u201crestrained\u201d must be determined by reference to an objective standard and that the test in this circuit is \u201c \u2018[whether] a reasonable [person], innocent of any crime, would have thought [he was free to leave] had he been in the defendant\u2019s shoes.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Wylie, </em>569 F.2d 62, 68 (D.C.Cir.1977) (quoting <em>Coates v. United States, </em>413 F.2d 371, 373-74 (D.C.Cir.1969)), <em>cert. denied, </em>435 U.S. 944, 98 S.Ct. 1527, 55 L.Ed.2d 542 (1978). Appellant and appellees part company, however, over the question whether the conduct authorized in General Order 304.10, and specifically a request for identification,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> constitutes, in the mind of the reasonable person, such a restraint on liberty.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-9\">Appellant argues quite simply that \u201ccontacts\u201d as defined by General Order 304.10 are not \u201cseizures.\u201d The thrust of appellant\u2019s argument is that courts using the reasonable person test \u2014 particularly this court \u2014 have found no seizure in a variety of situations where officers approached and directed questions to pedestrians, including requests for identification. Consequently, General Order 304.10, which authorizes no more, cannot be facially invalid. Whether particular conduct constitutes a seizure, it is argued, must be determined oh a case-by-case basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-10\">Appellees, on the other hand, argue that no reasonable person asked to produce identification would feel free to refuse to answer or to leave the presence of a police officer. Therefore, appellees contend, such police conduct must constitute a seizure, and General Order 304.10, which authorizes contacts without an articulable basis, including requests for identification, is facially invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-11\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b223-12\">The Supreme Court has noted that \u201c[pjeople are not shorn of all Fourth Amendment protection when they step from their homes onto the public sidewalks.\u201d <em>Delaware v. Prouse, </em>440 U.S. 648, 663, 99 S.Ct. 1391, 1401, 59 L.Ed.2d 660 (1979). The fourth amendment is not implicated, however, unless there is a \u201cseizure\u201d and the seizure is unreasonable. This case requires us to determine whether a \u201cseizure\u201d occurs when the MPD \u201ccontacts\u201d a pedestrian.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b224-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>The starting point in any case dealing with an alleged \u201cseizure\u201d that does not technically amount to an arrest must be the seminal case of <em>Terry v. Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In <em>Terry, </em>the Court found that \u201cwhenever a police officer <em>accosts </em>an individual <em>and restrains </em>his freedom to walk away, he has \u2018seized\u2019 that person,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 16, 88 S.Ct. at 1877 (emphasis added), and noted that \u201c[o]bviously, not all personal intercourse between policemen and citizens involves \u2018seizures\u2019 of persons.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 19 n.16, 88 S.Ct. at 1879. The Court further instructed that it is \u201c[o]nly when the officer, by means of physical force or show of authority, has in some way restrained the liberty of a citizen [that a court may] conclude that a \u2018seizure\u2019 has occurred.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\">More recently, in <em>United States v. Mendenhall, </em>446 U.S. 544, 100 S.Ct. 1870, 64 L.Ed.2d 497 (1980), Justice Stewart, joined only by Justice Rehnquist, reiterated the <em>Terry </em>seizure standard and espoused the following test to determine whether a \u201crestraint\" has been imposed: \u201conly if, in view of all the circumstances surrounding the incident, a reasonable person would have believed that he was not free to leave.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 553-54, 100 S.Ct. at 1876-1877 (opinion of Stewart, J.) (footnote omitted). Without evidence of some show of authority, however, Justice Stewart felt that \u201cotherwise inoffensive contact between a member of the public and the police cannot, as a matter of law, amount to a seizure of that person.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 555, 100 S.Ct. at 1877. Under the facts presented in that case, Justice Stewart concluded that Mendenhall had not been seized when two federal Drug Enforcement Agents approached her in an airport and requested identification. <em>Id. </em>A majority of the Court, however, did not reach the seizure issue.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b224-10\">The issue is not a new one in this circuit. In <em>Coates v. United States, </em>413 F.2d 371 (D.C.Cir.1969), we were concerned with whether police officers\u2019 initial approach of suspects constituted an arrest. There we noted that \u201c \u2018the test must not be what the defendant himself * * * thought, but what a reasonable man, innocent of any crime, would have thought had he been in the defendant\u2019s shoes.\u2019 \u201d 413 F.2d at 373 (quoting <em>United States v. McKethan, </em>247 F.Supp. 324 (D.D.C.1965)). In addition, we stated that \u201c[a] police officer by merely engaging in conversation with a citizen does not thereby create the requisite restraint on liberty which would constitute an arrest.\u201d 413 F.2d at 374 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b224-11\">More recently, in <em>United States v. Wylie, </em>569 F.2d 62 (D.C.Cir.1977), the question concerned whether an officer\u2019s approach of a person and question, \u201cSir, may I talk to you a moment?\u201d accompanied by the officer\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>use of a PD Form 76 constituted a \u201cstop.\u201d The court held that the conduct \u201cconstituted a mere \u2018contact,\u2019 and not a compelled investigative stop and therefore did not require reasonable, articulable grounds for suspecting that appellant had committed a crime.\u201d 569 F.2d at 66. We noted that \u201cpolice-citizen communications which take place under circumstances in which the citizen\u2019s \u2018freedom to walk away\u2019 is not limited by anything other than his desire to cooperate do not amount to \u2018seizures\u2019 of the person and consequently may be initiated without a reasonable, articulable suspicion, much less probable cause.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 67.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">Determining whether the facts in <em>Wylie </em>resulted in a \u201cstop\u201d or a \u201ccontact,\u201d required \u201ca refined judgment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 68. The crucial element of the holding in <em>Wylie </em>was that the seizure issue is always a fact-bound question. As Judge Robinson, now Chief Judge, so eloquently stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-6\">Ofttimes the boundary between voluntary and involuntary on-street colloquy with police officers is elusive. Many people at bottom will think twice before spurning an importuning policeman. This is not to suggest that that circumstance alone makes one inexorably a captive, for if it did no police-citizen investigative contact would ever withstand scrutiny. It is to say that the line of demarcation lies at the point of some different and larger restraint.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b225-7\"><em>Wylie, </em>569 F.2d at 73 (Robinson, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b225-8\">We reaffirm today that in this circuit the test of whether a seizure has occurred is whether a reasonable person, innocent of any crime, would have felt free to walk away under the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-9\">To decide the case at bar, we must apply this test and answer three questions. First, is it <em>always </em>a seizure when a law enforcement officer approaches a person on the street and directs questions to that person? As we explain below, the answer to this question must be no. Second, is it <em>always </em>a seizure when a law enforcement officer approaches a person and requests identification? For the reasons detailed below we disagree with the district court and also answer this question in the negative. Third, in light of our resolution of the first two questions, was the record before the district court sufficient to support the conclusion on summary judgment that the MPD contact program, as practiced, shows a pattern of unconstitutional conduct warranting an injunction? We find that this issue is dependent upon material facts that are in dispute, and accordingly we vacate the injunction and remand the cause to the district court for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-12\">A. <em>Is the Approach and Direction of a Question a \u201cSeizure\u201d?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b225-13\">As noted above, a \u201cseizure\u201d occurs when a police officer, by force or show of authority, restrains the liberty of a citizen. Whether a restraint has occurred is determined, in turn, by reference to the mind of a \u201creasonable person.\u201d Combining the two standards, the ultimate issue is not merely whether a reasonable person confronted by an inquisitive police officer would not feel free to walk away, but more precisely whether such conduct constitutes a <em>show of authority </em>that would lead a reasonable person to conclude that he is not free to go.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-14\">As a threshold matter, we must recognize that a reasonable person is willing, on occasion, to cooperate with the police. A reasonable person is aware, we believe, of the duties of law enforcement officers not only to apprehend criminals, but to keep the peace and, where possible, to prevent the commission of crime. This awareness, coupled with feelings of civic duty,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> moral obligation, or simply proper etiquette, will often lead a reasonable person to cooperate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>with law enforcement officers.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Because a variety of factors may contribute to a person\u2019s decision to acquiesce to an officer\u2019s request, we are unwilling to impute to the reasonable person, as his sole motivation, a fear of official sanction engendered by the mere presence of an authority figure.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-4\">It is not argued that an officer\u2019s request for the time of day or for information concerning the identity of a lost child would constitute a \u201cshow of authority\u201d sufficient to result in a seizure. Nor is it suggested that in emergency situations an officer may not request aid or information from a pedestrian without \u201cseizing\u201d him. Even appellees concede that an officer may approach and question a potential witness without a seizure occurring.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> In all the foregoing circumstances, there is a police-initiated encounter where a reasonable person stops and answers questions, not out of fear of the police, but in a spirit of cooperation.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">The need for questioning as a tool for the effective performance of law enforcement duties is undisputed. <em>See Schneckloth v. Bustamonte, </em>412 U.S. 218, 225, 93 S.Ct. 2041, 2046, 36 L.Ed.2d 854 (1973). Indeed, even a person who has been detained by the police is not presumed to be unwilling to cooperate. The Supreme Court has so held in the context of consent searches. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Mendenhall, </em>446 U.S. 544, 558, 100 S.Ct. 1870, 1879, 64 L.Ed.2d 497 (1980); <em>Schneckloth, </em>412 U.S. at 248, 93 S.Ct. at 2058.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-8\">Accordingly, the presence of the officer as a figure of governmental authority does not, by itself, constitute the \u201cshow of authority\u201d necessary to make a reasonable person feel unfree to leave. There must be some additional conduct by the officer to overcome the presumption that a reasonable person is willing to cooperate with a law enforcement officer.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The approach and direction of a question by a police officer cannot be, as a matter of fact or of law, a seizure of the person so approached.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-9\">B. <em>Is a Police Request for Identification a \u201cShow of Authority\u201d that Restrains a Pedestrian?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b226-10\">The more difficult question we confront in this case is whether the <em>nature of the identification question itself, </em>combined with the fact that the questioner is a police officer, cumulatively creates a sufficient show of authority to constitute a seizure. We hold that the nature of this question alone, without reference to the demeanor of the officer, the tone of voice used, or any other circumstance, cannot convert an otherwise inoffensive encounter into a seizure.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-11\">That a request for identification does not, in all cases, constitute a seizure follows from our analysis in the preceding section. It cannot be disputed that in the course of interviewing potential witnesses police routinely request identification information as well as information concerning when and where a potential witness was at a particular time \u2014 often at the time a crime was committed or shortly thereafter. Appellees <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>have not suggested that they, as mere pedestrians, possess a greater right to be free from police questions concerning identification than a person on the street who may have happened to witness a crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">Moreover, in <em>Wylie </em>this court found that no seizure occurred when an officer approached a person and asked questions, including a request for identification. Although that decision is not dispositive of the case at hand because <em>Wylie </em>involved the application of the \u201cseizure\u201d test to specific facts, it must be accorded substantial precedential value. Appellees\u2019 argument that this court did not pass upon the constitutionality of a \u201ccontact\u201d or the facial validity of that portion of General Order 304.10 in <em>Wylie </em>is disingenuous. As noted above, the finding that the officer\u2019s initial conduct did not constitute a \u201cseizure\u201d was necessary to our holding in <em>Wylie. See </em>page 140, <em>supra. </em>That finding, in turn, necessarily implied that the \u201ccontact\u201d portion of General Order 304.10 was not facially invalid. <em>See Wylie, </em>569 F.2d at 67-68.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">Appellees attempt to distinguish the contacts of which they complain from other police-citizen encounters by contending that \u201cwhen an officer\u2019s <em>questions focus on the pedestrian </em>\u2014 when the officer approaches a pedestrian on the public street, asks for identification or an account of behavior <em>and records the response </em>on a police form \u2014 the pedestrian does not feel free to leave and therefore has been seized.\u201d Brief for Appellees at 14 (emphasis added). Whether a seizure occurs when a question \u201cfocus[es] on the pedestrian\u201d and the officer \u201crecords the response\u201d is, of course, not the issue in this case. The recording of responses adds a factual circumstance not encompassed by the district court\u2019s order.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Moreover, the distinction that appellees attempt to make does not withstand analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-10\">Whether the <em>question </em>asked \u201cfocuses on the pedestrian\u201d cannot be raised to the level of a legal standard, for a request for identification surely focuses on the person asked whether it be a witness to a crime, a person in distress, or a mere pedestrian. The nature of the question becomes relevant only when viewed in the context of surrounding circumstances. Appellees\u2019 true concern appears to be with the <em>officer\u2019s </em>subjective focus on the pedestrian. In order to provide a workable rule, this court applies an objective standard; accordingly, the intent of the officer or the reason behind his decision to approach a pedestrian cannot be the basis upon which we determine whether a seizure has occurred.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> This is not to say, however, that a reasonable person will not feel more intimidated when it appears that he is the subject of a police inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-11\">The nature of the question asked is a proper factor to be considered in determining whether a seizure has occurred. Nonetheless, we are unwilling to state a categorical rule that a request for identification <em>always </em>constitutes a seizure.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>a rule would prevent an officer from legitimately seeking citizen cooperation, particularly from potential witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-4\">An officer\u2019s request for identification, phrased in precatory terms and standing alone, simply is not a \u201cshow of authority.\u201d It may be that such a request, coupled with other factors, could amount to a seizure\u2014 this we cannot determine until presented with a factual background sufficient to render such a judgment. All the facts and circumstances surrounding a police-citizen encounter must be considered \u2014 not merely a single question.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">It is inevitable that in the future both the district court and this court will be called upon to determine whether a particular police-citizen encounter involved an \u201carrest,\u201d a \u201cstop,\u201d or a \u201ccontact.\u201d As we have stressed, such a determination must be considered on the basis of all the circumstances surrounding the encounter. In <em>Mendenhall, </em>Justice Stewart suggested that a \u201cshow of authority\u201d might include \u201cthe threatening presence of several officers, the display of a weapon by an officer, some physical touching of the person of the citizen, or the use of language or tone of voice indicating that compliance with the officer\u2019s request might be compelled.\u201d 446 U.S. at 554, 100 S.Ct. at 1877. (Opinion of Stewart, J.). In assessing whether a particular police-citizen contact results in a seizure, we believe that the demeanor of the approaching officer, the tone of voice used, the nature of the questions asked, and the time and place of the encounter are among the factors to be considered. The reviewing court must examine the totality of the circumstances and apply its informed judgment to the situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">On this score, we note that resolution of the seizure question would be a far easier task if the approaching officer clearly informed the subject that he was free to leave and need not answer any questions or produce identification. Such a warning or statement is not, of course, constitutionally required. <em>See Schneckloth v. Bustamonte, </em>412 U.S. 218, 93 S.Ct. 2041, 36 L.Ed.2d 854 (1973). Although in many cases no single factor can be considered determinative, such a statement would add substantial weight to the argument that a reasonable person, so informed by the police, would have felt free to leave. In view of the persistent problems and continuing litigation police \u201ccontacts\u201d with citizens in the District of Columbia have caused, we strongly recommend that the MPD include this statement in its contact procedure and policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-9\">In sum, we hold that a request for identification cannot constitute, as a matter of law, a show of authority sufficient to convert an innocent encounter into a seizure. The \u201ccontact\u201d portion of General Order 304.10, which authorizes no more, is not facially invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-10\">C. <em>Does the MPD Practice Warrant the Injunction?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b228-11\">Final resolution of this appeal requires us to determine whether the injunction entered by the district court is justified notwithstanding our decision on the seizure issue. In order for the injunction to stand, we must find that the record before the district court was sufficient to support a finding that the practice of MPD \u201ccontacts\u201d is carried out in violation of the fourth amendment. Appellees alleged before the district court that the MPD \u201cstopped\u201d pedestrians under the guise of \u201ccontacting\u201d them and that \u201cstops\u201d were effected without a reasonable articulable basis for suspecting criminal conduct. The Chief of Police denied both allegations. Because this issue concerns material facts which are vehemently disputed, the issue is not an appropriate one for summary judgment. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c). Accordingly, we must vacate the order and remand the case to the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-12\">On remand the district court is directed to hold further proceedings to determine whether the MPD practice of \u201ccontacting\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>pedestrians is carried out in disregard of their fourth amendment rights. The affidavits filed in support of appellees\u2019 motion for summary judgment show that at least some MPD officers engage in conduct that travels far beyond asking a simple question.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Moreover, we find other aspects of the contact practice disturbing. Among our concerns is the use of PD Form 76 cards during \u201ccontacts.\u201d The district court should consider whether the recording of detailed personal information<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> during a police-initiated encounter, coupled with the officer\u2019s presence and the nature of the questions involved, may constitute a \u201cshow of authority\u201d sufficient to transform the encounter into a seizure.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-4\">Although the \u201ccontact\u201d portion of the General Order provides that \u201c[i]f they refuse to cooperate, [pedestrians] <em>must </em>be permitted to go on their way,\u201d <em>General Order </em>at 2; J.A. at 485 (emphasis in the original), we are also concerned with the extent to which MPD officers may use a pedestrian\u2019s silence or refusal to cooperate during a contact as the sole basis for finding \u201creasonable suspicion\u201d to \u201cstop\u201d that person. If an officer can detain a person, by force if necessary, simply because that person exercises his right to refuse to cooperate or answer questions, his freedom to walk away is indeed no freedom at all. This is not to say, of course, that officers may not consider a pedestrian\u2019s answers or reactions during a contact, in conjunction with other factors, as an element contributing to the conclusion that there is a \u201creasonable suspicion\u201d that the pedestrian has committed, is committing, or is about to commit a crime.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Accordingly, on remand the district court should also consider whether the MPD impermissibly uses a pedestrian\u2019s silence or refusal to cooperate during a contact as the <em>sole justification </em>for seizing that person.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b230-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>If it is found that the MPD engages in conduct, masquerading as contacts, that results in the seizure of pedestrians without an articulable basis, the court shall determine whether there exists in the District of Columbia a pervasive pattern of such unconstitutional conduct. <em>See Rizzo v. Goode, </em>423 U.S. 362, 371, 96 S.Ct. 598, 46 L.Ed.2d 561 (1976). If such a pattern exists, the court must determine what relief is warranted by the scope of the violation. <em>See Rizzo, </em>423 U.S. at 378; <em>Allee v. Medrano, </em>416 U.S. 802, 94 S.Ct. 2191, 40 L.Ed.2d 566 (1974). \u201cThe task is to correct, by a balancing of the individual and collective interests, the condition that offends the Constitution.\u201d <em>Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education, </em>402 U.S. 1, 16, 91 S.Ct. 1267, 28 L.Ed.2d 554 (1971). Some limited prophylactic measures might suffice to cure whatever unconstitutional practice may exist, with less intrusion into legitimate police functions than a blanket injunction of the type issued below. Before imposing another judicial remedy, the court should also consider the effectiveness of any official corrective actions taken as a result of this opinion. <em>See Washington Mobilization Committee v. Cullinane, </em>566 F.2d 107, 130 (D.C.Cir.1977) (statement of Leventhal, J.).</p>\n<p id=\"b230-4\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">In conclusion, we find that the nature of a police officer\u2019s question to a pedestrian is but one factor that should be considered in determining whether a person has been \u201cseized.\u201d The presence of that factor alone, however, does not normally constitute a \u201cshow of authority\u201d that leads a reasonable person to conclude that he is not free to go. Accordingly, a police request for identification does not always result in a seizure of the questioned person. To suggest otherwise would prevent an officer from inquiring whether a person who appears to be in distress needs help, from questioning potential witnesses, and from seeking the voluntary cooperation of citizens. Every police-initiated encounter must be considered in light of all the relevant facts and circumstances. Accordingly, the \u201ccontact\u201d provision of General Order 304.10, which states that MPD officers can approach pedestrians and ask questions, is not facially invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-7\">Because the express policy of the MPD is not unconstitutional, the remaining issue in this case, whether the police conduct in question results in unconstitutional \u201cseizures\u201d of pedestrians, is a disputed question of fact and not a proper subject for action on summary judgment. Accordingly, the order of the district court is vacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-8\">\n<em>It is so ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b220-12\">.

Appellant suggests that an MPD contact, even if a seizure, \u201cconstitutes such a minor intrusion upon a pedestrian\u2019s privacy that it need not be justified by a reasonable, articulable suspicion of criminal conduct, much less probable cause, and such questioning is proper as long as it is not wholly capricious.\u201d Brief for Appellant at 9-10 (footnote omitted). The Supreme Court has recognized that brief, relatively unintrusive detentions \u2014 termed \u201cstops\u201d \u2014may be \u201creasonable\u201d if based upon an articulable suspicion. <em>See, e.g., Brown v.

One noted commentator suggests that because there are moral and instinctive pressures to cooperate with the police, \u201c[a] confrontation would amount to a seizure only if the officer added to those inherent pressures by engaging in menacing conduct significantly beyond that which is accepted in social intercourse.\u201d W. LaFave, Search and Seizure, A Treatise on the Fourth Amendment \u00a7 9.2 (2d ed. 1978).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b227-7\">. The effect that the use of a PD Form 76 during a contact may have on the question of whether a \u201cseizure\u201d occurs, an issue not necessary to our decision, is a matter of serious concern to us. <em>See </em>page 145, <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b227-8\">. Although the subjective intent of the officer is not relevant to the seizure issue, it is, of course, relevant in other areas of fourth amendment analysis and in other contexts. For example, intent would be relevant to an allegation that the police impermissibly use race or ethnic background as a factor in finding a \u201creasonable suspicion\u201d to \u201cstop\u201d a pedestrian. In addition, intent would be relevant to an allegation that the practice of \u201ccontacting\u201d pedestrians was carried out in a racially discriminatory manner, or used to harass members of particular minority groups.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b227-12\">. The district court enjoined both \u201casking pedestrians to identify themselves\u201d and asking them \u201cto account for their presence on the public streets.\u201d While we hold that neither type of question constitutes a seizure per se, we believe that only in rare circumstances would a pedestrian expect to have to explain, at the request of a police officer, what he or she was doing in a public place. In the absence of an articulable suspicion, it is hard to imagine why the police would need to know such information. A request for identification alone accomplishes most of the legitimate objectives of the contact procedure. Furthermore, we note that pedestrians, unlike drivers, are not required to carry a driver\u2019s license or any other formal identification papers with them on their walks. See <em>Brown v. Texas, </em>443 U.S. 47, 52, 99 S.Ct. 2637, 2641, 61 L.Ed.2d 357 (1979).

On motion for summary judgment, appellees submitted affidavits detailing police encounters and the PD Form 76 cards completed by the officers involved. Many of the encounters characterized by the police as \u201ccontacts\u201d raise serious questions concerning the propriety of the police conduct. <em>See, e.g., </em>Affidavit of George D.

It is not at all clear from this portion of the text, however, that an officer may not use silence or refusal to cooperate as the sole basis for the assessment. Clarity in this context is both desirable and possible. For example, in the portion of the General Order concerning an officer\u2019s conduct during a \u201cstop,\u201d it is carefully noted: \u201cNeither refusal to answer questions nor to produce identification <em>by itself </em>establishes probable cause to arrest .... \u201d <em>General Order </em>at 7; J.A. at 490 (emphasis added).
