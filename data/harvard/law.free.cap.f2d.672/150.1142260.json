A central purpose of the Act is to provide increased protection for \u201cwhistle-blowers,\u201d federal employees seeking to disclose wrongdoing in the government. The Act authorizes the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB or Board), on petition of an independent Special Counsel, to order \u201ccorrective action\u201d by federal agencies whose officials have sought to retaliate against whistleblowers. Petitioners, four former Deputy U.S. Marshals, seek review of the Board\u2019s first corrective action decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>In a petition to the Board, the Special Counsel contended that the four deputies were transferred from their duty stations because they had (1) complained to two U.S. Congressmen about alleged wrongdoing in the Marshals Service and (2) filed equal employment opportunity grievances against their superiors. Following an evidentiary hearing, the Board upheld the transfers of three of the deputies and rescinded that of the fourth.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">In No. 80-1986, Deputy Frazier, whose transfer was rescinded by the Board, challenges the Board\u2019s conclusion that it lacked authority to award him attorney\u2019s fees. We hold that the CSRA provides such authority in any case in which an employee or applicant for employment appears as a party. We remand for the Board to consider whether fees should be granted in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">In No. 80-1067, all four of the deputies challenge (1) the Board\u2019s authority to hold a hearing, (2) its allocation of the burden of proof, and (3) its standard for judging retaliatory intent. The Board, for its part, suggests that the petition is moot and, in any event, not appealable to this court. We hold that we have jurisdiction to hear the appeal and that the contentions of three of the deputies are not moot; but since the fourth deputy, Frazier, received all the relief he sought, his petition is dismissed as moot. On the merits, we find the Board\u2019s analysis of the issues consistent with the provisions of the Act governing corrective action proceedings. With respect to Deputies Morris, Reilly, and Love, the decision of the Board is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-7\">Because this is the first case interpreting the corrective action provisions of the CSRA, we think it helpful to set forth the legal and factual background in some detail. Accordingly, before discussing the legal issues, we will canvass the history and structure of the relevant sections, the facts that gave rise to the present dispute, and the procedures and conclusions adopted by the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-10\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b237-11\">A. <em>Statutory scheme.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b237-12\">The CSRA constituted the first comprehensive reform of the federal civil service system since passage of the Pendleton Act in 1883. A product of the nineteenth century progressive movement, the Pendleton Act had sought to replace the \u201cspoils system,\u201d under which the President could dispense federal jobs as rewards for political patronage, with a \u201cmerit system\u201d that would base selection and promotion of most civil servants on competence. The Pendleton Act also established a Civil Service Commission charged both with protecting the merit principle and with managing the growing federal bureaucracy.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b237-13\">In subsequent years, an increasing proportion of the federal workforce was classified in the competitive service. As the Commission\u2019s management functions grew more complex, it was also compelled to elaborate a wide variety of merit system rules without guidance from Congress. Delay and inefficiency increasingly characterized the procedures required to discipline unsatisfactory employees.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> At the same time, several celebrated episodes suggested that efforts by employees to call attention to government waste and fraud were often inhibited by the threat of retaliatory personnel actions.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The dual responsibility of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>the Civil Service Commission for management and merit protection seemed to pose a barrier against mitigating these problems.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b238-4\">In 1978, these and other concerns led President Carter to propose legislation that would significantly restructure the civil service. Among the legislative objectives identified by the President in his message to Congress were:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-5\">To strengthen the protection of legitimate employee rights;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-6\">To provide incentives and opportunities for managers to improve the efficiency and responsiveness of the Federal Government; [and]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-7\">To reduce the redtape and costly delay in the present personnel system[.]<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b238-8\">Another important purpose of the proposals, as noted by the legislation\u2019s Senate manager, Senator Ribicoff, was to \u201c[p]rovide[] new protections for employees who disclose illegal or improper Government conduct.\"<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b238-9\">As enacted, the CSRA includes several basic features intended to achieve these goals. Title I of the Act consists of the first statutory expression of the merit system principles that have evolved since the creation of the Civil Service Commission. In addition to detailing the requirement that personnel decisions rest on evaluations of competence, Title I announces a statutory policy of protecting whistleblowers. The Act provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-10\">Employees should be protected against reprisal for the lawful disclosure of information which the employees reasonably believe evidences\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-11\">(A) a violation of any law, rule, or regulation, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-17\">(B) mismanagement, a gross waste of funds, an abuse of authority, or a substantial danger to public health or safety.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b238-18\">Section 2301(b)(9).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Title I also defines a variety of \u201cprohibited personnel practices\u201d including actions taken in retaliation for whistleblowing, section 2302(b)(8), and those taken as a reprisal \u201cfor the exercise of any appeal right granted by any law, rule, or regulation.\u201d Section 2302(b)(9).</p>\n<p id=\"b238-19\">Title II of the CSRA abolishes the Civil Service Commission and replaces it with two new agencies, the MSPB and the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). The OPM, headed by a single director responsible to the President, supervises the administration of the civil service. The MSPB, an independent agency consisting of three members, is charged with protecting the merit system principles and adjudicating conflicts between federal workers and their employing agencies. <em>See </em>sections 1201-05. The Act also establishes within the Board an independent Special Counsel responsible for investigating and prosecuting prohibited personnel practices, employment discrimination, unlawful political activities, arbitrary withholding of information requested under the Freedom of Information Act, and any other violations of law within the federal civil service. <em>See </em>sections 1204 &amp; 1206.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-20\">As detailed in Title II, the Board\u2019s principal duty is to mediate the recurring conflict between the two most important goals of the CSRA: protection of employee rights and enhancement of government efficiency. There are essentially two ways in which such controversies may reach the Board: The first is through \u201cChapter 77\u201d appeals<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> brought by individual employees complain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>ing of adverse agency personnel actions.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The Board\u2019s role as the final administrative arbiter of such complaints is inherited from the Civil Service Commission. Secondly, section 1206(c)(1)(B) of the Act authorizes the Special Counsel to petition the Board for \u201ccorrective action\u201d against agencies or employees engaged in prohibited personnel practices. Unlike appeals, corrective action proceedings have no counterpart in preCSRA law.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">Chapter 77 confers on federal employees a broad right to challenge personnel decisions before the Board. Section 7701(a) provides: \u201cAny employee, or applicant for employment, may submit an appeal to the Merit Systems Protection Board from any action which is appealable to the Board under any law, rule, or regulation.\u201d Actions explicitly deemed appealable include reductions in grade and removals based on unacceptable performance, section 4303(e), and enumerated \u201cadverse actions\u201d taken for other reasons.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Section 7513(d). Chapter 77 details the procedures governing appeals to the Board and contains provisions related to attorney\u2019s fees and judicial review.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">Section 1206, in contrast, elaborates the \u201ccorrective action\u201d authority of the Special Counsel without reference to the appeal rights of individual employees. The Act instructs the Special Counsel to \u201creceive any allegation of a prohibited personnel practice and [to] investigate the allegations to the extent necessary to determine whether there are reasonable grounds to believe that a prohibited personnel practice has occurred, exists, or is to be taken.\u201d Section 1206(a)(1). If the focus of the allegations concerns whistleblowing, the Special Counsel must convey the substance of the whistle-blower\u2019s claims to the relevant agency but may not disclose the identity of the complaining employee without the latter\u2019s consent. Sections 1206(b)(1) &amp; (2).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b239-12\">The Special Counsel\u2019s initial investigation may reveal, in addition to alleged wrongdoing within the responsibility of other authorities, evidence of prohibited personnel practices correctable by the Board. In that event, the Special Counsel must first seek an accommodation with the agency involved; if that effort fails, the Special Counsel may request a corrective order by the Board. Specifically, section 1206(c)(1) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-13\">(A) If, in connection with any investigation under this section, the Special Counsel determines that there are reasonable grounds to believe that a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>prohibited personnel practice has occurred, exists, or is to be taken which requires corrective action, the Special Counsel shall report the determination together with any findings or recommendations to the Board, the agency involved, and to the [OPM], and may report the determination, findings, and recommendations to the President. The Special Counsel may include in the report recommendations as to what corrective action should be taken.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-4\">(B) If, after a reasonable period, the agency has not taken the corrective action recommended, the Special Counsel may request the Board to consider the matter. The Board may order such corrective action as the Board considers appropriate, after opportunity for comment by the agency concerned and the [OPM].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ag4\">Section 1208 permits the Special Counsel to request, and the Board to grant, stays of personnel actions the Special Counsel reasonably believes are grounded in prohibited practices.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">B. <em>Proceedings before the Board.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">1. <em>The Special Counsel\u2019s petition. </em>In early 1979, the Special Counsel received allegations that four Deputy U.S. Marshals assigned to the Northern District of Georgia were about to be transferred to other districts in retaliation for engaging in activities protected by the Act. In the course of an investigation, the Special Counsel determined that there were reasonable grounds to support the claims and therefore asked the Board to stay the transfers pursuant to section 1208. The Board granted the request as well as a subsequent petition for extension of the stay.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> As of the time of the Board\u2019s decision under review, the transfers had not taken place.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-7\">On completion of the investigation, the Special Counsel filed a report with the Board, the Office of Personnel Management, and the Department of Justice (of which the Marshals Service is a part) pursuant to section 1206(c)(1)(A). The report concluded that there was evidence to support the deputies\u2019 claims that their transfers were ordered in reprisal for protected activities. Specifically, the report determined that the four deputies had all filed several equal employment opportunity complaints, an \u201cappeal right\u201d within section 2302(b)(9), and that they had complained about the management of the Marshals Service to two United States Congressmen, a form of disclosure protected by the whistle-blowing provisions of section 2302(b)(8)(A). The Special Counsel concluded that these activities may have formed the basis for the transfer orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-11\">In a letter accompanying the report, the Special Counsel recommended, among other things, that the Attorney General rescind the transfers. The Attorney General declined, asserting that the Marshals Service had not engaged in retaliation but had instead reassigned the deputies for the sound management purpose of relieving irreconcilable personality conflicts in the Atlanta Marshals office. When several efforts to resolve the matter informally failed, the Special Counsel filed a petition for corrective action with the Board, citing section 1206(c)(1)(B). The petition repeated the charges contained in the earlier report and asked the Board to enforce the recommendation that the transfers be rescinded.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-12\">2. <em>Prehearing developments. </em>Shortly after responsive pleadings were filed, the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE) moved to intervene in the proceeding. By order of July 12, 1979, the Board treated the AFGE pleading as a motion by AFGE attorneys \u201cto appear on behalf of the petitioners\u201d and granted it. I J.A. 237. On the same day, the Board issued a pretrial order governing discovery and set the matter \u201cfor a trial on the merits before the Board.\u201d I J.A. 239-40. This was followed by an order permitting the deputies \u201cfully [to] participate in this proceeding as any other party.\u201d I J.A. 250.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>Both the AFGE attorneys and the Special Counsel objected to the Board\u2019s decision to hold an evidentiary hearing. The Board overruled the objections and conducted four days of hearings. Over further objection by the complaining parties, the Board assigned the burden of proof to the Special Counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">3. <em>The factual background. </em>The Board\u2019s final decision<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> set forth extensive findings of fact. Those relevant here may be briefly summarized: The Atlanta office of the U.S. Marshals Service had apparently experienced morale problems for some time prior to the appointment of Marshal Ronald Angel in September 1977. The Board found, for example, that the Northern District \u201cwas the source of an unusually large number of complaints charging equal employment opportunity (EEO) violations.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> In particular, all four petitioners in this case had been involved to varying degrees in the presentation of EEO grievances throughout 1977 and 1978. In the late spring of 1978, a group of deputies that, at various times, included all four petitioners, brought complaints about the management of the district to two U.S. Congressmen. The Board found that, in general, the deputies alleged \u201charassment and racial discrimination against blacks; incompetent supervisors; problems in the transportation of prisoners\u201d and improprieties at an office training session and barbeque held earlier that spring at a local pistol range.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The deputies provided the Congressmen and their staffs with documents purporting to support their claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">Efforts by one of the Congressmen\u2019s aides to pursue the complaints came to the attention of Frank Vandergrift, Chief of General Operations for the Marshals Service. After making some inquiries in Atlanta, Vandergrift referred the matter to Ray Lora, Acting Special Assistant for EEO Affairs, and reixirted his visit and the referral to the Deputy Director of the Service. On July 16, 1978, Lora arrived in Atlanta and began an investigation that included meetings with Marshal Angel, the petitioners, other members of the Northern District staff and the congressional aide who had prompted the investigation. Immediately after Lora\u2019s visit, Marshal Angel wrote to Marshals Service Director William Hall, recommending the transfer of three of the petitioners in this case (Frazier, Morris, and Reilly) as well as a fourth deputy. On his return from Atlanta, Lora discussed his investigation with Hall \u201cin terms of management problems in the Northern District and the polarization of staff there\u201d and told Hall he agreed with Angel\u2019s transfer recommendations.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b241-13\">Hall did not act on the recommendation at that time. In the ensuing months, however, he received reports of continuing difficulties in the Atlanta office. In late December 1978, Marshal Angel visited Service headquarters in Washington to discuss the problems. Following that visit, Hall appointed a management review team \u201cto investigate all facets of the Atlanta office\u2019s operation and to make any recommendation that would rectify the problems in that office.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The team\u2019s investigation lasted several days and, in January 1979, the team issued a report to Hall that, among other things, recommended the transfer of petitioners Frazier, Morris, Reilly, and Love.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> On January 29, 1978, Director Hall ordered all four transferred to different Marshals offices throughout the country.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-14\">4. <em>The Board\u2019s conclusions. </em>The Board determined that the deputies\u2019 disclosures to the two Congressmen were protected by the whistleblowing provisions of the CSRA.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>The Board further concluded that, to support a finding of prohibited personnel practices, the Special Counsel must show \u201cthat the official accused of taking the retaliatory action against the whistleblower had knowledge that the protected disclosure had been made and by whom.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Accordingly, the Board next considered whether Director Hall had \u201cactual or constructive knowledge\u201d of the visits by the deputies to the two congressional offices.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> The Board determined that while Marshal Angel, Chief of Operations Vandergrift, and Special Assistant Lora may have known about the whistleblowing, none of the three had identified the complaining deputies to Hall. The Board credited Hall\u2019s testimony that, while he knew there had been congressional contacts, \u201che did not know at the time he ordered the transfers who [the whistleblowing] deputies were, and ... he did not consider the congressional contacts in reaching the decision.\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Rather, the Board decided, Hall relied entirely on the recommendations of the management review team. Moreover, the Board concluded, the team members \u201cdid not know that the four deputies whose transfers they recommended had made disclosures\u201d to the Congressmen.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b242-4\">The Board also decided that the transfers of Morris, Reilly, and Love had not been ordered in reprisal for their EEO activities. The Board found \u201cno persuasive evidence\u201d that either the review team or Hall were aware of any such activities by Reilly and Love.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> With respect to Morris, the Board did find that two team members and Director Hall knew about his EEO complaint but concluded nevertheless that the complaint had not been considered in the decision to transfer him.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> The Board thus upheld the transfers of Reilly, Love, and Morris.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-15\">The Board decided that Frazier\u2019s more frequent and extensive EEO activities \u201cwere known to and considered by the management review team in recommending his transfer.\u201d<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> The Board attributed to Hall the retaliatory intent against Frazier that it found in the management of the Atlanta office</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-16\">because of its widespread nature and because of the repeated direct involvement of headquarters in Frazier\u2019s EEO matters. From this, the Board' infers that Mr. Hall was at least a silent participant in retaliation against Frazier.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"Att\">Accordingly, the Board directed the Marshals Service to rescind Frazier\u2019s transfer and to cease retaliating against him for his EEO activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-17\">II. THRESHOLD ISSUES.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-18\">A. <em>Appealability.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b242-19\">Section 7703 of the CSRA, together with 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2342 (Supp. III 1979),<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> gives the court of appeals exclusive jurisdic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>tion to review a final order of the MSPB on petition of \u201c[a]ny employee or applicant for employment adversely affected or aggrieved\u201d<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> by a Board decision. For reasons explained in Part B below, we are satisfied that three of the petitioners remain \u201cadversely affected\u201d by the order sustaining their transfers.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> The Board nevertheless suggests that the placement of section 7703 in the chapter of the Act concerned with the Board\u2019s appellate authority, <em>see </em>p. 155 <em>supra, </em>prevents its application to other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>chapters in the Act, including those governing corrective action petitions brought by the Special Counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-4\">We reject the Board\u2019s argument. While section 7703 does appear in Chapter 77, which concerns employee appeals to the Board, its language broadly encompasses any \u201cfinal order or decision\u201d of the Board. Similarly, Title 28\u2019s grant of jurisdiction to the court of appeals, enacted along with the CSRA, covers \u201call final orders of the Merit Systems Protection Board.\u201d Nothing in these provisions limits their applicability to those final orders arising out of Chapter 77 appeals. Nor does the fact that the phrase \u201cfinal order or decision\u201d appears under a heading concerned with a particular type of proceeding narrow the plain meaning of the words. <em>Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen v. Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railroad Co., </em>331 U.S. 519, 527-29, 67 S.Ct. 1387, 1391-92, 91 L.Ed. 1646 (1947).</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">The legislative history of section 7703 makes clear that it was meant to have the broad reach indicated by its language. In discussing the original version of the section, the report of the Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs specifically referred to its use \u201cunder any other sections\u201d of the statute.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> Moreover, the report cited section 1205(a)(2), the provision governing Special Counsel petitions for stays, as an illustration of one of the \u201cother sections\u201d to which section 7703 applies.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> Since the stay provision appears in the same part of the Act under which the instant case was brought, its use as an example in the report provides strong support for our conclusion that section 7703 properly applies to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-10\">B. <em>Mootness.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b244-11\">The Board contends that Frazier, whose transfer was set aside, obtained the remedy he sought and that his petition should therefore be dismissed as moot. In addition, the Board states that all four of the petitioners in this case left the Marshals Service either shortly before or some time after the Board\u2019s decision was announced.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> Since neither the court nor the Board can order the Service to reassign individuals no longer in its employ, the Board argues, petitioners\u2019 request for review of the Board\u2019s decision fails to present a \u201ccase or controversy\u201d as required by Article III of the Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-12\">1. <em>Frazier. </em>In his petition on the merits, Frazier attacks a Board decision that granted him all the relief he requested. The Board agreed with Frazier that his transfer had been improperly based on the exercise of protected EEO appeal rights and therefore ordered the reassignment rescinded.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> Frazier nevertheless asserts that \u201che is still ... \u2018chilled\u2019 by the Board\u2019s erroneous decision regarding\u201d his whistleblowing activities. Reply Brief for Frazier at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>4-5. The Board did not, however, attempt to limit such activities in any way. It merely concluded that Frazier\u2019s disclosures to Congressmen, which he remains free to continue, did not result in his transfer. Even if we determined that the Board\u2019s decision on this point was incorrect, Frazier would be entitled to no more relief than he has already received. Under these circumstances, Frazier presents us with no continuing controversy and we will therefore dismiss his petition in No. 80-1067.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">2. <em>Morris, Reilly, and Love. </em>While the Board sustained the reassignments of the other three deputies, respondents correctly point out that the departure of the three from the Service has rendered mere rescission of the transfers a meaningless remedy. The fact that subsequent events have made the originally requested form of relief inappropriate, however, does not mean that the Board\u2019s decision lacks any continuing effect on petitioners. The personnel actions sustained by the Board were explicitly based on negative characterizations of the personalities and work attitudes of the deputies.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> These official comments, which the Board deemed justified,<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> presumably remain on the deputies\u2019 records and may affect their future employment prospects, both in and outside of government. Furthermore, if, as petitioners allege, the transfers wrongfully forced the deputies to resign, they may be entitled to reinstatement or monetary compensation.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> The Board\u2019s decision, if unreviewed, could pose a serious obstacle to the assertion of any such claims.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> Accordingly, we conclude \u201cthat the underlying adversariness of the parties before us, the existence of a controversy [before the Board] that was concrete, real and immediate, and the persistence of elements of that controversy in the continuing relations of the parties,\u201d establish that the case is not constitutionally moot.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> <em>Alton &amp; Southern Railway Co. v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number><em>International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, </em>463 F.2d 872, 877 (D.C.Cir.1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\">III. PROCEDURES GOVERNING CORRECTIVE ACTION CASES</p>\n<p id=\"A4L\">We turn, then, to the merits. The provisions of the CSRA governing corrective actions lack both the detail and the historical background of other sections of the Act. <em>See </em>p. 155 <em>supra. </em>Accordingly, we must begin by briefly exploring the purposes of this new type of proceeding. In that effort, we are guided not only by our usual policy of deferring to an agency\u2019s interpretation of its enabling act, but especially by the requirement that we pay heed to the \u201ccontemporaneous construction of a [new] statute by [those] charged with the responsibility of setting its machinery in motion, of making the parts work efficiently and smoothly while they are yet untried and new.\u201d<footnotemark>40</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">A. <em>Nature of the Proceeding.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">While petitioners seem to view the Special Counsel as both \u201cpublic defender\u201d for federal employees and the final judge of whistleblowing claims, the Board conceives the Special Counsel more as a prosecutor charged with vindicating the Act\u2019s goal of achieving a fair, efficient, and lawfully-conducted Civil Service. The Board thus draws a significant distinction between the purpose of a corrective action proceeding and that of a Chapter 77 appeal. While appeals concern personal employment disputes, the Board argues, the \u201cthrust [of corrective action petitions] is toward systemic, not individual problems in the federal merit sytem . . . . \u201d Brief for Respondents at 35, n.17.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-11\">The Board\u2019s analysis of the Special Counsel\u2019s role is supported by the language and legislative history of the Act. It is evident on the face of the statute that the Special Counsel may seek to remedy prohibited practices that do not aggrieve any particular employee. <em>See </em>p. 154 <em>supra. </em>Moreover, even in cases initiated by a complaining employee, the Special Counsel can apparently make compromises with the agency involved, seek corrective action short of that requested by the complainant, and, we assume, refuse to pursue the case at all.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> Quite clearly, then, the duties of the Special Counsel are not equivalent to those of an employees\u2019 advocate.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-12\">Rather, the authors of the CSRA apparently expected the Special Counsel to act as an ombudsman responsible for investigating and prosecuting violations of the Act.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> The Special Counsel was modeled after the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>General Counsel of the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) who performs an independent prosecutorial role with respect to employment relations in the private sector.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> Furthermore, the reports and debates concerning the CSRA are replete with characterizations of the Special Counsel as a \u201cprosecutor\u201d or \u201cwatchdog\u201d of merit system abuses.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> In short, if Chapter 77 appeals can be analogized to civil proceedings in which the immediate interests are personal to the litigants, corrective action petitions are comparable to criminal prosecutions designed to vindicate the <em>public </em>interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">On this view of the Act, the principal recourse for individual employees who have suffered cognizable injury from a personnel action is to a Chapter 77 appeal \u2014 and not to the office of Special Counsel. <em>But see </em>note 41 <em>supra. </em>There will, of course, be many instances in which the interests of the Special Counsel and of a particular employee converge. An individual improperly discharged for whistleblowing, for example, could presumably seek the assistance of the Special Counsel in a Chapter 77 appeal<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> or forego that route entirely and rely on the Special Counsel to remedy the separation through a corrective action petition. Moreover, the Board may possess authority to merge corrective action and Chapter 77 appeals when they arise from the same set of facts.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> Even in situations like those posited, however, the roles of the individual employee and the Special Counsel may differ. While the former seeks personal restoration, the latter is fundamentally concerned with the integrity of the merit system. As the Senate Report explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-12\">The Special Counsel should not passively await employee complaints, but rather, vigorously pursue merit system abuses on a systematic basis. He should seek action by the Merit Board to eliminate both individual instances of merit abuse and patterns of prohibited personnel practices.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b247-13\">B. <em>The Evidentiary Hearing.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b247-14\">Having established the nature of the new corrective action proceeding and the role of the Special Counsel, we can now consider petitioners\u2019 various challenges to the procedures employed by the Board. Petitioners\u2019 first claim is that the Board exceeded its authority in conducting an evidentiary hearing on the facts underlying the deputies\u2019 allegations. Instead, they argue, the Board was bound by the legal and factual conclusions of the Special Counsel and was limited to determining the appropriate remedy. In response, the Board contends that the authority of the Special Counsel extends only to investigation and prosecution and that all adjudicatory power is lodged in the Board itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-15\">We agree with the Board. As outlined above, the language and history of the Act consistently describe the Special Counsel in terms that suggest a prosecutor rather than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>a judge. The same sources clearly assign adjudicatory functions to the Board. Section 1205(a)(1) of the Act, for instance, grants the Board comprehensive power to hear and adjudicate all matters within its purview.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> With respect to petitions brought by the Special Counsel, section 1208 gives the Board final authority to issue stays and section 1207 requires the Board to conduct a hearing when the Special Counsel\u2019s complaint is directed at an individual. <em>See </em>note 42 <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b248-4\">Moreover, the corrective action section itself is cast in terms that evoke a prosecutor-judge relationship between the Special Counsel and the Board. When the Special Counsel finds <em>\u201creasonable grounds </em>to believe that a prohibited personnel practice has occurred, exists, or is to be taken,\u201d he or she \u201cmay <em>request\u201d </em>action by the Board. Section 1206(c)(1)(A) &amp; (B) (emphasis added). The Board correctly points out that these phrases are typically employed in defining the standard for bringing an enforcement action.<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> Together with the constant references in the legislative history to the Board\u2019s \u201cquasi-judicial\u201d role,<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> the Act\u2019s language undermines petitioners\u2019 argument that the Special Counsel\u2019s determinations are binding on the Board.<footnotemark>51</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b248-10\">In light of its broad responsibility to adjudicate merit system disputes, the Board certainly has authority to conduct evidentiary hearings in appropriate cases. As previously noted, section 1205(a)(1) allows the Board to \u201chear, adjudicate, or provide for the hearing or adjudication, of all matters within [its] jurisdiction . .. . \u201d While the corrective action sections do not <em>require </em>a hearing when the respondent is an agency rather than an individual,<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> we have often emphasized that agencies may \u201cadopt procedures beyond the minima explicitly prescribed by statute.\u201d <em>FTC v. Brigadier Industries Corp., </em>613 F.2d 1110, 1115 (D.C.Cir.1979). <em>See also Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Corp. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., </em>435 U.S. 519, 524, 98 S.Ct. 1197, 1202, 55 L.Ed.2d 460 (1978); <em>O\u2019Donnell v. Shaffer, </em>491 F.2d 59, 62 (D.C.Cir.1974). In light of the serious factual disputes and credibility issues raised by the Special Counsel\u2019s petition, we believe the Board acted reasonably in ordering a hearing in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-11\">C. <em>Burden of Proof.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b248-12\">Petitioners next contend that the Board erred in requiring the Special Counsel to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>prove the existence of prohibited personnel practices by the preponderance of the evidence. Asserting that the Board must at least give the determinations of the Special Counsel \u201cgreat deference,\u201d the deputies argue that the filing of a corrective action petition makes out a prima facie case which the charged agency must rebut by clear and convincing evidence. Respondents counter that the Board\u2019s allocation of the burden of proof is supported by other provisions of the Act and by the case law in analogous areas.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">As section 1206 is silent on the question of which party bears the burden of proof, we must sustain the Board\u2019s choice if it is consistent with the statutory scheme and reasonable. <em>See FCC v. Schreiber, </em>381 U.S. 279, 290-94, 85 S.Ct. 1459, 1467-69, 14 L.Ed.2d 383 (1965). We believe the Board\u2019s analysis satisfies these criteria. In Chapter 77 appeals, an agency seeking to take a challenged personnel action bears the burden of showing that its decision is justified by concerns for the efficiency of the civil service. <em>See </em>section 7701(c)(1). Yet the employee, and not the agency, apparently bears the burden of proving allegations of prohibited personnel practices. <em>See </em>section 7701(c)(2)(B).<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> These provisions may reflect a congressional assumption that agency reprisals are relatively exceptional<footnotemark>54</footnotemark> and that official regularity in this regard should be presumed. <em>See Mazaleski v. Treusdell, </em>562 F.2d 701, 717 n.38 (D.C.Cir.1977). The Board could reasonably conclude that, especially in light of the prosecutorial nature of the proceeding, <em>see </em>p. 162 <em>supra, </em>the same principle should apply in a corrective action case.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-12\">Requiring the Special Counsel to demonstrate that an agency\u2019s action was improperly based on retaliatory motives is also consistent with the rule in other employment contexts. A public employee claiming a violation of the first amendment, for instance, must prove that protected activities constituted a substantial cause of a disciplinary action. <em>Mount Healthy City School District v. Doyle, </em>429 U.S. 274, 287, 97 S.Ct. 568, 576, 50 L.Ed.2d 471 (1977).<footnotemark>55</footnotemark> Similarly, both the General Counsel of the NLRB and employees asserting rights under the Civil Rights Act bear the burden of demonstrating prohibited reprisal motives in discharge cases. <em>Texas Dept. of Community Affairs v. Burdine, </em>450 U.S. 248, 253, 101 S.Ct. 1089, 1094, 67 L.Ed.2d 207 (1981) (civil rights); <em>Womack v. Munson, </em>619 F.2d 1292, 1296 (8th Cir. 1980), <em>cert. denied, </em>450 U.S. 979, 101 S.Ct. 1513, 67 L.Ed.2d 814 (1981) (civil rights); <em>Abilene Sheet Metal, Inc. v. NLRB, </em>619 F.2d 332, 339 (5th Cir. 1980); <em>District 65, Distributive Workers of America v. NLRB, </em>593 F.2d 1155, 1165 (D.C.Cir.1978). <em>See also Wilson v. Thompson, </em>593 F.2d 1375, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>1384-87 (5th Cir. 1979) (allegations of prosecution brought in retaliation for first amendment activities).</p>\n<p id=\"b250-4\">D. <em>Elements of a Reprisal Case.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">As noted above, p. 157 <em>supra, </em>the Board decided that, in order to demonstrate the existence of prohibited personnel practices, the Special Counsel must prove \u201cthat the official accused of taking the retaliatory action against the whistleblower had knowledge that the protected disclosure had been made and by whom.\u201d Petitioners agree with the Board that official knowledge of protected activities constitutes an essential element of a reprisal finding. They read the Board\u2019s opinion, however, as requiring a showing of direct, personal knowledge by the final agency decisionmaker. Such a requirement, petitioners argue, conflicts with the purpose of the whistleblower provisions of the CSRA by permitting prohibited retaliations to be insulated by layers of bureaucratic \u201cignorance.\u201d Moreover, petitioners claim, the Board\u2019s imposition of an actual knowledge requirement with respect to the disclosures is inconsistent with the Board\u2019s treatment of the EEO-related claims.<footnotemark>56</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">There can be no doubt that a rule limiting retaliation findings to situations in which the top agency official has actual knowledge of the protected activities would seriously undercut the CSRA\u2019s goal of strengthening management accountability. Section 2302(c), for instance, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-7\">The head of each agency shall be responsible for the prevention of prohibited personnel practices, for the compliance with and enforcement of applicable civil service laws, rules, and regulations, and other aspects of personnel management. Any individual to whom the head of an agency delegates authority for personnel management, or for any aspect thereof, shall be similarly responsible within the limits of the delegation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b250-10\">In elaborating on this provision, the Senate Report explained, \u201cto the extent that managerial or supervisory authority is delegated, this section means that responsibility for insuring compliance with the merit system, and potential disciplinary liability for failing to ensure compliance, will follow such a delegation.\u201d <footnotemark>57</footnotemark> The report continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-11\">The delegation will not, however, relieve the head of the executive agency or other top officials for ultimate responsibility for personnel actions and policies within the agency, to the extent that such officials have knowledge <em>or should have knowledge </em>of the actions taken or policies implemented. (Emphasis added.) <footnotemark>58</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b250-12\">Thus, the statute imposes on agency heads an affirmative obligation to prevent prohibited practices of which they are or should be aware. We agree with petitioners, therefore, that <em>constructive </em>knowledge of protected activities on the part of one with ultimate responsibility for a personnel action may support an inference of retaliatory intent. Moreover, while delegation of authority does not relieve an agency head of responsibility, subordinates with power to effect a personnel action may also be called to account. Thus, section 2302(b) expressly prohibits \u201c[a]ny employee who has authority to take, direct others to take, recommend, or approve any personnel action\u201d from taking such an action for prohibited reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-13\">While the Board\u2019s opinion could have been clearer, we believe it adequately conformed to these principles. With respect to the agency head, the Board was explicit:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>We are compelled by the record here to conclude that Director Hall did not have actual or constructive knowledge that these deputies had engaged in protected activities. Rather, he acted in full reliance upon the recommendation of the management review team which ... was for the most part based upon sound management considerations.<footnotemark>59</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"Are\">In support of these conclusions, the Board detailed the evidence showing Hall\u2019s lack of actual knowledge and noted the absence of evidence to the contrary.<footnotemark>60</footnotemark> The Board then considered the Special Counsel\u2019s argument that knowledge of the disclosures by the management review team should be attributed to Hall.<footnotemark>61</footnotemark> On review of the evidence, the Board rejected the factual predicate of the argument, crediting the uniform testimony of the team\u2019s members \u201cthat they did not know that the four deputies whose transfers they recommended had made disclosures\u201d to the congressmen.<footnotemark>62</footnotemark> Finally, the Board found no basis for application of the \u201csmall plant\u201d doctrine, a labor law rule attributing knowledge of protected activities to employers of relatively small labor forces.<footnotemark>63</footnotemark> Although the Board occasionally employed the phrase \u201cactual knowledge\u201d in its treatment of these points, its analysis implicitly acknowledged the possibility that a finding of retaliation could be based on constructive knowledge as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">The Board also recognized that retaliatory intent on the part of Hall\u2019s subordinates, even if not attributable to the Director, could form the basis of a prohibited practice to the extent that they contributed to the decision to take the personnel actions. The only individuals whose views might have lead to the transfer orders and who knew about the whistleblowing were three officials of the Marshals Service: Angel, Lora, and Vandergrift. <em>See </em>p. 157 <em>supra. </em>The evidence did not indicate that either Vandergrift or Lora had played any role in the decision to transfer the deputies.<footnotemark>64</footnotemark> While Angel did seek the reassignment of three of the petitioners, the Board determined that his suggestion played no part in the ultimate decision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-12\">[Ajssuming that Marshal Angel had the requisite knowledge and acted with retaliatory intent in recommending the transfers of Deputies Frazier, Reilly, Morris, and Jordan, that recommendation was a nullity since Hall did not act on it. Instead, Hall ordered the transfers of Chief Deputy Bowler and Deputies Love, Reilly, Morris, and Frazier, acting in reliance upon the recommendations of the management review team.<footnotemark>65</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b251-13\">In sum, the Special Counsel alleged that officials of the Marshals Service recommended or ordered personnel actions in retaliation for protected activities. The Board properly assumed that such a claim presupposes that individuals with actual or constructive knowledge of the activities <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>helped cause the personnel actions. Fairly read, the Board\u2019s opinion determined that, in this case, those who effected the transfers had no knowledge and those with knowledge had no effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-4\">E. <em>Attorney\u2019s Fees.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">Frazier, whose transfer was rescinded by the Board, challenges the Board\u2019s refusal to award him attorney\u2019s fees. The Board concluded that the authority to award fees granted by section 7701(g) of the Act does not extend to corrective action proceedings. Relying on the language, placement, and history of the section, the Board decided that its power to grant fees was limited to Chapter 77 appeal cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">We begin by noting that monetary liability may not be imposed against a federal agency unless Congress has clearly waived sovereign immunity. <em>Alyeska Pipeline Service Co. v. Wilderness Society, </em>421 U.S. 240, 267-68, 95 S.Ct. 1612, 1626-27, 44 L.Ed.2d 141 (1975); <em>N.A.A.C.P. v. Civiletti, </em>609 F.2d 514, 516 (D.C.Cir.1979), <em>cert. denied sub nom. Andrulis v. U. S., </em>447 U.S. 922, 100 S.Ct. 3012, 65 L.Ed.2d 1114 (1980). We must decide, therefore, whether such a waiver can be found in the express language of section 7701(g) or by \u201cnecessary implication from the statutory context in which [the] fee provision arises.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 516-17.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-7\">1. <em>Statutory language. </em>As relevant, section 7701(g) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-8\"><em>[T]he Board, or an administrative law judge or other employee of the Board designated to hear a case, </em>may require payment by the agency involved of reasonable attorney\u2019s fees incurred by an employee or applicant for employment if the employee or applicant for employment is the <em>prevailing party </em>and the Board, administrative law judge, or other employee, as the case may be, determines that payment by the agency is warranted in the interests of justice, <em>including any case in which a prohibited personnel practice was engaged in by the agency </em>or any case in which the agency\u2019s action was clearly without merit. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b252-9\">The section is not expressly limited to appeals brought under Chapter 77. Indeed, it extends to \u201cany case\u201d and explicitly includes those, like the present one, that involve prohibited personnel practices.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-10\">The Board nevertheless relies on the emphasized phrases to argue that \u201cthe provision\u2019s language clearly presupposes the existence of . .. an appeal.\u201d Brief for MSPB at 14. We find the Board\u2019s reading strained. First, the Board notes that the beginning of the section refers to the decisionmakers assigned by the Act to Chapter 77 appeals. <em>See </em>section 7701(b). Yet section 1205, on whose broad grant of procedural discretion the Board depends in another context, <em>see </em>p. 164 <em>supra, </em>specifically permits the Board to delegate the hearing of <em>\u201call </em>matters within [its] jurisdiction\u201d to the same decisionmakers.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-11\">Second, the Board contends that the phrase \u201chear a case\u201d limits the operation of the section to those proceedings in which the Act expressly provides for a hearing. This argument stands somewhat uncomfortably beside the Board\u2019s insistence that it had the power \u2014 perhaps even the duty \u2014 to conduct a hearing in this case. <em>See </em>p. 164 <em>supra. </em>In any event, the provision is not, by its terms restricted to cases which <em>must </em>include a formal hearing. Rather, the language easily covers any case the Board <em>chooses </em>to hear.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-12\">Third, the Board suggests that an employee can only be a \u201cprevailing party\u201d within the language of the section when he or she appeals as of right under Chapter 77. In this very case, however, the Board permitted the deputies, through their attorneys, \u201cfully [to] participate in this proceeding as any other party.\u201d The Board thus implicitly recognized that intervenors can have the status of parties. The rights conferred by that status may include the right to request attorney\u2019s fees. <em>Cf. United States v. Board of Education of Waterbury, Connecticut, </em>605 F.2d 573, 576 (2d Cir. 1979) (finding authority to award fees to district court intervenor).</p>\n<p id=\"b253-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>Finally, the Board asserts that the last clause of the fee provision \u201cwhich gives examples of when an award is \u2018warranted in the interest of justice,\u2019 refers to specified kinds of appeal eases, as the introductory word \u2018including\u2019 indicates.\u201d Answering Brief for MSPB at 3. While \u201cincluding\u201d certainly suggests an example, the phrase \u201cany case\u201d hardly seems restricted to appeals. The instant proceeding was manifestly a \u201ccase in which a prohibited personnel practice was engaged in by the agency,\u201d as the Board itself determined.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">In short, we are unconvinced by the Board\u2019s effort to import unusual meaning into the words of the section. The phrases \u201chear a case\u201d and \u201cprevailing party\u201d are not, as this case demonstrates, restricted in common usage to the type of action contemplated by Chapter 77. And the reference to \u201cany case\u201d involving prohibited practices plainly extends to all proceedings in which action is sought to identify and correct such practices. Read naturally, the language of the provision clearly waives sovereign immunity with respect to any case in which an employee or applicant for employment appears as a party.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">2. <em>Legislative intent. </em>The Board suggests that, however broad the language of section 7701(g) may be, there are independent indications that Congress intended to limit the operation of the provision to Chapter 77 appeals. Specifically, the Board points to the fact that the fees provision is part of a section entitled \u201cAppellate procedures\u201d which in turn appears in Chapter 77. Furthermore, the Board notes, references to fees in the legislative history occasionally speak of appeals but never mention corrective action cases. For reasons just detailed, the Board\u2019s parsing of the section fails to disclose the kinds of linguistic ambiguities that require resort to interpretive aids like placement and history. We believe, nevertheless, that the Board\u2019s contentions reflect an unduly narrow understanding of the statutory scheme. Accordingly, we will discuss them briefly.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-8\">We may assume, from the section\u2019s placement and from various references in the legislative history to appeals, that Congress expected the fees provision to operate chiefly in the context of Chapter 77 actions. That fact alone, however, does not demonstrate that Congress intended to limit its waiver of immunity to such cases. At least two views of the legislative intent are plausible. Congress may, as the Board suggests, have assumed that the presence of the Special Counsel and the nature of corrective action proceedings make fee awards in such cases unnecessary or unwise. Alternatively, Congress may have allowed awards in <em>all </em>cases in which employees participate as parties. In that case, references in the history to appeals may simply reflect the fact that the possibility of such participation in corrective action proceedings was not immediately apparent to Congress.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-9\">We believe the latter hypothesis is more consistent with the available evidence. The purpose of the fees provision was set forth in the Senate Report at length:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b253-10\">The Civil Service Commission currently does not have the authority to require agencies to pay the attorney fees of employees who prevail in their appeals. Employees whose agencies have taken unfounded actions against them may spend a considerable amount of money defending themselves against these actions [yet] they cannot be reimbursed for attorney fees upon prevailing in their appeals to the Commission. Instead, they must file civil actions against the Government in order to obtain a review of their requests for reimbursement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b253-11\">The legislation remedies this problem by authorizing the Board members and hearing officials to require payment, by agencies which are losing parties to proceedings before the Board, of attorney fees to the employees who prevailed. . . ,<footnotemark>66</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b254-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>As expressed in this passage, the policy underlying the fees provision, while stated with reference to appeals, seems applicable to any proceeding in which an aggrieved employee seeks to vindicate rights conferred by the Act. As the Board may have recognized when it allowed the deputies to appear through their own lawyers, an employee can have a strong interest in challenging \u201cagencies [that] have taken unfounded actions against them\u201d even when those actions can only be remedied through a corrective action petition. Nor is that interest necessarily protected by the Special Counsel, whose efforts to assure a properly managed civil service may conflict with the goals of individual employees. <em>See </em>pp. 162 to 163 <em>supra. </em>Indeed, given the negotiating process that precedes the filing of a petition, the Special Counsel may commonly take a position before the Board that is somewhere between that of the employer and the employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-4\">Thus, it seems doubtful that Congress concluded that separate representation, and thereby fee authority, would be unnecessary in corrective action proceedings. Instead, Congress seems to have conferred authority to award fees in all cases in which employees appear as parties and permitted the Board to decide whether such appearances and fees were appropriate in corrective action proceedings. As noted earlier, p. 155 <em>supra, </em>corrective action petitions, unlike appeals, did not exist prior to the enactment of the CSRA. Congress was quite familiar with the experience of the Civil Service Commission in treating appeals and, in an effort to improve that process, elaborated the procedures governing such cases in considerable detail. In contrast, the initial shaping of corrective action procedures was left to the Board; Congress authorized the proceeding in a few open-ended sentences. Those sentences gave the Board the discretion, which it exercised in this case, to employ many of the procedures associated with appeals and to conclude that the interests of the employees involved justified independent representation. <em>See </em>p. 157 <em>supra. </em>We are confident that that flexibility is also broad enough to permit\u2019 the Board to create a proceeding which by its nature would be within the intent of the waiver of sovereign immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">In sum, we hold the Board erred in determining that it lacked authority to assess attorney\u2019s fees in favor of the successful deputy. The language of section 7701(g) of the Act plainly waives sovereign immunity in any case in which an employee or applicant for employment appears as a party. Moreover, while the placement and history of the provision indicate that Congress did not expect fees questions to arise in corrective action proceedings, the intent of section 7701(g) together with the statutory scheme clearly give the Board the flexibility to award fees in appropriate corrective action cases. By permitting the deputies to appear through their own lawyers, the Board raised the possibility that this was such a case.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-7\">Our conclusion does not, of course, require the Board to award fees to petitioner Frazier. The Board must decide, in the first instance, whether the role employees play in the kind of proceeding it has established here implicates the policy underlying the fees provision. If so, the Board should consider whether Frazier can be called a \u201cprevailing party\u201d in light of his victory on the EEO wing of the case and whether \u201cpayment by the agency is warranted in the interest of justice.\u201d In examining the value of employee participation in corrective action proceedings, both in general and in the particular case, the Board may take into account the presence and role of the Special Counsel. We decide only that Congress has granted the Board power to award fees in all cases within its jurisdiction in which complaining employees appear as parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-8\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b254-9\">For the foregoing reasons, No. 80-1067 is dismissed as moot with respect to Frazier and affirmed as to the other three deputies.

Intervenors note that all four deputies have departed from the Marshals Service, see p. 160 <em>infra, </em>and therefore no longer possess the status of \u201cemployees\u201d or \u201capplicants for employment\u201d as required by section 7703. Intervenors acknowledge that discharged employees retain a right to contest a removal even after it has taken effect. They claim, however, that petitioners voluntarily resigned from the Service and therefore freely relinquished their \u201cemployee\u201d status. Petitioners strenuously deny that they left voluntarily. Instead, they allege that the transfers, put into final effect by the Board\u2019s decision, see <em>In re Frazier, </em>1 MSPB 268 (1979) (denying petition for stay pending appeal to this court), forced them to resign to avoid an intolerable disruption of their lives and working conditions. They thus contend that they were constructively discharged as a result of the Board\u2019s decision. <em>Cf. Alicea Rosado v. Garcia Santiago, </em>562 F.2d 114, 119 (1st Cir. 1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">We are not, of course, competent to determine the ultimate validity of petitioners\u2019 constructive discharge claims in the present posture of the case. We note, however, that an illegal reassignment, if it produces sufficient hardship and causes an unwilling resignation, can support such a claim. <em>See Roskos v. United States, </em>549 F.2d 1386 (Ct. Claims 1977) (improper or arbitrary transfer that would be hazardous to employee\u2019s health and hardship to his family represented coercive government action that directly produced resignation). In this case, petitioners, while still employees, argued that their transfers would be unlawful and would create undue hardships. The Board rejected these contentions, forcing the employees to choose between allegedly intolerable employment conditions and resignation. As in a conventional removal case, then, we are faced with a situation in which individuals contend that they are no longer employees precisely <em>because </em>of the decision they are challenging. Under these circumstances, we believe petitioners fall within the ambit of section 7703.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"30\">\n<p id=\"b243-8\">. \u201cAdversely affected\u201d for purposes of judicial review has no necessary relationship to \u201cadverse actions\u201d for purposes of bringing appeals to the Board. The latter phrase concerns an individual\u2019s right to attack personnel actions through the mechanism of a Chapter 77 appeal. <em>See </em>note 9 <em>supra. </em>In contrast, \u201cadversely affected,\u201d like similar standards used in other statutory review provisions, concerns the complainant\u2019s legal interest in challenging final orders of the Board. <em>See </em>Albert, <em>Standing to Challenge Administrative Action: An Inadequate Surrogate for Claim for </em>Relief, 83 Yale L.J. 425, 429-32 &amp; nn.11-12 (1974). The determination of interest sufficient to pursue an appeal is separate from consideration of the complainant\u2019s right to intervene in the proceedings below. See <em>Bryant v. Yellen, </em>447 U.S. 352, 366-67, 100 S.Ct. 2232, 2240-41, 65 L.Ed.2d 184 (1980); <em>Linda R. S. v.

This case does not, therefore, require us to determine whether a civil servant may demand intervention in a corrective action case that could affect his or her employment status.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-12\">Like other statutory review provisions, section 7703 invites an inquiry into the nature of complainant\u2019s alleged injury and the relationship of the injury to the purpose of the statute in question. <em>See, e.g., U. S. v. Storer Broadcasting Co., </em>351 U.S. 192, 198-200, 76 S.Ct. 763, 768-769, 100 L.Ed. 1081 (1956); <em>Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc. v. U.

In the absence of a specific review provision like section 7703, standing requirements may be even stricter. <em>See Wash. Utilities &amp; Transp. Comm\u2019n v. FCC, </em>513 F.2d 1142, 1149 n.8 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied sub nom. N.A.R.U.C. v. FCC, </em>423 U.S. 836, 96 S.Ct. 62, 46 L.Ed.2d 54 (1975). Without such a provision, the complainant must show that \u201cthe challenged action has caused him injury in fact, economic or otherwise\u201d and that the interest he seeks to protect falls \u201carguably within the zone of interests to be protected or regulated by the statute or constitutional guarantee in question.\u201d <em>Ass\u2019n of Data Processing Service Organizations, Inc. v.

In this case, petitioners Morris, Reilly, and Love easily satisfy even the arguably stricter <em>Data Processing </em>test. They have each alleged concrete and substantial injury from the Board\u2019s decision. <em>See </em>p. 161 <em>infra. </em>Moveover, their interest in retaining federal employment free from unlawful reprisals is clearly one within the \u201czone of interests to be protected\u201d by the CSRA. <em>See </em>pp. 153 to 154 <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"31\">\n<p id=\"b244-6\">.

Holecko\u2019s affidavit also states that Love and Reilly voluntarily resigned on January 2 and February 9, 1980, respectively. Finally, the affidavit states that Frazier did not report for duty from November 9, 1979 (after the Board had heard evidence and received the final pleadings but before it rendered its decision) until May 31, 1980, when he was removed from the Service for having abandoned his position. <em>See </em>Brief for Respondents in No. 80-1067, Appendix B.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"34\">\n<p id=\"b244-14\">. <em>See In re Frazier, </em>1 MSPB 193 (1979) (order of corrective action).

We do not know what effect the Board might give these findings in any subsequent action brought by the deputies to remedy the alleged discharges. We intimate no view on whether the Board could deem the findings conclusive in any future proceedings. The possibility that the Board\u2019s decision will have a substantial effect on any such proceedings is, however, a sufficient basis for concluding that the case is not moot. <em>See Sun Oil Co. of Penn. v.

Another indication that Congress intended the Board to evaluate the Special Counsel\u2019s determinations is found in the history of the provision granting the Special Counsel authority to seek stays of personnel actions. The Senate version required the Special Counsel to petition the Board for a stay while the House version allowed the Special Counsel to order a stay for up to 30 days without consultation with the Board. In conference, the Senate\u2019s approach was adopted because of a belief that \u201cthe Board, as a quasi-judicial body, is the appropriate authority to issue the stay.\u201d Conference Report at 133, U.S.Code Cong &amp; Admin.News 1978, p. 2866, <em>reprinted in </em>II Legislative History at 1975.

Thus an employee\u2019s claim to be a whistleblower must be carefully scrutinized to insure that whistle-blowing protection is not being misused in an attempt to thwart needed disciplinary action.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AiA\">1 MSPB at 159 n.1.
