The jury set appellant\u2019s sentence at fifty years and Goodman\u2019s at ninety-nine years. Spark-man\u2019s conviction was affirmed on direct appeal by the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, where he presented the same arguments which he now presents to this Court. <em>See Sparkman v. State, </em>580 S.W.2d 358 (Tex.Cr.App.1979). Sparkman thereafter filed applications for habeas corpus relief in the state courts which were summarily overruled. Appellant then filed for federal habeas relief alleging seven grounds of error. His application was referred to a U. S. Magistrate who recommended denial of relief without a hearing. The Magistrate\u2019s recommendations were adopted by the district court, and Sparkman now appeals.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b638-8\">Petitioner\u2019s only assertion on appeal is that he was denied due process of law by the introduction of testimony as to his reputation, at the punishment phase of the trial, from Texas Assistant Attorney General (now U. S. Magistrate), Calvin Botley, whose knowledge of Sparkman\u2019s reputation arose from his investigation of a prior conviction set aside, prior to this trial, for ineffective assistance of counsel. The relevant facts underlying this contention are as follows: In 1969, Sparkman was convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment for the offense of robbery. After exhausting his state remedies, Sparkman filed for federal habeas relief in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas. A hearing was ordered by the district court, and Assistant Attorney General Botley was charged to represent the State. In the course of preparing for the hearing, Botley had the opportunity to review the entire case file and to speak with various people in the community who knew of Joe Allen Sparkman. The district court granted Sparkman habeas relief in March, 1975, and he was released from imprisonment on June 25, 1975. Three months later the rape for which Sparkman was convicted and now appeals occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-11\">When Sparkman was brought to trial in January, 1976, the state trial court granted defendant\u2019s Motion in Limine forbidding the State from making any reference to Sparkman\u2019s 1969 arrest and conviction for robbery. Sparkman was then tried and found guilty of aggravated rape. At the punishment phase of the trial, however, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>State called Botley for the purpose of testifying as to Sparkman\u2019s reputation in the community. Defense counsel objected to the introduction of Botley\u2019s testimony arguing that it would be impossible to cross-examine the witness without delving into the circumstances surrounding the 1969 robbery conviction. His objection was overruled, and Botley was permitted to testify. After stating his name and employment, Botley testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-5\">Q: Mr. Botley, I\u2019d like to ask you if you are familiar with the general reputation in the community in which he resides and among the people who know him, of Joe Sparkman?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-6\">A: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-7\">Q: And are you familiar with his reputation for being a peaceable and law-abiding citizen?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-8\">A: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-9\">Q: And, is that reputation good or bad?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-10\">A: Bad.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b639-11\">Defense counsel did not attempt to cross-examine Botley.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-12\">The essence of petitioner\u2019s argument on appeal is that Sparkman was denied due process by the use of Botley\u2019s testimony which he claims was the \u201cfruit of the poisonous tree,\u201d the poisonous tree allegedly being the prior invalid conviction. Petitioner argues that \u201cthe question in this case becomes whether Botley\u2019s testimony is tainted by the prior void conviction which was obtained at the expense of Sparkman\u2019s constitutional right to effective counsel.\u201d Relying upon various Fourth Amendment cases,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> petitioner argues that if Sparkman had not been denied his right to effective counsel in 1969, Botley would never have learned of Sparkman\u2019s reputation and would not have been able to testify. Thus, Botley\u2019s testimony concerning defendant\u2019s reputation was a direct exploitation of the prior unconstitutional violation he had suffered, and, therefore, should have been excluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-17\">Petitioner\u2019s argument fails for several reasons. The exclusionary rule bars evidentiary \u201cfruit\u201d obtained as \u201ca direct result\u201d of an illegal search, illegal course of interrogation, or other illegal action of the police. <em>Wong Sun v. United States, </em>371 U.S. 471, 485, 83 S.Ct. 407, 416, 9 L.Ed.2d 441, 454 (1963). Exclusion is only appropriate, however, if the \u201cfruit\u201d is sufficiently connected to the illegal \u201ctree.\u201d In <em>Wong Sun, supra, </em>the Supreme Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-18\">We need not hold that all evidence is \u201cfruit of the poisonous tree\u201d simply because it would not have come to light but for the illegal actions of the police. Rather, the more apt question in such a case is \u201cwhether, granting establishment of the primary illegality, the evidence to which instant objection is made has been come at by exploitation of that illegality or instead by means sufficiently distinguishable to be purged of the primary taint.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b639-19\"><em>Id. </em>at 487-88, 83 S.Ct. at 417, 9 L.Ed.2d at 455, <em>quoting </em>R. Maguire, <em>Evidence of Guilt, </em>221 (1959). It is questionable in this case whether Botley\u2019s testimony was in any way the \u201cfruit of the poisonous tree.\u201d Botley obtained his knowledge of appellant\u2019s reputation while investigating the facts of an earlier crime, a presumptively valid conviction. This information was equally available to anyone else, and without regard to whether appellant was convicted of the robbery. Petitioner\u2019s conviction was overturned not for insufficient evidence or for any illegal arrest, search or other improper police activity, but because his lawyer was ineffective. In this light, it is difficult to see the direct connection between the alleged \u201cfruit\u201d \u2014 Botley\u2019s investigation into a valid conviction \u2014 and the \u201cpoisonous tree\u201d \u2014the invalid conviction due to ineffective counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-20\">In any case, where the relationship between the unconstitutional action and the questioned evidence is \u201cso attenuated as to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>dissipate the taint\u201d the evidence is admissible. <em>Nardone v. United States, </em>308 U.S. 338, 60 S.Ct. 266, 84 L.Ed. 307 (1939). In this case, Botley\u2019s investigation and testimony were in no way tainted by the fact that appellant\u2019s counsel failed to represent him properly at his robbery trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-4\">Additionally, this Court in <em>United States v. Brookins, </em>614 F.2d 1037 (5th Cir. 1980) stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-5\">[Rjecent Supreme Court decisions reject earlier statements that portray the exclusion of illegally obtained evidence as constitutionally required and make clear that the exclusionary rule reduces to a \u201cjudicially created remedy\u201d to be applied only when it advances its judicial purpose .... In the fourth amendment context, the \u201csingle and distinct\u201d purpose for the exclusionary rule is deterrence of police violations of that constitutional protection against unreasonable search and seizures .... In the fifth and sixth amendment context, the \u201cprime purpose\u201d of the exclusionary rule as applied to the fruits of police illegality is deterrence of government denial of the self-incrimination privilege or the counsel right, . . . but a secondary purpose is ensuring the trustworthiness of incriminating statements .... The attenuated connection exception and the independent source exception are justified because it is unlikely that suppression of attenuated or independently discovered derivative evidence would deter police misconduct and would bar untrustworthy evidence ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b640-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 1046-47 (citations and footnotes omitted). Application of an exclusionary rule in this case would not deter any illegal government conduct, since none has occurred. In sum, petitioner asks this Court to make a novel interpretation and extension of the \u201cfruit of the poisonous tree\u201d doctrine. He attempts to create an animal which simply does not exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-7\">Finally, even if admission of Botley\u2019s testimony was error, petitioner would not be entitled to federal habeas relief unless the evidence so infected the trial as to deny fundamental fairness. <em>See Corpus v. Estelle, </em>571 F.2d 1378, 1381 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>439 U.S. 957, 99 S.Ct. 359, 58 L.Ed.2d 350 (1978). The testimony must have been \u201c \u2018material in the sense of a crucial, critical, highly significant factor\u2019 \u201d to justify habeas relief. <em>Corpus v. Beto, </em>469 F.2d 953, 956 (5th Cir. 1972), <em>cert. denied </em>414 U.S. 932, 94 S.Ct. 236, 38 L.Ed.2d 162 (1973), <em>quoting Luna v. Beto, </em>395 F.2d 35, 41 (5th Cir. 1968) (en banc) (Brown, J., concurring), <em>cert. denied, </em>394 U.S. 966, 89 S.Ct. 1310, 22 L.Ed.2d 568 (1969). Botley\u2019s brief testimony in the punishment phase of the trial falls far short of this exacting standard. Accordingly, we find no merit to petitioner\u2019s argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b638-9\">. In his federal habeas corpus petition, petitioner set forth seven allegations to support his claim of constitutional deprivation. These allegations were as follows. First, at the punishment phase of petitioner\u2019s trial, the trial court erred by allowing Assistant Attorney General, Calvin Botley, to testify concerning petitioner\u2019s bad reputation in the community. Second, the testimony of Botley was not harmless error. Third, the jury instructions at the guilt or innocence phase of petitioner\u2019s bifurcated trial were improper for the following reasons: (a) the instructions were not limited to the theory in the indictment, rather they applied the word \"force\u201d which is not part of the convicting statute; (b) the instructions authorized conviction under a theory of a lesser included offense, which was not set out in the indictment and not requested by the petitioner; and (c) the instructions only authorized conviction and made no provisions for acquittal. Fourth, the indictment was fatally defective because it did not comply with Article 21.03, Texas Penal Code. Fifth, the trial court erred in its ruling on admissibility of evidence: (a) by refusing to grant petitioner\u2019s motion for mistrial because of prejudicial statements made to the jury by the prosecutor; and (b) by permitting the state to bolster its own witnesses. Sixth, the trial court erred in admitting the following exhibits: (a) exhibit No. 43 because it purported to represent a judgment which was improper and not authorized by law; and (b) exhibit No. 32 because the State did not establish a proper chain of custody. Seventh, the evidence and testimony was insufficient to justify a finding of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt in petitioner\u2019s trial. On appeal, petitioner has raised only the first of these allegations as a ground for error. Accordingly, the remaining issues are deemed waived. <em>Pate v. Wainwright, </em>607 F.2d 669, 670 (5th Cir. 1979).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b639-13\">. Specifically, petitioner refers to <em>Wong Sun v.
