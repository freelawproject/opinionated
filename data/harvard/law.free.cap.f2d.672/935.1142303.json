Two issues are raised for our consideration: (1) whether, following an earlier remand from this court for reconsideration of its dismissal in light of reduced charges, the SSA denied appellant due process by reaffirming its decision; and (2) whether the SSA\u2019s adherence to its prior decision to discharge appellant, notwithstanding the reduced charges, was arbitrary and capricious. We resolve these issues in favor of the SSA\u2019s action; we therefore affirm the district court\u2019s order reinstating summary judgment for defendants-appellees.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-6\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-7\">We shall provide some context to this matter at the outset by capsulizing the events leading to appellant\u2019s discharge from the Social Security Administration (over seven years ago) and the steps leading to his appearance (once again) before this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-8\">Donald Jolly started with the Bureau of Retirement and Survivors Insurance of the Social Security Administration at its Southeastern Program Center in Birmingham, Alabama, in 1960. By December 1969 he had progressed from a GS-5 position to a GS-11 assignment as a quality reviewer in the Quality Appraisal Department, where he performed \u201cend of line\u201d review on samplings of claim files, searching for various processing errors. He remained in this position until early 1971, when he was assigned to a district office visitation program. He was involved exclusively in this program until January 1972.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-9\">During these years with the SSA Jolly was active in union work, and was elected president of Local 2206 of the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE) for three consecutive terms, extending from 1969 to 1972. With union concerns dominating more and more of his time, Jolly took an approved leave of absence from the SSA from January to August of 1972 to devote all his energies to union activities. In August of that year, however, apparently as a result of intraunion friction and controversy, the national union headquarters imposed a trusteeship upon Local 2206 and removed Jolly as president. New local officers were appointed by AFGE leadership in October 1972, which thereby divested appellant of any official union responsibilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-12\">By this time Jolly had entered into the SSA\u2019s Staff Development Program, a program designed to train promising employees for supervisory positions and for which he had been selected in July 1972. Appellant completed the first phase of his training but resigned from the program on 5 January 1973 when he was unable to obtain a six-month extension before being transferred to Atlanta, Georgia, for the second phase.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He was thereafter reassigned to the Quality Appraisal Branch as a quality reviewer. Because his experience in that position had been limited by his involvement in other programs and activities over the previous two years, he was required to retrain for the job.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-13\">It was anticipated that it would take Jolly about two months of retraining to obtain a level of accuracy that would permit \u201cgraduation\u201d from trainee status to that of a final reviewer. In fact, however, he remained a trainee for nine months\u2014 from February through October 1973 \u2014 and, according to management, his work never reached the required level of accuracy. Forms returned to Jolly were accompanied by written critiques indicating errors, but appellant adopted a position that there was in fact no substantial problem with his work. He maintained that the errors identified by reviewers were either not his fault, insignificant, or the result of an inadequate training system. Jolly\u2019s supervisors, on the other hand, saw his poor perform<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"938\">*938</page-number>anee as resulting from \u201chis lack of applying himself and trying to do the work,\u201d his failure to accept suggestions for improving his work, and a general \u201cdefiant\u201d response to any criticism. On 24 July 1973 Jolly was given sixty-days\u2019 notice to improve his work. When the improvement had not occurred by 30 October, appellant was notified by letter that Mr. Yeorgan, the Acting Quality Appraisal Officer, was recommending that Jolly not be retained in the quality review position.</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-4\">Jolly\u2019s duties with the SSA were also affected at least in part by his devotion to union activity. He was, according to management, frequently interrupted by non-work-related phone calls and visitors. While involved even in the \u201cprestigious\u201d staff development program, he refused to accede to a supervisor\u2019s request to cooperate in restricting work interruptions. When, after he returned to quality appraisal, Jolly\u2019s union-related activity continued to occupy an excessive share of his work day and began to interfere with retraining efforts, his new supervisors found it necessary to restrict the number of incoming phone calls during work hours and the amount of work time that could be used to represent other employees\u2019 grievances against management.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1016-5\">On 27 December 1973 Jolly was sent a letter from E. J. Listerman, regional representative of SSA\u2019s Bureau of Retirement and Survivors Insurance, notifying appellant of a proposal to separate him from federal service and listing in detail the reasons for the proposed action. The charges in the notice were essentially these:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1016-6\">1. Poor quality of work;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1016-9\">2. Failure to cooperate with superiors\u2014 specifically:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1016-10\">(a) Failure to cooperate with supervisors\u2019 requests to limit grievance representation in order to permit concentration on retraining for the job;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1016-11\">(b) Failure to cooperate in limiting the number of nonwork-related telephone calls received during work hours;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1016-12\">(c) Resignation from the management training program, causing a waste of time and money spent planning Jolly\u2019s participation in the program and causing an inconvenience to the Atlanta Regional Office.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1016-13\">(d) Refusal to answer management questions concerning the publication of newsletters seen as particularly disparaging to management and of a type which could have a derogatory effect on employee morale;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1016-14\">3. Creating an atmosphere adversely affecting the employee-employer relationship by publishing activist newsletters and by holding himself out as president of Local 2206 after the trusteeship was imposed.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1016-15\">Appellant denied the allegations in Listerman\u2019s letter and requested advisory arbitration, which was agreed to by both the agency and the AFGE. A month-long hearing before the advisory arbitrator yielded an opinion dated 12 December 1974 concurring with the SSA\u2019s proposal to discharge Jolly from federal service. This opinion was accepted by the agency on 20 December 1974, and the decision to separate Jolly from federal service was noticed as effective at the close of business on 27 December 1974.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"939\">*939</page-number>Appellant proceeded to the next stage of available administrative review by appealing the SSA\u2019s decision to the Civil Service Commission\u2019s Federal Employee Appeals Authority (FEAA).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> At appellant\u2019s request a hearing open to the public was conducted by an FEAA representative on 10 and 11 September 1975. For reasons unimportant to the present review, the FEAA effectively struck charge number 3, relating to \u201ccreating an atmosphere adversely affecting employee-employer relationship,\u201d and parts (c) and (d) of charge 2 in the list of particulars, relating to resignation from the management training program and refusal to answer questions regarding the publication of the union\u2019s newsletter. Nevertheless, the FEAA upheld the dismissal on the remaining charges, concluding \u201cthat a removal action based on the sustained charges is not arbitrary, unreasonable or capricious and is for such cause as will promote the efficiency of the service.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Under Civil Service Regulation 772.309(b) the FEAA decision was final and there remained no further right of administrative appeal.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Jolly therefore proceeded to the courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-4\">On 25 May 1976 Jolly brought suit in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia seeking the usual declaratory, injunctive, and compensatory relief. Defendants moved for dismissal or summary judgment, and when Jolly failed to file a timely statement of points and authorities in opposition to defendants\u2019 motion, the district court dismissed the case. This court reversed the dismissal on appeal, however, and remanded the case to the district court for further consideration.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> On remand the district court granted defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment and ordered once again that the action be dismissed.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1017-8\">Undeterred, Jolly followed the usual course by availing himself of a duplicative appeal to this court, arguing for a remand to the Social Security Administration with directions to reconsider the penalty imposed in light of the Civil Service Commission\u2019s having reduced the original charges against him. This court accepted appellant\u2019s request for a remand and made clear its reason for doing so:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1017-9\">When a public employee is dismissed, and some of the grounds for termination are later held to be improper, ... [and] if it is unclear whether the charges were deemed by the agency to constitute separate or cumulative grounds for discharge, the case should be remanded to the agency for reconsideration of the propriety of the punishment imposed.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1017-10\">On 25 July 1980 Harry Overs, Director of the SSA\u2019s Office of Program Service Centers, transmitted to the district court, through the United States Attorney for the District of Columbia, a reply to the court\u2019s order that the SSA reconsider Jolly\u2019s separation. The reply indicated \u201ca careful review of the record of the adverse action file, including the Agency briefs, the appellant\u2019s briefs, the transcript of the adverse action hearing before the Federal Employee Appeals Authority, the Arbitrator\u2019s recommendations and findings, the Assistant Appeals Officers\u2019 recommendations and findings, and Mr. Jolly\u2019s work record.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> It stated further that \u201c[f]ull consideration [had] been given to reinstating Mr. Jolly to his position in the Federal Service,\u201d but that a determination had been made that Jolly\u2019s removal action was appropriate and fully supported by the \u201ccharges and specifi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"940\">*940</page-number>cations sustained by the Federal Employee Appeals Authority.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1018-4\">On 3 September 1980 the district court filed a memorandum order reaffirming its earlier action granting summary judgment to defendant and dismissing plaintiff\u2019s action. Subsequent motion by plaintiff to vacate the summary judgment and enter summary judgment for the plaintiff was denied and appellant once again seeks the review of this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-5\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-6\">Appellant\u2019s arguments for reversal of the district court\u2019s summary judgment upholding the SSA\u2019s action may be grouped into two general positions: First, appellant contends that the agency\u2019s decision to uphold the prior discharge violated his rights to due process under (a) agency regulation and (b) the Fifth Amendment. Second, under a general approach that the SSA\u2019s action was arbitrary and capricious, appellant claims (a) that the charges leading to his discharge are not supported by evidence on the record, and (b) that even if the charges are substantiated, discharge was an excessive penalty under the circumstances. We address each of these arguments in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"ABa\">A. <em>Due Process</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1018-7\">The essence of appellant\u2019s due process arguments is that the trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment for the agency relies upon allegations outside the original charges against Jolly and violates the agency\u2019s rules and regulations as well as Jolly\u2019s constitutional rights to due process. This argument finds root in appellant\u2019s contention that the SSA, in its review of Jolly\u2019s discharge at the behest of this court, actually \u201cdredged up new allegations that were not contained in the agency\u2019s notice of proposal to discharge.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> According to appellant, the charges that Jolly had been uncooperative with retraining efforts by receiving excessive numbers of visitors at his work station, that he had on one occasion been accompanied onto federal property after work hours by a person not employed by the SSA and in the possession of a handgun, and that he had given inconsistent reasons for leaving the Staff Development Program, were not charges included in the original list of particulars incident to his separation and were not supported in the administrative record leading to the district court\u2019s summary judgment. Appellant argues that these charges cannot validly play a part in the SSA\u2019s reconsideration of the propriety of his discharge and that to do so violated regulations binding on the SSA and interfered with Jolly\u2019s due process rights to be given advance notice of reasons relied upon for his removal.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1018-14\">There is nothing essentially wrong with appellant\u2019s argument that an advance notice of reasons for discharging an employee and an opportunity for some kind of hearing on those reasons are vital elements of that employee\u2019s constitutional rights to due process. We are convinced, however, that due process requirements have in every respect been adequately met in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-15\">1. <em>Process due by \u201cregulation\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1018-16\">We recognize, as we have on prior occasions, that an agency is bound by its own procedural rules governing adverse action toward one of its employees, even where such rules require more than may be required under the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> We also recognize, however, that not \u201cevery piece of paper emanating from a Department or Independent Agency is a regulation.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> We feel, upon examination of the \u201cregulation\u201d allegedly violated in this case and by reference to its own language, that it is actually <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"941\">*941</page-number>intended to be something less than a binding rule. The passage, found in the Federal Personnel Manual, states simply that \u201cif the notice of decision [in an adverse personnel action] in any way alters the reasons stated in the advance notice, except to reduce the seriousness of the reasons, the validity of the entire action <em>becomes </em>questionable.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The impact of this provision is clearly informative, perhaps precatory, but certainly not directive or mandatory. The \u201cbecomes questionable\u201d language alone signals no more than a warning to supervisors and management in government agencies that personnel actions must be taken with an eye to eventual and inevitable review under the standards of procedural due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-5\">In this sense, the passage simply calls attention to what the courts themselves have made clear on numerous occasions: an adverse personnel action may fail to pass muster under the Fifth Amendment when it appears to have been taken for reasons other than those of which affected individuals have been given notice and to which they have been allowed to respond.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> This guideline has no meaning independent of the due process considerations inherent therein, and we find no merit in appellant\u2019s independent reliance upon the SSA\u2019s alleged failure to abide by this provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-6\">2. <em>Process due under the Constitution</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1019-7\">It is an elementary principle of constitutional law that the right to due process attaches under the Fifth Amendment only where there is governmental action adversely affecting recognized liberty or property interests.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Interest in continued employment has been recognized as a protectible property interest in some circumstances, as where the employment is tenured or otherwise nonprobationary.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> But, just as there is generally no protected interest in keeping a particular job beyond a probationary period, there is no recognized property right in a mere chance or expectation of being hired (or, we would add, rehired) by a particular employer or to a particular position. The only interests to which due process rights could have attached in this case were appellant\u2019s interests, while still employed in the federal service, in <em>continued </em>employment with the SSA. It is the discharge from this employment alone that is in the first instance arguably restricted by the due process requirements of advance notice and some kind of hearing. It is clear from the record and uncontested by appellant that these requirements were more than adequately satisfied; for purposes of the original discharge, by the advance notice given to Jolly and by the process afforded him in the lengthy evidentiary hearing before an independent advisory arbitrator, as well as the open hearing before the FEAA.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-12\">We find nothing in the SSA\u2019s reconsideration of the discharge which affects this clear compliance with constitutional due process. It is true that within the context of discussing Jolly\u2019s lack of cooperation with his superiors, the SSA\u2019s letter to Judge Pratt refers to the presence of excessive visitors at Jolly\u2019s work station. We are not persuaded, however, that this is a \u201cnew charge,\u201d as appellant would have us find; rather, it is an observation interrelated with appellant\u2019s continued activity in union representation, his apparent misuse of official time, and the frequent work interruptions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"942\">*942</page-number>specifically charged in the initial letter of particulars and addressed by evidence in testimony by both sides at the hearings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-4\">As to the remaining \u201cnew charges\u201d with which appellant takes issue, we find the Government\u2019s explanation and characterization helpful. The Government points out in its brief that the \u201ccharges\u201d relating to the handgun incident and to the appellant\u2019s having given inconsistent reasons for leaving the Staff Development Program were in fact not relied upon in the portion of the SSA letter which addressed whether the charges against appellant, as reduced by the Civil Service Commission, were sufficient grounds for dismissal.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Reference to these incidents was limited to the SSA\u2019s <em>separate </em>consideration of whether, in spite of the determined validity of the grounds for appellant\u2019s discharge, discretionary <em>reinstatement </em>or <em>reassignment </em>would be appropriate. There is no constitutional error in this approach by the SSA, taken as it was in the context of a post-decision review.</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-5\">We noted above that the formalities of procedural due process were clearly satisfied in the actions leading to Jolly\u2019s discharge. If we assume further, at least for purposes of present analysis, that the agency also did not step outside of statutory bounds,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> we may treat Jolly as constitutionally unemployed, i.e., as having been constitutionally deprived of any preexisting property interest in his SSA employment. Upon such a discharge, he is in precisely the same position (although for slightly different reasons) as any person who has no position in government service; and any subsequent decision by an employing agency, whether another agency considering whether to hire him, or the SSA pondering possible reinstatement, is <em>not </em>governed by the normal procedural standards of due process. There is thus no basis in a due process argument for prohibiting the SSA\u2019s reference to or reliance upon facts or factors neither included in the notice of discharge nor addressed on the record in determining whether the agency should exercise its purely discretionary power to reinstate Jolly into SSA service.</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-9\">Appellant counters this position with an argument that such a bifurcated approach does not comply with the prior \u201cdirective\u201d of this court. It describes the Government\u2019s explanation as \u201ctwisting this Court\u2019s remand into a two-step process of first determining whether \u2018the remaining charges warranted . . . dismissal\u2019 and then \u2018to make a separate determination of whether to reinstate appellant and reassign him.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Appellant argues that there is nothing in this court\u2019s memorandum opinion remanding the case to the SSA which supports this two-tiered consideration. Rather, it is proffered, the SSA was bound, in deciding whether Jolly should have been discharged, to a consideration of only (1) Jolly\u2019s performance record prior to the problems arising in the early 1970\u2019s; (2) the fact that the original charges were reduced; and (3) the court\u2019s observation that the remaining charges appeared to be \u201cslight.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-10\">Appellant obviously misinterprets the thrust of the earlier memorandum opinion. This court simply intended, by remanding the case, to give the SSA an \u201copportunity to <em>reconsider </em>the exercise of its discretion.\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> It did not dictate an outcome or place specific procedural strictures upon the SSA any more than it afforded Jolly a chance <em>de novo </em>to challenge the factual conclusions drawn in prior adjudicatory proceedings. The SSA clearly satisfied the overall purpose of the remand and answered this court\u2019s concern by signaling that the original charges were not cumulative.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> We find no violation of due process in the approach adopted by the SSA in making this determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"943\">*943</page-number>B. <em>The Arbitrary and Capricious Test</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1021-5\">Appellant\u2019s second area of argument is directed at alleged infirmities in the substantive aspect of this dismissal action. He contends that even if the SSA\u2019s action was procedurally sound, it must still fail because (1) the charges are not supported by the evidence on the record, and (2) even if the charges were established, the discharge itself was unjustified. For reasons discussed below, we find these arguments without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-6\">1. <em>The charges and the record</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1021-7\">Appellant contends that the charges against him were not established by \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d on the record and that the agency\u2019s action must for that reason be reversed. He supports this argument, however, with little more than a claim that the charges themselves were merely \u201cpretextual,\u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> and a restatement of his version of the facts. It is clear from the extensive factual arguments in his brief that <em>appellant\u2019s actual contention is not that the agency failed to present sufficient evidence to support his discharge, but that this court should find the agency\u2019s evidence unpersuasive against that offered by the appellant. </em>We of course may not follow this invitation to reweigh the evidence and at the same time adhere to our proper role in the review of personnel actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-8\">Our scope of review in a case of this type is exceedingly narrow,<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> restricted by relevant authority to a consideration <em>only </em>of whether the SSA\u2019s action is arbitrary and capricious, <em>i.e. </em>whether the conclusions upon which the agency acted are supported by record evidence and whether there is in other respects a rational basis for the discharge itself.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> While this does require as a first step a review of the record, we are not here to retry the facts. There is no appeal on the merits as such in personnel actions of this type. Thus, where there is sufficient evidence upon which to base a rational finding, we do not have the right to retry the case on the theory that the factual conclusions were wrong. As this court has stated,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1021-13\">[Fjederal judges do not sit as ombudsmen for government employment relations, nor do we indulge the conceit of substituting our own judgment <em>ad libitum </em>for that of the agency. Rather, we concern ourselves in the personnel business only insofar as is necessary to assure that the action challenged (1) is not arbitrary or capricious; (2) was reached in conformity with relevant procedural requirements; and (3) was not otherwise unconstitutional.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1021-14\">We are therefore concerned, not with whether the factual issues in this case were resolved by the factfinders as we or as our dissenting colleague might have resolved them, but only with whether the factual conclusions are based on some evidence, <em>i.e., </em>whether the agency engaged in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"944\">*944</page-number>informed decisionmaking. There is adequate evidence in this case supporting the remaining charges against Jolly to satisfy us that the agency\u2019s action on the charges listed against Jolly was not irrational or otherwise arbitrary and capricious.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> Our evidentiary review need go no further.</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-4\">2. <em>The severity of the punishment</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1022-5\">Appellant\u2019s ultimate argument is that even if due process was afforded and even if there is evidence to support the charges, his discharge was excessive punishment and for that reason unwarranted by those charges as ultimately reduced. He relies in part on this court\u2019s earlier observation that the reduced charges seemed \u201cslight in view of [Jolly\u2019s] many years of service.\u201d<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> He also claims that the SSA had not discharged other employees with unsatisfactory performance and that it was bound to follow a less severe disciplinary route, such as transfer, before resorting to discharge from the service. We address this latter argument first.</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-6\">Appellant maintains that administrative policy binding on the SSA requires the attempted reassignment of employees with performance-related problems before reverting to the more harsh alternative of permanent discharge. The SSA\u2019s failure to conform to this requirement, according to Jolly, deals a fatal blow to the reasonableness of the discharge in this instance. Appellant would find this \u201cpolicy\u201d in SSA personnel guidelines or in prior agency practice. We find it in neither.</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-10\">The personnel guideline to which appellant refers states simply that \u201c[a]n employee should not remain indefinitely in a position in which he is not performing at an acceptable level of competence. If he cannot be trained or motivated to perform the job acceptably, an attempt should be made to place him in a more suitable job.\u201d<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> Appellant puts particular weight on this guideline because this court referred to it in its prior memorandum opinion, hinting that it might properly be factored into the SSA\u2019s ultimate decision concerning the propriety of Jolly\u2019s discharge.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> We do not feel, however, upon examination of this guideline and its context, that it constitutes a rule or regulation limiting the agency\u2019s options in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-11\">First of all, the quoted phrase appears in a context of guidelines relating, not to discharges, or even to disciplinary actions in general, but to grants or denials of within-grade increases. There is no indication whatsoever in the guideline itself or in the surrounding text that its provisions have any relevance outside of this area. Certainly we have no basis for holding that this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"945\">*945</page-number>\u201crule\u201d was intended to apply to adverse actions of the sort before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-4\">Secondly, even if the guideline were intended to find some application outside the context of within-grade increases, we would not be convinced that it would be a binding rule. The use of the word \u201cshould\u201d in the phrase detracts significantly from any claim that this guideline is more than merely precatory. The fact that it is described as a \u201cguideline\u201d should also hint of precatory intent. We simply do not think that it may reasonably be interpreted as a binding procedural rule with which the SSA must comply in a personnel action of this nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-5\">No doubt anticipating such a conclusion, appellant argues further that an unwritten but nevertheless binding rule has arisen from a common SSA practice of seeking transfers as a prior alternative to seeking discharge for individuals in Jolly\u2019s position. As the Government points out, however, appellant is attempting by this argument to create a binding rule or regulation from a \u201ccommon law\u201d of only two instances occurring prior to his own discharge<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> where SSA employees were transferred rather than discharged. In one case, a quality appraiser whose errors had skewed national statistical results had responded to additional training and was allowed to remain on the job.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> The second case to which appellant refers is that of an individual who was having unhappy experiences with his job and who was able to obtain a transfer to another department.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> Not only is the factual similarity between the circumstances of these two cases and those underlying Jolly\u2019s discharge less than striking, but we do not believe that two instances alone provide a sufficient basis for finding an \u201cestablished\u201d practice giving rise to a binding rule of \u201ctransfer prior to discharge.\u201d There is no reason in this case to so limit agency discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-8\">Even though subject to procedural strictures of the due process clause, statute, and sometimes regulation, the disciplinary power of an employer in the public sector, just as that of a business or individual in the private sector, remains largely discretionary. The Federal Personnel Manual, to which appellant himself cites, admits that \u201c[tjhere are many situations which may call for disciplinary action and [that] a wide variety of disciplinary actions are available. ... <em>There is no substitute for judgment in selecting among </em>them.\u201d<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> To accept appellant\u2019s argument for a type of \u201ccommon law\u201d rule binding the SSA in this case would be to deprive the SSA of the important role that judgment of the often unique circumstances of an individual case must play in the overall disciplinary scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-9\">The personnel manual does call for \u201clike penalties for like offenses.\u201d It warns, however, that <em>\u201csurface </em>consistency should be avoided.\u201d<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> Emphasis is placed on appropriate agency consideration of all factors, particularly whether the action accords with justice in the particular situation. The determination of justice resides with the agency alone, subject of course to review for arbitrary and capricious action. We find in the totality of pertinent guidelines and policies behind effective administration and management no rule or regulation, whether explicit or arising as some sort of administrative estoppel from precedential practices, which dictates that the SSA must attempt to transfer an employee before it considers discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-10\">Our attention turns finally to appellant\u2019s contention that the discharge was simply not justified by the reduced charges and to his reliance for this position upon the footnote observation in the memorandum <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"946\">*946</page-number>opinion accompanying r.emand of this case that \u201cmany of the specific charges seem slight.\u201d As this court has stated,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1024-4\">There may be ground for reasonable differences of opinion as to whether the cause for which the personnel action was taken was grave enough to warrant depriving appellant of his position, but the court is not warranted in substituting a different judgment of its own for that of appellant\u2019s superiors, whose action has been sustained by the Civil Service Commission and the district court.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AqKi\">While this observation was made in a case that preceded the more recent trend by the courts to review personnel actions in general, its principle has been reaffirmed in other cases. In <em>Giles v. United </em>States<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> the Court of Claims held that an administrative determination of appropriate punishment in civil service disciplinary actions is judicially reviewable only if the punishment is <em>ultra vires </em>or totally unwarranted.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> Stated in other terms, a court will not reverse on review where the penalty is not \u201cso harsh and unconscionably disproportionate to the offense that it amounts to an abuse of discretion.\u201d<footnotemark>41</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1024-5\">In the review of penalties in particular, the \u201cabuse of discretion\u201d or \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d tests focus on the relationship between the penalty, the offense, and the efficiency of the service.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> Where this relationship is rationally based, we cannot say that there has been an abuse of agency discretion. Furthermore, where, as here, an employee has been afforded a full evidentiary hearing before an impartial factfinder and an open hearing before an impartial review board, the conclusions and recommendations of those bodies are due some weight, if not considerable deference.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-12\">In Jolly\u2019s case an independent arbitrator, after an extensive hearing involving examination and cross-examination by both sides, recommended that the agency discharge Jolly. The SSA discharged Jolly, the FEAA upheld the discharge on administrative appeal, and the district court upheld the discharge on the SSA\u2019s motion for summary judgment. There is no contention that the question of punishment was not fully reviewed at each level. Jolly argues that the recommendations and decisions were excessive.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-13\">It is within the entire context of procedure and deliberation that the observation by this court in its memorandum opinion that the charges seemed \u201cslight\u201d must be read. As we have emphasized before, the memorandum opinion was not intended to dictate to the SSA a final outcome in this case. It was simply this court\u2019s impression that under the circumstances of the FEAA\u2019s reduction of the charges the SSA should be given an opportunity to reconsider its position and to make clear whether the original charges were intended to be cumulative, or whether separate charges, standing alone, would have likewise resulted in Jolly\u2019s discharge. We are convinced that the SSA adequately reconsidered Jolly\u2019s situation upon remand, and we find no compelling reason in the record to question the SSA\u2019s ultimate judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-14\">There is no draconian disproportion between the ultimate charges of unsatisfactory performance and lack of cooperation on the one hand and the penalty of dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"947\">*947</page-number>charge on the other which would signal an abuse of discretion in the selection of the appropriate mode of discipline. There is no call for us to overturn the FEAA-approved and SSA-reaffirmed penalty determination in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-4\">C. <em>The Dissent\u2019s Reliance Upon the </em>Porter Cases<footnotemark>43</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1025-5\">We have considered the <em>Porter </em>cases relied upon by Judge Edwards in his dissent, and we disagree that our opinion today is inconsistent with these Fifth Circuit cases. Although the cases are in a sense factually related to the instant case,<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> separate legal issues are raised.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-6\">The <em>Porter </em>cases dealt with constitutional questions which are not before this court. Appellant there charged that \u201cher Fifth Amendment right to due process was violated because she was suspended [for thirty days] without being allowed a full evidentiary hearing and that her First Amendment right of free speech was violated because she was punished for making protected speech.\u201d<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> The Fifth Circuit\u2019s holding on these combined issues was narrow. It held that it was inappropriate to rule against important constitutional claims by summary judgment when no evidentiary hearing had been held to settle genuine and material factual disputes, and on this basis it remanded to the district court for discovery and full trial.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1025-11\">The Fifth Circuit did not predetermine that there was no basis for Porter\u2019s suspension, just as it did not rule on the First Amendment claims. As Senior Judge Skelton, sitting on the panel by designation, observed in a specially concurring opinion, \u201cIt may be that the agency was justified in suspending the appellant for 30 days. Whether or not this is so will now be determined in a meaningful hearing held in the district court. Consequently, it would be inappropriate for us to express an opinion on the merits of the case.\u201d <footnotemark>47</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1025-12\">We fail to see the similarities that Judge Edwards finds between the <em>Porter </em>cases and the matter before us. First, and contrary to <em>Porter, </em>there was a full evidentiary hearing in this case, and there is no continuing First Amendment issue before this court.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> Second, there is still no record of any resolution of the factual issues in <em>Porter. </em>The Fifth Circuit made clear that one reason for the remand was to clear up the several issues which made factual conclusions impossible. Certainly, there was no resolution in <em>Porter </em>of the facts pertinent to Jolly\u2019s case. As the <em>Porter </em>court noted, \u201c[T]he record in the instant case does not contain the record in the Jolly case, or even an adequate description of it by someone other than Porter.\u201d<footnotemark>49</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1025-13\">In our opinion, the dissent stretches the Fifth Circuit\u2019s position in either <em>Porter I </em>or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"948\">*948</page-number><em>II </em>to suggest that it shows that Jolly was arbitrarily discharged and that our decision here, where a full and complete evidentiary hearing was provided, runs counter to those cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-4\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-5\">Despite the concern of our dissenting colleague, which is strongly expressed and no doubt conscientiously held, this case does not involve a retaliatory dismissal of a whistle-blower \u2014 an action that no member of this court would countenance. We hold only that the findings and action of the responsible authorities were justified on the administrative record by Jolly\u2019s failure to achieve an acceptable level of performance in his assigned tasks. This opinion should be read to imply no more than what it clearly holds.</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-6\">We have no reason to doubt that appellant Jolly was once a valuable employee of the SSA. It is apparent, however, that his increasing involvement with other interests, his union concerns and fights against new union leadership on the one hand and confrontations with management on the other, detracted significantly from the attention he was willing or able to devote to reacquainting himself with his job responsibilities. After returning full time to the SSA, he simply never got back to an acceptable work level on the job for which he was being paid day by day. It is always unfortunate when management finds it necessary to discharge an employee, but it is not our position to question the propriety of such an action when Jolly himself has been afforded more than ample opportunity to make his case and when impartial adjudication at various levels has supported the SSA\u2019s action.</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-7\">This court\u2019s remand to the SSA had the limited purpose of seeking reassurance that the SSA\u2019s action would have been the same had it considered the charges as ultimately reduced. The SSA\u2019s reconsideration of the circumstances of the case and its reaffirmance of the initial discharge satisfies this concern. We have not been shown that the agency\u2019s decision was the result of an arbitrary and capricious approach to Jolly\u2019s situation, nor is there any indication that appellant has been afforded less than adequate due process. It is therefore not within our power or prerogative as a reviewing court to question the SSA\u2019s exercise of its discretionary powers as an employer, nor to reverse the SSA\u2019s decision. The district judge\u2019s opinion on this was the same: the facts supported Jolly\u2019s discharge. For this reason, and taking the record itself as undisputed, we find no cause to overturn the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment. The district court\u2019s order is therefore</p>\n<p id=\"AmY\">\n<em>Affirmed</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1015-10\">.

As Judge Tamm observed in some detail in <em>Doe v.

Furthermore, in light of the traditional view that the substantial evidence test affords \u201ca considerably more generous judicial review than the \u2018arbitrary and capricious\u2019 test,\u201d <em>Abbott Laboratories v.

Board of Education, </em>391 U.S. 563, 88 S.Ct. 1731, 20 L.Ed.2d 811 (1968), and referred to in the Fifth Circuit\u2019s guidance to the district court in <em>Porter I. </em>562 F.2d at 773.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"49\">\n<p id=\"Aa-\">. <em>Id. </em>at 777.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b1026-10\">HARRY T. EDWARDS, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AV-8\">dissenting:</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-11\">The majority\u2019s decision in this case appears to prove the point that an individual employee who \u201cblows the whistle\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> on allegedly corrupt Government officials may eventually be swallowed by the system that he has challenged. The result here, as mandated by. the majority decision, is surely a bitter defeat for an employee who deserved better at the hands of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-12\">I am sorry that this court has been made an instrument of injustice by Government officials determined to destroy an individual who has served in the federal service for many years as a \u201cvaluable employee.\u201d Majority op. at 947. The majority has obviously turned a \u201cdeaf ear\u201d to appellant\u2019s claim. This is unfortunate because it plainly has made it impossible for the majority to recognize that the Government\u2019s position in this case is a sham.</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-13\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-14\">This is a simple case of <em>unlawful retaliation </em>against appellant, Donald Jolly, who\u2014 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"949\">*949</page-number>prior to his discharge \u2014 had worked for fourteen years with the Social Security Administration (SSA) at its Southeastern Program Center in Birmingham, Alabama. Mr. Jolly was fired only after he \u201cblew the whistle\u201d on certain SSA officials, by publishing a Newsletter accusing them of being involved in the purchase of AMWAY distributorships \u2014 a pyramid sales scheme involving the sale of women\u2019s clothing and cosmetics \u2014 and then extending preferential treatment to employees who agreed to sell the AMWAY products for them. Two of the officials who had been accused, a Mr. Listerman and a Mr. Bruce, were the principal management officials who acted to effectuate Mr. Jolly\u2019s termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-4\">From the start, it has been evident that management has attempted to hang Mr. Jolly with trumped-up charges. Indeed, as will be indicated below, the management disciplinary process has been a farce as the charges against Mr. Jolly have been modified at least four times during the course of the proceedings in this case. For this court to indulge \u2014 much less approve \u2014 the Government\u2019s actions in this case is a travesty and gross miscarriage of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-6\">On two previous occasions, this court has ruled against the Government on appeals brought by Mr. Jolly.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Fifth Circuit has also twice ruled against the Government in a separate but related case involving an employee who sought to defend Mr. Jolly and, as a consequence, was suspended by the same two supervisors who had acted to fire Jolly. <em>See Porter I </em>and <em>Porter II, supra </em>note 1. On this third appeal, after this court has already indicated in <em>Jolly II (see </em>APPENDIX A) that \u201cthe specific charges against Jolly seem slight,\u201d and noted \u201cthe questionable circumstance that [Jolly\u2019s] interrogation was conducted by one of the very supervisors the employee has publicly accused of wrongdoing,\u201d and expressed a strong view that \u201cJolly will be reinstated (\u201cin light of the reduced charges against him\u201d), it is astonishing that the majority now rules that we must turn a \u201cdeaf ear\u201d to the appellant\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-9\">The result reached by the majority is legally unjustified. Worse, the decision of the court today rubber stamps lawless Government actions that mock all notions of justice and fair play. I am convinced that many of Mr. Jolly\u2019s former colleagues at work, upon reading the majority opinion, will be convinced that it never pays to buck the system, especially if you are required to \u201cblow the whistle\u201d on an allegedly corrupt supervisor who is in a position to retaliate. It is unfortunate indeed that this message is being delivered by a court of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-10\">II. THE CRITICAL FACTS MISSING FROM THE MAJORITY OPINION</p>\n<p id=\"Azk5\">Before proceeding to explain why I feel that the legal holding offered by the majority is plainly wrong, it is important first to highlight the critical facts in this case. The facts set forth in the majority opinion are, for the most part, entirely accurate. The problem, however, is that the majority fails to paint the full picture and thus effectively obscures Mr. Jolly\u2019s real complaint. In my view, once all of the facts are considered, there can be no doubt that the action taken against Mr. Jolly was arbitrary and capricious.</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-11\">1. <em>Mr. Jolly\u2019s Employment Record at SSA</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1027-12\">Donald G. Jolly was a career civil servant who had been continuously employed by the Federal Government from 1955 until 1974. Mr. Jolly first gained employment with the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, Social Security Administration in 1960, and worked continuously for SSA at the Southeastern Program Center, Birming<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"950\">*950</page-number>ham, Alabama, until he was fired in 1974. During his 14-year tenure with the SSA, Mr. Jolly received numerous promotions. At the time of his discharge, Mr. Jolly held the highest technical position within the agency, that of Quality Appraiser in the Quality Appraisal Branch. Further, during his tenure with the government, Mr. Jolly had received over 40 commendations and, prior to 1973, he had never received a work evaluation from a superior that was not outstanding. Indeed, in 1969, Mir. Jolly received a high quality increase in pay as a reward for outstanding work. A. 33-34.</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-4\">It is important to understand the truly outstanding record compiled by Mr. Jolly during his many years of government service in order to comprehend the pretextual nature of the charges against him. Jolly was not an employee with a history of difficulty, either in his job performances or other personnel relations. His problems arose only when he chose not to continue participation in a management Staff Development Program, and when he \u201cblew the whistle\u201d on allegedly corrupt supervisors. As will be shown below, it was these two factors \u2014 not any deficiency in his work performance \u2014 that resulted in his discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-5\">2. <em>The Nebulous and Ever-Changing \u201cCharges\u201d Against Mr. Jolly</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1028-6\">To read the majority opinion, one might get the impression that this case involves a straightforward charge of employee misconduct or poor performance. Quite the contrary. Instead, we have a situation involving an employee who has been subjected to unlawful retaliation and agency officials who have searched in vain for some legitimate reasons to justify their lawless actions. This point is proven by the nebulous and ever-changing charges leveled against Mr. Jolly as this case has progressed through several appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-15\">THE FIRST SET OF CHARGES: In September of 1973, shortly after Mr. Jolly had published a Newsletter accusing Mr. Listerman and Mr. Bruce of being involved in the AMWAY scheme, Jolly received a letter advising him that Mr. Listerman proposed to suspend him for \u201cpublishing .. . unsupported derogatory allegations, inflammatory remarks, and improper inferences in a publication entitled \u2018Newsletter,\u2019 dated August 1973.\u201d A. 83. On December 27, 1973, Listerman withdrew his proposal to suspend Jolly and substituted a proposal \u201cto separate [Jolly] from the Federal service ... no earlier than 30 days from the date [when Jolly received the] notice.\u201d A. 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-16\">Although Listerman never acted on his initial threat to suspend Jolly for publishing the Newsletter, it is important to note that the September 1973 notice of suspension was the first significant act of discipline proposed by management against Jolly.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> It is also important to recall that the proposed suspension came only after Jolly had publicly accused Listerman and Bruce of misconduct in connection with the AMWAY scheme.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1028-17\">THE SECOND SET OF CHARGES: In the separation notice of December 27, 1973, Mr. Listerman proposed to fire Mr. Jolly for the following reasons:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1028-18\">1. \u201cPoor quality of work.\u201d A. 5.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1028-19\">2. \u201cFailure to cooperate with your supervisors,\u201d A. 8, including:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1029-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"951\">*951</page-number>a. Too much time expended representing agency employees in grievance matters.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1029-5\">b. Failure to limit the number of telephone calls received.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1029-6\">c. Resignation from the Staff Development Program. A. 9-10.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1029-7\">d. Refusal to answer questions from management concerning the publication of the Newsletter. A. 10.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1029-8\">3. \u201cCreating an atmosphere adversely affecting employee-employer relationship.\u201d <footnotemark>7</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1029-9\">THE THIRD SET OF CHARGES: Following Mr. Jolly\u2019s hearing before the Civil Service Commission\u2019s Federal Employee Appeals Authority (FEAA), charge number 3 and parts c and d of charge number 2 from the December 27, 1973 notice of separation were deleted from the list of accusations leveled against Mr. Jolly. Nevertheless, in a decision rendered on November 10, 1975, the FEAA affirmed Mr. Jolly\u2019s discharge on the <em>reduced grounds (i.e., </em>including only charges 1, 2a. and 2b.), concluding that the removal action was \u201cnot arbitrary, unreasonable or capricious and [was] for such cause as will promote the efficiency of the service.\u201d A. 16, 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-10\">THE FOURTH SET OF CHARGES: After this court vacated the judgment in favor of the Government in <em>Jolly II (see </em>APPENDIX A), and ordered that \u201cthe case should be remanded to the agency for reconsideration of the propriety of the punishment imposed,\u201d the Government once again changed its list of charges against Mr. Jolly. It is not surprising that the Government resorted to further <em>post hoc </em>rationalizations upon remand; agency officials obviously recognized that charges 2a. and 2b. from the December 27, 1973 notice of separation were patently without merit, <em>see </em>notes 3, 5 and 6, <em>supra, </em>and that charge 1 had been shown to be baseless, <em>see </em>Appellant\u2019s Brief at 11-16. Nevertheless, the important point here is that the Government\u2019s reliance on <em>new charges </em>after this case was remanded to the agency was wholly improper.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1029-16\">Appellant, in his Reply Brief to this court, makes the following compelling argument regarding the agency\u2019s belated reliance on <em>new charges:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1029-17\">On remand, SSA was to reconsider the \u201cpropriety of Jolly\u2019s dismissal in light of\u201d (a) the reduced charges that \u201cseem slight\u201d; (b) Mr. Jolly\u2019s many years of service and (c) \u201cSSA\u2019s own guidelines [which] provide for an attempt to place an employee in a more suitable position if his or her performance is unsatisfactory\u201d (A. 4). It did not do this. It did not limit its reconsideration to the reduced charges. It gave no consideration to the 14 years of exceptional service Jolly had given to SSA. And it gave no consideration to whether Mr. Jolly could have been placed in a more suitable position before he was discharged. Instead, SSA \u201creconsidered\u201d the propriety of Mr. Jolly\u2019s dismissal in light of new allegations that were not in the original notice of proposed discharge, were not in the record, or were rejected by the Civil Service Commission. This action by SSA was improper and constituted a denial of due <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"952\">*952</page-number>process. Furthermore, stripped of all of the improper considerations, SSA\u2019s decision to discharge Mr. Jolly on the reduced charges is arbitrary and capricious and without justification. Indeed, the reduced charges that SSA relies upon are pretextual. The real reasons for Mr. Jolly\u2019s discharge remain his resignation from the Staff Development Program and his publication of the August Newsletter....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1030-4\">The three charges that were relied upon by SSA on remand but were not in the notice of proposal to discharge and were unrelated to the reduced charges that remain, are:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1030-5\">(1) That Mr. Jolly was uncooperative in that he had \u201cexcessive visitors at his work station\u201d, and when it was brought to his attention \u201ctook no steps to correct the problem\u201d (A. 61);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1030-6\">(2) That \u201cMr. Jolly was accompanied by a person not employed by the Agency onto federal property after work hours while in the possession of a handgun\u201d (A. 62); and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1030-7\">(3) That Mr. Jolly gave inconsistent reasons for leaving the Staff Development Program (A. 62).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1030-8\">SSA argues that the charge of \u201cexcessive visitors\u201d was not new but rather was \u201cinterrelated\u201d with other charges. SSA also argues that the latter two charges were not considered in its determination that the reduced charges justified Mr. Jolly\u2019s discharge, but only in its determination of whether reinstatement was warranted. Both arguments are unavailing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1030-9\">Appellant\u2019s Reply Brief at 10-12. Appellant\u2019s contentions are neither surprising, nor are they the product of artful advocacy. Rather, the contentions flow from simple conclusions easily drawn from the plain record of evidence in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-10\">In <em>Tygrett v. Barry, </em>627 F.2d 1279 (D.C.Cir.1980), this court held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1030-11\">Absent the complicating factor of constitutionally protected conduct, a public employee can be discharged for a variety of reasons, and a probationary employee for even gossamer causes. That being so, any kind of reconstruction of the reasoning behind the discharge that provides the employer with a post hoc justification for its action cannot be allowed. To permit that kind of judicial \u201creview\u201d would eviscerate <em>Pickering\u2019s </em>effort to prevent the state from using its control over a person\u2019s job to penalize its employees for the exercise of their First Amendment rights. Therefore, it is essential, as Judge Leventhal said in an analogous case, that the court reviewing the discharge restrict its focus to \u201cthe reasons given by the [employer] and not on reasons that may come to light if and when a court rummages throughout the record in an effort to reconstruct on what basis the [employer] might have decided the matter.\u201d <em>United States ex rel. Checkman v. Laird, </em>469 F.2d 773, 783 (2d Cir. 1972).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AIB\"><em>Id. </em>at 1286. The principle enunciated in <em>Tygrett </em>is perfectly applicable here. Not only does this case involve a rather blatant attempt by the employer to \u201creconstruct\u201d the bases of discharge, but it also involves what this court recognized in <em>Jolly II as a </em>\u201cdifficult [First Amendment] constitutional issue raised by Jolly on appeal.\u201d <em>See </em>APPENDIX A.</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-13\">3. <em>The Charge That Mr. Jolly\u2019s Quality of Work Was Poor Is Baseless</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1030-14\">As suggested above, <em>see </em>notes 3, 5 and 6, <em>supra, </em>the only possible charge left to be raised against Mr. Jolly is the claim that the quality of his work was poor. The problem with this charge, however, is that there is absolutely no evidence to support it.</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-15\">The agency offered no standard against which to measure Mr. Jolly\u2019s work performance. The majority opinion argues that Jolly was discharged because, \u201caccording to management, his work never reached <em>the required level of accuracy.\u201d </em>Majority op. at 937 (emphasis added). But the record in this case reveals that management has acknowledged that there was no \u201crequired level of accuracy\u201d for Quality Appraisers. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"953\">*953</page-number>See, <em>e.g., </em>A. 88.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> That is precisely the problem. Indeed, <em>there is nothing in the record to even indicate whether Jolly\u2019s work performance was better or worse in 197S than it had been in prior years when he was recognized to be an outstanding Quality Appraiser!</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1031-5\">Additionally, Dr. William Campbell, a statistician employed by Mr. Jolly, made the only objective comparative analysis of Mr. Jolly\u2019s performance with that- of others. Based on Dr. Campbell\u2019s analysis, Jolly ranked among the top three Quality Appraisers in every category in terms of both productivity and accuracy. Dr. Campbell\u2019s assumptions were based upon the testimony of Brian Feldman, who was characterized by his supervisor, Mrs. Chlebowski, as an experienced and fully satisfactory employee in the Quality Appraisal Unit. Appellant\u2019s Brief at 14 (citing from Civil Service Transcript at 270). Even assuming Mr. Feldman\u2019s testimony only explains his own practices, Dr. Campbell\u2019s charts showed that Don Jolly\u2019s record was as good or better than Brian Feldman\u2019s and that Feldman and Jolly both did exactly the same \u201cend of line\u201d review work on samplings of claim files. A. 25. Mr. Feldman continues to work in the Quality Appraisal Unit.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1031-6\">The plain truth of the matter is that certain officials at the SSA were out to get Mr. Jolly when he resigned from the Staff Development Program. The resolve of these officials was heightened when Mr. Jolly \u201cblew the whistle\u201d on them and publicly exposed the AMWAY scheme. The majority decision is seemingly blind to these realities \u2014 realities implicitly recognized in our decision in <em>Jolly II (see </em>APPENDIX A), and explicitly acknowledged in two separate decisions of the Fifth Circuit in <em>Porter I </em>and <em>Porter II, supra </em>note 1. It is too bad that the \u201cdeaf ear\u201d of the majority has prevented them from hearing the truth.</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-12\">III. THE AGENCY\u2019S FAILURE TO REASSIGN MR. JOLLY WAS ITSELF ARBITRARY AND CAPRICIOUS, AND FURTHER EVIDENCE OF UNLAWFUL RETALIATION</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-13\">Section VIII-C (\u201cMandatory Review of Negative Determinations\u201d) of the SSA <em>Personnel Guides For Supervisors, </em>states, in part, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1031-14\">An employee should not remain indefinitely in a position in which he is not performing at an acceptable level of competence. If he cannot be trained or motivated to perform the job acceptably, <em>an attempt should be made to place him in a more suitable job.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1031-15\">A. 96 (emphasis added). If it may be assumed, <em>arguendo, </em>that Mr. Jolly\u2019s work performance during 1973 was in fact unacceptable, then agency rules required that Mr. Jolly be placed \u201cin a more suitable job.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AXk\">Despite the Government\u2019s arguments to the contrary, the aforecited <em>Personnel Guide </em>is both clear and mandatory in its terms. Furthermore, the record is replete with uncontested evidence indicating that section VIII-C of the <em>Personnel Guide </em>routinely has been implemented by an SSA practice of reassigning, rather than dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"954\">*954</page-number>charging, employees who are not performing at an acceptable level. A. 78-82. For example, the <em>unrefuted </em>affidavit of Donald W. Jones, President of one of the largest AFGE locals, states that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1032-4\">During these 12 years, I have participated in thousands of grievances involving employees of SSA, some of who [sic] have received notices of proposed disciplinary actions including proposed discharges. Also, I have been directly involved in dozens of cases in our program center in which management sought to discipline employees because of their unsatisfactory work performance. In each of these cases, management has followed its own procedure of placing the employee in a more suitable position either through lateral transfer or through a demotion, rather than discharging the employee. In fact, I do not know of a single instance in which an SSA employee who was unable to perform satisfactorily has been discharged without management first placing that employee in a more suitable position.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1032-5\">A. 78. There is absolutely nothing in the evidence in this case, or in the Government\u2019s brief to this court, that can be read to deny or dispute the well-established reassignment practice described by Mr. Jones and other witnesses giving statements on behalf of Mr. Jolly.</p>\n<p id=\"b1032-6\">In <em>Doe v. Hampton, </em>566 F.2d 265 (D.C.Cir.1977), this court held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1032-7\">It is, of course, well-established that an agency must abide by its own regulations in effecting the removal of one of its employees. ... If the <em>Manual </em>provision to which appellant now refers us is indeed a binding regulation and if the agency has failed to comply with its mandate to the prejudice of its employee, then an essential predicate to a valid removal will have been wanting.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1032-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 280 (citations omitted). In the instant case, it is undisputed that the SSA failed to follow its own internal regulations. No attempt was made to reassign Mr. Jolly, even though the <em>Personnel Guide </em>states, unequivocally, that such an attempt \u201cshould be made.\u201d Furthermore, in light of the clear language of the regulation, and the long-standing practices pursuant to the regulation, it can hardly be contended that the <em>Personnel Guide </em>provision on reassignments is merely precatory.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> On this point, the court in <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Hampton </em>noted that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1032-11\">We of course recognize that the provision in question employs the directory \u201cshould be\u201d rather than the mandatory \u201cshall\u201d or \u201cmust\u201d, but this should not be automatically determinative of the issue .... Particularly in this instance, this superficial indicium of intent should be weighed against .. . <em>any evidence that the Commission or the agency have by their past actions created a \u201ccommon law\u201d of reassignment </em>or of granting leave-without-pay.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1032-12\"><em>Id. </em>at 281-82 (emphasis added) (citation omitted). The undisputed evidence in this case plainly reflects a past practice which has \u201ccreated a \u2018common law\u2019 of reassignment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1032-13\">In addition, if there were any real questions on this issue, they were put to rest by our decision in <em>Jolly II (see </em>APPENDIX A). As a footnote to the observation that \u201cit is possible that Jolly will be reinstated,\u201d the court in <em>Jolly II </em>stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1032-14\">We note that the SSA\u2019s own guidelines provide for an attempt to place an employee in a more suitable position if his or her performance is unsatisfactory, <em>see Doe v. Hampton, </em>566 F.2d 265 (D.C.Cir.1977).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1032-15\"><em>Id. </em>at n.1. Obviously, the only question left open in <em>Jolly II </em>was whether there was a suitable position available to accommodate Mr. Jolly, not whether the reassignment provision was mandatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"955\">*955</page-number>There is no doubt in this case that there was an available position into which Mr. Jolly could have been reassigned. In fact, Mr. Jolly sought a lateral transfer to the Operations Division of SSA and Hunter Keller, the Director of that Division, testified that he would have accepted Mr. Jolly if Mr. Listerman had acted upon the request.</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-4\">All things considered, it must be concluded that SSA\u2019s failure to reassign Mr. Jolly, in lieu of discharge, was both unlawful and further evidence of the retaliatory tactics employed by agency officials against Jolly.</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-5\">IV. THE DECISION OF THE MAJORITY IN THIS CASE RUNS DIRECTLY COUNTER TO THE DECISIONS OF THE FIFTH CIRCUIT IN PORTER I AND PORTER II</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-6\">One of the most distressing things about the majority decision in this case is that it is patently inconsistent with two related decisions recently handed down by the Fifth Circuit. <em>See Porter I </em>and <em>Porter II, supra </em>note 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-7\">The <em>Porter </em>case involves a suit brought by Ms. Ella Porter, who \u2014 like Mr. Jolly\u2014 was an employee at the Southeastern Program Center of the SSA in Birmingham, Alabama. Ms. Porter \u201cwas suspended [in June of 1975] primarily for writing and distributing a letter which, among other things, sharply criticized two of her superiors, appellees Listerman and Bruce.\u201d <em>Porter I, </em>592 F.2d at 771. The specific charges against Ms. Porter read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1033-8\">1. Writing letters to employees communicating false information which injured the reputation of management officials, lowered employee confidence in the integrity of the organization and adversely affected the efficiency of the office.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1033-9\">2. Failure to cooperate with management.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1033-10\"><em>Id. </em>at 774. Porter defended herself against these charges mainly by asserting her First Amendment right to speak and by denying certain factual assertions implicit in the charges. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1033-11\">What is particularly noteworthy about Porter\u2019s case is that she was suspended because she attempted to defend Mr. Jolly and because she, too, charged Listerman and Bruce with corrupt activities in connection with the AMWAY scheme. The decision in <em>Porter I </em>describes the factual context as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1033-12\">The center of the case against Porter and of the first charge in particular is the material she distributed to her fellow employees in 1975. Porter distributed three things in the one mailing she made. First is a letter, dated February 20, 1975, and signed by Porter appealing for \u201cfinancial and moral support\u201d for Don Jolly, a former President of the American Federation of Government Employees local in the Program Center and a former coworker of Porter\u2019s. Jolly had been fired a few months before Porter distributed her letter and, according to Porter, needed funds for the legal expenses in his appeal of his termination. Before being fired Jolly had made certain charges of conflict of interest against Listerman and Bruce, and in her letter Porter alleged appellees had had Jolly fired because of these criticisms. In addition, the letter again asserted that Listerman and Bruce were corrupt. The basis of this assertion is Listerman\u2019s and Bruce\u2019s role in AMWAY. AMWAY is a private corporation which apparently sells women\u2019s clothes and make-up and which Bruce, Listerman and other Southeastern Program Center employees work or worked for part-time. Porter accused Bruce and Listerman of using government time for AMWAY work and, more significantly, influencing their subordinates in the Program Center to join the AMWAY operation by favoring AMWAY members when making government promotion decisions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1033-13\">Similar criticisms of the AMWAY connection with the office were made to Listerman by Don Jolly in 1971, when he was president of the local of the American Federation of Government Employees. Jolly was fired in 1974, and was in the process of appealing his termination with the Civil Service Commission at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"956\">*956</page-number>time of Porter\u2019s suspension. In her letter Porter also alleged that Listerman had had Jolly fired because of his criticisms of AMWAY.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1034-4\">592 F.2d at 774-75 (footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1034-5\">In examining Ms. Porter\u2019s complaint, the Fifth Circuit astutely compared the charges against Porter and Jolly, and commented:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A3k\">[W]e note that charges two and three against Jolly are almost identical to the two charges against Porter. And we note that the two charges against Porter were initiated largely by Bruce and Listerman and were based on Porter\u2019s allegations about their role in AMWAY. Contrary to the thrust of Bruce\u2019s challenge to Porter, quoted above, it might seem that a careful reading of the official charges against Jolly, in light of the subsequent charges against Porter, would tend to confirm rather than discredit Porter\u2019s earlier suspicions about the reasons for Jolly\u2019s termination.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1034-6\"><em>Porter I, </em>592 F.2d at 776 n.10. Throughout its opinion, the Fifth Circuit noted with disfavor the pervasive roles of Listerman and Bruce in connection with the retaliatory actions against Porter and Jolly.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1034-7\">As to the Government\u2019s claim that Porter\u2019s charges against Listerman and Bruce were disruptive of agency operations, the court in <em>Porter I </em>stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1034-8\">An employee who accurately exposes rampant corruption in her office no doubt may disrupt and demoralize much of the office. But it would be absurd to hold that the First Amendment generally authorizes corrupt officials to punish subordinates who blow the whistle simply because the speech somewhat disrupted the office.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1034-9\">592 F.2d at 773.</p>\n<p id=\"b1034-10\">In its conclusion in <em>Porter I, </em>the Fifth Circuit ruled that, \u201c[t]o the extent Porter\u2019s suspension was based on [a charge of \u201cfailure to cooperate with management\u201d], the suspension was arbitrary and capricious and is hereby set aside.\u201d 592 F.2d at 784. The case was then remanded to the District Court for further proceedings on Ms. Porter\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b1034-14\">Following remand, the Administration and Porter entered settlement discussions. While discussions were underway, the Administration tendered Porter her back pay and expunged from her records any reference to the suspension. The Government then moved for summary judgment, or in the alternative, dismissal, contending that Porter had received everything to which she was entitled and that the case was thus moot. The District Court agreed and granted the motion. <em>Porter II, </em>648 F.2d at 311.</p>\n<p id=\"b1034-15\">Ms. Porter appealed the action of the District Court, and again prevailed at the Fifth Circuit. In its opinion in <em>Porter II, </em>the Fifth Circuit ruled as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1034-16\">Porter contends, here, that the case should not have been dismissed. First, she argues that the government\u2019s tender of back pay and expungement of her records did not ensure her against retaliation by her superiors; therefore, the court needed to decide issues of fact before determining that an injunction was unnecessary. Second, Porter contends that after her successful appeal, the Social Security Administration improperly denied her one and possibly two job promotions and that an award of these lost promotional opportunities is part of the relief to which she was entitled.... Porter\u2019s point that the Social Security Administration\u2019s tender did not provide her with all the relief the district court might have ordered against the agency is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"957\">*957</page-number>well taken. And since we agree with Porter that the affidavits the Administration submitted did not preclude a contest of material facts related to these issues, we must remand to allow Porter the opportunity to prove her entitlement, if any, to further relief.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1035-4\">648 F.2d at 311-12 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-5\">The critical facts to be gleaned from the opinion in Porter <em>II </em>are: (1) the Government awarded Porter back pay and agreed to expunge her records; (2) the Government abandoned the defense implicit in <em>Porter I, </em>that \u201cPorter spoke falsely, recklessly, or with malice\u201d when she accused Listerman and Bruce of corruption, <em>see Porter I, </em>592 F.2d at 777 n.10; and (3) the court explicitly recognized that Porter might need further protection against \u201cretaliation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-6\">Needless to say, it is virtually impossible to comprehend the decision of the majority in this case after reading the decisions in <em>Porter I, Porter II </em>and <em>Jolly II </em>(see APPENDIX A). The opinions of the Fifth Circuit cannot be ignored or distinguished on the grounds that Porter involved an employee other than Mr. Jolly.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Porter, as does this case, focuses on the corrupt and retaliatory acts of the same two agency officials, Mr. Listerman and Mr. Bruce, who acted against Mr. Jolly. Mr. Jolly\u2019s case prompted the suit by Ms. Porter, and the Fifth Circuit frequently refers to <em>\u201cthe connection between Porter\u2019s speech and Jolly\u2019s litigation of his own constitutional rights.\u201d Porter I, </em>592 F.2d at 780.</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-7\">It is somewhat of an embarrassment that the lawless acts of the same Government officials have been so easily recognized and dealt with by the Fifth Circuit, and so totally ignored by the majority in this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-8\">Y. SSA\u2019s DISCHARGE OF MR. JOLLY WAS ARBITRARY AND MUST, THEREFORE, BE REVERSED</p>\n<p id=\"A3u\">As has been demonstrated above, the evidence is clear that the first and only real reasons for the discharge of Mr. Jolly were his resignation from the Staff Development Program and his publication of the Newsletter exposing the AM WAY scheme. Numerous other reasons were offered at various times, as the Government sought to alter the charges against Mr. Jolly, but these <em>post hoc </em>rationalizations were plainly pretextual.</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-11\">The evidence of retaliation and pretext is so clear that it will serve no useful purpose to repeat what has already been set forth in detail above. Under whatever test the majority seeks to employ \u2014 \u201carbitrary and capricious,\u201d \u201crational basis,\u201d \u201cabuse of discretion,\u201d \u201csubstantial evidence,\u201d or \u201cpromoting the efficiency of the service,\u201d majority dp. at 943 n.27 \u2014 the Government cannot prevail in this case. Although the scope of review may be narrow,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AiE\">a reviewing court does not serve as a mere rubber stamp for agency decisions. Rather the function of judicial review is to ensure that agency decisions are \u201cbased on consideration of the relevant factors.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1035-12\"><em>Lead Industries Association v. Environmental Protection Agency, </em>647 F.2d 1130, 1145 (D.C.Cir.1980) (quoting from <em>Citizens to Preserve Overton Park, Inc. v. Volpe, </em>401 U.S. 402, 416, 91 S.Ct. 814, 823, 28 L.Ed.2d 136 (1971)). To follow any other approach \u201cwould render the appellate process a superfluous. (although time-consuming) ritual.\u201d <em>Ethyl Corp. v. Environmental Protection Agency, </em>541 F.2d 1, 34 (D.C.Cir.)

It is equally clear that these true reasons cannot <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"958\">*958</page-number>be used to justify the retaliatory action taken against Mr. Jolly, <em>see Porter I and Porter II, supra, </em>note 1; therefore, the judgment of the District Court should be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-4\">VI. POSTSCRIPT</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-5\">Unlike the majority, I cannot so easily dismiss the First Amendment considerations underlying this case. The evidence here shows that Jolly was retaliated against because he \u201cblew the whistle\u201d on corrupt supervisors by publishing the Newsletter. In this court\u2019s decision in <em>Jolly II, see </em>APPENDIX A, the panel recognized \u201cthe difficult constitutional issue raised by Jolly,\u201d but found it unnecessary to decide the question because of the strong suggestion \u201cthat Jolly [would] be reinstated\u201d on other grounds.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1036-6\">The opinion of the Fifth Circuit in <em>Porter I, supra </em>note 1, is even more clear on the point relating to the First Amendment issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1036-7\">An employee who accurately exposes rampant corruption in [his] office no doubt may disrupt and demoralize much of the office. <em>But it would be absurd to hold that the First Amendment generally authorizes corrupt officials to punish subordinates who blow the whistle because the speech somewhat disrupted the office.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AEQ\">592 F.2d 773 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-8\">The Government has, in this case, attempted to sweep the issue under the rug by dropping charges 2d. and 3 (pertaining to the Newsletter)<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> from the list of accusations leveled against Mr. Jolly. The modification of the charges, however, did not change the fact that the real reason for Mr. Jolly\u2019s discharge had to do with his publication of the Newsletter. In other words, the First Amendment issue that this court recognized in <em>Jolly II, </em>and the Fifth Circuit recognized in <em>Porter, </em>did not disappear merely because of a change in Government pleadings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-10\">I find it unnecessary to pursue the First Amendment question, however, in part because the parties have framed the issues differently on this appeal, and in part because \u2014 as we said in <em>Jolly II </em>\u2014 there is no occasion here to decide the constitutional issue. As I believe the court assumed in <em>Jolly II, </em>the Government actions have been so outrageous and lawless on several counts, one need look no further than the \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d standard to justify Mr. Jolly\u2019s reinstatement in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-11\">APPENDIX A</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-12\">UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-13\">No. 78-1750</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-14\">DONALD G. JOLLY, APPELLANT v. E. J. LISTERMAN, Regional Representative, Bureau of Retirement and Survivors, et al.</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-16\">Appeal from the United States District Court of the District of Columbia.</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-17\">Before McGOWAN, MacKINNON and WALD, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-18\">Filed December 6, 1979</p>\n<p id=\"Ale\">MEMORANDUM</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-19\">The plaintiff Jolly was discharged from his position with the Social Security Administration after fourteen years of service. His discharge was based upon alleged (1) poor work performance during several months immediately preceding his termination, (2) failure to cooperate with his supervisors based in part on his refusal to answer questions about a union publication which had printed articles critical of his supervisors, and (3) creating an adverse employee-employer atmosphere by publishing the newsletter.</p>\n<p id=\"A4z\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"959\">*959</page-number>The final charge, and some of the allegations in support of the second charge, were rejected as grounds for dismissal by the Civil Service Commission in the course of Jolly\u2019s appeal, but his dismissal was upheld by both the CSC and the district court. Jolly\u2019s principal argument on this appeal is that it is a violation of his First Amendment rights of free speech and association to rely as a ground for dismissal on his refusal to answer questions about his publication, particularly when one of his questioners was a supervisor he had criticized in his publication. He also contends that the case should be remanded to the Social Security Administration for reconsideration of the penalty in light of the reduced charges against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-5\">In this case, Jolly\u2019s original dismissal was expressly based upon \u201call\u201d of the charges in his supervisor\u2019s letter, but the ultimate affirmance by the CSC of his dismissal, as stated above, was not on all the charges. When a public employee is dismissed, and some of the grounds for termination are later held to be improper, this court has held that if it is unclear whether the charges were deemed by the agency to constitute separate or cumulative grounds for discharge, the case should be remanded to the agency for reconsideration of the propriety of the punishment imposed. <em>Meehan </em>v. Macy, 392 F.2d 822, <em>aff\u2019d on rehearing, </em>425 F.2d 469, <em>aff\u2019d en banc, </em>425 F.2d 472 (D.C.Cir.1968). This is true whether the improper charges have been dismissed by this court, as in <em>Meehan, </em>or by the Civil Service Commission, as in <em>Slowick </em>v. <em>Hampton, </em>470 F.2d 467 (D.C.Cir.1972), and is particularly important where the grounds for dismissal which are upheld are less flagrant than those which have been rejected. In either case, the plaintiff\u2019s employer agency should be given the opportunity to reconsider the exercise of its discretion to devise an appropriate penalty for its employee\u2019s misconduct, if any, in light of the changed circumstances. Therefore the cause must be remanded to the SSA in any event, and since it is possible that Jolly will be reinstated <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> or otherwise satisfied if the SSA is given an opportunity to reconsider, it is unnecessary for us to decide the difficult constitutional issue raised by Jolly on appeal. We conclude that the wisest course now is to remand to his employer agency for further consideration of the propriety of Jolly\u2019s dismissal, in light of the reduced charges, expressing no view on the constitutional issue raised here as to his questioning regarding his relationship to the publication.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1026-8\">. <em>See Porter v.
