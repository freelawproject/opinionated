End. of Law, </em>750, it is said, as supported by authority, \u201cThe circumstances, when reviewed together, must be incompatible with innocence, and if reasonably capable of two interpretations, that interpretation which favors innocence will he adopted, hut guilt will he inferred where it is impossible to reconcile the testimony with any theory of innocence. The evidence must he complete, satisfactory and convincing, and consistent, with the hypothesis that the adultery was committed.\u201d 11 <em>Cyc. </em>681; <em>Shufeldt </em>v. <em>Shufeldt. </em>86 Md. 528; <em>Rasch v. Rasch, </em>105 <em>Md. </em>506; <em>Loveden </em>v. <em>Loveden., </em>4 Eng. Ecc. 161.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-10\">The parties to this controversy were married on the 12th day of May, 1901, in Baltimore Oity, and they lived together as husband and wife until the i 1th day of January, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>1921, when she left his home, and she has lived apart from her husband since that date.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">The specific charge relied upon by the plaintiff for the relief sought by the bill, is adultery with the woman named, between January 1st, 1920, and January 11th, 1921.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-6\">The proof shows that Dr. McCleary, the defendant, is a prominent physician in the City of Baltimore, in active practice, and engaged professionally at the Baltimore City College of Dental Surgery, at Mercy Hospital, and at the University of Maryland.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-7\">Dr. Lockwood, who was associated with the defendant at the Mercy Hospital, Baltimore, testified that he had known Dr. McCleary professionally for over twenty-five years, that he was particularly active in his profession, was recognized as very efficient in his work, and was relied upon by others as an authority upon pathological work.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-8\">Dr. Heck testified that he had known Dr. McCleary for a number of years, and that he had always found him to be an upright man and a man of high character, that he had taught him at school and he regarded him as trustworthy, a fine gentleman and a good doctor.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-9\">The testimony also shows that the alleged adulteress was a patient of Dr. McCleary, and was under treatment by him for syphilis. She was also treated by Drs. Simon, Judd and Heck for the same disease. Some of the tests proved positive and others negative. There were three or four treatments with salversan by Drs. Judd and McCleary, in the latter\u2019s office, and it was after one of these treatments, which left her unfit to walk- home, that the defendant drove her home in his automobile.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-10\">The charges of adultery, in this case, it will be seen, are sought to be established by the testimony of the wife, the daughter, and cei\u2019tain detectives employed by the wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-11\">There is no- positive or direct testimony in the case of the fact that adultery was committed, but the court is asked to infer, from certain circumstances set out in the record, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>the parties were guilty as charged. The proof is entirely circumstantial and does not measure up to the kind of evidence that leads to the conclusion of guilt, by a fair inference from it, or such proof as is required, under the authorities, to show that the parties were guilty of committing adultery.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">The testimony of the defendant and the alleged adulteress is set out in the record, and they both positively deny the commission of any act of adultery, and they also deny the existence between them of anything more than the relation of doctor and patient.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-6\">The testimony of the wife is based entirely upon alleged telephone calls and of meetings between the defendant and the alleged adulteress outside of his office, and of rides with him in his automobile in broad daylight, it rests entirely in suspicion and jealousy, and it does not in any way support the charge of adultery set out in the bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-7\">The testimony of the detectives is unreliable and does not connect the defendant with the offense, ft is not corroborated by any circumstance in tbe ease, and is therefore entitled to but little weight in the determination of the case. <em>Marshall </em>v. <em>Marshall, </em>122 Md. 694 ; <em>German </em>v. <em>German, </em>137 Md. 438 ; <em>Robins </em>v. <em>Robins, </em>121 Md. 695.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-8\">The testimony of the little daughter, Anna McOleary, who-was only thirteen years of age and who had been left at home on the afternoon of December 25th, 1920, to watch and to act as spy on her father, is unreliable and not supported by proper proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-9\">In 9 /&gt;'. <em>G. Law, </em>section 105, it is said: \u201cIn view of the impropriety of calling children of tender age to testify against their mother to establish an offense, against her chastity, and \u2022 since the testimony of such children to acts which will naturally be construed by their prepossessions and immature and incorrect notions is of slight value, it has been held that a divorce should not be granted to the husband for the adrrltery of the wife upon the sole testimony of young children of the parties. The plaintiff must, of course; prove the acts of adultery charged.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b690-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>But apart from this, the daughter\u2019s testimony is contradicted by the positive evidence of both the defendant and the alleged adulteress, that they did not go in the defendant\u2019s bed room at the time stated by the daughter, nor at any other time. It is admitted that they went to his library and there lie played a record for her. It was a habit and custom of Dr. McOleary to take his patients and visitors to this room for musical entertainment, and this fact was well known to the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">While the testimony of detectives and spies is competent, the law is well settled that it should be scrutinized carefully and should not be relied upon unless it is corroborated.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-6\">Another circumstance which reflects upon the improbability of the testimony as to sexual intimacy between the defendant and the woman named is the fact that during the time testified to by the witnesses, she was being treated for syphilis, and it would have been very dangerous for any one to have sexual intercourse with her.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-7\">In <em>Hurtzig </em>v. <em>Hurtzig, </em>44 N. J. Eq. 329, the Chancellor, in dealing with the question of precautionary tests, in cases of adultery, said that to establish adultery the circumstances must be such as to lead the guarded discretion of a reasonable and just man to the conclusion of guilt. The judgment must not be rash, moving upon appearances that are equally capable of two interpretations. If the circumstances, taken both singly and together, reasonably admit of two interpretations, that interpretation which favors innocence should be adopted.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-8\">Mr. Jones, in his work on <em>Evidence, </em>sec. 195, thus states the rule, as supported by authority, that when fraud or criminal conduct is imputed, the decisions are to the effect that something more than a mere preponderance of evidence must be produced and that the proof must be clear and satisfactory. 14 <em>Cyc., </em>681-684; 9 <em>Ruling Case Law, </em>secs. 105, 106.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-9\">In view of the clear and controlling decisions of this Oourt upon the burden of proof required in cases of this kind, wc think no useful purpose would be served by a further discussion of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>Reviewing all of the facts and circumstances disclosed by the record in this case, wo are unable to hold that the testi mony is sufficient to support a conviction of the defendant, and to establish adulterous relations and intercourse between the parties accused.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">As this view disposes of the case, we find it unnecessary to discuss the testimony in detail or to further set it out in this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-6\">Bor the reasons stated, the decree of Circuit Court No. 2 of Baltimore City, dated the 14th day of November, 1921, must be reversed, and the plaintiff\u2019s bill will be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-7\">\n<em>Decree reversed, bill dismissed, the costs in this Court, and in the court below, lo be paid by the defendant, Standish McCleary.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
