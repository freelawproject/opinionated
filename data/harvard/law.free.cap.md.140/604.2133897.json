Tt appears from the testimony that the rules of the establishment required the clerks, after making sales, to wrap up the merchandise sold and receive the money for it, before handing it to the customer, and then take the money to the cash register, ring it up, take the receipt or slip from the register, wrap it up with the merchandise, and then hand the parcel to the customer. There is a conflict of testimony as to whether appellee had been instructed in these rules, but she testifies that her practice was to do these things because she saw the other girls doing them. On this occasion, she says, she put the money in her pocket, because a lady was waiting for her to show her goods, and she did not stop to go to the cash register, intending to do so after waiting on the customer; that before she had time to do so she was sent for by appellant to go to his office on the third floor.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-7\">Eleisher testified that Hoffman, the manager of the first floor, came in right after the sale of the nets and the deposit of the money by Miss Ensminger in her pocket, and he told Hoffman to watch her pretty close and see if she would ring up the money before he called her to his office; that Miss Ensminger passed the cash register several times while he was talking to Hoffman, and before he left she passed over to the left and was folding some veils; that he then went to the second floor and from there to his office on the third floor and told the operator to call her to his office, and that she came in response to the call.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>Miss Ensminger\u2019s account of the call to Fleisher\u2019s office and the subsequent occurrences was as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">That after Mrs. Heckert, the customer to whom she went after selling the nets, left the store, Robert Chatkins, an employee, told her Fleisher -wanted to see her on the third floor and she said \u201call right,\u201d and she and Ohatkins started <em>to the </em>elevator; that she had started for the register to ring\u2019 up the twenty cents; that both of them went up in the elevator to the third floor; \u201cwe got off and he took me back to Mr. Fleisher\u2019s office, and on the way back to the elevator, I saw Mr. Marks .coming through there on the first floor \u2014 he was getting the money from the registers and I said 'why, there is Mr. Marks now,\u2019 and he said, 'He will be up after awhile,\u2019 or something like that. We went on up and he took me back to Mr. Fleisher\u2019s office and he said \u2018here she is,\u2019 as he opened the door, and Mr. Fleisher said, 'tell her to come in.\u2019 I went in and he closed the door behind me, and Mr. Fleisher and Mr. Monday were in there.\u201d Monday, it appears, was janitor of the building and general utility man.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">Continuing, the witness said: \u201cMr. Fleisher, as soon as I got in the door he said, 'Miss Ensminger, how much money have you got in that pocket ?\u2019 I said, 'one dollar and twenty cents; the twenty cents is yours and the dollar is mine.\u2019 And then I started to tell him about where I got the twenty cents and the dollar and everything. I would go to say he would call me a liar and a thief. And then I told him that the twenty cents was for hair nets and the dollar was money that mother had given me to buy ribbons for the children. It was close to field day, and they had to have the ribbon for Monday morning, and I could hardly tell him, he kept hollering at me so loud and then calling me a damn liar and everything else. He called me a bastard and most everything else lie could think of, and he asked me who my girl friends were, and I told him Miss Mower and Miss Darby, and he said, \u201cDo they steal and lie like you do ?\u201d And I wanted to say no, and he kept hollering at me that I was a thief and every<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>thing like that, and he asked me what church I went to and I told him St. John\u2019s, and he asked me who my pastor was, and I said Reverend Harms, and he asked me how often I went to Sunday school and I said \u2018most every Sunday.\u2019 I said, \u2018unless I am sick.\u2019 Then he asked me what kind of hose I had on and I told him lisle. He said, \u2018let me see,\u2019 and sort of leaned over his desk to see, and then said \u2018you stole them and you have been stealing\u2019 hose all along. How many pair of hose have you up home that you stole from me ?\u2019 and I said, \u2018I haven\u2019t any,\u2019 but he kept saying I was a thief and asked me what else I had up home that I had stolen from him, and I. told him \u2018nothing,\u2019 and he kept on calling me a thief. Then ho asked me if I had a pocketbook, and I told him, \u2018in my locker.\u2019 He asked me for my key and I told him that I had lost the key or mislaid it at home. I said I didn\u2019t know just where it was, so he asked Mr. Monday to go down and get my pocketbook, and Mr. Monday told him he would not go unless I went along. So he told me to go down with Mr. Monday, and we went down to the first floor on the elevator, and then we had to go down in the cellar like to the lockers, and Mr. Monday went along down with me and I got the pocketbook out of the locker, and he and I went upstairs on the elevator and we went to Mr. Fleisher\u2019s office, and I handed the pocketbook to Mi\u2019. Fleisher and he opened it and I had $6.21, and there was another piece of paper with a verse on it on one side and my sister\u2019s name on the other, and lie looked at that and he said, \u2018you stole this money, too,\u2019 and he asked me where I got the money and I told him that it was my pay for that week, what I had left \u25a0of pay when we was paid on Friday night. * * * While we were down stairs, Mr. Fleisher had taken the $1.20 that I had in my pocket into Mr. Sack\u2019s office \u2014 that was another manager \u2014 so he went over there and got the $1.20, and he gave me the twenty cents and he said to take it down and ring it up on the cash register, and he said \u2018here is the dollar, it isn\u2019t yours, but I will give it to you,\u2019 and T said, \u2018all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>right\u2019 and he said, <em>\u2018go </em>over in the lavatory in the alteration room and wash your face and don\u2019t tell anybody anything about it. Just go down and ring up the money and fix up your slips.\u2019 Then he asked me if I was coming back on Monday morning, and I said I didn\u2019t know.\u201d She further testified, that Eleisher said to her in his office, \u201cDo you know what I could do with yon ? I could have you arrested.\u201d That it was over a half hour from the time she went to Eleisher\u2019s office until he said, \u201cnow you can go\u201d; that while she was in the office she was crying; that she was scared and afraid she would be arrested or \u201csomething like that\u201d; that Monday was standing over at the radiator at the side of the room when she first went up; that when she came back after getting the pocketbook, he stood at the door and that the door was closed by him. In answer to the question why she stayed in Eleisher\u2019s office, she said, \u201cBecause I had to.\u201d \u201cQ. Why did you think you had to stay there? A. Because I was afraid to leave. He told me I was a liar and a thief and he told me he could arrest me and I was afraid to leave. Q. Why? A. I was afraid he would arrest me.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">On cross-examination she said, when she was told that Fleischer wanted to see her in his office, she was willing to go to see what he wanted, and was satisfied to explain that she did not do what she was accused of doing. \u201cI thought that if I would go he would have me arrested or something else. I don\u2019t know what he would do.\u201d In answer to the question whether she was satisfied to go down and get her pocketbook from her locker, she said, \u201cWell, I was satisfied to go, but he had to tell me to go. He did tell me to go. He had ordered me to go.\u201d \u201cQ. Did he tell you to go and were you satisfied to go ? A. Hnder his orders I was. That is, I wanted to get the pocketbook to prove to him. Q. You were anxious to show him that you hadn\u2019t done what he accused you of doing? A. Yes, I wanted to show him. I was afraid if I didn\u2019t. He had told me he could have me arrested. Q. Did he tell you that before or afterwards ? A. It must have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>been before, because that was my intention. That is the reason I went. Q. Yon wanted Mr. Eleishor to see just what money you had down in your locker ? A. Yes, sir. Q. You' how far down did Mr. Monday go with you? A. lie went clear down to the locker.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">She had previously testified that she did not remember whether it was before or after she went to get her pocket-hook that Eleisher told her he could have her arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">The plaintiff was corroborated by other witnesses as to much of the abusive language which she testified was used toward her by the defendant, all of which was denied by the defendant and several other witnesses. The plaintiff alone testified that defendant said he conld have her arrested. Her other witnesses did not hear this; and defendant, and others testifying in his behalf, positively denied that anything of this kind was said. It also appears that a <em>non pros </em>of another suit was taken by the plaintiff when the court was about to direct a verdict for the defendant because of the absence of any such testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-7\">This appeal is from a judgment in favor of the plaintiff. There are three bills of exception in the record. The first and second are to rulings of the court on testimony and are clearly unimportant. It is sufficient to say as to them that we find no error in those rulings. The testimony admitted over objections tended to show how the plaintiff came by part of the money which was in her pocket at the time the investigation was made by defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-8\">The third is to the granting of plaintiff\u2019s first, second, third, and fourth prayers and to the overruling of defendant\u2019s special exception to plaintiff\u2019s second prayer; and to the rejection of defendant\u2019s first, second, third, and seventh prayers, and to the modification of defendant\u2019s fourth and sixth prayers.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-9\">The <em>Reporter </em>will set out all the prayers of defendant, and the granted prayers of the plaintiff, and defendant\u2019s special exception to plaintiff\u2019s second prayer.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>Defendant, by bis first prayer, sought to have the case withdrawn from the jury on the ground that under the pleadings there was no evidence legally sufficient to entitle the plaintiff to recover.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">Any deprivation of the liberty of another without his consent, whether by violence, threats or otherwise, constitutes an imprisonment. <em>Bernheimer </em>v. <em>Becker, </em>102 Md. 254.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">And if this is done unlawfully, it is false imprisonment, without regard to whether it is done with or without probable cause. <em>Lewin </em>v. <em>Uzeber, </em>65 Md. 341.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-7\">That being the law, we cannot say that there was no evidence in this case to go to the jury. Its weight, of course, was for them. The prayer was therefore properly refused.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-8\">His third prayer is not in a form which we could approve, and, even if otherwise unobjectionable, was calculated to confuse or mislead the jury. His seventh prayer was misleading without proper qualification.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-9\">Plaintiff\u2019s first prayer correctly defines \u201cimprisonment\u201d and is unobjectionable. <em>Bernheimer </em>v. <em>Becker, supra,.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b646-10\">Her third prayer presents the case fairly to the jury and requires the finding of every fact necessary to recovery. It was therefore properly granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-11\">Her fourth prayer is correct as a legal proposition, and was not specially excepted to.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-12\">We find no substantial objection to the court\u2019s modification of defendant\u2019s fourth and sixth prayers. As offered, the fourth denied the right of recovery if the jury should believe from the evidence that defendant was satisfied and willing to come to and remain at defendant\u2019s office, and to go to the cloak room and get her pocketbook, and then to return and remain at the office. The addendum merely told the jury that such satisfaction and willingness alone were not sufficient to defeat recovery if they were produced by the belief that if she did not do any of these things she would be arrested or force would be used. The modification simply qualifies the prayer as to the one proposition contained in it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>as offered. The majority of the court does not find that the prayer as modified was misleading when considered in connection with the other granted prayers.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">His sixth prayer as modified simply told the jury that the facts set out in the original prayer were not <em>alone </em>sufficient to defeat recovery, if the detention or restraint of the defendant was accomplished by force or show of force. If there was any tendency in this prayer to mislead', it was cured by the granting of defendant\u2019s eighth and ninth pray ers.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">It remains to consider plaintiff\u2019s second and defendant\u2019s second prayers.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-7\">The special exception to plaintiff\u2019s second prayer was properly overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-8\">The majority of the court holds that the omission from this prayer of any specific reference to the alleged threat of the defendant, implied from his alleged statement to the plaintiff \u201cthat he could have her arrested,\u201d and the rejection of defendant\u2019s second prayer, which specifically instructed the jury that the finding that defendant made such statement was necessary to recovery, were not prejudicial errors, in view of the full and fair presentation of the law as applicable to all the facts of the case in plaintiff\u2019s third prayer and in defendant\u2019s eighth and ninth prayers.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-9\">The majority of the court finding no prejudicial error in any of the rulings excepted to, the judgment will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-10\"><em>Judgmeni </em>affirmed, <em>wilh costs to appellee.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
