Duvall, 54 Md. 350; <em>Rowe </em>v. <em>Balto. </em>&amp; <em>O. R. R. Co., </em>82 Md. 493 ; <em>Anne Arundel Co. </em>v. <em>Carr, </em>111 Md. 150), and says in its brief: \u201cIt is submitted that the only way the appellant can he held liable fox* damages resulting from the accident is that- the limb or the tree from xvhich the limb fell was defective and in a dangerous condition, and that the \u2022County Commissioners, their agents or employees, charged with the duty of maintaining the roads and highways of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>Comity, in repair and in safe condition, had knowledge of such dangerous condition, or by the exercise of reasonable care could have known of said condition.\u201d The ground of the defendant\u2019s appeal is that there is no evidence in the case to showr that the defendant knew of the. dangerous condition of the limb or tree, or by the exercise of reasonable care could have known of such dangerous condition in time to have prevented the accident, and that there was, therefore, error in the granting of the plaintiff\u2019s first and second prayers, and in the rejection of its first prayer, by wbieb it asked the court to direct a verdict for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-4\">Evidence was offered at the trial tending to show that the tree in question was old, and stood from fifteen to twenty-six feet from the center of the highway; that at.the distance of from six to seven feet from the ground the trunk of the tree \u201cbranched out\u201d into three large limbs or branches, one of which, and the one that fell on the plaintiffs car, was about sixty or seventy feet high and extended across the highway ; that this limb or branch was about twenty-four inches in diameter at the butt, and that at the point, of the trunk where the limb gave way the trunk and limb were decayed; that near the crotch of the tree, or the point where, the trunk of the tree divided and on the side of the trunk next to the highway there were several large knot holes, about six inchs in diameter, and other evidences of decay; that there were also two large cracks in the trunk of the tree, about six inches deep and extending from the crotch nearly to the ground, and that one of these cracks Was on the side next to the road; that that condition of the free had existed for some time before the accident, and that, at the time the limb gave way and fell across the highway, striking the plaintiff\u2019s automobile and causing the injury complained of, there was no storm and only a moderate wind.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">The burden was on the plaintiff to show that the injury complained of was caused by the defendant\u2019s negligence, and the court below so instructed the jury. But with such evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>dence in the case as we have referred to, it was clearly for the jury to determine whether the accident was dne to the decayed condition of the limb or tree, and whether the defendant knew, .or by the exercise of reasonable care could have known, of such dangerous condition in time to have prevented the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\">In 1887, Judge Miller had occasion to repeat the rule that is established in this State, and one that should be carefully observed by the trial court. He said, quoting from <em>Metropolitan Railway Co. </em>v. Jackson, 3 App. Cases, 197: \u201cThe judge has a certain duty to discharge, and the jurors have another and a different duty. The judge has to say whether any facts have been established by evidence from which negligence may be reasonably inferred; the jurors have to say whether from these facts, when submitted to them, negligence ought to be inferred, and it is of the greatest importance in the administration of justice that these separate functions should be maintained, and should be maintained distinct. It would be a serious inroad on the province of the jury, if, in a case where there are facts from which negligence may be reasonably inferred, the judge were to withdraw the case from the jury upon the ground that, in his opinion, negligence ought not to be inferred; and it would, on the other hand, place in the hands of the jurors a power which might be exercised in the most arbitrary manner, if they were at liberty to hold that negligence might be inferred from any state of facts whatever.\u201d <em>Phila., W. &amp; B. R. R. Co. </em>v. <em>Pronk, </em>67 Md. 339. Where a large branch or limb of an old tree, bearing such marks or evidences of decay and extending over a public highway in such a position as to render travel thereon dangerous, is allowed to remain in that position for a long time, the court would not be justified in instructing the jury that there is no evidence of negligence on the part of those specially charged with the duty of keeping the highway \u201csafe for the travel of the public.\u201d <em>Keen </em>v. <em>Havre de Grace, </em>93 Md. 34.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>The defendant\u2019s first exception was to the refusal of the court below to direct a verdict for the defendant at the close of the plaintiff\u2019s evidence. The prayer was properly refused' for the reasons we have stated in reference to its first prayer offered at the conclusion of the whole evidence, and the exception was, moreover, waived by the defendant by proceeding with its own evidence. <em>Balto. Car Wheel Co. </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>131 Md. 513.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-4\">The second exception was to the refusal of the court to-strike out the testimony of the witness Harry Fleigh. As no-exception was taken to this evidence at the time if was admitted, and it was not admitted subject to exceptions, the exception was too late. <em>North Bros. </em>v. <em>Mallory, </em>94 Md. 305. Moreover, the motion applied to all of the testimony of the witness, some of which was clearly admissible for the purpose of showing the condition of the plaintiff\u2019s car after the accident, and the motion was, therefore, too general. <em>United Rys. Co. </em>v. <em>Wehr, </em>103 Md. 323; <em>Balto. &amp; O. R. Co. </em>v. <em>Whitehill, </em>104 Md. 295.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">The only objection urged to plaintiff\u2019s first and second prayers is the one raised by defendant\u2019s first prayer, which, for the reasons we have stated, was properly rejected, and as we find no error in the rulings of the court below, the judgment will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed, with costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
