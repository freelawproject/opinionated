And this is the real question presented in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-7\">A thing can hardly be said to bo a secret, in the sense that it should be guarded by a court of equity, which is susceptible of discovery by observation, and which is open to the observation of any one who thinks it worth while to observe;.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-8\">In this case it was not necessary for the new employer of appellee to seek his services in order to obtain the names of appellant\u2019s customers whom appellee served. He could obtain this information by tbe simple process of observing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>each day for a week where he stopped on his daily rounds. We have no difficulty in reaching the conclusion that there is no trade secret involved in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">We have been referred to several California, decisions- and to two decisions by the intermediate court of New York, and to an English case, which support the view contended for by appellant. <em>Empire Steam Laundry </em>v. <em>Lozier, 165 </em>Cal. 95; <em>Lamb v. Evans, </em>L. R. (1893), 1 Ch. Div. 218; <em>People\u2019s Supply Company </em>v. <em>Light, </em>157 N. Y. Supp. 15; <em>Witkop </em>v. <em>Boyce, </em>112 N. Y. Supp. 874;. <em>Cornish </em>v. <em>Dickey, </em>172 Cal. 120. That view is also supported by <em>Dims, Unfair Competition, </em>sec. 222. But while we do- not decide that there might not be cases in whiph an employer should be protected from the use by an employee of a list of customers, fraudulently and surreptitiously obtained, or where, in the nature of the particular case,- or by reason of the care used-in concealing them, the names of customers are so guarded as not to- be easily obtainable by. others than confidential employees, we are no-t willing to hold that in any ordinary business an employee, on going into business for hinjself or into the employ of another, should be enjoined from seeking to do business -with friends he has made in the course of a previous employment, merely because, he became acquainted w.ith them while so- engaged and as a result of such previous employment. Under, such a rule, a ' travelling salesman, every time he changed employers, if in a like business, would be compelled to give up- all the friends and business acquaintances made during the previous employment. Such a rule would tend to destroy the freedom of employees:and to reduce them to a condition of industrial servitude. See <em>Wm. Rogers Mfg. Co., </em>v. <em>Rogers, </em>58 Conn. 356; <em>Stein </em>v. <em>National Life Association, </em>105 Ga. 82, 46 L. R. A. 150; <em>American Specialty Co. v. Collis Co., </em>235 Fed. at 935.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">\u2022It is a significant fact'that very few cases are to be'.found on either side of this proposition.' That would seem to. indicate that few attempts, have been made by employers to invoke the principle contended for.by appellant. ... -</p>\n<p id=\"b389-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>Of course, there is nothing to prevent an employer from expressly contracting with his employee that the latter shall not, on leaving the employer\u2019s service, solicit business in the same line from the customers of the employer in a particular territory, and, if by reason of the nature of the laundry business such protection is necessary, it can easily be secured by such contracts.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-4\">While the case of <em>Rosenstein </em>v. <em>Zenlz, </em>118 Md. 564, was decided on other grounds and on a different state of facts, what was said in that case, at page 575, reflects somewhat the views of the Court on the principle involved in the present case, especially in regard to the right to profit by the influence and standing which a capable and gentlemanly employee establishes with the customers with whom he comes in contact.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">\n<em>Order affirmed, with costs to appellee.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">Judge Offutt dissents.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
