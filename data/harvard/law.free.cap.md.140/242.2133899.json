Karupkat, the owners of the property, dated September 30, 191!), and designated, as an \u201cExclusive Bight of Sale.\u201d It is filed in the case, part of \u201cPlaintiff\u2019s Exhibit A,\u201d and is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-18\">\u201cExclusive Bight of Sale.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-19\">\u201cIn consideration of the special advertising and listing of said property by William Luebbers, we hereby <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>agree to pay him. 10 per centum o\u00a3 the sale price on any sale of the above property made within (6) months from the date hereof.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-5\">\u201cIt is agreed that this contract is to continue in effect after said period and until thirty days\u2019 previous notice of such termination be given by ns.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-6\">\u201cAs witness our hands this 30th day of Sept.,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-7\">1919.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-8\">\u201cA. Korupkat,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-9\">\u201cEmilie Korupkat,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-10\">\u201cOwners.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b270-11\">The relief sought by the plaintiff, as stated by the prayer of the hill, is, that the agreement, marked \u201cPlaintiff\u2019s Exhibit B\u201d may he enforced, and that the defendants may he decreed to convey unto the plaintiff the property mentioned, in the contract, upon the payment of the balance of the purchase money still due and owing by him.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-12\">The defendants in their answer deny the material allegations of the hill and aver (1) that the contract of sale sought to be enforced was not a valid contract binding upon the defendants, but was null and void and without legal effect. Second: Assuming the validity of the original agreement, they deny that the agency was in force and operation at the lime of the alleged sale to the plaintiff, because, they aver, the same had wholly ceased and expired both by limitation and revocation; that the alleged agreement of sale was not made at the time stated and the sale was not a valid or bona fide transaction, and third, they further aver, that the plaintiff was without authority, to make, a valid contract of sale, as their agent, on the 28th of EToveamber, 1919, of the- property in question, because he had been fully advised by \u25a0 them of the revocation of the alleged agency, before the contract of sale had been made by him with the appellee as' set out in the record now before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-13\">The case was heard upon hill, answers and testimony, taken in open court, and from a decree of the Circuit Court for A\u00fane Arundel Comity, dated the 28th day of July, 1921. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>granting the relief sought by the hill, and directing a conveyance by the defendants to the plaintiff of the property in question, this appeal has been taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">The rule of law now in force in this State, and controlling on this appeal, has been settled by this Court and need only to he stated, to reach a proper conclusion on the record now before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">In <em>Brown v. Hogan, </em>138 Md. 268, Chief Judge Boyd very carefully and at length reviews the oases in other jurisdictions and in this Court on this subject, and says, that the very decided weight of authority is, that one employed to find a purchaser for land, or to sell land, has, in the absence of express authority to that effect, no power to sign a contract of sale. And it was turther said, it is much better for everybody that it be clearly and unequivocally stated in the contract of employment with his principal and that the terms of sale be made explicit, if the agent is to have authority to make a contract of sale, and if such authority is not given him,'then the sale must he reported to the owner and the contract executed by him, if one is desired.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-7\">In <em>Clark v. Peoples Bank, </em>136 Md. 263, it wras held that authority to lease a piece of property, and to find a purchaser therefor, did not confer on the agent power to give an option to'purchase, or to execute a written contract of sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-8\">In 31 <em>Cyc. </em>1366, it is stated, as supported hv authority, that the mere employment of a real estate broker to find a purchaser of land on terms fixed by the owner does not include authority to execute a contract binding upon his principal. ' '</p>\n<p id=\"b271-9\">We have carefully examined the testimony disclosed by the record in this case, and we are unable to hold that the alleged contract of sale, relied upon by the appellee, is established by that clear and satisfactory proof which is always required to warrant a decree for specific performance.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-10\">The alleged contract sought to be enforced is merely au office memorandum, signed only by the appellants, and it confers no express authority upon the agent to make or sign <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>a written contract for tlie principal. There is nothing in the surrounding circumstances of the case from which such authority could be fairly or reasonably implied.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">In <em>Spengler </em>v. <em>Sonnenberg, </em>88 Ohio St. 192, tlie Supreme Court of Ohio said: \u201cIt is the settled law of this state that a real estate agent is without authority to execute a contract of sale which shall he binding on one who places real estate in his hands for sale, unless such authority is specially conferred. * * * The fact that the owner of real estate employs an agent to find a purchaser for it does not raise an implication that the agent is authorized to make a written contract with reference to it. * * * If the agent assumes to make a contract in excess of this authority, the agreement is void and unenforceable.\u201d <em>Crumpacker </em>v. <em>Jeffrey, </em>63 Ind. App. <em>621; Clark </em>v. <em>People's Bank, </em>136 Md. 276; <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Hogan, </em>138 Md. 268.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">But apart from the fact that the agent, in this case, was without authority to make a valid contract which could he specifically enforced against these defendants, the evidence clearly shows that the written memorandum to sell was revoked and cancelled by the defendants before the sale to the plaintiff was made, and the agent was not, therefore, authorized to make the sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-7\">The witness, A. Karupkat, testified that he visited the office of Mr. Luebber on the 24th of October, 1919, and annulled' the order given him to sell the property. Mrs. Karupkat also testified that, on or about the 1st of November, 1919, she visited the agent\u2019s office, gave him a notice in writing not to sell the farm, and he read the notice in her presence.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-8\">The witness, Greenbaum, testified that the agent, Luebbers, admitted that he had been notified by the owners of the property not to sell it, and that they had cancelled the agreement to sell, but that he had refused to consider it, fearing he would lose his commissions. The testimony of the witness, Wensing, the clerk for the agent, Luebbers, is also to the effect that the contract for the sale of the defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>\u00a1aits\u2019 property was considered as cancelled at the office of the agent.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">We find nothing in the evidence that would sustain the contention of the plaintiff that the sale was subsequently ratified and confirmed by the defendants. On the contrary, the testimony on this branch of the case is both conflicting \u00a1aid contradictory, and in no way removes the burden resting upon the plaintiff to show that he was the authorized agent of the defendants to make a valid sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">It is conceded that the agent has recovered a judgment against the appellants for the ten per cent, commission muned in the agreement of September 20, 1919.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-7\">For the reasons stated the decree of the court below will be reversed, and the bill dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-8\">\n<em>Decree reversed and bill dismissed, with costs to the appellants in this Court amd in the court below.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
