Be it enacted and ordained by the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, That the grade of Charles Street between Hoffman and Lanvale Streets and the grade of Eager Street between North and Bur\u00e9n Streets be raised and changed under the direction of the Mayor and City Commissioner so as to enable the Northern Central Railway Company to construct its railway tracks under said streets; and all open \u2022 cuts along Hoffman and other streets shall be tunnelled by the said Railway Company.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-7\">\u201c 'Section 2. That all expenses incurred in making said changes of grade, including the tunnelling and repaving of all paved streets, shall be paid by the Northern Central Railway Company.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-8\">\u201cUnder the above ordinance a fill waS made across Jones\u2019 Palls Valley in the line of Eager Street from the west side of the valley to Jones\u2019 Palls; and a stone <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>arch was built over the falls, which flowed through about the centre of the valley, and the earth All carried over this arch to the east side of the falls, where a bridge abutment was constructed; and another abutment was constructed on the east side of Jones\u2019 Falls Valley, and then an iron bridge with a wooden floor constructed across and between these two abutments spanning the tracks of the Northern Central Railway Company below. Thus Eager Street was upon an earth All or embankment from the west side of the valley to the east side of Jones\u2019 Falls, and from the east side of Jones\u2019 Falls to the east side of the valley it was on the iron bridge with the wooden floor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-5\">\u201cIn the early part of 1884, the Northern Central Railway Company, desiring more tracks on its road between Union Station and Calvert Station than the space on the east side of the falls permitted at Eager Street, applied for and obtained an ordinance from the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, Ordinance No. 88, approved May 24, 1884, authorizing it to lay additional tracks under Eager Street on the west side of the falls by cutting away the embankment aforesaid between the west side of the valley and the west side of the falls, and substituting therefor a bridge to carry Eager Street from the west side of the valley, where a bridge abutment was built, to the west side of the falls, where another bridge abutment was built, the bridge being on the then grade of Eager Street, and, after giving the above authority, said ordinance provides: 'and the said company (the N. O. Ry. Co.) shall, as a condition of the privileges hereby given to it, always maintain and keep in good repair the bridge which it is hereby authorized to construct.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-6\">\u201cThis ordinance also Axed the grade of Eager Street from North Street (now Guilford Avenue) to the bridge on the east side of the falls, the regrading and paving and all other expense in connection with the work to be paid by the Northern Central Railway C onipany.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>\u201cWhen this bridge was completed in 1884 Eager Street was carried by it from the west side of the valley to the abutment on the west side of the falls, and then by a fill or embankment over the arch over the falls to the west abutment of the east bridge over the Northern Central Bailway, and thence by this bridge to the east side of the falls.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-4\">\u201cThereafter, the city constructed its water main in Eager Street, and when the pipe came to the east abutment of the east bridge, which was built under the Ordinance of 1868, it rose to the surface and made an arch over the east bridge, dividing it into a north and south driveway, and then entered the ground again and ran under the surface of the fill between the said east and west bridges; and then when it came to the east abutment of the west bridge constructed under the Ordinance of 1884, it came to the surface again; but, instead of making an arch across the west bridge as it had done with respect to the east bridge, it ran across the bridge partly below and partly above the floor, dividing it also' into a north and south driveway, and rested on iron straps which were made fast to two beams in the centre of the bridge, running east and west, the under surface of the pipe being below the upper surface of the beams; and then over the pipe running east and west over the centre of the bridge was a wooden boxing extending above the surface of the floor 18 inches, completely covering the pipe; and after the pipe crossed the west abutment of the west bridge it made a right angle bend and went under the surface of the street again.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-5\">\u201cThe main tracks of the Northern Central Bailway Company x&gt;assing under the west bridge at Eager Street, which was built in 1884, continued on the west side of the falls to a point north of Eager Street between Eager Street and Chase Street, the next street north running east and west, and then crossed the falls on a bridge to the east side of the falls, and thence went north to Union Station, and has other numerous tracks in the valley on both sides of Jones\u2019 Palls.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>\u201cSuch, was the situation at Eager Street and north, of it when, about the year 1912, the city was planning the construction of the Eallsway viaduct up Jones\u2019 Falls Valley running north and south, which would cross all the streets running east and west across the valley, including Eager Street,\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b111-4\">Coming now to the proceeding's of the company subsequent to the agreement between it and the city, as contained in the letters above referred to, it appears that, before beginning the work of raising the floor of the east bridge to meet the grade of the Fallsway, the company concluded that it needed more room for tracks between the east abutment and the west abutment, of the east bridge, and obtained the consent of the city to set the east abutment of said bridge back eastwardly eighteen feet, and to build a new concrete bridge between the east and west abutments. This bridge was constructed at the expense of the company. And inasmuch as this was a new structure and it became necessary, therefore, that the work of attaching the city\u2019s water main to this structure, by reason of the removal of the old bridge at the company\u2019s request and for its convenience, the company agreed, on the advice of its counsel, to pay, and did pay, the cost of carrying the pipe across this bridge, amounting to $4,392.01. It also agreed to build the concrete tunnel through the abutments and under the railroad between the abutments for the water pipe. But as to the cost of relocating the water main on the west bridge, the company insisted it was under no obligation, either by the terms of the contract or by reason of any purpose or convenience of the company served by the change of location, or by reason of any necessity for such change growing out of the raising of the floor of the bridge to meet the new grade. IVith this conclusion we entirely agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">It is to be observed that, when the bridge was originally built, the water main was attached thereto by the city for its own convenience, and according to its own plans. It ran across the bridge partly below and partly above the floor, ,di<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>viding it into a north and south driveway and rested on iron stops which were made fast to two beams in the centre of the bridge running east and west, the under surface of the pipe being below the upper surface of the beams. Over the pipe was a wooden boxing extending above the surface of the floor eighteen inches.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">The correspondence in regard to the location of the pipe in relation to the change of the floor of the bridge shows beyond any reasonable doubt that the floor of the bridge was raised, at the request of the city engineer and at the expense of the company, much higher than the change of street grade required, solely for the purpose of covering the pipe as it was then located. In a letter fro;m Mr. Latrobe to Mr. Boteler, .acting City Engineer, Mr. Latrobe said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-6\">\u201cIn accordance with your letter of August 15, 1914, I enclose a blue print showing the proposed alterations to Eager Street bridge on the west side of Jones\u2019 Palls, Baltimore. You will see that it was not our intention to make any changes whatever in the cast-iron water pipe over the bridge on the west side of Jones\u2019 Palls, our thought being to merely strengthen the bridge and raise up the floor in accordance with the plan herewith sent you. In case it is decided by the Water Department to make any change in the elevation of the water pipe over the bridge on the west side of Jones\u2019 Palls, we do not think the railroad company should hear any portion of this expense, as no change is necessary until such time as a new bridge on new lines is installed, when it will be necessary for us to make an absolute change in the location of the water pip\u00e9 over the bridge. on the west side of the falls, and this change cannot he made until the new layout of the tracks, etc., in connection with the new Calvert yard is definitely decided on and undertaken.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b112-8\">In his reply to this letter Mr. Boteler says that he will refer the blueprint to the water department, and advise promptly of their intentions as to their pipe location if they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>propose to change same. He makes no objection however to the claim of T.atrobe to exemption from any expense connected with the moving of the pipe, should the city decide to change its location. The omission is significant, because, throughout the correspondence, except in this instance, whenever the compiany suggested that it should not be held for expenses for which it did not think it was responsible, there was always a prompt insistence by the city engineer that the company was liable. It is also significant that nowhere in the correspondence does it appear that the company was ever notified of an intention on the part of the city to change the location of this pipe. On the contrary, the following letters show\u2019 that the city had no such intention.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-4\">\u201cSeptember 16, 1914.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-5\">\u201cMr. H.

Whitman\u2019s letter to me of August 4, 1913, stated that he had estimated that the cost of this work would be approximately $3,500.00.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-10\">\u201cIt is very unfortunate that this bill has been increased by almost 100 per cent., and it seems to me as though you must have included in your hill the recaulking and general repairs to your pipe, etc., which you had done on the west side of the new Eallsway. In view of the fact that the location of this water pipe on the west side of the Eallsway was in no way changed and recaulking of your pipe, etc., which you did was due to no fault of the railroad company, but due to general wear and tear, I shall be very glad if you will go carefully into the bill of $6,718.00 which you sent us, and see if some of this expense cannot be deducted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-11\">\u201cYour prompt reply in regard to this matter is requested.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-12\">\u201cYours respectfully,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-13\">\u201cG.

It must be distinctly understood that no changes of any kind or description were required in your pipe line west of the Eallsway, due to any work of the railroad company. The pipe now rests in identically the same location, with the same supports, as it has always rested. We understand that you made changes in the bends of this pipe at the west end of the bridge and did other work in order to improve the appearance of the bridge and get the pipe under the new floor of this bridge, which floor the Pennsylvania Bailroad Company raised at its expense at the request of the City Engineer, in order to cover over your pipe. We made no change of any kind or description in our bridge west of the Eallsway that could have possibly made the Water Department spend one dollar on their pipe had they not desired to make some change in it. If Mr. Eield is still of the opinion, after having full knowledge of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>this case, that the railroad company is responsible for the cost of this change, will yon kindly have him advise on what grounds he bases his opinion. I am retaining the bill for the \u2018relocation of the thirty-inch water main on the bridge west of the Fallsway viaduct\u2019 for our file until I hear further from you on the subject.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-6\">\u201cYours respectfully,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-7\">\u201cG.

We have had this matter up many times with the Water Engineer\u2019s Department, and this morning my representative met Mr.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-4\">S. S. Eield on the ground and explained the matter to him. Mr. Field was very much surprised at what we told him, and stated that he would take the matter up again with your department, as he certainly had heen told that this water pipe had heen lowered in order to permit the railroad company to get a proper grade on Eager Street, while I am sure that you are well aware that the elevation of the water pipe has not heen changed in the slightest degree from that which it has always heen in, and that the railroad company raised the floor of its bridge over Eager Street, west of the Eallsway, in order to cover this pipe, which formerly projected above the roadway, this being done at the request of the City Engineer and at the expense of the railroad company.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-5\">\u201cYours respectfully,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-6\">\u201cG. Latrobe,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-7\">\u201cGeni. Agt. &amp; Supt.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b120-8\">It will be seen from this correspondence that no one controverts Mr. Latrobe\u2019s assertions that no changes of any kind in the pipe line west of the Fallsway were required by any work of the railroad company, and the company \u201cmade no change of any kind or description in our bridge west of the Fallsway that could have possibly made the water department spend one dollar on their pipe had they not desired to make some change in it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b120-9\">There was a conflict in the oral testimony as to whether or not the pipe was actually lowered. Mr. McKay, the city engineer, testified in chief that the raising of the grade of the Fallsway 300 feet north of Eager Street at the request of the railroad company involved the raising of the Fallsway at Eager Street, and that involved the raising of the grade of the bridge west of the Fallsway.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-10\">It is perfectly evident, however, from his testimony on cross-examination, that the only reason it was necessary to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>change the location of the pipe was to change the condition that had always existed there of having part of the pipe above the floor of the bridge. He admitted that when the new bridge was built, about the same time the city constructed its pipe above the floor, and thus divided the east end of the bridge into two drive ways, and tbe only answer he could give to the question why the change which he said was necessary on the west end of the bridge was not necessary on the east end, was that Mr. Hendrick, and not the witness, had charge of the work on the east end. The witness, however, was forced to admit that he had approved that work. He also admitted that the city had originally located the pipe above the floor of the west bridge, but said that was done as a matter of economy.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">On all the evidence in the case we are satisfied that the trial court erred in refusing to grant the first prayers of the defendant withdrawing the case from the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">It may be that good engineering required that the pipe should be entirely under, rather than partly over, the floor of the bridge; but however that may be, we are quite sure the change could not be made at the expense of the defendant, there being <em>no such </em>requirement in the contract, and no necessity for it, resulting from anything that was done at the request, or for the benefit, of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-7\">\n<em>Judgment reversed without a new trial, u\u00f1th costs to appellant.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
