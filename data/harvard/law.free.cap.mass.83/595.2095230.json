The trial in the superior court was before <em>Wilkinson, </em>J., who signed a bill of exceptions, of which the following is the material portion.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b605-7\">\u201c The evidence showed that said Adams had in his possession a warrant purporting to have issued from the tax collector and treasurer of Quincy. No evidence was before the jury to prove that said warrant was duly issued, or that Mr. Cummings, by whom the warrant was signed, was the treasurer or tax collector of Quincy. The defendant\u2019s counsel asked the court to rule, that the simple warrant in the hands of Mr. Adams, unsupported by other evidence, was insufficient to authorize Mr. Adams to act upon. But the court declined so to rule, but admitted the warrant as evidence, and allowed the case to go to the jury with evidence upon the other parts of the case. The jury found the defendant guilty.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b605-8\">No counsel appeared for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b605-9\"><em>Foster, </em>A.

It applies as well to a warrant in the hands of an officer and purporting to be signed by the tax collector and treasurer of a town, as to any of the decided cases.
