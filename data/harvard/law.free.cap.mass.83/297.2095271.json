The policy was for one year from the 1st of October 1855, and contained the following clauses: \u201cto which <em>(i. e. </em>to the application) reference is to be had in explanation of this instrument, and by which the said assured is bound, under the limitations and conditions expressed in the by-laws aforesaid.\u201d \u201c Now, know ye, that the absolute and conditional funds of the said company are hereby bound and subjected to satisfy and make good unto the said assured, his heirs, executors, administrators or assigns, all the loss or damage by fire which may happen to the said insured property, within the term aforesaid, according to the true intent and meaning of the said act of incorporation and by-laws.\u201d The 10th article of the by-laws was as follows: \u201c Every member sustaining loss by fire shall forthwith give notice thereof to the company, and within thirty days shall file with the secretary a particular account of the amount of his loss, and the whole value the property insured at the time of such fire.\u201d \u201c And unless such proofs, declarations and certificates shall be produced within said thirty days,\u201d \u201c the losses shall not be payable.\u201d \u201c Any loss not claimed within said thirty days shall not. be paid unless by consent of two thirds of the directors.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b308-6\">Upon the book of records of the directors of the company a vote was recorded, before the time of issuing the policy in suit, appointing Stone as an agent; but there was no proof of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>nature of his agency except his acts of receiving and transmitting the application and policy in the present case. The property insured was destroyed by fire on the night of August 3 1856; and at this time Nahum Stone lived within a few hundred feet of the place where it was situated. No notice of the loss was given to the defendants, or to any of their agents or officers, until January 1858.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b309-5\">M. &amp; J. Ricker afterwards went into insolvency, and, in December 1857, the plaintiffs were chosen assignees. About the 1st of January 1858, Smith, one of the plaintiffs, saw the president of the company, and told him the reason why the notice and proof of loss had been omitted, to wit, that the Rickers had another policy, which they looked at by mistake, and found that it had expired; and the president replied that the company would be disposed to do what was right, that they knew at the time of the fire that it was their loss, and were surprised that they were not notified, and asked him to go before the directors. He went before the directors, and they directed him to have the Rickers send to them a statement of the loss, and they would take the subject into consideration; but made no promise of payment. The statement of loss was sent accordingly.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b309-6\">A copy of the records of the directors of the company was put in evidence, as follows: \u201c Action of the directors of the Haverhill Fire Insurance Company in case of M. &amp; J.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AkI\">This is a very plain case. The plaintiffs claim in the right of the original assured, and are bound by all the stipulations contained in the contract of insurance. By the tenth article of the by-laws it is provided, that the assured shall within thirty days after a loss by fire file with the secretary of the company a particular account of the amount of his loss, the value of the property insured at the time of the fire, and his interest and title therein. It is also further provided by the same by-law that, unless such proofs and declarations are filed within thirty days, losses shall not be payable. The policy was clearly made subject to this by-law. Not only did the assured in the application which is referred to in the policy agree to be bound by the by-laws, but the promise of the defendants was to indemnify the assured \u201c according to the true intent and meaning of, the act of incorporation and by-laws.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b310-7\">It is not pretended that the provisions of the by-laws were complied with by the assured. No notice of the loss was given to the company until nearly a year and a half after the fire. By the terms of the contract, therefore, the loss was not payable.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-8\">There was no sufficient evidence of a waiver of this provision in the by-laws by the directors of the company, nor of any consent to the payment of the loss by two thirds of the directors, according to the stipulations in the same article of the by-laws. All the facts show that the defendants stood on their rights, and never intended to yield anything in the negotiations which they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>had with the plaintiffs. After so long a lapse of time between the occurrence of the fire and the notice of the loss, very strong evidence of waiver would be necessary. During this interval of time many old members of the company must have ceased to be associates, by the expiration of their policies, and many new ones had doubtless come in. Under such circumstances, therefore, it is difficult to believe that the directors would consent to admit their liability for a loss from which they had been discharged by the loches of the assured, and which, if allowed, would essentially affect the interests of their policy holders. This view of the case renders it unnecessary to decide whether the directors had power to waive the provisions of the by-laws relating to the notice of loss.

Co. ante, </em>294.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">\n<em>Judgment on the verdict.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
