At the trial in the superior, court the plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>tiffs offered evidence tending to prove, that the defendant left his horses, harnessed to a wagon, standing on his own land within about fifteen feet of his house and within the enclosure adjoining the same, without being tied, or under the charge of any person; and went into the house, out of sight of the horses, to give directions to the workmen employed therein; and that the horses started and ran into the road and against the wagon in which the plaintiffs were riding, and thereby injured the female plaintiff. The defendant offered evidence tending to control and vary this evidence of the plaintiff, and also offered to show his own character as a careful, prudent and cautious man, as bearing on the question of whether he used ordinary care on this occasion. To this last the plaintiffs objected, and <em>Morton, </em>J., rejected the evidence. The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiffs, and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b196-5\"><em>G. M.

At the trial the only fact offered in proof of the alleged cause of action was the defendant\u2019s leaving his horses, that were harnessed to a wagon, standing on his land near his house, without tying them or leaving them under the charge of any other person. The verdict shows that this fact, though there was conflicting testimony concerning it, was found by the jury, and that they also found that it was legal proof of such want of care as rendered the defendant liable for the injury sustained by the female plaintiff And the court are of opinion that evidence of the defendant\u2019s being a careful, prudent and cautious man was not admissible for the purpose of showing that he used, in this instance, such care of his horses as the law requires in order to exempt him from responsibility for the mischief produced by their escape into the highway. When the precise act or omission of a defendant is proved, the question whether it is actionable negligence is to be decided by. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>the character of that act or omission, and not by the character for care and caution that the defendant may sustain.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">If such evidence as was offered and rejected at the trial is ever admissible, in a case like this, we incline to the opinion that it is only when the plaintiff attempts to prove the defendant\u2019s negligence by merely circumstantial evidence, or, perhaps, by witnesses shown to be of doubtful veracity. These exceptions do not show, nor was it suggested in argument, that the excluded evidence was admissible on either of these grounds. See 1 Greenl. Ev. \u00a7 54; Wills on Circumstantial Ev. 131; <em>Townsend </em>v. Graves, 3 Paige, 455; <em>Gough </em>v. <em>St. </em>Johns, 16 Wend. 646. <em>Exceptions overruled</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
