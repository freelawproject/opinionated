The first policy insured the plaintiffs in the sum of $600 on their shop and dwelling-house in Methuen; and the second in the sum of $1,000 on their dwelling-house in the same town. The plaintiffs claimed for a total loss, and the fact of the loss within the time covered by the policy was not denied; but it was denied that the plaintiffs had any insurable interest in any part of the property described. At the trial in this court the plaintiffs introduced in evidence the two policies and applications, and there rested, claiming that they had made out a <em>mima facie </em>case under the pleadings; and <em>Metcalf </em>J., so ruled. The policies and applications described the property insured as property of the plaintiffs; and, in reply to question 10 in both applications, \u201c Is it incumbered, and if so for what sum ? <em>\u201d </em>the plaintiffs answered, \u201c Applicants are mortgagees in possession. Other incumbrance exists.\u201d Both applications also contained a valuation of the property described; and both policies contained the following language: \u201c The amount insured being not more than three fourths the val\u00fae of said property, as appears by the proposal of the said assured.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b74-6\">The defendants contended that the above answer to question 10 contained a material misrepresentation of the title to the premises, and introduced evidence as follows: 1. A mortgage of the premises insured, with other property, from Alonzo Waldo to Charles Waldo, dated May 4' 1837, to secure a note of $11,500 of the same date. Charles Waldo commenced an action to foreclose this mortgage in 1849, which was continued until December 1859, at which time conditional judgment was entered for $27,000. The value of the whole property covered by this mortgage, at the time of the insurance, did not exceed $11,000. 2. A mortgage of the premises insured, with other property, from George A. Waldo to Thomas P. Rich, dated September 25 1847, to secure a note of $5,000 of the same date. Rich made an entry, for the purpose of foreclosure., July <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>1 1850, which was recorded July 3 1850; and another entry for the same purpose, in the presence of witnesses, February 3 1851, which was recorded February 7 1851. The value of the whole property covered by this mortgage, at the time of the insurance, did not exceed $8,000. 3. A deed of the premises insured from G. A. Waldo to the plaintiffs, dated September 25 1848.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b75-5\">The defendants offered to prove certain false declarations of the plaintiffs, made at the time when the policies were issued, relative to their having bought up the incumbrances upon the property; but the evidence was rejected. The defendants also offered to prove that Thomas P. Rich effected an insurance in the name of the plaintiffs upon the same property, which insurance was in force at the time of the loss, and that Rich had received upon his policy the sum of $1,500. One of the bylaws annexed to the present policy was as follows : \u201c All applications for insurance will state whether there be a previous policy on the property insured. If a previous policy exists, and is not disclosed, the policy in this company will be void.\u201d There was in each of the applications a printed question inquiring for existing insurances upon the premises, to which no answer was made. As there was no offer to prove that the plaintiffs knew of the existence of the insurance by Rich at the time of their application to the defendants, the court rejected the evidence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b75-6\">The fact having been elicited on cross-examination that Jacob W. Pierce, one of the plaintiffs, paid Rich $1,000 in April 1857, upon a certain agreement between them, the plaintiffs were allowed, under objection, to prove the agreement by a letter from Rich to Pierce, and a receipt, which were as follows: \u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b75-7\">\u201c Boston, March 17 1857. Dear Sir: I understand your offer to be \u2014 You will give me one thousand dollars, cash, for my claim against G. A. Waldo\u2019s estate, and I am to transfer all my right and title of the same to you. You further, in consideration of this transfer, agree to give me your obligation and bond to divide with me <em>pro rata </em>all you may realize from the estate, reckoning our several claims from the dates thereof, interest on the same, and all expenses each has incurred upon them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b76-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>\u201c You are to prosecute the claims to their settlement with all other claimants upon the estate, at the expense of estate, or at your own expense, should you' not succeed in recovering any* thing.

Pierce, dated March 19,1857 ; another assignment of the same by Waldo to Isaac D. Farnsworth, dated June 17,1857; and another assignment of the same \u2022 by Farnsworth to Pierce, dated December 7, 1859. These several assignments are more fully referred to in the opinion of the court. The plaintiffs also introduced evidence, under objection, tending to prove that, at the time of the execution of the deed from George A. Waldo to them, they executed an agreement for the reconveyance of the same; but this evidence, and the questions growing out of it, became immaterial in the final determination of the case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b76-10\">Upon all the evidence, the judge ruled that the policies were valued policies, and that the plaintiffs were entitled to recover; and a verdict having been rendered accordingly, the defendants alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b76-11\"><em>N.

The plaintiffs, at the time of their application, had no interest whatever in the premises. The mortgage to Rich had been fully foreclosed. 3. If not fully foreclosed, the equity of re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>demption was worthless. 4. The defendants had no right to issue a valued policy since <em>St. </em>1856, <em>c. </em>252, \u00a7 31. 5. The false declarations of the plaintiffs were admissible, as part of the <em>res gestm. </em>6. The evidence of double insurance was admissible. See by-laws. <em>Barrett </em>v. <em>Union Ins.

This ruling is objected to. It became immaterial, because the title appeared in the course of the trial by undisputed evidence. But the court are of opinion that in mutual insurance the representations of the assured, in respect to the title, stand upon the same ground with other representations. The policy may be avoided by proving their falsehood in any material part; but the legal presumption is that they are true. The ruling was therefore correct. See the opinion of Strong, J. in <em>Fowler </em>v. <em>N. York Ins. Co. </em>23 Barb. 150.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-8\">In the application, certain questions are answered respecting the property. Question 10: \u201c Is it incumbered ? If so, for what sum <em>1\" </em>Answer: \u201c Applicants are mortgagees in possession. Other incumbrance exists.\u201d It is objected that this answer contains a material misrepresentation. Whether this is so depends upon the true state of the title. At the, time of the application, September 19 1859, the property had been mortgaged as follows: To Charles Waldo, May 4 1837, with other property, for \u00a711,500; to Thomas P. Rich, September 25 1847, for \u00a75,000; to the plaintiffs, September 25 1848. A question was raised at the trial as to the admission of evidence tending to prove a defeasance, the deed of the plaintiffs being absolute on its face but the opinion of the court makes that evidence immaterial. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>Rich made two entries to foreclose his mortgage; one in 1850, the other in 1851. Under the last entry his foreclosure was perfected ; and it is immaterial whether the first was perfected or not. The plaintiffs\u2019 title was extinguished by the foreclosure in <em>1854, </em>though both the plaintiffs and Rich did several acts after-wards tending to show that both parties believed that this mortgage was not foreclosed. The defendants offered evidence tho Rich, in October 1856, obtained insurance on the buildings in the plaintiffs\u2019 name, though without their knowledge.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">In this state of things the plaintiffs negotiated with Charles Waldo, and obtained from him an assignment of his mortgage, March 19 1857. This was made to Pierce, one of their firm, but was paid for by their joint funds. They were then negotiating with Rich for the purchase of his interest. Two days before, he had written Pierce a letter agreeing to sell him his interest for $1,000 cash, and a further contingent sum, depending on the price which should be obtained on a sale of the land. It was to be a <em>pro rata </em>share on all the mortgages, thus admitting the validity of all. On the 18th of April the $1,000 was paid him by the plaintiffs. From this time the title stood as follows: The legal title as mortgagee was in Pierce, in trust for the other plaintiffs and himself. The right of possession followed, and there is no pretence that Rich ever interfered with it afterwards. A suit had long been pending to foreclose the Charles Waldo mortgage, and was afterwards prosecuted to judgment, apparently because the parties supposed the Rich mortgage had not been foreclosed, and that there was an equity of redemption still existing in some person. In June, the plaintiffs took a second assignment to Farnsworth, their clerk; but it was inoperative, as the title was already in Pierce.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">The court are of opinion that, the plaintiffs being in possession, and Pierce being the legal assignee of the mortgage, in trust for them all, the answer contained no misrepresentation that should avoid the policy. The lien of the defendants on the property insured was as perfect as if all had been assignees of the legal title. The answer that other incumbrances existed was true. It is objected that the answer was insufficient, be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>cause it did not state the incumbrances more fully; but it is settled that the issuing of a policy upon the representations made is a waiver of such an objection. <em>Hall </em>v. <em>People's Ins. Co. </em>6 Gray, 185. <em>Allen </em>v. <em>Charlestown Ins. Co. </em>5 Gray, 389. <em>Liberty Hall Ass'n </em>v. <em>Housatonic Ins. Co. </em>7 Gray, 261.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">The defendants\u2019 position, that they were deceived and defrauded because of the great amount of the mortgages, is untenable. It is based on the idea that the plaintiffs were in possession under their own mortgage only, and subject to the mortgages of Rich and Charles Waldo. If this had been so, and their insurance had been upon their interest under a third mortgage, the objection would have had force. But as they were in under the first mortgage, which gave them an unincumbered interest several times greater than the amount of the insurance, the amount of the mortgages was not material. The insurance had relation to the value of the buildings, and not to the cost of the whole property. The state of the title, as admitted by the parties, makes the paroi evidence which was offered by the defendants to prove fraud wholly immaterial. The fact that Rich obtained insurance on the property in the name of the plaintiffs, and without their knowledge, was equally immaterial, because it could not prejudice their claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">It was correctly ruled that this was a valued policy. It was such in the sense in which that term is applied to policies of fire insurance. <em>Borden </em>v. <em>Hingham Ins. Co. </em>18 Pick. 523. <em>Fuller </em>v. <em>Boston Ins. Co. </em>4 Met. 206. <em>Holmes </em>v. <em>Charlestown Ins. Co. </em>10 Met. 211. <em>Phillips </em>v. <em>Merrimack Ins. Co. </em>10 Cush. 350.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-7\">Upon these principles and the admitted facts, the jury were properly instructed that the plaintiffs were entitled to recover.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-8\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
