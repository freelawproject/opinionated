The following facts were agreed:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b454-5\">In 1811, John Amory, being the owner of a number of lots on Common Street, now Tremont Street, in Boston, and of a passage way on the south side thereof, which separated them from other land owned by him, conveyed one of the lots to John T. <em>Apthorp. </em>by a deed of warranty, the material portions of which are copied in the margin.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> The defendant now owns the title thus conveyed ; and the plaintiffs own the title left in Amory to the passage way south of the lot conveyed, and the land on the other side thereof. Upon the plan the lines of the several lots, and of the two passage ways referred to, are marked out. The passage way in dispute leads from Common Street easterly, along the south line of the lot conveyed to Apthorp, until it connects with the other passage way in the rear. In 1859, the defendant took down a house then standing upon his lot, and erected a new one, the outer walls of which stand upon the same lines as those of the former house, and built bay-windows projecting over the passage way, and of sufficient height above it not to interfere with the passage of vehicles. If, upon the tone con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>struetion of the deed from Amory to Apthorp, and the foregoing facts, the plaintiffs are entitled to recover, judgment shall be entered for them for one dollar damages and costs; otherwise for the defendant, without costs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b455-5\">Upon the above agreement, judgment was ordered in the superior court, by Brigham, J., for the plaintiffs, and the defendant appealed to this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b455-6\"><em>C.

In every case of a conveyance of land described as bounded by a passage way, the question whether the boundary of the granted land is the side line or the centre line of such passage way, is one of construction, depending upon the intent of the parties as expressed in the descriptive part of the deed, explained by all the other parts of the conveyance, and by the localities and subject-matter to which it applies. <em>Webber </em>v. <em>Eastern Railroad, 2 </em>Met. 151. <em>Parker </em>v. <em>Framingham, </em>8 Met. 266. <em>O\u2019Linda </em>v. <em>Lothrop, </em>21 Pick. 292. <em>Newhall </em>v. <em>Ireson, </em>8 Cush. 595. <em>Sibley </em>v. <em>Holden, </em>10 Pick. 249. <em>Tyler </em>v. <em>Hammond, </em>11 Pick. 193. <em>Phillips </em>v. <em>Bowers, </em>7 Gray, 24. <em>Child </em>v. <em>Starr, </em>4 Hill, 382. <em>Murdock </em>v. <em>Chapman, </em>9 Gray, 156. 2. The intent of the parties to the deed in question, as expressed in the whole conveyance, and explained by the plan referred to in the deed and subscribed by the grantees, is clearly to exclude the whole of the passage way. <em>Morgan </em>v. <em>Moore, </em>3 Gray, 320. <em>Blaney </em>v. <em>Rice, </em>20 Pick. 62. <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Rainsford, </em>17 Mass. 211, and cases before cited.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b455-7\"><em>G.

It is settled that, by a deed bounding on or by a public or private way, the grantor conveys the fee to the middle of the way. <em>Newhall </em>v. <em>Ireson, </em>8 Cush. 595. <em>Fisher </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>9 Gray, 441. <em>Phillips </em>v. <em>Bowers, </em>7 Gray, 24. <em>Winslow </em>v. <em>King, </em>14 Gray, 321. <em>Cold Spring Iron Works </em>v. <em>Tolland, </em>9 Cush. 492. The boundary in this case is on a passage way. 2. The reference in the deed to the plan does not determine the construction to be given to the language. The passage way is the monument which is shown on the plan. The language is \u201cthe above house and passage ways are hereby described according to a plan.\u201d If the boundary had been on a stream or wall, and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>side lines of the stream or wall had been shown on the plan, would not the boundary have been by the middle of the stream or wall? The lines of a plan are not monuments. A plan must be located by the aid of monuments. <em>Herring </em>v. <em>Fisher, </em>1 Sandf. 344, 349. <em>Hammond </em>v. <em>McLachlan, </em>1 Sandf. 323, 343.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b454-6\"> \u201c Lot called number five, bounded westerly in front on Common Street, there measuring thirty feet, northerly on lot number four this day conveyed by said Amory to John Bellowes, there measuring eighty seven feet six inches, easterly on an open piece of land or passage way, there measuring twenty three feet eight inches, southerly on a certain nine feet passage way, or open piece of land, lying between the land herein conveyed and the house of said Amory, occupied by the widow Leverett, the said southerly line making an elbow at the distance of forty six feet from Common Street, said lot there being twenty eight feet three inches broad.\u201d Said Apthorp, his heirs and assigns, \u201c shall have the use and benefit of one other passage way of nine feet in width, communicating with the one aforementioned and Common Street, and situate as aforesaid between the land herein conveyed and house occupied by the widow Leverett, which last-mentioned passage way is to be only of the width of nine feet, and it is understood that said Amory, his heirs and assigns or tenants of his other estates shall also have equal use and improvement of both the aforegoing passage ways.\u201d \u201c The above house and passage ways are hereby described according to a plan of the same subscribed by the several grantees of said lots, to which reference is had.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b456-5\">Chapman, J.</author>\n<p id=\"APnX\">Where land is granted bounding upon a way, public or private, the question whether it extends to the side line or the centre line of the way is a question of construction in each particular case, and depends upon the intent of the parties as expressed in the descriptive part of the deed, explained and illustrated by all the other parts of the conveyance, and by the localities to which it applies. This position is sustained by the authorities cited on the plaintiffs\u2019 brief, and is stated substantially in the language of <em>Shaw, </em>C. J. in <em>Webber </em>v. <em>Eastern Railroad, </em>2 Met. 151. Its application to the deed of Amory to Apthorp is to determine this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">The lot in question is conveyed with other land, and is described as being <em>\u201c </em>called number five.\u201d It is bounded \u201c northerly on lot number four this day conveyed by said Amory to John Bellowes.\u201d As the lots on the plan hereafter mentioned are not numbered, we learn from this description which lot the parties called \u201c number five,\u201d there being no dispute as to which lot was conveyed to Bellowes. The measurements of the lot are next given in feet and inches, and they correspond with the lines as marked on the plan. This fact has some tendency to show that those lines are the boundaries of the lot; but distances are so often found to be erroneously stated, that they are not relied upon with much confidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-7\">The description continues, \u201c southerly on a certain nine feet passage way, or open piece of land, lying between the land herein conveyed and the house of said Amory, occupied by the widow .Leverett,\u201d This language excludes the passage way from the lot granted; for if the way lies between the lot conveyed and the house mentioned, the lot is external to the way. It then proceeds, \u201c the said southerly line making an elbow at the distance of forty six feet from Common Street, said lot there being twenty eight feet three inches broad.\u201d The descrip<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>tian of the elbow corresponds with the south line marked on the plan and with nothing else. We must reject it if we ex-, tend the lot to the middle of the passage way.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">The grantor covenants that Apthorp, his heirs and assigns, <em>\u201c </em>shall have the use and benefit of one other passage way (referring to this one), of nine feet in width, communicating with the one aforementioned and Common Street, and situate as aforesaid between the land herein conveyed and house occupied by the widow Leverett, which last-mentioned passage way is to be only of the width of nine feet, and it is understood that said Amory, his heirs and assigns or tenants of his other estates, shall also have equal use and improvement of both the aforegoing passage ways.\u201d This grant of \u201c the use and benefit \u201d of a passage way imports only the grant of an easement. It has an equal application to all the parts of the nine feet in width. The words which follow restrain the grant from being exclusive, and declare that it is to be in common with the grantor, his tenants, heirs and assigns. They do not import a reservation of a right of way over land of which the fee is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">The description ends as follows : \u201c The above house and passage ways are hereby described according to a plan of the same subscribed by the several grantees of said lots, to which reference is had.\u201d Where there is nothing to indicate the contrary, the external lines of a lot, as marked on a plan referred to, are presumed to be the boundaries of the lot. In this deed there is nothing to indicate that the lot extends beyond the lines; but the clauses above referred to, which are all that are material in deciding the question, indicate quite plainly that the fee was not granted in any part of the passage way.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-7\">The grantees of an easement are limited to the use granted. <em>Atkins </em>v. <em>Bordman, 2 </em>Met. 457. They are liable to an action for any unauthorized use. <em>Appleton </em>v. <em>Fullerton, </em>1 Gray, 186. The erection of a bay-window over the soil is a tort for which an action lies, though the damage may be merely nominal, for it invades the plaintiffs\u2019 right.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-8\">\n<em>Judgment for the plaintiffs; damages one dollar, by agreement</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
