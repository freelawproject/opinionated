Moore, a police officer of Boston. At the trial in the superior court, evidence was introduced tending to show that a person against whom Moore had a warrant on a criminal charge was seen to enter the defendant\u2019s house in the night, and that Moore after-wards knocked at the outer door, and was admitted with three <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>other officers ; that, after being so admitted, he was asked what he wanted, and replied that he wished to find a man against whom he had a warrant; that the defendant answered, \u201c there is nobody here for you,\u201d and demanded by what authority he entered; that Moore did not exhibit any warrant, but he and his associates all wore the badge and uniform in use among the police officers of the city of Boston. There was conflicting evidence in relation to the circumstances immediately attending the commission of the assault, but they were submitted to the jury under instructions respecting which no question was raised at' the argument. Two witnesses on the part of the defence testified that the person for whom Moore was seeking was riot in the defendant\u2019s house when he entered it, and had not been there that night. The defendant requested the court to instruct the jury that, unless the person whom Moore was endeavoring to arrest was in fact in the defendant\u2019s house at the time of his entering it, the defendant had a right to treat him as a trespasser, and to use such force as was necessary to prevent him from carrying out his purposes. But <em>Ames, </em>J., declined so to rule, and instructed the jury that Moore, after knocking at the door and being admitted, had a right, acting in good faith and in a reasonable manner, to make search in the premises for the person against whom he had a warrant, if he reasonably and in fact supposed that person to be there ; and that he was not bound to exhibit his warrant to the defendant, provided the defendant had reasonable notice, from Moore\u2019s badge, uniform and declaration, that he was an officer and was acting under a warrant against a person whom he supposed to be there.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b598-5\">The jury returned a verdict of guilty, and the defendant al\u2019eged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b598-6\"><em>G.

Foster\u2019s Crown Law, 321. 1 East P. C. 323, 324. 1 Deacon\u2019s Crim. Law, 52. 1 Russ, on Crimes, (7th Amer. ed.) 628. According to these books, an exception, in favor of an officer holding a warrant against an alleged offender, is made to the rule stated in 2 Hale P. C. 103, 117, that an officer, who breaks into another\u2019s house to arrest a felon, does it at his peril, and is justifiable, if the felon be there, and not justifiable, if he be not there. But we think that this exception should be qualified, as it was in the judge\u2019s instructions, by the proviso that the officer must have reasonable cause to believe that the person against whom he holds a warrant is in the bouse; and when thus qualified, we deem it a sound rule of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>law. In the case at bar, however, the officer had no occasion to enter the defendant\u2019s house forcibly, but was admitted immediately on his knocking at the outer door. And we must infer from the verdict which was returned under the instructions given, that the jury found that the officer had reasonable cause to believe, and in fact did believe, that the person, against whom he held a warrant, was in the house, and that he did no more in the house than he lawfully might do.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">The instructions as to the showing of the warrant to the defendant, by the officer, substantially conformed to the law.
