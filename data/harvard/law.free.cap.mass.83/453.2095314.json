The commissioner reported that, after the introduction of testimony, it was agreed by the plaintiff\u2019s counsel that the allegations in the bill of exceptions were true.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b464-6\"><em>E. Bangs, </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A50\">There was no dispute as to the facts stated in the bill of exceptions. The exceptions were disallowed by reason of the judge\u2019s opinion that, in matter of law, the defendant was not entitled to a new trial. But the paper was improperly sent to the jury, with the knowledge and consent of the party in whose favor the verdict was returned, with out the consent or knowledge of the defendant\u2019s counsel, and after his objection to its admission as evidence ; it was read by the jury, and may have influenced them, and their verdict should therefore be set aside. <em>Whitney </em>v. <em>Whitman, </em>5 Mass. 405. <em>Sar</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number><em>gent </em>v. <em>Roberts, </em>1 Pick. 337. <em>Hix </em>v. <em>Drury, </em>5 Pick. 296. <em>Sheaff </em>v. <em>Gray, </em>2 Yeates, 273.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b465-5\"><em>S. E. Sewall, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A1n0\">This is not a case for exceptions, as there was no opinion, ruling, direction or judgment of the court, in matter of law, to be excepted to. Rev. Sts. c. 82, \u00a7 12. St. 1859, c. 196, \u00a7 27. Gen.

In many such cases new trials have been refused. <em>Hix </em>v. <em>Drury, </em>5 Pick. 296. <em>Lonsdale </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>4 Wash. C. C.

J.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></author>\n<p id=\"Avd\">The only ground on which the counsel for the plaintiff seeks to sustain the verdict in this case is that the act of the court, in allowing the paper to go to the jury, cannot be revised here, having been done in the exercise of a judicial discretion to which no exception lies. But we cannot so regard it. Evidence which had a direct bearing on the issue, and which had been objected to during the trial and rejected as incompetent, was allowed to be submitted to the jury. This was done by the express direction of the judge. There can be no doubt that the admission of such evidence in the course of the trial would have been good ground of exception. It is equally so when, after the trial is over and the jury are deliberating on their verdict, the judge directs it to be laid before them. Its effect on the rights of the parties is the same as if it had been ruled in during the trial; and the mode of admitting it \u2014 in the absence of counsel, and when they had no opportunity to comment upon it \u2014 was certainly most objectionable.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-8\">\n<em>Exceptions sustained.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b465-9\"> Hoar, J. did not sit in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
