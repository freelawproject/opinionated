L. c. 152, the workers\u2019 compensation act. The judgment affirmed the decision of the reviewing board, which had affirmed and adopted the findings and decision of the single member. We affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-13\">According to the single member\u2019s subsidiary findings of fact, the employee, on the evening of September 27, 1979, committed suicide by hanging. The incident occurred in his home. During the course of the evening, the employee conducted himself in a routine manner. He had been working in his basement on projects such as rebuilding motors and small appliances. He left behind a note addressed to his daughter which included the following postscript: \u201cJen, sue Marshall\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>&amp; Mr. [Stone].<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Mr. [Stone] put your dad through hell on earth. He harassed me since 1975. Four long years of hell.\u201d Marshall\u2019s is the employer in this case. The employee was a district manager, and Stone was his supervisor during the four years prior to his death. The employee had had a number of differences with Stone at work. The employee had also experienced some serious health and personal problems during the same period. He continued to be employed at Marshall\u2019s until the date of his death.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">In order to recover under the workers\u2019 compensation act for her husband\u2019s suicide, the claimant was required to show three things. First, she had to show that her husband suffered \u201ca personal injury arising out of and in the course of his employment.\u201d G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 26. See <em>Kelley\u2019s Case, </em>394 Mass. 684 (1985). Next, the claimant had to demonstrate a causal connection between the injury and her husband\u2019s suicide. <em>Fitzgibbons\u2019s Case, </em>3,74 Mass. 633, 635-637 (1978). Finally, the claimant had to prove \u201cthat, due to the injury, the employee was of such unsoundness of mind as to make him irresponsible for his act of suicide.\u201d G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 26A, inserted by St. 1937, c. 370, \u00a7 2. See <em>Lambert\u2019s Case, </em>364 Mass. 832 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">The single member, the reviewing board, and the judge in the Superior Court, all based denial of compensation on the absence of expert testimony to establish a causal connection between the employee\u2019s injury and his suicide, a matter viewed as one not within the common knowledge or experience of a layperson. See <em>Oberlander\u2019s Case, </em>348 Mass. 1, 5 (1964); <em>Fitzgibbons\u2019s Case, </em>374 Mass. at 635. We need not reach either the issue whether expert testimony was required to prove causation or the issue whether the employee suffered a<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> personal injury arising out of and in the course of his employment. This is because of the claimant\u2019s failure to meet her burden under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 26A, to show the employee\u2019s unsoundness of mind at the time of his suicide.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>The claimant, a nurse with a \u201cprofessional awareness\u201d of psychological problems, relied exclusively upon the suicide and the suicide note to prove that her husband was of an unsound mind. She testified, however, that, prior to the suicide, her husband had exhibited no signs of any psychological problems.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">General Laws c. 152, \u00a7 26A, was intended to make it easier for a dependent to recover compensation in the event of an employee\u2019s suicide than it had been under the prior law. See <em>Oberlander\u2019s Case, </em>348 Mass. at 5 n.1; Locke, Workmen\u2019s Compensation \u00a7 225 (2d ed. 1981). See generally, 1A Larson, Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law \u00a7 36 (1985). Before the effective date of the statute, the Supreme Judicial Court required a claimant, in order to recover compensation for an employee\u2019s suicide, to prove that a work-related personal injury caused \u201can insanity of such violence as to cause the victim to take his own life through an uncontrollable impulse or in a delirium of frenzy \u2018without conscious volition to produce death ....\u2019\u201d <em>Sponatski\u2019s Case, 220 </em>Mass. 526, 530 (1915). See <em>Tetrault\u2019s Case, </em>278 Mass. 447, 448 (1932); <em>Ruschetti\u2019s Case, 299 </em>Mass. 426, 428 (1938).</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">Although it may no longer be necessary for a claimant to prove that the employee\u2019s suicide was the result of a \u201cviolent\u201d insanity and an uncontrollable impulse, and also that it was without conscious volition to produce death, there still must be a basis for a finding of \u201csuch unsoundness of mind as to make him irresponsible for his act of suicide.\u201d G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 26A. It may be that, depending on the facts, expert testimony relating to the employee\u2019s mental condition will not be required in every case. Here, however, there was an absence of any indication of unsoundness of mind apart from the suicide itself. The content of the suicide note does not seem to us to be indicative of irrational thinking. If the fact of suicide alone were sufficient proof of an unsound mind, the requirement in the statute that the employee be of an unsound mind would be meaningless. On the contrary, the reference to the employee\u2019s mental condition is a significant part of the statute. The Legislature, while ameliorating the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>harshness of the old rule, adopted the altogether reasonable principle that an act of suicide ought to preclude compensation if the decision to commit suicide is made voluntarily by a person not suffering from work-related mental illness or unsoundness of mind.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b242-7\">We use a pseudonym.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
