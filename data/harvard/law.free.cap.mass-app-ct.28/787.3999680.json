The judge found Thibeault guilty of the lesser included offense of possessing cocaine with intent to distribute, and of the like offense with respect to marihuana, the latter conviction being placed on file with the defendant\u2019s consent. On January 19, 1989, the judge sentenced Thibeault to six to ten years imprisonment at M.C.I., Cedar Junction, sentence suspended for three years with conditions that he undergo periodic drug examinations and remain substance free. From the time of arraignment onward, Thibeault was represented by an attorney, Richard B. M\u00f3dica.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-5\">For probation violations, Thibeault was surrendered, and on September 6, 1989, now represented by new counsel, he was brought before the judge who had presided at the trial. After hearing, the judge, finding violations, imposed the original sentence. However, on October 2, 1989, counsel filed a motion for a new trial, which, as supplemented,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> stated that M\u00f3dica had been suspended from law practice for two years by order of a single justice of the Supreme Judicial Court entered December 29, 1988,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and was under suspension during Thibeault\u2019s trial and sentencing. This, itself, according to the motion, should be held to have deprived Thibeault of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"789\">*789</page-number>\u201cassistance of counsel\u201d guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment. In addition, there was a claim that Modica\u2019s actual representation of Thibeault at pretrial and trial stages was constitutionally inadequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-5\">M\u00f3dica was suspended from practice because he had been convicted of the crime of receiving stolen property (computer equipment taken from a local school), for which he was sentenced to one year\u2019s unsupervised probation.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The record hints at some extenuating circumstances, but the Board of Bar Overseers declined to consider them and took the conviction at face value, and the single justice accepted the board\u2019s recommendation of two years\u2019 suspension.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-6\">To return to the new-trial motion in Thibeault\u2019s case, the judge held that the fact M\u00f3dica was under suspension while representing Thibeault (and failed to inform his client or the trial court) did not, of itself, compel a finding of ineffective assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-7\">Going on to the claim that Modica\u2019s actual conduct of Thibeault\u2019s case was seriously flawed, the judge said, to the contrary, on the basis of his own recollection, that M\u00f3dica had been \u201cvery effective\u201d in securing the reduction of the trafficking charge, and, again, \u201cmust have been extremely forceful\u201d to gain for Thibeault the sentence that \u201clet the defendant walk on probation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b817-8\">Thus the judge denied Thibeault a new trial; and it is from the order of denial that Thibeault takes the present appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-9\">1. <em>Per se rule inapplicable. </em>It is now accepted that a person convicted of crime who has unknowingly been represented in the matter by an imposter \u2014 one pretending to be an attorney but in fact never licensed to practice anywhere \u2014 is entitled to have his or her conviction set aside, even though the representation was without a fault and as proficient as could be expected from the best of lawyers. This \u201cper se\u201d rule was acknowledged in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>399 Mass. 165, 168 (1987), and see, e.g., <em>Harrison </em>v. <em>United States, </em>387 F.2d 203, 212-213 (D.C. Cir. 1967), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number>rev\u2019d on other grounds, 392 U.S. 219 (1968); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Hoffman, </em>733 F.2d 596, 599-600 (9th Cir.) (2-1 decision), cert. denied, 469 U.S. 1039 (1984); <em>People </em>v. <em>Felder, </em>47 N.Y.2d 287, 291 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b818-5\">Judge Friendly in <em>Solina </em>v. <em>United States, </em>709 F.2d 160 (2d Cir. 1983), provides an exegesis for the rule.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Early usages show that the Sixth Amendment, where it speaks of \u201cassistance of counsel,\u201d refers to licensed practitioners. Then in <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Zerbst, </em>304 U.S. 458, 467 (1938), compliance with the assistance of counsel clause was said to be \u201can essential jurisdictional prerequisite to a federal court\u2019s authority to deprive an accused of his life or liberty\u201d and denial of assistance \u201ca jurisdictional bar to a valid conviction and sentence depriving him of his life or his liberty\u201d (at 468) cognizable on habeas corpus.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-6\">Such is the background of the per se rule for imposters, but the result does not go down easily. Judge Friendly calls the invocation of \u201cjurisdiction\u201d a \u201csomewhat surprising thesis\u201d: he adds that, had the Justices foreseen the extension of the writ, they might have reconsidered. And \u201c[t]he conclusion,\u201d Judge Friendly writes, \u201cthat we must reverse the denial of the motion to vacate Solina\u2019s conviction is one that we have reached without enthusiasm on the facts here\u201d (the facts showed overwhelming evidence of guilt and solid representation by the layman). 709 F.2d at 169. So the <em>Solina </em>opinion takes care to stress its own limits:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b818-7\">\u201cIn so construing the original understanding of the term \u2018counsel\u2019 we do not intimate that any technical defect in the licensed status of a defendant\u2019s representative would amount to a violation of the Sixth Amendment. We limit our decision in this case to situations where, unbeknown to the defendant, his representative was not authorized to practice law in any state, and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"791\">*791</page-number>lack of such authorization stemmed from failure to seek it or from its denial for a reason going to legal ability, such as failure to pass a bar examination, or want of moral character, e.g., <em>Huckelbury </em>v. <em>State, </em>337 So. 2d 400 (Fla. [Dist. Ct.] App. 1976).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 167, footnote omitted.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b819-5\">A reading of the run of cases indicates that per se treatment has been pretty well confined as stated in <em>Solina.</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Thus there is no automatic vacation of convictions where licensed attorneys have represented the defendants while under disqualifications for one or another administrative reason, say failure to pay bar dues or omission to take the formal oath upon admission.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Here falls our <em>Thomas </em>case, where the attorney was suspended for failure to register with the Board of Bar Overseers. 399 Mass. at 168-169.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The same holds where attorneys licensed in a given jurisdiction have without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"792\">*792</page-number>due authorization represented defendants in another jurisdiction.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b820-5\">In cases of the kinds just cited, there may be consciously unethical conduct where the attorney acts although aware of the administrative lapse. We go on to a handful of cases where the unethical elements in the attorneys\u2019 behavior have been more pronounced; still there is reluctance to apply a per se rule which would void criminal convictions fairly arrived at.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Plainer still is the attorney\u2019s offense to common morality in the present case \u2014 here we have the breach by the attorney of a suspension order based on his guilt of a felony (although, as the single justice noted, not an offense related to his practice of law).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b820-6\">If the question of imposing a per se rule on the present facts were to be examined afresh, we would say, first: on the assumption that there was no material mistake in Modica\u2019s advocacy on behalf of Thibeault, little convincing argument can be offered on Thibeault\u2019s part for relieving him of his just conviction and granting him a new trial; second: besides <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"793\">*793</page-number>his suspension from practice for the commission of crime, M\u00f3dica should suffer condign discipline for his violation of the suspension order. See <em>United States </em>v. Hoffman, 733 F.2d 596, 599 (9th Cir. 1984).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> We conclude that there is no occasion for bestowing an undeserved benefit on Thibeault.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-5\">2. <em>Scrutiny of attorney\u2019s conduct of criminal litigation. </em>Turning to the claim of ineffective assistance by M\u00f3dica in the usual sense of inadequate representation of the client, we agree with the suggestion that scrutiny should be particularly careful and discriminating where the attorney at the time was under suspension or other bar from practice. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Butler, </em>504 F.2d 220, 223-224 (D.C. Cir. 1974), and remarks in a dissent in the <em>Hoffman </em>case, 733 F.2d at 603-604. It should be understood that sound representation comprises not only legal proficiency on the part of the advocate but fidelity to ethical standards, and a question is instantly raised about an attorney\u2019s conduct in both aspects when he has been disciplined by suspension from practice and has then violated the suspension order. We note, too, that a contributing reason for a per se rule in the case of the imposter is that the imposter suffers a kind of conflict of interest: the imposter\u2019s own consciousness of vulnerability to exposure may affect his or her advocacy by dampening it \u2014 and perhaps in ways not easy to discern on the face of a trial transcript. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Solina, </em>709 F.2d at 164.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Similar considerations may conceivably enter into the assessment of an attorney\u2019s effectiveness in situations not governed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"794\">*794</page-number>by a per se rule. In singular cases there may be reason for redoing the criminal proceedings under better auspices.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-5\">On the present record, applying stringently the standard of <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Saferian, </em>366 Mass. 89, 96 (1974), with the ramifications mentioned, we find no basis for holding that Thibeault was represented inadequately by M\u00f3dica in the criminal proceeding.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Accordingly the order denying Thibeault a new trial should not be disturbed.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-6\">\n<em>Order affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b816-6\">There was a third charge of possession of cocaine with intent to distribute. It was dismissed on motion of the Commonwealth.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b816-7\">There was a new trial motion, which was denied, and a second, somewhat elaborated motion, also denied, and Thibeault noticed an appeal only from the former denial. The Commonwealth belabors the failure to notice an appeal from the second denial, but the point is trivial. By the second \u201cdenial\u201d the judge was saying in effect that the second version of the motion added nothing to the first that might call for a different result.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b816-8\">The Commonwealth contends upon its reading of S.J.C. Rule 4:01, \u00a7 17(4), 365 Mass. 711 (1974), that Modica\u2019s suspension did not become effective until after Thibeault was sentenced, but this is to misread the order of the single justice. Taking December 29 as the date of the suspension, Thibeault\u2019s trial and sentencing occurred within the next 28 days, the period M\u00f3dica was allowed by the single justice to wind up his affairs. Participation at trial and sentencing, particularly when the client is not informed of the suspension, hardly looks like the winding up contemplated.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-9\">The Commonwealth also speculates that M\u00f3dica may not have learned of his suspension until after Thibeault\u2019s trial and sentencing, but this appears improbable; we assume the contrary.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b817-10\">Modica\u2019s appeal from his conviction is reported as <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Modica, </em>24 Mass. App. Ct. 334 (1987).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b818-8\">In <em>Solina, </em>the person pretending to be an attorney had been graduated from an accredited law school and had passed one part of the New York bar examination but had twice failed the other part.
