Meagher and a police cruiser owned by the town of Spencer and operated by Officer George Edwards. That collision resulted in the death of Meagher. The coadministrators of Meagher\u2019s estate presented a claim in writing to the town. On October 5, 1983, they filed a complaint in the Superior Court against the town and Edwards.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b713-14\">On December 20, 1983, the town filed an answer to the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint. It denied the plaintiffs\u2019 claim and as<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>serted, as a defense, that the \u201c[p]laintiff[s] failed to give notice as required by law and the [defendant was prejudiced thereby and therefore the plaintiff[s] cannot recover.\u201d The town also alleged the failure of the plaintiffs to comply \u201cwith the [provisions of Chapter 258 of the General Laws.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">On March 28, 1988, over four years after the filing of the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint, the matter came to trial. Just before the commencement of the trial, the town filed a motion to dismiss the counts against it (see note 2, <em>supra) </em>\u201con the grounds that the plaintiffs failed to comply with the statutory condition precedent . . . prior to the commencement of the civil action. . . .\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> After a hearing the judge allowed the town\u2019s motion as to counts three and four (see note 4, <em>supra) </em>but denied it in regard to counts one and two.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-6\">The matter proceeded to trial on the two remaining counts. At the conclusion of the plaintiffs\u2019 evidence, the town moved for a directed verdict on both counts. It claimed, among other things, that \u201c[a]s a matter of law, the plaintiffs failed to satisfy the condition precedent with respect to notice and denial prior to commencement of a civil action as required by [G. L. c. 258, \u00a7 4] . . . .\u201d The town counsel\u2019s argument to the judge for allowance of the motion relevant to this appeal was short. He stated that \u201cas a matter of law the plaintiffs have failed to satisfy the condition precedent with respect to notice.\u201d The motion was denied. It was renewed at the close of all the evidence and again denied. At that time, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>the plaintiffs agreed to an entry of judgment for the town on count one (the count sought damages for pain and suffering) and the case went to the jury on count two only. The jury returned a verdict of $95,000 in favor of the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">On appeal, the town initially raised only one issue \u2014 that the judge committed error \u201cin denial of the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss and its motion for a directed verdict where the evidence clearly demonstrated that the plaintiff[s] failed to comply with the notice provisions of . . . G. L. c. 258.\u201d In its brief, the town narrowed that issue to a claim that the plaintiffs failed to comply with the \u201cpresentment\u201d requirements, in particular, by bringing their complaint before the town had denied their claim and failing to wait six months from the date of presentment.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b715-6\">According to the docket of this court, plaintiffs\u2019 counsel received the town\u2019s appellate brief on or before March 7, 1989. The plaintiffs, on March 13, 1989, filed a motion in the Superior Court to correct or modify the record. Mass.R.A.P. 8(e),.as amended, 378 Mass. 934 (1979). They requested that the following items be added to the record: (1) a copy of the town\u2019s trial brief,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> (2) a copy of a letter dated June 1, 1983, from plaintiffs\u2019 counsel to the town\u2019s board of selectmen giving notice of the plaintiffs\u2019 claim, and (3) a copy of a letter, signed by the town\u2019s attorney, denying the plaintiffs\u2019 claim. That denial letter was dated June 14, 1983, some three and one-half months <em>before </em>the plaintiffs brought their complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-7\">The plaintiffs stated, as grounds for their motion, that \u201cthe inclusion of these records in the appeal is necessary to correct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>the record on this case, to accurately reflect the facts and circumstances as they existed at the time of the trial of this matter, and to properly serve the ends of equity and justice.\u201d Counsel for the town filed a memorandum in opposition to the plaintiffs\u2019 motion to supplement the record, including an affidavit of the town\u2019s trial counsel, Mr. Paul P. O\u2019Connor. In the affidavit, Mr. O\u2019Connor stated that he was \u201cthe sole trial counsel for the . . . [town], during the hearing on the [town\u2019s] motion to dismiss, as well as the trial\u201d and that \u201c[a]t no time did plaintiffs\u2019 counsel introduce [in] evidence or offer the copies of the correspondence of June 1, 1983 [the plaintiffs\u2019 notice of its claim] and June 14, 1983 [the town\u2019s denial of that claim], which the plaintiffs now seek to add to the record.\u201d The judge allowed the plaintiffs\u2019 motion, and the town claims that such allowance was error. It has included that issue on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">The hearing on the town\u2019s motion to dismiss the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint took place in the judge\u2019s lobby prior to the commencement of the trial. It was not recorded, and therefore we have no transcript of the hearing. Further, the town has not provided \u201cany statement of the proceedings on the motion such as is permitted under Mass.R.A.P. 8(c), as appearing in 378 Mass. 932 (1979) . . . .\u201d <em>Tammaro </em>v. <em>Colarusso, </em>11 Mass. App. Ct. 44, 47 (1980). See also <em>Aronson </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>401 Mass. 244, 255 (1987). \u201cThe burden is on the appellant to provide [the appellate] court with an appendix sufficient to support its points on appeal ... .\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>One Motor Yacht Named Mercury, </em>527 F.2d 1112, 1113-1114 (1st Cir. 1975), quoted in <em>Kunen </em>v. <em>First Agricultural Natl. Bank, </em>6 Mass. App. Ct. 684, 689 (1978). Because the town failed to carry its burden, we affirm the finding, implicit in the judge\u2019s ruling, that the plaintiffs complied with all of the presentment requirements of G. L. c. 258, \u00a7 4. <em>Tammaro </em>v. <em>Colarusso, </em>11 Mass. App. Ct. at 47.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b717-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>The town faces the same problem with its claim that the judge erred in allowing the plaintiffs\u2019 motion to supplement the record. \u201cThe decision of the trial judge under rule 8(e) is usually conclusive. \u2018When a dispute respecting the record is submitted to the . . . court, its determination is conclusive, absent a showing that the . . . court has intentionally falsified the record.\u2019 \u201d <em>Letch </em>v. Daniels, 401 Mass. 65, 67-68 n.3 (1987), quoting from <em>Bechtel </em>v. <em>Paul Clark, Inc., </em>10 Mass. App. Ct. 685, 693 (1980). The town makes no showing in the record or in the appendix that the trial judge has intentionally falsified the record by allowing the rule 8(e) motion. Further, the documents that were added to the record as a result of the judge\u2019s allowance of the plaintiffs\u2019 rule 8(e) motion form an additional basis for our affirmance of the judge\u2019s denial of the motion to dismiss, as it appears that the plaintiffs did indeed comply with the requirements of G. L. c. 258, \u00a7 4.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> *8</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b713-16\">The complaint contained eight counts. The first four counts were against the town and the other four counts were against Edwards, the operator of the police cruiser. The counts against Edwards were dismissed on March 7, 1984.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b714-7\">The plaintiffs\u2019 complaint did not contain any general averment that the statutory conditions precedent to recovery under G. L. c. 258 had been performed. The town, therefore, was \u201cunder no obligation to deny the nonexistent averment \u2018specifically and with particularity\u2019, Mass.R.Civ.P. 9(c) [, 365 Mass. 751 [(1974)] ... .\u201d <em>Vasys </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Dist. Commn. </em>387 Mass. 51, 55 (1982). Further, the plaintiffs\u2019 omission allowed the town to \u201craise the issue [of noncompliance] at any time before or during trial.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b714-8\">There was no action taken by the town after the litigation commenced that would have lulled the plaintiffs into believing that presentment would not be an issue in the case. <em>Vasys, supra </em>at 57.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b714-9\">The motion also stated, as an additional ground, that counts three and four should be dismissed because they sought punitive damages against the town.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b715-8\">General Laws c. 258, \u00a7 4, \u201cprovides that a civil action shall not be instituted against a public employer on a claim for damages under this chapter unless the claimant first presents the claim in writing to the executive officer of the public employer within two years after the date on which the cause of action arose. Only if the claim is denied, or the executive officer fails to settle, arbitrate, or compromise the claim within six months of presentment may the claimant file suit.\u201d <em>McGrath </em>v. <em>Stanley, </em>397 Mass. 775, 778 (1986).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b715-9\">It was unnecessary to have the town\u2019s trial brief added to the record. It had already been included in the record as assembled by the clerk.

Because we affirm the judge\u2019s ruling denying the town\u2019s motion to dismiss the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>complaint, we need not consider the judge\u2019s actions on the town\u2019s motions for directed verdicts.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b717-8\">At oral argument, the town\u2019s counsel claimed that the June 14, 1983, letter was not an effective denial because it was not signed or sent by the proper entity, the board of selectmen. There is nothing in the record that demonstrates that the town raised that issue below. Certainly, the town never mentioned it in its reply brief. Therefore, we do not consider the town\u2019s argument. Mass.R.A.P. 16(a)(4), as amended, 367 Mass. 921 (1975).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
