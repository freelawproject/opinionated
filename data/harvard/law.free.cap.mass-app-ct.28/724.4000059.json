The defendant was charged with murdering the victim and, after a jury trial, was convicted of murder in the second degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-5\">In these appeals from his conviction and from the denial of his motion, under Mass.R.Crim.P. 25 (b)(2), 378 Mass. 896 (1979), for the entry of a verdict of guilty of manslaughter or for a new trial, the defendant makes the following claims: (1) the prosecutor, in violation of art. 12 of the Declaration of Rights of the Massachusetts Constitution and of the equal protection clause of the United States Constitution, used a peremptory challenge to exclude a black woman from the jury solely because of her race; (2) the trial judge abused his discretion in denying the defendant\u2019s rule 25(b)(2) motion that a finding of guilty of the lesser charge of manslaughter be entered; (3) the defendant is entitled to a new trial because extraneous matters affected a juror\u2019s decision; (4) impermissible conduct of the prosecutor created a substantial possibility that the verdict was influenced by sympathy for the family of the victim; and (5) a certain hearsay statement was improperly admitted in evidence and was so prejudicial that a new trial is required. We affirm the defendant\u2019s conviction and also the denial of his motions for the entry of a finding of guilty of a lesser offense and for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-6\">1. <em>Peremptory Challenge.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b753-7\">During the empanelment of the jury, the prosecutor used one of his peremptory challenges to exclude a black woman. The defendant\u2019s counsel objected, pointing out that she was the only black person on the panel. The judge asked the prosecutor for his reasons. The latter responded as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b753-8\">\u201cFirst of all, Your Honor, I would note that this is not a black on white crime. . .[both the victim and the defendant were black] She reminds me, frankly, of the defendant\u2019s mother who collapsed hysterically at the arraignment and I assume will be here continually through the trial. I\u2019m just afraid that that would affect her ability \u2014 the resemblance that I find between her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>and the mother would affect her ability to sit impartially. She is also from Cambridge and there is going to be a young woman I understand is going to testify for the defense from Cambridge. Even though she says she does not know her, I\u2019m afraid she might tend to believe that woman more who is going to represent a different view of the evidence, I assume a different view of the evidence, than witnesses who are going to be called on behalf of the Commonwealth.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b754-5\">\u201cThere is certainly no pattern of challenging jurors because of race. It\u2019s the only black on the panel at this point.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b754-6\">The defendant objected on the grounds that, despite the prosecutor\u2019s disclaimers, the only reason for the challenge was that the woman was black. He said, \u201cthe only resemblance [to the defendant\u2019s mother] is that she\u2019s black,\u201d and the witness from Cambridge also is black. The only reason \u201cyou think this [juror] might relate to her [is] because [the witness is] black.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b754-7\">The judge ruled:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b754-8\">\u201cI\u2019m not going to prevent the challenge. It\u2019s not a pattern. I think it\u2019s unfortunate that the one black juror isn\u2019t \u2014 one black potential juror won\u2019t end up sitting as a juror on this particular case. I think that\u2019s regrettable, but there is not a pattern and the government submits sufficient reason that I don\u2019t think that I should bar the peremptory challenge. It should only be done under certain carefully articulated circumstances. As I say, I feel it\u2019s unfortunate, but I\u2019m not in a position to block it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b754-9\">On the next day of trial \u2014 the jury had not yet been sworn \u2014 the prosecutor informed the judge that although the Commonwealth\u2019s position was that the peremptory challenge was exercised with appropriate reasons, he would not object to a request that the judge, in his discretion, discharge the jury and begin again simply to avoid any appearance of impropriety. The defendant rejected the offer \u201cfor the simple <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>reason that there is no guarantee that a new panel will produce any blacks, considering the situation in Middlesex County.\u201d The judge put on the record that he had ruled in the lobby that he would not start a fresh empanelment. While expressing his \u201cpersonal regret that ... the one individual who was black was excluded though a peremptory challenge,\u201d he was \u201csatisfied\u201d with the Commonwealth\u2019s reasons.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b755-5\">\u201cOne of the reasons was the Commonwealth desired to strike individuals who lived in Cambridge. I carefully monitored the Commonwealth\u2019s challenges during the empanelment process, and all but one Cambridge person were in fact challenged by the Commonwealth. For those reasons, as I said, I\u2019m not going to interfere with the process.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b755-6\">In this appeal, the defendant argues that no other reason but race explains the prosecutor\u2019s challenge. He points to the fact that, when the jury were finally selected, the panel included a white male who lived in Cambridge, another who worked there, and two female jurors of the approximate age of the defendant\u2019s mother. Moreover, he claims that the judge incorrectly thought, because only one juror was involved, that he had no authority to require the prosecutor to rescind the challenge as there was no evidence of a pattern of discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-7\">The judge\u2019s remarks, which we have quoted at length, show that he rejected a finding that the prosecutor was challenging the juror solely on the ground of her \u201cgroup membership.\u201d See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Soares, </em>377 Mass. 461, 490 (1979), cert. denied, 444 U.S. 881 (1979). He was satisfied that a neutral reason was legitimately proffered and he monitored the other challenges to potential members of the jury. All Cambridge residents except one were excluded. Contrast <em>People </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>35 Cal. 3d 161, 168-169 (1983). Although <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>the judge referred to the absence of a pattern,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> this is not a case where \u201ca single invidiously discriminatory governmental act\u201d was \u201cimmunized\u201d by the absence of \u201ca consistent pattern.\u201d See <em>Batson </em>v. Kentucky, 476 U.S. 79, 95 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b756-5\">Both the <em>Soares </em>and <em>Batson </em>opinions expressed confidence in the ability of trial judges to decide: (1) if there is a prima facie case of discrimination, <em>Soares, </em>377 Mass. at 490; <em>Batson, </em>476 U.S. at 97, in other words whether the presumption of the propriety of the peremptory challenge has been rebutted; and (2) whether there is a neutral explanation for the challenge pertaining to the individual qualities of the prospective juror. See <em>Soares, </em>377 Mass. at 491; <em>Batson, </em>476 U.S. at 98 and n. 21, but see <em>Batson, </em>at 103-104, Marshall, J., concurring. We must, therefore, give deference to the judge\u2019s decision. Although other judges might have reached a different conclusion or might have questioned the prosecutor more fully, we find no abuse of discretion here.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u201cSorting out whether a permissible or impermissible reason underlies a peremptory challenge is the function of the trial judge, and we do not substitute our judgment for his if there is support for it on the record.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Legendre, 25 </em>Mass App. Ct. 948, 949 (1988), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DiMatteo, </em>12 Mass. App. Ct. 547, 552 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b756-6\">We acknowledge the dissent\u2019s position that not very strong reasons seem to make the grade. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lattimore, </em>396 Mass. 446, 448 (1985), <em>S.C., </em>400 Mass. 1001 (1987) (peremptory challenge upheld \u201cbased on the fact that the juror was wearing a gold earring and the prosecutor did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>not \u2018like his looks\u2019 \u201d). A better rule might require a ground that would \u201capproximate\u201d a challenge for cause once an objection based on race is made to a peremptory challenge. The present law, however, is otherwise. Both the United States Supreme Court and the Supreme Judicial Court have held that the reasons need not approximate the grounds required by a challenge for cause. <em>Soares, </em>377 Mass. at 491. <em>Batson, </em>476 U.S. at 97.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-5\">2. <em>Rule 25(b)(2) Relief.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b757-6\">The defendant recognizes that his motion for either the entry of a finding of guilty of manslaughter or for a new trial on the ground that the verdict of second degree murder was against the weight of the evidence is a matter presented to the sound discretion of the trial judge. As pointed out in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Woods, </em>382 Mass. 1, 8 (1980), \u201cA trial judge\u2019s response to a new trial motion based on weight is understood to be discretionary. This entails the possibility that there may be such an abuse of discretion in a denial that an appellate court should correct the mistake on appeal [citation omitted]. Yet, granted that the possibility exists, \u2018it has repeatedly been stated that occasions when this court can do so\u2019 \u2014 set aside the action of the trial judge in refusing a new trial \u2014 \u2018are exceedingly rare.\u2019 <em>Hartmann </em>v. <em>Boston Herald Traveler Corp., </em>323 Mass. 56, 61 (1948).\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b757-7\">An examination of the evidence indicates that this is not the rare case. Inside the building, during the party, an argument erupted about taking a photograph. Angry words were exchanged and the defendant produced a knife. A number of persons were escorted outside the building and the defendant was asked to leave. Thereafter, outside on a plaza, the defendant and others engaged in a fight during the course of which the defendant fatally stabbed the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>Although the defendant contended otherwise \u2014 he gave three different statements \u2014 there was substantial evidentiary support for the judge\u2019s determination that the defendant\u2019s leaving of the building could reasonably be seen as \u201ca desire to create a physical confrontation . . . exacerbated by the fact that the defendant was apparently the only one armed with a deadly weapon\u201d and that his \u201cpost stabbing conduct of . . . yelling repeatedly T got my man, I got my man\u2019 i\u00e1 not consistent with the type of remorse that might follow manslaughter.\u201d There was also evidence from four or five witnesses that, at the time the victim was stabbed by the defendant, the arms of the victim were being held by the defendant\u2019s companions. On this basis, the judge could well conclude that there was no reasonable apprehension of danger on the part of the defendant, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>O\u2019Neil, </em>382 Mass. 12, 13 (1980), and that he should not second-guess the jury. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Millyan, </em>399 Mass. 171, 188 (1987). Unlike <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Woods, </em>382 Mass. at 8-9, the present case is one \u201cwhere much of the evidence is subject to discount for witness credibility\u201d and the \u201copinion of the judge who has heard the testimony is highly significant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b758-5\">The judge\u2019s denial of the defendant\u2019s motion was not an abuse of discretion. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gaulden, </em>383 Mass. 543, 555-556 (1981). On the evidence, the judge was entitled to conclude that the \u201cchoice of a verdict of murder in the second degree as against a verdict of manslaughter was quite understandable and reasonable.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>O\u2019Neil, </em>382 Mass. at 13. As there was ample evidence of malice, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McGuirk, </em>376 Mass. 338, 345 (1978), cert. denied, 439 U.S. 1120 (1979), the verdict was consonant with justice. That the judge commented that had he been the trier of fact, \u201cit is possible that [he] might have harbored sufficient doubt to justify a manslaughter conviction over one of second degree murder\u201d does not suggest an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>abuse of discretion in denying the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial or a reduction in the verdict.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b759-5\">3. <em>Alleged Extraneous Matter Influencing a Juror.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b759-6\">During the trial, juror No. 8 reported to a court officer that she had seen the defendant in a car, that he had motioned her to cross the street and that she was nervous over the incident. The trial judge was informed and he in turn notified both counsel of this matter. Defense counsel interviewed the defendant and corroborated the encounter. Neither counsel wished further inquiry of the juror.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-7\">After the verdict was rendered and the judge had thanked the jurors for their service, juror No. 8 told the judge \u201cthat she was concerned that seeing the defendant on the street had made her nervous and that she did not know if it affected her decision.\u201d The judge told the juror to go home, but informed counsel of her statement. Although both counsel thought no hearing should be held, the judge conducted a postverdict interview of the juror in counsels\u2019 presence. The juror stated that her verdict was based on the evidence presented at trial, but that she felt nervous about possible future repercussions.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-8\">The trial judge made comprehensive findings on this issue and concluded that \u201cthere was neither juror misconduct nor exposure to a disturbing extraneous influence which affected the impartiality of the juror.\u201d The record amply supports his findings and we agree with his conclusion. The judge could properly rely on the juror\u2019s statement that her verdict was based on the evidence. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gregory, </em>401 Mass. 437, 444 (1988). There was no error in the denial of a new trial on this ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>4. <em>Alleged Prosecutorial Misconduct in Generating Sympathy for the Victim and his Family.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b760-5\">In urging that the jury verdict may have been influenced by sympathy for the victim and his family created by impermissible conduct by the prosecutor, the defendant claims that there were three instances in which the prosecutor improperly attempted to generate sympathy: (a) in his opening statement, (b) in putting the victim\u2019s father on the stand to identify the victim when identification was not an issue; and (c) in having a member of the district attorney\u2019s victim-witness staff sit with the victim\u2019s family and hold the victim\u2019s mother\u2019s hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-6\">a) <em>Opening statement. </em>In his opening statement, the prosecutor stated that the victim did not know what was going on when he went outside and repeated this by saying, \u201cAnd poor Ignatio St. Rose didn\u2019t really know what was going on.\u201d The defendant claims that these statements were not correct because the victim knew what was going on and had been told not to go outside. Although at trial there was evidence of the victim\u2019s knowledge of the incident at the time he went outside, the evidence is not so clear as the defendant urges. There was evidence that the victim was not involved in the initial confrontation inside the party and there was some testimony that he had not been present during the group\u2019s discussion of the incident. Thus, there was in fact, evidence from which an inference can be drawn that the victim did not know what had happened. In any event, there is nothing to indicate that the prosecutor acted in bad faith in attempting to show lack of knowledge by the victim. \u201cAs a general rule, counsel is free to state in his opening anything he expects to be able to prove by evidence. If the expected testimony does not materialize, it will not be presumed that the prosecutor acted in bad faith.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Breese, </em>381 Mass. 13, 15-16 (1980). There was no error in not granting a mistrial as requested by the defendant based on the prosecutor\u2019s opening argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-7\">Moreover, the jury were informed by the judge prior to the prosecutor\u2019s opening that nothing the lawyers say \u201cconsti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>tutes evidence in the slightest.\u201d They were again instructed, in the judge\u2019s charge, that the arguments of counsel were not evidence. The judge also gave a particularly strong admonition that the jury should decide the case on the facts and not on sympathy.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fitzgerald, </em>376 Mass. 402, 424 (1978). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Francis, </em>391 Mass. 369, 373 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b761-5\">b) <em>Victim\u2019s father as witness. </em>As identification was not an issue, the defendant contends that the prosecutor\u2019s sole purpose in calling the victim\u2019s father as a witness was to generate sympathy for the victim\u2019s family. He claims that the background information supplied by the father could have been given by percipient witnesses and that this witness should not have been allowed to testify over the defendant\u2019s objection. \u201cThe Commonwealth [however] has a right to try its case in its own way so long as it engages in no calculated impropriety.\u201d See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Andrews, </em>403 Mass. 441, 451 (1988); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Easterling, </em>12 Mass. App. Ct. 226, 228 (1981).. There was here no showing of \u201ccalculated impropriety\u201d within the meaning of <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Andrews, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b761-6\">c) <em>Presence of victim advocate. </em>During the trial the victim advocate sat with the victim\u2019s mother and on at least one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>occasion, maybe more, held her hand. The defendant objected to her handholding after the prosecutor\u2019s opening. Although the judge said he would deal with the matter later on, he did not. Defense counsel renewed his objection at the end of the trial by moving for a mistrial on this ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-5\">The judge found that \u201c[i]t would have been apparent to the jury that the victim advocate was affiliated with the office of the district attorney.\u201d If the victim advocate is to perform her or his salutory duties without prejudice to the defense, an effort should be made to keep the advocate\u2019s official status under wraps. As stated by the judge, her handholding was \u201cunfortunate and avoidable.\u201d Nevertheless, in view of the evidence presented at trial and the particularly strong instructions on sympathy, see note 5, <em>supra, </em>we think this could not have affected the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-6\">5. <em>Hearsay Statement.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b762-7\">One of the students at the party, Sherea McLaughlin, told the victim that some of the persons were \u201cgetting ready to get into a fight.\u201d He asked where they were. She told him they went outside and told him not to go outside. Over the defendant\u2019s objection the prosecutor was permitted to ask her: \u201cAnd did you tell him not to go outside because they might be carrying?\u201d <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Her answer: \u201cYes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b762-8\">The witness had not seen the knife. Hence her information was derived from other sources. The defendant argues that since the witness knew the defendant from living in his neighborhood, the statement would reflect on his bad character as \u201cit would convey to the jury that, even though the witness had not seen the knife, she knew the defendant carried one.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b762-9\">The prosecutor argued to the judge that the thrust of the defendant\u2019s case was that the victim, rather than the defendant, ran outside to initiate combat. McLaughlin\u2019s testimony that the defendant or his group was \u201ccarrying\u201d was offered to show the victim\u2019s state of mind \u2014 he would be unlikely to run out and start a fight with someone who had a knife. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>think the judge, in his discretion, did not err in admitting the evidence which bore on the victim\u2019s state of mind.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">In any event, we do not think the testimony could have affected the verdict. There was ample evidence that the defendant had a knife and there was also evidence, other than McLaughlin\u2019s statement, that the victim knew that fact. Her testimony, even if it reflected on the defendant\u2019s character, was insignificant in view of the evidence at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b763-7\">\n<em>Order denying motions for a new trial or other relief affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b756-7\">As indicated in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DiMatteo, </em>12 Mass.

If exclusion of a discrete population group from a jury for no better reason than membership in such group violates art. 12 of the Declaration of Rights of the Massachusetts Constitution, the dismissal of the only member of the banished group is as repugnant to the Declaration of Rights as the dismissal of all but one member of the target group.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b756-8\">It is also significant that the defendant rejected the remedy suggested in <em>Soares, </em>377 Mass. at 491, \u201cdismissing the jurors already selected, quashing the remaining venire, and starting anew.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hutchinson, </em>395 Mass. 568, 572 (1985).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b757-8\">While the Commonwealth is correct in asserting that this court may not review the facts on its own and set aside a verdict of guilty on the ground that it is against the weight of the evidence, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Riva, </em>18 Mass. App. Ct. 713, 719 (1984), the question whether a trial judge has abused his discretion in ruling on a rule 25(b)(2) motion is reviewable by this court. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Greaves, </em>27 Mass. App. Ct. 590, 594 (1989), and cases cited.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b759-9\">The defendant points to some errors in the judge\u2019s recitation of the evidence. The judge\u2019s action on the rule 25(b)(2) motion preceded preparation of the trial transcript (consisting of fourteen volumes). After review of the transcript, we have no doubt that had the judge had the transcript, his ruling would have been the same and it would have been upheld by the panel of this court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b761-7\">The judge stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b761-8\">\u201cNow, in many cases in court there is an element of sympathy which surrounds the trial. Whenever there is a tragedy where somebody ends up as a deceased individual there is sympathy. When somebody is charged there is sympathy. We noticed here in the course of the trial there are people who are friends and family of the deceased in this case, friends and family of the defendant here, and obviously, the proceedings here and what happened almost a year ago have had a profound effect on both families. And it may well be that both families are deserving of a great deal of sympathy, but not by a jury and not by a Court, because sympathy is grounded in emotion and a jury must consider only facts, and you must put sympathy aside. And you all know that this would be a pretty sad world without sympathy, but sympathy does not have a place in the courtroom. Even more importantly, sympathy does not have a place in the jury room. You must go back, you must decide the case on the basis of the facts as you find them, disregarding emotion. You must focus on facts and facts alone.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b762-10\">The defendant takes this statement to mean carrying a knife.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b763-10\">The defendant declined to have the judge instruct the jury that the evidence was limited to the state of mind of the victim.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b763-8\">Brown, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A-0\">(dissenting). I dissent from part 1 of the majority opinion. Because of the prosecutor\u2019s shameful and flagrant misuse of the peremptory challenge to exclude a juror solely on the basis of race, the defendant did not receive a fair trial. I am shocked that in this day and age (long after the noted trilogy of cases in this area<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> 1) prosecutors are still challenging persons peremptorily for no reason other than their ethnicity. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>11 Mass. App. Ct. 288, 293-295 (1981). This is improper and immoral, apart from being unconstitutional.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b763-9\">The flimsy excuses<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> offered here were so transparent that the prosecutor, obviously embarrassed, later attempted to rectify what he seemed to acknowledge as error by sug<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>gesting to the judge that it might be prudent to \u201cdischarge the jury and begin again.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> *The question to be asked is, <em>Why did the prosecutor do itl </em>If prosecutors want trials to be fair, should not they, as well as defense counsel, try to get it right <em>the first </em>time? It should be the aim of all to strive earnestly to produce as close to an impeccable trial as is possible.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bodden, </em>24 Mass. App. Ct. 135, 141 (1987) (Brown, J., concurring). Cf. <em>Townsend </em>v. <em>Sain, </em>372 U.S. 293 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b764-5\">Let me conclude with a notion discussed by the Supreme Judicial Court in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Soares, </em>377 Mass. 461, 491, cert. denied, 444 U.S. 881 (1979), and mentioned by the majority here today. When defense counsel raises an objection based on ethnicity or gender to the prosecutor\u2019s exercise of one<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> or more peremptory challenges, the trial judge should be required to perform a more searching review of the prosecutor\u2019s reasons than is required at present, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>11 Mass. App. Ct. at 292-295, otherwise prosecutors will be \u201cfree to discriminate against blacks in jury selection provided that they hold that discrimination to an \u2018acceptable\u2019 level.\u201d <em>Batson </em>v. <em>Kentucky, </em>476 U.S. 79, 105 (1986) (Marshall, J., concurring). The trial judge should require that the prosecutor\u2019s grounds approximate or be the same as those needed to sustain a challenge for cause. See Brown, McGuire &amp; Winters, The Peremptory Challenge as Manipulative Device in Criminal Trials: Traditional Use or Abuse, 14 New England L.Rev. 192, 235 n.244 (1978). See <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>also <em>id. </em>at 233 n.236. Compare <em>Batson </em>v. <em>Kentucky, </em>476 U.S. at 107-108. (Marshall, J., concurring). If we do not make this the test,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> we will be left with a process whereby blacks are routinely excluded from juries based upon what even a dissenting Supreme Court Justice in <em>Batson </em>conceded were at best \u201ccrudely stereotypical and ... in many cases . . . hopelessly mistaken\u201d instincts. 476 U.S. at 138 (Rehnquist, J., dissenting). Justice Marshall said it best: \u201c[T]rial courts face the difficult burden of assessing prosecutor\u2019s motives. . . . Any prosecutor can easily assert facially neutral reasons for striking a juror, and trial courts are.ill-equipped to second-guess those reasons\u201d (citations omitted).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 105-106 (Marshall, J., concurring). For a case in point, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kelly, </em>10 Mass. App. Ct. 847 (1980) (explanation based on prospective juror\u2019s \u201cdemeanor, manner and the \u2018smirk on her face\u2019 \u201d found to be \u201can acceptable reason\u201d).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b763-11\">See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Soares, </em>377 Mass. 461, cert. denied, 444 U.S. 881 (1979); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sanders, </em>381 Mass. 637 (1981); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hobbs, </em>385 Mass. 863 (1982).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b763-12\">The same, of course, holds true for the use of peremptory challenges to eliminate potential jurors based solely on gender.

Crim. App. 1987). The dispute in that case concerned whether the government\u2019s explanations for three peremptory challenges were neutral and case-related. Query, what is it about the racial relationship of blacks and whites in this society that causes such fear that blacks would be unwilling to do justice when the proof supports charges such as those brought against the defendant in Tompkins'? There, the defendant, a black man, kidnapped the victim, a white person, robbed her of her automated bankteller card, tied her to a tree, and gagged her with a cloth, causing her death by suffocation.
