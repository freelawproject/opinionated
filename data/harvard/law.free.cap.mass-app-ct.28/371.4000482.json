Simmons. We discuss some evidentiary issues which the plaintiff has raised and then comment in comparatively abbreviated fashion on the residual appellate points.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">On November 17, 1978, Simmons, then age sixty-nine, suffered a stroke and was admitted to Massachusetts General Hospital. As a consequence of the stroke, Simmons is no longer able to work, he has trouble walking, and his field of vision is limited. During four weeks preceding the stroke, Simmons had complained to Dr. Yurchak about fever, fatigue, aches in his legs, chills, and headaches.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">The plaintiffs case is that Dr. Yurchak negligently failed to diagnose his patient\u2019s subacute bacterial endocarditis, an infection of the valves of the heart, and that the disease led to the stroke. The alleged causal sequence was that the suba-cute bacterial endocarditis produced a mycotic (infectious) aneurysm in the brain. As to these claims the evidence was detailed and greatly in conflict. The defense position is that: Dr. Yurchak checked for subacute bacterial endocarditis; ordered and reviewed a blood culture<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and muscle chemistry tests, among other diagnostic procedures; and reasonably arrived at a judgment that his patient was afflicted with a viral process. There was evidence that Simmons did not, indeed, have subacute bacterial endocarditis, i.e., there was no failure to diagnose that disease, and that the stroke had not been induced by an infectious aneurysm but was spontaneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-8\">The possibility of endocarditis was in the picture from the outset of the plaintiffs illness because in 1970 he had a deformed heart valve (mitral stenosis) replaced with - a prosthetic one and at that time had been treated by Dr. Yurchak, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>whose specialty is cardiology. Persons with artificial valves have a high risk of endocarditis, particularly after dental procedures. Simmons knew this and had called Dr. Yurchak to tell him he was facing a tooth extraction and had been taking penicillin. Dr. Yurchak instructed Simmons to omit his regular dosage of an anti-coagulant medication, Coumadin, and to double the dosage of oral penicillin he was taking.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">1. <em>Exclusion of hearsay about Simmons\u2019 physical condition. </em>The plaintiffs son, Stuart, testified about his own firsthand observations of his father\u2019s physical condition in the weeks preceding the stroke. Under the hearsay exception that contemporaneous expressions of pain may be admitted, the son was allowed to describe with some detail what he learned about how his father felt. See <em>Bacon </em>v. <em>Charlton, 1 </em>Cush. 581, 586 (1851); <em>Weeks </em>v. <em>Boston Elev. Ry., </em>190 Mass. 563, 565 (1906); <em>Murray </em>v. <em>Foster, </em>343 Mass. 655, 658 (1962); Liacos, Massachusetts Evidence 346 (5th ed. 1981). So it was that the son described how from November 1 to November 9, 1978, his father had experienced a burning sensation on the top of the head, pain in his tendons, and pain in his arms and legs. From November 11 to November 15, 1978, the burning sensation increased as did the pain in his tendons, with consequent increased weakness and lethargy. When he suffered the stroke, he was still weaker and lethargic, his head felt as if it were on fire, and he had pain in his muscles.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">Such specific observations and statements of physical distress, the plaintiff argues, failed to round out the picture. They lacked the spice which would give flavor to the quality of the father\u2019s illness in the period before the stroke.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>father had testified that he had felt \u201cten times worse\u201d than the flu and otherwise described his condition in poignant terms. The plaintiffs description of his condition, his counsel argues on appeal, was likely to have been discounted by the jury when pitted against that of Dr. Yurchak, a respected cardiologist at the Massachusetts General Hospital, especially as the plaintiffs memory had become impaired by his stroke.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> **4 What plaintiffs counsel proposed to the trial judge, and what he presses on appeal, is that the occasion called for application of Proposed Mass.R.Evid. 803(3), which allows receipt of hearsay statements of the declarant\u2019s then existing state of mind, emotion, sensation, or physical condition.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">\u25a0 The trial judge rightly resisted the invitation. She expressed her unease about the trustworthiness of generalized narrative statements about how a person feels which are offered for their truth, not through the declarant, but through the person to whom the statement was made, thus shielding the original statement from effective cross-examination. The judge ruled, as she would be bound to do were she operating under the proposed rules, on the question whether the capacity to mislead exceeded the probative value of the evidence offered. See Proposed Mass.R.Evid. 403. That question she resolved against receiving the statements. See <em>Ruszcyk </em>v. <em>Secretary of Pub. </em>Safety, 401 Mass. 418, 422-423 (1988). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>Between the judge\u2019s determination of untrustworthiness and the cumulative nature of what the son, Stuart, had to offer in amplification of what had already been received from him and other witnesses, there is no occasion to consider whether a more expansive hearsay exception than the existing one (i.e., expressions of pain) should have been applied.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> There is still less reason to apply \u2014 as the plaintiff also suggests \u2014 the catch-all exception to the hearsay rule which appears in Fed.R.Evid. 803(24) (1987), an exception prominently absent from the proposed Massachusetts rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">2. <em>Admissibility of videotape under G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 79C. </em>Precisely what was inducing the fever and aches which afflicted Simmons for some four weeks had not been isolated when his stroke occurred. He had what the medical profession calls a \u201cfever of unknown origin.\u201d Simmons sought, under G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 79C,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> relating to learned treatises and artiples, to place in evidence and allow to be viewed a videotape produced by the American Medical Association about \u201cfevers of unknown origin.\u201d The videotape would demonstrate how a physician should approach the diagnosis and treatment of such fevers and, presumably, would illustrate Dr. Yurchak\u2019s deviation from the norms described. The judge ruled that G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 79C, did not apply to a videotape and excluded the proffered evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>Certainly G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 79C, does not by any of its express language, extend to videotapes. That is unremarkable as videotapes did not exist in 1949, when \u00a7 79C was introduced into the statutory scheme by St. 1949, c. 183, \u00a7 1. If, in 1965, when the statute was last amended (St. 1965, c. 425), videotapes existed, they were not common currency. The plaintiff urges that the statute should be read contextually to effect its purpose and scope. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Welosky, </em>276 Mass. 398, 401-402 (1931); <em>Chipman </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Bay Transp. Authy., </em>366 Mass. 253, 256 (1974); <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Bohn, </em>377 Mass. 544, 547-551 (1979). Videotapes, the argument runs, are a contemporary variant of a published treatise, periodical, book, or pamphlet.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">One may accept that videotapes are now frequently used for informational and instructional purposes, without accepting that there is a natural line of descent, for purposes of the statute, from learned treatises, periodicals, books, and pamphlets to videotapes. Published written works, with the added protection of the statute that the author be qualified as an expert on the subject at hand,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> have an imprimatur of reliability flowing from the careful, professional criticism which attends the editorial and publishing process. So the Legislature might have determined when it enacted \u00a7 79C. See generally Kehoe, Massachusetts Malpractice Evidentiary Statute \u2014 Success or Failure?, 44 B.U.L. Rev. 10 (1964). Films, after all, were in wide use when \u00a7 79C was enacted and are not mentioned in it.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">Whether similar care is attendant on instructional videotapes we do not know. The Legislature has resources superior to ours to investigate how videotapes are produced in the scientific community, what use is made of them, and to what extent that community accepts videotapes as authoritative. There may be sufficient difference between how written materials and videotapes are prepared for publication that our adding videotapes to the list of materials in \u00a7 79C would constitute judicial legislation. Judges may not legislate sim<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>ply because a statute lacks provision for a particular event or contingency. <em>Prudential Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>369 Mass. 542, 546-547 (1976). <em>Cox </em>v. <em>Boston Consol. Gas Co., </em>67 F.Supp. 742, 744-745 (D. Mass. 1946), aff'd, 161 F.2d 680 (1st Cir. 1947).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">3. <em>Exclusion of the \u201clesser standard\u201d questions. </em>Among the witnesses whom the plaintiff called was a specialist in infectious diseases, Dr. Spivack. On two occasions, plaintiffs counsel put questions to Dr. Spivack about what might be thought to be a less refined standard of care than would be expected of one practicing cardiology, the defendant\u2019s specialty. Those questions were excluded. The first excluded question solicited Dr. Spivack\u2019s opinion whether the advice Dr. Yurchak gave to the plaintiff on August 14, 1978 (to double the dosage of oral penicillin), was in accordance with the degree of care and skill of the average qualified physician. The second excluded question inquired of Dr. Spivack how he would evaluate the performance of a medical student who had treated, as Dr. Yurchak did, a patient presenting the plaintiffs history, characteristics, and symptoms.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">Neither question reflected the standard by which a physician is to be judged in a malpractice action: \u201cwhether the physician, if a general practitioner, has exercised the degree of care and skill of the average qualified practitioner, taking into account the advances in the profession,\u201d and, if a specialist, has exercised the \u201ccare and skill of the average member of the profession practising the specialty, taking into account the advances in the profession.\u201d <em>Brune </em>v. <em>Belinkoff, </em>354 Mass. 102, 109 (1968). The resources available to the physician in each instance may be considered. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b406-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>Under the <em>Bru\u00f1e </em>formulation, which continues to guide us, each specialist who treats a patient is judged by what is the accepted standard of care and skill for that physician\u2019s field. That Dr. Spivack specialized in the diagnosis and treatment of infectious diseases did not preclude him from discoursing, if he knew, about the standard of care and skill to be expected from a cardiologist. A medical expert may testify outside his or her area of expertise so long as the \u201cwitness has sufficient \u2018education, training, experience and familiarity\u2019 with the subject matter of the testimony.\u201d <em>Letch </em>v. <em>Daniels, </em>401 Mass. 65, 68 (1987). <em>Samii </em>v. <em>Baystate Med. Center, Inc., </em>8 Mass. App. Ct. 911, 911-912 (1979). <em>Gill </em>v. <em>North Shore Radiological Associates, </em>10 Mass. App. Ct. 885, 886 (1980). This approach recognizes that a physician practicing a specialty has been trained initially, and may practice, in a broader area. Cardiology and infectious diseases, for example, are subspecialties of internal medicine.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">No doubt the plaintiff hoped to score points with the jury by his \u201cwhat would any doctor know\u201d questions. If the plaintiff could establish that not even a coarse standard of care had been met, the foundation would have been laid from which to launch an argument that a sophisticate at a tertiary care teaching hospital had surely fallen short. Questions which introduce standards of care other than those applicable to the case being tried, however, are likely to obscure the proceedings, at best, and misdirect them, at worst. The \u201clesser standard\u201d questions were rightly excluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">4. <em>Denial of certain jury instructions. </em>Among the instructions which the plaintiff requested at a charge conference were three dealing with inferences the jury might draw if they found that Dr. Yurchak had deliberately attempted to conceal facts through his office records or his hospital notes. If the jury so found, the plaintiff wished them instructed that they might take this as a manifestation that Dr. Yurchak thought he was liable for the plaintiffs injuries, i.e., a civil analog to the consciousness of guilt principle in the criminal law. See <em>Cohen </em>v. <em>Henry Siegel Co., </em>220 Mass. 215, 219 (1915); <em>Credit Serv. Corp. </em>v. <em>Barker, </em>308 Mass. 476, 481 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>(1941); <em>Hillery </em>v. <em>Hillery, </em>342 Mass. 371, 375 (1961); <em>Olofson </em>v. <em>Kilgallon, </em>362 Mass. 803, 806 (1973). The judge, after hearing argument in open court on this point, said she would not so charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">At the conclusion of the instructions, the trial judge asked the plaintiffs counsel whether he had \u201cany objections, suggestions, any corrections or any additional instructions you wish the court to give to the jury.\u201d The plaintiffs counsel offered several suggestions and requests, but did not touch on the \u201cconsciousness of liability\u201d issue which had been raised in three supplemental requests for instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">On appeal, the plaintiff argues he was entitled to take the judge\u2019s initial rejection of his proffered instructions on \u201cconsciousness of liability\u201d as preserving his rights. His position on the point had been made clear, he suggests. See <em>Caccavale </em>v. <em>Raymark Indus., Inc., </em>404 Mass. 93, 98 (1989). Yet counsel, after the charge, had asked: \u201cDo I understand the objections that both of us made earlier are saved?\u201d The judge responded: \u201cWhy don\u2019t you state them now because I have no idea what we\u2019ll do.\u201d Thereupon counsel stated his objection to the judge not having given certain enumerated instructions as requested.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The supplementary instructions regarding \u201cconsciousness of liability\u201d were not included. In the circumstances, the right to raise the \u201cconsciousness of liability\u201d issue on appeal was lost. The plaintiff did not object to the failure to give an instruction before the jury retired to consider its verdict. Mass.R.Civ.P. 51(b), 365 Mass. 816 (1974). See <em>Simon </em>v. <em>Solomon, </em>385 Mass. 91, 107 (1982); <em>Weeks </em>v. <em>Harbor Natl. Bank, </em>388 Mass. 141, 146-147 (1983); <em>Bank of Boston </em>v. <em>Haufler, </em>20 Mass. App. Ct. 668, 671 n.7 (1985); Smith &amp; Zobel, Rules Practice \u00a7\u00a7 51.5 &amp; 51.6 (1977 &amp; Supp. 1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b408-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>5. <em>Denial of motion for a new trial. </em>In support of his contention that the evidence compelled a finding that the defendant had been negligent, the plaintiff argues that all witnesses testified that good practice required Dr. Yurchak to have physically examined his patient before the plaintiff\u2019s stroke occurred. The record does not support the plaintiff\u2019s claim. At least one defense witness was quite clear that a face-to-face physical examination would have been beneficial because it would have been reassuring to the plaintiff, but that it would not have advanced diagnosis or treatment of the plaintiff\u2019s illness. That evidence warranted the jury\u2019s finding that Dr. Yurchak had not been negligent and that it was not necessary to consider causation questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">As to the weight of the evidence, which the plaintiff says warranted a new trial, there was abundant evidence that sub-acute bacterial endocarditis is often difficult to diagnose; that the plaintiff did not suffer from subacute bacterial endocarditis; and that the plaintiff\u2019s hemorrhage was spontaneous, perhaps related to anticoagulant medication which the plaintiff was required to take. It was open to the jury to find that Dr. Yurchak\u2019s care had been consistent with the standard of practice for cardiologists and that he had not been negligent. Given the conflict in the evidence, the judge did not abuse her discretion in denying the motion for a new trial. <em>Kord </em>v. <em>Baystate Med. Center, Inc., </em>13 Mass. App. Ct. 909, 910 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">\n<em>Order denying motion for new trial affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b408-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b400-9\">Drawing repetitive blood samples to culture (three to six) is the norm because one culture may not produce an accurate result.

Injections infiltrate into the blood stream at a faster rate. Evidence was received from defense experts that there was disagreement within the medical community concerning the superior wisdom and efficacy of injections and that there were risks attendant on intramuscular injection.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b401-8\">Expressions of distress which the younger Simmons was prepared to testify to \u2014 and which were excluded \u2014 the younger Simmons described in an offer of proof as follows: \u201cHe had told me how weak he felt and that he had no energy and he had no desire to do anything, and, all [in] all, he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>just didn\u2019t feel anywhere near himself.
