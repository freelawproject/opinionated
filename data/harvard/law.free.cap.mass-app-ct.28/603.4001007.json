App. Ct. 811, 819 (1985), and (2) \u201cdo not explain why, after this long-term marriage, alimony is limited to eight years.\u201d The probate judge has now filed a supplementary memorandum. Neither his original findings nor his response, however, supports the amount of the alimony award or its limited duration.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">In addition to challenging the provision for alimony, the wife claims error in the judge\u2019s valuation of marital assets and in their division. Although we might have accorded different weight to some of the evidence, we conclude that the findings as to value are not clearly erroneous and that the equitable division which gave the husband somewhat more than fifty-two percent of the marital assets<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> falls within the area of discretion of the trial judge. We reverse the portion of the judgment relating to alimony and remand for an award commensurate with the economic circumstances of the parties, such alimony to continue until there is a material change in those circumstances. See <em>Gottsegen </em>v. <em>Gottsegen, </em>397 Mass. 617, 624 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">We relate the relevant facts as found by the judge, supplemented interstitially by uncontested evidence. Dr. and Mrs. Goldman were married on February 15, 1967, and have resided in Massachusetts since 1974. At the time of the hearing, they had been married for twenty years. Mrs. Goldman was forty-six years old and Dr. Goldman forty-eight. They have two children,, a daughter, born on June 30, 1970, who lives with her father, and a son, born on November 4, 1971, who lives with his mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>Marital difficulties began when the parties moved to Springfield in 1974. Mrs. Goldman found it hard to adjust to a new community, and Dr. Goldman was unhappy in his association with a surgical group. Described by the judge as \u201csomewhat authoritarian and intolerant of behavior he viewfed] below his standards,\u201d Dr. Goldman was a workaholic who rarely had time to relax or be at home for any length of time. By his own admission, his work came before his children. Mrs. Goldman, on the other hand, was permissive. She was not interested in his career and rarely entertained.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">\u201cThe parties would get into wild and verbal arguments when Mrs. Goldman would be demeaned and degraded due to her lifestyle and careless spending, as well as the lack of discipline for the children. . . . Dr. Goldman assigned to her the job of supervision of the children during the day as well as their school studies while he worked.\u201d Characterizing Mrs. Goldman\u2019s performance in this \u201cassignment\u201d as a \u201cfailure,\u201d the judge found that Dr. Goldman\u2019s reactions were \u201cimmature and stupid.\u201d If Mrs. Goldman countermanded his directions to the children, \u201cthe war was on.\u201d Dr. Goldman became frustrated and angry, and responded \u201cverbally and physically\u201d to his wife. He also chopped up his son\u2019s bike and destroyed his skis.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">Financially, Dr. Goldman, a neurosurgeon, is most successful. His medical practice \u201ccontinues to demonstrate substantial and increasing profits each year. His practice and reputation continues to grow and will continue to grow if his health holds out.\u201d His income from all sources for the tax year 1986 was $478,560, including a $60,650 bonus from his professional corporation, but not including a contribution of approximately $69,204 paid to his pension plan by that corporation. Because his pension plan was fully funded at the time of the hearing, the money which historically has been paid into the pension plan will probably be available to him as a direct distribution of earnings in the form of increased salary or bonus. The corporation pays many of his personal expenses such as contributions and medical and travel ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>penses,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> *6and may pay him bonuses at any time of the year at his discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">Mrs. Goldman\u2019s only source of income at the time of the hearing was child support and alimony payments. Since the parties\u2019 separation, she has received $1,000 a week and indirect payments for household and medical expenses. The direct and indirect payments totaled $1,600 per week or $83,200 a year. She has not worked since before the birth of her children. She was a registered nurse, is currently unlicensed and must upgrade her skills. \u201c[T]his could be \u2018on the job training.\u2019 \u201d She applied for a job as a nurse and was offered a full-time position which she refused as she only wanted to work part-time. \u201cShe has an earning capacity of $25,000 to $30,000 a year if she desires it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">The parties did not accumulate substantial liquid assets during the marriage because of their \u201celaborate spending habits.\u201d They enjoyed a high life-style due to the earnings of Dr. Goldman and \u201clived up to the limit of his earnings.\u201d Mrs. Goldman had unlimited access to write checks on their joint checking account which the judge found \u201cshe exercised . . . with little or no restraint.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b634-7\">The judge determined that the total assets of the parties were $1,410,558 and that there were liabilities of $140,306. A summary of the judge\u2019s separate orders reveals the following division of assets:</p>\n<p id=\"b634-8\">\n<em>Mrs. Goldman</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b634-9\">Net equity in marital home................. $335,597<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b634-10\">Half interest in Maine land................. 8,750</p>\n<p id=\"b634-11\">Furniture and furnishings .................. 55,865</p>\n<p id=\"b634-12\">Jeep..................................... 5,100</p>\n<p id=\"b634-13\">Checking and savings accounts.............. 250</p>\n<p id=\"b634-14\">Lump-sum payment....................... 216,000<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b635-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>(payable $100,000 within ninety days, and thereafter \u201c$20,000 a year for a period of five (5) years and a final payment of $16,000 in year (6) at 6.5% interest per annum, commencing one year from the final</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">judgment\u201d)_</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">SUBTOTAL............................. $621,562</p>\n<p id=\"b635-7\">Less liabilities...........................

The temporary order had provided her with $1,000 a week in alimony and child support payments, but had also provided her with indirect benefits in the amount of $600.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">1. <em>Amount of alimony award. </em>No explanation can be gleaned from either the judge\u2019s original findings or his supplemental memorandum for the low alimony figure. It is not consistent with the judge\u2019s findings as to Dr. Goldman\u2019s high income and his findings concerning the couple\u2019s previous elaborate life-style.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The judge rejected the parties\u2019 statements as to need as being \u201cinflated and not realistic\u201d and stated, \u201cIt is the Court\u2019s <em>feeling </em>that Mrs. Goldman\u2019s needs will be met by a payment of alimony and support of $1,000 per week . . .\u201d (emphasis supplied). In discussing the wife\u2019s needs in his supplemental memorandum, the judge stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-6\">\u201cIt is incumbent upon the litigants to show by a preponderance of the evidence what the needs are, this they have failed to do. The mere fact that the Husband has the ability to pay does not, to my knowledge, dictate a corresponding need to receive an amount commensurate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>with such ability to pay.[<footnotemark>10</footnotemark>] It is incumbent upon a recipient spouse, in fact it is an affirmative duty, to mitigate the burdens of support by utilizing his or her financial means and earnings potential or both.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-5\">\u201cThere is no law that assures every married woman the right of a life of idleness. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Whiston, </em>306 Mass. 65, 66 [1940].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">The judge then reiterated his finding that the wife\u2019s earning capacity is in the range of $25,000 to $30,000 a year.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-7\">In his original findings, the judge found that all the income and marital assets were due to Dr. Goldman\u2019s efforts. He noted, however, that Mrs. Goldman had located the building in which Dr. Goldman maintained his practice and that she had supervised its renovations. Also, Mrs. Goldman had been \u201cassigned\u201d the responsibility of caring for the home and the children throughout the marriage. She arranged for their schooling and their extracurricular activities, attended PTA meetings, took the children to visit their grandparents, and oversaw their religious education. \u201cShe was not very successful in this endeavor, but Dr. Goldman must also share in this failure.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b637-8\">In his supplementary memorandum, the judge pointed to the fact that the marriage began to deteriorate in 1974 when their life-style was unremarkable. \u201cThis marriage partnership started its significant deterioration at about this time. [Mrs. Goldman\u2019s] non-monetary contribution to the rearing of the children and their care and supervision was a disaster.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b637-9\">Finally, in discussing Mrs. Goldman\u2019s needs with regard to her station, the judge, on remand, stated that these were adequately met, and that it was not realistic for her to retain and maintain the present eleven-room house with its attendant expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-10\">The judge\u2019s stress on the problems of the children to characterize the wife\u2019s nonmonetary contribution as a \u201cdisaster\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>and \u201cfailure\u201d is not a reason for a low alimony award. The contribution of a wife who is fully responsible for the home and children cannot be considered negative and discounted because the children have problems. This is not a case where there is evidence, or even a hint, of neglect or misfeasance on the part of Mrs. Goldman. One can only wonder at the notion that one parent can \u201cassign\u201d responsibility of children to the other, as did Dr. Goldman, and then, because the children are troubled, take as naught, or even negative, the \u201cas-signee\u2019s\u201d contribution.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">That the marriage began to deteriorate before the parties\u2019 life-style escalated is also no reason to limit alimony to the parties\u2019 earlier station. Unlike the situation in <em>Savides </em>v. <em>Savides, </em>400 Mass. 250, 252 (1987), where it was uncontested that both parties had established separate relationships and had ceased to hold themselves out to the community as husband and wife, here, despite their difficulties, the parties clearly remained married.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">Moreover, the emphasis on the wife\u2019s earning capacity based on full-time employment does not fit the circumstances. Not only has the wife not worked for eighteen years and must be retrained and relicensed, but, in view of the judge\u2019s findings, set forth in the margin,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> concerning her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>son\u2019s school difficulties, and his recent dramatic progress, her refusal to take a full-time job and her wish to work only part-time while her son is at home is not unreasonable. In these circumstances, emphasis on the full-time earning capacity of the wife and penalizing her for making a decision to be at home is not appropriate. In any event, even if the judge\u2019s figures are accurate, and the wife could earn $30,000 a year, the evidence does not suggest, and the judge\u2019s findings do not support, the conclusion that her total income would be sufficient for her to maintain her previous mode of living. See <em>Gottsegen </em>v. <em>Gottsegen, </em>397 Mass. at 623. That the judge might not have approved of the parties\u2019 life-style is irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">The evidence showed that Dr. Goldman continued to live his lavish life-style with trips to Africa and other elaborate expenditures, while Mrs. Goldman\u2019s economic condition deteriorated, even under the temporary order which, as indicated, provided $600 more a week in indirect benefits than did the final award.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">As pointed out in <em>Gottsegen </em>v. <em>Gottsegen, </em>397 Mass. at 623, the fundamental purpose of traditional alimony, namely, maintenance of a wife \u201caccording to the property and condition of her husband,\u201d <em>Coe </em>v. <em>Coe, </em>313 Mass. 232, 236 (1943), was not changed by the passage of G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 34. Quoting from <em>Grubert </em>v. <em>Grubert, </em>20 Mass. App. Ct. at 819, which in turn quoted <em>Partridge </em>v. <em>Partridge, </em>14 Mass. App. Ct. 918, 919 (1982), the Supreme Judicial Court stated in <em>Gottsegen </em>at 623-624, \u201cThe focus of any financial award must include \u2018the crucial issue in an alimony dispute, namely, the [spouse\u2019s] need for support and maintenance in relationship to the respective financial circumstances of the parties.\u2019 \u201d Absent good reason, in a long term marriage, there is no justification for the life-style of one spouse to go down while the other remains high.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b640-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>In sum, the award of alimony is not consistent with the judge\u2019s findings of Dr. Goldman\u2019s income and the parties\u2019 life-style. On remand, the judge may call for additional evidence, such as past expenditures of the wife, to show what amounts are required to allow her to maintain her previous station. Specific and detailed findings are to be made with respect to a new award of alimony which show consideration of the wife\u2019s needs in light of her station in life during the marriage.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">2. <em>Duration of award. </em>There is also no adequate explanation of the limitation of the alimony to eight years. In the early 1970\u2019s, Dr. Goldman was in a serious automobile accident. He was left with several metallic screws and pins in his lower extremities, and he suffers from swelling and pain in his right ankle. In the spring of 1987, he underwent a lumbar disk operation, and his attending physician urged him to reduce his workload and not work in excess of forty hours a week.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-6\">Both in his original memorandum and in his response to our remand, the judge stated, \u201c[Ojne would have to be hiding his head in the sand to feel that the serious injuries he has received will in no way affect his ability in the future, or that the hours he is presently putting in will continue without abatement.\u201d In his later memorandum the judge added, \u201cFurther, is it necessary or mandatory that he continue to work at his present pace so that he may maintain his wife at the present standard while she decides not to be gainfully employed?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b640-7\">Dr. Goldman\u2019s earnings have, each year, shown \u201csubstantial and increasing profits\u201d and \u201c[h]is practice and reputation continues to grow.\u201d Neither the wife\u2019s earning capacity nor the speculation as to the husband\u2019s future earnings supports the limitation of alimony to eight years. The termination of alimony at that time does not \u201cbear some relation to the financial circumstances of the parties.\u201d <em>Gottsegen </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number><em>Gottsegen, </em>397 Mass. at 624. Where future events cannot be predicted with any measure of certainty, an alimony award should be based on present conditions. A complaint for modification based on a material change in circumstances is the means for dealing with future events.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">3. <em>Equitable division. </em>We have examined the claims of the wife which relate to the equitable division, and, while there may be some question as to the valuation of some of the assets, even if there are some errors, we deem them insignificant. Cf. <em>Drapek </em>v. <em>Drapek, </em>399 Mass. 240, 247 (1987). \u201cMathematical precision is not required of equitable division of property.\u201d <em>Fechtor </em>v. <em>Fechtor, </em>26 Mass. App. Ct. 859, 861 (1989). We reject the wife\u2019s most significant claim of error in valuation, the failure of the judge to allocate any amount to the goodwill of the husband\u2019s professional corporation. The judge was warranted in accepting the husband\u2019s accountant\u2019s opinion that there was no goodwill in this one-man professional corporation. For a discussion of the classification of professional goodwill, see generally Gregory, The Law of Equitable Distribution \u00a7 6.03 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">4. <em>Conclusion. </em>The portion of the judgment as it relates to alimony is reversed, and the matter is remanded to the probate judge for a redetermination of alimony and attorneys\u2019 fees (see note 7, <em>supra) </em>consistent with this opinion. The wife is to have costs of this appeal. In all other respects, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b631-16\">The judge also ordered the husband to pay child support of $300 per week for the son of the parties, to keep in force his existing medical and hospitalization insurance for the wife and children, and to pay \u201call reasonable and necessary medical and dental expenses incurred for said minors and not covered by insurance.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b632-7\">Our remand order was issued on October 16, 1989; the judge\u2019s memorandum was received by this court on December 18, 1989, and the parties were permitted to respond to the judge\u2019s memorandum. They did so on or before January 19, 1990.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b632-8\">This percentage takes into account the liabilities of the parties found by the judge.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b634-15\">These payments were properly treated for tax purposes as distributions of earnings.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b634-16\">Mrs. Goldman is to be responsible for the payment of an outstanding mortgage of $54,000.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b634-17\">This figure takes no discount for .the present value of these future payments.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b635-28\">The liabilities of the wife do not reflect $25,805 incurred for additional legal fees and for an expert the wife hired to appraise the husband\u2019s corporation. The judge disallowed the expert\u2019s fee. He ordered Dr. Goldman to pay $30,000 of the $38,626 he found owed by the wife as attorneys\u2019 fees. (The liability figures for each of the parties takes this sum into account.) It appears that the judge only looked at one affidavit of counsel. Had he taken into account the attorneys\u2019 fees owed by the wife at the end of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>trial, in accordance with counsel\u2019s second affidavit, the amount would have been $57,431 rather than $38,626. On remand, the judge should reexamine the award of attorneys\u2019 fees taking into account the second affidavit of counsel and any additional affidavit filed by counsel for fees for the appeal to this court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b636-11\">The judge noted that the husband was incurring substantial annual schooling and psychiatric expenses (in excess of $20,000) for his daughter, adding, \u201cthe Court is convinced that the doctor will afford the same educational opportunities to the son if he is ready constructively to use such an opportunity.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b636-15\">The alimony award is approximately 7.6% of Dr. Goldman\u2019s 1986 pretax income. If, as seems likely, the amounts formerly paid toward his pension plan are paid directly to him, the amount is approximately 6.6% of his pre-tax income.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b637-11\">The judge also found, \u201cWhatever the needs are, Dr. Goldman has the necessary resources to fulfill these needs.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b638-7\">\u201cThe parties\u2019 son, . . . began to exhibit similar problems in school, as had [the daughter]. He too was sent to a private school but continued not to do well. [The son] has continued to live with Mrs. Goldman in the marital residence. During the academic year 1986-1987 he attended . . . High School and was constantly absent or tardy. As a result, he failed all of his subjects. I find that Mrs. Goldman made efforts to attempt to get him to school, including involving school authorities and the police, but due to the personal problems [the son] was experiencing she was unable to succeed. This fall, [the son\u2019s] outlook has improved dramatically and he is doing well in school, although he also is repeating a grade. He currently is receiving three A\u2019s, one B and one C in his academic courses and an additional B in an elective course. He has been absent only one day (for a Jewish holiday) and although he has been tardy on a number of days, with one or two exceptions he has missed portions only of his home room period and not any class time. This year [the son] is currently taking music lessons twice a week and working part-time after school and on weekends. Dr. Goldman admitted during his testimony that he has not seen his son since early last spring and that he has not even sent him a birthday or holiday present since the separation.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b639-7\">Although the judge suggested that the wife sell the marital home, the record does not provide factual support that this is a viable suggestion. The wife is now forty-eight, and a sale will probably result in taxable gain. See I.R.C. \u00a7\u00a7 121, 1034, 1041(b)(2) (1988). In addition, it is not clear that a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>suitable smaller shelter will cost her less, see <em>Grubert </em>v. Grubert, 20 Mass. App. Ct. at 818 n.14, or that such a move is in the interest of her son. See <em>Hartog </em>v. <em>Hartog, </em>27 Mass. App. Ct. 124 (1989).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
