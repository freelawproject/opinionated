Each <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>indictment charged that he had engaged in unnatural sexual intercourse with a fifteen year old youth (\u201cPaul\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The incidents allegedly occurred between January and April, 1981. A jury convicted the defendant of crimes set forth in both indictments. The defendant raises five issues on appeal. They are that the judge committed error in (1) permitting a police officer to give his \u201copinion\u201d that Paul\u2019s testimony was credible, (2) injecting the \u201cfresh complaint concept\u201d in the case, (3) allowing the prosecution to introduce evidence of prior bad acts of the defendant, (4) ruling that the defendant\u2019s character witnesses could be cross-examined in reference to their awareness of other allegations of sexual misconduct by the defendant, and (5) refusing to dismiss the indictments for lack of specificity.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">We summarize the evidence. On direct examination, Paul testified that in 1981 he was a member of a Boy Scout troop and that the defendant was the scoutmaster.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The first incident occurred following a scout meeting as the defendant was driving him home. Paul stated that, while he was sitting sideways on the defendant\u2019s lap and steering the defendant\u2019s sportscar upon invitation, his genitals were rubbed by the defendant. Subsequently, the defendant parked the car on a side street near Harvard Square and then unfastened and pulled down Paul\u2019s pants. Paul testified that the defendant performed fellatio on him for about fifteen minutes. After the episode, the defendant asked Paul if he was going to tell anyone. Paul said he would not. The defendant then drove him home.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">Paul testified that he told no one of the incident because he was \u201cconfused,\u201d \u201cembarrassed,\u201d \u201cscared,\u201d and \u201cjust didn\u2019t know what was right.\u201d He continued to attend scout <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>meetings because he \u201cjust wanted to try and forget it, that it wouldn\u2019t ever happen again.\u201d He said he \u201cwas confused, but . . . still for some reason trusted . . . [the defendant] because he was . . . [the] Boy Scout leader and . . . [Paul] looked up to him at that time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">According to Paul, several weeks elapsed without further incident. During this period, he and the defendant discussed prerequisites to becoming a Star Scout, and the defendant offered to assist him in obtaining the necessary merit badges. They agreed to meet on a Saturday. The defendant picked Paul up at his home in Cambridge and brought him to the defendant\u2019s apartment in Somerville. Paul stated that this was the only time he had been there. After describing the apartment, Paul stated that he and the defendant sat down on a couch in the den. The defendant then unfastened Paul\u2019s pants as well as his own and performed fellatio on Paul. He stated that the defendant next attempted, without success, to force Paul to perform fellatio on him. According to Paul, the defendant then told him to lie face down on the floor. Paul complied and the defendant lay on top of him and engaged in anal intercourse. Paul testified that after a few minutes he was able to roll over, and the defendant got off him. The defendant, who appeared to Paul to be nervous, asked Paul if he would tell anyone what happened. Again, Paul said he would not. At Paul\u2019s request the defendant drove him home. Paul testified that he told no one about the occurrences in the defendant\u2019s apartment. He withdrew from the troop a few weeks later. Paul stated that he told the defendant he was quitting as a result of increased time demands of his job, but that the real reason was because of what happened and because he hated the defendant. According to Paul, both incidents occurred between January and April, 1981.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">From the time of the incidents in 1981 until the spring of 1985, Paul remained silent. He testified that his family had moved from Cambridge to Hingham and that at some point he learned the defendant had become a Cambridge police officer. He stated that during this time the incidents with the defendant \u201cstarted to erase from [his] mind.\u201d In the spring <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>of 1985, however, he discussed the incidents, for the first time, with his sister-in-law. A few days later, he met with Sergeant Leonard Saviagno (the sergeant) of the Cambridge police department. Paul testified that during the course of a series of interviews with Sergeant Saviagno, he told him \u201ceverything\u201d about the two incidents.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">During cross-examination, defense counsel attacked Paul\u2019s credibility by focusing on his four-year delay in reporting the incidents. In addition,, defense counsel used the contents of Paul\u2019s statements to Sergeant Saviagno to probe for inconsistencies with Paul\u2019s testimony. Paul admitted he told Sergeant Saviagno that the incidents had occurred at several times different from those to which he testified in his direct examination. He also conceded a failure to inform the sergeant that the defendant had engaged in oral sex with him during the first incident. On redirect examination, Paul explained that these inconsistencies had occurred during his first interview with Sergeant Saviagno when he was nervous and did not know the sergeant.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">1. <em>The \u201copinion\u201d testimony. </em>Sergeant Saviagno was the next Commonwealth witness. He testified that he met with Paul \u201cthree or four times\u201d in the spring of 1985 and they discussed \u201csome incidents\u201d involving the defendant. The prosecutor did not ask Sergeant Saviagno for the details of those conversations. The sergeant, in concluding his testimony on direct examination, stated that as a result of his conversations with Paul \u201csome charges\u201d were brought against the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-7\">On cross-examination, defense counsel again used the contents of Paul\u2019s statements to Saviagno to reemphasize the inconsistencies in Paul\u2019s testimony. Saviagno testified that during a tape recorded interview Paul stated that the incidents could have occurred at times different from those given in his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>trial testimony. He also stated that, in the tape recorded interview, Paul had not included any reference to oral sex during the first incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">On redirect examination, Saviagno explained the method by which he and Paul, during the initial interview, attempted to narrow the possible dates of the incidents. The prosecutor then asked Saviagno about his job assignments in the Cambridge police department. Saviagno testified, over the defendant\u2019s objections, that one of his assignments was as commanding officer of the sexual assault unit and, in that capacity, he had investigated approximately 300 cases of sexual assault. Saviagno was then asked about the process used in interviewing alleged victims of sexual assaults. He testified that the process of interviewing \u201cvictims\u201d in those cases varied according to the age, demeanor, and mental state of the \u201cvictim.\u201d He stated that children, generally, would be interviewed four or five times, whereas adults were typically interviewed only two or three times. The prosecutor then engaged the witness in the following colloquy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-6\">Prosecutor: \u201cAnd, would you tell us, Sergeant, whether or not you have an opinion as to whether in your initial discussions with victims, [you] tend to get more or less than the complete details that you eventually learn regarding the incident?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-7\">Saviagno: \u201cYes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-8\">Prosecutor: \u201cAnd, would you tell us what that opinion is, Sergeant?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-9\">Defense Counsel: \u201cObjection.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-10\">The Court: \u201cOverruled. He may elaborate.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AVd\">Saviagno: \u201cThe first, usually the first meeting with the victim is a process of laying the groundwork for an interview, which is just to meet the victim, gain the victim\u2019s confidence, to reaffirm the victim that we are there to be supportive, and that the information we get is going to have to be reported and passed on to the District Attorney and get the person comfortable as to what the process is, the court process, supportive processes, psy<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>chological supports, and let the victim know exactly what they are going to have to contend with in the course of the prosecution of the case.\"</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">In response to other questions, Saviagno explained that in some cases a \u201cvictim\u201d might reveal what happened in detail at the first meeting, but in most cases \u201cvictims\u201d provide further details of the incident over the course of the interview process.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">The witness was then asked:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-7\">Prosecutor: \u201cAnd at some point in your discussions with . . . [Paul], in this case, Sergeant, did he tell you about the alleged oral sexual contact that had occurred in the car?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-8\">Defense Counsel: \u201cObjection.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-9\">Saviagno: \u201cYes; he did.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-10\">The Court: \u201cNo. She can have that.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-11\">Saviagno: \u201cYes; he did, Your Honor.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b549-12\">On appeal, the defendant claims that the Commonwealth was allowed to introduce Saviagno\u2019s opinion that \u201cthe changes in . . . [Paul\u2019s] story were consistent with the way in which truthful victims of sexual assaults relate their stories,\u201d and the admission of such testimony was error because it allowed the witness to comment on Paul\u2019s credibility. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dickinson, </em>394 Mass. 702, 706-707 (1985) ; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Triplett, </em>398 Mass. 561, 567 (1986) ; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ward, </em>15 Mass. App. Ct. 400, 401-402 (1983); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Long, </em>17 Mass. App. Ct. 707, 708 (1984), for cases where the court held that one witness cannot be asked for his opinion or cannot otherwise comment on the credibility of other witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-15\">Contrary to the defendant\u2019s assertion, Saviagno did not give his \u201copinion\u201d on Paul\u2019s credibility or on any other topic. Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wolcott, ante </em>200, 207 (1990). Clearly, one of the prosecutor\u2019s questions was in a form devised to obtain the opinion of a witness. Despite the form of the question, however, Saviagno\u2019s answer did not contain his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>opinion. Rather, his response was a description of the process used in interviewing individuals who claimed to be victims of sexual assaults.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">The limited nature of Saviagno\u2019s testimony on redirect examination distinguishes this case from the <em>Dickinson-Triplett-Ward-Long </em>line of cases. The defense had cross-examined both Paul and Saviagno regarding Paul\u2019s failure to inform the detective, at least in his initial interview, of all the details of the first sexual assault. The Commonwealth was entitled to have Saviagno explain the interview process in order that the jury could fairly evaluate Paul\u2019s initial omission. Compare <em>Kelley </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>296 Mass. 463, 465-466 (1937)(one witness allowed to testify as to reason for another witness\u2019s omission). By itself, Saviagno\u2019s testimony that in \u201cmost cases\u201d individuals remember more details at successive interviews was not a comment on Paul\u2019s credibility. At no time did he state that in his experience an individual, complaining of a sexual assault, becomes more truthful as the interviews proceed or that he thought Paul was truthful, despite the omission, because he fit the mold of \u201cmost cases.\u201d Further, the judge\u2019s prompt instruction to the jury that it is for the fact finder to determine whether an allegation of sexual assault is true (see n.4), removed any possibility of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">In sum, the record shows that Saviagno did not comment on Paul\u2019s credibility or testify to any opinions. In the circumstances, his testimony on redirect examination was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-7\">2. <em>The introduction of the \u201cfresh complaint concept\u201d into the trial. </em>At the close of the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence, the judge instructed the jury, over the defendant\u2019s objection, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>the testimony in which the \u201calleged victim . . . told Sergeant Saviagno what happened .... That kind of evidence is what we call \u2018fresh complaint evidence,\u2019 and it has a limited purpose . . . .\u201d The judge then stated that fresh complaint evidence \u201cis to corroborate the fact that he told somebody at some time about it. It doesn\u2019t establish that the crime actually happened. It only establishes and corroborates that he told somebody that the incident happened.\u201d In his final instructions, the judge again stated that the fresh complaint evidence could only be used to corroborate that Paul had complained to the police about the incidents.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">The defendant contends in his brief that the judge committed error when he \u201cinterjected the concept of \u2018fresh complaint\u2019 into . . . [the] case\u201d because Paul\u2019s statements to the police were too remote, as matter of law, to be considered fresh complaints. He further argues that, even if the evidence had been properly admitted on other grounds, it was error for the judge to characterize such evidence to the jury as fresh complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">The claim of defense counsel on appeal (he was also trial counsel) that the details of Paul\u2019s statements to Saviagno concerning the incidents were not admissible is surprising in view of what occurred at trial. It was defense counsel, not the prosecutor, who brought out such evidence. Obviously, it was a tactical decision on his part in order to expose possible inconsistencies with Paul\u2019s testimony. \u201cIn such circumstances, when a statement is used by the defendant to discredit the victim during . . . cross-examination, it may be admissible on more traditional principles without regard to the limitations that govern fresh complaint testimony.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lagacy, </em>23 Mass. App. Ct. 622, 631 (1987). Such is the case here.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-7\">Because four years elapsed between the time of the incidents and Paul\u2019s report to the police, the judge should not have instructed the jury on the doctrine of fresh complaint. Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lagacy, </em>23 Mass. App. Ct. at 625-626 &amp; n.7 (twenty-one year old victim\u2019s delay of three weeks approaches the outer extreme of admissibility). See <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Coull, </em>20 Mass. App. Ct. 955, 957 n.4 (1985)(\u201c[t]estimony as to the victim\u2019s substantive conversations three years after the events in question could not have been admitted as fresh complaint . . .\u201d). Moreover, there were no special circumstances in this case justifying an extraordinary delay. Paul was fifteen years old at the time of the alleged incidents; he lived with his family; he had virtually no contact with the defendant after the alleged incidents; and, although the defendant later became a police officer in Cambridge, three or four of Paul\u2019s relatives were also on the force.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">The defendant, however, fails to point out any prejudice that may have resulted from the giving of the instruction. The jury were informed that testimony concerning the details of Paul\u2019s complaints to Saviagno could be considered only for the limited purpose of corroboration of \u201cthe fact that the victim told somebody at sometime about [the incidents] . . . .\u201d The jury were specifically informed, more than once, that they could not use the testimony as evidence that the incidents had actually taken place. \u201cWe are unwilling to assume that the jury did not heed these instructions.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dockham, </em>405 Mass. 618, 627 (1989). Further, a reading of the entire charge demonstrates that the fresh complaint instruction did not undercut the judge\u2019s careful and complete instructions on prior inconsistent statements and their effect on credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">3. <em>The admission of testimony concerning prior bad acts of the defendant. </em>On direct examination, the prosecutor asked Paul, over the defendant\u2019s objection, \u201cWhy did you finally tell . . . [Saviagno] after all that time?\u201d Paul responded, \u201cbecause I had found out that it was still going on \u2014.\u201d The defendant, at sidebar, asked for a mistrial or at least that the answer be struck. He claimed that the question and answer alerted the jury to allegations that the defendant had been having sexual relations with other boys and that such evidence was unfairly prejudicial. The judge allowed the question and answer because he stated they were relevant to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>Paul\u2019s state of mind in coming forward with his complaint. He denied the defendant\u2019s requests.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">The Commonwealth argues, in its brief, that the question was proper because \u201cevidence of the reason for a delayed report of a rape and the circumstances of the report have long been held admissible,\u201d and cites <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rollo, </em>203 Mass. 354, 355 (1909); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Colangelo, 256 </em>Mass. 165, 166 (1926); <em>Glover </em>v. <em>Callahan, </em>299 Mass. 55, 57-58 (1937), as support for its argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">The reliance by the Commonwealth on those decisions is misplaced. They hold that a victim of rape may offer evidence that explains the reason that an earlier complaint was not made. However, they are not concerned with the subject of the question under scrutiny here, i.e., why a delayed complaint was being made at a particular time.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-7\">We agree with the defendant that the question was improper, at least on direct examination.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> 6 Paul\u2019s \u201cstate of mind\u201d in reporting the incidents about four years after they occurred was not relevant, at least on direct examination. Therefore, it was error, in the circumstances, to allow the question.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-8\">We believe that the interrupted answer of the witness does not require a new trial. The information conveyed in the answer was only stated once, in response to a single question. It was never mentioned again to the jurors. In addition, we note that the answer was ambiguous and well might have left some question in the jurors\u2019 minds as to whether what \u201cwas still going on\u201d was similar conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-9\">4. <em>Remaining issues. </em>The last two issues do not require detailed discussion. The defendant claims that the judge committed error when he ruled that, if the defendant presented evidence of his good reputation for truthfulness, then the prosecutor would be permitted to cross-examine the witnesses by asking them if they had heard specific allega<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>tions of other misconduct by the defendant. The short answer to the defendant\u2019s claim is that the judge did not make the ruling described in the defendant\u2019s brief. Further, the defendant\u2019s reputation for truthfulness was not attacked at trial. Therefore, he would not have been entitled, in any event, to present evidence of his truthful nature. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sheline, </em>391 Mass. 279, 288-289(1984) (introduction of testimony that contradicts the testimony of a defendant does not constitute an attack on the defendant\u2019s character for truthfulness).</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">The indictments described the date of the offenses as \u201cbetween January and April, 1981.\u201d The defendant argues that the indictments should have been dismissed because they were insufficiently specific. The indictments, meet the test of describing the offenses \u201cwith as much certainty as the known circumstances of the case would permit.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Burke, </em>339 Mass. 521, 523 (1959). There is nothing in the record to indicate that a more specific date could have been calculated. Further, the defendant does not present facts that demonstrate he was prejudiced in his ability to present an alibi defense. He admitted driving Boy Scouts home from meetings and letting them steer his automobile. He conceded that Paul had been .in his apartment, though he claimed never alone. He presented no evidence of lack of access to the victim. Rather, his defense was to deny the charges and do his best to impeach the victim\u2019s credibility. There was no error in the denial of the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss the indictments.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b545-7\">Two additional indictments against the defendant were returned at the same time. Those indictments charged the defendant with indecent assault and battery on two other youths who were under fourteen. After a trial, the defendant was convicted on one indictment and acquitted on the other. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Montanino, </em>27 Mass. App. Ct. 130 (1989).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b545-8\">Paul was fifteen years old at the time of the alleged incidents, nineteen years old when he first discussed and reported the incidents, and twenty-one years old at the time of the trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b547-8\">The defendant testified. He denied having engaged in any sexual acts with Paul. He also denied that Paul had ever been alone with him in his apartment and explained Paul\u2019s accurate description of the apartment\u2019s interior by stating that Paul and other Boy Scouts had regularly attended meetings there. An assistant scoutmaster corroborated the defendant\u2019s testimony about the meetings in the apartment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b550-8\">Saviagno\u2019s repeated use of the word \u201cvictims\u201d to describe those individuals was unfortunate. The judge, however, put the word in proper perspective for the jury. During defense counsel\u2019s recross-examination of Saviagno, the judge told the jury that the status of an individual complaining to the witness of sexual assaults was that of \u201c[ajlleged victim, ... I think that is safe to say, it is an alleged victim .... A person is not proved to be a victim at that point in the investigation [the interview process], obviously.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b550-9\">A moment later the judge informed the jury that \u201cwhether an allegation [of sexual assault] is true or false is for a finder of fact when it is prosecuted.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b553-10\">In view of our decision that the error was not prejudicial, we need not decide whether the question could properly have been asked on redirect examination, in light of the cross-examination of Paul. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Errington, </em>390 Mass. 875, 879-881 (1984).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
