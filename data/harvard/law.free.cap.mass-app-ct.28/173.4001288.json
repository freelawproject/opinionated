At the hearing on the motion, the judge stated that there had been so many \u201cproblems\u201d in the case that she had \u201cfelt\u201d that, if the jury returned guilty verdicts and appropriate procedural steps were taken, she would \u201cprobably grant a new trial.\u201d The judge gave four reasons which led her to harbor grave doubts that the defendant had received a fair trial: (1) a serious question whether the Commonwealth\u2019s chief witness, a police officer, had committed perjury, a question which she requested be officially investigated; (2) an evidentiary ruling which the judge concluded she should not have made as it allowed the officer to opine as to the defendant\u2019s guilt; (3) the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument in which she asked the jury to draw an inference adverse to the defendant because he failed to call a witness, a codefendant whose trial had been severed from his; and (4) the inconsistent verdicts, which the judge did not question but viewed as indicative of confusion on the part of the jurors. On appeal from the grant of the motion, the Commonwealth claims an abuse of discretion. We affirm the order and allow the defendant\u2019s request for appellate costs and attorney\u2019s fees under Mass.R.Crim.P. 30(c)(8)(B), 378 Mass. 902 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">1. <em>The Trial.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">It was the Commonwealth\u2019s position at trial, based upon the testimony of Bost\u00f3n police officer Trent W. Holland, that the defendant and one Rachel Hart were trafficking in cocaine outside the Station Cafe in Roxbury. Holland described how on April 14, 1987, he and his partner drove to the vicinity of the cafe and conducted a surveillance, with the aid of binoculars, from a Tremont Street bridge across from the Roxbury Crossing public transportation station. Holland stated that he and his partner were about 100 to 150 yards from the cafe. There was a field, and the subway stop, between the vantage point from the bridge and the cafe. The view was unobstructed because there were no buildings, only a trailer and some rolls of wire, in the field.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-7\">As he stood on the bridge looking across the field and watching the cafe, Holland related how he observed the de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>fendant standing by his vehicle parked in front of the cafe. Hart was sitting on the stoop of the front entrance. He saw that people would come up to and speak with the defendant, give him money, and he would nod towards Hart. The person and Hart would go into the cafe vestibule where the drugs were delivered.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">After four people had approached the defendant, Holland and his partner got into their vehicle, drove to the cafe, and identified themselves to the defendant and Hart. She fled into the ladies\u2019 room of the cafe. After she was escorted from the ladies\u2019 room, it was searched and cocaine was found. A search of the defendant produced $395 and a plastic bag containing marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">At the close of the Commonwealth\u2019s case and pursuant to the defendant\u2019s request, the judge announced that, after the lunch hour, the jury would be taken to . the Station Cafe area for a view. Holland also went on the view. It became apparent on the view that there were buildings situated on the land that Holland had previously described as an empty field. Hence, a viewer could seriously question whether Holland in fact could see the Station Cafe from his vantage point on the bridge.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-7\">Upon returning to the courtroom, the prosecutor asked if the Commonwealth could reopen its case and recall Holland. The prosecutor explained that, although she could present Holland as a rebuttal witness after the defendant\u2019s case, that would most likely occur the next day, when Holland would be unavailable to testify in rebuttal.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-8\">Holland now explained to the jury that the buildings they saw were not there two years earlier on the date of the crime, April 14, 1987. Moreover, Holland volunteered a fact that he had never mentioned during his earlier testimony: when he made his observations, he was standing on stanchions that were about two and a half feet in height.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On cross-examination, Holland was asked to describe exactly how the field and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>surrounding area appeared on the day he arrested the defendant. He was also asked whether, during the lunch hour just prior to the view, he had gone to the location of the field and talked with anyone there present. Holland specifically denied having done any such thing and stated that he had spent the hour on the telephone inquiring about repair work being done on his automobile.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">When trial resumed the next morning, the defendant went forward and presented the following evidence. A friend of the defendant\u2019s who had been attending his trial testified that, during the lunch break the day before, she had gone to the site in dispute. When she arrived, she saw Holland speaking with a man. Having been served with a subpoena early that very morning, that man next testified. He related that, in the early afternoon of the day before, a woman (the preceding witness) and a police officer had come to the yard of his place of employment within three minutes of each other. Both asked him the same question: how long had his business been at that location. The witness had been at that location since 1984, as had the \u201ctwo permanent structures,\u201d a gray steel warehouse and a brown \u201cprefabricated building.\u201d Two of the six portable trailers presently on the lot had been there since 1984. The witness described the officer with whom he had spoken as a \u201cslightly built\u201d black man.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">Testifying on his own behalf, the defendant related that on the day in question he had gone to the Station Cafe to cash his paycheck, as was his usual custom. After he cashed his check and left the cafe, he went outside where he ran into some men that he knew. They stood about talking for some ten minutes when two officers came over and asked everyone their names and purpose. They advised the defendant and his friends that it was a bad area and that they should stay away <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>from the \u201cplace.\u201d A woman that he did not know entered the cafe.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">When the officers asked the defendant for identification, he produced his driver\u2019s license. They told him to empty his pockets and asked about the large amount of cash he had. The defendant explained that he had just cashed his check. When the woman who had earlier entered the cafe came out, the officers asked her where she had gone. When she answered that she had gone to the ladies\u2019 room, the second officer went into the cafe. He came back out a few moments later. The woman and the defendant were then arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">2. <em>The Motion for a New Trial.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b205-7\">From our reading of the transcript, we conclude that the judge acted well within the limits of her discretion in granting a new trial. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cook, </em>380 Mass. 314, 325 (1980); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Preston, </em>393 Mass. 318, 324-325 (1984). The Commonwealth\u2019s argument that the verdict was not against the weight of the evidence misses the point. The judge recognized that the verdict was supported by the evidence. Her concerns, however, and the basis of her ruling relate to the integrity of that evidence, not its sufficiency.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-8\">As for Holland\u2019s opinion, given over the defendant\u2019s objection, that, based upon his observations from the bridge, he formed the opinion that \u201cunlawful distribution of controlled substance was being made at that location, Class B,\u201d the Commonwealth\u2019s only argument is that \u201cno change of circumstances had arisen to warrant a reversal\u201d of the ruling admitting that testimony. The judge\u2019s statement that she was in error in allowing the testimony in the first instance is supported by the law. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hesketh, </em>386 Mass. 153, 161-162 (1982), and cases and authorities therein cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-9\">We turn now to the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument in which she called for an inference adverse to the defendant with the following remark: \u201c[Tjhere were other people that he could have called as witnesses here .... He\u2019s talked with Rachel Hart since then, and she clearly knows his problem, she shared in it.\u201d However, as the prosecutor well knew, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>Hart\u2019s case had been severed from the defendant\u2019s under <em>Bruton </em>v. <em>United States, </em>391 U.S. 123 (1968), and she was awaiting trial. Characterizing her remark as a \u201cperceived impropriety,\u201d the prosecutor sought to justify it by her assessment of the defendant\u2019s credibility. She argued that Hart had made a statement to the police \u201cwhich indicated that she had a relationship\u201d with the defendant.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> *Therefore, the defendant\u2019s testimony that he did not know Hart \u201cwas a lie.\u201d We fail to see the logic of the argument, and we think the impropriety quite real rather than \u201cperceived.\u201d It follows that we see no error or abuse of discretion in the judge\u2019s conclusion that, although she instructed the jury to disregard the remark, it was \u201chighly prejudicial.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gallego, </em>27 Mass. App. Ct. 714, 720 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">3. <em>Appellate Costs and Attorney\u2019s Fees.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">By motion presented prior to oral argument before us, the defendant requests an award of costs and attorney\u2019s fees arising out of the Commonwealth\u2019s appeal. As noted at the outset, the defendant\u2019s request for relief from the verdicts was brought under rule 25(b)(2). That rule makes no provision for such an award. Compare Mass.R.Crim.P. 15(d), 378 Mass. 884 (1979), and rule 30(c)(8)(B), <em>supra. </em>It has long been held, however, that \u201cpleadings are to be treated \u2018according to their nature and substance\u2019 rather than their technical form. <em>Fabrizio </em>v. <em>U.S. Susuki Motor Corp., </em>362 Mass. 873 (1972). See <em>Kilroy </em>v. <em>O\u2019Connor, </em>324 Mass. 238, 239 (1949); <em>Menage </em>v. <em>Rosenthal, </em>187 Mass. 470, 473-474 (1905).\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Preston, </em>393 Mass. at 322-323.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-7\">As we have indicated, it is clear from the transcript of the hearing on the motion and the judge\u2019s detailed written expla<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>nation of her ruling that she did not view the verdicts as against the weight of the evidence. In granting the defendant a new trial, the judge spoke in terms of the trustworthiness of the evidence, fairness, and the interests of justice. These reasons for granting the motion are those that fall more within the scope and comprehension of rule 30(b), 378 Mass. 900 (1979), than of rule 25(b)(2). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Preston, </em>393 Mass. at 323-324. We, therefore, treat the motion as if brought under rule 30(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">Rule 30(c)(8)(B) reads, in pertinent part: \u201cAn appeal from a final order under this rule may be taken to the Appeals Court by either party. If an appeal is taken: . . . Upon written motion supported by affidavit the Appeals Court <em>may </em>determine and approve payment to the defendant of his costs of appeal together with reasonable attorney\u2019s fees, to be paid on the order of the trial court after entry of the rescript\u201d (emphasis supplied). Whether we approve the request made by motion with supporting affidavits, all in conformity with the requirements of the rule, is a matter within our discretion. See Smith, Criminal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 2093 n.l (2d ed. 1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">On the circumstances here presented, we conclude that an award to the defendant of his costs and reasonable attorney\u2019s fees is an appropriate exercise of our discretion. The circumstances upon which our conclusion rests are: the grounds upon which the order granting the new trial were based, specifically Holland\u2019s testimony and the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument; the Commonwealth\u2019s failure to assess realistically its probability of success on appeal; the Commonwealth\u2019s failure to prosecute the appeal diligently; the defendant\u2019s unrefuted assertion that, while this appeal was pending, Hart\u2019s case \u201cwas filed without a change of plea\u201d; and the fact that the defendant will have additional costs and fees upon any retrial that might occur.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-7\">We do not question the Commonwealth\u2019s right to exercise its prosecutorial discretion. In view of the above circumstances, however, we think this is an appropriate (even if rare) occasion for the exercise of our discretion to authorize <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>the award, albeit not in the amount sought. Accordingly, payment to the defendant is approved in the full amount of his costs and attorney\u2019s fees in the amount of $3,500.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">\n<em>Order granting the motion for a new trial affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b201-15\">The jury found the defendant not guilty on the indictment charging him with conspiracy to commit the crime of possession of cocaine with intent to distribute.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b203-9\">Holland had testified at a probable cause hearing and before the grand jury without mention of the fact that he made his observations while standing on stanchions two and one-half feet in height.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b204-7\">It should be remembered that Holland had represented the day before that he would be unavailable the next day. Consequently, he was not present when this witness testified. It did not escape the judge\u2019s notice, however, that, after the witness completed his testimony and left the courtroom, Holland reappeared.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b206-8\">At the hearing on the motion, the prosecutor did not refute defense counsel\u2019s statement that Hart\u2019s alleged statement implicating the defendant does not appear in any police report and that it was attributed to Hart for the first time at the defendant\u2019s probable cause hearing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b206-9\">On appeal, the Commonwealth does not argue that the remark was a proper one. Rather, the claim is the only one that can be made, that the curative instruction was sufficient. We think it appropriate to point out that appellate counsel neither tried the case nor filed the notice of appeal for the Commonwealth.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
