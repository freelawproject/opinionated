See G. L. c. 58A, \u00a7 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-14\">The taxpayer owns and operates a fish market under the name of Greer\u2019s Seafood (Greer\u2019s). Greer\u2019s sells fresh and frozen fish at retail and wholesale. In the tax years in question and for many prior years, Greer\u2019s also offered on a takeout basis cooked to order foods including clams, scallops, shrimp and french fries.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> .These were sold in different sized containers. In addition, fried fish and french fries were sold in combination on a grease-absorbing tray as \u201cfish and chips.\u201d Plastic forks and paper towels, as well as packets of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>salt, ketchup and tartar sauce were provided. There was also a soda vending machine.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">The commissioner determined that Greer\u2019s sales of fried foods constituted taxable \u201cmeals\u201d provided by a \u201crestaurant,\u201d as those terms are defined by the applicable taxing statutes.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On appeal, the board ruled that Greer\u2019s was not a restaurant and did not serve meals and, accordingly, ordered abated the taxes, interest and penalties which Greer\u2019s had paid.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The record before us includes the transcript of the hearing before the board and its findings of fact and report and opinion. See G. L. c. 58A, \u00a7 13. Our review of the board\u2019s decision is limited to questions of law. See <em>Towle </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Rev., </em>397 Mass. 599, 601 (1986). While we are bound by the board\u2019s findings of fact, see G. L. c. 58A, \u00a7 13, we may \u201cconsider whether, as a matter of law, the board\u2019s factual findings are supported by substantial evidence\u201d (citations omitted). <em>Towle </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Rev., supra </em>at 602.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">The rules governing the taxation of sales of food products for human consumption are set out in G. L. c. 64H, \u00a7 <em>6(h). </em>Such products are generally exempt from the sales tax. See <em>Commissioner of Rev. </em>v. <em>Boback, </em>12 Mass. App. Ct. 602, 605 (1981). Excepted from the exemption, however, are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>\u201cmeals\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> ***5 provided by a \u201crestaurant.\u201d See G. L. c. 64H, \u00a7 <em>6(h), </em>as appearing in St. 1977, c. 363A, \u00a7 46. \u201cA sale of food is taxable only if the food is a \u2018meal,\u2019 and food is not a meal unless it is sold by a \u2018restaurant.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commissioner of Rev. </em>v. <em>Boback, supra. </em>The taxpayer\u2019s liability in this case turns on whether Greer\u2019s cooked food operation falls within the statutory definition of a \u201crestaurant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">The general definition of a restaurant, appearing in the third paragraph of section <em>6(h), </em>is inclusive:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-6\">\u201cRestaurant shall mean any eating establishment where food, food products, or beverages are provided and for which a charge is made, including, but not limited to, a cafe, lunch counter, private or social club, cocktail lounge, hotel dining room, vending machine, and any other place or establishment where food or beverages are provided, whether stationary or mobile, temporary or permanent.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b362-7\">The definition is, however, circumscribed by specific exemptions which are relevant here and are set out in the margin.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b362-8\">Exempted from the definition of a restaurant are delicatessen, grocery, market and bakery stores. This exemption embraces the general principle that food products are not sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>ject to the sales tax. The exception to these exemptions, however, ensures that business competitors will be treated similarly with respect to sales tax liability. To the extent that delicatessens, groceries, markets or bakeries compete with restaurants, their sales are taxable as meals. The third sub-paragraph of \u00a7 <em>6(h), </em>provides: \u201c[A]ny part of a . . . stpre which [sells] dinners, luncheons . . . snacks . . . [or] other [food] commonly sold at snack bars, coffee shops or luncheon counters\u201d is to be considered a restaurant for purposes of applying the sales tax. See, e.g., <em>Seiler Corporation </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Rev., </em>384 Mass. 635, 639-640 (1981) (vending machine sales reasonably taxed as meals provided by a restaurant because they compete with restaurants); <em>Commissioner of Rev. </em>v. <em>Pat\u2019s Super Market, Inc., </em>387 Mass. 309, 310 (1982) (sandwiches sold by supermarket are taxable as meals). See also <em>Ralph\u2019s Wonder, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Rev., </em>19 Mass. App. Ct. 928, 929 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">The commissioner argues persuasively that Greer\u2019s market\u2019s take-out counter operated as a \u201crestaurant\u201d within the exception to the first exemption. Its sale of fish and chips, cooked to order and accompanied by condiments, is similar to those made at restaurants, lunch counters and snack bars. Greer\u2019s likewise competes in the separate sales of fried shrimp, scallops, clams and french fries.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">The taxpayer\u2019s principal contention is that Greer\u2019s takeout operation falls under the second statutory exemption, which provides; \u201c[Markets] . . . shall not be deemed to be restaurants under this chapter based solely on the preparation and sale of prepared meat, poultry and fish items if such sales constitute less than a major portion of the total sales of such stores.\u201d The board found as facts that Greer\u2019s take-out sales were \u201climited to prepared fish items\u201d and comprised <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>less than a major portion of total sales.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Accordingly, the board ruled that Greer\u2019s sales were exempt from taxation.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">The commissioner argues first that the board\u2019s finding that Greer\u2019s sales were limited to prepared fish items is unsupported by the evidence. He correctly points to the undisputed evidence that Greer\u2019s also sold french fries separately and in combination with fried fish. Next, he contends that the statutory exemption applies only where a market would be deemed to be a restaurant \u201cbased solely\u2019\u2019 on the preparation and sale of fish items. The board rejected this approach, stating that it did \u201cnot think that the addition of french fries to the prepared fish sales, to ensure the sale of otherwise discardable fresh fish as fish and chips, and the mere addition of several varieties of seasoning, can bring a fish market into the statutory definition of restaurant.\u201d The Legislature must be thought to have used the words \u201cbased solely on the preparation and sale of meat, poultry and fish items\u201d advisedly. The commissioner construes the wording of the statute literally, according to its plain and common meaning. This construction furthers the legislative intent to treat business competitors similarly under the statute, see, e.g., <em>Seiler Corporation </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Rev., </em>384 Mass. at 639-640. It also provides a bright line test for enforcing the statute. Interpreting the exemption according to its literal meaning ensures that stores will not fall within the definition of a restaurant unless they actually function so as to compete with restaurants, lunch counters and snack bars. The sale of prepared foods for immediate consumption, whether on or off the premises, provides such competition. The exemption reflects the Legislature\u2019s determination, however, that a store\u2019s sale of prepared meat, poultry or fish items, without more and subject to the major portion of sales limitation, would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>not result in significant competition.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> While the board and the taxpayer may be correct in their conclusion that the addition of fries and condiments is necessary to the successful marketing of fried fish, it is precisely these additions which made Greer\u2019s take-out sales competitive with similar offerings of restaurants, etc., and take them out of the \u201cbased solely\u201d exemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">A further difficulty with the board\u2019s approach is that it muddies what is otherwise a clearly expressed statutory test for application. Although in this case the board concluded that the addition of french fries, condiments, utensils and paper towels to a market\u2019s sale of fried seafood would not bring it within the definition of a restaurant, what further or different degree of deviation from the statute would be permissible before a store would become subject to tax? Adhering strictly to the express limitation set out in the statute provides for clear application and consistent results.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">We hold as matter of law that the board incorrectly decided that Greer\u2019s take-out sales were not meals provided by a restaurant and thus not subject to the sales tax.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Accordingly, the decision of the board is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b360-15\">The market had no eating facilities.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b361-7\">Greer\u2019s conceded its liability for sales taxes assessed on vending machine beverage sales.

L. c. 64B. Statute 1977, c. 363A, \u00a7\u00a7 43, 45 and 46, amended the statutory scheme by repealing c. 64B and incorporating the meals tax into the general sales tax provisions of c. 64H. The applicable statute for the disputed assessments from January, 1976, to December, 1977, is G. L. c. 64B; for those pertaining to the period from January, 1978, to August, 1983, it is G. L. c. 64H, \u00a7 6(h). There is, however, no substantive difference between the pertinent provisions of c. 64H, \u00a7 6(h), and the prior provisions of c. 64B, \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 2B, as amended by St. 1975, c. 720, \u00a7\u00a7 1 &amp; 2. For ease of reference, we refer hereafter only to G. L. c. 64H, \u00a7 6(h).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b361-9\">Greer\u2019s did not contest the commissioner\u2019s computations of tax, interest and penalties.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b362-9\">\u201cMeals\u201d are broadly defined in the second paragraph of section <em>6(h) </em>to include: \u201cany food or beverage, or both, prepared for human consumption and provided by a restaurant, where the food or beverages is intended for consumption on or off the restaurant premises, and includes food or beverages sold on a \u2018take out\u2019 or \u2018to go\u2019 basis, whether or not they are packaged or wrapped and whether or not they are taken' from the premises of the restaurant.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b362-14\">The exemptions appear in the third subparagraph of \u00a7 <em>6(h) </em>and provide: \u201c[1] [d]elicatessen, grocery, market or bakery stores shall not be considered eating establishments within the meaning of this chapter [2] except for any part of such a store which engages, in the sale of dinners, luncheons, barbecued chicken, other than barbecued chicken sold whole and unsliced, sandwiches, snacks, pizzas, and other similar items which are commonly sold at snack bars, coffee shops or luncheon counters; [3] provided further, that such stores shall not be deemed to be restaurants under this chapter based solely on the preparation and sale of prepared meat, poultry and fish items if such sales constitute less than a major portion of the total sales of such stores.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b363-7\">The taxpayer urges that without coleslaw or beans to round out Greer\u2019s offerings, its sales were not \u201cclassic\u201d New England dinners, but he does not otherwise challenge the commissioner\u2019s characterization of the takeout counter as a restaurant under the exception.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b364-6\">In the latter respect, the board relied on the commisioner\u2019s administrative rulings defining major portion of total sales as fifteen percent or more.
