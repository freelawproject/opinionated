The precise charges against the defendant, of which he was convicted, were armed robbery and assault and battery by means of dangerous weapons, a handgun and a sharp instrument.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-15\">Winding into his argument, the prosecutor had this to say:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-16\">\u201cIf you think I was unfair, vote not guilty. Because, folks, what this case is about, and it ain\u2019t about a backpack, and it ain\u2019t about fifteen bucks or a calculator or notes. It\u2019s about two thugs. He [the defendant] was one of them, lurking in the bushes on a dark street, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>waiting for some poor sucker to come by. And that sucker was Perron Sailsman. And it could have been you, and it could have been you, and it could have been me. But, it wasn\u2019t, it was Perron Sailsman. That\u2019s what this case is about. That\u2019s what violence is about. That\u2019s what crime is about. That\u2019s what\u2019s wrong in this place we call the world.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-5\">\u201cYou have something, somebody else want[s] it, and they just take it. And, if you resist, you get clobbered. And, if you fight, you get stabbed. And, if you hold onto it, you\u2019re going to get shot.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-6\">\u201cFolks, if you ever have the feeling of \u2018stop this world, I want to get off,\u2019 boy, you should have had it listening to this night, November 11th, \u201885.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-7\">\u201cPerron Sailsman, an interesting person, and I\u2019m not pointing this out for sympathy. Sympathy goes out the window, it has no part in this trial. Sympathy for Per-ron Sailsman or sympathy for him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-8\">\u201cHe sees a couple of guys up on the corner on the dark side of the street. No big thing. Comes up to them, and oh boy, oh boy, welcome to America, Perron. Here\u2019s what happens when you walk around dark streets. There\u2019s going to be somebody there to rip you off. Might I submit, a couple of punks. A couple of thugs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-9\">\u201cHe resisted a bit. And then he started getting tattooed around the head, he put his arms up. And, then he thought he got punched. Then a couple came down, and that\u2019s \u2014 boy, isn\u2019t that \u2014 I\u2019m not knocking, I\u2019m not criticizing those people. But, boy, sometimes, sometimes you\u2019re going to have to learn something. We are our brother\u2019s keepers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-10\">\u201cI\u2019m not saying they should have been heroic, but, boy, we have to start looking after each other, folks. Because, if we don\u2019t start caring about what\u2019s happening to other people, if we don\u2019t, the thugs are going to rule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>our lives. I don\u2019t know who said it, I wish it were me, but it was once said, \u2018The only way evil can conquer us, the only way, is when we surrender to it.\u2019 That couple, that female, boyfriend, or female with her, ran off when he was yelling \u2018help.\u2019 Boy, we better really think, whatever you\u2019ve heard, we better give some thought to that, folks. We are, in fact, on this planet, and we are in this boat together. Enough about the couple.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-5\">\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of things wrong with this country, folks. And we all know it. But, there\u2019s a lot of things good about it. This system isn\u2019t perfect, but I suggest, respectfully to you, it\u2019s the best there ever was. And, I suggest, respectfully, it\u2019s the best there ever will be. Because this system\u2019s governed by a couple of fundamental things, and that is a value and a respect for human dignity for all of us. Including him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-6\">\u201cIt takes, I suggest to you, courage to do as citizens what you swore a solemn oath to do. It took courage, in a sense, for Perron Sailsman. And, some of you, at various times said, \u2018That kid was a fool.\u2019 He did something to protect himself and to try to keep what was his.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-7\">\u201cWhen you\u2019re up there, and you\u2019re talking about this case, it\u2019s going to take courage, and courage, contrary to Hollywood, courage isn\u2019t exhibited in the absence of fear. Courage occurs in the presence of fear. And a person acts, although he\u2019s afraid and fearful, but he does act.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-8\">\u201cVeritas dictum. Speak the truth. He took the schoolbag, but more importantly he took human dignity. Speak the truth.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b322-9\">Taken in the aggregate, the closing argument sounded a persistent theme that the jury had a duty to confront crime in the streets bravely and to avenge the wrong done the victim. Such may be the obligation of law enforcement agencies and society, but it was not at all the task of the jury. The duty of the jury was to decide whether Willie Ward, the defendant, was an actor in a particular stabbing and robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>Evidence linking the defendant to the mugging was cogent, but not overpowering. It consisted of the victim\u2019s identification of the defendant as one of two assailants. The identification was on the basis of a picture in an array followed by a face to face identification at a pretrial hearing. Perforce, courts rely on eyewitness identification but do so conscious that such identification is significantly subject to error. See Buckhout, \u201cEyewitness Testimony,\u201d 231 Scientific Am. 23 (1974). The defense was alibi based solely on the defendant\u2019s say-so, i.e., not reinforced by any other testimony or evidence tending to prove that the defendant was elsewhere at the time of the crime. Whatever doubts the defendant\u2019s alibi testimony might have engendered could have been overborne by the rousing summons to the jury to meet the challenge of urban crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">If the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument had merely been off the point, one could shrug it off. The closing speech, however, played impermissibly on the jury\u2019s emotions and pandered to their fears. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Shelley, </em>374 Mass. 466, 470 (1978); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Clary, </em>388 Mass. 583, 591-592 (1983); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kozec, </em>399 Mass. 514, 516-517 &amp; n.5 (1987); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sevieri, </em>21 Mass. App. Ct. 745, 754-755 (1986). Prosecutors should not comment on the consequences of a verdict. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>387 Mass. 900, 910-911 (1983). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kozec, </em>399 Mass. at 517 &amp; n.6. Yet the harping on the brutality of the urban scene and the duty to come to the aid of law-abiding folk was an inferential summons to the jury to seize the occasion to help extirpate street crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">Deciding whether a prosecutor\u2019s improper closing argument is sufficiently consequential to require reversal presents an exercise in weighing factors discussed in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kozec, </em>399 Mass. at 518-519. One such factor is whether defense counsel objected. Here defense counsel was tolerant to a fault of the prosecutor\u2019s effusions.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In the circumstances, we apply a \u201csubstantial risk of a miscarriage of justice\u201d test <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>to the closing argument. <em>Id. </em>at 518 &amp; n.8. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Freeman, </em>352 Mass. 556, 563-564 (1967). We think that this fragile case, resting on a single eyewitness identification, became susceptible to serious risk of a miscarriage of justice when it was exposed to potent appeals to emotion and fear.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">Another factor is whether the trial judge neutralized the improper argument through forceful correction or curative instructions. Here the judge charged the jury to \u201cdetermine the facts . . . without prejudice, without fear, without favor; solely from a fair consideration of the evidence. ... You cannot speculate as to what might or might not have been the real facts, or allow yourself to be influenced by the popularity or the lack of popularity of the crimes charged. But, rather you must confine your deliberations to the evidence and nothing but the evidence.\u201d Somewhat later in the charge he stated that \u201carguments and statements of counsel are not evidence,\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and that the presumption of the defendant\u2019s innocence was \u201cno mere idle theory to be cast aside by the jury through mere caprice, passion, or prejudice.\u201d Near the end of the charge, he cautioned the jury \u201cnot to pick and choose what instructions you want to rely on or pay attention to.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">These instructions were surely salutary, but they were insufficiently directed against the improper comments of the prosecutor and were unlikely to counteract their poisonous effect. Out of concern that the excesses of the prosecutor may have acted as an untoward influence in the jury\u2019s deliberations, we reverse the judgment. Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Porter, </em>24 Mass. App. Ct. 694, 698 (1987); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cobb, 26 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 283, 287-288 (1988). Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Earltop, </em>372 Mass. 199, 203204 (1977); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Palmariello, </em>392 Mass. 126, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>135 (1984); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sanchez, </em>405 Mass. 369, 375 (1989); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Barros, </em>24 Mass. App. Ct. 964, 965 (1987); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Achorn, </em>25 Mass. App. Ct. 247, 250-251 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">Should the Commonwealth exercise its right to bring the defendant to trial again, we think that, in view of the uncertainty about whether a sentence was imposed in a prior and unrelated case against the defendant for shoplifting, that offense ought not to be called to the attention of the jury as a prior conviction. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rossi, </em>19 Mass. App. Ct. 257, 258-259 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">\n<em>Judgments reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b325-7\">\n<em>Verdicts set aside.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b323-7\">Indeed, defense counsel also had some comments about safe streets, but with the saving grace that the point he was laboring was that the jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>ought not to convict the wrong man out of generalized concern about urban violence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b324-8\">The judge had first given this instruction prior to the opening statements of counsel. Before closing arguments began, he had repeated it, adding, \u201c[t]he lawyers now, are going to attempt .to persuade you to see the evidence their way. That\u2019s their job to try to do that. If you\u2019re persuaded, fine. If you\u2019re not, that\u2019s all right too.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
