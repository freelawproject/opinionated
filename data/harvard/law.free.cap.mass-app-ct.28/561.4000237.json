In this action seeking damages for personal injuries, loss of consortium, and emotional distress,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the plaintiffs claimed that as a result of an incident which occurred on the premises of Post Road, Marsha Gleason sustained an irreparable injury to her right eye when a twenty-three ounce bottle of Perrier carbonated water<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> 6 exploded after she had placed it in a metal shopping cart. The plaintiffs claimed that the bottle had defects which worked together in the metal cart to cause a spontaneous explosion as Marsha was looking up at, and conversing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>with, the store manager. The defendants, on the other hand, contended that the bottle broke after some act or acts of the plaintiffs caused it to be dropped out of the cart to the floor. The defendants\u2019 theory was that Marsha looked down and was struck by a flying fragment of glass after the bottle hit the floor. Following unfavorable special jury verdicts on all counts alleging negligence and breach of implied warranty of merchantability and fitness, the plaintiffs appealed from the ensuing adverse judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">It is impossible to traverse the many volumes of transcript in this case without becoming acutely aware that Marsha Gleason has endured tremendous pain and suffering as a result of the tragic and irreparable eye injury she received. Nevertheless, after a careful review of the record and of the many claims of error,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> we conclude that no error was committed that would call for reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">1. <em>Motion for a new trial. </em>The plaintiffs\u2019 principal contention on appeal is that the trial judge erred in denying their motion for a new trial which was premised on the ground that the verdicts were against the weight of the credible evidence. Such a ruling rests in the sound discretion of the trial judge. <em>Adams </em>v. <em>United States Steel Corp., </em>24 Mass. App. Ct. 102, 103-104 (1987). See also <em>Solimene </em>v. <em>B. Grauel &amp; Co., KG, </em>399 Mass. 790, 802 (1987); <em>Kaltsas </em>v. <em>Duralite Co., 4 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 634, 639 (1976). The verdict may be set aside \u201conly if [the judge] is satisfied that the jury have failed to exercise an honest and reasonable judgment in accordance with the controlling principles of law.\u201d <em>Hartmann </em>v. <em>Boston Herald-Traveler Corp., </em>323 Mass. 56, 60 (1948). Even if the jury\u2019s verdict was a surprise, if it is supported by what the judge concludes to be credible evidence, then it should stand. See <em>Kuhlmann </em>v. <em>Hy-Crest Ranches, Inc., 4 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 542, 546 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b591-7\">The central question before the jury was what caused the bottle to rupture.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Neither the manager of Post Road, Wil<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>liam McDermott, nor the accident victim, Marsha Gleason (the only percipient witnesses other than Marsha\u2019s eighteen month old baby Erik) was able to state with certainty how the accident actually occurred. McDermott claimed that while he was speaking with Marsha about wine, he \u201cbelieve [d]\u201d he saw Erik, who was seated in a child seat in the shopping cart, handling the Perrier bottle in the cart. At some point during the conversation, the bottle ruptured. Mc-Dermott did admit that he did not know where the baby\u2019s hands were just prior to the accident and that he never actually saw the baby pick up or drop the bottle. He testified that a bottle went over the cart to the floor and a stream of foam came up, hitting Marsha in the eye as she looked down at the floor. Glass then fell from her eye. According to McDer-mott, closely following the incident, Marsha stated that \u201cher baby dropped the bottle.\u201d A customer, the store cashier, and an emergency medical technician also testified that, immediately following the injury, Marsha stated that her baby had dropped the bottle.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">Marsha, in effect, denied that Erik picked up or in any way caused the bottle to fall or break. She recalled stopping to ask McDermott a question about wine. She testified, however, that \u201c[a]t that point my baby Erik started to reach his hand behind him, like he was trying to reach one of the bottles [in the cart] behind him, so I, you know, tightened my grasp on him and I pushed the bottle that was nearest to him farther back and I said, \u2018Erik, sit still,\u2019 or something to that effect.\u201d She went on to testify that, while conversing with McDermott and looking at him, \u201cI heard a noise . . . and I saw \u2014 I had a sensation of a flash of green. I couldn\u2019t tell <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>you which one came first. It was simultaneous. It was a split second. I didn\u2019t even have a chance to blink and I felt the impact in my eye.\u201d On cross-examination Marsha admitted that the flash of green could have been the bottle going over the side of the cart. She also admitted that Erik was able to throw some things at his age and that she had to keep him from grabbing hold of things in the shopping cart.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">Favorable to the plaintiffs, there was considerable evidence tending to show that Perrier used poor manufacturing practices, e.g., failing to test glass wall thickness of its bottles, and that Perrier and Great Waters were aware of such problems and of other alleged defects in the bottles and in the bottling process, such as excessively high internal pressure in the bottles caused by overfilling and excess head space air.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> There also was evidence that several instances of exploding bottles had been reported to Great Waters. Contrary to the plaintiffs\u2019 contention, however, the evidence did not establish overwhelmingly that the bottle in this case was defective.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> On conflicting evidence, the jury made a determination between plausible alternatives. Their conclusions were not necessarily contrary to the laws of physics and nature, as the plaintiffs maintain. As the verdicts were not unreasonable or outweighed by the credible evidence, the trial judge did not abuse his discretion in denying the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">2. <em>Exclusion of evidence.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b593-7\">(a) The plaintiffs claim that the trial judge erroneously excluded certain testimony of their medical expert, Dr. Deborah Langston, an ophthalmic surgeon with substantial experience in treating severe eye trauma. The judge considered her to be a well qualified medical expert. She was al<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>lowed to testify extensively on numerous aspects of Marsha\u2019s injury and treatment, including the horizontal angle of the laceration to Marsha\u2019s eye.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The plaintiffs\u2019 counsel then posed a series of questions to the doctor, hypothetical and otherwise, four of which were excluded by the trial judge.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> In substance, the four excluded questions, which are set out in the appendix, called for a medical opinion concerning the precise nature of Marsha\u2019s injury. Following the exclusion of the first question, there was a side bar conference at which the judge indicated his grounds for exclusion as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-5\">\u201c[Judge]: If she were a pathologist in a homicide case, I would allow it, but my problem is this. That she has been given full rein, I think by me, in her specialty. . . . She could be found a person well versed in her field. This comes too close to the question, however [,] of liability, and I don\u2019t like a question of liability put to a medical expert in a hypothetical.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">The judge excluded the remaining three questions apparently on the same ground. This was error. \u201cA witness can be found qualified to express an opinion concerning some matters but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>not concerning other related matters.\u201d <em>Power Serv. Supply, Inc. </em>v. <em>E.W. Wiggins Airways, Inc., 9 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 122, 130 (1980). However, an expert witness may testify on matters within his field of expertise even if his opinion touches on the ultimate issue for the jury. See, e.g., <em>Simon </em>v. <em>Solomon, </em>385 Mass. 91, 105 (1982). Although the judge based his ruling primarily on the ground that the witness\u2019s answers would touch upon the ultimate issue, any error was harmless in the circumstances of this case. Both Dr. Langston and Marsha\u2019s immediately treating physician, Dr. Kaufman, were permitted to testify that the shard of glass which struck Marsha\u2019s eye was likely to have come from somewhere between her head and her waist. This evidence supported the plaintiffs\u2019 theory that the bottle had exploded spontaneously and not as a result of being dropped on the floor. Moreover, the judge was not required to allow the plaintiffs\u2019 expert to testify as to the direction of Marsha\u2019s gaze regardless of any assumption about the direction from which the shard of glass entered her eye. The offer of proof provided no intelligible basis on which Dr. Langston could have formed an opinion involving two unknowns.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">(b) In an effort to support the theory that the Perrier bottle had exploded spontaneously in the shopping cart as a result of a combination of factors, including overfilling, one of the plaintiffs\u2019 expert witnesses produced a bottle of Perrier water that allegedly was overfilled.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The judge did not err in excluding that bottle from evidence. As the relevance of the allegedly overfilled bottle<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> was seriously questionable, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>judge was well within his discretion in excluding it. Cf. <em>Lic. Inc. </em>v. <em>Hudson, </em>10 Mass. App. Ct. 815, 816 (1980) (judge has wide discretion in determining whether evidence is sufficiently similar to assist the jury).</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">3. <em>Effect of McDermott\u2019s earlier statements. </em>The plaintiffs maintain that the judge made a critically prejudicial error when he ruled that the deposition testimony of William Mc-Dermott, the store manager of Post Road, was not binding on the corporation under Mass.R.Civ.P. 32 (a) (2), 365 Mass. 787 (1974). We do not agree.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">\u201cThe law concerning who may properly be designated as a managing agent is sketchy. Largely because of the vast variety of factual circumstances to which the concept must be applied, the standard, like so many others in the law, remains a functional one to be determined largely on a case-by-case basis.\u201d <em>Founding Church of Scientology of Washington, D.C., Inc. </em>v. <em>Webster, </em>802 F.2d 1448, 1452 (D.C. Cir. 1986). See <em>Independent Prods. Corp. </em>v. <em>Loew\u2019s, Inc., </em>24 F.R.D. 19, 24-25 (S.D.N.Y. 1959). See also <em>Petition of Manor Inv. Co., </em>43 F.R.D. 299, 300-301 (S.D.N.Y. 1967), wherein it was stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-7\">\u201cThe test as to whether one serves in such capacity to a party so that the party may be deposed through him as a managing agent under the Rule is not the title of office, or even the lack of title, but the functions he performs in furthering its activities and interests. If he has general powers to exercise his judgment and discretion in dealing with corporate matters, he may be deemed a \u2018managing agent.\u2019 In each instance a realistic appraisal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>of his activities determines the true nature of his relationship to the corporation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">A managing agent \u201c \u2018does not act \u201cin an inferior capacity\u201d under close supervision or direction of \u201csuperior authority.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Independent, supra </em>at 25-26 (citation omitted). An employee in a supervisory position who merely performs general day-to-day maintenance or routine functions, even if on a wide scale, does not possess the type of \u201c \u2018general powers to exercise his judgment and discretion in dealing with corporate matters.\u2019 \u201d <em>Colonial Capital Co. v. General Motors Corp., 29 </em>F.R.D. 514, 516-517 (D.Conn. 1961) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">At trial the plaintiffs presented little evidence to prove Mc-Dermott was a \u201cmanaging agent.\u201d They did show that he was the day manager of the store and was in charge when John Recco, the president of Post Road, was not there. Mc-Dermott was also in charge of all buying, pricing, and scheduling. However, it is plain from the record that McDermott answered to the immediate authority of Recco.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> McDer-mott\u2019s job title of \u201cstore manager,\u201d does not make him a \u201cmanaging agent\u201d for purposes of the rule. As it reasonably could be determined that McDermott was not a \u201cmanaging agent\u201d of Post Road and that he had not been designated by Post Road under Mass.R.Civ.P. 30(b)(6), the trial judge correctly ruled that his deposition could not bind the corporation. See <em>G.T.E. Prod. Corp. </em>v. <em>Gee, </em>115 F.R.D. 67, 69 (D. Mass. 1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b597-7\">The plaintiffs also attempt to show inconsistencies in Mc-Dermott\u2019s deposition testimony, as well as certain of Post Road\u2019s answers to interrogatories alleged to have been supplied by McDermott, and his trial testimony regarding whether Marsha was looking up or down at the time of the injury and regarding the condition of the bottle as it went <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>over the side of the shopping cart. A careful reading of the portions of the record to which the plaintiffs have directed us does not bear them out.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">Post Road, in its answers to interrogatories, stated that after the bottle \u201cdropped to the floor and broke, Mr. McDer-mott observed the Perrier water and a piece of glass enter Mrs. Gleason\u2019s eye. Mrs. Gleason then leaned over and the piece of glass dropped out of her eye and onto the floor.\u201d At his deposition McDermott confirmed the accuracy of the answer and testified that he saw the liquid contents hit Marsha\u2019s eye when the contents \u201ccame up like a steady stream of foam . . .. and [he] just followed it right up.\u201d McDermott\u2019s trial testimony was that he did not see the glass itself enter Marsha\u2019s eye, but that he \u201cobserved the bottle of Perrier water come over the top of the carriage and land[] on the floor . . . then noticed the liquid going up like a stream, right up to her eye, and then . . . noticed a piece of glass fall out of her eye.\u201d He testified that Marsha had been \u201cstanding up looking at [him] talking\u201d before the accident and that he had been looking at her. When the bottle moved, he turned his attention to it, watching it descend and break, and the liquid travel up. Although McDermott testified that he did not actually see her look down, bend her head, or lean over, he had \u201cno doubt\u201d that, at the point when he saw the liquid strike her eye, Marsha was looking down at the floor.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">Post Road\u2019s answers to interrogatories also contained the statement that McDermott \u201cbelieve [d] that the Gleason baby . . . had his hand on the bottle of Perrier water. . . . [A]t the next moment the bottle . . . dropped from the shopping cart onto the floor.\u201d At his deposition, McDermott stated that this answer was truthful, and that he \u201cprobably shouldn\u2019t have\u201d used the term \u201cplaying\u201d with some bottles in the cart earlier in his deposition testimony. \u201cThe baby had his hands on the bottle.\u201d At trial, McDermott testified that his \u201cmemory today [was he] believe [d] the baby had his hands on the Perrier water and maybe other bottles playing with the bottles. . . . Now I can use [the term \u2018playing\u2019].\u201d He also testified that he did not remember the position of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>Erik\u2019s hands at the time the bottle fell. As we have noted above, it was undisputed that he had not seen Erik drop the bottle from the cart.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">Finally, at his deposition McDermott testified that he saw \u201cthree-quarters of the bottle [as it began its descent from the cart]. I don\u2019t know if I saw the whole bottle plus [the] cap and everything.\u201d Later in the deposition McDermott testified that he \u201cthought,\u201d was \u201cpretty sure,\u201d was \u201csure,\u201d and \u201cbelieve[d]\u201d he saw the whole bottle come out of the shopping cart. At trial, McDermott testified that during the bottle\u2019s descent he could see only about three-quarters of it at any given point in time, and that there was \u201c[n]o question\u201d that he saw an intact bottle descend to the floor.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">Finding no material inconsistency between the foregoing pretrial statements, which were introduced at trial, and Mc-Dermott\u2019s trial testimony, we have no occasion to discuss whether any of the complained of statements should have been deemed vicarious admissions. Cf. <em>Ruszcyk </em>v. <em>Secretary of Pub. Safety, </em>401 Mass. 418 (1988), decided after the trial in this case. Consequently, any error in the judge\u2019s instructions limiting the jury\u2019s consideration of the statements would be harmless in any event.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-7\">4. <em>Prejudicial remarks by the judge. </em>The plaintiffs also argue that the trial judge made numerous remarks and comments in the presence of the jury which prejudiced their case and warrant a new trial. However, the plaintiffs\u2019 counsel falls well short of making out \u201crepeated and combative interruptions,\u201d supposed \u201cinsensitivity\u201d toward the possible effect of his demeanor, or any other egregious behavior on the part of the trial judge. The plaintiffs\u2019 claim is based primarily on three<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> isolated instances in the course of an extremely long trial. There is no hint here of the type of conduct shown in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>the cases cited by the plaintiffs.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark>.Neither the three instances complained of nor any other conduct warrants a conclusion that the effect of the judge\u2019s \u201cremarks may have been \u2018to throw the weight of [his] opinion in the scales against the [plaintiffs].\u2019 \u201d <em>Gauntlett </em>v. <em>Medical Parameters, Inc., </em>10 Mass. App. Ct. 88, 94 (1980), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Foran, </em>110 Mass. 179, 180 (1872). See also <em>Olson </em>v. <em>Ela, </em>8 Mass. App. Ct. 165, 167-169 (1979). In any event, considering the plaintiffs\u2019 selective fragmentary references in the record, we think that \u201cthe judge\u2019s instructions to the jury tended to ameliorate any adverse effect that his remarks may have had on the jury.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fitzgerald, </em>380 Mass. 840, 847 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">5. <em>Instructions. </em>The plaintiffs also attack certain aspects of the judge\u2019s instructions. The major thrust of their complaints in this regard goes to the instructions concerning breach of warranty with respect to the shopping cart and the premises of Post Road. The instructions given correctly stated the law.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">6. <em>Other matters. </em>We have considered the plaintiffs\u2019 remaining claims and conclude they are without merit.

Wolfe, Bonfire of the Vanities 258 (1987).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b590-14\">Other claims which were voluntarily dismissed or upon which verdicts were directed for the defendants, and a third-party claim against another distributor, are not part of this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b590-15\">During the bottling process the natural carbonation in Perrier water is, in the words of a vice president of Great Waters, \u201creinforced with the spring\u2019s own carbonation to bring it up to the historical [carbonation] level found in the spring.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b591-8\">The doctrine of res ipsa loquitur was not raised.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b591-9\">Considerable time and effort were expended reconstructing the bottle from the numerous fragments in order to determine the point of fracture <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>as well as the precise amount of internal pressure in the bottle when it ruptured.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b592-7\">Robert Campana, the other emergency medical technician who responded to the scene within minutes, stated in his deposition testimony, which was read in evidence: \u201cI asked [Marsha Gleason] what happened, and she told me her daughter dropped the bottle of Perrier or something, dropped it out of the cart and it blew up and the glass hit her in the eye.\u201d The plaintiffs argue that Campana\u2019s account is unreliable since Marsha does not have a daughter. What weight to attribute to Campana\u2019s deposition testimony was for the jury to decide.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b593-8\">The plaintiffs also attempted to show that the ruptured bottle\u2019s strength had been weakened by surface abrasions which came about when the bottle was placed in contact with the metal shopping cart.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b593-9\">For example, there was testimony by the plaintiffs\u2019 expert, Dr. Caporali, and other evidence that the bottle was stronger than the average. Dr. Caporali stated that he did not find any serious scratching on the surface of the bottle which would cause the bottle to explode spontaneously under ordinary internal pressure.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b594-7\">There was testimony that when a bottle breaks, the pieces of glass travel in a parabola or curve, and at its peak a piece of glass shot from a bottle travels horizontally. There was also testimony that the laceration was horizontal across the surface of Marsha\u2019s eye, tending to indicate that the glass struck Marsha at the peak of its arc.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b594-8\">With the assent of the court and to best accommodate witnesses\u2019 schedules, several witnesses, including certain experts, testified out of anticipated order. This necessitated that some of the experts testify at length based on extensive hypotheticals concerning matters on which there was yet to be direct testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-9\">While it is clear that the scope and fullness of hypothetical questions are within the discretion of the trial judge, see <em>Cohen </em>v. <em>Maritime Transp. Co., </em>353 Mass. 760, 761 (1968); <em>LaClair </em>v. <em>Silberline Mfg. Co., </em>379 Mass. 21, 32 (1979), we believe that the judge\u2019s comments at side bar, discussed further below, indicate another rationale for exclusion beyond the form of the question. Further, \u201c[t]he matter is not one solely of reviewing the judge\u2019s exercise of discretion, when the judge wholly excludes expert testimony because of serious misunderstanding of the issues of fact upon which such expert testimony is offered or because of failure to perceive the relevance of the offered testimony.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Banuchi, </em>335 Mass. 649, 655 (1957).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b595-6\">There was no direct evidence that the bottle involved in the accident was actually overfilled. We also note that, contrary to the expert\u2019s statement that there was no difference between his bottle and the accident bottle, there was at least the difference that the closures of the bottles were not alike.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b595-7\">According to the plaintiffs, introducing the bottle was an attempt to refute Perrier\u2019s claim that it was impossible to produce an overfilled bottle in its manufacturing process, as well as to show poor quality control practices of Perrier. Although there was evidence at trial that Perrier may have had a poor quality control system, the portion of the record cited by the plaintiffs does not show that Perrier made any express claim that overfilling was an impossibility. In fact, it was the plaintiffs (at side bar) who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>made that claim. Insofar as the allegedly overfilled bottle was introduced to show poor quality control practices of Perrier, such evidence would have been cumulative.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b596-9\">Nor do we think that Post Road\u2019s failure to object to the \u201cNotice of Taking Deposition of Defendant Post Road Liquors, Inc. by and through William McDermott, Manager\u201d bars it from raising an objection at trial. See in this regard, <em>Kolb </em>v. <em>A. H. Bull S.S. Co., </em>31 F.R.D. 252, 253-255 (E.D.N.Y. 1962). The parties have not raised the question whether Mc-Dermott should have been subpoenaed in connection with his deposition, and we do not discuss it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b597-8\">Further support for this determination is evidenced by the fact that McDermott presented information to Recco to be used for answers to interrogatories and that it was Recco who turned over the incident bottle to Marsha\u2019s husband because McDermott apparently lacked the authority to do,so on his own.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b599-8\">No objections were taken in two of the instances, and the record is, at best, unclear as to whether the third had been preserved on appeal. Moreover, the force of this third claim is greatly diminished because the record indicates that the challenged comment was made at side bar, and not within the hearing of the jury, as the plaintiffs allege.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b600-9\">As noted by Post Road, \u201c[a]ny attempt to read prejudice into this [issue] borders upon the frivolous and [must be] viewed only as an attempt to reach for anything which might reverse an unfavorable jury verdict.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b600-10\">In the one instance where the judge may have made a misstatement in his instructions on warranty, the record reflects that the judge, after a colloquy at side bar, clarified the point by correctly restating the law (before the jury retired) in a manner substantially in accord with the plaintiffs\u2019 request.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b600-11\">In particular, as to any theory of liability based upon the bottle being defective and breaking on the floor, see Mass.R.A.P. 16(a)(4), as amended, 367 Mass. 921 (1975).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
