Each of the properties was rented for the 1986 summer season for use by a group of unrelated people. In five complaints for judicial review, brought pursuant to G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 17, the plaintiffs challenged decisions of the zoning board of appeals of Edgartown determining that the properties were being used as \u201ctransient residential facilities\u201d in violation of applicable provisions of the Edgartown zoning by-law and ordering that the plaintiffs cease and desist from such use. The complaints were ordered consolidated for trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-8\">The term \u201ctransient residential facility\u201d is defined in the by-law in the following way: \u201cHotel, motels [,] inns or lodging houses with a capacity of more than four guest beds, and time-sharing or time-interval ownership dwelling units.\u201d The issue throughout the litigation has been whether the properties were being used as \u201clodging houses\u201d as that term appears in the zoning by-law\u2019s definition of \u201ctransient residential facilities.\u201d The by-law does not define \u201clodging house.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b278-9\">A Superior Court judge ruled in the plaintiffs\u2019 favor on cross motions for summary judgment. The board claims on appeal that the judge\u2019s interpretation of the term \u201clodging house\u201d was too narrow. We agree that the judge\u2019s interpretation of the relevant provisions of the zoning by-law was incorrect although we do not accept the board\u2019s proposed interpretation. We explain our understanding of the meaning of the term \u201clodging house\u201d in the context of the applicable regulations and conclude that the plaintiffs were in violation of those regulations. We find no merit in the plaintiffs\u2019 contention, not ruled upon by the judge, that, should they be found to be using their property in violation of the zoning bylaw, they are entitled to the protection of G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 6, for their prior nonconforming use.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>From the complaints, discovery materials, and affidavits the judge had before him, the following facts emerge. Five properties are involved: four single family residences and one duplex which contains two dwelling units. All are located in either an R-5 or an R-20 residential district of Edgartown. \u201cTransient residential facilities\u201d are prohibited in R-20 districts and permitted in R-5 districts only with a special permit. The plaintiffs have neither applied for nor received a special permit to use any of the properties as a \u201ctransient residential facility.\u201d In an R-20 district, apart from single family use, and other described uses not relevant to this case, property may be used for \u201c[t]he leasing of rooms with not more than four boarders by a family residing on the premises . . . .\u201d Although R-5 districts are generally less restrictive than R-20 districts,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> there is no provision for leasing rooms as of right. With a special permit, however, a property owner in an R-5 district may \u201c[c]onver[t] an existing residential structure to a transient residential facility . . .\u201d or use the property for \u201c[t]he taking of boarders or the leasing of rooms by a family residing on the premises . . .\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">As was their custom for a number of years, the plaintiffs entered into leases for each of the four single family houses and each unit of the duplex for the 1986 summer season. Each of the leases provided for a set amount of rent to be paid for the entire dwelling, which was to be provided with furniture but not linen. In one lease there was one lessee; in four leases there were two lessees; and in one lease there were four lessees. The plaintiffs knew, however, at least with respect to five of the six leases, that persons, typically college students, in addition to the named lessees, would be occupying the premises and sharing the rent with the lessees. The health inspector testified at the hearings before the board of appeals that the number of occupants he and the building inspector observed in the properties ranged from six to twelve. The plaintiffs admitted occupancy of one of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>dwelling units by at least ten persons, one by nine, one by eight, one by seven, and one by five. The plaintiffs maintained that no one except the named lessees occupied the remaining property. On one of the leases, five names were listed as \u201cothers to occupy.\u201d With respect to five of the six leases, the plaintiffs admitted that occupancy by more than four unrelated persons was contemplated.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">Prior to the summer of 1986, Edgartown\u2019s building inspector and health agent jointly issued \u201cGroup House Regulations for the Town of Edgartown\u201d providing that \u201c \u2018[gjroup houses,\u2019 in which the owner-occupants or the principal renters in turn rent out beds to more than four additional persons, are considered [lodging houses, and therefore] transient residential facilities.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In July of 1986, the building inspector, after inspecting the plaintiffs\u2019 properties, ordered the plaintiffs to cease and desist from operating lodging houses in violation of the by-law. The plaintiffs appealed to the board of appeals which, in each instance, upheld the decision of the building inspector. Then the plaintiffs took their cases to the Superior Court. The judge ruled that the meaning of the term \u201clodging house\u201d must be derived from G. L. c. 140, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>\u00a7 22, as amended by St. 1973, c. 481,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and, relying upon <em>White </em>v. <em>Maynard, </em>111 Mass. 250, 253 (1872), he ruled that a \u201clodger,\u201d as opposed to a \u201ctenant,\u201d is one who has no interest in the real estate. \u201cThus, [the judge concluded,] if the leases under which the [plaintiffs] rented the properties can be seen as valid conveyances of a tenancy interest in the properties, the houses were not \u2018lodging houses\u2019 within the legal definition of that term.\u201d As each of the six leases created a valid tenancy, the judge determined that none of the properties was being used as a lodging house during the term of the lease.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">1. <em>Were the properties being used as \u201clodging </em>houses\u2019\u2019? The precise issue of the validity of the cease and desist orders for the 1986 tenancies is, in 1990, no longer a live one. The general issue of the propriety of such arrangements, however, is one that is almost certain to repeat itself annually. Instead of focusing our attention, therefore, on the particular aspects of each of the leases, we examine the basic characteristics of the arrangements described in the materials before us. Thus,, we assume, although as to at least one of the leases before us the assumption is not correct,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> that the plaintiffs\u2019 practice with respect to a piece of residential property they own is to enter into a lease for the summer months with a few individuals who reside on the property and who share it with more than four other unrelated adults who pay the tenants for the right to reside on the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">The judge erred, we think, in basing his determination that there was no \u201clodging house\u201d use solely on the fact that each property was leased to tenants who acquired the right to full <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>possession of the premises for the term of the lease. To resolve the issue it was necessary for the judge to look beyond the provisions of the leases and to determine whether those in possession, the tenants, were using the leased premises as \u201clodging houses.\u201d See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jaffe, </em>398 Mass. 50, 56 n.8 (1986). The tenants, for purpose of determining whether there was compliance with the zoning regulations, stood in the shoes of the owners.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">To determine whether the tenants were in compliance, we must first decide, as a matter of statutory construction, the .meaning of \u201clodging house.\u201d See <em>Framingham Clinic, Inc. </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Framingham, </em>382 Mass. 283, 290 (1981). Terms used in a zoning by-law should be interpreted in the context of the by-law as a whole and, to the extent consistent with common sense and practicality, they should be given their ordinary meaning. See <em>Rando </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Bedford, </em>348 Mass. 296, 297-298 (1965). The use of the plaintiffs\u2019 property by the tenants fits, in our view, well within the concept of \u201clodging houses,\u201d so construed.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">What the owners contemplated the tenants would do, and what they in fact did, was to enter into agreements with other persons whereby, in exchange for compensation, temporary living space was provided. The ordinary meaning of \u201clodging house\u201d is broad enough to include such an arrangement. Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 1329 (1971) defines a \u201clodger\u201d as \u201cone who by agreement with the owner of housing accommodations acquires no property, interest, or possession therein but only the right in accordance with the agreement to live in and occupy a room or other designated portion therein that still remains in the owner\u2019s legal possession.\u201d See Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 848 (5th ed. 1979). The Supreme Judicial Court has held, similarly, that the critical distinguishing feature of a \u201clodger\u201d is his lack of interest in real property and his contractual relationship with the owner. See <em>White </em>v. <em>Maynard, </em>111 Mass. at 253. Compare <em>Selvetti </em>v. <em>Building Inspector of Revere, </em>356 Mass. 720 (1969). Compare also <em>Gulfport </em>v. <em>Daniels, </em>231 Miss. 599, 605 (1957); <em>Township of Ewing </em>v. <em>King, </em>69 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>N.J. 67, 68-69 (1976); <em>Mercer Island </em>v. <em>Steinmann, </em>9 Wash. App. 479, 484-485 (1973). We see nothing to the contrary in the statutory definition of \u201clodging house\u201d (G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 22) on which the judge said he relied.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">Moreover, looking at the by-law as a whole, it is a fair assumption that the drafters intended to prohibit, at least without a special permit, a use which they did not expressly permit as of right in a particular zoning district. Because owners, or tenants who reside on the premises, are expressly permitted to have up to four boarders, it would be reasonable to construe the by-law as prohibiting, at least without a special permit, having more than four boarders. Such an analysis suggests, in the event of a tenancy, that a \u201clodging house\u201d exists under the zoning by-law on premises occupied by the tenants and more than four additional unrelated persons who enter into agreements with the tenants and pay them for the right to short-term occupancy of living space. We recognize that zoning is not concerned with legal relationships but with how property is used. Compare <em>CHR General, Inc. </em>v. <em>Newton, </em>387 Mass. 351, 356 (1982). Typically, however, occupancy in the manner contemplated in the plaintiffs\u2019 leases would result in use of the property which is different from that which is ordinary and expected in a single family structure.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">The board, in its argument on appeal and consistent with the \u201cGroup House Regulations for the Town of Edgartown\u201d adopted by the building inspector and the health agent, would have us construe <em>any </em>rental of property in an R:5 or an R-20 district to more than four unrelated persons as the creation of a \u201ctransient residential facility\u201d and, therefore, a violation of Edgartown\u2019s zoning by-law. Such a rental, however, may well be a permitted use. In the R-5 and R-20 districts the by-law permits, in addition to other uses not in issue, the use of a building as a \u201csingle family detached dwelling . . . .\u201d We see nothing in the by-law, except possibly the term \u201csingle family,\u201d that expressly prohibits rental of a structure in those zoning districts to a group of more than four unrelated persons, each of whom would be acquiring a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>right, as against the owner, to possess the entire premises for the entire term of the tenancy. The by-law does not define \u201cfamily.\u201d Given contemporary realities, in the absence of a definition of \u201cfamily\u201d or a provision restricting \u201csingle family\u201d use to occupancy by persons related by blood, marriage, or adoption, the term \u201csingle family use\u201d is broad enough to include at least occupancy of a dwelling by a reasonable<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> number of unrelated people who choose to share a single family structure, living together as a single housekeeping unit in a family:like situation. Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jaffe, </em>398 Mass. at 56-57 (1986).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Thus, contrary to the argument of the board, those who become tenants of the owners, even if they number more than four, are not necessarily \u201clodgers.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">2. <em>Is the plaintiffs\u2019 use of the properties as \"lodging houses\u201d protected by G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 61 </em>The plaintiffs contend that if the use of any of their properties should be deemed to be use as a \u201clodging house\u201d and, hence, as a \u201ctransient residential facility,\u201d such use predates the November, 1982, amendment to the Edgartown zoning by-law first <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>referring to \u201ctransient residential facilities.\u201d Thus, they claim, they are entitled to protection under G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 6.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The plaintiffs have the burden of showing that they are entitled to the protection of the statute. See <em>Cape Resort Hotels, Inc. </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Licensing Bd. of Falmouth, </em>385 Mass. 205, 223 n.11 (1982), and cases cited. <em>Building Inspector of Chatham </em>v. <em>Kendrick, </em>17 Mass. App. Ct. 928, 929 (1983). They must show, first, that the prior use was lawful. See <em>Selectmen of Wrentham </em>v. <em>Monson, </em>355 Mass. 715, 716 (1969). In addition, whether a current use is a protected nonconforming use depends upon \u201c[wjhether the use reflects the \u2018nature and purpose\u2019 of the use prevailing when the zoning by-law took effect . . . [wjhether there is a difference in the quality or character, as well as the degree, of use . . . [and] [wjhether the current use is \u2018different in kind in its effect on the neighborhood.\u2019 \u201d <em>Cape Resort Hotels, Inc. </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Licensing Bd. of Falmouth, </em>385 Mass. at 212, quoting from <em>Bridgewater </em>v. <em>Chuckran, </em>351 Mass. 20, 23 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">The plaintiffs have failed to show entitlement to protection under G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 6. All they have established in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>record before us is that, before the 1982 zoning amendment, some of the properties were rented to groups of more than four unrelated people. According to one affidavit from a previous owner of one of the properties, he rented it for the summer of 1982 to a group of five tenants, all of whom signed the lease, and a total of ten persons, including the lessees, occupied the house. As to the remaining properties, there are no descriptions of the prior tenancies or details about occupancy, and there is no indication whether the tenants contracted with others to provide them with living space on the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">Apart from other requirements for establishing a valid prior nonconforming use, the plaintiffs have not shown that any prior use of their properties, which under the present bylaw would be unlawful, was lawful before November of 1982. The plaintiffs have not produced the applicable zoning bylaw as it existed at the time of the amendment. Thus, the record is inadequate to enable us to pass on this issue. <em>Warren </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Amherst, </em>383 Mass. 1, 8 (1981). But even assuming that before the 1982 amendment the by-law was in its present form except for the \u201ctransient residential facility\u201d references, the plaintiffs would not prevail. Consistent with our ruling on the intent of the by-law, the \u201ctransient residential facilities\u201d provisions may be enforced against the plaintiffs for practices such as those involved in this appeal only if there is a showing by the town that the plaintiffs\u2019 tenants, for compensation, agreed to allow more than four other unrelated persons to occupy living space on the premises. Such additional occupants would be \u201clodgers\u201d or \u201cboarders.\u201d The zoning by-law, even apart from the \u201ctransient residential facilities\u201d provision, does not permit a \u201cfamily\u201d in occupancy, whether owners or renters, to have more than four boarders in an R-20 district. The zoning by-law appears not to permit <em>any </em>boarders without a special permit in an R-5 district, but certainly it does not as of right permit more than four boarders. Thus, as to any use which would at the present time be in violation of the \u201ctransient residential facility\u201d provisions, any prior similar use would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>have been illegal. In particular, the use during the summer of 1982 of the one property described in the former owner\u2019s affidavit would have been violative of the zoning regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">Accordingly, we vacate four of the five judgments for the plaintiffs and order entry of judgments in those cases (Civil Action Nos. 2525, 2527, 2540, and 2541) affirming the decisions of the zoning board of appeals of Edgartown. In the remaining case (Civil Action No. 2526), in which the defendants have not shown any violation, the judgment of the Superior Court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b279-6\">In an R-20 district, the minimum lot size is a half acre.
