(Duddie Ford),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> was convicted on twelve indictments charging larceny by a false pretense to induce another to part with property in violation of G. L. c. 266, \u00a7 34, and on twelve indictments charging larceny by a false statement in writing to obtain credit in violation of G. L. c. 266, \u00a7 33.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Duddie Ford was sentenced to a $500 fine and $125 surfine on each of the convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-10\">The Commonwealth presented evidence that, in 1984, loans for the purchase of automobiles by twelve customers of Duddie Ford had been obtained by fraudulent means from the Watertown branch of the Coolidge Bank &amp; Trust Company (the bank). Maintaining that the financial information<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>submitted to the bank for the loans proved the existence of a \u201cscam\u201d with substantial benefit accruing to Duddie Ford, the Commonwealth contended that the defendant Nedder, employed as a salesman by Duddie Ford, obtained automobile loans for customers who were poor credit risks by, among other things, misrepresenting the customers\u2019 income, current employment, work history, down payments and trade-ins.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Because of inflated price figures supplied to it, the bank issued checks at the loan closings made out jointly to the customers and Duddie Ford in amounts greater than the actual prices of the automobiles financed. The Commonwealth alleged that certain Duddie Ford employees endorsed the checks and made out separate overage checks to the customers for the amounts of the excess. The overage checks were later, negotiated (sometimes under forged endorsements), but the customers did not, in most cases, receive any proceeds.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">1. <em>Jury bias. </em>The defendant claims that the record shows a substantial risk that the jurors were influenced by community bias or pretrial publicity and that the judge abused his discretion by not conducting an individual voir dire as to such influence. See G. L. c. 234, \u00a7 28. See also Mass.R.Crim.P. 20(b), 378 Mass. 889 (1979). Secondly, the defendant argues that the judge erred in failing to interview the jury panel or grant some other form of requested relief after one juror, on the second day of trial, reported that other jurors previously had read about the case in a newspaper.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">(a) Prior to the empanelment of the jury the defendant moved for an individual voir dire and proposed specific questions to be asked the prospective jurors. The judge declined to conduct an individual voir dire, but requested that defense counsel point out which questions he felt were \u201cessential\u201d to a fair trial. Then, calling for affirmative responses to be indicated by a show of hands, the judge conducted an inquiry of the venire which included the following questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>\u201cWhether you have expressed any opinion on [the case] or formed any opinion insofar as the matter is concerned . . . ;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-5\">\u201cWhether any of you are sensible of any bias or prejudice insofar as this case is concerned, the parties and the issues;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-6\">\u201cWhether any of you know of any reason why you cannot or do not stand indifferent. By standing indifferent, I mean you know of any reason why you could not . . . make your decision on the basis of the evidence that you hear and the instructions that would be given to you insofar as the law is concerned;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-7\">\u201c[H]ave any of you had any business dealings with Duddie Ford;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-8\">\u201c[W]hether any of you have purchased or shopped for a motor vehicle at the Duddie Ford dealership . . . [T]hose of you who said that you shopped down there, did any of the activities or business relations with Duddie Ford or its salesmen or other employees, result in some unfavorable impression on your part . . . ;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-9\">\u201c[W]hether any of you have read or listened to advertisements of Duddie Ford .... I think it is likely that a good number of us have at least seen the ads. But I am talking about paying sufficient attention to those ads so that you would read them . . . or . . . hear what was being said on those ads;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-10\">\u201c[W]ith all of the information that I have given you here, is there anything that comes to your mind because of what I have told you here or because of the questions that I have asked you, that you feel that you should bring to my attention before we proceed with the em-panelment of the case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b457-11\">The judge then said he would see the prospective jurors who had had any \u201cunfavorable result\u201d from business dealings with the defendant, prospective jurors who had answered affirmatively any of his questions, and anyone \u201cwho has some<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>thing to tell me that I haven\u2019t asked specifically, but you feel you should talk . . . with me before we proceed with the empanelment.\u201d After a sidebar conference requested by Duddie Ford\u2019s counsel, the judge asked for a show of hands of those jurors \u201caware of or familiar with\u201d the Duddie Ford dealership, followed by a request for a show of hands of those who were not aware of or familiar with the defendant.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> ****6</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">Some confusion then ensued. The judge excused the panel for lunch, except for \u201cthose jurors who raised their hands up here . . . [and] [t]hose who want to talk with me or whom I have asked to talk with me.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The judge questioned individually those prospective jurors \u2014 twenty-five \u2014 who remained, and excused fourteen of them, many on the basis of their previous business dealings with Duddie Ford or their unfavorable opinion of the dealership. He denied Duddie Ford\u2019s motion for a change of venue and its renewed request for an individual voir dire, stating that \u201cwhen you take the nature of the questions that I have asked them, I gave them plenty of opportunity to come up to say what they knew, how they felt, or what it is that gave them a bad taste in their mouth, or some such thing as that.\u201d He also observed that he felt he had gone \u201cto great pains in putting questions to [the prospective jurors] that would invite an opportunity for them to voice in a case that they heard was going to go for two weeks, some reason that would disqualify them as disinterested jurors.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">The next day, prior to opening statements of counsel, two of the empanelled jurors came forward in response to the judge\u2019s questions of the previous day about knowing the parties or witnesses. The judge questioned these jurors individu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>ally; one of them was challenged. In order to augment the jury, a second venire was brought in, and the judge repeated essentially the same questioning procedure that he had used with the first venire. This time all the prospective jurors indicated that they had heard of Duddie Ford. The judge questioned and excused three of the prospective jurors. Duddie Ford\u2019s request for a more extensive individual voir dire was again denied. Three more jurors were then empanelled, none of whom had been questioned individually about possible bias. Duddie Ford exhausted its peremptory challenges, as it had with respect to the first venire.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">The key inquiry is whether, as Duddie Ford contends, the prospective jurors\u2019 responses to the group questions established that there was a substantial risk that juror impartiality was affected by extraneous influences, thereby necessitating a full individual examination. G. L. c. 234, \u00a7 28. Unless the trial judge first determines that such a risk exists, individual questioning of the prospective jurors is not required; the threshold determination is subject to the judge\u2019s broad discretion. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Shelley, </em>381 Mass. 340, 352 (1980); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hobbs, </em>385 Mass. 863, 873 (1982); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sheline, </em>391 Mass. 279, 290-291 (1984); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>De La Cruz, </em>405 Mass. 269, 273-274 (1989); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mahoney, </em>406 Mass. 843, 851 (1990); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kendrick, </em>26 Mass. App. Ct. 48 (1988), <em>S.C., </em>404 Mass. 298, 303 (1989). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>386 Mass. 17, 30 (1983). Here, the judge concluded that there was not such a risk. Although the voir dire could have been conducted more smoothly, we do not think the judge abused his discretion in refusing to question all of the prospective jurors individually.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">Despite the fact that Duddie Ford was a well known enterprise in Worcester County, the judge could rightly determine that individual questioning of every prospective juror was not necessary. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kendrick, </em>404 Mass. at 303-304. Indeed, many of the prospective jurors indicated that they had heard of Duddie Ford, and the judge could properly take their failure to come forward for individual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>questioning, after his initial specific questions to them, as a representation that they could sit impartially. \u201cThe judge was entitled to \u2018accept, without more, the declaration of the jurors as to their disinterest and freedom from emotional and intellectual commitment.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ibid. </em>(citations omitted). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ascolillo, </em>405 Mass. 456, 460 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">The mere fact that many of the prospective jurors had heard of or read about Duddie Ford is insufficient in itself to show a substantial risk of prejudice. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>391 Mass. 749, 755-756 (1984). \u201cJurors need not be absolutely ignorant of the facts and issues involved in a case to be able to make an impartial judgment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 755, citing <em>Dobbert </em>v. <em>Florida, </em>432 U.S. 282, 302-303 (1977). The thrust of all the questions the judge did ask of the prospective jurors collectively was designed to flush out any juror who could not be impartial, and after questioning the ve-nire as a group about any bias, interest or other influence upon the prospective jurors\u2019 impartiality, the judge individually questioned anyone who came forward. In the circumstances, there was no abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">(b) The defendant also argues that the judge committed reversible error by not interviewing the jury panel or granting some other form of relief after one juror reported that other jurors had read about the case in newspapers. On the second day of trial, one juror came forward to say she had seen a program on television about the case, and that now \u201cit all came back to me.\u201d The juror also stated that she had asked the other jurors about it and that none of the other jurors had seen anything on television, but \u201cthey [had] read things in the paper, you know, previously.\u201d Duddie Ford\u2019s motions for a mistrial and a change of venue were denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-7\">If the trial judge determines that a serious question of possible prejudice has arisen because members of an empanelled jury have been exposed to potentially extraneous material about the case during the trial, a voir dire examination of the jurors should be conducted. \u201cThe initial questioning . . . may be carried on collectively, but if any juror indicates that he or she has seen or heard the [potentially prejudicial] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>material, there must be individual questioning of that juror. . . .\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>376 Mass. 790, 800 (1978). The judge in this situation must again make a threshold determination whether there has been raised \u201ca serious question of possible prejudice.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>In claims involving pretrial publicity the \u201c \u2018dominant consideration ... is not the views to which the jurors have been exposed; it is what is their commitment, if any, in their own opinions, or their own expressions.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>391 Mass. at 755-756, quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Subilosky, </em>352 Mass. 153, 158-159 (1967). Here, the judge concluded that the pretrial publicity would not affect the jurors if they said it would not when originally questioned by him. In effect, the judge concluded that he had already sufficiently questioned the jurors as to their impartiality, in general terms, and that there was no further need to question them specifically about pretrial publicity.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">Moreover, it may have been the better decision that the judge did not inquire whether the jurors had seen or heard anything about the Duddie Ford case in the media. \u201cSuch specific inquires could well have created a problem where there was none.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kendrick, </em>404 Mass. at 304, and cases cited.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The judge had instructed the jury, after they were empanelled, to avoid talking and reading about the case. He excused the one juror who came forward to say that she had seen a television program and felt that it might affect her impartiality. He saw no reason to inquire further as to whether the other jurors had been exposed to outside information about the case. The juror who came forward stated that the other jurors had read about Duddie Ford prior to, and not during, the trial. \u201cThere is no indication in the totality of the circumstances that the defendant was de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>nied a fair trial because of pretrial publicity.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>391 Mass. at 756.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">2. <em>Evidentiary matters. </em>The defendant\u2019s second claim of error is that highly prejudicial documentary materials were improperly admitted in evidence. Specifically, Duddie Ford argues that it was reversible error to admit the customers\u2019 loan applications and income verification documents because they had not been properly authenticated. Citing <em>Irwin </em>v. <em>Ware, </em>392 Mass. 745, 749-751 (1984), the defendant contends that the documents had to be introduced by someone who had personal knowledge of their creation and could establish their chain of custody; because that was not done, the documents were \u201cinadmissible on materiality or relevance grounds.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 750.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">The documents were introduced through the testimony of the bank\u2019s vice president, Wayne Cady, who was designated for the purposes of the trial as the keeper of the records. The defendant objected to their admission, claiming that the business records statute, G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 78, was not applicable to the documents because (a) they were not being admitted for their truth, and (b) the requirements of the statute were not satisfied.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The defendant further argues that the statute does not provide an independent method of authentication when records are not offered for the truth of what they recite and that Cady could not otherwise authenticate them. See Liacos, Massachusetts Evidence 375-377 (5th ed. 1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b462-7\">The judge made a finding that the loan applications and income verification documents qualified as business records, but because of what he perceived as a \u201ctotem pole hearsay\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>problem<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> ruled that they could be admitted \u201cfor the limited purpose of showing what [was] on file at the Coolidge Bank &amp; Trust Company\u201d and \u201cwhat the [documents] recite [d] . . . not for the truth or falsity of what [was] in [them].\u201d Therefore, even if the documents were not technically within the business records exception and could not be admitted for the truth of the facts they contained, the issue presented here is whether the documents were sufficiently authenticated to be admissible for the limited purpose of showing what they recited and what was on file at the bank at the time the loans in question were approved.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">Generally, for documents (including business records) to be admissible, regardless of the purpose for which they are being offered, they must be identified, shown to be relevant, and authenticated by a witness who is familiar with them. Here, the manner of authentication was sufficient to provide the necessary indicia of genuineness. Taken as a whole, the sworn testimony of Cady, an officer of the bank, was sufficient to authenticate the documents. He produced the original files, stated that they came from the bank, and testified that such documents were factors generally used in the banking industry to establish the ability of borrowers to repay loans. See <em>Kaufman </em>v. <em>Kaitz, </em>325 Mass 149, 151 (1949). He also was the keeper of the records, or was at least authorized to appear on the custodian\u2019s behalf. Thus, the documents were sufficiently authenticated to be admitted to show what was on record at the bank.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">3. <em>Duplicitous convictions. </em>Duddie Ford contends that its convictions and sentences under G. L. c. 266, \u00a7 34, must be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>vacated and the indictments dismissed because the convictions under G. L. c. 266, \u00a7 34, and G. L. c. 266, \u00a7 33(2), are duplicitous.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> It argues that \u00a7 34 does not require proof of an additional fact not required by \u00a7 33(2), and that any conduct that violates \u00a7 33(2) is necessarily encompassed within the elements of \u00a7 34 as well. In essence, the argument is that a \u00a7 34 violation is a lesser-included offense of \u00a7 33(2), although the punishment for violation of either is the same. See <em>Kuklis </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>361 Mass. 302, 306-307 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">On its face, \u00a7 33(2) demonstrates the necessity, to support a conviction, of proof of several facts that are not required for conviction under \u00a7 34. The dispositive issue thus becomes whether a conviction under \u00a7 34 \u201crequires proof of an additional fact which [\u00a7 33(2)] does not.\u201d <em>Morey </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>108 Mass. 433, 434 (1871). The Commonwealth relies upon <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Greenberg, </em>339 Mass. 557 (1959), wherein the defendants were found guilty of numerous counts of larceny of money from a bank by false pretenses under G. L. c. 266, \u00a7 30,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and of numerous counts, under G. L. c. 266, \u00a7 33, of obtaining credit with intent to defraud by false statements in writing respecting their means and ability to pay. The convictions were based upon the same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>series of transactions with the same two banks. 339 Mass. at 561-562. At the close of the evidence the defendants had moved that the Commonwealth be required to proceed under the indictments under one section or the other but not both. After setting forth the relevant statutory provisions, the court concluded that \u201csections [30 and 33(2)] declare distinct offenses although classified as larcenies. In one it is the theft of property as defined in the statute which is penalized; in the other the fraudulent obtaining of credit.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 572. Thus, under <em>Greenberg, </em>convictions of larceny of money by false pretenses from a bank and the fraudulent obt\u00e1ining of credit from the same bank are not duplicitous.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">In the present case the Commonwealth did not indict and try the defendant on the larceny of property charge under \u00a7 30 but proceeded under \u00a7 34. The Commonwealth argues that \u00a7 34 requires proof that the defendant by false pretenses effectuated the parting of the owner from his \u201cproperty\", while section 33(2) does not.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The defendant argues that the reference within \u00a7 34 to prohibited conduct respecting \u201cany of the benefits described in the preceding section [33]\u201d requires the conclusion that convictions under both sections would not satisfy the <em>Morey </em>test. It is true that a defendant can be convicted of larceny of property (money) of a bank by false pretenses in addition to the fraudulent obtaining of credit as a result of the same conduct. But the appropriate statute is not G. L. c. 266, \u00a7 34,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> for if a defendant can be convicted, under \u00a7 34, of larceny for inducing another to part with \u201cany of the benefits described in\u201d \u00a7 33, there is no addi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>tional element necessary for a conviction under \u00a7 34 not required by \u00a7 33.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Consequently, the distinction between the fraudulent obtaining of credit and the fraudulent obtaining of property by false pretenses can be drawn, if at all, by G. L. c. 266, \u00a7 30, not G. L. c. 266, \u00a7 34. Unlike \u00a7 34, \u00a7 30 contains no reference to \u00a7 33 in defining the res necessary for the crime of larceny. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Greenberg, </em>339 Mass. at 572. In the instant circumstances the indictments for larceny of property by false pretenses should not have been laid under \u00a7 34, if the Commonwealth wished to bring the convictions within the purview of the <em>Greenberg </em>case. As we have concluded that the convictions under G. L. c. 266, \u00a7 34, are duplicitous, the sentences imposed thereon must be vacated, and those indictments are to be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">Deciding as we do, it is unnecessary to reach Duddie Ford\u2019s other argument that even if its convictions under \u00a7 33(2) and. \u00a7 34 are not duplicitous, in order to be convicted under \u00a7 34, the Commonwealth must establish that the false pretense was \u201cin writing and . . . signed by the [party] to be charged.\u201d G. L. c. 266, \u00a7 35.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> See in this regard, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stovall, </em>22 Mass. App. Ct. 737, 742 (1986). Nor do we need to discuss the defendant\u2019s contention that the judge\u2019s instructions authorized convictions under \u00a7 34 without requiring proof of any fact that was not also essential to the convictions under \u00a7 33(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">4. <em>Jury instructions. </em>Duddie Ford\u2019s next argument is that G. L. c. 266, \u00a7 33(2), expressly requires proof of a false statement in writing and that the judge in his instructions omitted the requirement from his definition of the essential elements of \u00a7 33(2), thereby precluding the jury from mak<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>ing the constitutionally required finding of the existence of every element of the crime. Citing <em>In re Winship, </em>397 U.S. 358 (1970), the defendant asserts that the error was so prejudicial that the judgments under \u00a7 33(2) must be reversed. The defendant\u2019s argument is off the mark.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">Immediately before listing the elements of \u00a7 33(2), the judge instructed the jury that the crime required \u201can instrument in writing tending to establish the trustworthiness of a person that was false.\u201d The judge did not, however, include that requirement when he stated \u201cthe essential elements\u201d of the crime. The instructions were not constitutionally deficient. Viewing the charge as a whole,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> we conclude that the judge clearly and correctly imparted that a conviction under G. L. c. 266, \u00a7 33(2), required the fraudulent obtaining of credit \u201cby a false statement in writing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">5. <em>Evidence of false statement in writing. </em>Duddie Ford also argues that on two of the indictments under c. 266, \u00a7 33(2), the Commonwealth introduced no evidence of a false statement in writing, and that, on three other indictments under the same provision of the statute, the customers gave no testimony regarding the source of the loan documents. The Commonwealth asserts that it showed Duddie Ford \u201ccaused\u201d false information to be included in the customers\u2019 loan application forms which were reduced to writing by bank employees based upon information supplied to them by the defendant, and that that is sufficient to satisfy the false statement in writing requirement of \u00a7 33(2). We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>The express language of \u00a7 33(2) does not require proof that the defendant prepared the false statement in writing, but only that credit was obtained <em>\u201cby </em>a false statement in writing\u201d (emphasis supplied). Evidence that Duddie Ford caused false statements to be included in the customers\u2019 written loan applications was sufficient proof of that essential element of the crime. On all of the indictments under \u00a7 33(2), the necessary proof that the documents contained false information was supplied by the live testimony of the customers themselves, all of whom testified that the written documents contained false information, either with respect to the amount of their income or the purchase price of the car, or both. We think that the information contained in the false income verification documents or loan applications of all the customers save one (John Gerard), whether they were prepared by the bank, by Duddie Ford, or by the customers at Nedder\u2019s direction, provided a legally sufficient basis for the jury reasonably to infer that the defendant provided or caused to be filed false statements in writing within the meaning of ,\u00a7 33(2). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sandler, </em>368 Mass. 729, 740 (1975). As to John Gerard, the Commonwealth failed to introduce any evidence that Duddie Ford was the source of the false statements, and the judgments regarding the defendant\u2019s involvement with that customer must be vacated and the indictments dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">; 6. <em>Sufficiency of the evidence. </em>The defendant argues that its motions for required findings of not guilty should have been allowed because the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence was legally and factually insufficient to support the convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">(a) First, Duddie Ford asserts that there was no proof that the bank actually relied upon the false statements. It argues that the only evidence introduced was Wayne Cady\u2019s testimony on \u201cthe banking industry practice and custom in relation to the granting of consumer loans,\u201d and that that testimony was insufficient to show reliance by the bank. Duddie Ford stresses Cady\u2019s lack of personal knowledge of the so-called \u201cDial-a-Loan\u201d program, and the irregularity of the documents contained in the loan files.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>For a conviction of larceny by false pretenses to stand, the false statements \u201c \u2018need not be the sole or predominating motive that induced the victim to part with his money or property ...[;] it is enough if [the statements] alone or with other causes materially influenced him to take the particular action. . . .\u2019\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Edgerly, </em>6 Mass App. Ct. 241, 263 (1978), quoting from <em>National Shawmut Bank </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>317 Mass. 485, 490 (1945). Cady, as an officer of the bank, testified that banks customarily rely on information in loan applications in granting loans. Furthermore, common sense dictates, and the jury reasonably could infer from the evidence presented, that the bank relied on the statements contained in the files in deciding whether to grant the loans. The jury properly could conclude that false statements made to the bank and false documents that were submitted \u201cmaterially influenced\u201d the bank to extend credit to the customers. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Edgerly, </em>6 Mass. App. Ct. at 263, and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">(b) Duddie Ford next argues that there is no proof that Nedder acted for the benefit of the corporation and that, consequently, it cannot be held criminally liable for his actions. It makes the additional claim that because Nedder concealed his actions from Duddie Ford there was no evidence from which a rational jury could have concluded that Nedder was motivated by anything other than self-interest. The record indicates otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">\u201c[Corporate criminal liability is necessarily vicarious.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Beneficial Fin. Co., </em>360 Mass. 188, 263-264 (1971), cert. denied sub nom. <em>Farrell </em>v. <em>Massachusetts, </em>407 U.S. 910, and sub. nom. <em>Beneficial Fin.

Criminal liability is imposed upon a corporate defendant if \u201ccriminal conduct [is] performed for its benefit, by its agent authorized to act for the corporation in relation to the particular sphere of corporate business in which the agent was engaged when the criminal conduct took place.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>L. A. L. Corp., </em>400 Mass. 737, 744 (1987). The focus is \u201con the authority of the corporate agent in relation to the <em>particular </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>corporate business in which the agent was engaged\u201d <em>(Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Beneficial Fin.

The judgments on the remaining indictments brought under G. L. c. 266, \u00a7 33, are affirmed. The judgments on the indictments brought under G.
