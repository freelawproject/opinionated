By motion for a required finding at the close of the Commonwealth\u2019s case, the defendant challenged the sufficiency of the evidence to support the judgment of conviction of mayhem. The trial judge denied the motion, ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>plaining his ruling in a memorandum. He also denied a postverdict motion for a required finding or for a new trial. We agree in substance with the judge\u2019s view, and we affirm the judgment and the denial of a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">1. In the evening of Saturday, January 24, 1987, Roger and his wife Janice brought to the emergency room of the Berkshire Medical Center their daughter Laura, then two and a half years old. The child was very ill and immediately engaged the anxious attention of the doctors. Upon superficial inspection, the child was seen to be deeply comatose; motionless, except as her left arm and leg jerked spontaneously; covered over her body with bruises of various shades and sizes; and exhibiting fractures of the skull and two long bones. The doctors were immediately suspicious of the parents\u2019 story that the injuries were caused by the child\u2019s fall from a \u201cpotty\u201d seat.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">Dr. Edward Galla, the emergency physician, evidently acted to initiate a dispatch call which summoned to the Center a \u201cprotective investigator\u201d of the Department of Social Services, Michael Harrigan. We shall outline here the interviews conducted by Harrigan and subsequently by the State police which led to Roger\u2019s arrest and formed part of the Commonwealth\u2019s case at trial. We reserve to our point 2 details of the nature and permanence of the child\u2019s injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"AZH\">Harrigan viewed Laura and then asked the parents (who had already spoken to the doctors) how the casualty occurred. Janice answered: In the early afternoon of that day, January 24, she was tending her two boys (aged sixteen months and a few months) in a room of the trailer in which the family lived. She heard a thud in the bathroom nearby and, rushing there, found Laura had fallen from a \u201cpotty\u201d seat and was lying unconscious on the floor. Janice carried Laura outside, calling for Roger. The two tried to revive the child by applying snow to her face. It did not help. They brought the child back into the trailer. She was not breathing but began to flail her arms. Janice and Roger alternately held Laura\u2019s arms while the other attempted mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. Roger told Harrigan that, to open <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>Laura\u2019s closed mouth for this purpose, he used a child\u2019s spoon and in the process broke one tooth and bent another; for fear that Laura would swallow the teeth, Roger said he removed them.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> He said \u201che would try anything.\u201d Frightened that Laura would not waken, he struck her on her face and chest. According to Janice, perhaps forty-five minutes after the fall Laura began to cry. Piling the three children and Janice into the family car, Roger drove from the trailer location in Plainfield to the Medical Center in Pittsfield. Such was the parents\u2019 account attributing the major damage to the fall.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">On Monday, January 26 \u2014 by which time the doctors had more fully analyzed Laura\u2019s severe injuries \u2014 State trooper Robert Scott, assisting the district attorney, questioned Roger at the Center. Roger told much the same story Janice and he had told Harrigan, but added some features.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Upon the trooper\u2019s question whether anyone else was present when he was outside the trailer, Roger paused, then said, \u201cI think Dave \u2014 I don\u2019t know his last name.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> After another pause, Roger asked whether the trooper would talk with Dave. Told that \u201ceveryone up there\u201d would be interviewed, Roger said, \u201cGoddam it, you\u2019re going to find out anyway. This didn\u2019t happen on Saturday, it really happened on Friday. Everything else I told you is the truth. Laura was hurt by falling <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>off the potty seat.\u201d Asked why he had lied about the date, Roger said, \u201cWe knew what people would think.\u201d He said he knew Laura had a serious head injury because, when he shined light in her eyes, one eye did not respond. He said he didn\u2019t believe an ambulance could get through; the snow was very deep.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">That night, January 26, Trooper Scott with two other officers went to the trailer and conducted a search with the consent of Janice and Roger. They viewed the potty seat. In conversation thereafter, Roger said the sixteen month old boy, Anthony (then weighing twenty-five pounds), \u201cwas mean to Laura\u201d; perhaps he pushed or struck Laura and caused a bump on the back of her head; the bump \u201cmight have bled into her head\u201d and caused Laura to faint and fall off the potty seat.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> When Trooper Scott asked how Laura came to suffer a fracture of her skull behind her left ear, Roger said he didn\u2019t think jail was the right place for women. Then he said, \u201cHypothetically, just hypothetically, what would happen to us if we put her up against the wall and we took turns on her?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">Trooper Scott placed Roger under arrest the following evening, January 27. At police barracks that night, Roger spoke about three previous fractures suffered by Laura. He had been left alone with her when she was fifteen days old. She began crying and would not stop. Frustrated, Roger \u201cstruck Laura in the head with his fingertips.\u201d It was with \u201crather great force,\u201d judging from Roger\u2019s reenactment of the blows, and from the fact itself that the skull was fractured. This show of what could be taken as Roger\u2019s hostility or malice toward Laura was matched by testimony indicating similar <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>hostility on Janice\u2019s part.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> There was, according to Roger, a second skull fracture around that time when Janice was bathing Laura, and Laura slipped and struck her forehead on the faucet of the bathtub. Again, Roger, startled while sitting in a rocking chair with Laura, to prevent her falling from his lap to the ground, grabbed her leg \u201crather violently\u201d and thus fractured it.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">Another officer, Gerard Gagne, who participated in Roger\u2019s arrest, interviewing Roger, asked whether it was not true that Laura was injured before the fall \u2014 that the injury made her dizzy and lose consciousness and therefore she fell. Roger \u201cindicated to me [Gagne] with an up and down nod of his head ... he acknowledged what I had asked him.\u201d Gagne asked Roger when (specifically) Laura was hurt. Roger said, \u201c T can\u2019t tell you that .... I\u2019ve got a few aces, I\u2019ve got a trump card up my sleeve,\u2019 or something to that effect.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">2. We are able to say that the gross injuries to Laura occurred in the interval from January 8 to January 23, 1987,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> when, according to testimony, Roger and Janice in their isolated spot had exclusive, or nearly exclusive, access to Laura; and very likely the injuries mainly occurred in fact on January 23, as Roger said. It was on January 8 that Jayne Marsh-Babij, a social worker for the Department of Social Services, having observed the previous day a cut on Laura\u2019s face and black and blue marks on both cheeks and across the forehead, brought the child and Janice to Dr. Charles Drummer, a family practitioner at the Worthington Health <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>Center. Dr. Brummer did a routine examination of Laura\u2019s head and neck and a neurologic examination. He did not quarrel with Janice\u2019s statement that the marks on Laura\u2019s face resulted from a fall on January 6 as she climbed the stairs to the trailer; apparently he saw no recent gross injuries; he testified, however, that he found Laura \u201cdevelopmentally delayed\u201d with low verbal ability.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">Four physicians, Dr. Edward Galla, Dr. Gerald Zupruk, a neurosurgeon, Dr. Joel Curran, a pediatrician, and Dr. John Gault, an ophthalmologist, treated Laura on January 24-26. They found reason to disbelieve the parents\u2019 story linking the injuries to a minor fall. The individual findings, to which they testified, may be taken together and much abbreviated and outlined thus.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">There were multiple bruises, contusions, and abrasions across Laura\u2019s whole body; from the varying colors of the bruises, mostly to her head, arms, legs, and back, these injuries could be assessed to range in age from several days past to within twelve to twenty-four hours.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-7\">Laura had sustained fractures of the skull to the left side, of the right arm, and of the right collarbone, the first two fractures being recent and simultaneous, the third incurred somewhat earlier. The skull fracture was such as would be caused by strong trauma to the head, comparable to that which would result from a fall from a considerable height. This impact to the head had caused swelling and bleeding within the brain, which, implicating particularly the tissue on the left side, threatened impairment of the child\u2019s ability to move the right side of her body as well as impairment of her speech.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> There also were retinal hemorrhages caused by severe force to the head.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-8\">The pediatrician summed up the evidence in a medical diagnosis of \u201cbattered child syndrome\u201d consisting of the six classic elements: child under three years of age; bone injuries at different times; subdural hematomas (here with skull fracture); history given which does not fit the observed injuries; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>soft tissue injury; evidence of neglect. This syndrome tends to exclude the likelihood that the injuries occurred by accident.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> (The diagnosis was confirmed by testimony of Dr. Brian Blackbourne, a forensic pathologist, based on his reading and analysis of the medical records.)</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">As to factors bearing on the permanence of Laura\u2019s injuries, we summarize first the testimony of Dr. Edward Hart, a pediatric neurologist, who treated Laura at the Kennedy Memorial Hospital from March 5 to September 10, 1987. The child suffered, he found, from recurrent otitis media (ear infections); retinal hemorrhage (bleeding into the back of the eye); aphasia (loss of language from time to time); right hemiparesis (weakness and stiffness in right arm and leg); visual field defect, due to loss by atrophy or shrinkage of tissue in the back part of the brain. The testimony of Dr. Edward L. Kazarian, an ophthalmologist, who examined Laura in February, 1988, about a year after the event, confirmed a prognosis by Dr. Hart of the permanence of the damage to Laura\u2019s eyesight: the optic nerves had been impaired and would not regenerate; there was loss of peripheral vision on the right side of each eye.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">Two witnesses testified t\u00f3 Laura\u2019s inability to function normally to the time of trial: Jean Ashlaw, a registered occupational therapist with a pediatric specialty, and Ellen Courtney, an early-childhood special needs teacher. Laura had difficulty opening her right hand and extending her right arm; thus she could not readily manipulate objects with her right hand, and that hand tightened and came up to her chest automatically when she ran; she had trouble bearing weight and even in putting on a shoe. Her right arm in fact was almost always in a bent condition. Her defective eyesight caused Laura to misjudge spaces so that she made mistakes in trying to get through doorways.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>3. \u201cThe mental state required for conviction of mayhem or assault with intent to maim is satisfied by direct or inferential proof that the assault was intentional, unjustified, and made with the reasonable appreciation on the assailant\u2019s part that a disabling or disfiguring injury would result.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>10 Mass. App. Ct. 190, 196 (1980). And see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Farrell, </em>322 Mass. 606, 619 (1948); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hogan, </em>7 Mass. App. Ct. 236, 244, <em>S.C., </em>379 Mass. 190 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">Here, as shown at length at point 2, there is plain, in fact indisputable, proof of disabling and disfiguring injuries which will oppress the victim for the rest of her life.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">The jury could readily accept the diagnosis of \u201cbattered child syndrome\u201d and its intrinsic meaning, namely, that the injuries came about, in all probability, by conscious (intentional) acts. And Roger, and Janice as well, were physically located continuously so as to be available to commit these acts; on the record, responsibility cannot fairly be cast on anyone else.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-7\">As the <em>Davis </em>and other cases teach, the substance of the requisite mental state for mayhem is that the actor shall be aware that what he or she is doing will eventuate in grievous damage of the victim (an element of willingness that this should happen naturally accompanies the awareness). In most if not all mayhem prosecutions, this mental condition is established inferentially, rather than directly; and so here.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-8\">The jury could infer from the episode of the first skull fracture by Roger, and from Bolduc\u2019s account of Janice\u2019s punishment of Laura in the trailer (see note 7, <em>supra), </em>that the parents were hostile toward this child. Next comes Roger\u2019s agreement with Gagne\u2019s suggestion that Laura was struck before any fall from the potty, and this the jury might well connect with Roger\u2019s \u201chypothetical,\u201d which presents the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>picture of the parents taking turns in the beating. The jury could then assess the cruelty or callous indifference evinced by their waiting a day after the child\u2019s near death before bringing her to the hospital. From the abusive treatment of Laura over time and the severity of the final injuries, as found and described by the physicians, comes a particularly strong inference about the state of mind of anyone responsible. Compare the many instances where the nature of the injuries has entered into an appraisal of the animus with which they were inflicted: <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Farrell, </em>322 Mass. at 618-619; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tucceri, 9 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 844, 845 (1980); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hamm, </em>19 Mass. App. Ct. 72, 80 (1984); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mercado, </em>24 Mass. App. Ct. 391, 395 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">Evidence of consciousness of guilt could not itself justify a conviction, but a jury might take it as reinforcing other evidence of guilt. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mercado, </em>24 Mass. App. Ct. at 400. Here we have the parents\u2019 falsehood, admitted by Roger when he saw there was no escape, about the day when Laura collapsed; also Roger\u2019s pitifully thin statement of little Anthony\u2019s supposed attacks on Laura as an explanation of her subdural bleeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">Counsel for Roger suggests that his conviction cannot stand because, if it be granted on the present record that someone could be found guilty of the crime, that someone could as well be Janice as Roger. We say, as in a similar situation in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mercado, </em>24 Mass. App. Ct. at 395-396, that there is enough to establish the \u201cindividual guilt\u201d of Roger, but in any case \u201cit requires but a small shift of emphasis to find guilt ... on a basis of joint venture\u201d between Roger and Janice, a matter on which the jury were duly instructed in accordance with the authorities. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Richards, </em>363 Mass. 299, 308 (1973); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Soares, </em>377 Mass. 461, 470 (1979); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fidler, </em>23 Mass. App. Ct. 506, 513 (1987). (And see the statutory text, note 12 above.) It matters not that it may have been Janice rather than Roger who struck the child at some climactic moment. The jury could find that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>the parents were mutually supportive in their inhumane attitude toward the child and in abusing her physically and that they shared the mindset intrinsic to the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">The evidence rose well above the level required to repel a motion for a required finding: the question on such a motion is \u201cwhether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, <em>any </em>rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Berry </em>v. Commonwealth, 393 Mass. 793, 794 (1985) (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b184-7\">\n<em>Order denying motion for new trial affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b175-15\">The defendant was also indicted for assault with a dangerous weapon, but this was nol pressed before trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-16\">The wife Janice was indicted for the same crimes as the defendant, but her case was severed and does not figure on this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b177-6\">Roger brought the spoon and the teeth to the Center.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b177-7\">Roger said he told Janice to fetch a neighbor who was an EMT (if so, there was no follow-up); in trying to waken Laura he had held her by the torso and shaken her but that \u201cdidn\u2019t look like such a good idea\u201d and \u201cher head was going back and forth awfully hard\u201d; he had slapped her across the left side of her face and yelled while Janice banged with a spoon on a pan near the child\u2019s ear. He had extracted the teeth with tweezers.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b177-9\">David Brinck vacationed 'in the largely empty trailer park at times in the winter. He testified that in the afternoon of January 23 he heard a yell from the direction of Roger\u2019s trailer and saw Janice hand Roger what looked like a child \u2014 \u201c[i]t looked kind of limp.\u201d That evening Brinck asked Roger, shovelling snow, if everything was all right. Roger said no, but \u201che\u2019d rather not discuss it.\u201d Next day, Roger asked Brinck to help jumpstart Roger\u2019s car, which Brinck did. Brinck entered Roger\u2019s trailer, saw a woman and two small children, and heard another child \u2014 it was a \u201ckind of gargling ... or a muffled sound\u201d from \u201c[o]ne of the other rooms.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b178-7\">According to the testimony of Raymond Bolduc, owner of the trailer camp, there were telephones within relatively short distances from the Lazareviches\u2019 trailer.
