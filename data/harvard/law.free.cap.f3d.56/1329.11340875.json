Pursuant to \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(5), Justice initially was assigned a base offense level of 18, because his \u201coffense involved a firearm listed in 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5845(a);\u201d more specifically, his offense involved grenades which are destructive devices, one of the several types of firearms listed in \u00a7 5845(a). <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(5) &amp; comment, (n. 5); 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5845. Because grenades also fall into the special firearms category of \u201cdestructive devices,\u201d pursuant to \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(3) Justice\u2019s base offense level was enhanced another two points, resulting in a base offense level of 20. Justice contends that the combined application of \u00a7\u00a7 2K2.1(a)(5) and 2K2.1(b)(3) constitutes impermissible double counting of his offense conduct. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1416-10\">The commentary accompanying \u00a7 2K2.1 directs a sentencing judge to apply both subsections (a)(5) and (b)(3) when calculating the sentence of a defendant whose offense involved a destructive device. Application Note 11 explains:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1416-11\">A defendant whose offense involves a destructive device receives both the base offense level from the subsection applicable to a firearm listed in 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5845(a) <em>(e.g., </em>subsection ... (a)(3) ...), and a two-level enhancement under subsection (b)(3). Such devices pose a considerably greater risk to the public welfare than other National Firearms Act weapons.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1416-14\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1, comment, (n. 11). The \u201ccommentary in the Guidelines Manual that interprets or explains a guideline is authoritative unless it violates the Constitution or a federal statute, or is inconsistent with, or a plainly erroneous reading of, <em>that guideline.\u201d Stinson v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, -, 113 S.Ct. 1913, 1915, 123 L.Ed.2d 598 (1993) (emphasis added). Justice does not argue that Note 11 violates the Constitution or a federal statute. Nor does he contest the fact that Note 11 clearly comports with the plain language of \u00a7 2K2.1. Instead, he contends that Note 11 conflicts with <em>other </em>guidelines and their commentary which restrict double counting. Thus, Justice fails to address what is the critical question under <em>Stinson: </em>whether a guideline\u2019s commentary contradicts <em>that </em>guideline. Having conducted our own review of the relevant guideline and commentary, we conclude that Note 11 is not \u201c \u2018plainly erroneous or inconsistent with\u2019 \u201d \u00a7 2K2.1. Accordingly, the application note controls our determination of this case, <em>see Stinson, </em>\u2014 U.S. at -, 113 S.Ct. at 1920, and we reject Justice\u2019s contention.</p>\n<p id=\"AIn\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
