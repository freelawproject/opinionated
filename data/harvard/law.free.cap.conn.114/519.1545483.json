In support of the motion, the defendant procured the certification of certain portions of the evidence. The motion was denied by the commissioner, and upon appeal, by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-8\">The obvious purpose of the motion was to lay a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>basis, if possible, for a conclusion that it was the duty of the decedent to take the route by Oak Street and Legion Avenue and that he took the route he did for some purpose of his own, and so unnecessarily subjected himself to grave risk, and was not then in a place where he had a right to be and therefore the drowning could not be said to have arisen out of or in course of the employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">This evidence does not justify the addition of any subordinate facts which would support the conclusions desired. They would not support a conclusion that the decedent at the time was on some errand of his own or that the route he took was \u201cobviously and necessarily dangerous\u201d or that it subjected him to \u201cextraordinary peril.\u201d Unchallenged portions of the finding show that to go to the transformer from the decedent\u2019s home, one could use either the pontoon bridge or a row boat; that there were \u201cno regular paths\u201d across the filled-in land and to reach the bridge on foot the decedent \u201cwas free to find his way across the filled-in land from the road ... by whatever way he chose\u201d and that there was a row boat in service, which at that time was tied to the bridge.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-7\">This evidence, including the photographs and the sketch referred to therein, makes it clear that the decedent, instead of taking the longer route by way of Oak Street and Legion Avenue, \u201ccut across lots\u201d from Oak Street and skirted the end of the lagoon, and for some unknown reason, got into the water and was drowned. There is no suggestion that he crossed the lot for any private purpose of his own, but on the contrary it is clear that he was on his way to work, equipped therefor and on time. He took a route which was shorter than that which the defendant contends he should have taken, but it is found and not contested, that he was free to do this. There were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>no defined paths for him to follow and he was, so far as appears, under no requirement by the terms of his employment, to take any particular route.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">The motion to correct the finding was properly denied. Talcing the subordinate facts as they are presented to us, we cannot say that the conclusions of the commissioner and the court drawn therefrom were not logical and reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-7\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
