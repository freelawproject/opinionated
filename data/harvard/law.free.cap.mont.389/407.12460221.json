We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-9\">\u00b62 We restate the issue on appeal as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-10\">\n<em>Whether the District Court erred in granting Teeter\u2019s motion for summary judgment under \u00a7\u00a7 33-18-201(6) and (13), MCA, concluding that no disputed issues of material fact existed regarding causation and damages.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b434-11\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b434-12\">\u00b63 This case arises from a motor vehicle accident in Missoula, Montana, on May 30, 2014. Derek Colberg (Colberg) rear-ended Plaintiff Teeter\u2019s vehicle on Brooks Street. Mid-Century insured Colberg. The officer who arrived at the scene concluded Colberg was responsible for the crash and cited him for careless driving.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-13\">\u00b64 Later that day, Teeter sought medical treatment for possible injuries from the crash. The treating physician diagnosed Teeter with whiplash and a right shoulder strain. Following her diagnosis, Teeter saw several health care professionals to treat her physical and psychological injuries including a chiropractor, neurologist, physical therapist, counselor, and masseuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-14\">\u00b65 Immediately after the accident Teeter retained counsel demanding advance payment of medical costs from Mid-Century. Mid-Century determined its insured Colberg was responsible for the accident and made several advance payments to Teeter for her medical expenses and lost wages. Mid-Century paid in advance $53,347.97 from May 30, 2014, until December 2014. In November 2014, Mid-Century sought Teeter\u2019s past medical records and asked Teeter to undergo an independent medical examination (IME) to determine if the ongoing medical expenses were related to the accident. Teeter refused both requests. In December, Mid-Century had Dr. Lennard Wilson conduct a records review of Teeter\u2019s post-accident medical records. Mid-Century discontinued Teeter\u2019s advance payments based on Dr. Wilson\u2019s opinion that Teeter\u2019s ongoing expenses were no longer causally related to the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>\u00b66 On February 17, 2015, Teeter filed a declaratory action against Mid-Century seeking payment of medical expenses and lost wages incurred after December 16, 2014. During discovery, Mid-Century obtained two IMEs of Teeter. The first IME was with forensic psychiatrist Dr. William Stratford on March 15 and 16, 2016. Dr. Stratford concluded that Teeter\u2019s symptoms were almost entirely a psychological issue. The second IME was with board-certified orthopedist Dr. Emily Heid on March 22, 2016. Dr. Heid determined that there was no physiological basis for Teeter\u2019s pain complaints.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">\u00b67 On June 23,2016, Teeter filed her motion for summary judgment arguing that there is no dispute of material facts that Colberg\u2019s liability is reasonably clear and that Teeter\u2019s medical expenses and lost wages were causally related to the accident. The following day, Mid-Century filed its own motion for summary judgment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Mid-Century argued that the opinions of Dr. Wilson, Dr. Heid, and Dr. Stratford (collectively, the Doctors) provided objective evidence establishing a reasonable debate regarding whether Teeter\u2019s ongoing medical expenses and wage losses were causally related to the accident. Further, Mid-Century maintained that a declaratory action was inappropriate since there was a clear dispute of fact that should be resolved by a jury in a tort action.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">\u00b68 On August 23,2016, the District Court held oral arguments on the cross-motions for summary judgment. On December 30, 2016, the District Court issued its sixty-nine-page Opinion and Order. The District Court determined the following: (1) a declaratory action was appropriate to resolve narrow issues of fact regarding medical causation and damages; (2) Teeter\u2019s sworn statement combined with her treating providers\u2019 affidavits made a prima facie showing that it is reasonably clear that her medical expenses and wage losses are causally related to the accident; (3) the opinions of the Doctors did not create a disputed issue of material fact as to medical causation and damages; and (4) the Doctors lacked foundation.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-7\">\u00b69 Following the District Court\u2019s Opinion and Order, Teeter petitioned for supplemental relief seeking fees and costs. Mid-Century objected to the petition. On March 23,2017, the District Court granted Teeter\u2019s petition and ordered Mid-Century to pay Teeter\u2019s unpaid medical expenses, lost wages, medically related mileage, attorney fees <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>and costs. Mid-Century appeals the District Court\u2019s order granting Teeter summary judgment and the award of fees and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">\u00b610 We review a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment de novo, applying the same criteria of M. R. Civ. P. 56 as the district court. <em>Pilgeram v. GreenPoint Mortg. Funding, Inc., </em>2013 MT 354, \u00b6 9, 373 Mont. 1, 313 P.3d 839. We review a district court\u2019s conclusions of law to determine whether they are correct and its findings of fact to determine whether they are clearly erroneous. <em>Pilgeram, </em>\u00b6 9. Under Rule 56(c), summary judgment will be granted if the moving party can show there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law. <em>Roe v. City of Missoula, </em>2009 MT 417, \u00b6 14, 354 Mont. 1, 221 P.3d 1200.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b436-8\">\u00b611 <em>Whether the District Court erred in granting Teeter\u2019s motion for summary judgment under \u00a7\u00a7 33-18-201(6) and (13), MCA, concluding that no disputed issues of material fact existed regarding causation and damages.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b436-9\">\u00b612 Mid-Century argues the District Court erred in granting summary judgment to Teeter because it was not reasonably clear that the medical expenses and wage losses were causally related to the accident. Further, Mid-Century maintains that the issues of fact as to causation and damages should be resolved by a jury in a tort action. Lastly, Mid-Century argues that the District Court erroneously disregarded the opinions of the Doctors.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-10\">\u00b613 Teeter counters that the District Court properly granted summary judgment because there was no issue of material fact as to causation and damages. Further, Teeter counters that the declaratory action is the appropriate method to resolve this case. Finally, Teeter contends the District Court properly disregarded the opinions of Mid-Century\u2019s Doctors because they provided unsworn testimony and lacked foundation.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-11\">\u00b614 The Montana Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act provides the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-12\">Any person interested under a deed, will, written contract, or other writings constituting a contract or whose rights, status, or other legal relations are affected by statute, municipal ordinance, contract or franchise may have determined any question of construction or validity arising under the instrument, statute, ordinances, contract or franchise and obtain a declaration of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>rights, status or other legal relations thereunder.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">Section 27-8-202, MCA. Thus, a declaratory action is appropriate to \u201cafford relief from uncertainty with respect to rights, status and other legal relations.\u201d <em>Tarlton v. Kaufman, </em>2008 MT 462, \u00b6 33, 348 Mont. 178, 199 P.3d 263. \u201cA declaratory proceeding is primarily intended to determine the meaning of law or a contract and to adjudicate the rights of the parties therein, but not to determine controversial issues of fact such as the existence or denial of procedural due process.\u201d <em>Tarlton, </em>\u00b6 33 (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">\u00b615 In <em>Ridley v. Guaranty Nat\u2019l Ins. Co., </em>the plaintiff sought a declaratory judgment that \u00a7\u00a7 33-18-201(6) and (13), MCA, required an insurer to pay medical expenses as they were incurred when the tortfeasor\u2019s liability was reasonably clear. 286 Mont. 325, 332-33, 951 P.2d 987, 991 (1997). We held that under the statutes an insurer is required to pay an injured third party\u2019s medical expenses when liability is reasonably clear for the expense that is submitted. <em>Ridley, </em>286 Mont. at 334, 951 P.2d at 992. However, \u201ceven though liability for the accident may be reasonably clear, an insurer may still dispute a medical expense if it is not reasonably clear that the expense is causally related to the accident in <em>question.\u201dRidley, </em>286 Mont. at 334, 951 P.2d at 992. Therefore, <em>Ridley </em>is a two-part test: (1) whether liability is reasonably clear and (2) whether it is reasonably clear that a medical expense is causally related to the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-7\">\u00b616 We later clarified our \u201creasonably clear\u201d legal standard in <em>Peterson v. St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co., </em>2010 MT 187, 357 Mont. 293, 238 P.3d 904. We adopted the following standard: liability is reasonably clear \u201cwhen a reasonable person, with knowledge of the relevant facts and law, would conclude, for good reason, that the defendant is liable to the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Peterson, </em>\u00b6 39. Further, we concluded that if liability was reasonably clear it \u201cwould leave little room for objectively reasonable debate.\u201d <em>Peterson, </em>\u00b6 39. Essentially, the reasonably clear standard of <em>Ridley </em>is comparable to the \u201cclear and convincing evidence\u201d standard. <em>Peterson, </em>\u00b6 37. Even though in <em>Peterson </em>we only addressed whether liability is reasonably clear, the reasonably clear standard applies to the causal relationship of a medical expense and the accident as set forth in <em>Ridley. </em>Therefore, if there is an objectively reasonable debate about whether a medical expense is causally related to the accident then a <em>Ridley </em>declaratory action would be inappropriate because a controversial issue of fact exists.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-8\">\u00b617 Our <em>Ridley </em>cases demonstrate that <em>a Ridley </em>declaratory claim is an inappropriate method to resolve disputed issues of material fact. Our decision in <em>Giambra v. Travelers Indem. Co., </em>is instructive. 2003 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>MT 289, 318 Mont. 73, 78 P.3d 880. In <em>Giambra, </em>the plaintiffs filed a declaratory action under <em>Ridley </em>arguing that liability was reasonably clear and that Travelers was obligated to advance pay medical expenses. <em>Giambra, </em>\u00b6 12. The district court disagreed. The district court determined that there was a conflict in the evidence as to negligence and therefore liability was not reasonably clear. <em>Giambra, </em>\u00b6 14. Thus, the district court granted Travelers\u2019 motion for summary judgment dismissing the declaratory action. We affirmed, holding that summary judgment was appropriate because there was a clear issue of material fact that should be resolved in a negligence action and that Travelers had no obligation under <em>Ridley. Giambra, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 15-16. Therefore, Giambra would have to pursue reimbursement through a negligence suit against Travelers\u2019 insured tortfeasor. Subsequently, Giambra brought a negligence action against the tortfeasor to resolve the disputed issues of material fact, evidenced by our decision in <em>Giambra v. Kelsey, </em>2007 MT 158, 338 Mont. 19, 162 P.3d 134.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">\u00b618 Similarly, in <em>Safeco Ins. Co. v. Montana Eighth Judicial Dist. Court, </em>we held that disputed facts should be left to a jury. 2000 MT 153, 300 Mont. 123, 2 P.3d 834. In <em>Safeco, </em>the plaintiff brought a declaratory action<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> seeking advance payment of medical expenses. <em>Safeco, </em>\u00b6 5. Safeco\u2019s insured admitted liability and the district court concluded there were no disputed material facts concerning causation. <em>Safeco, </em>\u00b6 9. Therefore, the declaratory action was proper to establish plaintiff s right under <em>Ridley </em>that Safeco must as a matter of law pay the undisputed medical expenses. <em>Safeco, </em>\u00b6 20. Then, the district court determined the only matter reserved for <em>trial </em>would be damages since Safeco reasonably disputed a portion of the medical expenses. <em>Safeco, </em>\u00b6 24. We upheld the district court\u2019s ruling. <em>Safeco, </em>\u00b6 34. Thus, we conclude that based on the purpose of the Declaratory Judgments Act and our <em>Ridley </em>cases, a <em>Ridley </em>declaratory claim is an inappropriate method to adjudicate disputed issues of material fact as to causation.</p>\n<p id=\"A_d\">\u00b619 Next, we turn to whether a disputed issue of material fact exists in this case. The District Court concluded that there was no disputed issue of material fact regarding causation or damages. The District Court came to this conclusion because it rejected Mid-Century\u2019s Doctors\u2019 affidavits for two reasons: (1) Mid-Century\u2019s affidavits of the Doctors were unsworn affidavits, and (2) the Doctors lacked foundation. We conclude the District Court erred in disregarding the Doctors\u2019 affidavits and opinions.</p>\n<p id=\"A86\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>\u00b620  First, the District Court determined that the affidavits of the Doctors did not comply with M. R. Civ. P. 56. However, each of the Doctors\u2019 affidavits properly stated that they were made based on personal knowledge, the affiants were competent to testify, and represented the attached doctors\u2019 reports were true and correct. Thus, the Doctors\u2019 affidavits do comply with M. R. Civ. P. 56(e). Second, the District Court determined that the Doctors\u2019 opinions lacked foundation to opine about Teeter\u2019s pre-accident conditions because they relied on post-accident records. However, the Doctors relied on Teeter\u2019s medical history that documented her pre-accident counseling history, which was later corroborated in Teeter\u2019s deposition. Further, the appropriate method to challenge foundation for the Doctors\u2019 opinions is on cross-examination at trial because whether the expert reliably applied the reliable field to the facts is a question of fact for a jury to decide. <em>Beehler v. E. Radiological Assocs. P.C., </em>2012 MT 260, \u00b6 35, 367 Mont. 21, 289 P.3d 131. Therefore, the Doctors\u2019 affidavits and opinions should have been considered in determining whether a disputed issue of material fact existed regarding causation and damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">\u00b621 Having determined the District Court erroneously disregarded the Doctors\u2019 affidavits, we now balance the evidence presented by both parties to determine whether a disputed issue of material fact exists regarding whether Teeter\u2019s remaining damages are causally related to the accident. Teeter presented the following evidence to support that her treatments were causally related to the accident: her own sworn affidavit and the affidavits of her treating physicians. In their affidavits, Teeter\u2019s treating physicians maintained that all of Teeter\u2019s treatments were reasonable and necessary to treat her injuries from the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">\u00b622 Mid-Century countered by presenting evidence of the Doctors\u2019 opinions that disputed the ongoing medical expenses and wage losses were causally related to the accident. Specifically, Dr. Wilson and Dr. Heid opined that Teeter\u2019s ongoing treatments were excessive for the normal standard of care for her injuries. Dr. Heid asserts there is no physiological basis for Teeter\u2019s pain complaints and diagnosed her with chronic pain syndrome. Further, Dr. Stratford opined that Teeter\u2019s pain complaints stem from a psychological condition rather than from injuries suffered in the accident. Lastly, Dr. Wilson and Dr. Heid dispute that Teeter\u2019s wage losses are reasonable because there is no objective evidence that Teeter has any physical or vocational restrictions from the accident. Fundamentally, Mid-Century\u2019s experts set forth a disputed issue of material fact regarding causation and damages.</p>\n<p id=\"AK9F\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>\u00b623  We conclude after balancing Teeter\u2019s affidavits against the Doctors\u2019 affidavits there remains a clear disputed issue of material fact regarding causation and damages. Thus, it is not reasonably clear that Teeter\u2019s ongoing medical expenses are causally related to the accident because there is a reasonable debate. Therefore, we conclude that the District Court erred in granting Teeter summary judgment on her <em>Ridley </em>declaratory action.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">\u00b624 We conclude that the District Court erred in granting Teeter\u2019s motion for summary judgment. A declaratory action is an inappropriate method to resolve disputed issues of material fact. Here, there is a clear dispute of material fact regarding causation because it is not reasonably clear if Teeter\u2019s remaining expenses are causally related to the accident. Further, the District Court\u2019s order granting fees and costs to Teeter is reversed because granting summary judgment to Teeter was in error. We reverse and remand for further proceedings consistent with this Opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-7\">\u00b625 Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b440-8\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES BAKER, McKINNON, SANDEFUR and RICE concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b435-8\"> Additionally, Mid-Century filed a motion in limine which was granted in part and denied in part by the District Court\u2019s December 30, 2016 Opinion and Order.
