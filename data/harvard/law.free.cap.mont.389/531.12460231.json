The District Court\u2019s order denied Akers\u2019s motion to dismiss, affirmed the Justice Court\u2019s judgment, and remanded the case to the Justice Court to enforce its judgment. We reverse and remand for further proceedings consistent with this Opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">\u00b62 Akers presents three issues on appeal. First, Akers argues the Justice Court erred by not instructing the jury that the State carried the burden of proving Akers\u2019s actions were not a justifiable use of force. Second, Akers argues his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to request such an instruction. Third, Akers argues he was denied the right of confrontation when the State presented its witnesses through Skype testimony. We conclude that the Justice Court erred by not instructing the jury that the State carried the burden of proving Akers\u2019s actions were not a justifiable use of force and reverse. Accordingly, it is unnecessary to address Akers\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim. Further, because these proceedings are being remanded, we decline to issue an advisory opinion addressing the propriety of the State\u2019s use of Skype testimony. We restate the dispositive issue as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-6\">\n<em>Whether this Court should exercise plain error review to reverse Akers\u2019s conviction because the jury was not instructed on the burden of proof for justifiable use of force.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b558-9\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b558-10\">\u00b63 Akers travelled from Tennessee to Montana with four friends, Terri Gilley (Gilley), Myron Tipton (Tipton), Terri McFarland, and Scott Marcha, to attend a music concert. While in Montana, the group also visited Yellowstone National Park and stayed in a cabin in Park County. Gilley and Akers had several arguments during the trip and on September 1,2015, a physical altercation ensued. As a result, Gilley left the cabin and contacted local police. Park County Sheriff s Deputy Pete Adams (Adams) met with Gilley and observed a scratch on her cheek and several bruises on both of her arms. Adams subsequently arrested Akers and cited him with misdemeanor assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-11\">\u00b64 The facts surrounding the physical altercation are disputed. According to Gilley, in response to something Akers said, Gilley threw a cup containing ice and soda at Akers\u2019s head. After throwing the cup at Akers, Gilley attempted to run away, but Akers grabbed Gilley, shoved her, and hit her several times. Akers presents a different version of the incident. Akers maintains that, without provocation, Gilley threw the cup and contents at his head and then approached him. Akers then grabbed Gilley\u2019s wrists to prevent her from scratching <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>or hitting him. Holding onto her wrists, Akers attempted to back Gilley out of the cabin\u2019s front door, but Gilley fell to the floor and she, again, tried to scratch him from her position on the floor. Akers believes it was at this point that Gilley scratched herself in the face.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">\u00b65 Prior to trial, the State filed a motion to allow testimony of witnesses at trial through Skype, a software application and video conferencing platform, which allows for real-time audio and video telecommunication. The State cited the burden of travel as its cause for filing the motion. On December 22,2015, the Justice Court granted the State\u2019s motion in a single-sentence order.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">\u00b66 The Justice Court held a jury trial on January 29, 2016. At trial, Akers relied on the defense of justifiable use of force. Akers presented witnesses who testified to a version of the incident largely consistent with his own. The State presented witnesses who testified to a version of the incident largely consistent with Gilley\u2019s. Gilley testified through Skype from Tennessee. The State presented an additional rebuttal witness, Sheldon Ziro, who also testified through Skype from Tennessee. Akers\u2019s witnesses all testified personally in court. The jury convicted Akers of assault and the Justice Court sentenced him to pay afine of $300, court costs of $85, and jury costs of $806.52. The Justice Court stayed enforcement of its judgment pending Akers\u2019s appeal to the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-7\">\u00b67 On appeal, Akers filed a motion to dismiss and raised two arguments. First, Akers argued Article VII, Section 4, of the Montana Constitution, entitled him to a trial de novo in the District Court because the Justice Court judge was not an attorney. Second, Akers argued the confrontation clause of the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution; Article II, Section 24, of the Montana Constitution; M. R. Evid. 611(e); and \u00a7 46-16-201, MCA, entitled him to confront the witnesses against him in person, not through Skype. The District Court denied Akers\u2019s motion to dismiss, affirmed the Justice Court\u2019s judgment, and remanded the case to the Justice Court to enforce its judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-8\">\u00b68 Akers appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-9\">STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b559-10\">\u00b69 When district courts function as intermediate appellate courts for appeals from lower courts of record, this Court reviews the appeal de novo as though it were originally filed in this Court. Section 3-5-303, MCA; <em>Bozeman v. Cantu, </em>2013 MT 40, \u00b6 10, 369 Mont. 81, 296 P.3d 461 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b559-11\">\u00b610 Generally, an appellate court does not address issues raised for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>the first time on appeal. <em>State v. Favel, </em>2015 MT 336, \u00b6 13, 381 Mont. 472, 362 P.3d 1126. Plain error review is an exception to this general rule where we may consider issues raised for the first time on appeal. <em>Favel, </em>\u00b6 13; <em>State v. Finley, </em>276 Mont. 126, 137, 915 P.2d 208, 215 (1996), <em>overruled on other grounds by, State v. Gallagher, </em>2001 MT 39, \u00b6 21, 304 Mont. 215, 19 P.3d 817. \u201c[CJourts invoke plain error review to correct error not objected to at trial but that affects the fairness, integrity, and public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Finley, </em>276 Mont. at 134, 915 P.2d at 213. To reverse a decision for plain error, the appellant must: (1) demonstrate that the claimed error implicates a fundamental right; and (2) firmly convince this Court that a failure to review the claimed error would result in a manifest miscarriage of justice, leave unsettled the question of the fundamental fairness of the trial or proceedings, or compromise the integrity of the judicial process. <em>Favel, </em>\u00b6 23 (quotations omitted) (citing <em>State v. Daniels, </em>2011 MT 278, \u00b6 32, 362 Mont. 426, 265 P.3d 623).</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">\u00b611 As a preliminary matter, Akers satisfied his burden of producing evidence sufficient to place his affirmative defense of justifiable use of force at issue. <em>See Daniels, </em>\u00b6 15. Akers gave notice to the State of his intention to raise justifiable use of force in advance of trial. Akers and Tipton testified that Gilley struck Akers in the head with a cup and that Gilley moved forward to scratch at Akers with her nails. Akers then sought to defend himself by restraining Gilley to prevent Gilley from scratching him. Akers, accordingly, offered evidence of his affirmative defense of justifiable use of force and properly placed the defense at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-7\">\u00b612 Section 46-16-131, MCA, provides that \u201cwhen the defendant has offered evidence of justifiable use of force, the state has the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant\u2019s actions were not justified.\u201d \u201cCourts may not disregard the plain language of a statute.\u201d <em>State v. Cooksey, </em>2012 MT 226, \u00b6 32, 366 Mont. 346, 286 P.3d 1174 (citation omitted). However, neither Akers nor the State requested or submitted a proposed jury instruction, which properly instructed the jury on the burden of proof pursuant to \u00a7 46-16-131, MCA; nor did the Justice Court sua sponte instruct the jury on the State\u2019s burden. The only issues Akers presented to the District Court on appeal were that a non-lawyer judge presided over the Justice Court trial and that his constitutional right of confrontation was violated by the State\u2019s presentation of Skype testimony. Generally, \u201ca reviewing court can consider only those issues that are properly preserved for its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>review.\u201d In <em>re Transfer Territory from Poplar Elementary Sch. Dist. No. 9 to Froid Elementary Sch. Dist. No. 65, </em>2015 MT 278, \u00b6 13, 381 Mont. 145, 364 P.3d 1222 (citing <em>In re T.E., </em>2002 MT 195, \u00b6 20, 311 Mont. 148, 54 P.3d 38. \u201cIn order to preserve a claim or objection for appeal, an appellant must first raise that specific claim or objection in the [lower court].\u201d <em>In re T.E., </em>\u00b6 20. \u201cThe basis for the general rule is that it is fundamentally unfair to fault the trial court for failing to rule correctly on an issue it was never given the opportunity to consider.\u201d <em>Unified Indus., Inc. v. Easley, </em>1998 MT 145, \u00b6 15, 289 Mont. 255, 961 P.2d 100 (quotations and citation omitted). The parties agree that the failure to properly instruct the jury on the burden of proof for justifiable use of force was not raised in the Justice Court or District Court and, therefore, was not preserved.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">\u00b613 Despite Akers\u2019s failure to preserve this issue at the Justice Court and failure to raise the issue at the District Court, this Court may, as Akers recommends, exercise plain error review. \u201c[T]he plain error doctrine is to be employed sparingly, on a case-by-case basis\u201d considering the \u201ctotality of circumstances of each case.\u201d <em>State v. Lindberg, </em>2008 MT 389, \u00b6 34, 347 Mont. 76, 196 P.3d 1252 (quotations and citation omitted). When a \u201ccriminal defendant\u2019s fundamental rights are invoked, we may choose to review a claim under the common law plain error doctrine where failing to review the claimed error may result in a manifest miscarriage of justice, may leave unsettled the question of the fundamental fairness of the trial or proceedings, or may compromise the integrity of the judicial process.\u201d <em>State v. Taylor, </em>2010 MT 94, \u00b6 12, 356 Mont. 167, 231 P.3d 79 (citation omitted). For this Court to reverse under plain error, Akers must first demonstrate that the claimed error implicates a fundamental right. <em>Favel, </em>\u00b6 23. Akers argues his \u201cfundamental right to be protected from conviction except upon presentation of proof beyond a reasonable doubt of every fact that Montana requires to constitute a crime, including the absence of justification\u201d was implicated by the Justice Court\u2019s failure to instruct the jury on the State\u2019s burden of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">\u00b614 The interests of a criminal defendant \u201care of such magnitude that historically and without any explicit constitutional requirement they have been protected by standards of proof designed to exclude as nearly as possible the likelihood of an erroneous judgment.\u201d <em>Addington v. Texas, </em>441 U.S. 418, 423, 99 S. Ct. 1804, 1808 (1979) (footnote omitted). \u201cThis is accomplished by requiring under the Due Process Clause that the state prove the guilt of an accused beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Addington, </em>441 U.S. at 423-24, 99 S. Ct. at 1808 <em>(citing In re Winship, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>397 U.S. 358, 370, 90 S. Ct. 1068, 1076 (1970) (Harlan, J., concurring)). The formula \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d is accepted in common law jurisdictions \u201cas the measure of persuasion by which the prosecution must convince the trier of all essential elements of guilt,\u201d and its universal acceptance reflects \u201ca profound judgment about the way in which law should be enforced and justice administered.\u201d <em>In re Winship, </em>397 U.S. at 361-62, 90 S. Ct. at 1071 (quotations and citations omitted); <em>In re J.S., </em>2017 MT 214, \u00b6 23, 388 Mont. 397, 401 P.3d 197.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">\u00b615 Consonant with these principles, Montana requires that the \u201cjury is to be instructed by the court on all proper occasions ... [and] that in criminal cases guilt must be established beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d Section 26-1-403, MCA. We have explained, in the context of the affirmative defense of justifiable use of force, that the State carries the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant\u2019s actions were not justified, <em>in addition </em>to proving each element of the crime of assault beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>State v. Erickson, </em>2014 MT 304, \u00b6 25, 377 Mont. 84, 338 P.3d 598 (\u201cIn 2009, ... the Legislature enacted legislation [\u00a7 46-16-131, MCA] designed to shift the burden to the State to prove the absence of justification in self-defense claims.\u201d (citation omitted)). \u201c[W]hile the district court\u2019s discretion is broad, it is ultimately restricted by the overriding principle that jury instructions must fully and fairly instruct the jury regarding the applicable law.\u201d <em>State v. Archambault, </em>2007 MT 26, \u00b6 25, 336 Mont. 6, 152 P.3d 698 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">\u00b616 In light of the foregoing principles, we conclude that failure to instruct the jury of the State\u2019s burden of proof implicated Akers\u2019s fundamental right to a fair trial. <em>Addington, </em>441 U.S. at 423-24, 99 S. Ct. at 1808; <em>In re J.S., </em>\u00b6 23. At trial, Akers argued that his actions constituted self-defense, not assault. Section 46-16-131, MCA, places the burden on the State of proving Akers\u2019s actions towards Gilley were not justified. The State had the burden of provingbeyond a reasonable doubt that Akers\u2019s actions were not justified, in addition to proving each element of the crime with which Akers was charged. We therefore agree with Akers that the jury made its determination without being fully and fairly instructed of the applicable law, which was an error that implicated his fundamental rights.</p>\n<p id=\"aat-dedup-0\">\u00b617  Having determined Akers has satisfied the first element to establish plain error, we turn to the second. This Court will review and reverse a decision for plain error if we are convinced that a failure to do so will result in a manifest miscarriage of justice, leave unsettled the question of the fundamental fairness of the trial or proceedings, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>compromise the integrity of the judicial process. <em>Favel, </em>\u00b6 23. While Akers\u2019s claimed error potentially implicates each of the listed criteria, we are convinced that, at a minimum, allowing his conviction to stand will leave unsettled the question of the fundamental fairness of the proceeding. The failure to properly instruct on the State\u2019s burden of proof implicates whether the State met its burden of proof in establishing Akers\u2019s guilt. As we have recognized, an accused is \u201cprotected by standards of proof designed to exclude as nearly as possible the likelihood of an erroneous judgment.\u201d <em>Addington, </em>441 U.S. at 423, 99 S. Ct. at 1808 (footnote omitted). Where a jury has not been properly instructed on the highest measure of proof\u2014beyond a reasonable doubt\u2014and who carries that burden, we cannot be assured of the fairness or have confidence in its determination of guilt. This is particularly true given that the error occurred within the context of a defense wherein the burden is normally shouldered by the accused. We conclude that the Justice Court\u2019s failure to instruct the jury that the State bore the burden of proving Akers\u2019s actions were not justified beyond a reasonable doubt denied Akers a fair trial and will leave unsettled the fundamental fairness of the proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">\u00b618 Lastly, we address several arguments made by the State\u2014specifically, that this Court may not consider Akers\u2019s claimed jury instruction error because Akers failed to raise it at the District Court or first-level appellate court. The State contends that in <em>Missoula v. Asbury, </em>265 Mont. 14, 873 P.2d 936 (1994), this Court held issues not raised at the first-level appellate court cannot be properly raised before this Court. The State concludes that allowing Akers to present his jury instruction argument to this Court after failing to preserve it in the Justice Court and failing to raise it in the District Court would allow Akers to add a new legal theory \u201con his third bite at the apple.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">\u00b619 Although procedurally similar, the State\u2019s reliance on <em>Asbury </em>is misplaced. In <em>Asbury, </em>the appellants were several people arrested for blocking patients\u2019 access to a clinic that provided abortions. <em>Asbury, </em>265 Mont. at 16, 873 P.2d at 937. A Municipal Court jury convicted the appellants of trespass, criminal contempt, and disorderly conduct. <em>Asbury, </em>265 Mont. at 16, 873 P.2d at 937. At trial, the appellants raised an international laws or treaty defense. <em>Asbury, </em>265 Mont. at 19-20, 873 P.2d at 939. The appellants appealed to the district court, but did not present the international laws or treaty defense issue. <em>Asbury, </em>265 Mont. at 19-20, 873 P.2d at 939. The district court affirmed the convictions and appellants then appealed to this Court, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>raising their international laws or treaty defense again. <em>Asbury, </em>265 Mont. at 19-20, 873 P.2d at 939. In declining to address the issue, we stated \u201cbased on the Appellants\u2019 failure to raise the treaty issue at the first appellate level in the District Court, we conclude that the issue is not properly before us.\u201d <em>Asbury, </em>265 Mont. at 20, 873 P.2d at 939. In <em>Asbury, </em>we held that the appellants failed to preserve the issue for our review because they abandoned the argument by not raising it at the district court level. <em>Asbury, </em>265 Mont. at 20, 873 P.2d at 939 (\u201cHere, of course, the \u2018treaty\u2019 issue <em>was </em>presented to the trial court which, in this instance, was the Municipal Court. However, the treaty issue was not presented to the first-level appellate court\u2014here, the District Court.\u201d (emphasis in original)).</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">\u00b620 In contrast, Akers has not previously raised, before any other court, the error we address here. The principle underlying plain error review is \u201cto correct error not objected to at trial but that affects the fairness, integrity, and public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Finley, </em>276 Mont. at 134, 915 P.2d at 213. The plain error doctrine \u201cis a doctrine that a reviewing court invokes in order to rectify a trial court ruling that, although either not properly preserved or never raised at all in the trial court, nonetheless requires reversal of the trial court\u2019s judgment, for reasons of policy.\u201d 5 Am. Jur. 2d <em>Appellate Review </em>\u00a7716 (2014). This Court\u2019s power to conduct plain error review \u201cis inherent in the appellate process itself.\u201d <em>Finley, </em>276 Mont. at 134, 915 P.2d at 213 (\u201cAppellate courts have the inherent duty to interpret the constitution and to protect individual rights set forth in the constitution and necessarily have the correlative authority to invoke the plain error doctrine in order to carry out those duties.\u201d (citation omitted)). If the error is preserved, we apply a harmless error standard of review and the State has the burden of demonstrating the error was harmless. Conversely, if a defendant fails to properly preserve his or her issue for appeal, we apply the plain error standard of review and the defendant has the burden of proof. In <em>Asbury, </em>the Court did not consider plain error review; thus, the claimed error must have been preserved at the first-level appellate court in order for this Court to consider the issue. However, where a reversal is warranted following application of plain error review, this Court may exercise its discretion to rectify a trial court judgment that, as here, leaves unsettled the question of the fundamental fairness of the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b564-7\">\u00b621 We exercise plain error review to reverse Akers\u2019s conviction.
