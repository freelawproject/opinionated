After a few months on the job, Tedesco signed an employment agreement containing a provision that required the parties to submit any disputes to binding arbitration. HSOA terminated Tedesco\u2019s employment in 2011. Tedesco sued HSOA, its CEO and Board Chair Dirk Adams, and Home Savings Bancorp (HSBC), which owned all of HSOA\u2019s stock. Tedesco alleged wrongful discharge, breach of contract, and fraud. The District Court ordered the parties to proceed to binding arbitration. The Arbitrator issued an award in favor of Adams and HSBC,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and the District Court confirmed the award. Tedesco appeals both the order compelling arbitration and the order confirming the award. We affirm both orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-4\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">\u00b62 Tedesco worked as a regional manager for First National Mortgage Sources until 2008. In that position, he oversaw lending branches and created a lending platform to secure mortgages for First National Bank. When First National Bank decided to shed First National Mortgage Sources, it granted Tedesco permission to move his branches and lending platform to another institution.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">\u00b63 Tedesco contacted Adams, and the two negotiated an agreement under which HSOA\u2014a Minnesota corporation\u2014would employ Tedesco to move his branches and lending platform to HSOA. Tedesco signed HSOA\u2019s Employee Handbook Acknowledgment and an Alternative Dispute Resolution Agreement on February 22, 2008. The Alternative Dispute Resolution Agreement stated that Tedesco agreed to arbitrate any disputes arising from his employment with HSOA. Tedesco began his work with HSOA in March 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-7\">\u00b64 Shortly after Tedesco signed the Handbook Acknowledgment and the Alternative Dispute Resolution Agreement, Adams asked Tedesco to prepare an employment agreement. Tedesco prepared a proposed agreement with the assistance of counsel and presented it to Adams in April 2008. Adams rejected Tedesco\u2019s proposed agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-8\">\u00b65 In July 2008, Adams presented Tedesco with a \u201cRetail Regional Manager Terms of Employment\u201d (Employment Agreement). The Employment Agreement contained this \u201cEnforcement\u201d provision: \u201cAny <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>and all disputes arising under or related to the Agreement shall be resolved by binding arbitration under the auspices of, and according to the rules promulgated by, the American Arbitration Association - Commercial Mediation Rules.\u201d The Employment Agreement also stated that Tedesco\u2019s employment was \u201cterminable at the will of either party.\u201d Tedesco signed the Employment Agreement on July 30, 2008. Tedesco later testified that he would have faced immediate termination had he not signed the agreement. He claimed also that, by July 2008, he already had moved his branches and lending platform to HSOA and relocated his family.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-4\">\u00b66 HSOA terminated Tedesco\u2019s employment on June 1,2011. Tedesco filed a complaint in August 2011 against Adams and \u201cHome Savings Bancorp, Inc., d/b/a Home Savings of America.\u201d He asserted wrongful discharge under the Montana Wrongful Discharge from Employment Act (WDEA), breach of contract, fraud, constructive fraud, and fraud in the inducement.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">\u00b67 When Tedesco refused to submit to arbitration, HSBC and Adams filed a motion to compel arbitration and to stay the action, or to dismiss the complaint under M. R. Civ. P. 12. The District Court issued an order in February 2015 compelling arbitration through the American Arbitration Association (AAA) and staying the proceedings pending the outcome of the arbitration. The court found that, although the February 2008 Handbook Acknowledgment and Alternative Dispute Resolution Agreement did not constitute valid contracts, the July 2008 Employment Agreement\u2019s arbitration provision was binding on the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">\u00b68 At arbitration, the parties submitted evidence and participated in an evidentiary hearing, at which Tedesco and Adams testified. In August 2016, the Arbitrator granted summary judgment to Adams and HSBC on Tedesco\u2019s wrongful discharge, breach of contract, and fraud claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-7\">\u00b69 Tedesco filed an application with the District Court in October 2016 to vacate, correct, or modify the Arbitrator\u2019s award. The court denied Tedesco\u2019s application. It reasoned that its role was not to \u201creview the merits of the controversy,\u201d and it referenced the Arbitrator\u2019s \u201cbroad authority and powers to determine all issues.\u201d The District Court then entered judgment confirming the Arbitrator\u2019s award. Tedesco appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-8\">STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b496-9\">\u00b610 This Court reviews de novo a district court\u2019s order on a motion to compel arbitration. <em>Global Client Solutions, LLC v. Ossello, </em>2016 MT 50, \u00b6 19, 382 Mont. 345, 367 P.3d 361.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>\u00b611 A district court\u2019s review of an arbitration award is strictly limited by Montana\u2019s Uniform Arbitration Act (UAA). <em>Paulson v. Flathead Conservation Dist., </em>2004 MT 136, \u00b6 24, 321 Mont. 364, 91 P.3d 569; <em>Geissler v. Sanem, </em>285 Mont. 411, 415, 949 P.2d 234, 237 (1997). We review district court decisions on arbitration awards like any other district court decision, accepting findings of fact that are not clearly erroneous but deciding questions of law de novo. <em>City of Livingston v. Mont. Puh. Emps. Ass\u2019n ex rel. Tubaugh, </em>2014 MT 314, \u00b6 11, 377 Mont. 184, 339 P.3d 41. We review a district court\u2019s ultimate decision to confirm an arbitration award for an abuse of discretion. <em>Colstrip Energy Ltd. P\u2019ship v. Nw.

P\u2019ship, </em>\u00b6 18. In reviewing whether the District Court abused its discretion in confirming the arbitration award, we apply the law that a court cannot review the merits of the controversy, but may only confirm, vacate, modify, or correct an arbitration award pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 27-5-311, -312, and -313, MCA. <em>Roberts v. Lame Deer Pub. Sch. Dist. #6, </em>2013 MT 358, \u00b6 7, 373 Mont. 49, 314 P.3d 647.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">\u00b613 \u201cThe Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) governs contracts that involve interstate <em>commerce.\u201d Kelker v. Geneva-Roth Ventures, Inc., </em>2013 MT 62, \u00b6 11, 369 Mont. 254, 303 P.3d 777. The FAA preempts state laws that \u201cprohibit outright the arbitration of a particular type of claim.\u201d <em>Kelker, </em>\u00b6 15 (citing <em>AT&amp;T Mobility LLC v. Concepcion, </em>563 U.S. 333, 341, 131 S. Ct. 1740, 1747 (2011)). \u201cHowever, when a state law does not conflict with the FAA so as to frustrate the objectives of Congress, it is not necessarily preempted.\u201d <em>Keystone, Inc. v. Triad Sys. Corp., </em>1998 MT 326, \u00b6 23, 292 Mont. 229, 971 P.2d 1240. The FAA preempts a state law \u201cto the extent that it stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress\u201d in enacting the FAA. <em>Sakkab v. Luxottica Retail N. Am., Inc., </em>803 F.3d 425, 432 (9th Cir. 2015). The Employment Agreement between Tedesco and HSO A involved interstate commerce: HSO A was a Minnesota corporation, Tedesco was a Montana resident, and Tedesco\u2019s work with HSO A involved doing business across state lines. The FAA therefore applies to the Employment Agreement\u2019s arbitration clause. <em>See Kelker, </em>\u00b6 11. Montana\u2019s UAA also applies to the extent that it does not conflict with the FAA\u2019s objectives. <em>See Sakkab, </em>803 F.3d at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>432.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-4\">\u00b614 <em>1. Whether the District Court erred in compelling arbitration.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">\u00b615 Tedesco argues that the District Court erred in ordering the parties to proceed to arbitration. He contends that the Employment Agreement generally and the arbitration clause specifically were invalid. In his view, because there was no valid agreement between the parties to arbitrate their disputes, the District Court should have denied Adams\u2019s and HSBC\u2019s motion to compel arbitration. Adams and HSBC challenge Tedesco\u2019s appeal of the District Court\u2019s order compelling arbitration as untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">A. Timeliness of Tedesco\u2019s Appeal of the Order Compelling Arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-8\">\u00b616 The District Court issued its order compelling arbitration on February 26, 2015, and it simultaneously stayed the proceedings. Adams and HSBC argue that the order was \u201cfinal and appealable\u201d and therefore that Tedesco had thirty days to appeal it. Because Tedesco did not appeal the order compelling arbitration until March 2017\u2014over two years later\u2014Adams and HSBC urge the Court not to hear his appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-9\">\u00b617 The Montana Rules of Appellate Procedure provide that notice of appeal in civil cases \u201cshall be filed with the clerk of the supreme court within 30 days from the date of entry of the judgment or order from which the appeal is taken.\u201d M. R. App. P. 4(5)(a)(i). The Rules allow a party to appeal from a \u201cfinal judgment in an action\u201d or from specified \u201cfinal orders\u201d in civil cases. M. R. App. P. 6(1), (3). The list of orders from which appeal may be taken does not include orders compelling arbitration. <em>See </em>M. R. App. P. 6(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b498-10\">\u00b618 Montana\u2019s UAA also specifies certain rulings from which a party may appeal, including: \u201can order denying an application to compel arbitration\u201d; \u201can order granting an application to stay arbitration\u201d; \u201can order confirming or denying confirmation of an award\u201d; \u201can order modifying or correcting an award\u201d; \u201can order vacating an award without directing a rehearing\u201d; or \u201ca judgment entered pursuant to the provisions of\u2019 the UAA. Section 27-5-324(1), MCA. The list does not include orders compelling arbitration. <em>See </em>\u00a7 27-5-324(1), MCA. The FAA states that \u201can appeal may <em>not </em>be taken from an interlocutory order ... compelling arbitration.\u201d 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 16(b)(3) (emphasis added). \u00b619 Adams and HSBC cite our decisions in <em>Iwen v. U. S. W. Direct, </em>1999 MT 63, 293 Mont. 512, 977 P.2d 989, and <em>Larsen v. Opie, </em>237 Mont. 108, 771 P.2d 977 (1989), for the proposition that interlocutory orders compelling arbitration are immediately appealable under the FAA. In <em>Iwen, </em>the district court granted U.S. West Direct\u2019s motion to compel arbitration and to stay the proceedings. In holding that this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>Court had jurisdiction to hear the appeal, we explained, \u201cWe have recently addressed the issue of the appealability of orders to arbitrate within the context of the Federal Arbitration Act and concluded that an order compelling arbitration is final and appealable.\u201d <em>Iwen, </em>\u00b6 18 (citing <em>Larsen, </em>237 Mont. at 110, 771 P.2d at 979).</p>\n<p id=\"b499-4\">\u00b620 In <em>Larsen, </em>the district court granted Opie\u2019s motion to compel arbitration. <em>Larsen, </em>237 Mont. at 109, 771 P.2d at 978. We held that the court\u2019s order compelling arbitration was \u201cfinal\u201d and \u201cappealable,\u201d reasoning that it constituted \u201ca final determination of the District Court.\u201d <em>Larsen, </em>237 Mont. at 110, 771 P.2d at 979.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">\u00b621 This Court decided <em>Larsen </em>in 1989 and <em>Iwen </em>in 1999. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals held recently that the FAA \u201cbars appeals of interlocutory orders compelling arbitration and staying judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Johnson v. Consumerinfo.com, Inc., </em>745 F.3d 1019, 1021 (9th Cir. 2014) (citing 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 16(b)); <em>accord MediVas, LLC v. Marubeni Corp., </em>741 F.3d 4, 7 (9th Cir. 2014) (holding that \u201can order compelling arbitration may be appealed if the district court dismisses all the underlying claims, but may not be appealed if the court stays the action pending arbitration\u201d). This authority makes clear that an interlocutory order compelling arbitration, when combined with a stay of the proceedings pending arbitration, is not final and appealable under the FAA. 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 16(b)(3); <em>Johnson, </em>745 F.3d at 1021; <em>MediVas, LLC, </em>741 F.3d at 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">\u00b622 We consistently decline to entertain appeals of orders that are not final orders in the case or that do not meet one of the specific exceptions listed in Rule 6(3). <em>See Johnson v. Booth, </em>2008 MT 155, \u00b6\u00b6 30-31, 343 Mont. 268, 184 P.3d 289 (holding that the district court\u2019s order on discovery sanctions was not a \u201cfinal judgment\u201d and therefore was not reviewable on appeal). And the UAA does not provide for the appeal of interlocutory orders compelling arbitration, although it does authorize appeal from an order denying a motion to compel. Section 27-5-324(1), MCA. Neither the applicable statutes nor the Rules of Appellate Procedure authorize immediate appeal from an order compelling arbitration where the case is not dismissed by that order. To the extent that our decisions in <em>Iwen </em>and <em>Larsen </em>state the contrary, we modify those decisions and hold that interlocutory orders compelling arbitration and staying further proceedings are not immediately appealable. <em>See Iwen, </em>\u00b6 <em>18; Larsen, </em>237 Mont. at 110, 771 P.2d at 979.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-7\">\u00b623 We conclude that the District Court\u2019s interlocutory order compelling arbitration and staying further proceedings was not final and appealable. The thirty-day time bar of M. R. App. P. 4(5)(a)(i) therefore did not apply to that order. Tedesco\u2019s appeal of the order is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>timely.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-4\">B. Whether the Parties Had a Valid Agreement to Arbitrate.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">\u00b624 Tedesco asserts a number of errors in the District Court\u2019s decision to compel arbitration. He contends that the Employment Agreement was invalid because it was a contract of adhesion presented to him on a \u201ctake it or leave it\u201d basis and because its \u201cat will\u201d termination provision violated public policy and the WDEA. He claims also that the arbitration clause was unconscionable and unenforceable because he did not receive a copy of the arbitration rules that the clause referenced and because there was no \u201cmeeting of the minds\u201d on the clause\u2019s essential terms. Finally, he argues that the arbitration clause did not cover his breach of contract and fraud claims and that the District Court should have allowed those claims to proceed in court.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">\u00b625 Tedesco attacks the validity of the Employment Agreement as a whole and of the arbitration clause specifically. \u201cIHinder the FAA, when a party challenges the validity of a contract as a whole, an arbitrator should resolve that dispute in the first instance.\u201d <em>Kelker, </em>\u00b6 12 <em>(citing Nitro-Lift Techs., L.L.C. v. Howard, </em>568 U.S. 17, 20, 133 S. Ct. 500, 503 (2012)); <em>accord Martz v. Beneficial Mont., Inc., </em>2006 MT 94, \u00b6 17, 332 Mont. 93, 135 P.3d 790 (\u201c[AJrbitration, not court, is the proper forum for challenges to contracts as a whole where those contracts contain arbitration provisions.\u201d). The District Court did not err in allowing the Arbitrator to decide the validity of the Employment Agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-7\">\u00b626 \u201cWhen a party challenges the validity of the arbitration clause in a contract, however, a court may resolve that dispute in the first instance.\u201d <em>Kelker, </em>\u00b6 12. The FAA provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-8\">A written provision in ... a contract evidencing a transaction involving commerce to settle by arbitration a controversy thereafter arising out of such contract or transaction, or the refusal to perform the whole or any part thereof... shall be valid, irrevocable, and enforceable, save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b500-9\">9 U.S.C. \u00a7 2. Montana\u2019s UAA similarly provides, \u201cA written agreement to submit to arbitration any controversy arising between the parties after the agreement is made is valid and enforceable except upon grounds that exist at law or in equity for the revocation of a contract.\u201d Section 27-5-114(2), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-10\">\u00b627 Both federal and Montana law apply a \u201cpresumption of arbitrability\u201d to arbitration agreements, under which doubts are \u201cresolved in favor of arbitration.\u201d <em>Ossello, </em>\u00b6 21; <em>Kalispell Educ. Ass\u2019n v. Bd. of Trs., </em>2011 MT 154, \u00b6 18, 361 Mont. 115, 255 P.3d 199 (citing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number><em>Granite Rock Co. v.

Herbergers NBGL, </em>2009 MT 79, \u00b6 15, 349 Mont. 475, 204 P.3d 693. \u201c[I]n deciding whether the parties have agreed to submit a particular grievance to arbitration, a court is not to rule on the potential merits of the underlying claims.\u201d <em>Kalispell Educ. Ass\u2019n, </em>\u00b6 20 (citation and internal quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"AZof\">\u00b628 \u201cAn enforceable agreement to arbitrate must [ ] have the same elements as any contract: namely, identifiable parties with the capacity to contract; the consent of the parties; a lawful object; and consideration. The consent of the parties requires that there be mutual assent or a meeting of the minds on all essential terms to form a binding contract.\u201d <em>Ossello, </em>\u00b6 23 (internal citation and quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b501-4\">\u00b629 Tedesco contends that there was no \u201cmeeting of the minds\u201d as to the essential terms of the arbitration clause because the District Court altered the title of the applicable arbitration rules from the AAA\u2019s \u201cCommercial Mediation Rules\u201d to the AAA\u2019s \u201cCommercial Arbitration Rules.\u201d As the District Court noted, however, the AAA\u2019s manual to which the arbitration clause refers is entitled, \u201cCommercial Arbitration Rules and Mediation Procedures\u201d and contains the AAA\u2019s rules for both arbitration and mediation. The District Court\u2019s revision of what it noted was a \u201csimple misstatement of the official title of the manual in the Employment Agreement\u201d did not alter any of the \u201cessential terms\u201d of the arbitration clause. <em>See Ossello, </em>\u00b6 23. It did not change the fact that there was a \u201cmeeting of the minds\u201d on the parties\u2019 agreement to resolve their disputes by binding arbitration under the auspices of the AAA. <em>See Ossello, </em>\u00b6 23. The arbitration clause thus satisfies the element of having the \u201cconsent of the parties.\u201d <em>See Ossello, </em>\u00b6 23. Tedesco does not allege that the clause failed to meet the other elements of an enforceable agreement: identifiable parties, a lawful object, or consideration. <em>See Ossello, </em>\u00b6 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">\u00b630 Tedesco argues that the arbitration clause was unconscionable and unenforceable in part because the Employment Agreement\u2014including the arbitration clause\u2014was presented to him on a \u201ctake it or leave it\u201d basis and he had no meaningful opportunity to decline or negotiate the terms. He argues that the clause was unconscionable also because he did not receive a copy of the arbitration rules to which the clause referred.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">\u00b631 The test for whether a contract provision\u2014such as an arbitration clause\u2014is unconscionable \u201cinvolves a two-step inquiry: whether the contract qualifies as a contract of adhesion, and whether the contract <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>unreasonably favored the drafter.\u201d <em>Kelker, </em>\u00b6 19. \u201cContracts of adhesion arise when a party possessing superior bargaining power presents a standardized form of agreement to a party whose choice remains either to accept or reject the contract without the opportunity to negotiate its terms.\u201d <em>Kortum-Managhan, </em>\u00b6 23 (citation and internal quotations omitted). \u201cDisparity in bargaining power is an essential element of a contract of adhesion.\u201d Day <em>v.

The party challenging the clause must show that the clause was unreasonably favorable to the drafter, meaning that it \u201ceither (1) was not within [the non-drafting party\u2019s] reasonable expectations, or (2) was within his reasonable expectations, but when considered in context, is unduly oppressive, unconscionable, or against public policy.\u201d <em>Graziano, </em>\u00b6 20; <em>see Kelker, </em>\u00b6 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">\u00b633 \u201c[I]n determining whether a contractual provision proves unconscionable for being outside a party\u2019s reasonable expectations,\u201d courts consider the following factors, among others: \u201cwhether a disparity existed in the bargaining power of the contracting parties\u201d; \u201cwhether a difference in business experience and sophistication of the parties existed\u201d; whether the party agreeing to the provision \u201cwas represented by counsel at the time the agreement was executed\u201d; \u201cwhether economic, social or practical duress compelled a party to execute the contract\u201d; and whether the clause was \u201cambiguous or misleading.\u201d <em>Kelker, </em>\u00b6 21 (citing <em>Kortum-Managhan, </em>\u00b6 27).</p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">\u00b634 In <em>Iwen, </em>we held that an arbitration clause that permitted the drafter to sue over any disputes arising out of an advertising contract but that required the non-drafting party to arbitrate all disputes was unconscionable. <em>Iwen, </em>\u00b6 34. We noted that the drafter \u201cpointedly protected itself by preserving its constitutional right of access to the judicial system while at the same time completely removed that right\u201d from the other party. <em>Iwen, </em>\u00b6 31.

We pointed out that, under the terms of the arbitration agreement, \u201cOssello is obligated to arbitrate all controversies arising from the breach of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>[agreement], but if Ossello breaches the agreement, Global has the right to sue her in a court of law and to recover damages plus court costs, collection fees, and attorney fees.\u201d <em>Ossello, </em>\u00b6 37. We therefore concluded that \u201cthe obligation to arbitrate is one-sided\u201d and \u201cnot mutual.\u201d <em>Ossello, </em>\u00b6 37.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-4\">\u00b636 We cannot conclude here that the Employment Agreement\u2019s arbitration clause was \u201cso one-sided and unreasonably favorable to the drafter\u201d as to be \u201cunconscionable\u201d and unenforceable. <em>Iwen, </em>\u00b6 32. Unlike in <em>Iwen </em>and <em>Ossello, </em>the Employment Agreement bound both Tedesco and HSOA equally to arbitrate any disputes that arose from Tedesco\u2019s employment. The terms of the clause were not skewed in HSOA\u2019s favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">\u00b637 Tedesco contends that he had less bargaining power than HSOA and that he had no meaningful choice but to accept the terms of the Employment Agreement as proposed by Adams. The record shows, however, that Tedesco had the opportunity to draft an employment agreement in March 2008, well before he signed HSOA\u2019s Employment Agreement. Indeed, he retained counsel to help him draft an agreement. Although Tedesco testified that he faced immediate termination if he did not sign the Employment Agreement as it was written, he did not present other evidence to support his assertion. Further, Tedesco signed a copy of HSOA\u2019s Alternative Dispute Resolution Agreement on February 22, 2008, which put him on notice\u2014before his employment with HSOA began\u2014that HSOA had a policy of arbitrating disputes. The record does not prove Tedesco\u2019s contention that he had no opportunity to negotiate the terms of the Employment Agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">\u00b638 As the District Court observed, Tedesco was an experienced businessman with valuable products to offer HSOA\u2014access to his branches and lending platform. Unlike a typical consumer transaction, it is not clear that HSOA had \u201csuperior bargaining power\u201d over Tedesco, given Tedesco\u2019s business expertise and sophistication, his employment of counsel, and his opportunity to propose an employment agreement. <em>Kortum-Managhan, </em>\u00b6 23. Because there is no clear error in the District Court\u2019s finding that the parties had relatively equal bargaining power, the court properly concluded that the Employment Agreement was not a \u201ccontract of adhesion.\u201d <em>See Kortum-Managhan, </em>\u00b6 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-7\">\u00b639 Tedesco\u2019s awareness of HSOA\u2019s arbitration policy, his opportunity to prepare an employment agreement with the assistance of counsel, and the fact that the Employment Agreement obligated both parties equally to arbitrate supports a conclusion that the Employment Agreement was \u201cwithin [Tedesco\u2019s] reasonable expectations\u201d and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>it was not \u201cunduly oppressive, unconscionable, or against public policy.\u201d <em>Graziano, </em>\u00b6 20. Because the Employment Agreement was not a \u201ccontract of adhesion\u201d and did not unreasonably favor HSOA, Tedesco has not shown that the arbitration clause was unconscionable and unenforceable. <em>See Kelker, </em>\u00b6 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-4\">\u00b640 Further, we are unpersuaded\u2014in light of the above-referenced circumstances surrounding the Employment Agreement\u2014that HSOA\u2019s failure to provide Tedesco with a copy of the applicable arbitration rules renders the entire clause unconscionable. Tedesco cites two federal district court cases from California to support his argument: <em>Totten v. Kellogg Brown &amp; Root, LLC, </em>152 F. Supp. 3d 1243 (C.D. Cal. 2016), and <em>Capili v. Finish Line, Inc., </em>116 F. Supp. 3d 1000 (N.D. Cal. 2015). These cases highlight California\u2019s differentiation between procedural and substantive unconscionability, a distinction that Montana does not recognize and Tedesco has not explained. Tedesco cites no Montana authority to support his contention that HSOA\u2019s failure to supply the rules, without more, requires a determination that the arbitration clause was unenforceable. The record supports the District Court\u2019s ruling that the parties entered into a valid agreement to arbitrate.</p>\n<p id=\"auz-dedup-1\">\u00b641  Finally, Tedesco argues that the District Court erred in referring his breach of contract and fraud claims to the Arbitrator. He asserts that these claims fall outside the purview of the arbitration clause. The arbitration clause states, \u201cAny and all disputes <em>arising under or related to the </em>[Employment] <em>Agreement </em>shall be resolved by binding arbitration.\u201d (Emphasis added). Tedesco\u2019s breach of contract claim is based upon Adams\u2019s and HSBC\u2019s alleged breach of the terms of the Employment Agreement and their unlawful termination of his employment. His fraud, constructive fraud, and fraud in the inducement claims rely on Adams\u2019s and HSBC\u2019s alleged misrepresentations in convincing Tedesco to move his branches and lending platform to HSOA, for which the Employment Agreement provided Tedesco would be compensated. These claims \u201caris[e] under or [are] related to\u201d Tedesco\u2019s Employment Agreement with HSOA. Applying the \u201cpresumption of arbitrability,\u201d we conclude that these claims fall under the purview of the arbitration clause and that the District Court properly referred them to arbitration. <em>See Kalispell Educ.

Tedesco asserts that, because the arbitrator clearly disregarded the law, the District Court abused its discretion in confirming the arbitration award.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-4\">\u00b645 Adams and HSBC respond in part that, because the arbitration clause was governed by the FAA, Tedesco was required to file his motion to vacate the arbitration award in federal district court rather than in state court.

The statute provides also that a party seeking confirmation of an arbitration award \u201cmay\u201d make an application for confirmation to the federal district court. 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 9. The FAA does not state explicitly that federal district courts shall have exclusive jurisdiction over applications to vacate, confirm, or alter arbitration awards. <em>See generally, </em>9 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1-16.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-7\">\u00b647 Adams and HSBC rely in part on our decision in <em>Bank of America, N.A. v. Dahlquist, </em>2007 MT 32, 336 Mont. 50, 152 P.3d 718. We stated, \u201c[I]t is questionable whether a state district court has venue, under the FAA, to consider a motion to confirm,\u201d given that \u201c[flederal case law is unclear as to whether \u00a7 9 [of the FAA] is permissive or restrictive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>concerning venue <em>in state courts.\u201d Dahlquist, </em>\u00b6 11 (emphasis in original).

Because we did not reach the jurisdictional issue, <em>Dahlquist </em>does not provide guidance here. Adams and HSBC also cite briefly to Dahlquist\u2019s companion case, <em>Citibank (S.D.) N.A. v. Dahlquist, </em>2007 MT 42, 336 Mont. 100, 152 P.3d 693.

Energy W.

Whether the Arbitrator Manifestly Disregarded the Law.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-7\">\u00b649 In granting summary judgment to Adams and HSBC, the Arbitrator first rejected Tedesco\u2019s claims of wrongful discharge under the WDEA and of breach of contract. The Arbitrator reasoned that the WDEA did not apply because Tedesco had failed to establish that either Adams or HSBC\u2014rather than HSOA\u2014was Tedesco\u2019s \u201cemployer\u201d for purposes of the law. The Arbitrator reasoned that, \u201c[i]n the absence of some statutory indication that the Montana legislature intended liability under the WDEA to extend beyond the traditional definition of employer, [Tedesco] fail[ed] to sustain a claim for violations of the WDEA\u201d against Adams or HSBC. The Arbitrator cited our holding in <em>Buck v. Billings Mont. Chevrolet, </em>248 Mont. 276, 287, 811 P.2d 537, 543 (1991), for the proposition that \u201c[a]ll remedies provided by the Act run against the employer. The Act does not envision lawsuits against corporate employees, officers or shareholders.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b506-8\">\u00b650 As to the breach of contract claim, the Arbitrator concluded that neither Adams nor HSBC was a party to the Employment Agreement and therefore that Tedesco\u2019s claims against them failed. The Arbitrator noted that \u201ccontract actions [ ] require privity for enforcement and claims of breach.\u201d (Citing <em>Degnan v. Exec. Homes, </em>215 Mont. 162, 168, 696 P.2d 431, 435 (1985); <em>State ex rel. Buttrey Foods v. Dist. Court of the Third Jud. Dist., </em>148 Mont. 350, 353, 420 P.2d 845, 847 (1996)).</p>\n<p id=\"a6b-dedup-0\">\u00b651 The Arbitrator found that the Employment Agreement was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>between Tedesco and HSOA and that Tedesco had not demonstrated privity with Adams and HSBC. As to Tedesco\u2019s attempt to \u201cpierce the corporate veil\u201d and hold Adams and HSBC legally accountable for HSOA\u2019s actions, the Arbitrator noted that, under state and federal case law, Tedesco had the burden to show that HSOA was the \u201calter ego\u201d of Adams or HSBC and that Adams or HSBC used HSOA as a \u201csubterfuge\u201d to commit bad acts. The Arbitrator concluded that Tedesco had presented \u201cscant\u201d evidence that Adams or HSBC had used HSOA as a \u201csubterfuge.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b507-4\">\u00b652 Bearing in mind the limited scope of a court\u2019s review in arbitration cases, <em>see Geissler, </em>285 Mont. at 415, 949 P.2d at 237, we conclude that Tedesco has not shown manifest disregard of the law. We do not review the Arbitrator\u2019s resolution of disputed facts, including the nature of Tedesco\u2019s relationships to Adams and HSBC, the identity of Tedesco\u2019s employer, or whether Tedesco met his evidentiary burden on his claims. The Arbitrator clearly was aware of the relevant governing principles of Montana law: namely, that the WDEA provides a remedy against an \u201cemployer,\u201d <em>see, e.g., </em>\u00a7 39-2-905, MCA, and that breach of contract actions require privity between the parties, <em>see State ex rel. Buttrey Foods</em>, 148 Mont. at 353, 420 P.2d at 847. Whether the Arbitrator correctly applied the law is not the issue. <em>Geissler, </em>285 Mont. at 417, 949 P.2d at 238. Tedesco has not established that the Arbitrator \u201cblatantly refused to follow\u201d the governing principles of law. <em>Paulson, </em>\u00b6 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">\u00b653 The Arbitrator also rejected Tedesco\u2019s fraud claims, concluding that they were barred by the statute of limitations. Tedesco had asserted that Adams made false statements during the employment negotiations about HSOA\u2019s capacity to handle Tedesco\u2019s lending platform and branches and about HSOA\u2019s financial soundness. The Arbitrator recognized that Montana law grants a party two years to file a claim of fraud, commencing from \u201cthe discovery by the aggrieved party of the facts constituting the fraud.\u201d Section 27-2-203, MCA. The Arbitrator determined that Tedesco discovered HSOA\u2019s fraudulent actions in 2008, more than two years before he filed suit in August 2011. Again, the factual findings underpinning this conclusion are beyond the scope of our review. The Arbitrator did not manifestly disregard the law pertaining to Tedesco\u2019s fraud claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">\u00b654 Tedesco argues further that the Arbitrator disregarded the law by unilaterally determining that the AAA\u2019s \u201cEmployment Arbitration Rules\u201d would apply to the proceedings, rather than the \u201cCommercial Mediation Rules,\u201d as stated in the arbitration clause, or the \u201cCommercial Arbitration Rules,\u201d as the District Court had determined. Indeed, the Arbitrator stated in a September 2015 scheduling order, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>\u201cThis Arbitration shall be governed by the AAA Employment Arbitration Rules.\u201d The Arbitrator reasoned in a subsequent order, \u201cIn designating the AAA [ ], the Parties submitted to the AAA\u2019s administrative determination that, regardless of the choice referenced, the dispute arose in the employment context and the Employment Arbitration Rules apply.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b508-4\">\u00b655 The Arbitrator relied on the AAA\u2019s Employment Arbitration Rules for the proposition that \u201cwhen an arbitration is filed arising in the employment context, the AAA makes an initial administration determination as to whether the dispute arises from an employer plan or an individually-negotiated employment agreement or contract.\u201d The Arbitrator determined that the dispute before it arose from an \u201cindividually-negotiated employment agreement.\u201d Under the Employment Arbitration Rules, that determination required the parties\u2014including Tedesco\u2014to pay equal portions of the arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"add-dedup-0\">\u00b656 \u201cOnce it is determined ... that the parties are obligated to submit the subject matter of the dispute to arbitration, procedural questions which grow out of the dispute and bear on its final disposition should be left to the arbitrator.\u201d <em>Mont. Pub. Emps. Ass\u2019n v. City of Bozeman, </em>2015 MT 69, \u00b6 8, 378 Mont. 337, 343 P.3d 1233 (quoting <em>John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. v. Livingston, </em>376 U.S. 543, 557, 84 S. Ct. 909, 918 (1964)). We held in <em>Montana Public Employees\u2019 Association, </em>for instance, that \u201can arbitration agreement\u2019s time limits and conditions precedent to arbitration are <em>procedures </em>that bear on arbitrability. Whether a dispute remains arbitrable despite the failure to follow these procedures is a classic question of procedural arbitrability that is for an arbitrator and not for a court to decide.\u201d <em>Mont. Pub. Emps. Ass\u2019n, </em>\u00b6 10 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">\u00b657 As we have discussed, the parties agreed to submit their dispute to arbitration through the AAA. The Arbitrator determined which set of rules was most applicable to the case at hand and then found that the Employment Agreement was \u201cindividually-negotiated\u201d rather than part of an \u201cemployer plan.\u201d These \u201cprocedural questions\u201d were within the Arbitrator\u2019s authority and are outside the scope of our review. <em>Mont. Pub. Emps. Ass\u2019n, </em>\u00b6 8. The Arbitrator\u2019s determination of which of the AAA rules would apply did not present a question for the court concerning \u201cmanifest disregard of the law.\u201d <em>Geissler, </em>285 Mont. at 416, 949 P.2d at 238. The Arbitrator\u2019s subsequent factual determination that the Employment Agreement was \u201cindividually-negotiated\u201d goes to the \u201cmerits of the controversy\u201d and was beyond the scope of judicial review. <em>Paulson, </em>\u00b6 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">\u00b658 Finally, Tedesco argues that the Arbitrator disregarded the law by permitting Adams and HSBC to commit discovery violations during <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>arbitration. Adams and HSBC responded to Tedesco\u2019s interrogatories and requests for production in February 2016, in compliance with the Arbitrator\u2019s order to do so. As Tedesco points out, however, the responses to most of the inquiries consisted of either objections to the questions or statements that neither Adams nor HSBC possessed the information requested. Adams also submitted to a deposition in February 2016. The transcript of that deposition shows that Adams provided answers to many of the questions, but also that he declined to answer many others. Tedesco contends that Adams\u2019s and HSBC\u2019s actions amounted to discovery violations.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-4\">\u00b659 These contentions, too, raise \u201cprocedural questions\u201d that arose during arbitration and fell under the purview of the Arbitrator. <em>See Mont. Pub. Emps. Ass\u2019n, </em>\u00b6 8. Further, \u201cMontana gives arbitrators broad authority and powers to determine all issues.\u201d <em>City of Livingston, </em>\u00b6 14. Management of the discovery process during arbitration is left to the determination of the Arbitrator. The record does not show that Adams and HSBC so clearly abused the discovery process that the Arbitrator\u2019s failure to take punitive action against them constituted a \u201cmanifest disregard of the law.\u201d <em>Geissler, </em>285 Mont. at 416, 949 P.2d at 238.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">\u00b660 Tedesco similarly argues that the District Court committed reversible error by failing to enforce discovery rules against Adams and HSBC.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> He alleges that Adams and HSBC repeatedly refused to respond to his interrogatories and requests for production, in violation of the District Court\u2019s discovery orders. Tedesco maintains that when Adams and HSBC eventually responded to Tedesco\u2019s discovery requests, they objected to most of Tedesco\u2019s inquiries and refused to provide substantive documents, thereby rendering their discovery responses meaningless and not in good faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">\u00b661 \u201cGenerally, it is up to the trial court to decide the proper sanction for discovery abuse. We defer to the trial court because it is in the best position to know whether the party in question has disregarded the other\u2019s rights, and is in the best position to determine which sanction is most appropriate.\u201d <em>Harrell v. Farmers Educ. Coop. Union, </em>2013 MT 367, \u00b6 61, 373 Mont. 92, 314 P.3d 920.

In a January 2012 order denying Adams\u2019s and HSBC\u2019s motion to stay discovery, the court noted the defendants\u2019 \u201cextensive delay in responding to discovery.\u201d Then, in an August 2014 order denying Tedesco\u2019s motion for default judgment due to Adams\u2019s and HSBC\u2019s alleged discovery violations, the court acknowledged that Adams and HSBC had not \u201cfollowed the procedures and deadlines as set out in Rule 37 [of the Montana Rules of Civil Procedure].\u201d The court explained in that order, however, that Tedesco had not \u201calleged or shown the requisite prejudice, other than delay of his day in Court, that would dictate this Court to use its discretionary powers to enter a default judgment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">\u00b663 Adams and HSBC argued\u2014and they maintain on appeal\u2014that their failure to comply fully with Tedesco\u2019s discovery requests was justified because those requests should have been directed at HSOA, which was in receivership with the FDIC. Adams and HSBC contend that the FDIC possessed the documents relating to Tedesco\u2019s employment with HSOA that Tedesco requested. Adams and HSBC moved for a protective order against Tedesco\u2019s discovery requests, which the court denied in July 2014. Shortly after the court denied the protective order, Adams and HSBC responded to Tedesco\u2019s interrogatories and requests for production. Tedesco maintains that the responses were inadequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">\u00b664 The record provides support for Tedesco\u2019s contention that Adams and HSBC did not fully comply with discovery rules. Yet the record also shows instances of Adams\u2019s and HSBC\u2019s compliance and suggests that their failures to fully comply with the discovery process were based on their belief that they did not possess the information that Tedesco requested. The District Court was in the \u201cbest position\u201d to determine whether Adams and HSBC had disregarded Tedesco\u2019s rights and \u201cto decide the proper sanction\u201d for any discovery abuses. <em>Harrell, </em>\u00b6 61. Tedesco alleged discovery violations under M. R. Civ. P. 37(b)(2)(A)\u2014for Adams\u2019s and HSBC\u2019s failure to obey the District Court\u2019s discovery orders\u2014and M. R. Civ. P. 37(d)(1)(A)(ii)\u2014for their failure to answer interrogatories or respond to requests for production. Under each of these rules, the District Court \u201cmay\u201d order sanctions; the rules do not require the District Court to do so. It was within the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>court\u2019s discretion to decide whether and how to sanction Adams and HSBC. <em>See Harrell, </em>\u00b6 61. We determine that the court did not abuse that discretion. <em>See Draggin\u2019Y Cattle Co., </em>\u00b6 17.</p>\n<p id=\"Adrj\">\u00b665  In addressing Tedesco\u2019s claims against Adams and HSBC, in determining which of the AAA\u2019s rules applied to the case at hand, and in managing the discovery process, the Arbitrator did not manifestly disregard the law. The District Court did not abuse its discretion in confirming the arbitration award.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">\u00b666 The District Court\u2019s order compelling arbitration and its judgment confirming the arbitration award are affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b511-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES SANDEFUR, SHEA and RICE concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b495-9\"> After Tedesco filed suit, HSOA was dissolved and placed into receivership with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). It was not a party to the arbitration and is not a party to this action on appeal. Tedesco maintains, however, that HSOA was the \u201calter ego\u201d of Adams and HSBC.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b509-7\"> Tedesco argues that the District Court\u2019s actions during discovery bear on the validity of the court\u2019s order compelling arbitration. But his discovery assertions go to the merits of the dispute and not to the validity of the arbitration clause. As such, we address them here, rather than in our discussion of the court\u2019s order compelling arbitration.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
