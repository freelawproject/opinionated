We address the following issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-5\">\n<em>Whether the District Court erred by granting summary judgment to State Farm on the grounds that the Stahls did not qualify as insureds under Kilby Butte Colony\u2019s State Farm Policy.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">\u00b62 We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-7\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b75-8\">\u00b63 On December 15, 2013, Mary Ann and Ivan Stahl were injured in an automobile accident when traveling in Saskatchewan, Canada. At the time of the accident, the Stahls were passengers in a motor vehicle owned by a Canadian Hutterite Colony. Another individual was at fault for the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-9\">\u00b64 The Stahls are members of the Kilby Butte Hutterite Colony. Kilby Butte is a Montana religious corporation with a community treasury that engages in business for the common benefit of its members. Hutterite colony members own assets of the community collectively; therefore, the Stahls cannot own a vehicle in their individual capacities. Kilby Butte owns multiple vehicles all titled and insured in the Colony\u2019s name. All of the Colony\u2019s auto insurance policies were purchased through State Farm at State Farm\u2019s agency office in Lewistown. No individual Colony members were listed as named insureds on any vehicle owned by the Colony.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-10\">\u00b65 The Colony submitted a claim to State Farm on behalf of the Stahls under its 2006 Freightliner Policy (\u201cPolicy\u201d) that provided underinsured motorist coverage (\u201cUIM Coverage\u201d) in the amount of $50,000 per person and $100,000 per accident. State Farm declined the Stahls\u2019 claim because the Stahls were not occupying the Freightliner at the time of their accident and did not meet the definition of \u201cinsured\u201d under the Policy. The declaration page for the Policy listed the named insured as \u201cKilby Butte Colony.\u201d The UIM Coverage is detailed in Policy Form 9826A \u201cState Farm Car Policy Booklet\u201d as follows (emphasis in the original):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-11\">Insuring Agreement</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-12\"><em>We </em>will pay compensatory damages for <em>bodily injury </em>an <em>insured </em>is legally entitled to recover from the owner or driver of an <em>underinsured motor vehicle. </em>The bodily injury must be:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>1. sustained by an <em>insured', </em>and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-4\">2. caused by an accident that involves the operation, maintenance, or use of an <em>underinsured motor vehicle </em>as a motor vehicle.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">Policy Form 9826A defines \u201cinsured\u201d as follows in regards to UIM Coverage (emphasis in the original):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-6\"><em>Insured </em>means:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-7\">1 <em>you,</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-8\">2. <em>resident relatives',</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-9\">3. any other <em>person </em>who is not insured for underinsured motor vehicle coverage under another vehicle policy and only while that <em>person </em>is <em>occupying </em>a car:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-10\">a. that is used within the scope of <em>your </em>consent;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-11\">b. the ownership, maintenance, or use of which is provided liability coverage by one of the <em>State Farm </em>Companies; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-12\">c. that is either:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-13\">(1) <em>owned by:</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-14\">(a) the first <em>person </em>shown as a named insured on the Declarations Page or that named insured\u2019s spouse who resides primarily with that named insured; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-15\">(b) any <em>resident relative', </em>or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-16\">(2) a <em>temporary substitute car.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-17\">Such other <em>person occupying </em>a vehicle used to carry <em>persons </em>for a charge is not an <em>insured', </em>and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-18\">4. any <em>person </em>who has not sustained a <em>bodily injury </em>but is entitled to recover compensatory damages as a result of <em>bodily injury </em>to an <em>insured </em>as defined in 1., 2., or 3. above.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b76-19\">Policy Form 6926A.2 \u201cAmendatory Endorsement\u201d amends the definition of \u201cinsured\u201d in regards to UIM Coverage as follows (emphasis in the original):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-20\">6.

The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment, and the District Court held oral arguments on April 23, 2015. On March 1, 2017, the District Court granted State Farm\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment, denied the Colony\u2019s Motion, and determined that the Stahls did not qualify for UIM Coverage because the Stahls did not satisfy the definition of an \u201cInsured\u201d within the terms of the policy. Relying on <em>Hanson v. Emp\u2019rs Mut. Cas. Co., </em>336 F.Supp.2d 1070 (D. Mont. 2004), <em>Am. States Ins. Co. v. Flathead Janitorial &amp; Rug </em>Servs., 2015 MT 239, 380 Mont. 308, 355 P.3d 735, <em>and Stonehocker v. Gulf Ins. Co., </em>2016 MT 78, 383 Mont. 140, 368 P.3d 1187, the District Court held that \u201cso long as an insurance policy is unambiguous, a claimant must satisfy the policy definition of an insured in order to qualify for UIM Coverage. It is not a violation of a claimant\u2019s reasonable expectations for a corporate insurance policy to restrict the class of insureds for which its policy provides coverage.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b78-15\">STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b78-16\">\u00b67 We review a district court\u2019s entry of summary judgment de novo. <em>Stonehocker, </em>\u00b6 9 (citing <em>McClue v. Safeco Ins. Co., </em>2015 MT 222, \u00b6 8, 380 Mont. 204, 354 P.3d 604). \u201cSummary judgment is appropriate when the moving party demonstrates both the absence of any genuine issues of material fact and entitlement to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Stonehocker, </em>\u00b6 9 (citing M. R. Civ. P. 56). When there are cross-motions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>for summary judgment, a district court must evaluate each party\u2019s motion on its own merits. <em>Halenga v. Schwein, </em>2007 MT 80, \u00b6 18, 336 Mont. 507, 155 P.3d 1242. On cross-motions for summary judgment, where the district court is not called to resolve factual disputes and only draw conclusions of law, we review the district court\u2019s conclusions of law to determine whether they are correct. <em>Bud-Kal v. City of Kalispell, </em>2009 MT 93, \u00b6 15, 350 Mont. 25, 204 P.3d 738.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-4\">\u00b68 The interpretation of an insurance contract is a question of law that we review de novo to determine whether the district court is correct. <em>Stonehocker, </em>\u00b6 10 (citing <em>Tidyman\u2019s Mgmt. Servs. v. Davis, </em>2014 MT 205, \u00b6 13, 376 Mont. 80, 330 P.3d 1139).</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">\u00b69 <em>Whether the District Court erred by granting summary judgment to State Farm on the grounds that the Stahls did not qualify as \u201cinsureds\u201d under Kilby Butte Colony\u2019s State Farm Policy.</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-7\">\u00b610 We use the following approach to interpret insurance contracts: General rules of contract law apply to insurance policies and we construe them strictly against the insurer and in favor of the insured. Courts give the terms and words used in an insurance contract their usual meaning and construe them using common sense. Any ambiguity in an insurance policy must be construed in favor of the insured and in favor of extending coverage. An ambiguity exists where the contract, when taken as a whole, reasonably is subject to two different interpretations. Courts should not, however, seize upon certain and definite covenants expressed in plain English with violent hands, and distort them so as to include a risk clearly excluded by the insurance contract.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Abc\"><em>Mecca v. Farmers Ins. Exch., </em>2005 MT 260, \u00b6 9, 329 Mont. 73, 122 P.3d 1190 (quoting <em>Travelers Cas. and Sur. Co. v. Ribi Immunochem Research, Inc., </em>2005 MT 50, \u00b6 17, 326 Mont. 174, 108 P.3d 469). We read insurance policies as a whole and reconcile the policy\u2019s various parts to give each part meaning and effect. Section 33-15-316, MCA; <em>Newbury v. State Farm Fire &amp; Cas. Co. of Bloomington, Ill., </em>2008 MT 156, \u00b6 19, 343 Mont. 279, 184 P.3d 1021. We recognize the reasonable expectations doctrine and have consistently held that the objectively reasonable expectations of insurance purchasers regarding their policy terms should be honored, even if a painstaking study of the policy negates expectations. When applying the doctrine, an insurance contract is to be interpreted from the viewpoint of a consumer with average intelligence, with no training in the law or insurance. <em>Flathead Janitorial, </em>\u00b6 22 (citing <em>Leibrand v. Nat\u2019l Farmers Union </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number><em>Prop. &amp; Cas. Co., </em>272 Mont. 1, 7, 898 P.2d 1220, 1224 (1995)).</p>\n<p id=\"b80-4\">\u00b611 Simply because a party claims a contract provision is ambiguous or disagrees with the meaning of a provision does not make it so. <em>Giacomelli v. Scottsdale Ins. Co., </em>2009 MT 418, \u00b6 32, 354 Mont. 15, 221 P.3d 666. Courts will not distort the language of a contract provision to create an ambiguity that does not exist. <em>Giacomelli, </em>\u00b6 32.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">\u00b612 The Colony contends that the Policy and its endorsements limit UIM Coverage to injured persons who both own and occupy an insured motor vehicle. The Colony argues that individual Colony members can never qualify for UIM Coverage because Colony members cannot own Colony motor vehicles. Thus, the Colony contends the Policy\u2019s UIM Coverage is illusory. The Colony asserts the Stahls are entitled to the UIM Coverage based on public policy considerations espoused in <em>Chaffee v. U.S. Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Co., </em>181 Mont. 1, 591 P.2d 1102 (1979), and <em>Bennett v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., </em>261 Mont. 386, 389, 862 P.2d 1146, 1148 (1993) (\u201cThe public policy embodied in these decisions is that an insurer may not place in an insurance policy a provision that defeats coverage for which the insurer has received valuable consideration.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">\u00b613 The Colony maintains UIM Coverage is \u201cpersonal and portable\u201d and is provided even if the UIM claimant is not occupying an insured vehicle. <em>See Mitchell v. State Farm Ins. Co., </em>2003 MT 102, \u00b6 40, 315 Mont. 281, 68 P.3d 703. An exception to this rule, however, exists for corporate or business auto insurance policies that require occupancy of the corporate owned vehicle as a condition of coverage. The problem with this exception as applied to this case, the Colony argues, is that most individuals can purchase UIM Coverage for themselves through their personal auto insurance policies. <em>See Stonehocker, </em>\u00b6 17; <em>Flathead Janitorial, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 18, 23; <em>Chilberg v. Rose, </em>273 Mont. 414, 903 P.2d 1377 (1995). Because Colony members, like the Stahls, cannot purchase personal UIM Coverage, the Colony contends the Policy\u2019s UIM Coverage remains illusory for individual Colony members.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-7\">\u00b614 State Farm responds that the Stahls do not satisfy the Policy definition of \u201cinsured\u201d because they were not occupying a vehicle that satisfies the Policy definition of \u201cyour car,\u201d a \u201cnewly acquired car,\u201d or a \u201ctemporary substitute car\u201d at the time of their accident. State Farm contends that corporate policies, such as the Colony\u2019s, may restrict the class of beneficiaries for which UIM Coverage is provided to individuals occupying covered vehicles. <em>See Stonehocker, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 15-17; <em>Flathead Janitorial, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 18, <em>23; Hanson, </em>336 F.Supp.2d at 1076. State Farm also contends this restriction is not a violation of the Colony\u2019s reasonable expectations under the plain language of the Policy. <em>See Flathead </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number><em>Janitorial, </em>\u00b6 22. Because the Stahls would be entitled to recover UIM Coverage had they been occupying a vehicle that satisfies the Policy definition of \u201cyour car,\u201d a \u201cnewly acquired car,\u201d or a \u201ctemporary substitute car\u201d at the time of the accident, State Farm argues the Policy does not provide illusory coverage. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"Af0\">\u00b615  The Stahls do not satisfy any definition of \u201cinsured\u201d under the Policy. Nor were the Stahls occupying a covered vehicle at the time of the accident. The Stahls would qualify for UIM coverage under the Policy if they were occupying a Colony covered vehicle at the time of the accident; thus, the Policy is not illusory, as the Colony claims. The requirement that a Colony member occupy a covered vehicle to obtain UIM Coverage is not a violation of its reasonable expectations of the Policy terms, even when interpreting the Policy from the Colony\u2019s viewpoint. <em>Flathead Janitorial, </em>\u00b6 22. The Policy is a business or corporate policy, and \u201cas long as it is legal for an insurer to sell an automobile liability policy to a corporation, which is the named insured, it is legal for the insurer to limit the class of covered individuals to those who are occupying covered vehicles at the time they are injured.\u201d <em>Hanson, </em>336 F.Supp.2d at 1076. \u201cWe have not expanded coverage to injured persons involved in the corporation who are not occupying vehicles covered under the policy at the time of the accident.\u201d <em>Stonehocker, </em>\u00b6 17 (quoting Lee <em>v. Great Divide Ins. Co., </em>2008 MT 80, \u00b6 16, 342 Mont. 147, 182 P.3d 41). UIM Coverage is not so personal and portable that insurers are required to sell UIM Coverage irrespective of an auto insurance policy. <em>Hanson, </em>336 F.Supp.2d at 1076.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"APS\">\u00b616  The Colony contracted with State Farm for UIM Coverage to insure occupants of its covered vehicles. The fact that the Stahls do not meet the definition of \u201cinsured\u201d because they were not in a covered vehicle at the time of their accident does not defeat coverage and render any coverage State Farm promised to provide illusory. <em>See Newbury, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 20, 27. The District Court did not err in finding the Stahls do not satisfy the unambiguous definition of \u201cinsured\u201d under UIM Coverage in the Policy and that they are not entitled to those benefits. The District Court was correct in determining the Policy did not provide illusory coverage. We affirm the District Court\u2019s order granting State Farm\u2019s motion for summary judgment and denying the Colony\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<judges id=\"b81-7\">JUSTICES WHEAT, SANDEFUR, BAKER and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
