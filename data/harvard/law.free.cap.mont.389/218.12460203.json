McAtee brokered a construction loan, which the borrowers defaulted on in 2008. McAtee was included on the loan as a personal guarantor, and TMS held a trust indenture on the property and assigned its interest in the trust indenture to WCU. The assignment was not recorded. Subsequently, WCU, through its attorneys, Morrison and Frampton, PLLP (M&amp;F), filed suit against TMS to foreclose on the defaulted loan. WCU alleged that when the borrowers defaulted, the construction was unfinished; McAtee then borrowed money from a friend to finish it, and put his interest as first priority secured mortgage. WCU alleged McAtee pledged WCU\u2019s collateral rather than TMS\u2019s collateral as security for the mortgage to the new lender, leaving WCU with an unsecured loan. WCU alleged fraud in the foreclosure by McAtee. These allegations led to criminal fraud charges against McAtee. The District Court determined that the new lender was a bona fide purchaser for value, so WCU no longer had a secured interest. Ultimately, both the criminal and civil fraud claims were dismissed. WCU alleges it dismissed all of its claims against McAtee when she went through bankruptcy.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-11\">\u00b64 In September 2014, prior to the resolution of these claims, McAtee filed a motion for leave to amend her answer in the WCU foreclosure case to add M&amp;F as a party to the action and to assert claims for malicious prosecution and abuse of process. In December 2014, the District Court denied McAtee\u2019s motion to amend her answer in the WCU complaint, reasoning the parties had been litigating for over three years, sufficient time for McAtee to \u201cclarify and solidify\u201d her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>allegations.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">\u00b65 McAtee filed the instant case, as a separate action against WCU and M&amp;F, for abuse of process and malicious prosecution. On January 30, 2015, McAtee amended this complaint. On March 5, 2015, WCU and M&amp;F filed a M. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss; the defendants included considerable materials from the underlying foreclosure case and requested the judge to convert the motions to motions for summary judgment if necessary. On December 20, 2016, the District Court granted the M. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss the McAtee complaint with prejudice, concluding that \u201cthe filing of this cause of action constitutes improper serial litigation of a claim,\u201d that the suit is based upon the same facts and transactions as those alleged in the foreclosure litigation, and that it is therefore impermissible under \u00a7 3-1-502, MCA. McAtee appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b246-7\">\u00b66 We review de novo a district court\u2019s ruling on a motion to dismiss pursuant to M. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). <em>Western Sec. Bank v. Eide Bailly LLP, </em>2010 MT 291, \u00b6 18, 359 Mont. 34, 249 P.3d 35.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b246-9\">\u00b67 <em>Did the District Court err in granting defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss McAtee\u2019s amended complaint when it found that the action constituted improper serial litigation pursuant to \u00a7 3-1-502, MCA?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b246-10\">\u00b68 McAtee argues the District Court incorrectly dismissed her complaint when it found her action constituted improper serial litigation. WCU agrees that the District Court\u2019s dismissal of McAtee\u2019s complaint based on \u00a7 3-1-502, MCA, is legally incorrect. However, it asserts the District Court reached the correct result and urges this Court to uphold the dismissal. The District Court dismissed McAtee\u2019s complaint because she was first \u201cdenied the opportunity to add a defendant and two causes of action [to the underlying foreclosure litigation], so she filed this action.\u201d The District Court found her pleadings to be impermissible, concluding that \u00a7 3-1-502, MCA, barred her complaint, <em>citing In re Stewart, </em>163 Mont. 432, 517 P.2d 879 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"A8UA\">\u00b69 Section 3-1-502(1), MCA states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-11\">If an application for an order, made to a judge of a court in which the action or proceeding is pending, is refused in whole or in part or is granted conditionally, no subsequent application for the same order shall be made to any other judge, except of a higher court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ACYY\">Pursuant to the statute, when a judge denies a request for an order a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>party may not seek \u201cthe same order\u201d from another judge. In <em>Stewart, </em>an incapacitated person, Gavin, filed a petition for restoration to capacity, which the district court denied. <em>Stewart, </em>163 Mont. at 433, 517 P.2d at 879. After a new judge was appointed to the case, Gavin\u2019s counsel filed another petition for restoration to capacity. The new judge ordered Gavin to restored capacity. Based on an application for writ of supervisory control, this Court determined the petitions were the same and the second petition should have been denied. <em>Stewart, </em>163 Mont. at 433-34, 517 P.2d at 880.</p>\n<p id=\"aei-dedup-2\">\u00b610  Unlike <em>Stewart, </em>McAtee did not attempt to obtain different results by seeking the same order from another judge. McAtee filed a motion to amend and commenced a separate proceeding through the filing of a new complaint. Section 3-1-502, MCA, \u201cforbids only a subsequent application for the same order to any other judge.\u201d <em>Marvel Brute Steel Bldg. v. Bass, </em>189 Mont. 480, 483, 616 P.2d 380, 382 (1980). McAtee has not asked any judge for \u201cthe same order\u201d to allow the amended pleading. McAtee has instead filed this separate action asserting her malicious prosecution claims, which accrued after WCU filed its action. Section 3-1-502, MCA, does not bar McAtee\u2019s original complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">\u00b611 WCU agrees \u00a7 3-1-502,MCA, does not bar McAtee\u2019s complaintbut urges this Court to uphold the dismissal on other grounds. Although the District Court did not address any of the arguments advanced by the parties, its order granting the motions to dismiss cannot be affirmed on other grounds. The District Court did not convert the M. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) motions into motions for summary judgment, never gave McAtee notice that it would do so, and McAtee was never afforded the opportunity for a hearing. <em>See Meagher v. Butte-Silver Bow City-County, </em>2007 MT 129, \u00b6\u00b6 16-17, 337 Mont. 339, 160 P.3d 552; <em>Cole v. Flathead County, </em>236 Mont. 412, 418-19, 771 P.2d 97. Therefore, despite WCU and M&amp;F\u2019s extensive factual arguments, their M. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) motions had the effect of \u201cadmitting all well-pleaded allegations in the <em>complaint.\u201d Reidelbach v. Burlington N. and Santa Fe Ry. Co., </em>2002 MT 289, \u00b6 14, 312 Mont. 498, 60 P.3d 418. McAtee\u2019s complaint properly alleges every element of her claims under Montana law. We will not consider in the first instance the merits of WCU\u2019s and M&amp;F\u2019s substantive grounds for judgment in their favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"AIiX\">\u00b612  The District Court incorrectly dismissed McAtee\u2019s petition based on \u00a7 3-1-502, MCA. McAtee\u2019s original complaint is not improper <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>serial litigation and therefore is not barred. We decline to address the alternative grounds proffered by WCU and M&amp;F to uphold the District Court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">\u00b613 Reversed and remanded for further proceedings consistent with this Opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b248-6\">JUSTICES McKINNON, BAKER, SHEA and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
