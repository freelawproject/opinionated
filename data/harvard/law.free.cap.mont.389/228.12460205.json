Finding the issue stated below dispositive we decline to address the additional issues raised by the parties. We reverse and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-10\">\u00b62 We restate the issue on appeal as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-11\">\n<em>Whether the District Court abused its discretion by granting New West leave to amend its answer to assert ERISA preemption.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b255-12\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b255-13\">\u00b63 Dana Rolan (Rolan) was injured in a vehicular collision on November 16,2007, and sustained serious injury, resulting in medical expenses totaling approximately $120,000. Rolan carried health insurance through New West. The tortfeasor who caused the accident carried liability insurance through Unitrin Services Group (Unitrin). Unitrin accepted legal responsibility and paid approximately $100,000 of Rolan\u2019s medical bills.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-14\">\u00b64 On January 26, 2010, Rolan filed a complaint against New West alleging individual and class claims for breach of contract, violation of made-whole rights, and unfair claims settlement practices under \u00a7\u00a7 33-18-201, MCA, et seq. Rolan sought compensatory and punitive damages. During a deposition, New West\u2019s representative affirmatively stated that Rolan\u2019s plan was \u201cnot a properly constituted ERISA plan.\u201d Relying on such representation, Rolan proceeded with her claims and class claims based solely on state law.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-15\">\u00b65 Rolan sought to certify a class under M. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2) for declaratory and injunctive relief arising from the claims for breach of contract and violation of made-whole rights. Rolan\u2019s class certification was based on the systematic practices by New West to avoid paying medical bills for an insured when a liability carrier was available to pay medical bills as part of tort damages. On April 25, 2012, the District Court granted class certification. Maintaining that Rolan\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>claims were based solely on state law claims, New West proceeded to appeal to this Court Rolan\u2019s class certification. We upheld the class certification in <em>Rolan v. New West Health Servs., </em>2013 MT 220, 371 Mont. 228, 307 P.3d 291.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">\u00b66 On October 24, 2013, New West moved to amend its answer alleging the policy was an Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) policy and that all state law claims were preempted by federal law. Rolan opposed New West\u2019s motion to amend. The District Court allowed New West to amend its answer to include the affirmative defense of ERISA preemption. The District Court reasoned, \u201c[i]f federal law does in fact preempt state law resolution of this case, the ends of justice would not be served by denying the motion to amend.\u201d The District Court granted Rolan attorney fees for time spent addressing New West\u2019s abandoned defenses. Following the District Court\u2019s order allowing New West to amend, New West moved for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">\u00b67 On May 6,2015, the District Court granted New West\u2019s motion for summary judgment holding that Rolan\u2019s policy was subject to ERISA and thus her original state law claims were preempted. However, the District Court allowed Rolan to amend her complaint to include ERISA claims. On June 1,2015, Rolan amended her complaint to include both state law and ERISA claims. New West then removed the case to federal court.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-7\">\u00b68 On February 29, 2016, the federal court remanded the case back to state court. The federal court determined that New West\u2019s removal was untimely. Judge Lovell cited several causes for the delay in removal; one cause was: \u201cNew West\u2019s inexplicable confusion over whether its own plan was or was not an ERISA plan.\u201d Nevertheless, the federal court concluded that the state court had concurrent jurisdiction over Rolan\u2019s ERISA 502(a)(1) claims and therefore Rolan may proceed with her ERISA claims in state court.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-8\">\u00b69 Following remand, Rolan filed a motion requesting the District Court to resolve all matters regarding ERISA preemption. New West moved for summary judgment asserting ERISA preemption requires dismissal of Rolan\u2019s state law and ERISA claims. On December 7, 2016, the District Court granted New West\u2019s motion for summary judgment and denied Rolan\u2019s motion. The District Court again dismissed Rolan\u2019s argument that New West waived the affirmative defense of ERISA preemption. Further, the District Court determined that complete preemption under \u00a7 502 of ERISA was proper and thus barred any state law claims asserted by Rolan.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b257-4\">\u00b610 We review the district court\u2019s decision to amend for an abuse of discretion. <em>Lindey\u2019s v. Professional Consultants, </em>244 Mont. 238, 242, 797 P.2d 920, 923 (1990). \u201cA district court abuses its discretion when it acts arbitrarily, without employment of conscientious judgment, or in excess of the bounds of reason resulting in substantial injustice.\u201d <em>Kershaw v. Mont. Dept. of Transp., </em>2011 MT 170, \u00b6 11, 361 Mont. 215, 257 P.3d 358 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">\u00b611 <em>Whether the District Court abused its discretion by granting New West leave to amend its answer to assert ERISA preemption.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b257-7\">\u00b612 Rolan argues on appeal that the District Court abused its discretion in granting New West\u2019s motion to amend its answer. Specifically, Rolan maintains that ERISA preemption is an affirmative defense and should have been pled in the answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-8\">\u00b613 New West counters that the District Court did not err by allowing leave to amend because leave should be freely given \u201cwhen justice so requires.\u201d M. R. Civ. P. 15(a)(2). New West contends that there was no evidence of bad faith, intentional delay, or dilatory motive by New West; therefore, leave to amend was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-9\">\u00b614 Montana Rule of Civil Procedure 8(c) provides that \u201c[i]n responding to a pleading, a party must affirmatively state any avoidance or affirmative defense.\u201d The rationale for requiring these defenses be affirmatively pled are the underlying principles of fairness and notice. <em>Weaver v. State, </em>2013 MT 247, \u00b6 35, 371 Mont. 476, 310 P.3d 495. We have previously held that ERISA preemption is an affirmative defense and thus is waivable if not timely raised pursuant to M. R. Civ. P. 8(c). <em>Winslow v. Mont. Rail Link, Inc., </em>2005 MT 217, \u00b6\u00b6 37-38, 328 Mont. 260, 121 P.3d <em>506; Rimrock Chrysler, Inc., v. DOJ, </em>2016 MT 165, \u00b6 29, 384 Mont. 76, 375 P.3d 392 (citing <em>Wolf v. Reliance Std. Life Ins., </em>71 F.3d 444, 449 (1st Cir. 1995)). However, Rule 8(c) is not absolute; a district court may allow a defendant to amend its answer to include an affirmative defense pursuant to M. R. Civ. P. 15. <em>Keller v. Dooling, </em>248 Mont. 535, 542, 813 P.2d 437, 441 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b257-10\">\u00b615 Montana Rules of Civil Procedure 15(a) provides \u201ca party may amend its pleading only with the opposing party\u2019s written consent or court\u2019s leave. The court should freely give leave when justice so requires.\u201d However, \u201cthis does not mean that a court must automatically grant a motion to amend.\u201d <em>Kershaw, </em>\u00b6 25. We have articulated circumstances justifying a court\u2019s denial of a motion to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>amend. Such situations include when the denial is \u201cfor an apparent reason such as undue delay, bad faith or dilatory motive on the part of the movant, repeated failure to cure deficiencies by amendments previously allowed, undue prejudice to the opposing party by allowance of the amendment, futility of the amendment, etc.\u201d <em>Bitterroot Int\u2019l Sys. v. Western Star Trucks, Inc., </em>2007 MT 48, \u00b6 50, 336 Mont. 145, 153 P.3d 627 (quoting <em>Lindey\u2019s, </em>244 Mont. 238, 242, 797 P.2d 920, 923).</p>\n<p id=\"adj-dedup-0\">\u00b616 In determining whether an amendment would cause undue prejudice, a court should balance the prejudice suffered by the opposing party \u201cagainst the sufficiency of the moving party\u2019s justification of the delay.\u201d <em>Farmers Coop. Ass\u2019n v. Amsden, LLC, </em>2007 MT 286, \u00b6 14, 339 Mont. 445, 171 P.3d 690. We previously have concluded undue prejudice exists when the opposing party already had expended \u201csubstantial effort and expense\u201d in the course of the dispute that \u201cwould be wasted\u201d if the moving party were allowed to proceed on a new legal theory. <em>Eagle Ridge Ranch v. Park County, </em>283 Mont. 62, 68-69, 938 P.2d 1342, 1346 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">\u00b617 Initially, the District Court failed to conduct an inquiry into whether Rolan and the class she represents would be prejudiced. The District Court failed to determine if undue delay, bad faith or dilatory motive on the part of the movant, repeated failure to cure deficiencies by amendments previously allowed, undue prejudice to the opposing party by allowance of the amendment, or futility of the amendment existed. The District Court\u2019s reasoning was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-6\">\u201c[t]he Court is sensitive to Rolan\u2019s arguments regarding the effects of allowing amendment at this stage. However, the briefing before the Court does not directly address the question of whether ERISA in fact preempts federal law. If federal law does in fact preempt state law resolution of this case, the ends of justice would not be served by denying the motion to amend.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b258-7\">Clearly, the District Court allowed amendment purely because the defense would apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-8\">\u00b618 We have upheld a District Court\u2019s denial to amend to include an affirmative defense, even if such defense could apply. <em>See, e.g., Bitterroot, </em>\u00b6 54; <em>Cullen v. Western Mortgage &amp; Warranty Title Co., </em>47 Mont. 513, 530, 134 P. 302, 307 (1913); <em>Meadow Lake Estates Homeowners Ass\u2019n v. Shoemaker, </em>2008 MT 41, \u00b6\u00b6 30-31, 341 Mont. 345, 178 P.3d 81; Peuse <em>v. Malkuch, </em>275 Mont. 221, 228, 911 P.2d 1153, 1157 (1996). If we allowed amending an answer any time an affirmative defense applied it would effectively eliminate M. R. Civ. P. 8(c). A district court should freely allow a party to amend its pleadings; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>however, leave to amend should not be automatically given. Thus, the District Court should have inquired as to whether Rolan would suffer prejudice from the amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">\u00b619 We have upheld a district court\u2019s denial of motion for leave to amend if extraordinary circumstances are present. In <em>Peuse, </em>we recognized that a party\u2019s prolonged delay in adopting a new legal theory is prejudicial to the opposing party, particularly when a party waits until after the opposing party files a motion for summary judgment. <em>Peuse, </em>275 Mont. at 228, 911 P.2d at 1157. In affirming the district court\u2019s denial of the defendants\u2019 motion, we noted the two-year delay and explained that if the district court were to have granted the defendants\u2019 motion, the plaintiff would have been \u201cprejudiced since his [summary judgment] motion was based on the original pleadings which remained unchanged for almost two years.\u201d <em>Peuse, </em>275 Mont. at 227, 911 P.2d at 1157. Further, we noted that new counsel does not excuse an inopportune request for amendment when those defenses were available to original counsel. <em>Peuse, </em>275 Mont. at 227, 911 P.2d at 1156. We concluded that \u201c|1 litigants should be allowed to change legal theories after a motion for summary judgment has been filed only in extraordinary cases <em>.\u2019\u2019 Peuse, </em>275 Mont. at 228, 911 P.2d at 1157.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">\u00b620 We later affirmed <em>Peuse </em>in <em>Bitterroot Int\u2019l Sys. v. Western Star Trucks, Inc., </em>\u00b6\u00b6-52-54. We recognized that a district court should balance the alleged prejudice to the opposing party against the rationale of the party seeking leave to amend. We noted that Western Star\u2019s oversight justification in seeking leave to amend did not outweigh Bitterroot\u2019s prejudice against the amendment which would have occurred after a five-year delay, the close of discovery, and within three months of trial. <em>Bitterroot, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 51-53. Further, Western Star attempted to minimize its oversight by stating that Bitterroot should have known such a defense was likely. We were unpersuaded, stating, \u201cWestern\u2019s counsel fails to explain adequately, however, how such an obvious defense escaped its attention for nearly five years.\u201d <em>Bitterroot, </em>\u00b6 53. In concluding the district court properly denied Western Star\u2019s motion to amend, we determined that allowing Western Star to amend under these circumstances \u201cwould render Rule 8(c)\u2019s purpose of providing adequate notice of affirmative defenses to the plaintiff a nullity.\u201d <em>Bitterroot, </em>\u00b6 54.</p>\n<p id=\"A21\">\u00b621  There are no extraordinary circumstances in this case that would warrant granting New West\u2019s motion to amend. Rolan and the class argued that they would be substantially prejudiced by allowing New West to amend its answer to include the affirmative defense of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>ERISA preemption. Rolan and the class cite to three specific reasons prejudice would occur: (1) the length of the delay, (2) the parties have conducted extensive discovery, and (3) the case has already been appealed to the Montana Supreme Court for class certification based on state law claims. Conversely, New West has not offered any reasonable justification for the delay. New West has not sufficiently explained why it failed to assert ERISA preemption in its original answer, why its own representative in a deposition substantiated that ERISA did not apply, or why it proceeded based upon state law claims for nearly three and a half years. The facts of this case are akin to <em>Peuse </em>and <em>Bitterroot, </em>in which we affirmed the district courts\u2019 denial of leave to amend. Nevertheless, the District Court determined that New West should be able to amend its pleading.</p>\n<p id=\"A_qb\">\u00b622  Although length of delay and stage of the proceedings are crucial factors, alone they may not warrant denying the amendment. However, had the District Court conducted a proper inquiry into undue prejudice, we conclude the class certification would have been the dispositive issue. Rolan and the class were certified as a class based only on state law claims. Allowing New West to amend to include ERISA preemption would effectively destroy the class. As a class, they shared a common question of law or fact. Specifically, Rolan and her class alleged New West had systematically violated their state law made-whole rights. New West\u2019s amendment could de-certify the class, forcing Rolan and the class to either seek re-certification based on ERISA claims or proceed alone, ten years after Rolan\u2019s injury and more than seven years after she filed suit. The District Court failed to consider the effect of the amendment on the class. We conclude that Rolan and the class she represents would be unduly prejudiced by allowing New West to amend.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">\u00b623 Rolan and the class she represents already had expended substantial effort and expense, including an appeal to this Court in the course of the dispute, that was wasted when New West was allowed to proceed on a new legal theory. Therefore, Rolan\u2019s showing of undue prejudice to her and the class combined with the New West\u2019s failure to reasonably justify the delay should have led the District Court to deny leave to amend.</p>\n<p id=\"AGHT\">\u00b624  Thus, we conclude the District Court exceeded the bounds of reason resulting in substantial injustice to Rolan. We recognize that district courts should freely grant leave to amend; however, based on the District Court\u2019s inadequate inquiry and the extraordinary circumstances of this case, we conclude that the District Court abused its discretion by granting New West leave to amend.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>\u00b625 Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b261-5\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES SHEA, BAKER, SANDEFUR and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b261-6\">JUSTICE McKINNON,</author>\n<p id=\"ANm\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-7\">\u00b626 I dissent from the Court\u2019s conclusion that the District Court \u201cexceeded the bounds of reason resulting in substantial injustice to Rolan\u201d when it allowed New West leave to amend its answer to assert federal preemption. Opinion, \u00b6 24. We have repeatedly held that leave to amend should be freely granted when justice requires unless the moving party is guilty of undue delay, bad faith, or a dilatory motive. <em>Aldrich &amp; Co. v. Ellis, </em>2002 MT 177, \u00b6 27, 311 Mont. 1, 52 P.3d 388. There was no evidence of intentional delay, bad faith, or a dilatory motive on the part of New West. Further, the District Court took efforts to alleviate any prejudice to Rolan as a result of the amendment. Here, the District Court concluded that the \u201cends of justice would not be served by denying the motion to amend.\u201d The District Court recognized that the application of state subrogation statutes and doctrine to federal ERISA benefit plans was incorrect as a matter of law. The court appreciated that applying the wrong law to the parties\u2019 disputes would not advance proper resolution of their underlying claims nor further the ends of justice. Clearly, the District Court believed those considerations deserved more weight in the analysis and that New West\u2019s leave to amend should prevail over Rolan\u2019s objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-8\">\u00b627 The District Court was in a very difficult position, as clearly factors weighed in favor of both granting and denying leave to amend. I do not think it as clear and one-sided as the Court opines and, under the present circumstances, the rule of deference to the trial court should prevail. Accordingly, I dissent from the Court\u2019s decision finding the District Court abused its discretion by granting New West leave to amend. I would address the merits of the controversy.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
