We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-9\">\u00b62 We restate the issue on appeal as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-10\">\n<em>Whether the District Court erred in granting a judgment as a matter of law in favor of St. Peter\u2019s Hospital following a jury verdict in favor of Eric Horn.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b476-11\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b476-12\">\u00b63 Horn was injured in April 2011 when he fell from a roof, fracturing his heels and a vertebra. His injuries required several surgeries, a seventeen-day stay in the Hospital, and a subsequent period of immobilization. Prior to surgery, Hospital orthopedic surgeon Dr. Jeffrey Martin ordered that a retrievable blood clot filter be placed in Horn\u2019s inferior vena cava (IVC), a large vein leading to the heart. The purpose of installing the filter was to trap blood clots that might arise from the period of physical inactivity during Horn\u2019s recuperation after surgery. A radiologist employed by Great Divide Radiology implanted an Optease brand filter.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-13\">\u00b64 Dr. Martin was the primary physician responsible for Horn\u2019s care from April 28,2011, to August 16,2011. In early August 2011, after the filter had been in place about 120 days and Horn had regained some mobility, Dr. Martin ordered that it be removed. On August 16, 2011, Dr. Jeffrey Georgia attempted to remove the filter, but discovered that it was embedded in the wall of Horn\u2019s IVC and could not be retrieved.</p>\n<p id=\"AEYl\">\u00b65 After the failed filter retrieval, Horn returned to the Hospital\u2019s emergency room several times with severe abdominal, pelvic and groin pains. He was treated for a bladder or kidney infection, but in August 2011 returned to the ER with a swollen right leg. Horn was transported to St. Patrick Hospital in Missoula on August 29 and remained there through September 2,2011. Doctors there treated Horn for a blood clot and hematoma, and inserted a stent in his left iliac vein.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-14\">\u00b66 The doctors at St. Patrick Hospital determined that removal of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>blood clot filter was too complicated for them to attempt and referred Horn to the Oregon Health Sciences University in Portland. Doctors there unsuccessfully attempted to remove the embedded filter. In the process of doing so, the tip of a catheter broke off in the vein and could not be retrieved.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">\u00b67 The OHSU referred Horn to Stanford University where doctors used a unique laser procedure to remove the blood clot filter. The Stanford doctors were unable to remove the fragment of catheter because it was embedded in the wall of Horn\u2019s IVC.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">\u00b68 In September 2013 Horn sued St. Peter\u2019s Hospital seeking to recover damages for medical negligence. The case went to jury trial on August 29, 2016. Horn presented his case, including the testimony of treating doctors as well as two expert medical witnesses. When Horn rested, the Hospital moved for judgment as a matter of law under M. R. Civ. P. 50(a), contending that Horn had failed to prove that the Hospital departed from the applicable standard of care. The District Court denied the motion and the case proceeded, lasting a total of four days.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-7\">\u00b69 The jury returned a verdict in favor of Horn, awarding damages for medical expenses, lost wages, pain and suffering, and mental and emotional distress. On September 14,2016, the District Court entered judgment in Horn\u2019s favor for $492,268.39.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-8\">\u00b610 The Hospital then renewed its motion for judgment as a matter of law and joined it with motions under M. R. Civ. P. 59 and 60 for a new trial and for relief from the judgment. On November 18, 2016, the District Court reversed its prior order and granted the Hospital\u2019s Rule 50(b) motion for judgment as a matter of law, dismissing Horn\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-9\">\u00b611 The District Court\u2019s order reviewed the testimony from the trial, noting that the only express reference to standard of care from Horn\u2019s expert, Dr. Alzheimer, came during cross-examination when he was asked whether the standard of care would vary depending upon where the medical professional practiced. The District Court concluded that Dr. Alzheimer \u201cprovided no opinion\u201d regarding the applicable standard of care, or whether it was breached.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-10\">\u00b612 The District Court noted that Horn\u2019s other expert, Chris Bilyeu, testified about the practices and procedures followed by the hospital where he works in Sheridan, Wyoming. The District Court determined that Bilyeu did not establish that these practices and procedures constituted the standard of care \u201cfor all hospitals,\u201d and did not establish that they should have been followed by the Hospital in this case. The District Court determined that upon review, Bilyeu provided <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>no opinion on the standard of care, and no opinion that the Hospital departed from the standard of care to Horn\u2019s injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">\u00b613 The District Court also noted Horn\u2019s reliance upon the testimony of treating physician Dr. Martin, but again determined that Martin did not testify as to any standard of care or that there was a breach of the standard of care. The District Court further determined that the only expert to testify about a standard of care was the Hospital\u2019s expert, Dr. Moriarty. He testified that the decision to use the IVC filter was within \u201cacceptable medical practice\u201d and met the applicable standard of care. The District Court noted that Moriarty\u2019s testimony was \u201cunrefuted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A3Z\">\u00b614 The District Court rejected Horn\u2019s argument that the record showed negligence by the Hospital and that \u201cmultiple experts either inferred or admitted that the evidence indicated a deviation from what was safe and prudent aftercare.\u201d The District Court concluded that these arguments were unavailing because \u201cinference, implication, and jury purview is not what Montana law requires. Expert testimony as to the standard of care must be presented at trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">\u00b615 Horn appeals, seeking reversal of the District Court\u2019s order and reinstatement of the verdict and judgment in his favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-7\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b478-8\">\u00b616 A district court may only grant judgment as a matter of law under M. R. Civ. P. 50 when \u201cthere is a complete absence of any evidence which would justify submitting an issue to a jury.\u201d <em>Schumacher v. Stephens, </em>1998 MT 58, \u00b6 14, 288 Mont. 115, 956 P.2d 76. All evidence and all legitimate inferences that might be drawn from it \u201cmust be considered in the light most favorable to the party opposing the motion.\u201d <em>Schumacher, </em>\u00b6 14. This Court reviews the district court decision using those same principles to determine whether the district court\u2019s decision was correct. <em>Schumacher, </em>\u00b6 14. Determination of a Rule 50 motion is an issue of law, and this Court provides \u201cfull review ... without special deference to the views of the trial <em>court.\u2019\u2019 Johnson v. Costco Wholesale, </em>2007 MT 43, \u00b6 18, 336 Mont. 105, 152 P.3d 727.</p>\n<p id=\"A70M\">\u00b6 17 Courts should \u201cexercise the greatest self-restraint in interfering with the constitutionally mandated process of a jury decision.\u201d <em>Johnson, </em>\u00b6 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b478-10\">\u00b618 <em>Issue: Whether the District Court erred in granting a judgment as a matter of law in favor of St. Peter\u2019s Hospital following a jury verdict in favor of Eric Horn.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b478-11\">\u00b619 Horn\u2019s claim was that the Hospital was negligent in providing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>care to him. Horn claimed that the Hospital failed to implement procedures to assess the risks of inserting various types of blood clot filters; failed to implement procedures for tracking filters after insertion into a patient; and waited too long to attempt retrieval of his filter. Horn contended that these failures resulted in the filter staying inside his body until retrieval was extremely difficult, requiring successive referrals to high-level medical facilities before the filter could be removed.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">\u00b620 The District Court considered the Hospital\u2019s motion under M. R. Civ. P. 50, which provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-6\">(1) If a party has been fully heard on an issue during a jury trial and the court finds that a reasonable jury would not have a legally sufficient evidentiary basis to find for the party on that issue, the court may:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-7\">(A) resolve the issue against the party; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-8\">(B) grant a motion for judgment as a matter of law against the party on a claim or defense that, under the controlling law, can be maintained or defeated only with a favorable ruling on that issue.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b479-9\">M. R. Civ. P. 50(a)(1). The District Court applied the well-settled governing principle that judgment as a matter of law is</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-10\">properly granted only when there is a complete absence of any evidence which would justify submitting an issue to a jury and all such evidence and any legitimate inferences that might be drawn from the evidence must be considered in the light most favorable to the party opposing the motion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b479-11\"><em>Johnson, </em>\u00b6 13. The District Court also applied the principle that in cases of alleged medical negligence, the plaintiff (Horn) has the burden to establish the standard of care; that the standard was breached; and that he suffered damage. <em>Labair v. Carey, </em>2012 MT 312, \u00b6 29, 367 Mont. 453, 291 P.3d 1160. Expert testimony is required to establish these issues when they are beyond the common experience of the jury and the testimony will assist the jury in understanding the facts. <em>Labair, </em>\u00b6 29. These same principles apply when the case involves alleged medical negligence by a hospital. <em>Dalton v. Kalispell Regional Hosp., </em>256 Mont. 243, 246-47, 846 P.2d 960, 962 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b479-12\">\u00b621 Horn does not dispute that these principles govern his claim against the Hospital. Horn contends that he proved that the Hospital \u201cdid not use reasonable care\u201d in treating him, and that \u201cmultiple experts either inferred or admitted\u201d that there was a \u201cdeviation from what was safe and prudent aftercare.\u201d He contended that the treatment he received was \u201cslipshod and negligently coordinated.\u201d However, after review of the evidence that Horn presented at trial, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>District Court determined that neither of his two medical experts \u201cestablished the requisite standard of care.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">\u00b622 Horn\u2019s expert, Dr. Alzheimer, did not identify any medical standard of care that would have been applicable to Horn\u2019s situation, either as to the Hospital as an organization or as to individual doctors. During Dr. Alzheimer\u2019s testimony, Horn\u2019s attorney read passages from medical articles and from the manufacturer\u2019s package insert for the IVC filter itself, asking him whether he \u201cagreed\u201d with the text. In particular, Dr. Alzheimer \u201cagreeldl\u201d with the \u201cadvice and assessment\u201d in the literature that \u201c[t]he success of retrieval attempts has been shown to decrease with prolonged dwell times, ... highlighting] the importance of frequent follow-up for reassessment of risk and consideration of filter retrieval.\u201d The fact that Dr. Alzheimer \u201cagreed\u201d with what was read to him by the attorney is essentially irrelevant without further testimony that it was part of the established standard of medical care applicable to Horn\u2019s situation. On cross-examination, Dr. Alzheimer also \u201cagreed\u201d that he was not aware of any filter that had been retrieved at the manufacturer\u2019s recommended twenty-three days, that the literature also had reported successful retrieval after a dwell time as long as 3,006 days, and that \u201cthese filters vary from patient to patient.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">\u00b623 Similarly, Horn\u2019s other medical expert Chris Bilyeu failed to provide any testimony as to the standard of care for the defendant hospital. Bilyeu, the medical imaging manager at Sheridan, Wyoming\u2019s eighty-eight-bed hospital, testified that \u201cin [his] department\u201d the company representative is brought in \u201cfor the first couple filter placements to make sure we know\u2014understand how to use them.\u201d In terms of filter retrieval, Bilyeu stated, \u201cUltimately, ... it\u2019s the collaboration between the ordering physician and the radiologist to determine that the filter can come out. We simply just provide an avenue to make sure they understand when the retrieval time is coming up.\u201d As the District Court noted, Bilyeu \u201cprovided testimony of what occurs at the hospital he works at.\u201d However, he \u201cdid not testify this was the standard of care for all hospitals, or opine this is the standard SPH should have utilized.\u201d On cross-examination, Bilyeu acknowledged that he was aware of only one case in which his hospital attempted retrieval of an Optease filter within the manufacturer\u2019s recommended twenty-three days, and his hospital \u201chad to send it out\u201d after an unsuccessful removal attempt. Again, Horn\u2019s second expert failed to provide any description of the standard of care applicable to this case. We have recognized that a medical provider\u2019s \u201cindividual practice, when not based on national standards, lacks relevance to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>medical malpractice <em>case.\u201d Norris v. Fritz, </em>2012 MT 27, \u00b6 44, 364 Mont. 63, 270 P.3d 79. <em>See also Montana Deaconess Hospital v. Gratton, </em>169 Mont. 185, 190, 545 P.2d 670, 673 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">\u00b624 Horn also relies upon two documents from the manufacturer of the Optease filter. One appears to be information for patients as to the purpose, design and placement of the filter. It states, in part, that the filter \u201cmay be placed permanently as an implantable device or temporarily as a retrievable device\u201d depending upon the doctor\u2019s recommendation. The other was an insert into the packaging for the filter itself. It states, in part, that a \u201c21 patient study and a 40 patient retrospective chart review suggest\u201d that the filter \u201ccan be safely retrieved (mean of 11.1 days, range 5-14 days and mean of 16.4 days, range 3-48 days).\u201d The same section of the document then states that the \u201cOptease filter can be safely retrieved up to 23 days.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">\u00b625 While Horn argues that such manufacturer information may contain the standard of medical care, standing alone it does not do so. The issue is that there was no medical expert testimony stating that the manufacturer\u2019s information was the standard of care. There was no description of a standard of care that a jury could comprehend. A doctor witness\u2019s statement that he agreed with this information in no way helps the jury to understand it, and does not in any way establish the medical standard of care that should be followed by all hospitals for blood clot filter cases.</p>\n<p id=\"ajv-dedup-0\">\u00b626  A manufacturer\u2019s recommendation or package insert can be relevant evidence to be considered by the jury, but it is not a substitute for the required expert evidence that describes the standard of care. <em>See Hyman &amp; Armstrong, P.S.C. v. Gunderson, </em>279 S.W.3d 93, 114(Ky. 2008) (concluding that, although information about a drug in the package insert and the Physicians\u2019 Desk Reference \u201cis relevant and useful information regarding the prescribing physician\u2019s standard of care, it is not the sole determinant of the standard of care\u201d); <em>Richardson v. Miller, </em>44 S.W.3d 1, 16-17 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2000) (observing that such materials are \u201cintended to comply with the FDA\u2019s regulations, to provide advertising and promotional material, and to limit the manufacturer\u2019s liability\u201d and cannot, by themselves, be considered prima facie evidence of the prescribing physician\u2019s standard of care; <em>Morlino v. Medical Center of Ocean County, </em>684 A.2d 944, 949 (N. J. Super. App. Div. 1996) (holding that package inserts and parallel Physicians\u2019 Desk Reference information \u201cmay be considered by the jury along with expert testimony to determine the appropriate standard of care\u201d); <em>Craft v. Peebles, </em>893 P.2d 138, 151 (Haw. 1995) (holding that a manufacturer\u2019s insert, in and of itself, may not establish the relevant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>standard of care in a medical negligence action, but may be considered by the fact finder \u201calong with expert testimony\u201d to define the standard of care).</p>\n<p id=\"af3-dedup-0\">\u00b627  Horn attempts to downplay this fundamental failure at trial by dismissing it as only a quibbling over the absence of \u201cmagic words.\u201d As noted above, Montana law has long required the presentation of expert testimony to establish the standard of care in a medical negligence case. <em>Labair, </em>\u00b6 29. The issue here is the total failure to establish for the jury the medical standard of care applicable to this case. Without proof of this fundamental element of the medical negligence case, the jury was essentially left on its own to determine what the standard of care might be. The issue is not the absence of magic words, but rather trial counsel\u2019s failure to meet the clear and established requirements for maintaining a medical negligence case. Without presentation of a standard of care against which the jury can evaluate the medical care Horn received, this case becomes a simple negligence action governed by a \u201creasonable person\u201d standard. This is contrary to Montana law.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">\u00b628 The necessity of proving the first and essential leg of a medical negligence claim was at the forefront throughout this case. The District Court specifically referred to its prior order, which had stated that the \u201cparties agree Horn bears the burden of establishing the standard of care\u201d and that expert testimony is ordinarily required to establish the standard of care. For whatever reason, that was not done when the case went to trial. Unfortunately, Horn must bear the burden of that failure.</p>\n<p id=\"A1O\">\u00b629  The District Court determined that because of the failure to present evidence of the first and essential part of a medical negligence claim, the jury did not have a \u201clegally sufficient evidentiary basis\u201d to return a verdict against the Hospital for medical negligence. As discussed above, this is the threshold for granting a judgment as a matter of law under M. R. Civ. P. 50. The District Court applied the well-settled governing principle that judgment as a matter of law is warranted when there is a complete absence of evidence that would justify submitting an issue to a jury. <em>Johnson, </em>\u00b6 13. With Horn\u2019s complete failure to prove the applicable standard of care, as the District Court eventually recognized, the case should not have been presented to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-8\">\u00b630 We agree with the District Court\u2019s evaluation of the evidence in this case. Even under the very high standard for granting a Rule 50(b) motion, it is clear that Horn\u2019s representatives at trial utterly failed to present evidence on the fundamental requirements of a medical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>negligence case\u2014the applicable medical standard of care; a breach of the standard of care; and damage resulting from that breach. Unfortunately for Horn, this departure from the requirements for a prima facie claim of medical negligence make it impossible to uphold the jury verdict in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">\u00b631 We affirm the District Court\u2019s order granting judgment to the Hospital.</p>\n<judges id=\"b483-7\">justices McKinnon, wheat, sandefur, baker, shea and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
