The District Court held that one provision was unconstitutional, but that it was severable from the remainder of the Compact. The Board appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-11\">\u00b62 We restate the issue on appeal as whether Article II, Section 18 of the Montana Constitution required the Legislature to approve the Compact or its administrative provisions by a two-thirds vote of each house because they granted new immunities to the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-12\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b297-13\">\u00b63 After many years of negotiation, representatives of the State of Montana, through the Reserved Water Rights Compact Commission, providedfor in \u00a7 85-2-702, MCA, the Confederated Salish and Kootenai <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>Tribes (CSK), and the United States agreed to the terms of the Compact as a means of settling water rights disputes involving the Tribes. In 2015 the Montana Legislature approved the Compact, and its lengthy provisions are codified at \u00a7 85-20-1901, MCA. The Legislature concurrently enacted separate administrative and management provisions, codified at \u00a7 85-20-1902, MCA. While the State of Montana has approved the Compact, it will not be effective until after it is also approved by the CSK Tribal Council and by Congress.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">\u00b64 The parties agreed in the Compact that the water right claims of the CSK Tribes should be settled through agreement rather than litigation. The Compact seeks to \u201csecure to all residents of the Reservation the quiet enjoyment of the use of waters of the Reservation\u201d and to provide a \u201cunitary administration system\u201d for appropriation of water and administration of water rights. Art. I, \u00a7 85-20-1901, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">\u00b65 The plaintiff Board oversees the operations of the Flathead, Mission and Jocko Valley Irrigation Districts. The Districts are local governmental entities provided for by Montana law, with locally elected officials. They generally have the authority and responsibility to represent landowners in the various districts as to water and irrigation matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-7\">\u00b66 The Board challenged a specific section of the Compact and a specific section of the administrative provisions. The first, Article IV.I.8 of \u00a7 85-20-1901, MCA, of the Compact provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-8\">The Tribes and the State hereby waive their respective immunities from suit, including any defense the State shall have under the Eleventh Amendment of the Constitution of the United States, in order to permit the resolution of disputes under the Compact by the Board, and the appeal or judicial enforcement of Board decisions as provided herein, except that such waivers of sovereign immunity by the Tribes or the State shall not extend to any action for money damages, costs or attorneys\u2019 fees. The parties recognize that only Congress can waive the immunity of the United States and that the participation of the United States in the proceedings of the Board shall be governed by Federal law, including 43 U.S.C. \u00a7 666.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b298-9\">The second section challenged by the Board is Section 1-2-111 of \u00a7 85-20-1902, MCA, of the administrative and management statute:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-10\">Members of the Board, the Engineer, and Designee, and Water Commissioner appointed pursuant to Section 3-1-114 of this Ordinance, and any Staff shall be immune from suit for damages <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>arising from the lawful discharge of an official duty associated with the carrying out of powers and duties set forth in the Compact or this Ordinance relating to the authorization, administration, or enforcement of water rights on the Reservation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AX7J\">The Board contends that these provisions create new sovereign immunities from suit for the State of Montana, and that Article II, Section 18 of the Montana Constitution therefore requires that they be enacted by a two-thirds majority of each house of the Legislature. The parties agree that neither the Compact nor the management provisions passed either house by a two-thirds majority vote.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">\u00b67 The parties filed cross motions for summary judgment. The District Court found that the case was justiciable and appropriate for judicial resolution. As to the merits, the District Court found that the challenged section of the Compact did not contravene Article II, Section 18 of the Montana Constitution because it did not enact any new immunities from suit. To the contrary, that section waived immunities from suit and so could become effective without a two-thirds majority vote of each house of the Legislature. As to the challenged section of the administrative provisions, the District Court found that it provided \u201cnew immunity to the State and its agents\u201d and therefore was covered by Article II, Section 18 of the Montana Constitution. Since the provision did not pass by a two-thirds majority of each house, the District Court struck it as unconstitutional, but held that it could be severed from the remaining provisions of the enactment.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">\u00b68 The Board appeals and the State cross-appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-7\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b299-8\">\u00b69 All legislative enactments are presumed to be constitutional, and the challenging party bears the \u201cheavy burden\u201d to prove \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d that the challenged statute is unconstitutional. <em>Molnar v. Fox, </em>2013 MT 132, \u00b6 49, 370 Mont. 238, 301 P.3d 824. Courts should strive whenever possible to avoid interpreting a statute in a way that causes it to be unconstitutional. <em>Molnar, </em>\u00b6 38.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-9\">\u00b610 This Court reviews a district court\u2019s decision on summary judgment to determine whether it is correct, using the same criteria under M. R. Civ. P. 56. <em>Pilgeram v. GreenPoint Mortgage, </em>2013 MT 354, \u00b6 9, 373 Mont. 1, 313 P.3d 839.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-10\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b299-11\">\u00b611 <em>Issue: Whether Article II, Section 18 of the Montana Constitution required the Legislature to approve the Compact or its administrative provisions by a two-thirds vote of each house because they granted new </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number><em>immunities to the State.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">\u00b612 As a preliminary matter, the State contends that this case is not justiciable because the Compact has not yet been approved by the CSK Tribes or by Congress and so is not yet in effect. The District Court determined that the legal issues were justiciable, noting that the State has approved the Compact, and has appropriated money to begin implementing it. We agree that because the Montana Legislature has appropriated money for the purpose of implementing the Compact, and its preliminary provisions are being implemented, we are not called upon to issue an advisory opinion here. The issues of Tribal water rights are important both in the Flathead region and statewide, and the issues presented here are purely legal and constitutional. <em>See Confederated Salish &amp; Kootenai Tribes v. </em>Stults, 2002 MT 280, \u00b6 19, 312 Mont. 420, 59 P.3d 1093. Determining the State constitutional challenge now will also resolve any cloud over the deliberations of Congress and the CSK Tribes in considering the Compact. A decision here applies to an existing controversy; the issue can be determined by judicial decision; and the dispute is one of \u201coverriding public moment.\u201d <em>Lee v. State, </em>195 Mont. 1, 6, 635 P.2d 1282, 1284-85 (1981). Therefore, we proceed to consider the merits of the legal issues raised by the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">\u00b613 In 1972 the State of Montana waived its sovereign immunity from suit with adoption of Article II, Section 18 of the Constitution. <em>Silverstone v. Park County, </em>2007 MT 261, \u00b6 12, 339 Mont. 299, 170 P.3d 950. Despite that waiver, the State remains immune from suit for money damages in federal courts because of the Eleventh Amendment to the United States Constitution. <em>Brown v. Montana, </em>442 F. Supp. 2d 982, 988 (D. Mont. 2006). A state may waive sovereign immunity from suit in its own courts without waiving its Eleventh Amendment immunity. <em>Montana v. Peretti, </em>661 F.2d 756, 757 (9th Cir. 1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b300-7\">\u00b614 The Montana Constitution provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-8\">The state, counties, cities, towns and all other local governmental entities shall have no immunity from suit for injury to a person or property, except as may be specifically provided by law by a 2/3 vote of each house of the legislature.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b300-9\">Mont. Const. art. II, \u00a7 18. This provision restrains the Legislature in asserting sovereign immunity from suit, but it \u201cdoes not in any way prohibit the legislature from <em>waiving </em>sovereign immunity in any case.\u201d <em>Byorth v. District Court, </em>175 Mont. 63, 66, 572 P.2d 201, 203 (1977) (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"AaP\">\u00b615  The District Court determined that the Compact provision providing for a \u201cwaiver of immunity\u201d in Article IV. 1.8 of \u00a7 85-20-1901, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>MCA, did not violate the provisions of Article II, Section 18 of the Montana Constitution. The District Court determined that this provision was a <em>waiver </em>of immunity, not a grant of new immunity. The District Court determined that the two-thirds legislative approval requirement of Article II, Section 18 of the Montana Constitution applies only to the imposition of new immunities from suit and therefore does not apply to new waivers of immunity. We agree with the District Court\u2019s construction of the plain language of the Constitution and the Compact. Article IV. 1.8 of \u00a7 85-20-1901, MCA, of the Compact on its face did not create any new immunity from suit and so could be enacted by less than a two-thirds majority of each house.</p>\n<p id=\"A5m\">\u00b616 The disputed immunity provision in the administrative and management statute is Section 1-2-111 of \u00a7 85-20-1902, MCA (quoted above). The administrative statute creates a Water Management Board consisting of two members appointed by the Governor, two appointed by the CSK Tribal Council, and a fifth selected by those appointees. The Board is responsible for appointing an Engineer and any Water Commissioners. Sec. 1-2-110,3-1-114, \u00a7 85-20-1902, MCA. The District Court determined that it clearly \u201ccreates a new sovereign immunity for the state, and for its agents or employees.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">\u00b617 It is established that \u201cimmunities separate and distinct from sovereign immunity remained unaffected by the language of Article II, Section 18.\u201d <em>Silverstone v. Park County, </em>2007 MT 261, \u00b6 13, 339 Mont. 299, 170 P.3d 950. Individuals who are judges, prosecutors, and members of quasi-judicial bodies, for example, have immunities from suit for actions taken in their designated positions. <em>Silverstone, </em>\u00b6 13; \u00a7 2-9-112, MCA (providingfor judicial immunity.) Article II, Section 18 on its face plainly applies only to new sovereign immunities enacted for the benefit of the \u201cstate, counties, cities, towns and all other local governmental entities.\u201d The immunity provision of the administrative and management ordinance, Section 1-2-111 of \u00a7 85-20-1902, MCA, does not establish or alter any immunity as to the \u201cstate, counties, cities, towns [or] other local governmental entities.\u201d To the contrary, the new immunities provided there specifically apply only to designated individuals\u2014\u201cMembers of the Board, the Engineer, and Designee, and Water Commissioners appointed pursuant to Section 3-1-114 of this Ordinance, and any Staff.\u201d We decline to consider any extrinsic materials to determine legislative intent here because it is clear on the face of the statute. <em>Swanson v. Consumer Direct, </em>2017 MT 57, \u00b6 16, 387 Mont. 37, 391 P.3d 79. State governmental entities listed in Article II, Section 18 of the Montana Constitution are not covered by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>this immunity provision in the management ordinance.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"anl-dedup-0\">\u00b618 Montana law in other contexts recognizes immunities from suit as to individual public employees, apart from immunities for the governmental entities themselves. Section 2-9-305(2), MCA, provides that a State employee is immune from suit if the governmental entity employer acknowledges or is bound by a judicial determination that the employee was acting in the course and scope of employment. Also, for example, see \u00a7 2-9-112(2), MCA, granting immunity from suit for damages to a \u201cmember, officer, or agent of the judiciary\u201d; \u00a7 7-33-2208(2), MCA, granting a chief or deputy of a rural fire district immunity from suit resulting from certain firefighting activities; and \u00a7 41-2-203, MCA, immunizing from suit persons who report child abuse, in certain situations.</p>\n<p id=\"A3UG\">\u00b619  The District Court reached an incorrect conclusion of law by construing the disputed provision of the administrative statutes as providing a new immunity from suit for the State of Montana. The provision on its face does not provide any new immunity to the State of Montana or to any other governmental entity. Therefore, Article II, Section 18 of the Montana Constitution does not apply, and the District Court\u2019s decision to the contrary is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"azq-dedup-1\">\u00b620  The disputed provisions of the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Water Compact are consistent with Article II, Section 18 of the Montana Constitution. The District Court is affirmed in part and reversed in part.</p>\n<judges id=\"b302-7\">JUSTICES McKINNON, BAKER, WHEAT, SHEA and SANDEFUR concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b302-11\"> We need not consider whether the Board itself is a State, Tribal or Federal entity because the only immunity provided is to \u201cmembers\u201d of the Board.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b302-8\">JUSTICE McKINNON,</author>\n<p id=\"anl-dedup-1\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-9\">\u00b621 I agree with the Court\u2019s resolution of the disputed provisions of the Compact. I write separately only to address the State\u2019s contention raised in its cross-appeal that the Board does not have standing because the Board\u2019s claims are hypothetical and seek an advisory opinion by this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-10\">\u00b622 The judicial power of the courts is limited to justiciable controversies. <em>Reichert v. State, </em>2012 MT 111, \u00b6 53, 365 Mont. 92, 278 P.3d 455. This limitation is premised upon both constitutional requirements and policy or prudential considerations. <em>Plan Helena, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number><em>Inc. v. Helena Reg\u2019l Airport Auth. Bd., </em>2010 MT 26, \u00b6 6, 355 Mont. 142, 226 P.3d 567. The constitutional component derives from Article VII, Section 4, of the Montana Constitution which confers original jurisdiction on district courts in \u201call civil matters and cases at law and in equity.\u201d Mont. Const. art. VII, \u00a7 4(1). This language has been interpreted as embodying the same limitations as those imposed on federal courts by the \u201ccase or controversy\u201d provision of Article III, Section 2, of the United States Constitution. <em>Olson v. Dep\u2019t of Revenue, </em>223 Mont. 464, 469-70, 726 P.2d 1162, 1166 (1986). Thus, federal precedent interpreting Article III requirements for justiciability are persuasive authority for interpreting justiciability requirements of Article VII, Section 4(1), of the Montana Constitution. <em>Plan Helena, </em>\u00b6 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">\u00b623 In federal jurisprudence, \u201cthe irreducible constitutional minimum of standing has three elements: injury in fact (a concrete harm that is actual or imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical), causation (a fairly traceable connection between the injury and the conduct complained of), and redressability (a likelihood that the requested relief will redress the alleged injury).\u201d <em>Heffernan v. Missoula City Council, </em>2011 MT 91, \u00b6 32, 360 Mont. 207, 255 P.3d 80 <em>(citing Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, </em>504 U.S. 555, 560-61, 112 S. Ct. 2130, 2136 (1992); <em>Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better Env\u2019t, </em>523 U.S. 83, 103, 118 S. Ct. 1003, 1016-17 (1998)). Regarding the first element, injury in fact, we have explained that a plaintiff must have suffered \u201ca past, present, or threatened injury to a property or civil right, and that the injury would be alleviated by successfully maintaining the action.\u201d <em>Schoof v. Nesbit, </em>2014 MT 6, \u00b6 15, 373 Mont. 226, 316 P.3d 831; <em>accord Chipman v. Nw. Healthcare Corp., </em>2012 MT 242, \u00b6\u00b6 26-27, 366 Mont. 450, 288 P.3d 193. As to the requirement of present or threatened injury, \u201c[ojther courts have held and we agree, that potential economic injury is sufficient to establish standing.\u201d <em>Mont. Human Rights Div. v. City of Billings, </em>199 Mont. 434, 443, 649 P.2d 1283, 1288 (1982). In <em>Rosebud County v. Department of Revenue, </em>257 Mont. 306, 849 P.2d 177 (1993), a county\u2019s substantial interest in the protection of its tax base and its potential for economic harm in the valuation of heavy equipment was sufficient to give the county standing to challenge administrative rules. Also, in <em>Missoula City-County Air Pollution Control Board v. Board of Environmental Review, </em>282 Mont. 255, 937 P.2d 463 (1997), this Court held that a local air pollution control board established a threatened injury when it faced potential economic harm from the additional expenses necessary to monitor, collect, and analyze data and to develop a regulatory response pursuant to an administrative rule regulating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>air pollution that applied within its jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\">\u00b624 This case is unique in that the dispute arises out of a provision in an agreement negotiated among the United States, the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes (CSK), and the State of Montana. The Compact represents a negotiated compromise among the parties, in lieu of adjudicating the water claims of the CSK and its members in protracted, expensive, and uncertain litigation. <em>See In re Crow Water Compact, </em>2015 MT 217, \u00b6 6, 380 Mont. 168, 354 P.3d 1217. The Flathead Joint Board of Control is the joint board of operations for the Flathead Irrigation District, Mission Irrigation District, and Jocko Valley Irrigation District, which are elected local government bodies under Montana law. The Board is responsible for representing irrigators within its districts and overseeing irrigation operations. Other Appellants are Board members, property owners, and individual irrigators. Appellants allege that the Compact operates to immunize the State from any responsibility for money damages. Specifically, Appellants allege that the Compact creates a new administrative hierarchy with defined and unitary enforcement authority to administer and manage water of the several irrigation districts. Appellants maintain that the Compact\u2019s immunity provisions will prohibit administrative bodies from awarding money damages and that the Compact operates to eliminate a party\u2019s right to obtain money damages in any forum. Appellants allege an injury in fact on the basis of a threatened economic harm\u2014the inability to be compensated for injuries as a result of an unconstitutional immunization provision\u2014which they argue is imminent because the Montana Legislature approved the Compact and it became law. Appellants argue that, although the Compact has not been ratified by Congress, planning, design, and implementation of adaptive management programs has already begun to occur prior to the Compact\u2019s effective date.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">\u00b625 I would conclude that Appellants have alleged a threatened economic injury and that the threatened injury is imminent. Appellants\u2019 rights under the Compact have been conclusively established by the Montana Legislature, absent review by this Court. While the Compact requires approval by other parties to become effective, as it relates to the Board, irrigators, and property owners, the Compact has been adopted in Montana and is currently being implemented by the Compact Implementation Technical Team (CITT). The Compact is no longer imminent in Montana, but has become Montana law, \u00a7 85-20-1901, MCA. The delay in ratification by the remaining parties does not disfranchise Appellants of standing when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>they seek a determination of their rights under a Montana law they assert is unconstitutional. Appellants\u2019 injuries and challenges are distinguishable from those of the taxpayers we concluded did not have standing in <em>Mitchell v. Glacier County, </em>No. DA 16-0716, 2017 MT 258, 389 Mont. 122, 406 P.3d 427, 2017 Mont. LEXIS 649 (Oct. 25, 2017). In <em>Mitchell, </em>taxpayers alleged errors in the county\u2019s budgeting and accounting of revenues and a failure of the county to comply with the Single Audit Act. We held that although there were deficit balances in particular funds, the county\u2019s total government funds were more than adequate to meet the county\u2019s needs and taxpayers could not show that an increase in taxes was actual or imminent. <em>Mitchell, </em>\u00b6 37. As taxpayers were unable to demonstrate an injury in fact and had not raised a constitutional challenge to the Single Audit Act, we found they lacked standing. <em>Mitchell, </em>\u00b6 43.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">\u00b626 Here, Appellants challenge the constitutionality of a recently enacted statute that would eliminate their rights to obtain money damages in any forum. Appellants are either water users of the district or are responsible for representing water users and overseeing irrigation operations. The Compact has become Montana law and is being implemented by the CITT. The Appellants, in my view, have demonstrated a threatened injury in fact and satisfied the first requirement for constitutional standing. The remaining elements for constitutional standing\u2014causation and redressability\u2014are also established. If Appellants were to successfully challenge the immunity provisions, those provisions would be declared unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">\u00b627 The constitutional requirements of standing have been described as \u201cabsolute,\u201d while the prudential limitations have been described as \u201cmalleable.\u201d <em>Schoof, </em>\u00b6 15. Having found that Appellants meet the constitutional minimum requirements for standing, there remains the prudential limitation of standing to consider. These are discretionary limits on the exercise of judicial power that \u201ccannot be defined by hard and fast <em>rules Air Pollution Control Bd., </em>282 Mont. at 260, 937 P.2d at 466. For example, a litigant may only assert her own constitutional rights or immunities, <em>Jones v. Mont. Univ. Sys., </em>2007 MT 82, \u00b6 48, 337 Mont. 1, 155 P.3d 1247, and the alleged injury should be distinguishable from the injury to the public generally, though not exclusive to the plaintiff, <em>Bd. of Trs. v. Cut Bank Pioneer Press, </em>2007 MT 115, \u00b6 15, 337 Mont. 229, 160 P.3d 482, <em>superseded by statute, </em>20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1232g(a)(4)(A), <em>as recognized in Krakauer v. State, </em>2016 MT 230, \u00b6 22, 384 Mont. 527, 381 P.3d 524. Prudential limitations of standing generally involve a weighing of the fitness of the issues for judicial decision and the hardship to the parties of withholding court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>consideration. <em>Reichert, </em>\u00b6 56. The principal consideration under the fitness inquiry is whether there is a factually adequate record upon which to base effective review. <em>Reichert, </em>\u00b6 56<em>; Havre Daily News, LLC v. City of Havre, </em>2006 MT 215, \u00b6 20, 333 Mont. 331, 142 P.3d 864. Finally, there is the countervailing factor weighing against these prudential restrictions of whether the question is important to the public. <em>Air Pollution Control Bd., </em>282 Mont. at 260, 937 P.2d at 466.</p>\n<p id=\"A6IB\">\u00b628 None of the prudential limitations to standing exist in these proceedings. The Appellants have existing water rights and management responsibilities which are clearly affected by the Compact, rights that are distinguishable from the public generally. Moreover, the inquiry here requires the Court to examine the terms of the Compact in relation to the requirements of Article II, Section 18, of the Montana Constitution. It is a question which is nearly entirely one of law and not dependent upon additional facts to aid the Court\u2019s inquiry. <em>See Havre Daily News, </em>\u00b6 20. The record is factually adequate to enable this Court to make the necessary legal determinations.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">\u00b629 Weighing heavily in favor of finding standing is the significance to the litigants of having the constitutionality of the Compact\u2019s immunity provisions conclusively determined. This is the \u201ccountervailing factor weighing against ... prudential restrictions,\u201d <em>Heffernan, </em>\u00b6 33, and I fully agree with the Court in its recognition that \u201c[dietermining the State constitutional challenge now will also resolve any cloud over the deliberations of Congress and the CSK Tribes in considering the Compact.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 12. In my view, deferring a determination of the challenged provisions until ratification of the Compact by Congress, the CSK, and the Montana Water Court would consume valuable resources with no corresponding benefit were we to conclude after the parties\u2019 ratification that the immunity provisions of the Compact were unconstitutional. Clearly, the circumstances here, which require ratification of a negotiated agreement by federal, state, and tribal governments, and approval of the Montana Water Court, are unique. The complexities of ratification by the various government entities necessitate a delay in the effective date of the Compact, although Appellants\u2019 rights have been conclusively determined by the Montana Legislature. Under these unique circumstances, I would find Appellants have alleged an imminent, threatened injury under Montana law and constitutional requirements for standing have been met; further, prudential considerations of standing favor this Court substantively addressing the merits of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">\u00b630 I otherwise concur in the Court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-7\">JUSTICE BAKER joins in the concurring Opinion of JUSTICE <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>McKinnon.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b307-5\">JUSTICE RICE,</author>\n<p id=\"ahg-dedup-0\">concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">\u00b631 I concur with the Court\u2019s determination that this matter is justiciable.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-7\">\u00b632 Regarding Article IV.I.8 of the Compact, the District Court held that the provision was a waiver of immunity, and not a grant of immunity subject to a \u201c2/3 vote of each house of the legislature.\u201d Mont. Const. Art. II, sec. 18. The Court states its agreement here \u201cwith the District Court\u2019s construction of the plain language of the Constitution and the Compact,\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 15, and I likewise concur. As the District Court explained, this provision constitutes \u201ca limited waiver of [the state\u2019s] sovereign immunity, under the Eleventh Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, which prohibits the state [from] being sued in a federal court.\u201d The District Court stated that the waiver of immunity would permit \u201ccertain kinds of suits,\u201d which would include, under the language of the Compact, actions for \u201cthe resolution of disputes under the Compact by the Board, and the appeal or judicial enforcement of Board decisions as provided herein.\u201d The provision clarifies that this waiver \u201cshall not extend to any action for money damages, costs or attorneys\u2019 fees.\u201d Thus, the effect of the provision is to <em>permit </em>actions against the state in federal court (a waiver of Eleventh Amendment immunity), not to <em>prohibit </em>actions against the state (a grant of immunity).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b307-8\">\u00b633 Unlike the Court, I also agree with the District Court\u2019s analysis of the Administrative Statute, \u00a7 85-20-1902, subsection 1-2-111, MCA. That provision, entitled \u201cImmunity from Suit,\u201d provides that \u201cMembers of the Board, the Engineer, any Designee, any Water Commissioner ... and any Staff shall be immune from suit for damages\u201d arising out of the discharge of their respective duties. While I acknowledge that members of state boards enjoy common law quasi-judicial immunity for actions taken pursuant to their adjudicatory duties, <em>see Rahrer v. Board of </em>Psychologists, 2000 MT 9, \u00b6\u00b6 12-20, 298 Mont. 28, 993 P.2d 680, the Administrative Statute goes beyond the boundaries of our common law quasi-judicial immunity and grants immunity to agents and employees of the state, as well as immunity to board members that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>is more broadly stated than our common law quasi-judicial immunity. <em>See Rahrer, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 16-17. The Court distinguishes this grant of immunity from the immunities enacted for the benefit of \u201cstate, counties, cities, towns and all other local government entities\u201d under Article II, Section 18, but I do not believe this to be a persuasive distinction. Governments act through their agents. \u201cEvery government entity is subject to liability for its torts and those of its employees acting within the scope of their employment or duties whether arising out of a governmental or proprietary function. ...\u201d Section 2-9-102, MCA. As noted by the District Court, this conclusion appears to be bolstered by the legislative history of the Compact\u2019s passage. Thus, this provision required passage by a 2/3 vote of each house of the legislature and, lacking such, is invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">\u00b634 Section 1-1-113(1) of the Administrative Statute provides that its provisions \u201care severable, and a finding of invalidity of one or more provisions hereof shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions.\u201d Pursuant thereto, I would affirm the District Court\u2019s invalidation and severance of the provision, and dissent from that portion of the Court\u2019s opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b307-9\"> The District Court also suggested that \u201can obvious problem\u201d with this federal court remedy \u201cis that federal courts do not appear to even have subject matter jurisdiction to entertain such cases under current laws .... The limited \u2018remedy\u201d outlined in the Compact thus appears to be illusory. It may never exist as postulated.\u201d This possibly implicated issue of due process of law and related constitutional concerns about the water right process are not before us in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
