Brandt performed surgery to repair Yvonne Wilson\u2019s torn ACL in February 2008. She began to experience new and excruciating knee pain shortly after surgery. On November 5, 2012, Wilson filed a claim with the District Court asserting that Dr. Brandt negligently performed surgery on her knee. The District Court granted summary judgment to Dr. Brandt, holding that Wilson\u2019s claim was filed after the three-year statute of limitations had run. Wilson appeals, arguing the District Court erred in concluding as a matter of law that her claims were barred by the applicable statute of limitations. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-8\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b414-9\">\u00b62 On October 30,2007, Wilson twisted her left knee while removing a pool cover at work. An MRI showed a medial meniscus tear of her left knee. Dr. Brandt, an orthopedic surgeon at Flathead Valley Orthopedic Center, P.C. (FVOC), performed a medial meniscus resection on December 13, 2007, to repair the tear. During surgery, Dr. Brandt discovered that Wilson\u2019s ACL was partially torn, but did not repair the tear, noting that the chance of needing additional surgery was less than 50 percent. Wilson\u2019s symptoms of knee instability and buckling continued, however, and Dr. Brandt performed ACL reconstruction surgery on February 4, 2008. The ACL reconstruction procedure involved drilling a hole through the tibia bone, known as a \u201ctibial tunnel.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b414-10\">\u00b63 In follow-up appointments from March through May 2008, Dr. Brandt noted that Wilson was \u201cdoing absolutely fabulous,\u201d \u201cextremely well,\u201d and was \u201capproaching maximum medical improvement.\u201d His notes after the May 2008 appointment indicate that Wilson was having \u201csome pes anserinus pain.\u201d The pes anserinus refers to the area where three tendons insert into the tibia bone located at the inner part of the knee. Dr. Brandt gave her a local injection of cortisone to help ease the pain.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-11\">\u00b64 Contrary to Dr. Brandt\u2019s impressions, Wilson testified that in the weeks following surgery, she experienced new and excruciating pain at the site of the tibial tunnel, as well as popping and cracking and continued knee buckling. She testified that during this time she \u201cdidn\u2019t know\u201d if the \u201cpain ... was related to the hole that had been drilled in [her] knee,\u201d and that she did not ask why she was having the new pain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>because she had had \u201ctwo different types of surgeries, one was more aggressive than the other, like the ACL is more aggressive than the meniscus. And so [she] thought it all joined together.\u201d During her deposition, in response to the question whether she thought there was something new wrong, she said she was \u201cconcerned\u201d and that she \u201cknew there was something wrong\u201d with her knee during this time. In July 2008, Dr. Brandt performed a third knee surgery on Wilson after she fell and reinjured her left knee meniscus.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">\u00b65 Dr. Brandt\u2019s notes from a September 2008 appointment state that Wilson was \u201cstarting to have some nerve type pain.\u201d The notes go on to say that he told Wilson that she would \u201cget better and the nerve pain will burn out.\u201d At Wilson\u2019s appointment on October 8, 2008, Dr. Brandt noted that Wilson \u201ccontinueldl to struggle\u201d and that \u201cI have discussed with the patient that I am really not certain what is going on\u201d and that she was \u201cnot within the bell curve of normalcy\u201d for recovery after an ACL surgery. He ordered an MRI to rule out \u201cinternal derangement.\u201d In his notes reviewing the October 2008 MRI, Dr. Brandt stated that he \u201ccontinueldl to diagnose this as complex regional pain syndrome\u201d\u2014also known as reflex sympathetic dystrophy (RSD)\u2014that \u201cwill eventually burn out.\u201d Wilson testified that sometime during this period Dr. Brandt told her that RSD developed because \u201che did too many surgeries in a short period of time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">\u00b66 Over the next several months, Wilson met with Ann Ingraham, a nurse practitioner at FVOC, and continued to report knee pain to her. On January 13, 2009, Ingraham ordered another MRI to investigate the pain. Upon review of the MRI, Dr. Brandt noted that Wilson continued to report a \u201csignificant amount of nerve pain,\u201d but he saw \u201cno interval change\u201d since the last MRI. He believed additional surgical intervention would be inappropriate based on what he saw in the MRI. Wilson, meanwhile, continued to report pain to her healthcare providers. After another MRI on June 25, 2009, Dr. Brandt repeated his recommendation that further surgical intervention would be inappropriate. In September 2009, Wilson\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation insurance stopped authorizing further treatment from FVOC providers. She was referred from FVOC to Montana Center for Wellness &amp; Pain Management on November 3, 2009, to manage her pain.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-7\">\u00b67 In June 2010, providers at the Montana Center referred Wilson to Dr. James Blasingame, an orthopedic surgeon with Northwest Orthopedics and Sports Medicine, for a second opinion about her continuing knee pain. Dr. Blasingame wrote in his notes from her initial appointment that he did not think Wilson had RSD and ordered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>another MRI. At the July 26, 2010 appointment to discuss the results of the MRI, Dr. Blasingame noted \u201ca somewhat unusual tibial tunnel\u201d and a possible need for surgical intervention. After gathering other opinions, Dr. Blasingame met with Wilson again on September 10, 2010, and recommended surgical intervention to bone graft the tibial tunnel. He noted he was \u201cunclear as to the exact reason for her knee discomfort. Certainly, the patient\u2019s study is quite abnormal with the course of the graft and the subchondral support being compromised by the graft.\u201d On December 7, 2010, he noted: \u201cThe thought of bone grafting [the tibial tunnel] was an effort to decrease her pain, obviously, but the pain may well be multifactorial as fully outlined in the chart.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">\u00b68 The Montana State Fund sent Wilson to get another opinion from Dr. Michael J. Schutte on January 25, 2011. Upon review of her MRI and medical records, Dr. Schutte noted an \u201canterior impingement of ACL graft tissue related to aberrant tunnel placement\u201d and suggested a two-stage surgical intervention. Wilson attested in an affidavit: \u201cI did not know that Dr. Brandt messed up my surgery until I met with Dr. Schutte.\u201d Dr. Blasingame agreed with Dr. Schutte\u2019s recommendation for a two-stage procedure and performed the first stage of the surgical intervention in April 2011.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">\u00b69 On May 7, 2012, Wilson filed her complaint with the Montana Medical Legal Panel (MMLP), claiming that Dr. Brandt negligently performed surgery on her knee on February 4,2008, by drilling a tibial tunnel in the wrong location. The MMLP issued its decision on August 21, 2012, and Wilson filed her complaint with the District Court on November 5,2012. Dr. Brandt moved for summary judgment, arguing that Wilson\u2019s claims were barred by the three-year statute of limitations contained in \u00a7 27-2-205, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-7\">\u00b610 The District Court reviewed the evidence submitted and held that Wilson discovered the fact that she was injured and tied that injury to Dr. Brandt\u2019s ACL surgery within two months of the February 2008 surgery.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The District Court held that the injury was not self-concealing, citing Wilson\u2019s testimony that she experienced new pain in the place where she knew Dr. Brandt had drilled a hole in her bone, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>well as other new symptoms, shortly after her ACL surgery. The court emphasized further that Wilson said she \u201cknew there was something wrong.\u201d The District Court entered summary judgment in favor of Dr. Brandt.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">\u00b611 We review a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment de novo. <em>Dvorak v. Mont. State Fund, </em>2013 MT 210, \u00b6 15, 371 Mont. 175, 305 P.3d 873. We apply the criteria of M. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(3) to determine whether there is a \u201cgenuine issue as to any material fact\u201d and whether \u201cthe movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d M. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(3); <em>see also Dvorak, </em>\u00b6 15. In evaluating a motion for summary judgment, we review the record independently and afford no deference to the district court\u2019s decision. <em>Siebken v. Voderberg, </em>2012 MT 291, \u00b6 20, 367 Mont. 344, 291 P.3d 572. We view the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party and draw all reasonable inferences from the evidence in favor of the party opposing summary judgment. <em>Siebken, </em>\u00b6 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b417-8\">\u00b612 Wilson argues that the District Court erred in granting summary judgment because the date on which she discovered or reasonably should have discovered her injury involves disputed issues of material fact. She argues that the District Court ignored facts that demonstrate genuine issues for trial, such as Dr. Brandt\u2019s diagnosis of RSD to explain her pain. She argues that under <em>Lorang v. Fortis Ins. Co., </em>2008 MT 252, \u00b6 136, 345 Mont. 12, 192 P.3d 186, \u201cquestions of fact may be determined as a matter of law on summary judgment if \u2018reasonable minds could reach but one conclusion\u2019 on the issue.\u201d (quoting <em>Seeley v. Davis, </em>284 Mont. 517, 523, 946 P.2d 119, 122 (1997)). Wilson maintains that reasonable minds could reach different conclusions about when she discovered or reasonably should have discovered her injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-9\">\u00b613 Dr. Brandt counters that the statute of limitations begins to run when a plaintiff discovers or through reasonable diligence should discover (1) her injury, and (2) that the injury \u201cmay have been caused\u201d by the defendant medical provider. <em>Wisher v. Higgs, </em>257 Mont. 132, 144, 849 P.2d 152, 159 (1993), <em>overruled on other grounds by Blackburn v. Blue Mt. Women\u2019s Clinic, </em>286 Mont. 60, 75, 951 P.2d 1, 10 (1997). He argues that the disputed facts that Wilson raises are irrelevant to this determination, because her testimony and the testimony from two of her friends establish that within a few months of her ACL surgery Wilson discovered (1) her injury, and (2) that it may have been caused <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>by Dr. Brandt\u2019s actions\u2014more than three years before she filed her claim with the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">\u00b614 Since 1971, the limitations period for medical malpractice has been governed by its own statute, separate from the general statute of limitations for other torts. 1971 Mont. Laws ch. 328, \u00a7 1. In adopting \u00a7 27-2-205, MCA, the Legislature codified language from this Court\u2019s discovery doctrine case law. <em>Compare </em>1971 Mont. Laws ch. 328, \u00a7 1 (tolling the statute of limitations until \u201cthe plaintiff discovers, or through the use of reasonable diligence should have discovered, the injury\u201d); <em>with Johnson v. St. Patrick\u2019s Hosp., </em>148 Mont. 125, 132, 417 P.2d 469, 473 (1966) (holding that, when a surgeon negligently leaves a foreign object in a patient\u2019s body, the statute of limitations is tolled \u201cuntil the patient learns of, or in exercise of reasonable care and diligence should have learned of the presence of such foreign object in his body\u201d). Section 27-2-205, MCA (2007)\u2014the statute in effect at the time of Wilson\u2019s ACL reconstruction surgery in 2008\u2014provides, in relevant part, that actions for medical malpractice \u201cmust ... be commenced within 3 years after the date of injury <em>or within 3 years after the plaintiff discovers or through the use of reasonable diligence should have discovered the injury, whichever occurs last.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">\u00b615 Our jurisprudence around the medical malpractice statute of limitations borrows both from prior case law and from the general tort statute of limitations. Section 27-2-205, MCA, codified a specific version of the discovery doctrine for medical malpractice cases. Some of our prior decisions applying \u00a7 27-2-205, MCA, rely on cases that are not governed by \u00a7 27-2-205, MCA, to interpret the statute. The parties repeat this framework of analysis in their briefing on appeal, discussing at length whether Wilson\u2019s injury was \u201cconcealed or self-concealing.\u201d But when the Legislature amended the general statute of limitations for torts, it adopted different language for the discovery doctrine applicable to torts other than medical malpractice. <em>See </em>1987 Mont. Laws ch. 441, \u00a7 1; \u00a7 27-2-102(3), MCA. By adopting different statutes, the Legislature has made clear that, for purposes of tolling the statute of limitations, medical malpractice is treated differently from other torts. <em>See </em>\u00a7 27-2-102(4), MCA (\u201cSubsection (3) [prescribing the discovery doctrine exceptions to the general tort statute of limitations] does not apply to actions involving the limitations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>contained in 27-2-205 [the medical malpractice statute of limitations].\u201d); <em>Gregg v. Whitefish City Council, </em>2004 MT 262, \u00b6 38, 323 Mont. 109, 99 P.3d 151 (\u201cDifferent language is to be given different construction.\u201d). Here, we apply to the facts of this case the language of \u00a7 27-2-205, MCA, in the context of the Legislature\u2019s adoption of somewhat different language when it later codified the discovery doctrine in \u00a7 27-2-102(3), MCA, for all other torts.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">\u00b616 Before the enactment of \u00a7 27-2-205, MCA, this Court had adopted the discovery doctrine in medical malpractice cases. <em>Johnson, </em>148 Mont. at 132, 417 P.2d at 473. Under this doctrine, the statute of limitations was tolled \u201cuntil the patient learns of, or in exercise of reasonable care and diligence should have learned of,\u201d his or her injury. <em>Johnson, </em>148 Mont. at 132, 417 P.2d at 473. Making this determination required \u201clookfing] carefully at the facts of each case presented, for the problems presented in each is how and when the patient discovered the negligence.\u201d <em>Johnson, </em>148 Mont. at 128, 417 P.2d at 470. The doctrine was based on equitable considerations of \u201cgiving full scope to the statute of limitations on the one hand and according a reasonable measure of justice to the plaintiff on the other.\u201d <em>Grey v. Silver Bow Cnty., </em>149 Mont. 213, 217, 425 P.2d 819, 821 (1967) (quoting <em>Owens v. White, </em>342 F.2d 817, 820 (9th Cir. 1965)). In summing up the development of the discovery doctrine in our early case law, we explained in <em>Bennett v. Dow Chem. Co. </em>that the discovery doctrine allowed the statute of limitations to be tolled until a plaintiff discovered that his injury \u201cmay have been caused\u201d by the defendant, but not \u201cbeyond discovery of the cause of an injury.\u201d <em>Bennett, </em>220 Mont. 117, 121, 713 P.2d 992, 995 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">\u00b617 Between the 1971 enactment of \u00a7 27-2-205, MCA, and the 1987 amendment of \u00a7 27-2-102, MCA, this Court continued to use and develop the discovery doctrine outside the medical malpractice context. <em>See, e.g., Bennett, </em>220 Mont. at 121-22, 713 P.2d at 995 (discussing application of the discovery doctrine to negligence and products liability claims). During this time, we clarified limitations on use of the discovery doctrine, applying the doctrine only if the injury was self-concealing by its nature or if the defendant concealed the facts of the injury from the injured party. <em>See Monroe v. Harper, </em>164 Mont. 23, 27, 518 P.2d 788, 790 (1974), <em>overruled on other grounds by Blackburn, </em>286 Mont. at 75, 951 P.2d at 10. In 1987, the Legislature incorporated these developments into the general statute of limitations for torts. 1987 Mont. Laws ch. 441, \u00a7 1. In enacting these amendments, the Legislature also changed the requirement from discovery of the \u201cinjury\u201d to discovery of \u201cthe facts constituting the claim,\u201d after hearing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>testimony that this was a better reflection of this Court\u2019s discovery doctrine case law. Senate Judiciary Committee Report, January 29, 1987, p. 8. Section 27-2-205, MCA, however, has not been amended to reflect these developments. Despite this, this Court has relied on cases outside medical malpractice without distinction or clarification when called on to interpret the medical malpractice statute of limitations in \u00a7 27-2-205, MCA. <em>See, e.g., Wisher, </em>257 Mont. at 140, 849 P.2d at 156-57.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">\u00b618 Although it is not improper for us to look to these developments in the law to aid our interpretation of the statute, we must do so with the role of the judge in mind. When interpreting a statute, it is our role \u201csimply to ascertain and declare what is in terms or in substance contained therein, not to insert what has been omitted or to omit what has been inserted.\u201d Section 1-2-101, MCA. The plain language of \u00a7 27-2-205, MCA, does not call for a separate determination that an injury be \u201cself-concealing\u201d or that the defendant took \u201caction which prevents the injured party from discovering the injury or its cause\u201d in order to toll the statute of limitations. The express exclusion of medical malpractice from the general discovery statute, \u00a7 27-2-102(4), MCA, reinforces this. The terms of \u00a7 27-2-205, MCA, instead allow the tolling of medical malpractice claims until the time that a plaintiff \u201cdiscovers or through the use of reasonable diligence should have discovered the injury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">\u00b619 We have interpreted the statute of limitation provision contained in \u00a7 27-2-205, MCA, on three occasions: <em>Major v. N. Valley Hosp., </em>233 Mont 25, 759 P.2d 153 (1988), <em>overruled on other grounds by Blackburn, </em>286 Mont. at 75, 951 P.2d at 10; <em>Wisher, </em>257 Mont. at 132, 849 P.2d at 152; <em>and Runstrom v. Allen, </em>2008 MT 281, 345 Mont. 314, 191 P.3d 410. In these cases, we have held that the statute of limitations begins to run when a plaintiff discovers or through reasonable diligence should have discovered both (1) the injury; and (2) that the injury \u201cmay have been caused\u201d by the defendant medical provider. <em>Wisher, </em>257 Mont. at 144, 849 P.2d at 159; <em>Major, </em>233 Mont. at 30, 759 P.2d at 156. But the statute of limitations is not tolled until a plaintiff discovers her legal right to bring an action for known injuries. <em>Wisher, </em>257 Mont. at 140, 849 P.2d at <em>157; Major, </em>233 P.2d at 30, 759 P.2d at 156-57. Nor is the statute tolled until a plaintiff \u201clearns the facts out of which a known cause of action arose.\u201d <em>Wisher, </em>257 Mont. at 140, 849 P.2d at 157.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-7\">\u00b620 In <em>Major, </em>the plaintiffs daughter suffered from a form of lupus, which included episodes of throat swelling and breathing difficulty. <em>Major, </em>233 Mont. at 26-27, 759 P.2d at 154. On the day of her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>daughter\u2019s death in March 1982, the plaintiff called the hospital to inform the staff that her daughter\u2019s throat was closing and that she and her daughter were en route from Kalispell to the hospital in Whitefish. <em>Major, </em>233 Mont. at 26, 759 P.2d at 154. Upon their arrival, the hospital staff had not yet called the doctor. <em>Major, </em>233 Mont. at 27, 759 P.2d at 154. The plaintiffs daughter died in the hospital several hours later. <em>Major, </em>233 Mont. at 27, 759 P.2d at 154. The plaintiff consulted with an attorney shortly thereafter, who advised her she should acquire her daughter\u2019s medical records. <em>Major, </em>233 Mont. at 27, 759 P.2d at 154. The plaintiff was unable to acquire the records until October 1984. <em>Major, </em>233 Mont. at 27, 759 P.2d at 154. She filed her complaint in April 1985, more than three years after her daughter\u2019s death. <em>Major, </em>233 Mont. at 27, 759 P.2d at 154. The district court granted summary judgment on the statute of limitations, and we affirmed. The plaintiff argued on appeal that the statute of limitations should have been tolled until she received the medical records and could thus discover the facts that provided \u201ca causal connection between her daughter\u2019s death and the acts, errors, or omissions of her daughter\u2019s health care provider.\u201d <em>Major, </em>233 Mont. at 30, 759 P.2d at 156. After reviewing the record, we rejected her argument and held that the plaintiff s testimony demonstrated that on the day of her daughter\u2019s death, the plaintiff thought her daughter\u2019s treatment was inadequate. <em>Major, </em>233 Mont. at 30, 759 P.2d at 156. We held that under the circumstances, her lack of knowledge of the facts contained in the medical record did not prevent her from discovering the injury at issue in the case. <em>Major, </em>233 Mont. at 30, 759 P.2d at 157.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">\u00b621 In <em>Wisher, </em>the plaintiff underwent left facial nerve decompression surgery to treat Bell\u2019s palsy. <em>Wisher, </em>257 Mont. at 135, 849 P.2d at 153-54. Immediately after surgery she began to have new symptoms of pain, nausea, dizziness, loss of equilibrium, vomiting, and buzzing in her left ear. <em>Wisher, </em>257 Mont. at 135, 849 P.2d at 154. Her surgeon attributed these symptoms to the side effects of anesthesia and a condition called post-operative labyrinthitis. <em>Wisher, </em>257 Mont. at 135, 849 P.2d at 154. The plaintiff s initial symptoms seemed to improve for about two years, but she continued to have problems both related and unrelated to the surgery over the ensuing years. <em>Wisher, </em>257 Mont. at 143, 849 P.2d at 159. Several years and multiple diagnoses later, another doctor discovered that the surgeon had perforated the plaintiff s inner ear during the nerve decompression surgery. <em>Wisher, </em>257 Mont. at 137-38, 849 P.2d at 155. We held that there was no evidence that the plaintiff knew or suspected that she suffered from an injury as a result of her surgery or that she could have discovered this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>through the use of due diligence. <em>Wisher, </em>257 Mont. at 143-44, 849 P.2d at 159. We relied on <em>Johnson </em>and <em>Grey, </em>the cases in which we first enunciated the doctrine of discovery. We distinguished <em>Major, </em>holding that in <em>Major </em>the wrongful act \u201cwas easily identifiable and the injury simultaneous and obvious.\u201d <em>Wisher, </em>257 Mont. at 140, 849 P.2d at 157. We held that substantial evidence did not support the jury verdict that the statute of limitations had run. <em>Wisher, </em>257 Mont. at 144, 849 P.2d at 159.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">\u00b622 In <em>Runstrom, </em>the plaintiffs sixteen-year-old son broke his femur in an all-terrain vehicle accident and died the next day in the hospital. <em>Runstrom, </em>\u00b6 7. The day of his son\u2019s death, the plaintiff requested an autopsy and confronted the doctor because, \u201c[in t loday\u2019.s time, you know, people don\u2019t usually die from a broken leg.\u201d <em>Runstrom, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 7, 33. Within weeks, he obtained his son\u2019s autopsy report and medical records and consulted with an attorney, but no suit was filed at that time. <em>Runstrom, </em>\u00b6 7. Four years later, the local paper ran an article reporting on administrative proceedings regarding the doctor. <em>Runstrom, </em>\u00b6 8. Although his son was not named in the article, the plaintiff believed that his son was one of the unnamed patients discussed in the article. <em>Runstrom, </em>\u00b6 8. Several months after the newspaper article was published, the plaintiff filed a malpractice suit against the doctor. <em>Runstrom, </em>\u00b6 9. The plaintiff argued that he did not discover his son\u2019s injury until he read the newspaper article. <em>Runstrom, </em>\u00b6 34. We rejected this argument because the newspaper article contained no new information. <em>Runstrom, </em>\u00b6 37. The autopsy report and medical records in his possession since shortly after his son\u2019s death contained all of the information upon which the plaintiff later based his medical malpractice suit. <em>Runstrom, </em>\u00b6 37.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">\u00b623 Some of these opinions borrowed language from the non-medical malpractice context to interpret the language of \u00a7 27-2-205, MCA. But despite those references to terms used in the general tort statute, we conclude that both \u00a7 27-2-205, MCA, and our jurisprudence since its enactment accord with our prior medical malpractice case law applying the discovery doctrine when the \u201cpatient does not know of his own condition ... until some time later when he learns of, or in the exercise of reasonable care and diligence he should have learned of it.\u201d <em>Grey, </em>149 Mont. at 216, 425 P.2d at 820. As we noted in <em>Johnson, </em>this may require \u201clookfing] carefully at the facts of each case presented.\u201d <em>Johnson, </em>148 Mont. at 128, 417 P.2d at 470. Summary judgment is proper only when there is no genuine issue of material fact. <em>See </em>M. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(3). When reasonable minds can reach more than one conclusion on the accrual of a plaintiffs claim, a jury may consider the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>nature of the injury and other surrounding circumstances in resolving the factual dispute over discovery.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">\u00b624 Our de novo review of the record reveals the following material facts:</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">\u00b625 Drilling a hole in Wilson\u2019s bone was part of the ACL repair. Wilson was informed of this and consented to it. Wilson testified in her deposition that she had new pain after the ACL surgery. Wilson knew that Dr. Brandt drilled a hole in her knee and that she had pain\u2014a common occurrence after a surgery. She \u201cdidn\u2019t know\u201d if the \u201cpain ... was related to the hole that had been drilled in [her] knee,\u201d in the months after surgery. She stated she did not ask why she was having the new pain because she had had \u201ctwo different types of surgeries, one was more aggressive than the other, like the ACL is more aggressive than the meniscus. And so [she] thought it all joined together.\u201d When asked whether she thought there was something new wrong, she said she was \u201cconcerned\u201d and that she \u201cknew there was something wrong\u201d with her knee during this time. She testified that Dr. Brandt attributed her pain to RSD. Dr. Brandt\u2019s records confirm his impression of RSD and his belief that more surgery was not needed. In Wilson\u2019s submitted affidavit, she attested that she did not know Dr. Brandt \u201cmessed up\u201d until meeting with Dr. Schutte. Even striking any possible hearsay statements from the affidavit, Wilson\u2019s claim of her own personal knowledge and impression after her meeting with Dr. Schutte are consistent with her deposition testimony.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Ak6y\">\u00b626 Tammy Munroe, a friend of Wilson, testified in a deposition that she knew about only two of Wilson\u2019s six knee surgeries. She testified that a month or two after the ACL surgery Wilson told her that the \u201cACL just wasn\u2019t working, and it hurt her a lot.\u201d Munroe said that after the second surgery, when discussing her pain, Wilson \u201cdidn\u2019t tell me different, but she described it different] ly I\u201d from her pain before the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>ACL surgery.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">\u00b627 Another of Wilson\u2019s friends, Shannon Penney, testified in a deposition on November 10, 2016, about Wilson\u2019s knee pain and surgeries. Penney testified that within six months to a year after the ACL surgery, Wilson told Penney that \u201c[s]he knew there just wasn\u2019t something right with her knee after that surgery, and she\u2019d go to doctors, and then they\u2019d send her to physical therapy. And she would constantly say, you know, There\u2019s something wrong. And she\u2019d show me like her knee was indented really weird, just it looked deformed, and it would ache.\u201d When asked when Wilson first thought about hiring an attorney, Penney stated \u201cIt\u2019s\u2014was it four years ago? Five years ago?\u201d When asked how soon after Dr. Brandt\u2019s second surgery Wilson considered hiring an attorney, Penney answered that Wilson was in a lot of pain right after surgery, but \u201cI guess I couldn\u2019t give you an exact time frame, because I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">\u00b628 Wilson\u2019s medical records show that Wilson continued to report pain to her medical providers, including Dr. Brandt, after the surgery. They show that Dr. Brandt diagnosed Wilson with RSD and concluded that it explained the pain she was having. It was not until Wilson\u2019s June 2010 appointment with Dr. Blasingame that Wilson\u2019s pain was attributed to something besides RSD or nerve pain that would burn out.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-7\">\u00b629 Upon review of the full record, we conclude that the material facts are not undisputed that, before June 20, 2009, Wilson both recognized that she was injured and that her injuries may have been caused by Dr. Brandt or, alternatively, that through reasonable diligence she should have discovered her injury and its cause. Rather, there is more than one permissible inference that could be made based on Wilson\u2019s testimony and medical records. From the evidence, we conclude that the finder of fact reasonably could infer that Wilson discovered her injury and that Dr. Brandt\u2019s surgery may have been the cause of that injury soon after the ACL surgery. As in <em>Major, </em>it could be inferred that Wilson\u2019s lack of knowledge of the facts connecting her pain to the aberrant tibial tunnel did not prevent her or should not have prevented her from discovering the injury at issue because she knew that her pain was new and excruciating. But drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of Wilson as the non-moving party, as required in considering a summary judgment motion, we conclude that the finder of fact alternatively could infer that she knew only that she was having pain from her surgeries, but not that the surgeries had injured her or that any new injury may have been caused by Dr. Brandt\u2019s actions. As in <em>Wisher, </em>it could be inferred that Wilson did not and could not discover <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>her injury because pain can be expected after surgery and her symptoms were attributed to another cause.</p>\n<p id=\"Aari\">\u00b630  Thus, more than one inference could be drawn from this evidence about whether Wilson discovered or should have discovered her injury and whether it may have been connected to Dr. Brandt\u2019s actions during this time. Objective evidence supports both inferences. Weighing this evidence and determining when Wilson discovered or reasonably should have discovered her injury is an issue for the jury to decide. <em>See Nelson v. Nelson, </em>2002 MT 151, \u00b6 24, 310 Mont. 329, 50 P.3d 139 (\u201cThe rule in Montana, and in the majority of jurisdictions, is that when there is conflicting evidence as to when a cause of action accrued, the question of whether an action is barred by the statute of limitations is for the jury to decide.\u201d). Based on our review of the record, we conclude that there are questions of material fact about when Wilson was aware of\u2014or should have been aware of\u2014sufficient facts to believe she was injured by Dr. Brandt\u2019s alleged actions during surgery.</p>\n<p id=\"alo-dedup-0\">\u00b631  Just as in <em>Siebken, </em>\u201c[w]e reverse the decision of the District Court not because we conclude [Wilson] did file a timely action, but because we conclude the matter should not have been decided on summary judgment.\u201d <em>Siebken, </em>\u00b6 20. Wilson is entitled to have a jury decide when she discovered or through reasonable diligence should have discovered her injury and that it may have been caused by Dr. Brandt.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-7\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b425-8\">\u00b632 The District Court\u2019s order granting summary judgment is reversed and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this Opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b425-9\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES McKINNON, SANDEFUR and SHEA concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b416-8\"> The statute of limitations is tolled from the filing of an application with the MMLP until 30 days after the panel renders its decision. Section 27-6-702, MCA. Wilson\u2019s statute of limitations was tolled from May 7, 2012, to August 21, 2012, plus 30 days. Taking this tolled period into account, the applicable three-year statute of limitations for Wilson\u2019s complaint filed on November 5, 2012, bars recovery for any injury discovered before June 20, 2009.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b418-7\"> In 2015, the Legislature amended \u00a7 27-2-205, MCA, from 3 years to 2 years. <em>See </em>2015 Mont.

She did not testify that she recognized that she had been injured or that she believed any new injury may have been caused by Dr. Brandt\u2019s actions.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
