We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"A3lr\">\u00b62 Williams presents the following issues for our review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-5\">\n<em>1. Whether the District Court erred in affirming a telephonic search warrant issued pursuant to \u00a7 61-8-402(5), MCA, to draw Williams\u2019s blood.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-6\">\n<em>2. Whether the District Court erred in failing to consider the merits of Williams\u2019s contention that he did not receive the implied consent advisory prior to his blood draw.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b330-7\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b330-8\">\u00b63 On January 24, 2016, at 2:48 a.m., Missoula Police Deputy Jenna Volinkaty (Volinkaty) observed Williams speeding in a rental truck, lose control of the vehicle, collide with a utility pole and tree, and attempt to leave the scene. Using a radar device before the collision, Volinkaty measured Williams traveling between 50 and 55 miles per hour and another officer measured him traveling at 70 miles per hour and accelerating. The speed limit in the area is 30 miles per hour. Volinkaty smelled alcohol on Williams\u2019s breath, saw that his eyes were glassy, watery, and bloodshot, his clothing was soiled, that he could not maintain his balance, and heard Williams slur his words. Volinkaty arrested Williams for suspected DUI. Williams admitted he had consumed alcohol, but refused to take an Intoxilyzer breath test. Volinkaty learned that in 2008, Williams was convicted of an alcohol-related driving offense under Arizona Revised Statute \u00a7 28-1381.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-9\">\u00b64 Volinkaty contacted Judge Marie Anderson to obtain a telephonic search warrant to draw Williams\u2019s blood. In her affidavit, Volinkaty described seeing Williams speeding, travelling 50-55 miles per hour, losing control, and crashing into a utility pole at 2:48 a.m.; Williams being taken into custody after he attempted to flee; observing symptoms of his impairment including watery, bloodshot eyes, slurred speech, staggering movements, soiled clothing, and mood swings. Volinkaty also notified Judge Anderson that \u201cthe suspect has a prior conviction for DUI or substantially similar offense on 11/20/2008 in Arizona.\u201d Judge Anderson authorized the issuance of the search warrant and Volinkaty executed it by having Williams\u2019s blood drawn. Williams had a blood alcohol content (BAC) of 0.197.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-10\">\u00b65 The City of Missoula (the City) charged Williams with aggravated DUI pursuant to \u00a7 61-8-465, MCA; reckless driving pursuant to \u00a7 61-8-301, MCA; and refusing to submit to a blood or breath test pursuant to \u00a7 10.56.020 of the Missoula Municipal Code. Williams filed a motion to suppress the blood draw evidence arguing it was obtained pursuant to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>a search warrant that relied on a previous conviction from Arizona that \u201cdoes not qualify as a \u2018similar\u2019 offense under Section 61-8-402(5).\u201d The Municipal Court denied Williams\u2019s motion to suppress \u201cconcludlingl that the Arizona DUI conviction could be considered a \u2018similar\u2019 offense for purposes of seeking a telephonic search warrant.\u201d In its order, the Municipal Court recognized, however, that under <em>State v. McNally, </em>2002 MT 160, 310 Mont. 396, 50 P.3d 1080, the Arizona conviction could not be used to enhance Williams\u2019s DUI sentence to a felony. Reserving his right to appeal the adverse determination on his motion to suppress, Williams pleaded no contest to aggravated DUI. The City dismissed the remaining two charges. The Municipal Court sentenced Williams to six months in jail with all but five days suspended and imposed a fine of $1,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">\u00b66 Williams appealed the Municipal Court\u2019s order denying his motion to suppress to Montana\u2019s Fourth Judicial District Court, Missoula County, and made an additional argument that \u201cOfficer Volinkaty failed to include in her Affidavit of Probable Cause that she had read to [Williams] the Implied Consent Advisory and therefore information about his refusal is called into question.\u201d The District Court affirmed the Municipal Court\u2019s order denying Williams\u2019s motion to suppress on the same grounds as the Municipal Court, concluding that the Arizona statute is \u201csimilar\u201d to Montana\u2019s DUI statute \u201cfor the purposes of being able to seek a telephonic search warrant under the auspices of Mont. Code Ann. \u00a761-8-402(5).\u201d The District Court declined to address Williams\u2019s additional argument \u201c|b lecause this issue was not previously raised and the municipal court had no opportunity to rule on the issue ....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">\u00b67 Williams appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-7\">STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b331-8\">\u00b68 On appeal from a municipal court, the district court functions as an intermediate appellate court. Sections 3-5-303, 3-6-110, MCA; <em>City of Bozeman v. Cantu, </em>2013 MT 40, \u00b6 10, 369 Mont. 81, 296 P.3d 461. When a district court acts as an intermediate appellate court, \u201c[t]he appeal is confined to review of the record and questions of law, subject to the supreme court\u2019s rulemaking and supervisory authority.\u201d Section 3-6-110(1), MCA. Our review of the case is as if the appeal was originally filed in this Court and we examine the record independently of the district court\u2019s decision. <em>Stanley v. Lemire, </em>2006 MT 304, \u00b6 26, 334 Mont. 489, 148 P.3d 643. This Court reviews a ruling on a motion to suppress evidence to determine whether the court\u2019s findings of fact are clearly erroneous and whether the court\u2019s interpretation and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>application of the law are correct. <em>State v. Marcial, </em>2013 MT 242, \u00b6 10, 371 Mont. 348, 308 P.3d 69. Although we will review the municipal court record as if the appeal was originally filed in this Court, our disposition pertains to the order of the district court from which the appeal is taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">\u00b69 <em>1. Whether the District Court erred in affirming a telephonic search warrant issued pursuant to \u00a7 61-8-402(5), MCA, to draw Williams\u2019s blood.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b332-8\">\u00b610 Williams challenges the legality of the search warrant application that allowed his blood to be drawn. Williams contends on appeal that, under <em>McNally, </em>Arizona and Montana\u2019s DUI statutes are not \u201csimilar\u201d and, without similarity, there was insufficient evidence to authorize a blood draw under \u00a7 61-8-402(5), MCA. Therefore, Williams concludes, \u201cthe search warrant was illegal and the blood draw results should have been suppressed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b332-9\">\u00b611 The City responds that <em>McNally </em>is distinguishable because it addressed \u201csimilarity\u201d for sentencing purposes only, not for obtaining search warrants pursuant to \u00a7 61-8-402(5), MCA. The City also contends, based upon the statutory history of \u00a7 61-8-402(5), MCA, that Arizona and Montana\u2019s DUI statutes are similar. The City concludes that construing Arizona and Montana\u2019s DUI statutes as not similar would frustrate the Legislature\u2019s intent when it authorized the drawing of a person\u2019s blood pursuant to the provisions of \u00a7 61-8-402(5), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-10\">\u00b612 While we ultimately conclude that <em>McNally </em>is not dispositive of the issue before us, some discussion of <em>McNally </em>and its progeny are necessary to understand the legal inquiry required in assessing the similarity of another state\u2019s statutes with ours and whether such an inquiry is appropriate in deciding if a search warrant should issue. The statute at issue in <em>McNally </em>was a sentencing enhancement statute, \u00a7 61-8-734(1)(a), MCA, which elevates a DUI offense to a felony if the offender has three or more prior convictions under certain Montana laws or \u201ca similar statute or regulation in another state.\u201d <em>McNally, </em>\u00b6 11 (quoting \u00a7 61-8-734(1)(a), MCA). McNally was charged with a fourth or subsequent DUI after having previously received four Driving While Ability Impaired (DWAI) convictions in Colorado. <em>McNally, </em>\u00b6 3. Because Colorado law provides a DWAI offense and Montana\u2019s law does not, McNally argued on appeal that his prior convictions for DWAI \u201cdid not constitute previous convictions under a similar statute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>for the purposes of enhancing Count I to Felony DUI under \u00a7 61-8-734, MCA,\u201d and he could, therefore, \u201cbe sentenced only for a first offense DUI, a misdemeanor.\u201d <em>McNally, </em>\u00b6 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">\u00b613 This Court conducted a careful review and comparison of the statutory scheme pertaining to alcohol-related offenses for both Colorado and Montana, which required consideration of the elements and degree of impairment for each state\u2019s respective offenses. We agreed with McNally, differentiating between Colorado\u2019s scheme of alcohol-related driving offenses, which provided for three offenses, DUI, DUI per se, and DWAI, and Montana\u2019s, which only provided for two, DUI and DUI per se. <em>McNally, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 7-10. Reasoning that the standard of impairment contained in Colorado\u2019s DWAI statute, which required impairment only to the \u201cslightest degree,\u201d was lower than the standard of impairment in Montana\u2019s DUI statute requiring the driver\u2019s ability be \u201cdiminished,\u201d we determined \u201cMcNally\u2019s prior convictions in Colorado do not constitute \u2018convictionfs] for a violation of a similar statute ... in another state,\u2019 as required under \u00a7 61-8-734(1)(a),MCA <em>....\u2019\u2019McNally, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 18,22 (quoting \u00a7 61-8-734(l)(a), MCA). \u201c[W]e concludefd] it was error to enhance McNally\u2019s DUI conviction to a felony based on his convictions under Colorado\u2019s DWAI statute.\u201d <em>McNally, </em>\u00b6 23. In sum, <em>McNally </em>held that Colorado\u2019s DWAI statute is not \u201csimilar\u201d to Montana\u2019s DUI statute within the meaning of \u00a7 61-8-734(1)(a), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">\u00b614 The Montana Legislature has also utilized the language, \u201csimilar statute,\u201d relative to requirements for obtaining blood or breath tests where probable cause exists to suspect impaired driving. We begin with Montana\u2019s statutory presumption of implied consent that \u201c[a] person who operates or is in actual physical control of a vehicle upon ways of this state open to the public is considered to have given consent to a test or tests of the person\u2019s blood or breath for the purpose of determining any measured amount or detected presence of alcohol or drugs in the person\u2019s body.\u201d Section 61-8-402(1), MCA. However, if an arrested person refuses to supply a BAC sample, the \u201crefused test or tests may not be given.\u201d Section 61-8-402(4), MCA. Section 61-8-402(5), MCA, carves out an exception to this rule:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-7\">If the arrested person has refused to provide a breath, blood, or urine sample under 61-8-409 or this section in a prior investigation in this state or under a substantially similar statute in another jurisdiction or the arrested person has a prior conviction or pending offense for a violation of45-5-104 [negligent homicide], 45-5-106 [vehicular homicide while under the influence], 45-5-205 [negligent vehicular assault], 61-8-401 [DUI], <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>61-8-406 [DUI per se], or 61-8-411 [operating a vehicle under the influence of THC] or a similar statute in another jurisdiction, the officer may apply for a search warrant to be issued pursuant to 46-5-224 to collect a sample of the person\u2019s blood for testing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">\u00b615 The Legislature added \u00a7 61-8-402(5), MCA, in 2011. Prior to its inclusion, the statute \u201cdid not permit law enforcement to apply for a search warrant in DUI cases if an arrested person refused to submit to BAC testing.\u201d <em>State v. Giacomini, </em>2014 MT 93, \u00b6 10, 374 Mont. 412, 327 P.3d 1054. If an arrested person refused to submit to a blood or breath test \u201cthe refused test or tests [could] not be given ....\u201d Section 61-8-402(4), MCA (2009). A blood sample could only be taken pursuant to a search warrant if probable cause existed that an offense other than the underlying DUI had occurred. <em>Giacomini, </em>\u00b6 10 (citing <em>Collins v. Dep\u2019t of Justice, Div. of Highway Patrol, </em>232 Mont. 73, 78, 755 P.2d 1373, 1376 (1988)). The statutory framework was revised in 2011 by the Legislature\u2019s passage of Senate Bill 42, which authorized law enforcement to apply for a search warrant for a blood draw where an arrested person refused to submit to BAC testing and had a prior conviction for any of the listed driving, alcohol-related driving, or drug-related driving offenses <em>\u201cor a similar statute in another jurisdiction.\u201d </em>The amended bill was explained by a proponent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-6\">The question is: What do you do with these people who have figured out the game? That is\u2014\u201cIf I refuse, they don\u2019t have the evidence.\u201d And you notice that the committee amended the bill for the repeat offenders just for that reason. Because there was a general idea that we shouldn\u2019t do it for the first refusal. And what we got here is a bill to try to compel the person that fits the profile of the repeater to give evidence .... When you tell them \u201cYou either give us a breath test or we go to the judge and get a warrant [for your blood,]\u201d they\u2019re going to give you a breath test and that is the object of the exercise.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b334-7\">\u00b616 This Court addressed a challenge to \u00a7 61-8-402(5), MCA, in <em>Giacomini. </em>Giacomini refused to submit to a breath test requested during a traffic stop. <em>Giacomini, </em>\u00b6 4. Because Giacomini had refused to provide a BAC test in the past, law enforcement applied for and received a warrant to draw his blood pursuant to \u00a7 61-8-402(5), MCA. <em>Giacomini, </em>\u00b6 5. On appeal, Giacomini argued that \u201chis prior refusal of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>a breath test [was] insufficient to establish probable cause to support a search warrant to draw his blood.\u201d <em>Giacomini, </em>\u00b6 12. In response, we noted that \u201c[t]he revisions made to \u00a7 61-8-402, MCA, by Senate Bill 42 merely removed the statutory prohibition on seeking a search warrant for a blood draw ....\u201d <em>Giacomini, </em>\u00b6 13. We explained that an arrested person\u2019s prior refusal does not by itself establish the necessary probable cause for a warrant, \u201cbut merely permits police to apply for a warrant\u201d under \u00a7 61-8-402(5), MCA. <em>Giacomini, </em>\u00b6 13. Aside from his prior refusal, there was a substantial basis to support the judge\u2019s determination that probable cause existed in Giacomini\u2019s case, including that he had driven the wrong way down a one-way street; had watery, bloodshot eyes; smelled like alcohol; swayed and staggered; and performed poorly on standard field sobriety tests. <em>Giacomini, </em>\u00b6 13. Section 61-8-402(5), MCA, does not supply probable cause, but allows a mechanism to gather evidence against those who have either refused a test in the past or been charged with or convicted of various, but specifically enumerated offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">\u00b617 Here, Williams contends <em>McNally </em>is not limited to sentencing and asserts that \u201cItlhere is no meaningful distinction between the sentencing enhancement statute [\u00a7 61-8-734(1), MCA,] and the telephonic search warrant application statute [\u00a7 61-8-402(5), MCA]....\u201d Pointing out that both Arizona and Colorado\u2019s DWAI statutes include a threshold level of impairment described as to the \u201cslightest degree,\u201d Williams argues that Arizona and Colorado\u2019s DWAI statutes are the same and, based on our holding in <em>McNally, </em>neither is similar to Montana\u2019s DUI statute, which requires a driver\u2019s ability to be \u201cdiminished.\u201d Williams urges us to expand <em>McNally </em>and hold that because Montana\u2019s DUI statute is not similar to Colorado\u2019s DWAI statute, within the meaning of \u00a7 61-8-734(1), MCA, Montana\u2019s DUI statute is also not similar to Arizona\u2019s DWAI statute, within the meaning of \u00a7 61-8-402(5), MCA. While it is true that both statutes require convictions for \u201csimilar\u201d offenses in order to justify either an enhanced sentence or the taking of a person\u2019s blood, significant to resolving the underlying issue are well-established principles for reviewing the sufficiency of a search warrant application, which remain distinguishable from review of predicate convictions for purposes of sentencing and other aspects of the criminal trial. Hence, when reviewing the issuance of a search warrant pursuant to \u00a7 61-8-402(5), MCA, it is unnecessary for this Court to determine whether Arizona and Montana have \u201csimilar\u201d DUI statutes as we did in <em>McNally. </em>Such an inquiry, which is entirely a question of law, is beyond review of the \u201cfacts\u201d set forth within the four corners of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>application and otherwise necessary for a determination of probable cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">\u00b618 Probable cause is required for a judge to issue a search warrant.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"aau-dedup-0\">A judge shall issue a search warrant to a person upon application ... made under oath or affirmation, that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-6\">(1) states facts sufficient to support probable cause to believe that an offense has been committed;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-7\">(2) states facts sufficient to support probable cause to believe that evidence, contraband, or persons connected with the offense may be found;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-8\">(3) particularly describes the place, object, or persons to be searched; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-9\">(4) particularly describes who or what is to be seized.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b336-10\">Section 46-5-221, MCA. This Court follows the \u201ctotality of the circumstances\u201d test set forth in <em>Illinois v. Gates, </em>462 U.S. 213, 103 S. Ct. 2317 (1983). <em>State v. Reesman, </em>2000 MT 243, \u00b6 24, 301 Mont. 408, 10 P.3d 83; <em>overruled on other grounds by State v. Barnaby, </em>2006 MT 203, \u00b6 42, 333 Mont. 220, 142 P.3d 809. Under this test, to determine if a search warrant should be issued, the judge evaluates the facts asserted within the four corners of the warrant application and makes a practical, common sense determination whether there is a fair probability that incriminating items will be found in the place to which entry is sought.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Reesman, </em>\u00b6 24 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b336-11\">\u00b619 Williams does not dispute that he was convicted under Arizona Revised Statute \u00a7 28-1381 or argue that there were insufficient facts to demonstrate probable cause he was driving while impaired. Nor does Williams dispute the validity of Volinkaty\u2019s observations. Williams\u2019s entire argument is based upon Volinkaty\u2019s inclusion in the affidavit of his prior Arizona conviction, which he maintains is not similar to any statute in Montana. Williams thus presents a challenge to the validity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>of Volinkaty\u2019s affidavit. We adopted the <em>Franks </em>procedure for challenging the validity of a warrant affidavit in <em>State v. Sykes, </em>194 Mont. 14, 20, 663 P.2d 691, 695 (1983); <em>overruled on other grounds by State v. Long, </em>216 Mont. 65, 69, 700 P.2d 153, 156 (1985). \u201c[A] warrant affidavit must set forth particular facts and circumstances underlying the existence of probable cause, so as to allow the magistrate to make an independent evaluation of the matter.\u201d <em>Franks v. Delaware, </em>438 U.S. 154, 165, 98 S. Ct. 2674, 2681 (1978). \u201cThere is, of course, a presumption of validity with respect to the affidavit supporting the search warrant.\u201d <em>Franks, </em>438 U.S. at 171, 98 S. Ct. at 2684. A \u201cjudge or magistrate is required to evaluate only the facts asserted within the four corners of a search warrant application. If inaccurate or misleading information is included in that application, it must be excised from the application regardless of whether that information was included mistakenly, negligently, or intentionally.\u201d <em>State v. Worrall, </em>1999 MT 55 \u00b6 33, 293 Mont. 439, 976 P.2d 968 (citation omitted); <em>overruled on other grounds by State v. Kasparek, </em>2016 MT 163, \u00b6 12, 384 Mont. 56, 375 P.3d 372. \u201cThis Court\u2019s only function is to ensure that the issuing judicial officer had a substantial basis to determine that probable cause existed\u201d and we pay great deference to a magistrate\u2019s determination. <em>State v. Estes, </em>2017 MT 226, \u00b6 24, 388 Mont. 491, 403 P.3d 1249 (citation omitted). \u201cWhen the issuance of a search warrant is based in part on illegal information, the reviewing court shall excise the illegally obtained information from the application for search warrant and review the remaining information de novo to determine whether probable cause supported the issuance of a search warrant.\u201d <em>Estes, </em>\u00b6 24 (citation omitted). Significantly, \u00a7 61-8-402(5), MCA, does not alter how search warrants are to be issued and reviewed.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">\u00b620 Our review, and that of the issuing judge, is constrained to the facts within the four corners of the affidavit and we decline to conduct a legal inquiry into the similarity of Montana\u2019s statutes with those of Arizona. At a minimum, such an inquiry would require consideration of information not within the application and beyond the requirements for establishing probable cause. <em>See Reesman, </em>\u00b6 24; \u00a7 46-5-221, MCA. Williams\u2019s contention is based on a conclusion of law reached after conducting a legal analysis of the alcohol-related statutory schemes in Arizona, Colorado, and Montana, as well as specific statutory elements. The determination of whether two statutes are \u201csimilar\u201d is not informed by facts contained within the affidavit which were observed by the officer in the commission of the alcohol-related offense and any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>inquiry of statutory similarity for purposes of \u00a7 61-8-402(5), MCA, which is beyond the affiant\u2019s averment that they are similar, is outside the four corners of the affidavit and unnecessary. Here, Volinkaty represented under oath that Williams had a prior conviction \u201cfor a DUI or substantially similar offense on 11/20/2008 in Arizona.\u201d Neither Volinkaty nor Judge Anderson is compelled to conduct an exhaustive legal analysis into \u201csimilarity\u201d of the statutes in order to meet the requirements of \u00a7 61-8-402(5), MCA, for issuance of a search warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"agq-dedup-1\">\u00b621 Finally, we would be remiss if we failed to note that conducting such an analysis would place an impractical or impossible burden on police officers and issuing judges prior to applying for or issuing a search warrant. Such a requirement would be time consuming and DUI investigations are time-sensitive by nature because the evidence of the offense metabolizes out of the driver\u2019s bloodstream simply by the passage of time. We are also confident that if the Legislature is dissatisfied with our interpretation made here, it will exercise its authority and determine otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"AWZ\">\u00b622  We conclude that conducting a \u201csimilarity\u201d analysis of Arizona and Montana DUI statutes\u2014a question purely of law\u2014would go beyond the four corners of the affidavit. In the absence of inaccurate, misleading, or illegally obtained information, it was unnecessary to excise from the affidavit Volinkaty\u2019s representations that Williams had a prior conviction in Arizona for DUI. The District Court did not err in denying Williams\u2019s motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">\u00b623 <em>2. Whether the District Court erred in failing to consider the merits of Williams\u2019s contention that he did not receive the implied consent advisory prior to his blood draw.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b338-7\">\u00b624 Williams argues generally that the warrant requirements were not met and that the City failed to demonstrate that they were met. Williams more specifically argues that Volinkaty failed to read the implied consent advisory. This failure, Williams argues, is fatal to the search warrant application\u2019s validity. Williams also faults the District Court for failing to address this argument. The City responds that Williams failed to raise this issue in the Municipal Court and that issues raised for the first time on appeal are not addressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-8\">\u00b625 Those who operate a motor vehicle in the state of Montana have impliedly consented to submit to a blood or breath test for the purpose of determining the presence or amount of alcohol or drugs in their body. Section 61-8-402(1), MCA. \u201c[D]ue process requires that the arresting officer inform the accused of his or her right to obtain an independent blood test, regardless of whether the accused consents to the test designated by the officer.\u201d <em>State v.

The reason for the rule is that it is fundamentally unfair to fault the trial court for failing to rule on an issue it was never given the opportunity to consider.\u201d <em>State v. Gomez, </em>2007 MT 111, \u00b6 21, 337 Mont. 219, 158 P.3d 442 (quotation and citations omitted). When the district court acted as an intermediate appellate court, we review the case as if the appeal was originally filed in this Court, examining the record independently of the district court\u2019s decision. <em>Stanley, </em>\u00b6 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">\u00b627 Our review of the record reveals the only issue raised in the Municipal Court was whether \u201cthe blood evidence obtained pursuant to the search warrant should be suppressed because [Williams\u2019s] previous conviction from Arizona does not qualify as a \u2018similar\u2019 offense under Section 61-8-402(5).\u201d It is clear from the briefing in the Municipal Court, that the parties agreed that the implied consent advisory had been given. Both parties referred to Volinkaty providing an implied consent advisory to Williams prior to his refusing to provide a BAC sample. We conclude that whether Volinkaty supplied the implied consent advisory was not at issue in the Municipal Court and the District Court correctly declined to address the matter. For the same reason, we also decline to address Williams\u2019s contention that the search warrant is invalid because Volinkaty failed to give him the implied consent advisory.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-7\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b339-8\">\u00b628 The decision of the District Court affirming the Municipal Court\u2019s denial of Williams\u2019s motion to suppress is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b339-9\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES SHEA and BAKER concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b334-8\"><em> Authorize Warrants to Obtain Blood or Breath Test in DUI Cases, </em>Second Reading of Senate Bill 42, 62nd Leg., at 1:24:30-1:25:23 (2011) (statement of Sen.

Probable cause, the standard upon which a search warrant may issue, is lower than a preponderance of the evidence, the standard required to establish the existence of prior convictions. Furthermore, probable cause is a less onerous standard than determining whether a prior conviction from a different state was pursuant to a \u201csimilar statute\u201d for sentencing enhancement purposes. This Court will review a district court\u2019s determinations of similarity to determine if its conclusions of law were correct as a matter of law.

Thus, I concur that the Municipal Court did not err in denying Williams\u2019 motion to suppress the blood alcohol content (BAC) evidence obtained by the Missoula Police pursuant to a post-refusal DUI search warrant. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>However, I disagree that the validity of the Municipal Court\u2019s search warrant depends on compliance with \u00a7 61-8-402(5), MCA, and that the warrant application complied with the similarity requirement of \u00a7 61-8-402(5), MCA. Rather than attempt to shoehorn the warrant into \u00a7 61-8-402(5), MCA, I instead would affirm on the alternative basis that, regardless of whether Williams\u2019 prior Arizona DUI conviction occurred under a legal standard of liability similar to \u00a7\u00a7 61-8-401 and -406, MCA, the Municipal Court lawfully issued the search warrant on probable cause of DUI as independently authorized by \u00a7 46-5-221, MCA (general authorization for issuance of search warrants on probable cause of criminal activity).</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">\u00b630 Standing impassably in the path of affirming the Municipal Court\u2019s search warrant under \u00a7 61-8-402(5), MCA, is the express statutory requirement that Williams must have had a prior Arizona DUI conviction under a legal standard of liability \u201csimilar\u201d to \u00a7\u00a7 61-8-401 and -406, MCA (Montana DUI and DUI <em>perse). See </em>\u00a7 61-8-402(5), MCA. Unlike the Colorado statutes at issue in <em>McNally, </em>which had three different classes of DUI offenses,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Montana and Arizona have only two base DUI offenses\u2014DUI and DUI <em>per se. See </em>\u00a7\u00a7 61-8-401(1)(a), (3), and -406(1)(a), MCA; Ariz. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 28-1381(A)(1) and (2). While Arizona and Montana similarly define DUI <em>per se, see </em>\u00a7 61-8-406(1)(a), MCA (driving or being in actual physical control of a noncommercial vehicle with BAC of 0.08 or more), and Ariz. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 28-1381(A)(2) (driving or being in actual physical control of a vehicle with an \u201calcohol concentration of 0.08 or more\u201d), Arizona defines alcohol-based DUI more broadly than \u00a7 61-8-401(1)(a) and (3), MCA (driving or being in actual physical control of a vehicle when person\u2019s \u201cability to safely operate a vehicle has been diminished\u201d by alcohol intake). <em>Compare </em>Ariz. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 28-1381(A)(1) (driving or being \u201cin actual physical control of a vehicle ... [wjhile under the influence of an intoxicating liquor ... if the person is impaired to the slightest degree\u201d). <em>See also State v. Miller, </em>245 P.3d 454, \u00b6 7 (Ariz. App. 2011) (construing Arizona DUI definition). The Arizona \u201cimpaired to the slightest degree\u201d standard requires proof of a lesser degree of impairment than \u00a7 61-8-401, MCA (diminished \u201cability to safely operate a vehicle\u201d). A person who commits the offense of DUI under Arizona law does not necessarily commit the offense of DUI under \u00a7 61-8-401, MCA. Consequently, the State inaccurately represented in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>the search warrant application that Williams had a prior DUI conviction under a standard of criminal liability \u201csimilar\u201d to \u00a7\u00a7 61-8-401 and -406, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">\u00b631 As recognized by the Court, the mechanism for judicial review of the sufficiency of a search warrant application is our constitutionally-mandated <em>Worrall </em>standard of review requiring excise of inaccurate or misleading factual statements set forth in the original search warrant application and then reassessment of whether what remains is sufficient to establish probable cause for issuance of the warrant. <em>Worrall, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 32-33 (adopting Montana constitutional standard more stringent than federal <em>Franks </em>standard). If what remains in original application is not sufficient to establish the necessary probable cause, the reviewing court must void the warrant and suppress the fruits of the search. <em>Worrall, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 32-33.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">\u00b632 If, as the Court implies, the validity of the Municipal Court\u2019s search warrant depends on \u00a7 61-8-402(5), MCA, I would extend and similarly apply our <em>Worrall </em>standard not only to the constitutionally-required probable cause review of search warrant applications but also to review of the accuracy of the statutorily-required assertion in a search warrant application under \u00a7 61-8-402(5), MCA, that the suspect had a prior DUI conviction under a standard of criminal liability similar to \u00a7\u00a7 61-8-401 and -406, MCA. Under <em>Worrall, </em>lower court findings of fact would continue to be subject to a clearly erroneous standard of review, but the related question arising under \u00a7 61-8-402(5), MCA, of whether a statute from another jurisdiction imposes a standard of criminal liability \u201csimilar\u201d to \u00a7\u00a7 61-8-401 and -406, MCA, would be a pure question of law necessarily subject to de novo review for correctness. Here, straightforward application of our <em>Worrall </em>standard would result in the unavoidable conclusion that the search warrant application inaccurately represented that Williams had a prior Arizona DUI conviction under a standard of legal liability similar to \u00a7\u00a7 61-8-401 and -406, MCA. The required excision of that inaccurate information would then require invalidation of the warrant and suppression of the resulting BAC evidence due to non-compliance with the express similarity requirement of \u00a7 61-8-402(5), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-7\">\u00b633 The Court\u2019s analysis avoids application of our <em>Worrall </em>standard, and with it any meaningful review of the State\u2019s compliance with \u00a7 61-8-402(5), MCA. The Court correctly begins with the proposition that judicial review of the sufficiency of a search warrant application is limited to review of the information within the four corners of the application. But the analysis goes awry when it asserts that application of our <em>Worrall </em>standard to the similarity requirement of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>\u00a7 61-8-402(5), MCA, would improperly call for a conclusion of law dependent on extrinsic legal analysis beyond the four corners of the search warrant application. The Court\u2019s reasoning overlooks the fact that <em>Worrall </em>allows, if not necessarily requires, consideration of extrinsic information as a basis to assess the truth and accuracy of the information set forth within the four corners of the application. Regardless of whether the predicate information involves a matter of fact or matter of law, the critical focus of our <em>Worrall </em>standard of review is whether the predicate information alleged by the State as the legal justification for issuance of a search warrant is true and accurate. The purported \u201cimpractical or impossible\u201d time-consuming \u201cburden on police officers and issuing judges,\u201d <em>of verifying the accuracy of a sworn representation in a search warrant application, </em>has no bearing whatsoever on the critical question of whether the court issued the warrant based on accurate information required by law.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">\u00b634 Neither the obvious public policy importance of effective DUI investigation and prosecution, nor the practical inconvenience of requiring law enforcement to comply with a legal requirement imposed by the Legislature, have any proper place in the construction of the clear and unambiguous similarity requirement of \u00a7 61-8-402(5), MCA. If, as the Court implies, the validity of DUI-related search warrants necessarily depends on compliance with \u00a7 61-8-402(5), MCA, the sky will not fall and cripple DUI investigations if the State has to provide accurate information to comply with the statutory similarity requirement. Montana law enforcement officers have, or should have, 24/7 legal support from state and local prosecutors as needed. As Montana\u2019s chief law enforcement officer, the Attorney General certainly has the resources and expertise to support law enforcement and local prosecutors by surveying and publishing the various comparative standards of DUI-related liability in other jurisdictions. Finally, any law enforcement problem caused by compliance with \u00a7 61-8-402(5), MCA, is the sole responsibility of the Legislature, not this Court. Accordingly, I respectfully disagree with the Court\u2019s stated rationale for upholding the validity of the search warrant in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"Al1-\">\u00b635 Proper resolution of this case merely requires recognition of the independent availability of unrestricted DUI-related search warrants under \u00a7 46-5-221, MCA. Prior to 2011, Montana law did not specifically provide for DUI-related search warrants. The two primary legal means available to law enforcement to obtain DUI-related BAC evidence were:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aa7m\">(1) voluntary consent of the person to the implied consent request of a law enforcement officer for a preliminary breath test in the field on reasonable suspicion of a DUI-related offense, \u00a7 61-8-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>409(4), MCA, and/or a more precise breath or blood test following the person\u2019s arrest on probable cause of a DUI-related offense, \u00a7 61-8-402(4), MCA; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-5\">(2) involuntary seizure and scientific analysis (search) of a person\u2019s blood upon a search warrant issued pursuant to \u00a7 46-5-221, MCA, on probable cause of criminal activity, whether DUI or non-DUI-related, and the presence of particularly described related evidence or contraband at or in a particularly described location.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">As to the latter, unrestricted search warrants have always been available to law enforcement \u201con probable cause to believe that <em>an offense </em>has been committed\u201d and that \u201cevidence ... connected with the offense may be found.\u201d Section 46-5-221, MCA (emphasis added).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> As defined by \u00a7\u00a7 61-8-401 and -406, MCA, DUI and DUI <em>per se </em>are \u201coffenses\u201d as referenced in \u00a7 46-5-221, MCA. <em>See </em>\u00a7 46-1-202(15), MCA (definition of \u201coffense\u201d). Even before the 2011 Legislature expressly clarified the matter in \u00a7 46-5-224(1), MCA (specifically including detectable BAC in preexisting authorization for seizure of \u201cevidence\u201d by warrant), measurable BAC has always been \u201cevidence connected with\u201d DUI-related offenses for purposes of \u00a7 46-5-221, MCA. <em>See </em>\u00a7\u00a7 26-1-101(2), 46-5-224(1), and 61-8-404(1)(a), MCA. Fifty years ago, the 1967 Legislature broadly crafted \u00a7 46-5-224, MCA, to \u201cset out <em>as expansively as possible </em>the items which may be seized under a search warrant.\u201d <em>State v. Quigg, </em>155 Mont. 119, 129, 467 P.2d 692, 697-98 (1970) (quoting Criminal Law Commission Comments) (emphasis added); 1967 Mont. Laws 372.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-7\">\u00b636 In various forms since original enactment in 1971, Montana\u2019s primary implied consent statute has allowed DUI suspects to refuse to submit to warrantless implied consent BAC tests subject only to temporary loss of driving privileges upon refusal. <em>See </em>\u00a7 61-8-402(4), MCA. From 1971 through 1995, \u00a7 61-8-402, MCA<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> provided that, if an arrested person \u201crefuses ... to submit\u201d to a warrantless implied consent test, \u201cnone shall be given.\u201d Section 61-8-402(3), MCA (1995); 1971 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>Mont. Laws 640. From 1997 to date, \u00a7 61-8-402, MCA, has similarly provided that, if a person \u201crefuses ... to submit\u201d to a warrantless implied consent test, \u201c <em>the refused test ... may not be given.\u201d </em>Section 61-8-402(4), MCA; 1997 Mont. Laws 492.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> This clear and unequivocally plain limiting language in Montana\u2019s implied consent statutes has always applied only to the <em>warrantless </em>post-refusal BAC tests authorized by the statutes. The plain language of Montana\u2019s implied consent statutes has never barred or otherwise limited warrant-authorized seizures and searches of DUI-related blood samples under the independent authority of \u00a7 46-5-221, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">\u00b637 Nonetheless, despite clear and unequivocal statutory language to the contrary, widespread misconception has long existed that the limiting language of \u00a7\u00a7 61-8-402(4) and -409(4), MCA, not only barred warrantless post-refusal DUI-related seizures of BAC evidence but also warrant-authorized DUI-related seizures.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The long-standing misconception stems from a too cursory and undiscerning analysis of our decision in <em>Collins v. Montana Dept. of Justice, </em>232 Mont. 73, 755 P.2d 1373 (1988). In the anomalous context of a civil assault and battery action against an investigating Montana Highway Patrol officer and the State, we considered whether the limiting language \u00a7 61-8-402(3), MCA (1983), barred post-refusal, warrant-authorized blood seizures as the lynchpin for determining whether the officer and the State had qualified immunity from the plaintiff s civil assault and battery claims. <em>Collins, </em>232 Mont. at 77-78, 755 P.2d at 1375-76. Whether the limiting language in \u00a7 61-8-402(3), MCA (1983), barred post-refusal, warrant-authorized, DUI-related seizure of BAC evidence was not squarely at issue. Rather, <em>based on the State\u2019s concession, </em>we assumed, without analysis, that \u00a7 61-8-402(3), MCA (1983), barred post-refusal DUI-related search warrants. Based on that uncontested assumption, we merely held that the district court erroneously denied qualified immunity to the officer and State because the limiting language in the implied consent statute in any event did not bar warrant-authorized post-refusal blood seizures <em>based on non-DUI-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number><em>related offenses. Collins, </em>232 Mont. at 77-78, 755 P.2d at 1375-76.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In 2014, we perpetuated the misconception by cursorily stating, without analysis, that the limiting language in the pre-2011 implied consent statute \u201cdid not permit law enforcement to apply for a search warrant in DUI cases if an arrested person refused to submit to BAC testing.\u201d <em>Giacomini, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 10-11 (citing <em>Collins, </em>232 Mont. at 78, 755 P.2d at 1376).</p>\n<p id=\"Arnz\">\u00b638 However, upon our first opportunity to squarely construe the meaning of the limiting language in \u00a7 61-8-402(4), MCA, we clarified that our contrary statement in <em>Giacomini </em>was mere dicta and held that the still-present limiting language in \u00a7 61-8-402(4), MCA, applies only to <em>warrantless </em>post-refusal BAC tests, not DUI-related blood draws independently authorized by search warrant. <em>State v. Minett, </em>2014 MT 225, \u00b6\u00b6 12-17, 376 Mont. 260, 332 P.3d 235. Though the case did not involve a search warrant issued after an implied consent refusal, <em>Minett </em>remains important here because our plain meaning construction of the limiting language of \u00a7 61-8-402(4), MCA, did not depend on the presence or absence of an implied consent refusal. <em>See Minett, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 12-17. <em>Minett </em>merely recognized what should have been obvious all along\u2014the limiting language of \u00a7 61-8-402(4), MCA, expressly applies only to warrantless post-refusal DUI-related seizures of BAC evidence. Consequently, contrary to the longstanding misconception and our now superseded dicta in <em>Giacomini, </em>DUI-related search warrants have always been, and remain, available to law enforcement under the general authority of \u00a7 46-5-221, MCA, without any requirement for a prior DUI conviction or implied consent refusal. The only question is whether, in enacting Senate Bill 42, the 2011 Legislature in any way limited the preexisting availability of DUI-related search warrants under the independent authority of \u00a7 46-5-221, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">\u00b639 In a well-intentioned effort to enhance effective enforcement of Montana\u2019s DUI laws by closing a <em>misperceived loophole protecting DUI-related offenders, </em>the 2011 Legislature revised Montana\u2019s implied consent statutes to expressly make post-refusal search warrants <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>available to law enforcement to obtain otherwise unavailable BAC evidence against repeat DUI offenders. Section 61-8-402(5), MCA; 2011 Mont. Laws 1164. The new provision defined a repeat DUI offender as a person who has a prior DUI-related conviction or implied consent refusal under Montana law \u201cor a similar statute in another jurisdiction.\u201d Section \u00a7 61-8-402(5), MCA. Given the Legislature\u2019s narrow focus on repeat offenders and the widespread misconception that Montana\u2019s existing implied consent statutes barred law enforcement from obtaining post-refusal DUI-related search warrants, it is not surprising that nothing in the express language, title, or legislative history of Senate Bill 42 evinces any legislative intent to affirmatively limit the <em>preexisting </em>availability of DUI-related search warrants under \u00a7 46-5-221, MCA. The new warrant exception, \u00a7 61-8-402(5), MCA, and accompanying amendments to \u00a7\u00a7 61-8-402(4) and -409(4), MCA, make sense only under the then-prevailing misconception that the preexisting implied consent statutes barred both warrantless <em>and </em>warrant-authorized post-refusal seizures of BAC evidence. Regardless of the Legislature\u2019s clear intent to limit the availability of the <em>new warrant </em>authorization,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> legislation enacted to partially plug a perceived loophole in DUI enforcement cannot logically be construed as legislative intent to affirmatively limit an independently available, preexisting search warrant authorization the Legislature did not believe existed. Though certainly creating unnecessary ambiguity between statutes, the 2011 revisions to \u00a7 61-8-402, MCA, simply did not supersede, limit, or otherwise affect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>the preexisting availability of DUI-related search warrants under \u00a7 46-5-221, MCA. Thus, unrestricted DUI-related search warrants remain available to law enforcement under \u00a7 46-5-221, MCA, unaffected by the limiting language in \u00a7 61-8-402(5), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">\u00b640 In the continuing absence of any statutory provision handcuffing law enforcement by clearly and unequivocally limiting the longstanding independent availability of unrestricted DUI-related search warrants under \u00a7 46-5-221, MCA, I would hold that, regardless of the inaccurate statement in the warrant application that Williams had a prior out-of-state DUI conviction under a statute similar to \u00a7\u00a7 61-8-401 or -406, MCA, the Missoula Police lawfully seized his blood pursuant to a post-refusal search warrant properly issued by the Municipal Court in accordance with the independent authority of \u00a7 46-5-221, MCA.

The non-DUI-related \u201coffense\u201d was merely a suspected violation of an alcohol restriction imposed as a condition of the DUI suspect\u2019s preexisting probation and, thus, beyond the scope of officer\u2019s duty to investigate and enforce absent prior authorization of the suspect\u2019s probation officer. <em>See </em>\u00a7 46-1-202(15) and (17), MCA (definitions of an \u201coffense\u201d and \u201cpeace officer\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b346-5\"> Under the misconception that DUI-related search warrants were not then available under existing law, and consistent with the express limiting language in the proposed new section, \u00a7 61-8-402(5), MCA, the sponsor of SB 42, Sen. Jim Shockley, explained to the House Judiciary Committee that the <em>new warrant </em>authorization would be available only upon a second or subsequent DUI offense or implied consent refusal, to wit:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-6\">[R]ight now, the way that the statutes are written, you cannot get a warrant from a court to draw blood from a suspect who the officer believes is impaired by alcohol or drugs.... What this does provide is a constitutional way for law enforcement to conduct a search to gather evidence against a person believed to have committed a crime.... [But] there\u2019s a mulligan. I don\u2019t golf, but I understand that if you golf and you mess up the first shot ... it doesn\u2019t count. And that\u2019s what this is, a mulligan. This bill does not apply, you can\u2019t get a warrant, unless the person has refused to cooperate with law enforcement before, refused to either blow or give blood, or has a ... previous DUI, or is awaiting trial on DUI. In other words, this is the second mistake.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b346-7\"><em>Hearing on S.B. 42, House Jud. Comm., 62nd Leg. Reg.
