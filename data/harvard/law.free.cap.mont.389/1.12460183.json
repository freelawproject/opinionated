We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-10\">\u00b62 We restate the issue on appeal as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b28-11\"><em>Did the District Court err when it denied defendant\u2019s motion to </em>suppress?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b28-13\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b28-14\">\u00b63 On July 25, 2015, Kittrell Saunders (Saunders), a waitress, called 911 to report a drunk individual driving away from a restaurant. Saunders called 911 while a coworker, Justin Sharbono (Sharbono), watched the individual leave the restaurant, get in his vehicle, and drive away. Saunders reported her first and last name, the location of where she was calling from, her place of employment, a make, model, and license plate number of the vehicle, as well as the location of travel. Saunders reported Sharbono\u2019s name and that they were both willing to sign a complaint about what they witnessed. Saunders spoke with both the 911 operator and Sharbono simultaneously. Saunders informed dispatch that the man was \u201cwalking into stuff, and he was going all over the place. He couldn\u2019t walk in a straight line to save his life, and then he got in the, stumbled around and got in the vehicle.\u201d Sharbono, while not the caller, could be heard by the dispatcher say, \u201che just bounced off that wall.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b28-15\">\u00b64 Montana Highway Patrol Trooper Luke Burson was on patrol in the area when he received the report from dispatch. Eleven minutes after the initial report, Trooper Burson located the van in a hotel parking lot. He observed the vehicle drive from the check-in area to a spot in the parking lot. Trooper Burson activated his lights and made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>contact with the driver, Nelson. Trooper Burson conducted a driving under the influence (DUI) investigation after he smelled alcohol on Nelson. Trooper Burson arrested Nelson for DUI.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-5\">\u00b65 On July 25, 2015, the Missoula County attorney charged Nelson with DUI. In the Justice Court, Nelson filed a motion to suppress evidence of the stop based on Trooper Burson\u2019s lack of particularized suspicion based on an informant\u2019s tip. The State responded and an evidentiary hearing was held. The Justice Court granted Nelson\u2019s motion. The State appealed to the District Court, which reviewed the issue de novo. Nelson filed a motion to suppress, again arguing particularized suspicion did not exist and the <em>\u201cPratt factors\u201d </em>were not met in order to create particularized suspicion based on Saunders\u2019 and Sharbono\u2019s report. The State responded and the District Court held an evidentiary hearing on May 9,2016. Saunders, Sharbono, and Trooper Burson testified at the hearing. The District Court denied Nelson\u2019s motion. Nelson entered a <em>nolo contendere </em>plea pursuant to a plea agreement in which he reserved the right to appeal the denial of his motion to suppress. Nelson appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b29-7\">\u00b66 We review a district court\u2019s denial of a motion to suppress to determine whether the court's findings are clearly erroneous and whether those findings were applied correctly as a matter of law. <em>State v. Gill, </em>2012 MT 36, \u00b6 10, 364 Mont. 182, 272 P.3d 60.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b29-9\">\u00b67 <em>Did the District Court err when it denied defendant\u2019s motion to </em>suppress?</p>\n<p id=\"b29-10\">\u00b68 Nelson argues the District Court erroneously denied his motion to suppress the evidence of the stop. Specifically, Nelson argues the citizen informant\u2019s tip was unreliable and that Trooper Burson did not have particularized suspicion to conduct an investigatory stop. The State asserts Trooper Burson was provided with a reliable citizen informant\u2019s tip which created the particularized suspicion necessary to conduct an investigatory stop.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-11\">\u00b69 Both the United States Constitution and the Montana Constitution protect individuals from unreasonable searches and seizures. U.S. Const. amend. IV; Mont. Const. art. II, \u00a7 11. Under Montana law, a law enforcement officer \u201cmay stop any person or vehicle that is observed in circumstances that create a particularized suspicion that the person or occupant of the vehicle has committed, is committing, or is about to commit an offense.\u201d Section 46-5-401(1), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>MCA; <em>State v. Peters, </em>2011 MT 274, \u00b6 57, 362 Mont. 389, 264 P.3d 1124; <em>Hulse v. DOJ, Motor Vehicle Div., </em>1998 MT 108, \u00b6 12, 289 Mont. 1, 961 P.2d 75.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-5\">\u00b610 Particularized suspicion exists when an officer has \u201cobjective data and articulable facts from which an officer can make certain inferences, and a resulting suspicion that the subject is, or has been, engaged in wrongdoing.\u201d <em>City of Missoula v. Moore, </em>2011 MT 61, \u00b6 16, 360 Mont. 22, 251 P.3d 679. Whether particularized suspicion exists is a question of fact, which is evaluated under the totality of the circumstances. <em>Gill, </em>\u00b6 15. When evaluating the totality of the circumstances a court considers the quantity or content of the information available and the quality or degree of reliability of that information. <em>Gill, </em>\u00b6 15.</p>\n<p id=\"AI3q3\">\u00b611  An arresting officer may rely on information conveyed by a reliable third person to form the particularized suspicion necessary to justify an investigative stop. <em>State v. Pratt, </em>286 Mont. 156, 162, 951 P.2d 37, 41 (1997). To determine the reliability of a third person report and thus the sufficiency of an officer\u2019s particularized suspicion based on that report, this Court has adopted three factors to use in its evaluation. <em>State v. Clawson, </em>2009 MT 228, \u00b6 11, 351 Mont. 354, 212 P.3d 1056 (citing Pratt, 286 Mont. at 164-65, 951 P.2d at 42-43). The factors are: (1) whether the informant identified herself to the authorities; (2) whether the informant\u2019s report is based on personal observation; and (3) whether the officer\u2019s observations corroborate the informant\u2019s information. <em>Pratt, </em>286 Mont. at 164-65, 951 P.2d at 42-43.</p>\n<p id=\"AE7X\">\u00b612 Nelson argues, contrary to the facts in the record, that Saunders\u2019 report was unreliable because she did not identify herself, she was not the personally observing party, and that she was not willing to sign a complaint. Nelson argues Sharbono\u2019s report was insufficient to believe Nelson was drunk. Therefore, the citizen informant\u2019s tip was insufficient to give Trooper Burson particularized suspicion for an investigatory stop.</p>\n<p id=\"ak-dedup-0\">\u00b613  The first <em>Pratt </em>factor is whether the informant identified herself to the authorities. <em>Pratt, </em>286 Mont. at 165, 951 P.2d at 42. An informant\u2019s tip may be considered more reliable where the citizen identifies himself or herself, thus exposing himself to civil and criminal liability. <em>State v. Foster, </em>2017 MT 118, \u00b6 13, 387 Mont. 402, 394 P.3d 916 (citing Pratt, 286 Mont. at 165, 951 P.2d at 42). However, a citizen reporter is not required to self-identify or provide specific pieces of personal information in order for the report to be deemed reliable. <em>Foster, </em>\u00b6 13 (citing <em>State v. Brander, </em>2004 MT 150, 321 Mont. 484, 92 P.3d 1173; <em>State v. Lee, </em>282 Mont. 391, 395, 938 P.2d 637, 640 (1997)). A citizen reporter is not required to sign or be willing to sign a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>complaint in order for the report to be considered reliable. <em>See City of Missoula v. Tye, </em>2016 MT 153, \u00b6 3, 384 Mont. 24, 372 P.3d 1286.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-5\">\u00b614 Nelson concedes Sharbono\u2019s report satisfies the first factor because he was identified and willing to sign a complaint that Nelson was drunk. However, Nelson contests the reliability of Saunders\u2019 report. As the record disclosed, Saunders told and spelled to dispatch her first and last name, agreed to sign a complaint, provided her place of work and stated she could be reached there. Saunders testified at the evidentiary hearing to the above. This Court does not require a citizen informant to identify himself or herself or be willing to sign a complaint in order for the report to be deemed reliable. Here, Saunders both identified herself and was willing to sign a complaint. The District Court\u2019s finding that the first <em>Pratt </em>factor was satisfied is supported by substantial evidence and is not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-6\">\u00b615 The second <em>Pratt </em>factor is whether the informant\u2019s report is based on personal observation. <em>Pratt, </em>286 Mont. at 165, 951 P.2d at 42. An officer is allowed to infer that a report is based on a citizen informant\u2019s personal observations if \u201cthe report contains sufficient detail that it is apparent that the informant has not been fabricating the report out of whole cloth and the report is of the sort which in common experience may be recognized as having been obtained in a reliable way.\u201d <em>Moore, </em>\u00b6 21. A citizen informant\u2019s belief that a person is DUI must be based on his or her personal observations. <em>Moore, </em>\u00b6 21. Innocent details, personally observed by the citizen informant, are also relevant in assessing the reliability of the report. <em>Moore, </em>\u00b6 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-7\">\u00b616 Nelson argues Saunders\u2019 and Sharbono\u2019s personal observations are insufficient to allow Trooper Burson to infer the observations were made personally. Nelson argues because Saunders relayed Sharbono\u2019s personal observations the report was insufficiently based on personal observations.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-8\">\u00b617 This Court has determined that a report is made on personal observations sufficient to create particularized suspicion when a citizen informant relays information from a third party who is contemporaneously observing the behavior of the individual in question. <em>See Pratt, </em>286 Mont. at 166, 951 P.2d at 43. Recently, this Court reviewed this issue in <em>State v. Zietlow, </em>2017 MT 148, \u00b6 13, 388 Mont. 26, 396 P.3d 740. Similar to Saunders\u2019 and Sharbono\u2019s report, the caller in <em>Zietlow </em>related information regarding a possible drunk driver to the dispatcher which was relayed to her by a coworker and the caller relayed her own personal observations to the dispatcher. <em>Zietlow, </em>\u00b6 13. This Court determined the report was sufficient to satisfy <em>Pratt </em>because \u201cthe circumstances clearly establish the conduct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>was occurring as [caller] was talking to dispatch and that [caller] was relating what [coworker] was contemporaneously reporting and observing,\u201d and that separate calls by each to law enforcement were not necessary. <em>Zietlow, </em>\u00b6 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-5\">\u00b618 Here, Saunders was on the phone with the dispatcher while Sharbono watched Nelson drive away. Saunders spoke with both Sharbono and the dispatcher, contemporaneously relaying information from Sharbono. In fact, while Sharbono was not the caller, dispatch could hear him over the phone state that \u201che just bounced off that wall.\u201d Saunders then informed dispatch that she observed the man \u201cwalking into stuff, and he was going all over the place. He couldn\u2019t walk in a straight line to save his life, and then he got in the, stumbled around and got in the vehicle.\u201d The District Court\u2019s finding that the report was based on the personal observations of Saunders and Sharbono is supported by substantial evidence and is not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-6\">\u00b619 The third <em>Pratt </em>factor is whether the officer\u2019s observations corroborate the informant\u2019s information. <em>Pratt, </em>286 Mont. at 165, 951 P.2d at 43. An officer corroborates an informant\u2019s report by observing illegal activity or by finding \u201cthe person, the vehicle, and the vehicle\u2019s location substantially as described by the informant.\u201d <em>Gill, </em>\u00b6 30 (citing <em>Pratt, </em>286 Mont. at 165, 951 P.2d at 43). Where the first and second factors have been satisfied, an officer may corroborate the citizen informant\u2019s report by observing wholly innocent behavior. <em>Gill, </em>\u00b6 30. Nelson argues that the first two <em>Pratt </em>factors were not satisfied; therefore, Trooper Burson was required to observe independently illegal activity or evidence of impairment to form particularized suspicion before making the investigatory stop. <em>Pratt, </em>286 Mont. at 168, 951 P.2d at 44.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-7\">\u00b620 We determined above that the District Court\u2019s findings were not clearly erroneous and were based on substantial evidence when it determined the first two <em>Pratt </em>factors had been satisfied. Therefore, Trooper Burson could corroborate Saunders\u2019 and Sharbono\u2019s report by observing wholly innocent behavior. Nelson concedes that Trooper Burson corroborated Saunders\u2019 description of the vehicle and license plate number, its location, and its direction of travel. The District Court\u2019s finding that the third <em>Pratt </em>factor was satisfied is supported by substantial evidence and is not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-8\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b32-9\">\u00b621  Based on the totality of the circumstances, we conclude that the District Court\u2019s determination that particularized suspicion existed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>is not clearly erroneous. Saunders\u2019 and Sharbono\u2019s report contained sufficient indicia of reliability to form the basis for Trooper Burson\u2019s particularized suspicion. The District Court did not err in denying Nelson\u2019s motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-5\">\u00b622 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b33-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES BAKER, SANDEFUR and SHEA concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
