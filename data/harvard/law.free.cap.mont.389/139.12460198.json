Rasmussen moved to dismiss, arguing that two of his prior convictions were obtained in violation of his constitutional right to counsel. The District Court held a hearing on the motion at which Rasmussen testified as the only witness. After the hearing, the court denied Rasmussen\u2019s motion to dismiss on the ground that he had not met his burden of rebutting the presumption of regularity that attached to the prior convictions. Rasmussen appeals that ruling. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-7\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b166-8\">\u00b62 Rasmussen was arrested in April 2015 and charged with felony DUI under \u00a7 61-8-401(l)(a), MCA. The State based its felony enhancement on the fact that Rasmussen had four prior qualifying DUI convictions: on March 4, 1996, March 25, 1996, August 9, 2001, and April 3, 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-9\">\u00b63 Rasmussen moved to dismiss the charge. He asserted that the State had obtained the two March 1996 convictions in violation of his constitutional right to counsel and that these convictions could not be used for felony DUI enhancement purposes. Rasmussen submitted an affidavit with his motion to dismiss. As to the proceedings for the March 4,1996 conviction, Rasmussen asserted that \u201che did not have an attorney and that he did not sign a waiver of his right to an attorney and he did not understand that he had a right to an attorney.\u201d As to the March 25,1996 proceedings, Rasmussen\u2019s affidavit stated that \u201che did not have an attorney and did not sign any document waiving his right to an attorney.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b166-10\">\u00b64 The District Court held a hearing in September 2015 on Rasmussen\u2019s motion to dismiss. The parties agreed that there were no records in existence of Rasmussen\u2019s 1996 DUI proceedings, other than an e-mail from the Missoula Justice Court clerk advising that that court\u2019s file on Rasmussen\u2019s March 4, 1996 conviction had been shredded and including some coding notes from the court\u2019s \u201cold system.\u201d Rasmussen was the only witness at the hearing. His testimony on direct examination essentially repeated his statements in the affidavit. As to the March 4, 1996 proceedings, he testified that he did not have an attorney, that he did not sign a waiver of his right <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>to an attorney, and that he did not understand that he had a right to an attorney. With regard to the March 25, 1996 proceedings, he testified that he did not have an attorney and did not sign a waiver of his right to an attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">\u00b65 At the conclusion of Rasmussen\u2019s direct examination, the State argued that Rasmussen had failed to meet his burden to rebut the presumption of regularity in the 1996 convictions. The District Court asked for cross-examination, noting that it was \u201creserving [its] decision\u201d on whether Rasmussen had satisfied his burden until a more complete record could be developed.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">\u00b66 On cross-examination, Rasmussen testified that he knew at the time he executed his affidavit that no court records existed for the 1996 convictions that could contradict his affidavit. Rasmussen confirmed that his attorney had secured court records for the August 2001 conviction, that the records showed that Rasmussen was represented by counsel in those proceedings, that the 2001 case was the first time he \u201cever did need an attorney,\u201d and that he was not challenging the validity of that conviction. Rasmussen acknowledged that challenging a prior DUI conviction had \u201cworked for [him] in the past\u201d in a separate case. He agreed that he was previously convicted of multiple jailable, traffic-related offenses prior to 1996 and that he was arrested for DUI in 1983. Rasmussen testified that he remembered the judge, he remembered \u201cnot signing any waiver\u201d of his right to counsel, and he remembered that he did not have an attorney in the 1996 proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"AJb5\">\u00b67 The prosecutor asked specifically, \u201cDo you agree with me that that\u2019s a pretty specific memory, right, that you were never advised of the right to an attorney? That\u2019s pretty specific.\u201d Rasmussen replied, \u201cI\u2014well, I was never asked to sign anything for an attorney.\u201d The prosecutor asked Rasmussen for other details about the 1996 proceedings. Rasmussen stated what he recalled about the presiding judges and then responded, \u201cThis has been 20-some years ago.\u201d When the prosecutor remarked to Rasmussen that it was \u201ccurious\u201d that he remembered specifically that he did not sign a waiver of his right to counsel but that he could \u201cnot remember anything else\u201d from the proceedings, Rasmussen responded, \u201cI do remember not signing anything.\u201d The prosecutor again asked, \u201cAs to your 1996 justice court conviction, in your affidavit, you assert that you were never advised of your right to an attorney; is that right?\u201d Rasmussen responded, \u201cCorrect.\u201d She continued, \u201cYou never signed any waiver of your right to an attorney.\u201d Rasmussen again replied, \u201cCorrect.\u201d Rasmussen confirmed his assertion that, despite having eight prior jailable offenses before 1996, he never knew that he had the right to counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>\u00b68 The day after the hearing, the District Court denied Rasmussen\u2019s motion to dismiss. In a brief, written order denying the motion, the court summarized Rasmussen\u2019s and the State\u2019s arguments. The court then stated that, \u201c[biased on the contents of [Rasmussen\u2019s] Affidavit and his own testimony during the hearing,\u201d Rasmussen had not met his burden to rebut the presumption of regularity in his 1996 convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">\u00b69 A Missoula County jury subsequently found Rasmussen guilty of DUI. The court imposed a felony DUI sentence of thirteen months in the Department of Corrections\u2019 WATCh program, followed by a five-year suspended commitment to the Department. Rasmussen appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b168-7\">\u00b610 Whether a prior conviction maybe used for sentence enhancement is a question of law that we review de novo. <em>State v. Maine, </em>2011 MT 90, \u00b6 12, 360 Mont. 182, 255 P.3d 64. However, in determining whether a prior conviction is invalid, a district court may first need to make findings of fact, based on oral and documentary evidence presented by the parties, regarding the circumstances of that conviction. <em>Maine, </em>\u00b6 12. We will not disturb such findings unless they are clearly erroneous. <em>Maine, </em>\u00b6 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b168-9\">\u00b611 Rasmussen contends that the District Court erred in denying his motion to dismiss. He argues that the court erred as a matter of law by making a \u201ccategorical ruling\u201d that a defendant\u2019s \u201cself-serving\u201d testimony is never sufficient to satisfy the defendant\u2019s burden to overcome the presumption of validity that attaches to prior convictions. Rasmussen contends that a defendant\u2019s testimony is categorically insufficient only if it is both self-serving and conclusory. His testimony, although self-serving, was not conclusory in his view because it described the facts and circumstances of his 1996 convictions. He asserts that his testimony therefore constituted \u201caffirmative evidence\u201d sufficient to satisfy his burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-10\">\u00b612 The Due Process Clause of Article II, Section 17, of the Montana Constitution \u201cprotects a defendant from being sentenced based upon misinformation.\u201d <em>State v. Chaussee, </em>2011 MT 203, \u00b6 9, 361 Mont. 433, 259 P.3d 783 (citing <em>State v. Phillips, </em>2007 MT 117, \u00b6 17, 337 Mont. 248, 159 P. 3d 1078). \u201cA constitutionally infirm prior conviction used for enhancement purposes constitutes \u2018misinformation of constitutional magnitude.\u2019 \u201d <em>Chaussee, </em>\u00b6 9 (quoting <em>United States v. Tucker, </em>404 U.S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>443, 447, 92 S. Ct. 589, 592 (1972)). The State therefore \u201cmay not use a constitutionally infirm conviction to support an enhanced punishment.\u201d <em>Chaussee, </em>\u00b6 9 (quoting State <em>v. Okland, </em>283 Mont. 10, 15, 941 P.2d 431, 434 (1997)).</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">\u00b613 Article II, Section 24, of the Montana Constitution guarantees that in all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall have the right to the assistance of counsel. \u201cThe fundamental right to counsel in misdemeanor cases extends only to those cases in which a sentence of imprisonment is actually imposed.\u201d <em>State v. Hass, </em>2011 MT 296, \u00b6 20, 363 Mont. 8, 265 P.3d 1221 (citing <em>State v. Walker, </em>2008 MT 244, \u00b6 17, 344 Mont. 477, 188 P.3d 1069).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AJ7Y\">\u00b614  \u201c[A] rebuttable presumption of regularity attaches to [a] prior conviction, and we presume that the convicting court complied with the law in all respects.\u201d <em>State v. Krebs, </em>2016 MT 288, \u00b6 12, 385 Mont. 328, 384 P.3d 98 (citation and internal quotations omitted). \u201c[T]he defendant has the burden to overcome the presumption of regularity by producing affirmative evidence and persuading the court, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the prior conviction is constitutionally infirm.\u201d <em>Chaussee, </em>\u00b6 13. \u201cAffirmative evidence\u201d is evidence showing \u201cthat certain facts actually exist or, in the context of a collateral challenge, that certain facts actually existed at some point in the past\u2014e.g., that an indigent defendant actually requested the appointment of counsel but counsel was actually refused.\u201d <em>Hass, </em>\u00b6 16. \u201cAmbiguous documents, self-serving and conclusory inferences, and forcing the State to prove the validity of the prior conviction, when such validity is already presumed, do not suffice as affirmative evidence for purposes of meeting the defendant\u2019s burden.\u201d <em>Hass, </em>\u00b6 16 (citing <em>Chaussee, </em>\u00b6 18). If the defendant satisfies his burden, the burden shifts to the State to rebut the defendant\u2019s evidence. <em>Chaussee, </em>\u00b6 10. \u201cNevertheless, the defendant has the ultimate burden of proof to both produce and persuade \u2018by a preponderance of the evidence that the conviction is invalid.\u2019\" <em>State v. Hancock, </em>2016 MT 21, \u00b6 12, 382 Mont. 141, 364 P.3d 1258 (quoting Maine, \u00b6 12).</p>\n<p id=\"b169-7\">\u00b615 We do not agree with Rasmussen\u2019s assertion that the District Court \u201cmade a categorical ruling\u201d in this case. Rasmussen relies on the following statement from the District Court\u2019s order: <em>\u201c[T]he State argues </em>that the Montana Supreme Court has stated that \u2018[s]elf-serving <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>statements by the defendant that his or her conviction is infirm are insufficient to overcome the presumption of regularity and bar the use of the conviction for enhancement.\u2019 \u201d (Quoting <em>State v. Chesterfield, </em>2011 MT 256, \u00b6 27, 362 Mont. 243, 262 P.3d 1109) (emphasis added). Contrary to Rasmussen\u2019s assertion, this statement is not an expression of the court\u2019s rationale for its decision. Rather, it is part of the court\u2019s summary of the arguments. The court\u2019s order did not adopt the State\u2019s reasoning. Instead, following its summary, the court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-5\">During the September 14, 2015, hearing Defendant restated the contents of his Affidavit and the State had the opportunity to cross-examine Defendant regarding his Affidavit\u2019s contents. Based on the contents of Defendant\u2019s Affidavit and his own testimony during the hearing, this Court has determined that Defendant has not met his burden to overcome the \u201cpresumption of regula[rity] by producing affirmative evidence and persuading the Court, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the prior convictions are constitutionally infirm.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">(Quoting <em>Chesterfield, </em>\u00b6 20). The plain language of the order demonstrates that the court based its decision on the evidence before it and not on a categorical rule that a defendant\u2019s testimony could never satisfy the burden to rebut the presumption of regularity.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-7\">\u00b616 We are not convinced from the evidence that the court clearly erred in finding that Rasmussen failed to satisfy his burden. Rasmussen testified that he knew prior to executing his affidavit that no court records existed from his 1996 convictions that could contradict his assertions of constitutional violations. His testimony established that he remembered certain details of the 1996 proceedings\u2014namely, that he did not sign a waiver of his right to counsel\u2014but that he could not remember other details of the proceedings. Although Rasmussen asserted that he did not know at the time of his March 4, 1996 proceedings that he had a right to an attorney, he acknowledged that he had an extensive criminal history prior to those proceedings that included jailable offenses\u2014for which he may have had a right to counsel. Rasmussen\u2019s affidavit and testimony could have led the court reasonably to question his credibility and the probative force of his statements. It was \u201cexclusively within the province\u201d of the District Court to determine Rasmussen\u2019s credibility, and \u201cwe will not reweigh the evidence or the credibility of witnesses.\u201d <em>State v. Nixon, </em>2012 MT 316, \u00b6 21, 367 Mont. 495, 291 P.3d 1154.</p>\n<p id=\"AFK\">\u00b617  Even more, Rasmussen did not specifically allege that he did not waive his right to counsel. Rasmussen asserted only that he did not <em>sign a waiver </em>of his right to counsel. In <em>State v. Anderson, </em>2001 MT <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>188, 306 Mont. 243, 32 P.3d 750, Anderson claimed in part that he had been denied his right to counsel in a prior DUI proceeding. He submitted as evidence a copy of a disposition form that failed \u201cto make any notation or indication that [he] at any time waived his right to counsel.\u201d <em>Anderson, </em>\u00b6 21. We explained,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-5\">The fact that the disposition form fails to show that [Anderson] waived his right to counsel... is not direct evidence that Anderson was denied his right to an attorney ... it is not proof of anything. It is absence of proof. And it is wholly insufficient to shift the burden of proof to the State ... Simply submitting a document that does not prove regularity does not meet this burden [of showing irregularity].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b171-6\"><em>Anderson, </em>\u00b6 22. We have explained similarly that \u201cthe lack of evidence showing that the prior conviction is valid is not proof, by affirmative evidence, that the conviction is invalid.\u201d <em>Chaussee, </em>\u00b6 25.</p>\n<p id=\"AVP\">\u00b618  Rasmussen\u2019s testimony that he did not sign a waiver of his right to counsel does not show that he did not waive his right to counsel. Although a defendant may waive his right to counsel only if such waiver is made \u201cvoluntarily, knowingly, and intelligently,\u201d <em>Chesterfield, </em>\u00b6 16, there is no requirement that a defendant sign a document affirming his waiver of this right. Asserting that he did not sign a waiver of his right to counsel \u201cis not proof of anything. It is absence of <em>proof.\u2019\u2019Anderson, </em>\u00b6 22. Rasmussen\u2019s testimony that he did not sign a waiver of his right thus does not constitute \u201caffirmative evidence\u201d \u201cthat the prior conviction is constitutionally infirm.\u201d <em>Chaussee, </em>\u00b6 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-8\">\u00b619 Finally, Rasmussen argues that our holdings in <em>State v. Howard, </em>2002 MT 276, 312 Mont. 359, 59 P.3d 1075, and <em>State v. Walker, </em>2008 MT 244, 344 Mont. 477, 188 P.3d 1069, establish that his \u201cunequivocal\u201d sworn testimony is sufficient to satisfy his burden of rebutting the presumption of regularity in his 1996 convictions. In <em>Howard, </em>we held that the defendant\u2019s prior conviction was constitutionally infirm in part because the defendant asserted in an affidavit, \u201cI was not advised of my right to court-appointed counsel before I entered my plea of guilty, nor did I waive my right to court-appointed counsel.\u201d <em>Howard, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 4, 18. We held that these statements constituted \u201cdirect evidence\u201d sufficient to satisfy the defendant\u2019s burden. <em>Howard, </em>\u00b6 13. In <em>Walker, </em>the defendant filed an affidavit stating that she was not advised \u201cthat if she could not afford a lawyer, one would be appointed to represent her.\u201d <em>Walker, </em>\u00b6 11. We held that Walker met her burden of showing that her prior convictions were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>\u201cirregular.\u201d <em>Walker, </em>\u00b6 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">\u00b620 Our decision in <em>Maine </em>expressly modified the framework of analysis applied in <em>Howard </em>and <em>Walker </em>by imposing the burden on the defendant to prove by affirmative evidence that the prior conviction was constitutionally infirm. <em>Maine, </em>\u00b6 34. Unlike the defendants in <em>Howard </em>and <em>Walker, </em>Rasmussen did not make \u201cunequivocal\u201d statements that he was not advised of his right to counsel or that he did not waive that right. <em>Howard, </em>\u00b6 <em>13; Walker, </em>\u00b6 14. Rasmussen asserted only that he was not <em>aware </em>of his right to counsel during the March 4, 1996 proceedings and that he did not <em>sign </em>a waiver of that right in either of the proceedings. He reiterated on direct examination that, as to the March 4,1996 proceedings, he did not \u201cunderstand that [he] had a right to an attorney.\u201d Although he answered affirmatively to one of the prosecutor\u2019s questions misquoting a statement in his affidavit, his allegations do not amount to \u201cunequivocal\u201d testimony sufficient to overcome the presumption of validity that attached to his prior convictions. <em>Howard, </em>\u00b6 13<em>; Walker, </em>\u00b6 14. <em>Howard </em>and <em>Walker </em>are therefore distinguishable.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">\u00b621 The District Court based its decision on the evidence before it, and that evidence did not show affirmatively that the 1996 convictions violated Rasmussen\u2019s constitutional right to counsel. The court\u2019s finding that Rasmussen had not satisfied his evidentiary burden to rebut the presumption of regularity in his 1996 convictions was not clearly erroneous. <em>See Maine, </em>\u00b6 12. Its determination that those convictions could be used for felony enhancement purposes was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-7\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b172-8\">\u00b622 The District Court\u2019s judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b172-9\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES WHEAT, McKINNON, SHEA, SANDEFUR and RICE concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b169-8\"> There is no evidence in the record revealing whether Rasmussen was sentenced to jail for his 1996 DUI convictions.
