Mitchell, on behalf of herself and other County residents, sued the County over its alleged financial mismanagement and the State over its failure to take legal action against the County. The District Court dismissed the suit on the ground that Mitchell and the putative class (collectively Taxpayers) did not have standing to sue either the County or the State. Taxpayers appeal. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-10\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b149-11\">\u00b62 Taxpayers own real property and pay property taxes in Glacier County. They have been paying their taxes under protest in response to a March 2015 independent audit of the County\u2019s finances for fiscal years 2013 and 2014. The audit identified budget deficits in numerous County funds and stated that the County had exceeded its budgetary authority in many of those funds. A subsequent County Treasurer\u2019s report showed ongoing deficit balances in a number of the County\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">\u00b63 Taxpayers sued Glacier County and the State of Montana, alleging that both entities had failed to comply with budgeting and accounting laws. They asked the District Court for numerous forms of relief, including: (1) permission to prosecute the case as private attorneys general; (2) a declaration that the County had failed to comply with generally accepted governmental accounting standards; (3) a declaration that the County was in violation of laws designed to ensure \u201cstrict accountability\u201d of government finances; (4) a declaration that County officials who incurred financial obligations in excess of appropriations were personally liable for the resulting budget deficits; (5) an order requiring the State to withhold public funds from the County under the Single Audit Act until the County complied with its budgeting obligations; (6) an order requiring the State to hold County officials personally liable for their failure to ensure strict accountability; (7) an order appointing a receiver for the County; (8) permission to prosecute the case as a class action; (9) an order allowing Taxpayers to continue paying their taxes under protest until the County complied with its budgetary duties; and (10) a determination that the County violated Taxpayers\u2019 right to know under the Montana Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">\u00b64 In their Second Amended Complaint, Taxpayers made the following assertion regarding their alleged injury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-7\">Based on the 2013 and 2014 Audits of the county, and the deficiencies described therein, it is foreseeable that the county\u2019s residents and taxpayers would be injured as a result of the State\u2019s failure to enforce the terms of the Single Audit Act to \u201cinsure strict accountability of all revenues received and money spent\u201d by the county.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b150-8\">Taxpayers moved for partial summary judgment, and the State and County challenged Taxpayers\u2019 standing to sue.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-9\">\u00b65 The District Court denied Taxpayers\u2019 motion for partial summary judgment, denied class certification, and dismissed the case for lack of standing. It explained that Taxpayers had \u201cfailed to demonstrate [they have] suffered a concrete injury to [their] property or to [their] individual constitutional or statutory rights sufficient to establish standing under Montana law.\u201d It reasoned that Taxpayers\u2019 \u201cvague, speculative statement\u201d that it was \u201cforeseeable that the county\u2019s residents and taxpayers would be injured\u201d was insufficient to establish the injury requirement for standing. The court noted that the legal provisions under which Taxpayers alleged injury\u2014Article VIII, Section 12, of the Montana Constitution and the Single Audit Act, Title 2, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>chapter 7, Part 5, MCA\u2014did not establish private rights and did not grant Taxpayers the right to judicial relief. Taxpayers appeal the court\u2019s dismissal of their case.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">\u00b66 Standing is one of several justiciability doctrines that limit Montana courts to deciding only cases and controversies. <em>Heffernan v. Missoula City Council, </em>2011 MT 91, \u00b6 29, 360 Mont. 207, 255 P.3d 80. The determination of a party\u2019s standing to maintain an action is a question of law that we review de novo. <em>Heffernan, </em>\u00b6 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b151-8\">\u00b67 Taxpayers argue that they have standing to sue the County over its alleged financial mismanagement and to sue the State over its failure to hold County officials accountable for their unlawful actions. They contend that the County and the State violated Montana budgeting and accounting laws and that it is \u201cforeseeable\u201d that these violations will cause Taxpayers to \u201csuffer additional property tax burdens because of the County\u2019s unauthorized deficit spending, accounting failures, and disregard of audits.\u201d They assert also that they should be permitted to pursue this suit under the private attorney general doctrine and the Declaratory Judgments Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-9\">\u00b68 Taxpayers seek the following specific remedies on appeal: (1) a declaration that they may continue to pay taxes under protest until the County complies with its statutory duties; (2) a declaration that the County is in violation of the laws that implement the \u201cstrict accountability\u201d provision of the Montana Constitution; (3) an order requiring the State to withhold public funds from the County under the Single Audit Act until the County complies with its responsibilities; (4) an order requiring the State to hold County officials accountable under the law for their financial mismanagement; (5) an order appointing a receiver for the County; and (6) a declaration that the County has violated their right to know under the Constitution.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AqC\">\u00b69 Courts lack \u201cpower to resolve a case brought by a party without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>standing\u2014i.e., a personal stake in the outcome\u2014because such a party presents no actual case or controversy.\u201d <em>Heffernan, </em>\u00b6 29. Standing is a threshold jurisdictional requirement. <em>Heffernan, </em>\u00b6 29. \u201cThere are two elements to standing: the case-or-controversy requirement imposed by the Montana Constitution, and judicially created prudential limitations imposed for reasons of policy.\u201d <em>Schoof v. Nesbit, </em>2014 MT 6, \u00b6 15, 373 Mont. 226, 316 P.3d 831 <em>(citing Heffernan, </em>\u00b6 31).</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">\u00b610 Under the constitutional case-or-controversy requirement, the plaintiff must show, \u201cat an irreducible minimum,\u201d that he or she \u201chas suffered a past, present, or threatened injury to a property or civil right, and that the injury would be alleviated by successfully maintaining the action.\u201d <em>Schoof, </em>\u00b6 15 (citation and internal quotations omitted); <em>accord Chipman v. Nw. Healthcare Corp., </em>2012 MT 242, \u00b6\u00b6 26-27, 366 Mont. 450, 288 P.3d 193. The alleged injury must be \u201cconcrete\u201d rather than \u201cabstract.\u201d <em>Schoof, </em>\u00b6 20 (citation and internal quotations omitted). To qualify as \u201cconcrete,\u201d an injury must be \u201cactual or imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical.\u201d <em>Heffernan, </em>\u00b6 32. In other words, \u201cthe plaintiff must show that he has sustained, or is in immediate danger of sustaining some direct injury ... and not merely that he suffers in some indefinite way in common with people generally.\u201d <em>Schoof, </em>\u00b6 20 (citation and internal quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"A0F\">\u00b611 A plaintiffs standing may arise from an alleged violation of a constitutional or statutory right. <em>See Schoof, </em>\u00b6 23 (holding that plaintiffs allegation that County Commissioners violated his constitutional and statutory rights to know and to participate by adopting a policy at an unannounced meeting satisfied standing requirements). The Legislature \u201cmay enact statutes creating legal rights, the invasion of which creates standing, even though no injury would exist without the statute.\u201d <em>Heffernan, </em>\u00b6 34 (citation and internal quotations omitted). If the alleged injury \u201cis premised on the violation of constitutional and statutory rights, standing depends on whether the constitutional or statutory provision ... can be understood as granting persons in the plaintiffs position a right to judicial relief.\u201d <em>Schoof, </em>\u00b6 21 (citation and internal quotations omitted). \u201c[I]n all events,\u201d however, \u201cthe standing requirements imposed by the Constitution\u201d\u2014i.e., a showing of an alleged injury\u2014\u201cmust always be met.\u201d <em>Heffernan, </em>\u00b6 34.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">\u00b612 Article VIII, Section 12, of the Montana Constitution provides, \u201cThe legislature shall by law insure strict accountability of all revenue received and money spent by the state and counties, cities, towns, and all other local governmental entities.\u201d The Legislature responded to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>this directive by enacting the Single Audit Act, \u00a7\u00a7 2-7-501 to -522, MCA, and the Local Government Budget Accounting Act, \u00a7\u00a7 7-6-4001 to -4036, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">\u00b613 The Local Government Budget Accounting Act requires local government officials to not \u201cmake a disbursement or an expenditure or incur an obligation in excess of the total appropriations for a fund.\u201d Section 7-6-4005(1), MCA. Further, \u201cA local government official who violates subsection (1) is liable for the amount of the excess disbursement, expenditure, or obligation personally.\u201d Section 7-6-4005(2), MCA. \u201c[T]he governing body, each county or municipal official, and the district courts are limited to the amount of appropriations and by the classifications in the annual appropriation resolution provided for in 7-6-4030 when making disbursements or expenditures or incurring liabilities.\u201d Section 7-6-4033, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">\u00b614 The Legislature enacted the Single Audit Act in part to \u201cimprove the financial management of local government entities with respect to federal, state, and local financial assistance.\u201d Section 2-7-502(2)(a), MCA. This Act directs the Montana Department of Administration (Department) to \u201cprescribe by rule the general methods and details of accounting for the receipt and disbursement of all money belonging to local government entities\u201d and to establish a uniform financial reporting system for such entities. Sections 2-7-503(2), -504(1), MCA. Local government entities must \u201cconform with the accounting standards prescribed by the department.\u201d Section 2-7-504(1), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"A3a\">\u00b615 Under the Single Audit Act, local government entities must submit to independent financial audits every two years. Section 2-7-503(3), MCA. Once an entity receives a completed audit report, the entity must file the report with the Department and inform the Department what corrective actions it plans to take in response to \u201cdeficiencies or recommendations contained in the audit report.\u201d Sections 2-7-514(1), -515(1), MCA. Local government entities must \u201cadopt measures to correct the report findings\u201d and submit a \u201ccorrective action plan to the department.\u201d Section 2-7-515(3), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"A03\">\u00b616 If a local government entity fails \u201cto resolve findings or implement corrective measures,\u201d the Act provides that such failure \u201cshall result in the withholding of financial assistance in accordance with rules adopted by the department pending resolution or compliance.\u201d Section 2-7-515(3), MCA. If an officer or employee of a local government entity violates the law or fails to perform a duty, that individual \u201cmust be proceeded against by the attorney general or county, city, or town attorney as provided by law.\u201d Section 2-7-515(4), MCA. \u201cIf the county, city, or town attorney fails or refuses to prosecute the case, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>department may refer the case to the attorney general to prosecute the case.\u201d Section 2-7-515(4), MCA. The Department also may withhold financial assistance from or issue fines to a local government entity that fails to comply with financial reporting requirements. Section 2-7-517(1)-(2), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">\u00b617 Pursuant to the Single Audit Act, the County submitted to an independent audit of its finances for fiscal years 2013 and 2014. The audit report begins with a statement of the County\u2019s \u201cNet Position.\u201d For 2013, the report lists the County\u2019s total assets at $17,356,224, its total liabilities at $6,349,818, and its resulting \u201cTotal net position\u201d at $11,006,406. The report states further that, for 2014, the County\u2019s total assets were $16,626,470, its total liabilities were $6,036,077, and its \u201cTotal net position\u201d was $10,590,393. The report also summarizes the County\u2019s revenues and expenditures for each fiscal year. The County\u2019s total combined expenditures among its various funds exceeded revenues by $384,256 in 2013 and by $216,434 in 2014.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">\u00b618 The audit report proceeds with a discussion of the financial state of the County\u2019s individual funds. For 2013, the report notes that the General fund, the Road fund, the Ambulance fund, and \u201cOther Governmental Funds\u201d had positive fund balances, while the Public Safety (Law Enforcement) fund, the Glacier County Transit fund, the Sheriff Law Enforcement Grant, the Community Transportation Enhancement Program (CTEP), and the DEQ/DOE/ARRA Grant posted deficit fund balances. For 2014, the report again identifies the General fund, the Ambulance fund, and \u201cOther Governmental Funds\u201d as having positive balances; the Road fund, the Public Safety (Law Enforcement) fund, CTEP, the Museum fund, the Glacier County Transit fund, the Sheriff Law Enforcement Grant, the Glacier County Ambulance Capital fund, and the DEQ/DOE/ARRA Grant all had deficit balances. The report notes that the funds with deficit balances \u201cwill not have adequate amount of resources to cover expenditures or pay liabilities\u201d and that the County had exceeded its budgetary authority with respect to many of those funds. Despite these deficit balances in many of the County\u2019s individual funds, the report states that the County\u2019s \u201cTotal Government Funds\u201d balance stood at $4,208,721 for 2013 and at $4,038,997 for 2014.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-7\">\u00b619 The audit report includes findings of \u201ccertain deficiencies in internal control\u201d that the auditors considered \u201cmaterial weaknesses.\u201d The report highlights instances of different County departments or funds failing to maintain accurate ledgers or proper records of assets or cash transactions. The report also discusses the County\u2019s efforts at compliance with its financial obligations and its attempts to correct the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>deficiencies that the audit identified. The report notes that the \u201cCounty complies with generally accepted accounting principles\u201d and with relevant \u201cGovernmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB) pronouncements.\u201d For each fund that the report identifies as having a negative balance, it contains brief descriptions under the heading, \u201cHow Deficit will be Eliminated,\u201d of the County\u2019s plans to balance that fund\u2019s budget.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">\u00b620 In the \u201cSchedule of Findings and Questioned Costs,\u201d the report notes the County\u2019s budgeting and accounting deficiencies with regard to specific funds, departments, and financial practices. In response to each deficiency listed, the report summarizes the County\u2019s planned response under the heading, \u201cViews of Responsible Officials and Planned Corrective Action.\u201d For instance, with respect to the report\u2019s finding that the Ambulance Fund inadequately accounted for its revenues, the report states, \u201cThe County plans to implement policies and procedures requiring the entry of revenues when report is received from EMS, and performing a monthly reconciliation to determine if error exists.\u201d Finally, the audit notes that the \u201cprior audit report contained twenty five recommendations\u201d for improving the County\u2019s financial management. The audit reports that, of those twenty-five recommendations, the County has \u201cimplemented\u201d eighteen. The audit lists seven recommendations as \u201crepeated\u201d from the previous audit, meaning that the County has yet to implement those recommendations.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">\u00b621 Taxpayers assert that the audit demonstrates the County\u2019s financial mismanagement and their threatened injury from the State and local entities\u2019 failures to address this mismanagement.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-7\">A. Taxpayers\u2019 Standing to Sue the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-8\">\u00b622 Taxpayers argue that they have standing to sue the State because the State has failed to enforce the law against the County for its alleged financial mismanagement. They contend that the State has not fulfilled its fiduciary duty to ensure \u201cstrict accountability\u201d under the Constitution and that the State has abdicated its enforcement obligations under the Single Audit Act. In Taxpayers\u2019 view, these alleged failures violate their rights and grant them standing to sue the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-9\">\u00b623 We have held that \u201cnon-self-executing clauses of constitutions are non-justiciable political questions.\u201d <em>Columbia Falls Elem. Sch. Dist. No. 6 v. State, </em>2005 MT 69, \u00b6 15, 326 Mont. 304, 109 P.3d 257 (hereafter <em>Columbia Falls). </em>A constitutional provision that is \u201caddressed to the Legislature\u201d is \u201cnon-self-executing.\u201d <em>Columbia Falls, </em>\u00b6 16. Article VIII, Section 12, of the Montana Constitution addresses <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>the Legislature and requires it to take action to ensure \u201cstrict accountability.\u201d For this reason, the \u201cstrict accountability\u201d clause of Article VIII, Section 12, is not self-executing. <em>Friends of the Wild Swan v. Dep\u2019t of Natural Res. &amp; Conservation, </em>2005 MT 351, \u00b6 25, 330 Mont. 186, 127 P.3d 394 <em>(citing Reep v. Bd. of Cnty. Comm\u2019rs, </em>191 Mont. 162, 169, 622 P.2d 685, 689 (1981)). The clause therefore is non-justiciable. <em>See Columbia Falls, </em>\u00b6 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">\u00b624 Taxpayers nonetheless argue that, according to our holding in <em>Columbia Falls, </em>the State\u2019s alleged violations of the legislation implementing the \u201cstrict accountability\u201d clause\u2014namely the Single Audit Act\u2014grant them standing. In <em>Columbia Falls, </em>we held that the plaintiffs had standing to sue the State over its administration and funding of public schools, which allegedly violated Article X, Section 1(3), of the Montana Constitution. <em>Columbia Falls, </em>\u00b6 19. That provision mandates that the Legislature \u201cprovide a basic system of free quality public elementary and secondary schools.\u201d Mont. Const. art. X, \u00a7 1(3). We explained that this constitutional provision \u201cmust be read in conjunction with Section 1 of Article X, which guarantees a right to education.\u201d <em>Columbia Falls, </em>\u00b6 19. The constitutional provision at issue in <em>Columbia Falls </em>thus implicated the express constitutional right to an education. <em>Columbia Falls, </em>\u00b6 19. We noted that once the Legislature has \u201cexecuted\u201d a constitutional provision \u201cthat implicates individual constitutional rights, courts can determine whether that enactment fulfills the Legislature\u2019s constitutional responsibility.\u201d <em>Columbia Falls, </em>\u00b6 17 (citation and internal quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">\u00b625 By contrast to <em>Columbia Falls, </em>the \u201cstrict accountability\u201d clause does not implicate specific \u201cindividual constitutional rights.\u201d <em>Columbia Falls, </em>\u00b6 17. It directs the Legislature to pass legislation ensuring strict accountability of revenue. Mont. Const. art. VIII, \u00a7 12. Unlike with Article X, Section 1(3), which, when \u201cread in conjunction\u201d with the Constitution\u2019s right to an education, grants individual constitutional rights, there is no separate individual constitutional right to \u201cstrict accountability\u201d of revenues. <em>Columbia Falls, </em>\u00b6 19. The \u201cstrict accountability\u201d clause therefore cannot \u201cbe understood as granting persons in [Taxpayers\u2019] position a right to judicial relief.\u201d <em>Schoof, </em>\u00b6 21.</p>\n<p id=\"akq-dedup-0\">\u00b626 Taxpayers\u2019 reliance on <em>Columbia Falls </em>would be more apropos to an argument that the Legislature\u2019s enactments under Article VIII, Section 12\u2014i.e., the Single Audit Act and the Local Government Budget Accounting Act\u2014failed to \u201cfulfillI ] the Legislature\u2019s constitutional responsibility\u201d of ensuring \u201cstrict accountability of all revenue.\u201d <em>Columbia Falls, </em>\u00b6 17; Mont. Const. art. VIII, \u00a7 12; <em>see </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number><em>Friends of the Wild Swan, </em>\u00b6 25. Taxpayers do not allege that the Legislature failed to comply with its constitutional mandate when it enacted these Acts. Their allegations of violations of the \u201cstrict accountability\u201d clause therefore are not justiciable and do not establish standing.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">\u00b627 Taxpayers respond that \u201cthe implementing statutes confer rights\u201d and that the Court must hold the Executive Branch accountable as a co-equal branch for carrying out its obligations under the Constitution. Yet the Legislature defines the Executive Branch\u2019s accountability through its legislative enactments. <em>See, e.g., Friends of the Wild Swan, </em>\u00b6 25. Here, the Legislature enacted laws\u2014such as the Single Audit Act\u2014that set forth the Executive Branch\u2019s responsibility for enforcing the \u201cstrict accountability\u201d clause of the Constitution. <em>See </em>\u00a7\u00a7 2-7-501 to -522, MCA. That clause does not allow a claim independent of the statutes that implement it. <em>See Friends of the Wild Swan, </em>\u00b6 25. We thus turn to the legislative enactment implementing the \u201cstrict accountability\u201d clause\u2014the Single Audit Act\u2014of which Taxpayers claim the State has run afoul.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">\u00b628 Taxpayers argue that the State violated the terms of the Single Audit Act and that they may sue the State to redress these alleged violations. Taxpayers do not argue that the Single Audit Act expressly confers private rights of action on individuals in Taxpayers\u2019 position. <em>See generally </em>\u00a7\u00a7 2-7-501 to -522, MCA. They contend instead that the Act obligated the State to withhold financial assistance from the County and that they may sue to compel the State to take legal action against local officials because \u201cevery person who suffers detriment from the unlawful act of another has a remedy\u201d under Montana law. (Citing \u00a7 27-1-202, MCA.)</p>\n<p id=\"b157-7\">\u00b629 The Act provides that, when a local government entity fails to comply with financial reporting requirements, \u201cthe department <em>may </em>issue an order stopping payment of any state financial assistance to the local government entity.\u201d Section 2-7-517(1), MCA (emphasis added). It provides further that, after an entity submits a corrective action plan to the Department, \u201cFailure to resolve findings or implement corrective measures shall result in the withholding of financial assistance in accordance with rules adopted by the department pending resolution or compliance.\u201d Section 2-7-515(3), MCA. Under the corresponding Department rule,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-8\">If the department does not receive an acceptable response or corrective action plan [from the local government entity]... it can request, pursuant to 2-7-515, MCA, that state agencies withhold payments of financial assistance from the local government entity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>pending receipt of an acceptable response or corrective action plan. The department, after consultation with the appropriate state agency or agencies, may designate the financial assistance payments to be withheld.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">Admin. R. M. 2.4.409(12).</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">\u00b630 The plain language of the Single Audit Act gives the Department authority to review a local government\u2019s audit response and to determine whether to withhold financial assistance. The Act\u2019s directive that an entity\u2019s \u201c[flailure to resolve findings or implement corrective measures <em>shall </em>result in the withholding of financial assistance\u201d is followed by language bestowing discretion on the Department to craft rules determining the circumstances under which such withholding will occur. Section 2-7-515(3), MCA. The statute does not dictate the Department\u2019s sufficiency review, does not impose a time limit or specific requirements for an entity\u2019s submission of a corrective action plan to the Department, and does not direct the manner in which the local government entity must \u201cresolve findings or implement corrective measures.\u201d Section 2-7-515(3), MCA. The Department\u2019s corresponding rule states that it <em>may </em>withhold financial assistance <em>if </em>it \u201cdoes not receive an acceptable response or corrective action plan\u201d from the County. Admin. R. M. 2.4.409(12). Taxpayers do not challenge the validity of the rule. Read in conjunction, \u00a7 2-7-515(3), MCA, and Admin. R. M. 2.4.409(12), provide the Department discretion to determine whether and how to withhold financial assistance from local government entities.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-7\">\u00b631 The Single Audit Act provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-8\">In cases where a violation of law or nonperformance of duty is found on the part of an officer, employee, or board, the officer, employee, or board must be proceeded against by the attorney general <em>or </em>county, city, or town attorney <em>as provided by law </em>... If the county, city, or town attorney fails or refuses to prosecute the case, the department <em>may </em>refer the case to the attorney general to prosecute the case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b158-9\">Section 2-7-515(4), MCA (emphases added). Taxpayers argue that this language requires the State to prosecute County officials. The plain language of the statute, however, states that the Department <em>may </em>refer officials for prosecution if the local attorney declines to prosecute the case. Section 2-7-515(4), MCA. And prosecuting authorities are \u201cprovided by law,\u201d \u00a7 2-7-515(4), MCA, with broad discretion to determine when to undertake criminal actions, <em>State v. Strong, </em>2015 MT 251, \u00b6 23, 380 Mont. 471, 356 P.3d 1078 (\u201c[W]e afford prosecutors \u2018broad discretion to determine whether to prosecute an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>offender and what offense to charge.\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>State v. Tichenor, </em>2002 MT 311, \u00b6 26, 313 Mont. 95, 60 P.3d 454). The statute thus does not mandate the Department\u2019s prosecution of local government officials.</p>\n<p id=\"aa-dedup-0\">\u00b632  Although the Single Audit Act grants the Department authority to take enforcement action against local government entities that fail to comply with their financial duties, it affords the Department wide latitude in determining when and under what circumstances to take action. <em>See </em>\u00a7\u00a7 2-7-515(3), (4), MCA. A party in Taxpayers\u2019 position cannot compel the State to take discretionary action. <em>See Doty v. Mont. Comm\u2019r of Political Practices, </em>2007 MT 341, \u00b6 15, 340 Mont. 276, 173 P.3d 700 (holding that a writ of mandamus cannot \u201ccompel performance of a discretionary function\u201d). Taxpayers therefore cannot show that their claims against the State assert a legally cognizable injury to a civil right sufficient to confer standing. <em>See Schoof, </em>\u00b6 15.</p>\n<p id=\"Atv\">\u00b633  In addition, \u00a7 27-1-202, MCA, does not support Taxpayers\u2019 argument for standing. It reflects established principles of standing by requiring that a person \u201csuffer[ ] detriment\u201d in order to be entitled to a remedy. For the reasons discussed below, we conclude that Taxpayers have not demonstrated that their claimed potential for increased property taxes in response to the County\u2019s financial situation constitutes a concrete injury sufficient to confer standing in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-7\">B. Taxpayers\u2019 Standing to Sue the County.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-8\">\u00b634 Taxpayers assert that the County is running a budget deficit and that it does not have sufficient financial resources to meet its obligations. They allege that this deficit threatens them with economic injury because it is \u201cforeseeable\u201d that the County will raise property taxes to compensate for its imbalanced budget. Taxpayers argue further that the County has violated statutes that implement the \u201cstrict accountability\u201d clause of the Montana Constitution\u2014including the Single Audit Act and the Local Government Budget Accounting Act\u2014and that these violations confer standing on them. Taxpayers assert that the County\u2019s financial violations are ongoing.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-9\">\u00b635 Taxpayers argue that our holding in <em>Helena Parents Commission v. Lewis and Clark County </em>Commissioners, 277 Mont. 367, 922 P.2d 1140 (1996), supports their contention that the County\u2019s financial deficiencies threaten them with increased property taxes and give them standing to sue. The plaintiffs in <em>Helena Parents Commission </em>sued the county and the school district, alleging that the defendants had improperly invested public funds. <em>Helena Parents Comm\u2019n, </em>277 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>Mont. at 370, 922 P.2d at 1142. The plaintiffs\u2019 complaint specifically alleged that the county\u2019s and the school district\u2019s actions had resulted in a loss of approximately $5.5 million, as a result of which the local government would need to raise revenues and reduce public services in order to compensate for the loss. <em>Helena Parents Comm\u2019n, </em>277 Mont. at 370, 922 P.2d at 1142. In holding that the plaintiffs had standing to sue, we explained that \u201cplaintiffs alleged that the government will impose tax burdens on them as it seeks to recoup losses and that the investments will result in a lessening of governmental services. These allegations of an economic injury satisfy the injury requirement.\u201d <em>Helena Parents Comm\u2019n, </em>277 Mont. at 372, 922 P.2d at 1143.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">\u00b636 This case differs significantly from <em>Helena Parents Commission. </em>First, the contested issue\u2014and the focus of our analysis in that case\u2014was on the second requirement for standing: whether the alleged injury was distinguishable from the injury to the public generally. <em>Helena Parents Comm\u2019n, </em>277 Mont. at 372-74, 922 P.2d at 1143-44. Second, unlike the <em>Helena Parents </em>plaintiffs, Taxpayers did not specifically allege in their complaints that the County\u2019s financial mismanagement resulted in a quantifiable amount of overspending that would require an increase in property taxes. Taxpayers\u2019 second amended complaint states only that, based on the \u201cdeficiencies\u201d described in the audit, \u201cit is <em>foreseeable </em>that the county\u2019s residents and taxpayers would be injured.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Taxpayers have not made concrete allegations that the County squandered a specific amount of money that it would need to recoup through increased property taxes. <em>See Helena Parents Comm\u2019n, </em>277 Mont. at 372, 922 P.2d at 1143. <em>Helena Parents Commission </em>is not analogous.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">\u00b637 The audit findings would not support such allegations in any event. The audit report notes the County\u2019s financial deficiencies, including budget deficits in numerous individual funds and expenditures in excess of revenues. Yet the report shows that the County\u2019s \u201cTotal Government Funds\u201d balance stood at $4,208,721 for 2013 and at $4,038,997 for 2014. Its \u201cTotal net position\u201d\u2014the difference between its assets and its liabilities\u2014was $11,006,406 for 2013 and $10,590,393 for 2014. The report thus shows that the County has more than adequate financial resources to meet its liabilities. The fact that the County has inadequately budgeted for certain funds does not require it to raise revenue to balance those funds. It conceivably could use its overall surplus in assets and its excess \u201cTotal Government Funds\u201d balance to redistribute money across its individual funds so that all are balanced. Whether such actions would comply with State budgetary laws or recognized accounting principles is not the issue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>here. The threshold problem is that Taxpayers cannot show, based on the audit report, that the threat of the County raising property taxes is \u201cactual or imminent,\u201d rather than \u201cconjectural or hypothetical.\u201d <em>Heffernan, </em>\u00b6 32; <em>see Schoof, </em>\u00b6 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">\u00b638 Taxpayers contend, however, that the County\u2019s failure to take corrective action to cure its alleged financial violations supports their position that tax increases are foreseeable. The report, though, summarizes the County\u2019s responses to its financial deficiencies and reflects its continuing efforts to implement proper financial management strategies. For each deficiency in the County\u2019s funds, departments, and financial practices that the report identifies, it describes the County\u2019s planned corrective action. The report states that County officials were aware of negative cash balances in some of the County\u2019s major funds and that the County had \u201cimplemented a more conservative plan in making only the essential expenditure transactions.\u201d It notes further that the County has adopted eighteen of the twenty-five recommendations from the prior audit report. The face of the audit demonstrates where the County has taken and continues to take corrective action to remedy its deficiencies. Again, the allegations fall short of the concrete injury needed to demonstrate standing. Taxpayers\u2019 alleged foreseeable economic injury therefore is insufficient to satisfy the constitutional \u201ccase-or-controversy\u201d requirement for standing to sue the County. <em>Schoof, </em>\u00b6 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">\u00b639 Taxpayers argue further that the County would be immunized for its alleged violations of the Single Audit Act and the Local Government Budget Accounting Act if the Court fails to grant them standing to seek judicial review of the County\u2019s financial mismanagement. Taxpayers rely in part on our holding in <em>Grossman v. Department of Natural Resources, </em>209 Mont. 427, 682 P.2d 1319 (1984), for their contention that the County\u2019s alleged statutory violations are sufficient to establish standing. They highlight our statement that \u201c[w]e will recognize the standing of a taxpayer, without more, to question the state constitutional validity of a tax or use of tax monies where the issue or issues presented directly affect the constitutional validity of the state or its political subdivisions acting to collect the tax, issue bonds, or use the proceeds thereof.\u201d <em>Grossman, </em>209 Mont. at 438-39, 682 P.2d at 1325. As the District Court observed, Taxpayers do not \u201cchallenge the constitutional validity of Glacier County\u2019s collection of taxes nor its use of the funds.\u201d Taxpayers allege that the County committed errors in its budgeting and accounting of revenues, not that its collection or expenditures of the funds was unconstitutional. <em>Grossman </em>therefore does not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"akj-dedup-0\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>\u00b640  Instead, the above analysis resolves Taxpayers\u2019 claim. As Taxpayers implicitly acknowledge, neither the Single Audit Act nor the Local Government Budget Accounting Act contains any express provision granting private rights of action to individuals in Taxpayers\u2019 position. But even if the County violated one or more provisions of these Acts\u2014a question that we do not decide here\u2014Taxpayers have not shown, \u201cat an irreducible minimum,\u201d that they have \u201csuffered a past, present, or threatened injury\u201d that \u201cwould be alleviated by successfully maintaining the action.\u201d <em>Schoof, </em>\u00b6 15. Without demonstrating a concrete injury, Taxpayers cannot establish standing to sue for violations of the Single Audit Act or the Local Government Budget Accounting Act. <em>See Schoof, </em>\u00b6 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">C. Taxpayers\u2019 Additional Standing Theories.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">\u00b641 Finally, Taxpayers invoke the private attorney general doctrine and the Declaratory Judgments Act as additional bases for standing. The private attorney general doctrine allows parties in certain cases to recover attorney fees \u201cwhen the government, for some reason, fails to properly enforce interests which are significant to its citizens.\u201d <em>Clark Fork Coalition v. Tubbs, </em>2017 MT 184, \u00b6 14, 388 Mont. 205, 399 P.3d 295 (citation and internal quotations omitted). The private attorney general doctrine entitles a party to seek and recover attorney fees. <em>See Clark Fork Coalition, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 15-16. It is not a cause of action. Taxpayers cite no authority that the doctrine establishes a right to judicial relief independent of recognized standing requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"A_I\">\u00b642  The Declaratory Judgments Act provides, \u201cAny person ... whose rights, status, or other legal relations are affected by a statute ... may have determined any question of construction or validity arising under the ... statute ... and obtain a declaration of rights, status, or other legal relations thereunder.\u201d Section 27-8-202, MCA. We have held that \u201cthe requirement of justiciable controversy [] applies to declaratory judgment actions.\u201d <em>Marbut v. Sec\u2019y of State, </em>231 Mont. 131, 135, 752 P.2d 148, 150 (1988). As discussed earlier in this Opinion, Taxpayers have not adequately alleged a concrete, threatened injury, and therefore have not established standing. Without an independent ground for standing, they cannot assert a claim under the Declaratory Judgments Act. <em>See </em>Marbut, 231 Mont. at 135-36, 752 P.2d at 151 (\u201c[W]e have found no case granting standing to a complainant or applicant who shows no injury or threatened injury.\u201d). Neither the private attorney general doctrine nor the Declaratory Judgments Act grants Taxpayers standing to seek relief in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">\u00b643 The District Court determined correctly that Taxpayers lack standing to sue either the County or the State. The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b163-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES McKINNON, SHEA, SANDEFUR and RICE concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b151-10\"> Although Taxpayers state on appeal that the County violated their constitutional right to know, they make no argument as to how the County violated this right. \u201c[W]e are not obligated to develop arguments on behalf of parties to an appeal, nor are we to guess a party\u2019s precise position, or develop legal analysis that may lend support to his <em>position.\u201dMcCulley v. Am. Land Title Co., </em>2013 MT 89, \u00b6 20, 369 Mont. 433, 300 P.3d 679. We therefore decline to address Taxpayers\u2019 contention that the County violated their right to know.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b163-7\">JUSTICE WHEAT,</author>\n<p id=\"A3R\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-8\">\u00b644 I respectfully dissent from the majority. I would reverse and remand because the Taxpayers have standing to go forward with the lawsuit against Glacier County. In my opinion, the majority improperly finds that the Taxpayers have failed to allege an injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-9\">\u00b645 The majority\u2019s attempt to distinguish <em>Helena Parents Comm\u2019n </em>is unavailing. The majority distinguishes the case at hand from <em>Helena Parents Commission </em>on two grounds: (1) the foremost issue in <em>Helena Parents Commission </em>was not whether an alleged injury had occurred, and (2) the plaintiffs in <em>Helena Parents Commission </em>alleged a quantifiable injury. Opinion, \u00b6 36. As to the first ground, whether the issue was the foremost issue in the case is irrelevant. The Court in <em>Helena Parents Commission </em>concluded that the plaintiffs had alleged an injury to satisfy the standing requirement. <em>Helena Parents Comm\u2019n, </em>277 Mont. at 372, 922 P.2d at 1143.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-10\">\u00b646 As to the second ground, <em>Helena Parents Commission\u2019s </em>conclusion that the plaintiffs had standing is akin to the case at hand. The Court stated \u201cplaintiffs alleged that the government will impose tax burdens on them as it seeks to recoup losses and that the investments will result in a lessening of governmental services. These allegations of an economic injury satisfy the injury requirements.\u201d <em>Helena Parents Comm\u2019n, </em>277 Mont. at 372, 922 P.2d at 1143. Here, Taxpayers alleged a similar economic injury. Taxpayers alleged that the mismanagement of public funds by the County will impose additional tax burdens on them or reductions in public services to compensate for any deficits. In my opinion, based on <em>Helena Parents Commission, </em>the Taxpayers have alleged an actual threatened injury sufficient to allow them to proceed with their case.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-11\">\u00b647 To justify their reasoning, the majority picks and chooses specific facts from the audits. The majority focuses only on the \u201cTotal Government F unds\u201d balance but does not consider any other part of the audits. Opinion, \u00b6 37. The majority concludes based on this that the Taxpayers have not met the injury requirement to have standing. Such analysis is misleading. For example, the audits revealed \u201cmaterial weaknesses\u201d and \u201csignificant deficiencies\u201d in the County\u2019s management <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>of public funds that provide public services. The audits specifically stated, \u201c[flor fiscal year 2014, the County does not have adequate resources to meet current liabilities causing a deficit fund balance.\u201d Additionally, the Taxpayers point to eight serious deficiencies highlighted in the audits that have continued throughout several years in their complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">\u00b648 The majority\u2019s conclusions about the validity of the audit should be left to a jury, not a judge. Based on the deficiencies found within the audits, the Taxpayers should be afforded the opportunity to fully explore and develop the alleged mismanagement of public funds. Standing requirements should not be barriers to justice. Thus, in my opinion, based on <em>Helena Parents Commission </em>and the deficiencies noted in the audits, the Taxpayers have alleged an injury that is not so speculative that we should reject it outright so as to deny Taxpayers the opportunity to purse their claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">\u00b649 For these reasons, I dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
