Erickson (Decedent) died on November 18,2015. At that time, he was married to Gail Erickson (Gail); he had two grown children, Tyler Erickson (Tyler) and Taylor Wortman. Gail is not the biological parent of either child. Decedent executed a Last Will and Testament on May 2,1995. After his first wife died, Decedent executed a Codicil to the Last Will and Testament on February 5, 2008. The Codicil nominated Tyler to act as Personal Representative of the Estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-8\">\u00b64 On December 16, 2015, Gail filed an Application for Informal Appointment of Personal Representative in Intestacy. The District Court Clerk granted Gail\u2019s application and appointed her Personal Representative.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-9\">\u00b65 On December 18, 2015, Tyler filed a Petition for Formal Probate of Will, Determination of Testacy and Heirs, and Appointment of Personal Representative. At that time, the Last Will and Testament and Codicil were submitted collectively as the Decedent\u2019s Will. The District Court issued an order setting a hearing on the Formal Petition for January 26, 2016, and directed anyone who intended to contest the Will and/or object to the appointment of Tyler as the Personal Representative was required to give written notice to the attorneys and the District Court no later than January 5, 2016. A copy of the order was provided to Gail personally, as well as counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-10\">\u00b66 On January 22, 2016, Gail\u2019s counsel notified Tyler\u2019s counsel that Gail would not object to the probate of the Will and Codicil, the appointment of Tyler as Personal Representative, or the determination that Montana is the situs for the probate. On January 25, 2016, the day before the hearing, Tyler\u2019s counsel provided Gail\u2019s counsel with drafts of a Proposed Order and Letters of Appointment that would be presented to the Court for issuance. That same day Gail\u2019s counsel sent an email to Tyler\u2019s counsel providing him with a draft of \u201cthe Idaho document I mentioned,\u201d told him that \u00a7 72-3-314, MCA, addresses the probate of more than one document, and that the parties could discuss it at the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-11\">\u00b67 At the January 26, 2016 hearing, Gail\u2019s counsel advised the court that he had reviewed the Proposed Order and Letters of Appointment from Tyler\u2019s counsel, and had no objection. No party raised any issues <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>related to \u201cthe Idaho document\u201d (hereinafter referred to as the 6 Point Document). Thus, without objection, the District Court issued an Order of Formal Probate and appointed Tyler as Personal Representative. Gail did not appeal the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">\u00b68 Almost five months later, on June 3, 2016, Gail\u2019s counsel filed a Verified Creditor\u2019s Claim asserting the 6 Point Document is a written contract by the Decedent to make payments of money and provide benefits to or on behalf of Gail, and that it is a contract to make a will or devise that provides for said payment of money and provision of benefits. On August 16,2016, Gail\u2019s counsel filed a Petition for Elective Share, Homestead Allowance, Exempt Property, and Family Allowance. On September 15, 2016, Tyler as the Personal Representative, filed a Notice of Disallowance of the Verified Creditor\u2019s Claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">\u00b69 On September 16,2016, Gail obtained new counsel. On November 14, 2016, Gail\u2019s counsel petitioned the District Court to allow her creditor claim. However, on November 21,2016, before the court could rule on that motion, Gail\u2019s counsel filed a Motion for Relief From Formal Testacy Order entered 1/26/2016; or alternatively for Imposition of Constructive Trust. Gail\u2019s counsel argued the 6 Point Document should have been included in the Order of Formal Probate of the Will. The issue was fully briefed. On January 9, 2017, Gail withdrew her creditor claim against the Estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-7\">\u00b610 On January 18, 2017, the District Court denied Gail\u2019s Motion for Relief From Formal Testacy Order entered 1/26/2016; or alternatively for Imposition of Constructive Trust. Gail appeals the denial of her Motion for Relief. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-8\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b176-9\">\u00b611 We review a district court\u2019s ruling denying a motion to alter or amend its judgment pursuant to Rule 60(b), M. R. Civ. P., for an abuse of discretion. <em>Heller v. Gremaux, </em>2002 MT 199, \u00b6 7, 311 Mont. 178, 53 P.3d 1259.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-10\">\u00b612 The interpretation and construction of a statute is a matter of law, and we review whether the district court interpreted and applied a statute correctly de novo. <em>State v. Triplett, </em>2008 MT 360, \u00b6 13, 346 Mont. 383, 195 P.3d 819.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-11\">\u00b613 This Court reviews factual findings to determine whether they are clearly erroneous. <em>Roland v. Davis, </em>2013 MT 148, \u00b6 21, 370 Mont. 327, 302 P.3d 91. A finding of fact is clearly erroneous if it is not supported by substantial evidence, if the court misapprehended the effect of the evidence or if, upon reviewing the record, this Court is left with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>definite and firm conviction that the district court made a mistake. <em>Roland, </em>\u00b6 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">\u00b614 <em>Issue One: Did the District Court err in determining M. R. Civ. P. 60(b) did not apply?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b177-7\">\u00b615 Gail asserts that M. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(6) governs her January 26, 2016 Motion for Relief From Formal Testacy Order, or alternatively for Imposition of Constructive Trust, not \u00a7 72-3-317,MCA. Gail argues the District Court erred when it determined that M. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(6) does not apply to formal testacy orders because it is inconsistent with \u00a7 72-3-317, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-8\">\u00b616 Rule 60(b) applies generally to final judgments, orders, or proceedings, while \u00a7 72-3-317, MCA, applies specifically to formal testacy orders. Rule 1 of the Montana Rules of Civil Procedure states \u201cthese rules govern the procedure in all civil actions and proceedings in the district courts of the state of Montana, including probate proceedings, unless specifically provided to the contrary in the Uniform Probate Code.\u201d Montana adopted the Uniform Probate Code (UPC) in 1947 as codified in \u00a7 72-1-101, MCA, et seq. (formerly R.C.M., 91A-1-101(1947)). The UPC, \u00a7 72-1-207, MCA, provides that \u201cunless specifically provided to the contrary in this code or unless inconsistent with its provisions, the rules of civil procedure, including the rules concerning vacation of orders and appellate review, govern formal proceedings under this code.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"ApM\">\u00b617  Therefore, the Montana Rules of Civil Procedure apply to all probate actions and proceedings, unless specifically provided to the contrary in the UPC or the Rules of Civil Procedure are inconsistent with the provisions of the UPC.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-10\">\u00b618 For the case at hand, the UPC, \u00a7 72-3-317, MCA, specifically provides that a formal testacy order is \u201cfinal as to all persons with respect to all issues.\u201d When a petitioner seeks relief from a formal testacy order, their petition is \u201csubject to appeal and subject to vacation as provided in 72-3-318 and this section.\u201d Section 72-3-317, MCA. The plain language of the statute allows for an appeal or vacation from a formal testacy order only under the terms provided in \u00a7\u00a7 72-3-317 and -318, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"anc-dedup-0\">\u00b619  Section 72-3-317, MCA, is inconsistent with M. R. Civ. P. 60 because no petition for probate of any other instrument may be entertained unless the final testacy order is first appealed or vacated as stated in \u00a7 72-3-317, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>\u00b620 Gail cites a list of non-jurisdictional UPC cases asserting that final testacy orders are subject to collateral attack under M. R. Civ. P. 60(b).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After review of these cases, we disagree with their application to the case at hand. Under the facts of this case, a petition for relief from a formal testacy order based on a later offered will, are entertained under \u00a7\u00a7 72-3-317 and -18, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"A0p\">\u00b621  The District Court properly interpreted M. R. Civ. P. 60 and \u00a7 72-3-317, MCA, correctly determining that Gail\u2019s motion for relief from the formal testacy order must be considered under \u00a7 72-3-317, MCA. Therefore, we decline to address Gail\u2019s analysis of the motion for relief from formal testacy order under M. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">\u00b622 <em>Issue Two: Did the District Court err in denying Gail\u2019s motion to modify a formal testacy order under \u00a7 72-3-317(4), MCA?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b178-7\">\u00b623 In the District Court, Gail asserted \u00a7 72-3-317(4), MCA, allows for modification of the Final Probate Order; thereby, allowing the 6 Point Document to be included in the order as a codicil to the will. Gail asserted in her motion and in her appeal that her previous counsel was grossly negligent regarding the introduction of the 6 Point Document to the District Court, that previous counsel was negligent in their unfamiliarity with Montana law, and that the Estates\u2019 Personal Representative breached his fiduciary duties by failing to present the 6 Point Document at the January 26, 2016 hearing. Gail asserted this created an appropriate circumstance to provide relief under \u00a7 72-3-317(4), MCA. The District Court denied Gail\u2019s claim, finding \u00a7 72-3-317(4), MCA, cannot be read separately from section 1 and Gail failed to satisfy either condition required in section 1 justifying relief. On appeal, Gail asserts this was error, as \u00a7 72-3-317(4), MCA, clearly stands alone as an avenue of relief, separate and apart from the statutes other sections.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-8\">\u00b624 When we interpret a statute, this Court\u2019s purpose is to implement the objective the Legislature sought to achieve. <em>In re Estate of Martelle, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>2001 MT 194, \u00b6 18, 306 Mont. 253, 32 P.3d 758. The court\u2019s role is to ascertain and declare what is in \u201cterms or in substance contained\u201d in a statute, and not to insert what is omitted or omit what is inserted. Section 1-2-101, MCA; <em>State v. Cooksey, </em>2012 MT 226, \u00b6 32, 366 Mont. 346, 286 P.3d 1174. The intent of a statute must be ascertained from a holistic survey of the statute\u2019s text, language, and structure. <em>State v. Triplett, </em>2008 MT 360, \u00b6 25, 346 Mont. 383, 195 P.3d 819. Legislative intent must first be determined from the plain words used in the statute, and when that is possible, no other means of interpretation are proper. <em>City of Missoula v. Cox, </em>2008 MT 364, \u00b6 9, 346 Mont. 422, 196 P.3d 452. Courts may not disregard the plain language of a statute. <em>Bank of America v. Ivey, </em>2010 MT 131, \u00b6 10, 356 Mont. 388, 234 P.3d 867.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-4\">\u00b625 Section 72-3-317, MCA, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-5\">Subject to appeal and subject to vacation as provided in 72-3-318 and this <em>section, a formal testacy order under 72-3-313 through 72-3-316, </em>including an order that the decedent left no valid will and determining heirs, <em>is final as to all persons with respect to all issues concerning the decedent\u2019s estate that the court considered or might have considered incident to its rendition relevant to the question of whether the decedent left a valid will and to the determination of heirs, </em>except that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-6\">(1) the court shall entertain a petition for modification or vacation of its order and probate of another will of the decedent if it is shown that the proponents of the later-offered will:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-7\">(a) were unaware of its existence at the time of the earlier proceeding; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-8\">(b) were unaware of the earlier proceeding and were given no notice of the proceeding, except by publication;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-9\">(2) if intestacy of all or part of the estate has been ordered, the determination of heirs of the decedent may be reconsidered if it is shown that one or more persons were omitted from the determination and it is also shown that the persons:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-10\">(a) were unaware of their relationship to the decedent;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-11\">(b) were unaware of the decedent\u2019s death; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-12\">(c) were given no notice of any proceeding concerning the decedent\u2019s estate, except by publication;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-13\">(3) a petition for vacation under either subsection (1) or (2) above must be filed prior to the earlier of the following time limits:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-14\">(a) if a personal representative has been appointed for the estate, the time of entry of any order approving final distribution of the estate or, if the estate is closed by statement, 6 months after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>the filing of the closing statement;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-5\">(b) whether or not a personal representative has been appointed for the estate of the decedent, the time prescribed by 72-3-122 when it is no longer possible to initiate an original proceeding to probate a will of the decedent;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-6\">(c) 12 months after the entry of the order sought to be vacated;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-7\">(4) the order originally rendered in the testacy proceeding may be modified or vacated, if appropriate under the circumstances, by the order of probate of the later-offered will or the order redetermining heirs. (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"aex-dedup-0\">\u00b626  The above quoted statute is clear that a formal testacy order is final with respect to all issues concerning the decedent\u2019s estate, including those issues which the court considered or might have considered, relevant to the question of whether the decedent left a valid will. It is equally clear that the court will not \u201centertain\u201d a modification or vacation request unless the petitioner can show she was either unaware of the later-offered wills existence at the time of the earlier proceeding or was unaware of the earlier proceeding and was given no notice of the proceeding. Section 72-3-317(1), MCA. By the terms of the statute, a court cannot issue an order of probate of a later-offered will without the proponent of such a document satisfying either burden of \u00a7 72-3-317(1), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-10\">\u00b627 The District Court\u2019s interpretation of the statute is correct; \u00a7\u00a7 72-3-317(1)(a) and (4), MCA, are meant to be read together. Section 72-3-317, MCA, authorizes a modification or vacation from a formal testacy order under certain circumstances. Section 72-3-317(1)(a), MCA, requires the court to entertain a petition for modification or vacation, when the proponent of a later-offered will of the decedent, was either \u201cunaware of its existence at the time of the earlier proceeding\u201d or \u201cunaware of the earlier proceeding and were given no notice of the proceeding, except by publication.\u201d Then, if the required showing is sufficient under \u00a7 72-3-317(1), MCA, the court may modify or vacate the original probate order through the order of probate of the later-offered will, if appropriate. Section 72-3-317(4), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"A-k\">\u00b628  Gail does not assert she would be successful under \u00a7 72-3-317, MCA, if it required a showing of either condition in \u00a7 72-3-317(1), MCA. The factual record shows Gail and her counsel were both aware of the 6 Point Document and the hearing. The District Court correctly determined that Gail had failed to carry the burden necessary to seek relief under \u00a7 72-3-317(4), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-12\">\u00b629 <em>Issue Three: Did the District Court err in denying Gail\u2019s request for imposition of a constructive trust </em>?</p>\n<p id=\"b181-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>\u00b630 Gail argues the Court should impose a constructive trust for her benefit; without imposition of a constructive trust, the decedent\u2019s children would be unjustly enriched and the decedent\u2019s express testamentary intent would be denied. The District Court determined that based on the facts in this case, Gail is not entitled to the equitable remedy of a constructive trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">\u00b631 In her petition to be the Personal Representative, Gail represented to the District Court that she \u201cexercised reasonable diligence to determine if Decedent died testate and is unaware of any unrevoked testamentary instrument relating to property having situs in Montana.\u201d Gail filed a creditor claim against the Estate based on the 6 Point Document. When her claim was denied, Gail then sought to have the Formal Order of Probate modified or vacated to include the 6 Point Document based on its testamentary intent. The court denied Gail\u2019s claim, finding Gail created the error of which she complains based on her legal strategy. The Decedent\u2019s children and Personal Representative oppose the imposition of a constructive trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">\u00b632 A constructive trust serves as a proper remedy to unjust enrichment. A constructive trust arises when a person holding title to property is subject to an equitable duty to convey it to another on the ground that the person holding title would be unjustly enriched if the holder were permitted to retain it. Section 72-38-123, MCA. However, a party cannot expect equitable relief unless she comes into court with clean hands. <em>Schindler v. United Servs. Auto. Ass\u2019n, </em>2011 MT 129, \u00b6 24, 360 Mont. 528, 254 P.3d 583. Gail had knowledge of and exclusive control of the 6 Point Document when she filed her temporary intestacy petition and represented to the District Court that she was \u201cunaware of any unrevoked testamentary instrument.\u201d The District Court and the Personal Representative for the Estate relied on Gail\u2019s representations when creating the Probate Order and Gail did not object to the Probate Order. Gail cannot now expect an equitable remedy in order to avoid the alleged wrong, the handling of the 6 Point Document.</p>\n<p id=\"AhZ\">\u00b633  The District Court found sufficient grounds to deny the imposition of a constructive trust. The District Court did not misapprehend the facts, nor did the District Court err in its interpretation of law. The District Court\u2019s denial of an imposition of a constructive trust was not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-8\">\u00b634 <em>Issue Four: Is the Personal Representative entitled to attorney fees and costs pursuant to \u00a7 72-12-206, MCA?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b181-9\">\u00b635 The Personal Representative (PR) seeks attorney fees under \u00a7 72-12-206, MCA. Gail asserts attorney fees should be denied because Gail <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>did not contest the \u201cvalidity or probate of the will,\u201d the District Court impliedly denied an award of attorney fees, and that the PR\u2019s request for attorney fees is untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">\u00b636 A motion for attorney fees filed after entry of a judgment is treated as a motion to alter or amend a judgment. <em>Associated Press v. Crofts, </em>2004 MT 120, \u00b6 36, 321 Mont. 193, 89 P.3d 971. M. R. Civ. P. 59(d) controls a motion to alter or amend a judgment and the motion must be filed within twenty-eight days of entry of judgment. However, once an appeal is filed, the District Court no longer has jurisdiction over a case. <em>Powder River Cnty. v. State, </em>2002 MT 259, \u00b6\u00b6 27-28, 312 Mont. 198, 60 P.3d 357. \u201cAfter notice has been filed, the District Court retains jurisdiction only to correct clerical errors and jurisdiction over ancillary matters, as well as some jurisdiction over matters involving appeal such as undertaking of costs, stay of judgment, and matters involving transcript on appeal.\u201d <em>Powder River Cnty., </em>\u00b6 27 (citing <em>Powers Mfg. Co. v. Leon Jacobs Enterprises, </em>216 Mont. 407, 411, 701 P.2d 1377, 1380 (1985)).</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">\u00b637 Here, the PR filed the Notice of Entry of Order on January 27, 2017; the PR had until February 24, 2017, to file his motion for attorney fees. However, Gail filed an appeal in this Court on February 16, 2017, before the twenty-eight days to file a M. R. Civ. P. 59(e) motion to amend or alter the judgment seeking attorney fees expired. Thus, the PR was prevented from filing a motion to amend or alter seeking attorney fees in the District Court after February 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-7\">\u00b638 However, after an opposing party files a timely appeal, the petitioner may file a cross-appeal within fifteen days; which is exactly what the PR did here. M. R. App. P. 4; <em>Neumann v. Rogstad, </em>232 Mont. 24, 29, 757 P.2d 761, 765 (1988). Gail filed her appeal on February 16, 2017, the PR filed his cross-appeal on March 1, 2017. The PR\u2019s cross-motion for attorney fees is properly before this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-8\">\u00b639 Next, we must determine if the PR is entitled to attorney fees under \u00a7 72-12-206, MCA, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-9\">Fees and expenses\u2014by whom paid. When the validity or probate of a will is contested through court action, the attorney fees and costs, as provided in 25-10-201, incurred in defending the validity or probate of the will must be paid by the party contesting the validity or probate of the will if the will in probate is confirmed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Auh\">\u00b640  The PR argues that he is entitled to fees pursuant to the statutory criteria: he defended the probate of a contested will, and the will was confirmed. Gail asserts that she did not contest the probate of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>a will, but instead moved for relief from the F ormal Probate Order. We disagree. While Gail did not initially contest the probate of the Will and Codicil, after her creditor\u2019s claim was denied, Gail challenged the Final Probate Order. Gail\u2019s motion to amend or alter is predicated on the argument that the current probate of the Will and Codicil is incorrect and that the 6 Point Document is a second codicil. The PR contested the 6 Point Document as a second codicil while defending the probate of the Will and Codicil. <em>In re Estate of Edwards, </em>2017 MT 93, \u00b6\u00b6 85-90, 387 Mont. 274, 393 P.3d 639. The PR defended the probate of the Will pursuant to Gail\u2019s motion, and the Will and Codicil in probate were confirmed. If a party successfully defends a will, he is entitled to both attorney fees and costs. <em>In re Estate of Edwards, </em>\u00b6 87. The PR is entitled to attorney fees and costs under \u00a7 72-12-206, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">\u00b641 The District Court\u2019s interpretation of the statutes is correct. Under the facts of this case, a motion for relief from a formal testacy ordermustbe considered under \u00a7 72-3-317, MCA. Section 72-3-317(1), (1)(a) and (4), MCA, are meant to be read together in order to determine if a proponent of a later-offered will can modify or vacate the final probate order. Gail failed to make the necessary showing under \u00a7 72-3-317(1), MCA, to justify relief from the final probate order. The District Court correctly determined that Gail had failed to carry the burden necessary to seek relief under \u00a7 72-3-317(4), MCA. The District Court\u2019s denial of an imposition of a constructive trust was not clearly erroneous. The Personal Representative is entitled to costs and fees under \u00a7 72-12-206, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-7\">\u00b642 Affirmed and remanded to the District Court for determination of reasonable costs and fees.</p>\n<judges id=\"b183-8\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES McKINNON, SHEA and RICE concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b178-9\"> <em>See Mathieson v.
