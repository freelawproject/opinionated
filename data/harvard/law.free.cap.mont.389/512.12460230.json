Relying on <em>Miller v. Alabama, </em>567 U.S. 460, 132 S. Ct. 2455 (2012), and <em>Montgomery v. </em>Louisiana, _ U.S. _, 136 S. Ct. 718 (2016), Steilman argues that his sentence of 110 years imprisonment, without the possibility of parole, for deliberate homicide with the use of a weapon, violates his Eighth Amendment rights because Steilman committed the offense when he was seventeen years old and the sentencing court failed to consider the special circumstances of his youth.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-13\">\u00b62 We address the following issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-14\"><em>Issue One: Whether </em>Miller <em>and </em>Montgomery <em>apply to Montana\u2019s discretionary sentencing scheme.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-15\"><em>Issue Two: Whether Steilman\u2019s sentence qualifies as a de facto life sentence to which </em>Miller <em>and </em>Montgomery <em>apply.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b539-16\">\u00b63 We hold that <em>Miller </em>and <em>Montgomery </em>apply to discretionary sentences in Montana. Regarding the applicability to de facto life sentences in Montana, the dispositive issue in this case is whether the unique circumstances of Steilman\u2019s Montana sentence, when viewed in light of his eligibility for day-for-day good time credit and the concurrent sentence he is presently serving in Washington, qualifies as a de facto life sentence to which <em>Miller\u2019s </em>substantive rule applies. We conclude that Steilman\u2019s sentence does not qualify as a de facto life sentence, and therefore we do not reach the merits of whether the District Court properly considered the special circumstances of Steilman\u2019s youth in this case as required by <em>Miller. </em>We deny Steilman\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">\u00b64 On the night of September 17-18, 1996, Steilman and his accomplice, Steven Francis, made a pact to kill someone as a show of trust before pursuing a criminal enterprise together that included a planned bank robbery. Steilman and Francis randomly crossed paths with Paul Bischke. Steilman and Francis demanded Bischke\u2019s money, then struck him at least four times in the head, face, and arms with a crow bar, killing him. At the time he committed this murder, Steilman was 17 years and 323 days old, six weeks before his eighteenth birthday.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-7\">\u00b65 Steilman then moved to Tacoma, Washington, where nearly two years later, on or about September 10, 1998, he killed Jack Davis by beating Davis with a baseball bat. Within a week, Steilman and his then-girlfriend Colleen Wood were arrested in Butte in connection with the Washington homicide. Wood reported that Steilman took her to Davis\u2019s apartment to show her Davis\u2019s body. Another former girlfriend of Steilman\u2019s told law enforcement that he admitted to killing someone and acted \u201cas if it was nothing,\u201d but she waited to contact law enforcement because Steilman threatened to kill her. The presentence investigation report provided Steilman dropped out of school before the tenth grade in large part due to drug and alcohol abuse, which started when he was thirteen. The report also provided that Steilman surrounded himself with \u201cfriends and acquaintances [who] were almost all using drugs and alcohol and living a criminal lifestyle to support their addictions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b540-8\">\u00b66 On October 5, 1998, the State charged Steilman with deliberate homicide. The prosecution commenced in Youth Court because Steilman was under eighteen when he committed the first murder. The State moved to transfer Steilman\u2019s case to District Court. The Youth Court found: Steilman was seventeen years old when he committed the offense; probable cause existed; the delinquent act constituted deliberate homicide; the gravity of the offense and protection of the community required treatment beyond that afforded by juvenile facilities; the offense was committed in an aggressive and violent manner; and \u00a7 41-5-206(3) (1995), MCA, required transfer to the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-9\">\u00b67 Following the transfer to District Court, Steilman was returned to Washington for prosecution of Davis\u2019s murder. He pled guilty to first degree murder and was sentenced to 260 months of incarceration plus 24 months for the use of a weapon, totaling 23 years, 8 months. As an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>inmate of the State of Washington, Steilman was returned on a detainer order to be prosecuted in Montana for Bischke\u2019s murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">\u00b68 On October 1, 1999, Steilman pled guilty to deliberate homicide. On October 15, 1999, the District Court sentenced Steilman to the Montana State Prison for 100 years for deliberate homicide and 10 years for the use of a weapon, to run consecutively. The District Court reasoned that \u201cthe gravity and random nature of the murder ... [,Steilman\u2019s] commission of another homicide, the punishment permitted by law and the possibility, or lack thereof, of rehabilitation\u201d justified the 110-year sentence. The District Court also ordered Steilman ineligible for parole, remarking the \u201ccommission of a senseless, brutal, random homicide demonstrates that [Steilman] is not a suitable candidate for parole or other supervised release.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">\u00b69 Steilman\u2019s Montana sentence is eligible for day-for-day good time allowance, which, contingent upon his behavior in prison, could make him eligible for release in 55 years. Section 53-30-105, MCA (1995); <em>see Wilcock v. State, </em>No. OP 11-0442, 362 Mont. 544, 272 P.3d 125 (table) (Sept. 13, 2011). Also, the District Court ordered Steilman\u2019s 110-year prison term to run concurrent with his 23 years, 8 months Washington sentence. Under Washington law, Steilman is required to serve at least two-thirds of his sentence before he would be eligible for community release.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b541-8\">\u00b610 Section 46-22-101, MCA, provides \u201cevery person imprisoned or otherwise restrained of liberty within this state may prosecute a writ of habeas corpus to inquire into the cause of imprisonment or restraint and, if illegal, to be delivered from the imprisonment or restraint.\u201d Article II, Section 19 of the Montana Constitution guarantees the writ of habeas corpus shall never be suspended. The writ of habeas corpus is available to challenge the legality of the sentence; however, it is not available to attack the validity of the conviction or sentence of a person who has been adjudged guilty of an offense in a court of record and has exhausted the remedy of appeal. Sections 46-21-101(1), -22-101(2), <em>MCA, Rudolph v. Day, </em>273 Mont. 309, 311, 902 P.2d 1007, 1008 (1995). The exception for filing habeas petitions to challenge a facially invalid sentence is generally limited to invalidity that \u201cstems from a rule created after time limits for directly appealing or petitioning for postconviction relief have expired.\u201d <em>Beach v. State, </em>2015 MT 118, \u00b6 6, 379 Mont. 74, 348 P.3d 629 <em>(citing Lott v. State, </em>2006 MT 279, \u00b6 22, 334 Mont. 270, 150 P.3d 337). A petitioner who successfully challenges a sentence by way of habeas corpus, but not the underlying conviction, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>is not entitled to be released, but only to be resentenced. <em>Lott, </em>\u00b6 23. If the illegal portion of a sentence \u201caffects the entire sentence\u201d and we are unable to discern what the district court would have done if it had properly applied the law, we remand for resentencing. <em>State v. Heath, </em>2005 MT 280, \u00b6 7, 329 Mont. 226, 123 P.2d 228.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">\u00b611 <em>Issue One: Whether </em>Miller <em>and </em>Montgomery <em>apply to Montana\u2019s discretionary sentencing scheme.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">\u00b612 The State argues that Steilman\u2019s sentence is not facially invalid and habeas relief is not available because the sentencing court had the constitutional authority to impose the sentence. The State contends that <em>Miller\u2019s </em>rules only apply to sentencing schemes mandating life without parole for juvenile offenders, and that the \u201cmandatory sentencing rule has no application in Montana.\u201d <em>See Beach, </em>\u00b6 36. The State further contends that <em>Miller </em>merely requires the sentencing court to follow a certain process before imposing a life without parole sentence on a juvenile, and does not \u201cforeclose a sentencer\u2019s ability to make that judgment in homicide cases.\u201d <em>Miller, </em>567 U.S. at 480, 132 S. Ct. at 2469. According to the State, under <em>Miller </em>a sentencing court retains the constitutional authority to sentence a juvenile to life without parole; therefore, as a matter of law, such a sentence cannot be facially invalid under <em>Lott. See Beach, </em>\u00b6 38; <em>Lott, </em>\u00b6 22. We disagree, and are satisfied that Steilman sufficiently calls into question the facial validity of his sentence because <em>Montgomery </em>announced that <em>Miller </em>applies retroactively and effectively overruled our holding in <em>Beach. </em>Montgomery, _ U.S. at _, 136 S. Ct. at 734.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-8\">\u00b613 The Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article II, Section 22 of the Montana Constitution provide: \u201cExcessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted.\u201d The U.S. Supreme Court dictates that courts must interpret the Eighth Amendment \u201caccording to its text, by considering history, tradition, and precedent, and with due regard for its purpose and function in the constitutional design\u201d and refer to \u201c \u2018the evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society\u2019 to determine which punishments are so disproportionate as to be cruel and <em>unusual.\u201d Roper v. Simmons, </em>543 U.S. 551, 560-61, 125 S. Ct. 1183, 1190 (2005) (quoting <em>Trop v. Dulles, </em>356 U.S. 86, 100-101, 78 S. Ct. 590, 598 (1958) (plurality opinion)). The Eighth Amendment prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment \u201cflows from the basic \u2018precept of justice that punishment for crime should be graduated and proportioned to the offense.\u2019 <em>\u2019\u2019 Roper, </em>543 U.S. at 560, 125 S. Ct. at 1190 (quoting <em>Atkins v. Virginia, </em>536 U.S. 304, 311, 122 S. Ct. 2242 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>(2002)). \u201cWhile in practice the concept of proportionality does not affect most sentences, proportionality bears on the harshest types of punishments when an Eighth Amendment challenge is raised.\u201d <em>Beach, </em>\u00b6 8 (citing <em>Ewing v. California, </em>538 U.S. 11, 123 S. Ct. 1179 (2003)) (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">\u00b614 Through a series of decisions over the last dozen years, the U.S. Supreme Court has made clear that \u201cchildren are constitutionally different from adults for purposes of sentencing\u201d under the Eighth Amendment. <em>See Montgomery, </em>_ U.S. _, 136 S. Ct. at 732-733 (holding that <em>Miller\u2019s </em>procedural requirements to consider characteristics of youth when sentencing juvenile offenders provides a substantive rule that applies <em>retroactively); Miller, </em>567 U.S. at 470-71, 132 S. Ct. at 2463-64 (holding the Eighth Amendment forbids a sentencing scheme that mandates life without the possibility of parole for juvenile offenders); <em>Graham v. Florida, </em>560 U.S. 48, 68, 130 S. Ct. 2011, 2026 (2010) (holding the Eighth Amendment categorically forbids sentences of life without parole for juveniles convicted of nonhomicide offenses); <em>Roper, </em>543 U.S. at 575, 125 S. Ct. at 1198 (holding capital punishment unconstitutional for juvenile offenders).</p>\n<p id=\"b543-8\">\u00b615 The U.S. Supreme Court identified three primary differences between adult and juvenile offenders:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-9\">First, children have a \u201clack of maturity and an underdeveloped sense of responsibility,\u201d leading to recklessness, impulsivity, and heedless risk-taking. Second, children \u201care more vulnerable to negative influences and outside pressures,\u201d including from their family and peers; they have limited \u201ccontrol over their own environment\u201d and lack the ability to extricate themselves from horrific, crime-producing settings. And third, a child\u2019s character is not as \u201cwell formed\u201d as an adult\u2019s; his traits are \u201cless fixed\u201d and his actions less likely to be \u201cevidence of irretrievable depravity.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b543-10\">Montgomery, _ U.S. at _, 136 S. Ct. at 733 <em>(quoting Miller, </em>567 U.S. at 471, 132 S. Ct. at 2464) (alterations, citations, and some internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cThese differences render suspect any conclusion that a juvenile falls among the worst offenders.\u201d <em>Roper, </em>543 U.S. at 570, 125 S. Ct. at 1195. The Court admitted the difficulty, even for expert psychologists, \u201cto differentiate between the juvenile offender whose crime reflects unfortunate yet transient immaturity, and the rare juvenile offender whose crime reflects irreparable corruption.\u201d <em>Roper, </em>543 U.S. at 573, 125 S. Ct. at 1197. The Court acknowledged the inherent \u201cdifferences [that] result from children\u2019s \u2018diminished culpability and greater prospects for reform,\u2019 \u201d and that \u201c \u2018the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>distinctive attributes of youth diminish the penological justifications\u2019 for imposing life without parole on juvenile offenders.\u201d <em>Montgomery, </em>_ U.S. _, 136 S. Ct. at 733 (quoting <em>Miller, </em>567 U.S. at 461, 132 S. Ct. at 2465). The Court reiterated that \u201cyouth matters in determining the appropriateness of a lifetime of incarceration without the possibility of parole.\u201d <em>Miller, </em>567 U.S. at 473, 132 S. Ct. at 2465. In so doing, <em>Miller </em>barred life without parole for all but the rarest juvenile offenders whose crimes reflect permanent incorrigibility. <em>Montgomery, </em>_ U.S. at _, 136 S. Ct. at 734.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-7\">\u00b616 The <em>Miller </em>Court outlined five factors of mandatory sentencing schemes that \u201cprevent the sentencer from considering youth and from assessing whether the law\u2019s harshest term of imprisonment proportionately punishes a juvenile offender.\u201d <em>Miller, </em>567 U.S. at 461-62, 132 S. Ct. at 2458.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-8\">Mandatory life without parole for a juvenile [1] precludes consideration of his chronological age and its hallmark features\u2014among them, immaturity, impetuosity, and failure to appreciate risks and consequences. [2] It prevents taking into account the family and home environment that surrounds him\u2014and from which he cannot usually extricate himself\u2014no matter how brutal or dysfunctional. [3] It neglects the circumstances of the homicide offense, including the extent of his participation in the conduct and the way familial and peer pressures may have affected him. [4] Indeed, it ignores that he might have been charged and convicted of a lesser offense if not for incompetencies associated with youth\u2014for example, his inability to deal with police officers or prosecutors (including on a plea agreement) or his incapacity to assist his own attorneys. And [5] finally, this mandatory punishment disregards the possibility of rehabilitation even when the circumstances most suggest it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A7-\"><em>Miller, </em>567 U.S. at 477-78, 132 S. Ct. at 2468. Even though the <em>Miller </em>Court did not categorically bar sentences of life without parole for juveniles convicted of a homicide offense, the Court required sentencing judges \u201ctake into account how children are different, and how those differences counsel against irrevocably sentencing them to a lifetime in prison.\u201d <em>Miller, </em>567 U.S. at 480, 132 S. Ct. at 2469.</p>\n<p id=\"A_MA\">\u00b617  Steilman argues that the aspect that is cruel and unusual for juvenile offenders is the sentence of life without parole itself, not whether the scheme under which the sentence is imposed is mandatory. We agree. Discussing its rationale for treating juvenile offenders differently from adult offenders, the U.S. Supreme Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>explained that \u201ca lifetime in prison is a disproportionate sentence for all but the rarest of children, those whose crimes reflect \u2018irreparable corruption.\u2019 \u201d Montgomery, _ U.S. at _, 136 S. Ct. at 726 (quoting <em>Miller, </em>567 U.S. at 480, 132 S. Ct. at 2469). The Court further noted, <em>\u201cMiller </em>... did more than require a sentencer to consider a juvenile offender\u2019s youth before imposing life without parole; it established that the penological justifications for life without parole collapse in light of \u2018the distinctive attributes of youth.\u2019 \u201d Montgomery, _ U.S. at _, 136 S. Ct. at 734 (quoting <em>Miller, </em>567 U.S. at 472, 132 S. Ct. at 2465). In the same vein, the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals appropriately reasoned: \u201cThe relevance to sentencing of\u2018children are different\u2019 also cannot in logic depend on whether the legislature has made the life sentence discretionary or mandatory; even discretionary life sentences must be guided by consideration of age-relevant factors.\u201d <em>McKinley v. Butler, </em>809 F.3d 908, 911 (7th Cir. 2016). We conclude that <em>Miller\u2019s </em>substantive rule requires Montana\u2019s sentencing judges to adequately consider the mitigating characteristics of youth set forth in the <em>Miller </em>factors when sentencing juvenile offenders to life without the possibility of parole, irrespective of whether the life sentence was discretionary.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-9\">\u00b618 <em>Issue Two: Whether Steilman\u2019s sentence qualifies as a de facto life sentence to which </em>Miller <em>applies.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b545-10\">\u00b619 The State argues that because Montana law provides a distinction between sentences of life imprisonment, term-of-years, and death, a term-of-years sentence cannot become a de facto life sentence and equate to a de jure life imprisonment under Montana law. <em>See </em>\u00a7 45-5-102(2), MCA. The State contends Steilman\u2019s term of 110 years as a sentence is not the same as a life imprisonment sentence, and <em>Miller </em>only applies to life imprisonment. The State further contends no standard exists to determine how long a term-of-years must be before it becomes the equivalent of life imprisonment, and any term-of-years could be equivalent to life without parole if the offender dies while incarcerated. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-11\">\u00b620 The same principles that make <em>Miller </em>applicable to Montana\u2019s discretionary scheme similarly apply to a term-of-years sentence that is the practical equivalent of life without parole. A strict application of the State\u2019s argument would mean that a sentence that inarguably would not allow for the offender to ever be released could not be considered a life sentence so long as the sentence is expressed in years. Logically, the requirement to consider how \u201cchildren are different\u201d cannot be limited to de jure life sentences when a lengthy sentence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>denominated in a number of years will effectively result in the juvenile offender\u2019s imprisonment for life. <em>See McKinley, </em>809 F.3d at 911; <em>State v. Zuber, </em>152 A.3d 197 (N.J. 2017); <em>People v. Nieto, </em>52 N.E.3d 442 (Ill. App. Ct. 2016); <em>Kelly v. Brown, </em>851 F.3d 686 (7th Cir. 2017); <em>State v. Ramos, </em>387 P.3d 650 (Wash. 2017); <em>State v. Cardeilhac, </em>876 N.W.2d 876 (Neb. 2016); <em>People v. Cervantes, </em>9 Cal. App. 5th 569 (Cal. Ct. App. 2017); <em>Hayden v. Keller, </em>134 F.Supp.3d 1000 (E.D.N.C. 2015).</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">\u00b621 In <em>Graham, </em>upon which the <em>Miller </em>Court relied heavily, the Court reasoned that sentencing a juvenile non-homicide offender to life without parole violates the Eighth Amendment\u2019s rule against disproportionate sentences because it denies the juvenile offender a chance to demonstrate growth and maturity. <em>Graham, </em>560 U.S. at 73, 130 S. Ct. at 2029. The <em>Graham </em>Court did not focus on the precise sentence meted out, nor did it require the state to \u201cguarantee the offender eventual release, but if [the state] imposes a sentence of life it must provide him or her with some realistic opportunity to obtain release before the end of that term.\u201d <em>Graham, </em>560 U.S. at 82, 130 S. Ct. at 2034. Consonantly, the <em>Montgomery </em>Court dictated that children, who are constitutionally different from adults in their level of culpability, must be given the opportunity to show their crime did not reflect irreparable corruption, and if redeemable, their hope of release must be restored. Montgomery, _ U.S. at _, 136 S. Ct. at 736-37. As such, the rule in <em>Montgomery </em>\u201cdraws \u2018a line between children whose crimes reflect transient immaturity and those rare children whose crimes reflect irreparable corruption\u2019 and allows for the possibility \u2018that life without parole could be a proportionate sentence only for the latter kind of juvenile offender.\u2019 \u201d <em>Tatum v. </em>Arizona, _ U.S. _, _, 137 S. Ct. 11, 12 (2016) (Sotomayor, J., concurring) (quoting Montgomery, _ U.S. at _, 136 S. Ct. at 734). <em>Montgomery </em>and <em>Graham </em>illustrate the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s inexorable evolution recognizing that all but the rarest juvenile offenders be given an opportunity for redemption and a hope of release, which a sentence of life without parole cannot provide. As it pertains to the specific sentence imposed on Steilman, however, our analysis cannot end here.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-12\">\u00b622 The dispositive question remaining is whether the sentence imposed on Steilman does, in fact, constitute a de facto life sentence that triggers the Eighth Amendment protections set forth in <em>Montgomery </em>and <em>Miller. </em>We begin with the practical application of Steilman\u2019s sentence. As the State points out, because Steilman is eligible for day-for-day good time credit, his 110-year sentence allows for his release after serving only 55 years, contingent upon his behavior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>in prison. Section 53-30-105, MCA (1995) (repealed 1997). Let us assume, for the sake of argument, that a sentence imposed upon a twenty-one year old man, which allows for the possibility of release in 55 years, constitutes a de facto life sentence. We nevertheless cannot ignore the reality that Steilman\u2019s Montana sentence was imposed to run concurrent with the Washington sentence he was already serving for the murder he committed as an adult in Washington, thus giving Steilman credit towards his Montana sentence for time served on a wholly unrelated murder in Washington.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">\u00b623 The Eighth Amendment prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment \u201cflows from the basic \u2018precept of justice that punishment for crime should be graduated and proportioned to the offense.\u2019 <em>\u2019\u2019 Roper, </em>543 U.S. at 560, 125 S. Ct. at 1190. After factoring in both the day-for-day good time credit to which Steilman is eligible, and the credit he gets towards his Montana sentence while serving his concurrent sentence in Washington, Steilman could potentially serve as little as 31.33 years exclusively attributed towards Bischke\u2019s murder. Had the Montana District Court imposed a sentence that allowed for the possibility of Steilman\u2019s release after serving as little as 31.33 years, but ordered the sentence to run <em>consecutive </em>to his Washington sentence, Steilman would be hard pressed to argue that such a sentence was disproportionate to the horrific crime he committed. In that circumstance, such a sentence would simply reflect a proportionate sentence independently imposed for a crime independently committed. And yet this is precisely the practical effect of the sentence Steilman actually received. Steilman was not entitled to a concurrent sentence in this case. Nevertheless, the District Court, in its discretion, elected to run his Montana sentence concurrent with his Washington sentence, inuring considerably to Steilman\u2019s benefit. If we were to ignore the practical effect of Steilman\u2019s sentence, we would be allowing him to reap that benefit while disregarding it for purposes of assessing the proportionality of his Montana sentence. Determining whether a sentence is cruel and unusual does not require us to ignore reality.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"ami-dedup-0\">\u00b624  The combination of the good-time credit to which Steilman is eligible and the amount of his sentence that will be discharged while serving a sentence on a wholly unrelated crime leads us to conclude that Steilman\u2019s sentence does not trigger Eighth Amendment protections under <em>Montgomery, Miller, </em>and <em>Graham. </em>Therefore, we do not reach the question of whether the District Court failed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>adequately consider Steilman\u2019s youth under <em>Miller </em>and <em>Montgomery </em>when sentencing him.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">\u00b625 The petition for writ of habeas corpus is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-7\">DATED this 13th day of December, 2017.</p>\n<judges id=\"b548-8\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES BAKER and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b548-9\">JUSTICE WHEAT,</author>\n<p id=\"asm-dedup-0\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-10\">\u00b626 I concur with the Court\u2019s determination that <em>Miller </em>and <em>Montgomery </em>apply to Montana\u2019s discretionary sentencing scheme and that a lengthy term-of-years sentence could invoke <em>Miller </em>if the sentence is the practical equivalent of life without parole. However, I respectfully dissent from the majority\u2019s decision that Steilman\u2019s sentence does not qualify as a life sentence without parole sufficient to implicate <em>Miller. </em>In my opinion, Steilman\u2019s sentence invokes Miller; therefore, I would grant Steilman\u2019s petition for a writ of habeas corpus and vacate the parole restriction.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-11\">\u00b627 The underlying principles of the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Miller v. Alabama, </em>567 U.S. 460, 132 S. Ct. 2455 (2012), and <em>Montgomery v. </em>Louisiana, _ U.S. _, 136 S. Ct. 718 (2016), are that \u201cchildren are constitutionally different from adults for purposes of sentencing\u201d and \u201chave diminished culpability and greater prospects for reform.\u201d <em>Miller, </em>567 U.S. at 471, 132 S. Ct. at 2464. The \u201cimposition of a State\u2019s most severe penalties on juvenile offenders cannot proceed as though they were not children.\u201d <em>Miller, </em>567 U.S. at 474, 132 S. Ct. at 2466. <em>Montgomery </em>echoed the same concerns: \u201cIn light of what this Court has said in <em>Roper, Graham, </em>and <em>Miller </em>about how children are constitutionally different from adults in their level of culpability, ... prisoners like Montgomery must be given the opportunity to show their crime did not reflect irreparable corruption; and, if it did not, their hope for some years of life outside prison walls must be restored.\u201d <em>Montgomery, </em>_ U.S. at _, 136 S. Ct. at 736-37. Although the majority reiterates many of these principles, it nevertheless rejects their application where a seventeen-year-old was sentenced to the practical equivalent of life without parole. Consequently, Steilman was never and will never be given an opportunity to show that his crime did not reflect irreparable corruption. Such result is contrary to the principles set forth in <em>Miller </em>and <em>Montgomery.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b548-16\">\u00b628 The majority erred in concluding that a seventeen-year-old sentenced to 110 years without the possibility of parole, with a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>conditional minimum sentence of 55 years, is outside the scope of <em>Miller. Miller\u2019s </em>command that a sentencing judge \u201ctake into account how children are different, and how those differences counsel against irrevocably sentencing them to a lifetime in prison,\u201d applies with equal strength to a sentence that is the practical equivalent of life without parole. <em>Miller, </em>567 U.S. at 480, 132 S. Ct. at 2469. Therefore, states have held that lengthy term-of-years sentences imposed on juveniles, similar to Steilman\u2019s sentence in this case, are sufficient to trigger the protections of <em>Miller </em>under the United States and state Constitutions. <em>See Casiano v. Comm\u2019r of Corr., </em>317 Conn. 52, 115 A.3d 1031, 1044 (Conn. 2015), <em>cert. denied, Semple v. </em>Casiano, _ U.S. _, 136 S. Ct. 1364 (2016) (50-year sentence without possibility of parole is subject to <em>Miller); Iowa v. Null, </em>836 N.W.2d 41, 71 (Iowa 2013) (minimum sentence of 52.5 years imprisonment invokes <em>Miller); New Jersey v. Zuber, </em>227 N.J. 422, 452, 152 A.3d 197, 215 (N.J. 2017) (110-year sentence with 55 years of parole ineligibility implicates <em>Miller); Bear Cloud v. Wyoming, </em>2014 WY 113, 334 P.3d 132, 141-42 (Wyo. 2014) (holding that an aggregate sentence of more than 45 years was de facto life without parole and was barred by <em>Miller).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b549-7\">\u00b629 Here, Steilman\u2019s sentence should trigger <em>Miller and Montgomery </em>protections. The District Court sentenced Steilman to the maximum number of years pursuant to \u00a7 45-5-201, MCA (1995), and \u00a7 46-18-221, MCA (1995), which is the practical equivalent of life without parole. Thus, Steilman\u2019s multiple term-of-years sentence, in all likelihood, will keep him in jail for the majority of his life without the possibility of release until he is well into his seventies.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-8\">\u00b630 Additionally, the majority incorrectly focuses on the fact that Steilman\u2019s sentence is subject to day-to-day credits to conclude that his sentence does not implicate <em>Miller. </em>Opinion, \u00b6 22. However, a conditional release based on day-to-day credits is not determined by a district court, but rather is determined by the Montana Department of Corrections. This Court should consider the actual sentence imposed on Steilman, not a sentence that is subjectively determined by an entity other than the District Court. And despite the majority\u2019s conclusion, there is no guarantee that Steilman will be released after 55 years. Therefore, although Steilman\u2019s sentence may be subject to day-to-day credit, it should not negate the fact that the sentencing judge sentenced Steilman to the practical equivalent of life without parole: 110 years without the possibility of parole. Thus, I would conclude that Steilman\u2019s sentence would constitute a de facto life sentence and habeas corpus relief is appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>\u00b631 Because Steilman\u2019s sentence is subject to <em>Miller </em>and <em>Montgomery, </em>I would strike the parole restriction. The United States Supreme Court emphasized that by giving <em>Miller </em>retroactive effect \u201c[a] State may remedy a <em>Miller </em>violation by permitting juvenile homicide offenders to be considered for parole, rather than by resentencing them.\u201d <em>Montgomery, </em>_ U.S. at _, 136 S. Ct. at 736. Such remedy is appropriate here. It would allow Steilman to be considered for parole, which \u201censures that juveniles whose crimes reflected only transient immaturity\u2014and who have since matured\u2014will not be forced to serve a disproportionate sentence in violation of the Eighth Amendment.\u201d <em>Montgomery, </em>_ U.S. at _, 136 S. Ct. at 736. Further, allowing Steilman parole eligibility would permit the parole board to evaluate whether Steilman \u201cdemonstrated the truth of <em>Miller\u2019s </em>central intuition\u2014that children who commit even heinous crimes are capable of change.\u201d <em>Montgomery, </em>_ U.S. at _, 136 S. Ct. at 736. Thus, striking the parole restriction would provide Steilman with the meaningful opportunity for release that <em>Miller </em>and <em>Montgomery </em>mandate of juvenile homicide offenders, provided he does not reflect irreparable corruption.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-11\">\u00b632 Accordingly, I would amend Steilman\u2019s sentence by striking the parole restriction because his sentence of 110 years without the possibility of parole implicates <em>Miller. </em>Then, the parole board could properly consider Steilman\u2019s \u201cyouth and attendant characteristics\u201d at the time of his crime and his development and behavior during incarceration. Conversely, Steilman could be re-sentenced or given a <em>Miller </em>hearing to ensure that his sentence does not upset the concerns enunciated by the United States Supreme Court regarding the culpability of juvenile offenders and these offenders\u2019 potential for growth and maturity.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-12\">\u00b633 For these reasons, I dissent from the Court\u2019s denial of Steilman\u2019s petition.</p>\n<judges id=\"b550-13\">JUSTICE SANDEFER joins in the Dissent of JUSTICE WHEAT.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b550-14\">JUSTICE MCKINNON,</author>\n<p id=\"Aa9j\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-15\">\u00b634 In <em>Beach, </em>this Court considered the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s pronouncement in <em>Miller, </em>that \u201ca sentencer follow a <em>certain process </em>\u2014considering an offender\u2019s youth and attendant characteristics\u2014before imposing a particular <em>penalty.\u201d Miller, </em>567 U.S. at 483, 132 S. Ct. at 2471 (emphasis added). The Court was asked to decide whether <em>Miller </em>applied to a state collateral proceeding thus requiring Beach to be resentenced. I specially concurred in <em>Beach, </em>concluding Montana\u2019s individualized and discretionary sentencing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>scheme already required a sentencing court to consider a defendant\u2019s individual needs, characteristics, family environment, and prospects for rehabilitation\u2014including age. In my opinion, it was significant that <em>Miller </em>had been decided within the context of a mandatory statutory sentencing scheme, which did not allow for imposition of a sentence less than life without parole for first degree murder, regardless of the age of the offender at the time the crime was committed. I also concluded that pursuant to Montana\u2019s habeas corpus statute, \u00a7 46-22-101(2), MCA, and our holding in <em>Lott, </em>Beach was precluded from attacking his facially valid conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">\u00b635 Following this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Beach, </em>the U.S. Supreme Court decided <em>Montgomery. </em>In my opinion, <em>Montgomery </em>does not simply decide whether a \u201ccertain process\u201d required by <em>Miller </em>is to be applied retroactively, <em>Montgomery </em>actually rewrites and expands the pronouncements made in <em>Miller. </em>In <em>Montgomery, </em>the Court stated that <em>Miller </em>\u201crendered life without parole an unconstitutional penalty for a class of defendants because of their status\u2014that is, juvenile offenders whose crimes reflect the transient immaturity of youth.\u201d <em>Montgomery, </em>_ U.S. at _, 136 S. Ct. at 734 (internal quotations and citation omitted). The <em>Montgomery </em>Court described its holding in <em>Miller </em>as barring sentences of life without parole \u201cfor all but the rarest of juvenile offenders, those whose crimes reflect permanent incorrigibility.\u201d Montgomery, _ U.S. at _, 136 S. Ct. at 734. The <em>Montgomery </em>Court explained, \u201c[t]he only difference bet ween .Roper and <em>Graham, </em>on the one hand, and <em>Miller, </em>on the other, is <em>that Miller </em>drew a line between children whose crimes reflect transient immaturity and those rare children whose crimes reflect irreparable corruption.\u201d Montgomery, _ U.S. at _, 136 S. Ct. at 734. The <em>Montgomery </em>Court held that <em>\u201cMiller, </em>then, did more than require a sentencer to consider a juvenile offender\u2019s youth before imposing life without parole; it established that the penological justifications for life without parole collapse in light of\u2018the distinctive attributes of youth.\u2019 \u201d <em>Montgomery, </em>_ U.S. at _, 136 S. Ct. at 734 (quoting <em>Miller, </em>567 U.S. at 472, 132 S. Ct. at 2465).</p>\n<p id=\"b551-14\">\u00b636 The difficulty presented in the instant proceedings is that the attributions of the <em>Montgomery </em>Court to its <em>Miller </em>decision do not appear in <em>Miller. </em>In fact, <em>Miller </em>stated: \u201cOur decision does not categorically bar a penalty for a class of offenders or type of crime-as, for example, we did in <em>Roper </em>or <em>Graham. </em>Instead, it mandates only that a sentencer <em>follow a certain </em>process-considering an offender\u2019s youth and attendant characteristics-before imposing a particular <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>penalty.\u201d <em>Miller, </em>567 U.S. at 483, 132 S. Ct. at 2471 (emphasis added). Throughout <em>Miller, </em>the constitutional error focused on the mandatory nature of the sentence imposed. Thus, <em>Miller </em>held that <em>mandatory </em>life without parole for juvenile homicide offenders violated the Eighth Amendment\u2019s prohibition on \u201ccruel and unusual punishments.\u201d <em>Miller, </em>567 U.S. at 465, 132 S. Ct. at 2460. \u201cBefore <em>Miller, every </em>juvenile convicted of a homicide in Alabama was sentenced to life without possibility of parole.\u201d Montgomery, _ U.S. at _, 136 S. Ct. at 734 (emphasis added). As <em>Miller </em>required that a sentencing court consider a youth offender\u2019s age, but did not expressly bar life without parole for all juveniles, <em>Miller\u2019s </em>application appeared limited when a statutory sentencing scheme allowed discretion to impose a sentence less than life without parole. In the wake of <em>Miller, </em>there has been considerable question across the country about whether it set forth a substantive or procedural rule, whether it applied to discretionary sentencing schemes, and whether its pronouncements were to be applied retroactively. Courts across the country reached different conclusions as to what <em>Miller </em>meant and required.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-7\">\u00b637 Whether characterized as a clarification or a rewrite of <em>Miller, Montgomery </em>now establishes that \u201c[e]ven if a court considers a child\u2019s age before sentencing him or her to a lifetime in prison, that sentence still violates the Eighth Amendment for a child whose crime reflects \u2018unfortunate yet transient immaturity.\u2019 \u201d Montgomery, _ U.S. at _, 136 S. Ct. at 734 (quoting <em>Miller, </em>567 U.S. at 479, 132 S. Ct. at 2469). \u201cA hearing where \u2018youth and its attendant characteristics\u2019 are considered as sentencing factors is necessary to <em>separate </em>those juveniles who may be sentenced to life without parole from those who may not\u201d and, therefore, give effect to <em>\u201cMiller\u2019s </em>substantive holding that life without parole is an excessive sentence for children whose crimes reflect transient immaturity.\u201d Montgomery, _ U.S. at _, 136 S. Ct. at 735 (quoting <em>Miller, </em>567 U.S. at 465, 132 S. Ct. at 2460) (emphasis added). Thus, <em>Montgomery </em>held that <em>Miller </em>rendered life without parole an <em>\u201cunconstitutional penalty </em>for... <em>the vast majority of juvenile offenders\u201d </em>because most of their crimes reflect the transient immaturity of youth. Montgomery, _ U.S. at _, 132 S. Ct. at 735 (citations omitted and emphasis added). <em>Montgomery </em>concluded that <em>Miller </em>had \u201cannounced a [new] substantive rule of constitutional law\u201d that had retroactive application. Montgomery, _ U.S. at _, 136 S. Ct. at 734.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-16\">\u00b638 Following <em>Montgomery, </em>the U.S. Supreme Court has issued orders vacating and remanding five Arizona state sentences of life without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>parole for crimes the offenders committed before they turned eighteen. <em>See </em>Tatum, _ U.S. _, 137 S. Ct. 11. Pursuant to <em>Miller, </em>Arizona has expressly considered the offender\u2019s youth as a mitigating factor, but still imposed life without parole based on the nature of the offense and the offender. Significantly, the sentences followed the Arizona Legislature\u2019s enactment of Ariz. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 13-716 in 2014, which provided discretion to the sentencing court to allow the possibility of release for a juvenile sentenced to life imprisonment, after serving a minimum number of calendar years. <em>See Arizona v. Vera, </em>334 P.3d 754, 756-58 (Arizona 2014). Based on Ariz. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 13-716, the sentences deemed unconstitutional in <em>Tatum </em>were imposed pursuant to a discretionary sentencing scheme. Although the U.S. Supreme Court in <em>Tatum </em>did not address the case on its merits, the orders are consistent with <em>Montgomery\u2019s </em>holding that unless a juvenile is a member of the exceptional and uncommon class of offenders whose crimes reflect irreparable corruption, a sentence of life without parole is unconstitutionally disproportionate under the Eighth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"aqx-dedup-1\">\u00b639 <em>Montgomery </em>is also significant in that it mandated, \u201cfor the first time,\u201d that \u201c[wjhere state collateral review proceedings permit prisoners to challenge the lawfulness of their confinement, States cannot refuse to give retroactive effect to a substantive constitutional right that determines the outcome of that challenge.\u201d Montgomery, _ U.S. at _, 136 S. Ct. at 731-32. The <em>Montgomery </em>Court determined that, under the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution, state collateral review courts must give retroactive effect to new substantive rules of constitutional law. Montgomery, _ U.S. at _, 136 S. Ct. at 731. Accordingly, a state\u2019s \u201ccollateral review procedures are open to claims that a decision of [the U.S. Supreme Court] has rendered certain sentences illegal, as a substantive matter, under the Eighth Amendment.\u201d Montgomery, _ U.S. at _, 136 S. Ct. at 732 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b553-14\">\u00b640 This Court is bound by <em>Montgomery </em>and its \u201cclarification\u201d of <em>Miller. Miller </em>identifies inherent problems when a sentencing court lacks discretion in mandatory sentencing schemes; sets forth factors highlighting the differences between youth and adults (this Court refers to five factors which must be considered, Opinion, \u00b6\u00b6 16-17); and enunciates a requirement that the age of the juvenile offender be adequately considered. <em>Montgomery, </em>however, sets forth a new substantive constitutional rule more sweeping than this Court recognizes; <em>Montgomery </em>categorically declares that the imposition of life without parole upon a juvenile offender is unconstitutional, carving <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>out only a small exception for those rare occasions when irreparable corruption has been demonstrated. That the unconstitutional sentence may have been imposed pursuant to a discretionary sentencing scheme is, therefore, of no consequence. <em>Montgomery </em>and <em>Miller </em>stand on equal footing with <em>Roper </em>and <em>Graham </em>in establishing that children are constitutionally different from adults in their level of culpability and in the way they may be constitutionally sentenced. However, <em>Montgomery </em>requires that evidence of \u201cirreparable corruption\u201d or \u201cpermanent incorrigibility\u201d be demonstrated, not just that the sentencing court considered and addressed various factors of youth. Montgomery, _ U.S. at _, 136 S. Ct. at 734. Montana\u2019s trial courts, as well as Montana\u2019s Legislature, should be so advised. \u201cWe leave to the States the task of developing appropriate ways to enforce the constitutional restriction upon their execution of sentences.\u201d Montgomery, _ U.S. at _, 136 S. Ct. at 735 (citation and alterations omitted). \u201cThat <em>Miller </em>did not impose a formal factfinding requirement does not leave States free to sentence a child whose crime reflects transient immaturity to life without parole.\u201d Montgomery, _ U.S. at _, 136 S. Ct. at 735.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-11\">\u00b641 Finally, courts tasked with resentencing must decide\u2014in many cases decades after the sentence imposed became final\u2014whether, at the time of commission of the offense, the offender fit within the class of juveniles who were irreparably corrupt. <em>Montgomery </em>has suggested an answer to this problem as well. \u201cA State may remedy a <em>Miller </em>violation by permitting juvenile homicide offenders to be considered for parole, rather than by resentencing them. See, <em>e.g., </em>Wyo. Stat. Ann. \u00a76-10-301(c) (2013) (juvenile homicide offenders eligible for parole after 25 years).\u201d Montgomery, _ U.S. at _, 136 S. Ct. at 736. In my view, the no parole designation in <em>Montgomery </em>was the sentencing aspect most troubling for the U.S. Supreme Court because parole ineligibility \u201ccondemned [the youthful offender] to die in prison.\u201d Montgomery, _ U.S. at _, 136 S. Ct. at 736. \u201cAllowing those offenders to be considered for parole ensures that juveniles whose crimes reflected only transient immaturity\u2014and who have since matured\u2014will not be forced to serve a disproportionate sentence in violation of the Eighth Amendment.\u201d Montgomery, _ U.S. at _, 136 S. Ct. at 736. The Court in <em>Montgomery </em>was suggesting a legislative solution for states with mandatory sentencing schemes, in light of its concern that \u201c[gjiving <em>Miller </em>retroactive effect ... not require States to relitigate sentences, let alone convictions, in every case where a juvenile offender received <em>mandatory </em>life without parole.\u201d <em>Montgomery, _ </em>U.S. at _, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>136 S. Ct. at 736 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">\u00b642 Based upon <em>Montgomery, </em>the suggested remedy to states with mandatory sentencing schemes of allowingfor parole, together with the prohibition of parole ineligibility in all but the rarest cases, I would conclude that any distinction between Steilman\u2019s sentence for a term of 110 years, without possibility of parole, and life imprisonment, without possibility of parole, is a distinction without a difference. Further, to conclude, as the Court does, that the availability of good time credit is a distinguishing aspect for purposes of sentencing a youth, is likewise inconsistent with the principles set forth in <em>Montgomery. </em>Opinion, \u00b6\u00b6 22-23. <em>Montgomery </em>never acknowledged the availability of good time credit as restoring \u201chope [to the offender] for some years of life outside prison walls <em>...\u2019\u2019Montgomery, _ </em>U.S. at _, 137 S. Ct. at 736, although doubtless the opportunity to accumulate good time credit was available to every offender whose sentence <em>Tatum </em>vacated. In a similar vein, this Court attempts to distinguish Steilman\u2019s sentence on the basis that it was imposed concurrently to his Washington sentence. Opinion, \u00b6\u00b6 22-23. However, imposing a concurrent sentence does nothing to reduce the length of Steilman\u2019s Montana sentence, which remains 110 years regardless of its concurrent nature. More important, however, is Steilman\u2019s parole ineligibility for 110 years, which was the most troublesome aspect for the U.S. Supreme Court in <em>Miller </em>and <em>Montgomery. </em>At the time the sentence was imposed, Steilman was left with no hope of time outside prison. Accordingly, to distinguish Steilman\u2019s sentence on either basis fails to recognize the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s direction that youth are constitutionally different from adults. A sentencer is required to consider \u201chow children are different, and how those differences counsel against <em>irrevocably </em>sentencing them to a lifetime in prison.\u201d Montgomery, _ U.S. at _, 136 S. Ct. at 733 (quoting Miller, 567 U.S. at 480, 132 S. Ct. at 2469) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b555-9\">\u00b643 Lastly, I would be remiss if I failed to comment on the hardship to a victim\u2019s family in having to revisit the tragic circumstances of a loved one\u2019s death. Principles of finality of judgments are deeply rooted in this country\u2019s jurisprudence and should be honored. Deference to the judgment of the sentencing judge, who is the judicial officer most attuned to the circumstances of the case, is equally well entrenched and should similarly be honored. I am, nonetheless, bound by U.S. Supreme Court precedent and obligated to apply it when the circumstances of the case dictate. Here, I can reach but one conclusion\u2014that <em>Montgomery </em>holds a sentence for a youth offender of 110 years without parole is unconstitutionally disproportionate when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>there is no finding supported by evidence that the youth is irreparably corrupted. The circumstances could support a conclusion that Steilman was irreparably corrupted when he committed the homicide. Steilman was six weeks shy of his eighteenth birthday, had committed another homicide in Washington, and was living an adult lifestyle. The murder was brutal, savage, and senseless. Thus, Steilman hardly appears entitled to \u201cMiller\u2019s central intuition\u2014that children who commit even heinous crimes are capable of change.\u201d Montgomery, _ U.S. at _, 136 S. Ct. at 736. That determination, however, must be made by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-7\">\u00b644 I would grant the petition for writ of habeas corpus on the basis that <em>Montgomery </em>and <em>Miller </em>established a new substantive rule that is applicable in state collateral proceedings. In contrast to Justices Wheat and Sandefur, however, I would remand for resentencing so that the District Court is free to impose the original sentence, provided the <em>Miller </em>and <em>Montgomery </em>requirements are met. I do not agree that this Court should merely strike Steilman\u2019s parole restriction as suggested by the <em>Montgomery </em>Court; particular circumstances of a case and the reasons for imposing a sentence should be considered and determined by the trial court, with this Court subsequently reviewing those decisions and record. Based on statements from the victim\u2019s family and other documents in the record, it is clear that parole ineligibility was a significant factor in Steilman\u2019s sentence. It may be, however, that the victim\u2019s family, following discussion with the prosecutor, would prefer to ask the District Court to reimpose his original sentence, none of which we can assess by merely striking the parole restriction. Accordingly, I would remand these proceedings to the District Court for resentencing consistent with <em>Miller </em>and <em>Montgomery.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b556-8\">\u00b645 While I agree with much of the analysis set forth by the Court in Issue One, it is my belief that the Court fails to adequately recognize the impact of <em>Montgomery </em>and the findings and conclusions which must be made by the sentencing court. I dissent from the Court\u2019s decision in Issue Two, that a term of 110 years without parole is different from a sentence of life imprisonment without parole. Such a conclusion ignores the primary concern in Montgomery\u2014that a youth offender not be \u201ccondemned to die in prison\u201d without an \u201copportunity to show [his or her] crime did not reflect irreparable corruption; and, if it did not, [his or her] hope for some years of life outside prison walls must be restored.\u201d Montgomery, _ U.S. at _, 137 S. Ct. at 736-37.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-10\">\u00b646 I dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
