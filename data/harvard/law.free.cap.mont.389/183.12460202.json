The merits of CI-116 and the policy choices behind it are not at issue in this case. The only question before this Court is whether the procedure by which CI-116 was submitted to voters conformed to Montana\u2019s constitutional requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-7\">\u00b62 This Court has original jurisdiction over declaratory judgment actions \u201cwhen urgency or emergency factors exist making litigation in the trial courts and the normal appeal process inadequate and when the case involves purely legal questions of statutory or constitutional interpretation which are of state-wide importance.\u201d M. R. App. P. 14(4). <em>See also </em>Mont. Const. art. VII, \u00a7 2(1)-(2); \u00a7\u00a7 3-2-201 and -202(1), MCA. In this case, normal litigation and appeal processes are inadequate because implementation of CI-116 is imminent. Furthermore, the question of whether CI-116 violates the Montana Constitution involves purely legal questions of constitutional interpretation because analysis of Montana Constitution, Article XIV, Section ll\u2019s separate-vote requirement focuses on the manner in which a constitutional amendment is submitted to the voters at an election. What is in issue and what this Court must adjudge is not directed by a factual record or inquiry, but rather is directed to the legality of the enactment or adoption process itself. Indeed, it is precisely because we are addressing only the enactment process and whether that process survives constitutional scrutiny that a factual record evidencing a dispute or conflict surrounding the numerous provisions of CI-116 is unnecessary. Thus, this case is properly before the Court as an original proceeding and we accordingly accept jurisdiction. <em>See Marshall v. State, </em>1999 MT 33, \u00b6 5, 293 Mont. 274, 975 P.2d 325.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-8\">\u00b63 We conclude that the single-subject requirement, set forth in Article V, Section 11(3), of the Montana Constitution, applies to bills of the Legislature and not to constitutional amendments. We further conclude that CI-116 violates the separate-vote requirement, set forth in Article XIV, Section 11, of Montana\u2019s Constitution, and is therefore void in its entirety.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-9\">\u00b64 We restate the dispositive issue as whether CI-116 violates the separate-vote requirement contained in Montana Constitution, Article XIV, Section 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">\u00b65 On November 8,2016, a majority of Montana voters approved CI-116, a constitutional amendment proposed by popular initiative. As enacted, CI-116 amended Article II of Montana\u2019s Constitution by adding a new Section 36, titled Rights of Crime Victims.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> By way of description, CI-116 contains four sections. CI-116(1) enumerates eighteen rights to which crime victims are entitled. These rights are meant \u201c[t]o preserve and protect a crime victim\u2019s right to justice, to ensure a crime victim has a meaningful role in criminal and juvenile justice systems, and to ensure that a crime victim\u2019s rights and interests are respected and protected by law in a manner no less vigorous than the protections afforded to a criminal defendant and a delinquent youth.\u201d Among some of the rights afforded to victims by CI-116 are the right \u201cto due process,\u201d CI-116(1)(a); the right \u201cto privacy, including the right to refuse an interview, deposition, or other discovery request and to set reasonable conditions on the conduct of any interaction to which the victim consents,\u201d CI-116(1)(f); the right to \u201cnotice of\u2019 and to be \u201cpresent at all proceedings involving the criminal conduct, plea, sentencing, adjudication, disposition, release, or escape of the defendant or youth ... and any proceeding implicating the rights of the victim,\u201d CI-116(1)(g); the right to be \u201cheard in any proceeding involving the release, plea, sentencing, disposition, adjudication, or parole of the defendant or youth,\u201d CI-116(1)(i); the right to \u201cproceedings free from unreasonable delay and to a prompt and final conclusion of the case and any related postjudgment proceedings,\u201d CI-116(1)(o); and the right to be informed of the enumerated rights and advised that \u201cthe victim may seek the advice and assistance of an attorney with respect to\u201d those rights, CI-116(1)(r).</p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">\u00b66 CI-116(2) provides the manner in which victim\u2019s rights are to be recognized and effectuated. A victim, the victim\u2019s attorney or representative, or the prosecuting attorney \u201cmay assert and seek enforcement of the rights enumerated\u201d in any \u201ctrial or appellate court or any other authority with jurisdiction over the case as a matter of right.\u201d The court \u201cshall act promptly on the request, affording a remedy by due course of law for the violation of any right. The reasons for any decision regarding disposition of a victim\u2019s right must be clearly stated on the record.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b213-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>\u00b67 CI-116(3) ensures that the enumerated rights \u201cmay not be construed to deny or disparage\u201d other victims\u2019 rights and provides that CI-116 \u201capplies to criminal and youth court proceedings, is self-executing, and requires no further action by the Legislature.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">\u00b68 CI-116(4) provides definitions for \u201ccrime\u201d and \u201cvictim.\u201d A \u201ccrime\u201d to which a victim\u2019s enumerated rights apply includes felonies, misdemeanors, and delinquency proceedings. The definition of \u201cvictim,\u201d CI-116(4)(b), includes the victim, who has suffered direct or threatened harm, and his or her \u201cspouse, parent, grandparent, child, sibling, grandchild, or guardian.\u201d Victim also includes someone with a \u201crelationship to the victim that is substantially similar\u201d to the relationship of a spouse, parent, grandparent, child, sibling, grandchild, or guardian. Finally, \u201cvictim\u201d does not include the accused or someone the \u201ccourt believes would not act in the best interests of a minor or of a victim who is deceased, incompetent, or incarcerated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AeP\">\u00b69 CI-116 was to become effective July 1, 2017. <em>Mont. Cnty. Attorneys Ass\u2019n v. State, </em>No. OP 16-0720, 387 Mont. 534, 391 P.3d 734 (table) (Jan. 3, 2017). However, on June 20, 2017, the Petitioners, Montana Association of Counties, Leo Gallagher, Adrian M. Miller, Montana Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, and ACLU of Montana Foundation, Inc. (together, MACo), filed an original petition for declaratory judgment and injunctive relief. We ordered a response from the State of Montana (State) and additional briefing from the parties. On June 30, 2017, we stayed implementation of CI-116 to allow thorough consideration of the parties\u2019 arguments, relevant case law, and the applicable provisions of Montana\u2019s Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">\u00b610 MACo, supported by amici,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> requests this Court declare void the enactment of CI-116, enjoin CI-116\u2019s implementation and enforcement, and decertify the election results with respect to CI-116. MACo argues CI-116 violates two provisions of the Montana Constitution: the single-subject requirement of Article V, Section 11(3), and the separate-vote requirement of Article XIV, Section 11. MACo reasons CI-116 violates the single-subject requirement because involving a victim\u2019s kin in criminal justice decisions is a subject separate from providing rights to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>traditional victims.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Regarding the separate-vote requirement, MACo argues the \u201cextensive language\u201d of CI-116 amends at least eight sections of Montana\u2019s Constitution and, thus, a vote was needed to amend each section individually.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">\u00b611 The State, also supported by amici,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> responds that the single-subject requirement does not apply to constitutional initiatives. Alternatively, the State maintains that crime victims\u2019 rights is CI-116\u2019s only subject. The State also contends CI-116 does not violate the separate-vote requirement because the initiative does not \u201cchange or formally alter\u201d any preexisting constitutional provision. The State further urges this Court to not follow the \u201camendment-by-implication\u201d theory advanced by MACo, but, in any event, maintains that CI-116 does not impliedly amend other parts of the Constitution. Finally, the State contends that construing the separate-vote requirement as MACo requests would essentially abolish the constitutional initiative process in Montana.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b214-7\">\u00b612 Montana\u2019s Constitution may be amended in three ways, all of which are set forth in Article XIV: (1) by constitutional convention, Mont. Const. art. XIV, \u00a7\u00a7 1-7; (2) by legislative referendum, Mont. Const. art. XIV, \u00a7 8; and (3) by popular initiative, Mont. Const, art. XIV, \u00a7 9. Here we are only concerned with amendment by popular initiative. The people of this State have the \u201cexclusive right of governing themselves as a free, sovereign, and independent state\u201d and \u201cmay alter or abolish the constitution and form of government whenever they deem necessary.\u201d Mont. Const. art. II, \u00a7 2. Where the people, in adopting a constitution, have prescribed the method by which it may be revised or amended, any attempt to amend the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>fundamental law in violation of a self-imposed restriction is unconstitutional. Accordingly, as long as Montana\u2019s Constitution is in effect, \u201cthe people may amend the constitution by initiative only in the manner provided by the constitution.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Mont. Citizens for Pres. of Citizen\u2019s Rights v. Waltermire, </em>227 Mont. 85, 90-91, 738 P.2d 1255, 1258 (1987). The constitutional limitations on the initiative process are important because \u201c[t]he sovereignty of the people is itself subject to those constitutional limitations which have been duly adopted and remain unrepealed.\u201d <em>Waltermire, </em>227 Mont. at 91, 738 P.2d at 1258 <em>(quoting Hunter v. Erickson, </em>393 U.S. 385, 392, 89 S. Ct. 557, 561 (1969)).</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">\u00b613 Montana\u2019s 1972 Constitution provided citizens with a new way to amend their Constitution: by popular initiative. <em>Compare </em>Mont. Const. of 1889, art XIX, \u00a7 9 <em>with </em>Mont. Const. art. XIV, \u00a7\u00a7 1-11. The addition was consistent with the overall theme of the 1972 Constitutional Convention of constructing a flexible Constitution subject to popular control. Anthony Johnstone, <em>The Constitutional Initiative in Montana, </em>71 Mont. L. Rev. 325, 341 (2010). The Constitutional Convention Delegates (Delegates) focused on creating a Constitution that would reflect the notions of popular sovereignty and self-government embodied in Article II. Johnstone, <em>supra, </em>at 340, 342. The Constitutional Revision Committee (Committee) proposed the initiative power because it believed the power was \u201can inherent right in a body politic whose Constitution is to be the embodiment of the will of the people.\u201d Montana Constitutional Convention, Committee Proposals, February 12, 1972, p. 363 (hereinafter Committee Proposal). The Committee wanted to ensure the 1972 Constitution provided a constitutional revision process that \u201chit a happy and workable medium.\u201d Committee Proposal, p. 364.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">\u00b614 Consequently, while providing for initiative power, the 1972 Constitution also imposed limitations on the initiative process. Such limitations included signature gathering and geographic distribution requirements. Mont. Const. art. XIV, \u00a7 9(1). The Committee determined limitations were necessary because it was \u201cnot unreasonable to demand strict standards when dealing with something as fundamental and important as Constitutional change.\u201d Committee Proposal, p. 363. The Committee noted another check on the constitutional amendment process: the separate-vote requirement. Committee Proposal, p. 363. Indeed, the official voter pamphlet for the new Constitution explained to voters that the only limit on how constitutional amendments may be submitted at an election was the requirement that each amendment \u201cbe clearly designated on the ballot <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>so that they can be voted on separately.\u201d Concerned Citizens for Constitutional Improvement, <em>The Proposed 1972 Constitution for the State of Montana, </em>Montana Newspapers, 1972, at 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">\u00b615 The separate-vote requirement is one of eleven sections in Article XIV directing the manner in which Montana\u2019s Constitution may be revised. In particular, the separate-vote requirement pertains to submission of a proposed amendment, providing that if more than one constitutional amendment is presented to voters during the same election, voters must have the option to vote on each amendment separately:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-6\">Submission. If more than one amendment is submitted at the same election, each shall be so prepared and distinguished that it can be voted upon separately.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b216-7\">Mont. Const. art. XIV, \u00a7 11.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The separate-vote requirement was \u201cdesigned to aid voters in casting their votes on Constitutional issues, and as a check on the possible action of grouping several issues under one innocuous title.\u201d Committee Proposal, p. 363. The separate-vote requirement has a long history in Montana. Montana\u2019s 1884<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and 1889<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Constitutions both contained a separate-vote requirement, and the requirement was adopted unanimously during the Constitutional Convention of 1972. Montana Constitutional Convention, Verbatim Transcript, March 1, 1972, pp. 1195-96. The separate-vote requirement has two well-recognized objectives. The first is to avoid voter confusion and deceit of the public by ensuring proposals are not misleading or the effects of which are concealed or not readily understandable. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>second is to avoid \u201clogrolling\u201d or combining unrelated amendments into a single measure which might not otherwise command majority support. By combining unrelated amendments, approval of the measure may be secured by different groups, each of which will support the entire proposal in order to secure some part, even though not approving all parts of a multifarious amendment. <em>Fugina v. Donovan, </em>104 N.W.2d 911, 914 (Minn. 1960). <em>See also In re Initiative Petition No. 314, </em>625 P.2d 595 (Okla. 1980); <em>Kerby v. Luhrs, </em>36 P.2d 549 (Ariz. 1934).</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">\u00b616 This Court\u2019s interpretation of the separate-vote requirement has narrowed over time as the processes by which the Constitution can be amended have changed. In the early twentieth century, before Montana\u2019s Constitution could be amended by initiative, we held the separate-vote requirement satisfied as long as all provisions of the proposed constitutional amendment related to one subject matter or a single plan. <em>See, e.g., State ex rel. Corry v. Cooney, </em>70 Mont. 355, 365, 255 P. 1007, 1011 (1924) (concluding the separate-vote requirement satisfied if \u201cthe operation of the amendment relates to a single plan or purpose\u201d); <em>State ex rel. Hay v. Alderson, </em>49 Mont. 387, 404, 142 P. 210, 213 (1914) (holding the separate-vote requirement satisfied as long as all parts of the proposed constitutional amendment \u201cmay be logically viewed as parts or aspects of a single plan\u201d); <em>State ex rel. Teague v. Bd. of Comm\u2019rs, </em>34 Mont. 426, 430, 87 P. 450, 451 (1906) (holding a proposed amendment constitutional under the separate-vote requirement because it was not \u201cthree separate propositions\u201d but instead was \u201conly one matter and one subject\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">\u00b617 We revisited our <em>Cooney, Hay, </em>and <em>Teague </em>separate-vote reasoning and jurisprudence following ratification of the 1972 Constitution and introduction of the petition by popular initiative. Notably, our 1999 decision in <em>Marshall v. State </em>overruled <em>Cooney, Hay, </em>and <em>Teague </em>to the extent those decisions failed to recognize a distinction between the single-subject and separate-vote requirements. <em>Marshall, </em>\u00b6 23. In <em>Marshall </em>we explained that a proposed amendment could relate to a single plan or purpose, but still violate the separate-vote requirement because it contained more than one amendment to Montana\u2019s Constitution. <em>Marshall, </em>\u00b6 22. Central to our decision in <em>Marshall </em>was the fact that <em>Cooney, Hay, </em>and <em>Teague </em>were decided when constitutional amendments could only be proposed by the Legislature\u2014before Montana\u2019s Constitution could be amended by initiative. <em>Marshall, </em>\u00b6 19. We found this distinction remarkable because when a constitutional amendment is proposed by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>Legislature through referendum, representatives debate and deliberate the proposition. <em>Marshall, </em>\u00b6 19. On the other hand, when a constitutional amendment is proposed by initiative, Montana voters do not have the same opportunity to consider and debate the proposition. <em>Marshall, </em>\u00b6 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">\u00b618 Based on these observations, we noted that the separate-vote requirement \u201cis a cogent constitutional recognition of the circumstances under which Montana voters receive constitutional initiatives.\u201d <em>Marshall, </em>\u00b6 19. Voters do not have the opportunity to consider, discuss, and potentially change constitutional amendments proposed by initiative in the same way the Legislature does those proposed by referendum. Therefore, the separate-vote requirement serves as an important check on the initiative process, confirming the integrity of the vote and ensuring the voters actually approve of a particular amendment. Our interpretation of the separate-vote requirement in <em>Marshall </em>ensured Montana voters always have the option to independently select or reject each constitutional amendment, guaranteeing the people have complete control over Montana\u2019s fundamental law. <em>Marshall, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 19, 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">\u00b619 Prior to <em>Marshall </em>and adoption of our 1972 Constitution, this Court analyzed the separate-vote provision based on whether a proposed constitutional amendment contained one subject or matter. The 1972 Constitution\u2019s amendment by initiative interjected a new element into the separate-vote requirement, leading to some confusion regarding the difference between the separate-vote and single-subject requirements. While we distinguished the separate-vote and single-subject requirements in <em>Marshall, </em>holding each provision is substantively different, we implied that both provisions apply to constitutional amendments proposed by initiative. <em>Marshall, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 18, 22. We decided the test for the separate-vote requirement is stricter than that of the single-subject requirement. <em>Marshall, </em>\u00b6 22. We noted that reading the separate-vote requirement narrower than the single-subject requirement made sense \u201cbecause the act of amending the constitution is significantly different from enacting or enabling legislation.\u201d <em>Marshall, </em>\u00b6 22. We explained in <em>Marshall </em>that a proposed constitutional amendment could satisfy the single-subject requirement but be invalid under the separate-vote requirement. <em>Marshall, </em>\u00b6 22. Because the Court found CI-75 unconstitutional pursuant to the separate-vote requirement of Article XIV, Section 11, a narrower requirement than the single-subject requirement, we never addressed the applicability of Article V, Section ll(3)\u2019s single-subject <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">\u00b620 We now directly consider whether the single-subject requirement applies to constitutional amendments proposed by initiative and decide that it does not. The Montana Constitution contains both a single-subject requirement for bills proposed by the Legislature, Article V, Section 11(3), and a separate-vote requirement for constitutional amendments, Article XIV, Section 11. The single-subject requirement provides the guidelines by which the Legislature must present bills to the electorate:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-6\">Each bill, except general appropriation bills and bills for the codification and general revision of the laws, shall contain only one subject, clearly expressed in its title. If any subject is embraced in any act and is not expressed in the title, only so much of the act not so expressed is void.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b219-7\">Mont. Const. art. V, \u00a7 11(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b219-8\">\u00b621 Montana\u2019s single-subject requirement necessitates that bills developed by the Legislature contain only one subject. In contrast, constitutional amendments developed via initiative never go through the Legislature. Therefore, the Legislature has no control over a constitutional amendment proposed by initiative. It follows that Article V, governing the way in which the Legislature prepares and proposes bills, does not also govern constitutional amendments raised by initiative, a power lying exclusively with the people and provided for in Article XIV.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-9\">\u00b622 The Oregon Supreme Court\u2019s decision <em>Armatta v. Kitzhaber, </em>959 P.2d 49 (Or. 1998), guided our <em>Marshall </em>decision. <em>Marshall, </em>\u00b6 22. However, the Montana Constitution differs from Oregon\u2019s Constitution. Oregon\u2019s Constitution has a single-subject requirement that applies directly to constitutional initiatives. Or. Const. art. IV, \u00a7 (1)(2)(d) (\u201cA proposed law or amendment to the Constitution shall embrace one subject only and matters properly connected therewith.\u201d). Conversely, and significant to our analysis here, Montana\u2019s Constitution, Article XIV, guiding constitutional revision, does <em>not </em>have a single-subject requirement. Montana\u2019s single-subject requirement relied on by MACo is contained in Article V, which pertains to the Legislature. To the extent our holding here conflicts with our analysis of the single-subject requirement in <em>Marshall, </em>we clarify that the single-subject requirement contained in Article V, Section 11(3), of the Montana Constitution does not apply to constitutional amendments. Nonetheless, the distinction made in <em>Marshall </em>between the separate-vote and single-subject requirements, the reasoning in support thereof, and our reliance on <em>Armatta\u2019s </em>separate-vote analysis were well-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>reasoned and remain valid. Because we hold that the single-subject requirement does not apply to constitutional amendments, we do not address MACo\u2019s contention that CI-116 violates Montana Constitution, Article V, Section 11(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">\u00b623 While <em>Marshall </em>is significant for its explanation of the separate-vote requirement in the context of an amendment by initiative, particularly in distinguishing the separate-vote requirement from the less arduous single-subject requirement, the Court invalidated CI-75 based on the express language of the initiative itself, which specifically amended other provisions of the Constitution. <em>Marshall, </em>\u00b6 24. We determined these express amendments each needed a separate vote pursuant to Article XIV, Section 11. <em>Marshall, </em>\u00b6 24. While explaining that CI-75 also affected other parts of the Constitution by limiting legislative spending, we did not incorporate these implied amendments into our reasoning because our discussion of the three express changes was sufficient to demonstrate CI-75\u2019s violation of the separate-vote requirement. <em>See Marshall, </em>\u00b6 24 n.2. In deciding <em>Marshall </em>in this manner, we left unanswered what <em>is </em>a \u201cseparate amendment\u201d for purposes of the separate-vote requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">\u00b624 Before turning to that question, however, we are compelled to address the State\u2019s assertion that we completely rejected the amendment-by-implication theory in <em>Marshall. </em>Deciding <em>Marshall </em>on alternative grounds, without addressing amendment-by-implication, does not mean we rejected such an analysis. In fact, we left open the possibility in <em>Marshall </em>of expanding upon our separate-vote analysis should the need arise, as it has here. <em>Marshall, </em>\u00b6 24 n.2. More importantly, we conclude our reasoning would be fundamentally flawed if we limited the separate-vote requirement to only those multifarious amendments which expressly refer to other constitutional provisions. Such an interpretation would allow the separate-vote requirement to be easily undermined by simple drafting techniques. In the context of constitutional amendments by initiative, voters act as legislators. It is this Court\u2019s obligation to ensure that interest groups and individuals advocating for passage or defeat of a measure do not undermine the right of the voters to decide upon each constitutional change separately, either as a result of expressly incorporating more than one change or doing so by implication. We endeavor now to answer the question left open in Marshall; that is, how to determine whether an amendment by initiative contains two or more separate amendments in violation of Montana Constitution, Article XIV, Section 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-7\">\u00b625 It is our task to interpret the Constitution by giving \u201ceffect to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>intent of the people adopting it.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Hinz v. Moody, </em>71 Mont. 473, 481, 230 P. 575, 578 (1924). This intent \u201cis to be found in the instrument itself\u2019 by looking at \u201cthe natural signification of the words employed.\u201d <em>Moody, </em>71 Mont. at 481-82, 230 P. at 578-79. The separate-vote requirement states, \u201cIf more than one amendment is submitted at the same election, each shall be so prepared and distinguished that it can be voted upon separately.\u201d Mont. Const. art. XIV, \u00a7 11. The clear import of this provision is that voters must be allowed to express their separate opinion as to each proposed constitutional amendment. Accordingly, this Court is obligated to ensure that voters have the opportunity to cast separate votes for separate amendments. At the same time, we must apply the separate-vote requirement in a manner that does not encumber the right of the people to amend the Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">\u00b626 There is considerable variance in the way other state courts interpret their separate-vote requirements. <em>See Cambria v. Soaries, </em>776 A.2d 754, 762-65 (N.J. 2000). At one end of the spectrum are states that make only a slight distinction between the broader single-subject requirement and the separate-vote requirement, requiring the parts be rationally or logically related to each other. <em>See Fugina, </em>104 N.W.2d at 915. Other states have adopted a more narrow interpretation, but are still deferential to the single-subject analysis and do not make a measurable distinction between single-subject and separate-vote requirements. <em>See, e.g., Missourians to Protect the Initiative Process v. Blunt, </em>799 S.W.2d 824, 830-31 (Mo. <em>1990); Milwaukee Alliance Against Racist and Political Repression v. Elections Bd. </em>of Wis, 317 N.W.2d 420, 425 (Wis. 1982); <em>Carter v. Burson, </em>198 S.E.2d 151, 156 (Ga. 1973); <em>Ohio ex rel. Roahrig v. Brown, </em>282 N.E.2d 584, 586 (Ohio 1972). The narrowest interpretation of the separate-vote requirement clearly distinguishes it from the single-subject requirement by requiring there be a single subject to the proposed amendment and parts so interdependent that they constitute a whole and cannot be separated. <em>See Kerby, </em>36 P.2d at 554 (\u201c[T]he different changes contained in the proposed amendment [did not] cover matters necessary to be dealt with in some manner, in order that the Constitution, as amended, shall constitute a consistent and workable whole on the general topic embraced in that part which is amended, and if, logically speaking, they should stand or fall as a whole, then there is but one amendment submitted.\u201d). See <em>also Lee v. Utah, </em>367 P.2d 861, 864 (Utah 1962); <em>Farris v. Munro, </em>662 P.2d 821, 825 (Wash. 1983); <em>Armatta, </em>959 P.2d at 63.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>\u00b627 In <em>Armatta, </em>which this Court relied upon in <em>Marshall, </em>the Oregon Supreme Court concluded the proper inquiry was \u201cwhether, if adopted, the proposal would make two or more changes to the constitution that are substantive and that are not closely related.\u201d <em>Armatta, </em>959 P.2d at 64. If the \u201cproposal would effect two or more changes that are substantive and not closely related, the proposal violates the separate-vote requirement ... because it would prevent the voters from expressing their opinions as to each proposed change separately.\u201d <em>Armatta, </em>959 P.2d at 64. \u201cIn some instances, it will be clear from the text of the proposed initiative whether it runs afoul of [the separate-vote requirement]. In other instances, it will be necessary to examine the implications of the proposal before determining whether it contains two or more amendments.\u201d <em>Armatta, </em>959 P.2d at 64.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">\u00b628 We conclude that the proper inquiry is whether, if adopted, the proposal would make two or more changes to the Constitution that are substantive and not closely related. This conclusion is based upon the language of Article XIV, Section 11; our decision in <em>Marshall </em>distinguishing between the single-subject and separate-vote requirements in the context of constitutional amendment by initiative; our conclusion that the single-subject requirement contained in Article V, Section 11(3), is inapplicable to constitutional amendments; and the transcripts of the 1972 Constitutional Convention. Furthermore, if a proposed constitutional amendment adds new matter to the Constitution, that proposition is at least one change in and of itself. <em>See, e.g., Oregon v. Rogers, </em>288 P.3d 544, 547 (Or. 2012) <em>(citing Lehman v. Bradbury, </em>37 P.3d 989, 996 (Or. 2002)). Then, \u201cif a measure has the effect of modifying an existing constitutional provision, it proposes at least one additional change to the constitution, whether that effect is express or <em>implicit.\u201d Rogers, </em>288 P.3d at 548 <em>(citing Meyer v. Bradbury, </em>142 P.3d 1031, 1036 (Or. 2006)).</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">\u00b629 Our separate-vote inquiry begins by focusing on the changes CI-116 makes to the Montana Constitution. We employ well-understood legal meanings in considering whether changes are substantive: \u201c[a]n essential part of constituent or relating to what is essential.\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>1429 (Henry C. Black ed., 6th ed. 1990). Additionally, numerous factors may be considered in determining whether the provisions of a proposed constitutional amendment are \u201cclosely related.\u201d These factors may include:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-7\">[WJhether various provisions are facially related, whether all the matters addressed by [the proposition] concern a single section of the constitution, whether the voters or the legislature historically <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>has treated the matters addressed as one subject, and whether the various provisions are qualitatively similar in their effect on either procedural or substantive law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b223-5\"><em>McLaughlin v. Bennett, </em>238 P.3d 619, 622 (Ariz. 2010) (quoting <em>Ariz. Together v. Brewer, </em>149 P.3d 742, 746 (Ariz. 2007)). The Oregon Supreme Court explained <em>Armatta\u2019s </em>\u201cclosely related\u201d prong:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-6\">First, we examine the relationship among the constitutional provisions that the measure affects, both explicitly and implicitly. If the affected provisions of the existing constitution themselves are not related, then it is likely that changes to those provisions will offend the separate-vote requirement. That conclusion makes sense, because it is difficult to make related changes to unrelated constitutional provisions. However, we decline to speculate whether the fact that a proposed amendment affects unrelated provisions of the constitution will be fatal in every case, because, in doing so, we might underestimate the ability of initiative petitioners to design careful, constitutionally sound amendments for the voters to consider. Nonetheless, the fact that a proposed amendment asks the people, in one vote, substantively to change multiple provisions of the Oregon Constitution that are not themselves related is one indication that the proposed amendment might violate the separate-vote requirement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-7\">Next, we must consider the constitutional changes themselves. That is, assuming that the constitutional provisions affected by the measure are related, we must determine whether the changes made to those related constitutional provisions are closely related. If they are closely related, the measure under consideration survives scrutiny under [the separate-vote requirement]. If they are not, it does not.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b223-8\"><em>Lehman, </em>37 P.3d at 998 (emphasis in original; footnote omitted). <em>See also League of Or. Cities v. Oregon, </em>56 P.3d 892, 910 (Or. 2002) (applying the same closely-related analysis to a proposed constitutional amendment).</p>\n<p id=\"b223-9\">\u00b630 Consideration of whether the proposed constitutional changes are closely related gives appropriate effect to the separate-vote requirement by ensuring each constitutional amendment receives its own vote without unduly restricting constitutional change. Other states have applied similar closely-related analyses to proposed constitutional amendments and upheld the amendments as constitutional, demonstrating that a properly constructed constitutional amendment could certainly be found constitutional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>pursuant to our reasoning today. <em>See, e.g., Rogers, </em>288 P.3d at 552-53 (applying <em>Armatta\u2019s </em>separate-vote analysis to and upholding a proposed amendment to Oregon\u2019s Constitution imposing the death penalty because the changes to multiple areas of the constitution were closely related); <em>Cambria, </em>776 A.2d at 765 (applying <em>Armatta\u2019s </em>separate-vote analysis to and upholding a proposed amendment to New Jersey\u2019s Constitution dedicating revenue streams because the amendment \u201cconstitu[ted] a reasonably integrated whole in which the parts are closely related to one another\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">\u00b631 We turn now to the text of CI-116 to determine whether its submission to Montana voters violated the separate-vote requirement. CI-116 expressly amends Article II of the Montana Constitution by adding a new Section 36, providing for specific crime victim rights. Adding a new constitutional provision constitutes one change. CI-116 does not expressly mention, repeal, or otherwise modify any other areas of the Constitution. However, CI-116 implicitly substantively changes multiple provisions of Montana\u2019s Constitution, some of which we now discuss.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">A. <em>CI-116(1)(a) Provides a New Due Process Right for Crime Victims.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b224-7\">\u00b632 Article II, Section 17, of Montana\u2019s Constitution provides an individual the right of due process:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-8\">No person shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process of law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b224-9\">Mont. Const. art. II, \u00a7 17. CI-116 supplements this preexisting provision with another due process right\u2014one exclusive to crime victims.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-10\">\u00b633 The first right CI-116 provides to a crime victim is the right \u201cto due process and to be treated with fairness and respect for the victim\u2019s dignity.\u201d CI-116(1)(a). Accordingly, subsection (1)(a) of CI-116, standing on its own, creates a new due process guarantee for, specifically, crime victims. This new due process right for crime victims is a change in itself because, unlike our existing due process clause, it identifies a particular group of persons entitled to due process protections. Identifying and defining a group of persons who are entitled to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>expressly enumerated due process protections may also implicitly change other areas of the Constitution by effectuating a substantive change which is <em>not closely related </em>to a victim\u2019s due process right, thus violating the separate-vote requirement. Although it is difficult to imagine that a proposed provision granting a due process guarantee to crime victims would not be closely related to Montana\u2019s existing grant to persons of a due process guarantee as contained in Montana Constitution, Article II, we decline to speculate on whether submission of only CI-116(1)(a) would violate the separate-vote requirement. By way of illustration, the definition in CI-116 of \u201ccrime\u201d and \u201cvictim,\u201d appears broader through its inclusion of various individuals and types of proceedings than that ascribed to \u201cperson\u201d as embodied in our existing constitutional provision. Nonetheless, for purposes of our decision today, it is clear that CI-116 as a whole enumerates many other crime victim rights that are not closely related to our existing due process guarantee contained in Article II, Section 17. Consequently, it is unnecessary to determine whether CI-116(1)(a) is closely related to Article II, Section 17, as CI-116(1)(a) undisputedly adds matter to an existing constitutional provision and constitutes one change in itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">\n<em>B.

For example, the Rules prohibit a prosecutor from \u201cprosecuting a charge that the prosecutor knows is not supported by probable cause.\u201d M. R. Pro. Cond. 3.8(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b225-9\">\u00b635 The purpose of CI-116 is to provide rights to victims \u201c[t]o preserve and protect a crime victim\u2019s right to justice, to ensure a crime victim has a meaningful role in criminal and juvenile justice systems, and to ensure that a crime victim\u2019s rights and interests are respected and protected by aw in a manner <em>no less vigorous than the protections afforded toa criminal defendant and a delinquent youth\u201d </em>CI-116(1) (emphasis added). One of the ways CI-116 effectuates those purposes is by giving a victim the right to \u201cconfer with the prosecuting attorney.\u201d CI-116(1)(j). CI-116 also provides that \u201cthe prosecuting attorney at the request of the victim may assert and seek enforcement of the [victim\u2019s] rights ....\u201d CI-116(2).</p>\n<p id=\"AxF\">\u00b636  CI-116 changes a prosecutor\u2019s duties in a criminal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>adjudication. CI-116 requires prosecutors to confer with a victim for the purposes of preserving and protecting the victim\u2019s right to justice, ensuring the victim has a meaningful role in the justice system, and ensuring the victim\u2019s rights and interests are respected and protected in a manner as vigorous as the protections afforded to a criminal defendant. CI-116 also gives prosecutors the option to, at the victim\u2019s request, seek enforcement of the victim\u2019s rights. CI-116 changes the way a prosecutor must handle a criminal case in which there is a victim, thus affecting the Supreme Court\u2019s power under Article VII, Section 2(3), to make rules governing attorney conduct. We conclude Montana Constitution Article VII, Section 2(3), is substantively changed by CI-116(1)(j) and (2), and that the provisions relating to crime victims\u2019 rights are not closely related to this Court\u2019s constitutional authority to regulate attorney conduct. Accordingly, asking the people in one vote to substantively change multiple provisions of the Constitution which are not closely related violated the separate-vote requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">\n<em>C.

Thus, CI-116 changes an accused\u2019s right to bail provided in Montana Constitution Article II, Section 21, by constitutionally prohibiting a court from releasing a defendant or youth on bail until all victims, including kinship and those having a \u201csubstantially similar relationship\u201d to the victim, are present and heard by the court. CI-116 constitutionally requires a court not release a defendant until the victim appears and is heard, substantively affecting Article II, Section 21\u2019s requirement of bail upon sufficient surety. We conclude Montana Constitution Article II, Section 21, is substantively changed by CI-116(1)(g) and (i), because CI-116(1)(g) and (i) add new constitutional requirements to the preexisting bail provision. The constitutional provision regarding an accused\u2019s right to bail is not closely related to victims\u2019 rights and the separate-vote requirement was violated when voters were asked to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>consider these multiple amendments in one measure.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">\n<em>D.

The initiative further grants victims the right \u201cto be heard in any proceeding involving the release, plea, sentencing, disposition, adjudication, or parole of the defendant or youth accused of delinquency and any proceeding implicating the rights of the victim.\u201d CI-116(1)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"AGY\">\u00b641  CI-116 thus requires courts give the victim notice of, allow the victim to be present at, and give the victim the opportunity to be heard at various hearings. These rights given to the victim add steps to the procedures a court is constitutionally required to take under Article II, Section 20, in initiating proceedings against a defendant and drawing a grand jury. We conclude Article II, Section 20, of Montana\u2019s Constitution is substantively changed by CI-116(1)(g) and (i) and that the preexisting constitutional provision related to initiation of criminal proceedings is not closely related to crime victims\u2019 rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-12\">\n<em>E.

Const. art II, \u00a7 10. The public\u2019s right to know, Article II, Section 9, is balanced against the individual\u2019s right of privacy, Article II, Section 10. Montana Constitutional Convention, Committee Proposals, February 23, 1972, p. 631. Consistent with this interpretation by the Delegates, we have likewise found the two constitutional provisions are evaluated using a carefully designed, fact-intensive, balancing test. <em>See, e.g., Billings Gazette v. Billings, </em>2013 MT 334, \u00b6\u00b6 14-16, 372 Mont. 409, 313 P.3d 129; <em>Missoula Cnty. Pub. Sch. v. Bitterroot Star, </em>2015 MT 95, \u00b6 11, 378 Mont. 451, 345 P.3d 1035. The right of privacy is an individual right and therefore cannot be invoked by all legally defined \u201cpersons,\u201d such as corporations or other groups. Montana Constitutional Convention, Verbatim Transcript, March 7, 1972, p. 1680; <em>Great Falls Tribune v. Mont. PSC, </em>2003 MT 359, \u00b6 33, 319 Mont. 38, 82 P.3d 876. Thus, the right to know, Article II, Section 9, is limited only by a natural person\u2019s right of privacy, and may not be limited by the privacy interests of corporations or groups. <em>Great Falls Tribune, </em>\u00b6 37.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">\u00b647 CI-116(1)(f) provides a crime victim with the right \u201cto privacy, including the right to refuse an interview, deposition, or other discovery request and to set reasonable conditions on the conduct of any interaction to which the victim consents.\u201d Thus, CI-116 creates an entirely new privacy interest for victims, extended family members, and others with \u201csimilar relationships.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Ady\">\u00b648  CI-116 affects Article II, Section 10\u2019s right of privacy and the balancing test between the right of privacy and the right to know. Aside from providing a new constitutional right to a particular class of persons\u2014crime victims\u2014which is a change in itself to the Constitution, CI-116 affects the balancing test employed between two preexisting constitutional provisions, the right of privacy and the right to know. Further, CI-116 gives the right of privacy to extended family members and others with similar relationships to the victim. Finally, CI-116(4)(b) specifically defines a victim as a \u201cperson\u201d who suffers direct or threatened harm. In contrast, the term \u201cperson,\u201d as recognized by the Delegates, includes corporations and other nonhuman entities. Montana Constitutional Convention, Verbatim Transcript, March 7, 1972, p. 1680. Accordingly, \u201cpersons\u201d entitled to a right to privacy under CI-116 would be different than under the constitutional provisions of Article II, Section 9, the public\u2019s right to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>know, and Section 10, an individual\u2019s right of privacy. We conclude Montana Constitution Article II, Sections 9 and 10, are substantively changed by CI-116(1)(f) and (4)(b) and that the people should have been afforded the right to vote on each amendment separately.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">\u00b649 To summarize, CI-116 adds a new Section 36 to Article II of Montana\u2019s Constitution, substantively changing the Constitution by enumerating rights for victims. The preexisting constitutional provisions that are substantively changed by CI-116 include Article VII, Section 2(3)\u2019s grant of power to the Supreme Court to govern attorney conduct; Article II, Section 21\u2019s right to bail; Article II, Section 20\u2019s criminal procedure rules; Article II, Section 24\u2019s rights of the accused; Article II, Section 9\u2019s right to know; and Article II, Section 10\u2019s right of privacy.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">\u00b650 Some of these provisions are related in the broad sense that they are implicated during a criminal prosecution. For example, Article II, Section 21\u2019s right to bail, Article II, Section 20\u2019s criminal procedure rules, and Article II, Section 24\u2019s rights of the accused all seek to protect an accused\u2019s fundamental rights during a criminal proceeding. However, a broad relationship between various provisions or a broad single subject does not satisfy the narrower interpretation of the separate-vote requirement we adopted in <em>Marshall </em>because voters did not have the opportunity to convey their opinions as to each constitutional provision changed by CI-116. For instance, voters should have had the option to independently decide if they wished to change the accused\u2019s right to bail by adding CI-116(1)(g) and/or (i); if they wished to change criminal procedure rules by adding CI-116(1)(g) and/or (i); if they wished to change rights of the accused by adding CI-116(1)(e) and/or (f); and if they wished to change the right to know and the right of privacy by adding CI-116(1)(f) and/or (4)(b). Further, not all of the affected provisions share even the broad connection of relating to a criminal prosecution or victim\u2019s rights. For example, attorney conduct, Article VII, Section 2(3), is not closely related to the right of privacy, Article II, Section 10, and neither of those provisions is closely related to the accused\u2019s right to bail, Article II, Section 21. Each of these amendments should have been presented to the electorate individually. Separate votes on each change would have protected the integrity of the vote and ensured that voters had complete control over each amendment made to the Montana Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"A8g\">\u00b651  CI-116 violates the separate-vote requirement and for that reason is void in its entirety. The Montana Constitution may only be amended pursuant to Article XIV. A constitutional amendment is invalid unless it is formed and adopted in a manner consistent with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>Article XIV. <em>Marshall, </em>\u00b6 26 (citing <em>Waltermire, </em>227 Mont. at 90-91, 738 P.2d at 1258). Moreover, a constitutional amendment submitted to the electorate in violation of the separate-vote requirement is void in its entirety because the constitutional \u201cdefect lies in the <em>submission </em>of [the proposed amendment] to the voters of Montana with more than one constitutional amendment.\u201d <em>Marshall, </em>\u00b6 25 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"Ax8\">\u00b652 CI-116 impliedly changed Montana\u2019s Constitution in numerous ways and we deem those changes to be both substantive and not closely related. When voters were required to vote \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d for CI-116 in its entirety, they were forced to vote for or against multiple, not closely related, changes to the Montana Constitution with one vote. Voters had no way to express their opinions as to each proposed constitutional change. The way in which CI-116 was <em>submitted </em>to the electorate violated the separate-vote requirement of Article XIV, Section 11. Therefore, we declare CI-116 void in its entirety. We void the enactment of CI-116, enjoin its implementation and enforcement, and decertify the election results with respect to CI-116.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">\u00b653 We reiterate that our decision is not based on the merits of the constitutional changes proposed by CI-116. Montana Constitution, Article XIV, Section 9, clearly grants the people initiative power to popularly amend the Constitution as they deem necessary, even if an amendment affects other portions of the Constitution. However, the procedure by which the Montana Constitution is amended must comply with existing constitutional requirements. Article XIV, Section 11, is specifically designed to ensure voters have complete control over each and every constitutional change. Our decision today is based solely on our conclusion that CI-116 contains more than one constitutional amendment, each of which required a separate vote under Article XIV, Section 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">\u00b654 We hold Montana Constitution, Article V, Section ll(3)\u2019s single-subject requirement does not apply to constitutional amendments. Therefore, we do not address MACo\u2019s argument that CI-116 violates Article V, Section 11(3). We expand upon our analysis of Montana Constitution, Article XIV, Section ll\u2019s separate-vote requirement and hold a proposed constitutional amendment violates the separate-vote requirement if it substantively changes two or more parts of the Constitution that are not closely related. Applying that analysis to CI-116, we hold CI-116 violates the separate-vote requirement and is therefore void in its entirety.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-8\">DATED this 1st day of November, 2017.</p>\n<judges id=\"b232-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES SHEA, WHEAT and SANDEFUR concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b212-7\"> The full text of CI-116 is attached as Appendix A and can be found online at https://perma.cc/VQ76-WRAJ.

The effect of this decision may be to significantly undermine, if not eliminate, the right of Montanans to amend the Constitution by initiative. This is not merely my opinion, but the experience of other courts. Respectfully, I believe the Court has failed to \u201capply the separate-vote requirement in a manner that does not encumber the right of the people to amend the Constitution.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-7\">\u00b656 Before discussing these concerns, I begin with the threshold concern that the Court has, in my view, violated justiciability principles by exercising original jurisdiction of this constitutional challenge. The judicial power of Montana\u2019s courts is limited to \u201cjusticiable controversies.\u201d <em>Reichert v. State, </em>2012 MT 111, \u00b6 53, 365 Mont. 92, 278 P.3d 455. This constitutional limitation, deriving from Article VII, Section 4(1) of the Montana Constitution, \u201cembodies the same limitations as are imposed on federal courts by the \u2018case or controversy\u2019 language of Article III\u201d of the United States Constitution. <em>Mont. Immigrant Justice Alliance v. Bullock, </em>2016 MT 104, \u00b6 18, 383 Mont. 318, 371 P.3d 430 (citing <em>Plan Helena, Inc. v. Helena Reg\u2019l Airport Auth. Bd., </em>2010 MT 26, \u00b6 6, 355 Mont. 142, 226 P.3d 567). Among the central components of justiciability is the doctrine of ripeness, which is concerned with whether the case presents an \u201cactual, present\u201d controversy. <em>Reichert, </em>\u00b6 54 <em>(citing Mont. Power Co. v. Mont. Pub. Serv. Commn., </em>2001 MT 102, \u00b6 32, 305 Mont. 260, 26 P.3d 91). The \u201cprudential component\u201d of the ripeness doctrine includes a fitness inquiry. <em>Reichert, </em>\u00b6 56. \u201cThe principal consideration under the fitness inquiry is whether there is a factually adequate record upon which to base effective review.\u201d <em>Reichert, </em>\u00b6 56 (citing <em>Havre Daily News, LLC v. City of Havre, </em>2006 MT 215, \u00b6 20, 333 Mont. 331, 142 P.3d 864). \u201cThe more the question presented is purely one of law, and the less that additional facts will aid the court in its inquiry, the more likely the issue is to be ripe, and vice-versa.\u201d <em>Reichert, </em>\u00b6 56 (citing <em>Havre Daily News, </em>\u00b6 20).</p>\n<p id=\"b232-8\">\u00b657 Similarly, the doctrine of judicial restraint cautions against the premature exercise of judicial authority. \u201cNeither federal nor state Constitution has granted such power\u201d to decide \u201cabstract differences <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>of opinion,\u201d but rather cases and controversies must be \u201creal controversies.\u201d <em>Hardy v.

Carr, </em>369 U.S. 186, 204, 82 S. Ct. 691, 703, 7 L. Ed. 2d 663, 678 (1962). We have explained that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-5\">This Court... has no jurisdiction to pronounce any statute, either of a state or of the United States, void, because irreconcilable with the constitution, except as it is called upon to adjudge the legal rights of litigants in actual controversies. In the exercise of that jurisdiction, it is bound by two rules, to which it has rigidly adhered: one, <em>never to anticipate a question of constitutional law in advance of the necessity of deciding </em>it; the other never to formulate a rule of constitutional law broader than is required by the precise facts to which it is to be applied.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b233-6\"><em>Roosevelt, </em>\u00b6 49 (citing <em>United States v.

Ed. 2d 524, 529-30 (1960) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"Aq2H\">\u00b658 Beyond fitness and judicial restraint principles, this Court is to exercise original jurisdiction over a declaratory judgment matter only when constitutional issues of statewide importance are involved, urgency and emergency factors exist making the normal appeal process inadequate, and \u201cthe case involves <em>purely legal questions </em>of statutory and constitutional construction.\u201d <em>Hernandez v.

VII, \u00a7\u00a7 1-2.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-7\">\u00b659 Consequently, the requisite questions are 1) whether there is concrete adverseness and not an \u201cabstract difference of opinion,\u201d 2) whether we are faced with purely legal questions of constitutional construction, and 3) whether there is a factually adequate record for effective review. However, the task of answering these questions in this case has been complicated by the Court\u2019s adoption, discussed below, of a complicated constitutional test requiring multiple determinations to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>be made for its application. While the issue as framed by the Court sounds in procedure\u2014whether there was error \u201cin the submission of [CI-116] to the voters of Montana,\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 51,\u2014in reality, the test requires the Court to analyze the substantive content and effect of the initiative, which, in turn, makes a factual record even more critical.</p>\n<p id=\"avk-dedup-0\">\u00b660 Here, as the Court notes, CI-116 has not yet been implemented. With no information about its implementation, Petitioners have theorized about its application to allege their injury. <em>See </em>Petitioners\u2019 briefing (petitioner MACo members will be required to \u201cseek tax increases, etc.\u201d and \u201cto hire victim-support staff and additional attorneys;\u201d petitioner county attorney will be injured \u201cvia raised taxes or fees, or fewer services;\u201d petitioner lawyer\u2019s \u201cability to serve her [victim] clients will be injured by diminished funding for victim-services\u201d). Petitioner Association of Criminal Defense Attorneys alleges simply that the rights of its members\u2019 clients to \u201ctraditional\u201d due process protections \u201cwill be diminished.\u201d Petitioner ACLU of Montana Foundation alleges in like fashion that \u201csome [of its members] will in the future be accused of a crime and be injured by application of Section 36.\u201d However, no factfinding whatsoever has occurred to confirm any of these assertions, and they are, at this stage, merely \u201cabstract differences of opinion\u201d regarding the impact of the implementation of CI-116, dependent upon how a court interprets and applies its provisions to particular circumstances. <em>Hardy, </em>206 Mont. at 526, 672 P.2d at 276.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">\u00b661 The Court states that \u201cthe question of whether CI-116 violates the Montana Constitution involves purely legal questions of constitutional interpretation,\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 2, but Petitioners\u2019 untethered allegations and absence of a record force the Court to make factual assumptions, such as its vague findings that CI-116 \u201cchanges a prosecutor\u2019s duties\u201d and will \u201cadd steps\u201d to criminal proceedings. Opinion, \u00b6\u00b6 36, 41. This problem is notable within the Court\u2019s analysis of the right to privacy in Issue If. Lacking a factual record of an actual privacy claim by a victim, the Court makes the assumption that any such claim would \u201csubstantively change I [\u201d Article II, Sections 9 and 10, and fails to recognize that the privacy interest created by CI-116 is textually much different. Opinion, \u00b6 48. Article II, Section 10 provides a broad-based privacy right to every individual, potentially applicable to any number of circumstances, as \u201cessential to the well-being of a free society.\u201d In contrast, the text of CI-116 recognizes a more limited right of privacy applicable to crime victims during a criminal proceeding. The right granted under CI-116 may well lead to claims that are narrower in scope and warrant a narrower remedy, which may be possible to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>harmonize with the Article II privacy right, as is our duty. Indeed, other jurisdictions have determined that victim rights of privacy do not create an absolute right, but rather a flexible right allowing courts to weigh the circumstances of each case. <em>See e.g. State v. Gonzalez, </em>912 P.2d 297, 300 (N.M. Ct. App. 1996) (rejecting argument that victims\u2019 rights amendment created an \u201cabsolute\u201d privilege against inspection of victim\u2019s medical records by the trial court or subsequent disclosure to other parties); <em>State of Maryland v. WBAL-TV, </em>975 A.2d 909, 922-23 (Md. Ct. App. 2009) (victims\u2019 right amendment \u201cdoes not ... provide victims with an absolute right to veto a request to access and copy court records\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">\u00b662 Similarly, the problem is notable in the Court\u2019s application of a prosecutor\u2019s duties in issue 1(b). The Court acknowledges that the text of CI-116(1)(j) gives a victim only a right to \u201cconfer with the prosecuting attorney,\u201d a limited right that is already common practice. Opinion, \u00b6 35. Lacking a factual record, the Court must assume how the provision will be applied, and concludes that a victim\u2019s right to confer with a prosecutor will \u201cchangel I the way a prosecutor must handle a criminal case.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 36. The court first reasons that a prosecutor \u201cmust obey the Montana Rules of Professional Conduct\u201d which prohibit \u201cprosecuting a charge that the prosecutor knows is not supported by probable cause.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 34. Then, the Court assumes that prosecutors will interpret a victim\u2019s right to \u201cconfer with the prosecuting attorney\u201d as tantamount to giving the victim the power to force prosecutions, in turn forcing the prosecutor to pursue a case that is \u201cnot supported by probable cause[,]\u201d and will thus affect our ability to make rules governing attorney conduct. Opinion, \u00b6 34-36. These assumptions stray from the limited right for a victim to meet with a prosecutor, which may be possible to harmonize with existing constitutional provisions. At this point, we do not know how the new constitutional interests will be raised and what remedy will be claimed. The Court is basing its constitutional ruling upon its deduction about how the provisions will be interpreted and applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">\u00b663 As we stated earlier in this case, \u201cwe use the same rules of construction to interpret constitutional initiatives that we use to interpret statutes.\u201d Mont. <em>Cnty. Attys. Ass\u2019n v. State, </em>387 Mont. 534, *2 (citation omitted). \u201cWhere there are several statutory provisions or particulars, the Court construes them, if possible, to give effect to all. Section 1-2-101, MCA.\u201d <em>Olson v. Daughenbaugh, </em>2001 MT 284, \u00b6 16, 307 Mont. 371, 38 P.3d 154. Likewise, we are to interpret provisions \u201cin a manner that gives effect to the legislature\u2019s intent if possible.\u201d <em>Weidow v. Uninsured Employers\u2019 Fund, </em>2010 MT 292, \u00b6 22, 359 Mont. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>77, 246 P.3d 704. However, we cannot now know if our interpretational duty to harmonize these constitutional provisions is possible to fulfill. Without a specific claim and a factual record, it is impossible to properly determine whether a constitutional conflict exists that cannot be reconciled.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">\u00b664 This is likewise true of the other constitutional conflicts that the Court perceives in CI-116. Without a factual record, the Court cannot determine whether it is possible to balance competing constitutional interests, a duty we are often compelled to perform. <em>See Galt v. State, </em>225 Mont. 142, 148, 731 P.2d 912, 916 (1987) (balancing the constitutional interests of private landowners under Article IX, Section 7 and Article II, Section 3 with the public\u2019s property interest in water under Article IX, Section <em>3); Krakauer v. State, </em>2016 MT 230, \u00b6 36, 384 Mont. 527, 381 P.3d 524 (competing constitutional interests should be addressed in a case-by-case basis and according to the facts of each case). How particular constitutional rights will be weighed and balanced with other such rights is a matter that can only be decided in the factual context of an actual, concrete legal dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">\u00b665 Because \u201cadditional facts [would] aid the court in its inquiry,\u201d <em>Reichert, </em>\u00b6 56, and decisively so, I would conclude that the petition fails to present a ripe issue, that we are not faced with purely legal questions of constitutional interpretation, and that the factual record is inadequate for effective review. While the Court offers that \u201cnormal litigation and appeal processes are inadequate because implementation of CI-116 is imminent,\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 2, this provides no basis under our precedent to exercise original jurisdiction. All enacted laws become imminently enforceable.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-7\">\u00b666 While I could stop at this point, my deep concerns about the Court\u2019s new test for application of the separate-vote requirement of Article XIV, Section 11, lead me to discuss the merits of the Court\u2019s constitutional analysis. In <em>Marshall v. State, </em>1999 MT 33, 293 Mont. 274, 975 P.2d 325, this Court invalidated CI-75 for violating the separate vote requirement of Article XIV, Section 11. We first found that \u201cCI-75 specifically amends three parts of Montana\u2019s Constitution.\u201d <em>Marshall, </em>\u00b6 24. The Court determined that the text of CI-75 expressly amended Article VIII, Article II, Section 18, and Article VI, Section 10, of the Constitution. <em>Marshall, </em>\u00b6 24. Then, the Court concluded \u201clblecause CI-75 expressly amends three parts of Montana\u2019s Constitution but does not allow a separate vote for each amendment, we hold that CI-75 violates Article XIV, Section 11, of Montana\u2019s Constitution.\u201d <em>Marshall, </em>\u00b6 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-8\">\u00b667 The Court in <em>Marshall </em>was guided by the Oregon Supreme Court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>decision in <em>Armatta v. Kitzhaber, </em>959 P.2d 49 (Or. 1998). Although acknowledging that the Montana Constitution differs from the Oregon Constitution, Opinion, \u00b6 22, the Court today more fully incorporates principles from <em>Armatta, </em>which, in my opinion, do not correspond to the Montana Constitution. The Court also adds additional requirements of its own to formulate a new test. The Court holds:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-5\">[T]he proper inquiry is whether, if adopted, the proposal would make two or more changes to the constitution that are substantive and not closely related. Moreover, if a proposed constitutional amendment adds new language to the constitution, that proposition is at least one change in and of itself.

That is, assuming that the constitutional provisions affected by the measure are closely related, we must determine whether the changes made to those related constitutional provisions are closely related. If they are closely related, the measure under consideration survives scrutiny under [the separate-vote requirement]. If they are not, it does not.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b237-10\">Opinion, \u00b6 29.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-11\">\u00b669 Thus, under the Court\u2019s new test, if a constitutional initiative adds new language to the constitution, \u201cthat proposition is at least one change in and of itself.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 28. Then, if the initiative \u201chas the effect of modifying\u201d an existing constitutional provision in a way that is deemed \u201cunrelated\u201d to the new text, whether such modification is express or implied, then such an \u201ceffect\u201d must also be counted as \u201cone additional change to the constitution,\u201d requiring a separate vote. Opinion, \u00b6 28. Applying the new test here, the Court concludes that CI-116 is invalid in seven different ways, reasoning that the initiative \u201caffects\u201d seven different existing provisions of the Montana Constitution, each of which required a separate vote, in addition to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>vote taken on the text of CI-116 itself, for a total of eight votes. Opinion, \u00b6\u00b6 31-49.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">\u00b670 This new formula, whereby a textual \u201cproposition\u201d is counted as \u201cone change in and of itself,\u201d while the measure\u2019s \u201ceffect\u201d upon an existing constitutional provision is counted as a second change, Opinion, \u00b6 28, is inconsistent with the language of Article XIV, Section 11, which is premised upon the concept of \u201camendments,\u201d not \u201cpropositions\u201d and \u201ceffects.\u201d The distinction is illustrated by the Court\u2019s analysis of the right to privacy.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">\u00b671 CI-116 provides that crime victims have the right \u201cto privacy, including the right to refuse an interview, deposition or other discovery request and to set reasonable conditions on the conduct of any interaction to which the victim consents.\u201d CI-116(1)(f). Applying its new test to this clause, the Court first reasons that CI-116 \u201cprovidfes] a new constitutional right to ... crime victims\u201d which is a \u201cchange in itselfl.]\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 48. Then the Court reasons that this new clause also \u201csubstantively change Is I\u201d Article II, Section 9, the public\u2019s right to know, and Section 10, an individual\u2019s right to privacy, which requires a separate vote because of how it \u201caffect! s I\u201d the two constitutional provisions, thus concluding that the clause must receive a separate vote for its adoption. Opinion, \u00b6 48. However, what has been lost in the application of the test\u2019s components is that the two concepts identified by the Court are two sides of the same amendment coin: one side is the new text, while the other side is the effect of the new text. Article XIV, Section 11, does not require separate votes for text and effect, but for wholly separate <em>amendments, </em>and we should analyze the issue in that way\u2014as we did in <em>Marshall.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b238-7\">\u00b672 To be clear, I agree with the Court that a constitutional initiative could have the effect of amending one or more articles of the Constitution even though the initiative\u2019s text does not expressly identify or add new language to the amended articles. Thus, I concur with the Court\u2019s assessment that in <em>Marshall, </em>n.2, we left open the possibility that such an initiative could run afoul of Article XIV, Section 11. Opinion, \u00b6 24.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> My disagreement lies in the test adopted by the Courtfor identifying these separate amendments. As recognized by other courts, the Court\u2019s test is problematic because it will lead to the invalidation of challenged constitutional initiatives that do not actually effectuate multiple amendments, severely undermining citizen rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>\u00b673 The <em>Armatta </em>approach\u2014that is, adoption of \u201can exacting functional relationship test\u201d for application of a constitutional separate-vote requirement, as the Court does here by way of its \u201cclosely-related\u201d requirement, Opinion, \u00b6\u00b6 28-29\u2014has been recognized as the \u201cminority rule\u201d among the states, and was once thought dormant. <em>Californians for an Open Primary v. McPherson, </em>134 P.3d 299, 322 (Cal. 2006) (explaining that the <em>Armatta </em>approach was \u201can essentially dormant minority position until the Supreme Court of Oregon\u2014without citing any of them or acknowledging the majority rule cases discussed above\u2014revived this strict interpretation of the separate-vote provision in 1998.\u201d). While courts must faithfully interpret their own unique constitutions, the majority and minority positions on this issue have been acknowledged in case law and scholarship, wherein it is recognized that \u201cit is clear\u201d the full <em>Armatta </em>approach \u201cis indeed a demanding one\u201d that leads to the predictable conclusion that \u201cmost proposed constitutional amendments will fail\u201d under its application. <em>McPherson, </em>134 P.3d at 322-23 (\u201cIndeed, in the few other jurisdictions that recently have embraced (explicitly or implicitly) Armatta\u2019s interpretation of the separate-vote provision under their own constitutions, the results have, with one exception, been consistent with the recent Oregon experience\u201d of striking down challenged initiatives.). Commentary has noted the difficulty in drafting an initiative that can survive application of the <em>Armatta </em>test. <em>See </em>Phillip Bentley, <em>Armatta v. Kitzhaber: A New Test Safeguarding the Oregon Constitution from Amendment by Initiative, </em>78 Or. L. Rev. 1139, 1154-56 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">\u00b674 This precipitous invalidation of initiatives likely will occur under the Court\u2019s analysis here. I note again the Court\u2019s analysis of CI-116\u2019s right to privacy provision. If CI-116, <em>in its entirety, </em>would have provided only that victims have a right \u201cto privacy, including the right to refuse an interview, deposition, or other discovery request and to set reasonable conditions on the conduct of any interaction to which the victim consents,\u201d <em>see </em>CI-116(1)(f), and said nothing else, it would nonetheless still violate the separate-vote requirement under the Court\u2019s test, and be invalid. This is because it adds a new section to the Constitution\u2014requiring one vote\u2014and also constitutes an \u201cunrelated\u201d implied change to the existing privacy provision\u2014requiring a second vote. <em>See </em>Opinion, \u00b6\u00b6 31-49. Few initiatives will survive the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>microscopic judicial review created herein.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">\u00b675 Instead, we should use the test that is consistent with the language of Article XIV, Section 11, our constitutional history,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and our case law. In <em>Marshall, </em>while taking \u201cguidance\u201d from <em>Armatta, </em>we did not adopt that holding wholesale. Rather, we employed an analysis founded upon our own Constitution, which is premised on whole \u201camendments.\u201d We made a straight-forward determination that the text of CI-75 amended the Constitution in three ways\u2014without regard to the numerous concepts employed here by the Court. <em>Marshall, </em>\u00b6 24. The same approach can be used for initiatives that amend the Constitution without the use of explicit language\u2014as the Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>suggested in footnote #2. The question is, does the initiative substantively constitute more than one amendment? Such an approach would not invalidate an initiative merely because it contained text that changed or revised more than one article of the Constitution, as long as those revisions were part of one complete, substantive amendment. Further, this straight-forward, constitutionally-based approach would avoid the flawed formulaic approach of assessing the text and the effect separately.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">\u00b676 Most importantly, so holding would affirm the promise of Article II, Section 2, of the Montana Constitution, whether the courts think it good policy or not:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-6\">\n<em>The people have the exclusive right of governing themselves as a free, sovereign, and independent state.
