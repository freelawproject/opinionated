We reverse and remand for further proceedings, addressing the following issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-7\">\n<em>Did the District Court err by accepting Defendant\u2019s no contest plea to the charge of sexual assault, and imposing a sentence based upon that plea?</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b326-8\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b326-9\">\u00b62 The State originally charged Hansen with four counts of felony incest, in violation of \u00a7 45-5-507(5), MCA, based on allegations that Hansen had sexually abused his eight-year-old granddaughter. That offense carried a mandatory prison sentence of 100 years with no parole eligibility for the first 25 years, subject to exceptions. Section 45-5-507(5)(a)(i), MCA (2013). The State also charged Hansen with one count of obstructing a peace officer, a misdemeanor, after Hansen tried to evade officers during the investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-10\">\u00b63 Hansen entered into a plea agreement with the State, wherein he agreed to enter a no contest plea to an amended charge of sexual assault under \u00a7 45-5-502(3), MCA (sexual assault of a victim under the age of 16 by an offender at least 3 years older than the victim). This offense carried a minimum sentence of four years, with exceptions, and a maximum of life or 100 years. Section 45-5-502(3), MCA. The State agreed to dismiss the remaining charges and to recommend to the District Court that Hansen be sentenced to 50 years in Montana State Prison (MSP) with 25 years suspended. The agreement allowed Hansen to make any sentencing recommendation he believed to be appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"Ax_6\">\u00b64 The District Court conducted a change of plea hearing, finding that a proper basis existed for entry of the no contest plea after explaining in detail to Hansen the difference between a guilty plea and a no contest plea. The District Court found that Hansen was making a knowing, voluntary, and intelligent plea. Before accepting the plea, the District Court informed Hansen that it was not bound by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>sentencing recommendations in the plea and advised him of the maximum possible penalty, life or 100 years in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">\u00b65 At sentencing, the State recommended a sentence of 50 years with 25 years suspended, consistent with the plea agreement, and Hansen\u2019s counsel requested a 20-year sentence, with 10 years suspended. The District Court sentenced Hansen to 60 years in MSP with no time suspended. Hansen appeals, challenging the validity of his plea and sentence, and raising a claim of ineffective assistance against his trial counsel for negotiating a plea agreement premised upon an illegal plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b327-7\">\u00b66 We review whether a District Court had statutory authority to impose a sentence <em>de novo. State v. Ring, </em>2014 MT 49, \u00b6 15, 374 Mont. 109, 321 P.3d 800 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b327-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b327-9\">\u00b67 <em>Did the District Court err by accepting Defendant\u2019s no contest plea to the charge of sexual assault, and imposing a sentence based upon that plea?</em></p>\n<p id=\"ARM\">\u00b68  Imposing a unique restriction upon the entry of a criminal plea, the Legislature has provided that a \u201ccourt may not accept a plea of nolo contendere in a case involving a sexual offense,\u201d with exceptions not at issue here. Section 46-12-204(4), MCA. \u201cSexual offense\u201d is defined to include sexual assault under \u00a7 45-5-502(3), MCA. Section 46-23-502(9)(a), MCA. Consequently, there is an express statutory prohibition upon entry of a no contest plea to a charge of sexual assault. Further, we have held that a plea agreement provision that violates a statute can render the agreement \u201cvoid and unenforceable.\u201d <em>State v. Cleveland, </em>2014 MT 305, \u00b6 22, 377 Mont. 97, 338 P.3d 606 (citing \u00a7 28-2-701, MCA; \u00a7 28-2-604, MCA).</p>\n<p id=\"b327-12\">\u00b69 We discussed a similar plea in <em>Hardin v. State, </em>2006 MT 272, 334 Mont. 204, 146 P.3d 746, involving a defendant\u2019s no contest plea to the charge of sexual intercourse without consent. In a postconviction proceeding, Hardin claimed the district court lacked jurisdiction to accept his plea and impose sentence, due to the statutory prohibition upon no contest pleas in sex offense cases. <em>Hardin, </em>\u00b6 14. Framing this as a jurisdictional issue, Hardin argued that it could be raised at any time, including within a postconviction proceeding. <em>Hardin, </em>\u00b6 14. We rejected Hardin\u2019s argument, holding that his claim was \u201cmore accurately characterized as a claim that his sentence was illegal as exceeding statutory authority,\u201d and because \u201cHardin did not challenge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>the legality of his sentence on direct appeal,\u201d the claim was procedurally barred. <em>Hardin, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 15-16 (citations omitted). While Hardin did not raise the issue on direct appeal from his criminal conviction, Hansen does so.</p>\n<p id=\"acs-dedup-0\">\u00b610  \u201cA district court\u2019s authority to impose a sentence is defined and constrained by statute.\u201d <em>State v. Ruiz, </em>2005 MT 117, \u00b6 12, 327 Mont. 109, 112 P.3d 1001 (citations omitted). \u201cA sentence not based on statutory authority is an illegal sentence.\u201d <em>Ruiz, </em>\u00b6 12 (citations omitted). Here, entry of the no contest plea to sexual assault was an explicit violation of \u00a7 46-12-204(4), MCA. We conclude that Hansen\u2019s sentence, imposed upon his no contest plea, is illegal for exceeding a district court\u2019s statutory authority. <em>See Hardin, </em>\u00b6 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">\u00b611 The State acknowledges that the District Court erred in accepting Hansen\u2019s no contest plea, but argues we should affirm the conviction and sentence because Hansen did not object to the sentence before the District Court, thereby failing to preserve the issue. Hansen responds that we should undertake <em>Lenihan </em>review<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> or, alternatively, conclude that his trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance for permitting him to enter an invalid plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-7\">\u00b612 The <em>Lenihan </em>rule provides a sentence not objected to in the district court that is \u201cillegal or exceeds statutory mandates,\u201d <em>Lenihan, </em>184 Mont. at 343, 602 P.2d at 1000, and not merely an \u201cobjectionable\u201d statutory violation, <em>State v. Kotwicki, </em>2007 MT 17, \u00b6 13, 335 Mont. 344, 151 P.3d 892 (citations omitted), may be reviewed on appeal. We have explained that, where a district court, \u201cif provided the opportunity to consider the error now asserted on appeal, could nevertheless have imposed the same sentence, the illegality requirement of the <em>Lenihan </em>exception has not been met.\u201d <em>State v. Bull, </em>2017 MT 247, \u00b6 11, 389 Mont. 56, 403 P.3d 670 (citations omitted). Here, if provided the opportunity to consider the error of Hansen\u2019s invalid no contest plea, it is clear that the District Court could not have imposed a valid sentence upon Hansen.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-8\">\u00b613 Therefore, we void the plea agreement and vacate the sentence imposed herein. We remand the matter to the District Court to allow Hansen to enter a legal plea to the original charges, enter a new plea agreement, or to proceed to trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-9\">\u00b614 Reversed and remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<judges id=\"b328-10\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES BAKER, McKINNON and SHEA concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b326-11\"> Regarding plea nomenclature, \u201cno contest\u201d and <em>\u201cnolo contendere\u201d </em>are interchangeable. <em>See Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>1209 (Bryan A.
