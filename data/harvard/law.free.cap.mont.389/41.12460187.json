(GRBR). We affirm, addressing the following issue:</p>\n<p id=\"b68-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>\n<em>Did the District Court err by granting summary judgment to the defendant pursuant to the \u201cEquine Activities Act\u201d?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b68-4\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">\u00b62 GRBR is a Montana corporation owned by Don Gaynor (Don) and operated by Don and his wife, Nancy Gaynor (Nancy). GRBR offered guest cabins and trail horse rides near Whitefish, Montana, providing about 1,000 trail rides per year. Fishman was a participant on a GRBR trail ride in June 2014.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">\u00b63 Sometime before the day of the ride, Fishman called GRBR and booked a trail ride for himself and some relatives. During the call, Don asked Fishman for his height and weight to determine which horse would work best for him. Fishman stated he was over 6 feet tall and weighed 210 pounds. Based on Fishman\u2019s size, Don chose the horse, \u201cBig,\u201d a large horse capable of carrying heavier riders, for Fishman to ride. Big\u2019s saddle and associated tack are specifically designed for him.</p>\n<p id=\"Az0y\">\u00b64 GRBR presented Fishman with a Supervised Equine Rental Agreement and Release Form (Agreement) prior to the trail ride. The Agreement stated that \u201csaddle girths (fasteners around the horse\u2019s belly) may loosen during equine activity, which may cause slippage of the saddle and the potential fall from the horse.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Fishman read and signed the Agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-7\">\u00b65 GRBR\u2019s standard pre-ride procedure includes saddling the horses and checking saddle cinches a minimum of three (3) times before a riding participant mounts the horse. Don saddled Big before Fishman arrived and, consistent with procedure, Big\u2019s saddle cinch was checked several times before the horse was mounted. A wrangler rode Big before Fishman arrived and the saddle cinch was checked again.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-8\">\u00b66 After the participant mounts the horse, GRBR wranglers give oral instructions and observe the participant riding the horse around the corral in a safety check to address any equipment adjustments, observe how the participant manages the horse, provide instruction, and answer questions or concerns. Participants are instructed to ask for help if they believe something is wrong. Fishman had a low level of riding experience, and Don explained to him how to hold the reins and direct Big\u2019s movements. Fishman then rode Big around the corral. Nancy noticed Fishman was leaning to one side and tipping the saddle. Nancy instructed Fishman to shift his weight and to keep the saddle <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>centered over the horse. Fishman complied before departing the corral for the trail.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-4\">\u00b67 Upon completion of the safety check, the ride participants were taken out on the trail. Nancy, on horseback, led the riders out of the corral and down the trail at a walking pace. During the ride, Fishman attempted to re-center the saddle by shifting back and forth in the stirrups. Nancy became aware Fishman was having a problem when Fishman yelled at her. Nancy observed Fishman sliding to one side and then attempting to jump off the horse, landing on the ground. The saddle remained affixed on the horse, but resting on its side. Big did not buck or react during the incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">\u00b68 Fishman filed this damage action against GRBR, asserting negligence generally and specifically mentioning only inaction by Nancy as the apparent assertion of breach of duty, and not referencing the actions of GRBR\u2019s other personnel: \u201cNancy Gaynor never physically touched or inspected Neill\u2019s saddle after it was placefd] upon his horse Big, nor after she noticed it was off center and told Neill to recenter, and at no time before or after Neill mounted Big.\u201d GRBR moved for summary judgment, arguing Fishman\u2019s accident was caused by a risk inherent in equine activities for which liability is precluded under \u00a7 27-1-727, MCA. Fishman also moved for summary judgment, arguing Nancy failed in the duty to inspect the saddle, which satisfied an exception to the liability protection of the equine statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">\u00b69 Concluding there were no genuine issues of material fact, the District Court granted summary judgment to GRBR, reasoning that \u201camong the risks inherent to equine activities is the risk that saddle girths may loosen during a ride and cause slippage of the saddle, which may result in a fall. It is out of this very type of inherent risk\u2014of which [Fishman] was specifically warned in the Agreement and of which he acknowledged his understanding\u2014that Fishman\u2019s negligence claim arises....\u201d The Court further concluded that Fishman had failed to establish that a statutory exception applied, reasoning that \u201cFishman has not alleged or shown that any piece of tack or equipment broke, was otherwise defective or did not work or perform as expected.\u201d Fishman appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-7\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b69-8\">\u00b610 We review de novo a district court\u2019s grant or denial of summary judgment, applying the same criteria of M. R. Civ. P. 56 as a district court. <em>Pilgeram v. GreenPoint Mortg. Funding, </em>Inc., 2013 MT 354, \u00b6 9, 373 Mont. 1, 313 P.3d 839. Summary judgment is appropriate when the moving party demonstrates both the absence of any genuine issues <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>of material fact and entitlement to judgment as a matter of law. M. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(3); <em>Bird v. Cascade Cnty., </em>2016 MT 345, \u00b6 9, 386 Mont. 69, 386 P.3d 602. We review a district court\u2019s conclusions of law to determine whether they are correct. <em>Pilgeram, </em>\u00b6 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">\u00b611 <em>Did the District Court err by granting summary judgment to the defendant pursuant to the \u201cEquine Activities Act\u201d?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">\u00b612 Sections 27-1-725 through -727, MCA, commonly referred to as the \u201cEquine Act\u201d or \u201cEquine Activities Act,\u201d states that \u201cthe policy of the state of Montana\u201d is \u201cthat a person is not liable for damages sustained by another solely as the result of risks inherent in equine activities if those risks are or should be reasonably obvious, expected, or necessary to persons engaged in equine activities.\u201d Section 27-1-725, MCA. We have stated that the \u201cpractical effect\u201d of the Act is to \u201cpronounce that equine activity sponsors do not have a duty to protect participants from unavoidable risks, or the inherent risks of equine activities of which the participant is or should be aware,\u201d explaining that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-7\">If the injury is due to an inherent risk of equine activities and the participant expected that risk, then the equine activity sponsor cannot have been negligent\u2014the injury was due to an unavoidable risk of which the participant was aware, so the sponsor could not have breached any duties to warn of or eliminate the risk. Thus, so long as the participant expects a risk inherent in equine activities, pursuant to the statute, the equine activity sponsor may not be held liable for injury suffered as a result of that risk.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AFY\"><em>McDermott v. Carie, </em>2005 MT 293, \u00b6 18, 329 Mont. 295, 124 P.3d 168.</p>\n<p id=\"APaU\">\u00b613 The Act provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-8\">Equine activity liability limitations. (1) Except as provided in subsections (2) and (3), an equine activity sponsor or an equine professional is not liable for an injury to or the death of a participant engaged in an equine activity resulting from risks inherent in equine activities.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-9\">(2) An equine participant shall act in a safe and responsible manner at all times to avoid injury to the participant and others and to be aware of risks inherent in equine activities.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b70-10\">Section 27-1-727(1), (2), MCA. The Act further defines the term, \u201crisks inherent in equine activities,\u201d as \u201cdangers or conditions that are an integral part of equine activities,\u201d and provides a non-exhaustive list of such dangers. Section 27-1-726(7), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-11\">\u00b614 Fishman does not contest the District Court\u2019s determination that the circumstances of his accident come within the statutory definition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>of \u201crisks inherent in equine activities,\u201d and thus cannot form the basis of a liability claim under \u00a7 27-1-727(1), MCA. However, Fishman argues that the District Court erred in concluding that his claim does not fall within an exception to the general rule, as set forth in \u00a7 27-1-727(3), MCA, which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b71-5\">(3) Subsection (1) does not apply:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b71-6\">(a) if the equine activity sponsor or the equine professional:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b71-7\">(i) provided the equipment or tack and the equipment or tack caused the injury because the equine activity sponsor or equine professional failed to reasonably and prudently inspect or maintain the equipment;</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b71-8\">Fishman argues that Nancy\u2019s failure to inspect the equipment and tack he was using caused the accident, and thus his claim comes within the exception stated in \u00a7 27-l-727(3)(a)(i), MCA, and permits his claim.</p>\n<p id=\"AUo\">\u00b615 We first note that Fishman did not allege that the equipment or tack failed, was improperly maintained, or was otherwise defective. Further, although Fishman focuses solely on Nancy\u2019s personal actions or inaction, it is an undisputed material fact that the subject equipment and tack was repeatedly checked and inspected by the equine sponsor prior to the trail ride to insure they were working properly. Fishman makes no showing whatsoever that these inspections were not performed \u201creasonably and prudently,\u201d as required by \u00a7 27-1-727(3)(a)(i), MCA, for his claim. The fact that the cinch nonetheless loosened during the ride underscores that this occurrence is an inherent danger or condition of equine activity, about which Fishman was expressly advised.</p>\n<p id=\"A99\">\u00b616  The District Court also properly determined that the material facts of the case are not in dispute. Fishman argues that there were differing accounts of the communications that occurred between Nancy and Fishman in the corral before the trail ride, but these communications are not material to whether the accident was caused by an inherent risk and whether the equipment was reasonably and prudently inspected. Fishman argues that the District Court went too far by excusing liability on the basis of the Agreement he had signed, which he argues cannot, in itself, release an equine sponsor from liability. While Fishman is correct that liability cannot be excused on the basis of an Agreement, <em>see McDermott, </em>\u00b6 19, the District Court did not, in our view, apply the protections of the Equine Act solely on the basis of the Agreement. Rather, the District Court considered the Agreement in the context of whether Fishman was aware of the inherent risks of horseback riding. Its ultimate decision was premised upon the circumstances of this accident coming within the inherent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>risks of equine activity as defined in the Equine Act, and not within the statute\u2019s exception to that liability limitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-4\">\u00b617 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b72-5\">JUSTICES McKINNON, BAKER and SANDEFUR concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b68-9\"> The term \u201cgirth\u201d may be used interchangeably with \u201ccinch,\u201d which is defined as a girth for a saddle or pack. <em>Oxford Am. Dictionary </em>136 (Oxford Univ. Press, Inc. 1999).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"ANG\">JUSTICE WHEAT,</author>\n<p id=\"AOj\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">\u00b618 I respectfully dissent from the majority. I would reverse and remand because the District Court resolved issues of disputed fact. In my opinion, the maj ority overlooks the dispute of material fact between Fishman and GRBR as to whether Fishman\u2019s slipping during the ride was an inherent danger or condition of equine activity, or if it was a product of improper equipment inspection.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-7\">\u00b619 GRBR knew the cinch was loose during the safety check when Fishman began to slip. GRBR attributed the slip to a shift in weight by Fishman and directed him accordingly to keep his weight centered. Fishman and other riders were then taken out on the trail. While on the trail, Fishman\u2019s saddle again slipped; this time Fishman had to jump off the horse. The majority states that \u201cthe fact that the cinch nonetheless loosened during the ride underscores that this occurrence is an inherent danger or condition of equine activity.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 15. However, this characterization of the saddle slippage erroneously ignores that the cinch was not tightened properly by GRBR prior to hitting the trail.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-8\">\u00b620 Further, GRBR was on notice that Fishman\u2019s cinch was loose through observations during the safety inspection and through Fishman\u2019s own communications with the trail guide. However, the majority side-stepped the safety inspection dispute by stating \u201cFishman makes no showing whatsoever that these inspections were not performed \u2018reasonably and prudently,\u2019 as required by \u00a7 27-1-727(3)(a)(i), MCA, for his claim.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 15. The majority also concludes the communications between Fishman and GRBR as \u201cnot material to whether the accident was caused by an inherent risk and whether the equipment was reasonable and prudently inspected.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 16. In my opinion, such conclusions overlook the dispute of fact as to whether the cinch was not reasonably and prudently inspected by GRBR after they observed that the cinch was loose or that the cinch became loose during the ride as a condition of equine activity. This dispute of fact should be left for a jury to resolve.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-9\">\u00b621 This Court has long adhered to the proposition that \u201csummary judgment is an extreme remedy that should never be a substitute for a trial on the merits if a controversy exists over a material fact.\u201d <em>Corporate Air v. Edwards Jet Ctr. Mont. Inc., </em>2008 MT 283, \u00b6 24, 345 Mont. 336, 190 P.3d 1111. The majority interprets the Equine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>Activities Act too narrowly and thereby deprives an injured person of the right to have the facts of their claim decided by a jury rather than by a judge\u2019s expansive interpretation of an immunity statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-4\">\u00b622 For these reasons, I dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
