Following this Court\u2019s reversal and remand of a summary judgment order, Judge Edward P. McLean assumed jurisdiction in the case. Judge McLean retired after the trial, and Chief Justice Mike McGrath issued an order calling him to active service to preside over the case. Following Judge McLean\u2019s entry of final judgment, the Labairs appealed. This Court reversed and remanded for a new trial. Approximately two months after remittitur issued, the Labairs moved to substitute Judge McLean. Judge McLean denied the Labairs\u2019 motion as untimely. The Labairs appeal. We affirm. We consider the Labairs\u2019 arguments that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-8\">1. The time never started running on their deadline for substitution because the Clerk of District Court did not give statutorily-required notice of Judge McLean\u2019s assumption of jurisdiction; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-9\">2. Judge McLean lost jurisdiction after appeal from the final judgment, and the case reverted to his replacement once the appeal was decided.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b393-10\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b393-11\">\u00b62 The case is before this Court for the third time on appeal. We detailed the factual background in the previous two appeals, <em>Labair v. Carey, </em>2012 MT 312, 367 Mont. 453, 291 P.3d 1160 <em>(Labair I), </em>and <em>Labair v. Carey, </em>2016 MT 272, 385 Mont. 233, 383 <em>P.3d 226 (Labair II). </em>We restate here only the procedural facts relevant to this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-12\">\u00b63 The Labairs hired Carey to pursue a potential medical malpractice claim against their obstetrician, Dr. Thomas Baumgartner, after the death of their newborn son. Carey failed to file the medical malpractice claim before the statute of limitations expired. The Labairs then filed a legal malpractice claim against Carey.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-13\">\u00b64 The District Court, Judge John Larson presiding, granted summary judgment to Carey in November 2011. The Labairs appealed. We reversed in <em>Labair I </em>and remanded for trial. <em>Labair I, </em>\u00b6 40.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-14\">\u00b65 After remittitur issued in <em>Labair I, </em>the Labairs timely filed a motion for substitution of district court judge under \u00a7 3-1-804(12), MCA. Judge Larson called in Judge McLean, who accepted jurisdiction. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>Judge McLean presided over a jury trial in March 2015. The jury entered a special verdict in favor of Carey. Judge McLean retired effective April 30, 2015, and Judge Leslie Halligan assumed jurisdiction over the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">\u00b66 On June 1, 2015, Chief Justice McGrath entered an Order calling Judge McLean back into active service to assume judicial authority of this case and several others. The Order authorized Judge McLean \u201cto proceed with any and all necessary hearings, opinions and orders, including final resolution of said matters.\u201d It stated further: \u201cA copy of this Order shall be filed with the District Court Clerk of Missoula County with a request that copies be sent to counsel of record.\u201d The District Court Clerk filed the Order as directed but apparently failed to send a copy to counsel for either party.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">\u00b67 The District Court held a telephonic status conference with the parties the same day that Chief Justice McGrath entered his Order. A minute entry from that status conference states that \u201cthe Court advised counsel that Chief Justice McGrath has asked Judge McLean to hear argument on the costs issue as the Court conducted trial in the above cause.\u201d The District Court sent a copy of the minute entry to counsel for both parties. The Labairs claim on appeal that \u201c[t]his was the only notice counsel received regarding Judge McLean\u2019s assumption of jurisdiction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">\u00b68 On September 22, 2015, Judge McLean held a hearing on Carey\u2019s motion for sanctions and on the reasonableness of costs, at which counsel for both parties appeared and presented argument. Judge McLean also entered a final judgment that same day in accordance with the jury\u2019s special verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-8\">\u00b69 The Labairs appealed Judge McLean\u2019s final judgment. We reversed in <em>Labair II, </em>reasoning that the Labairs were entitled to judgment as a matter of law on the issue of their entitlement to damages. <em>Labair II, </em>\u00b6 27. We remanded for a new trial to determine the amount of the Labairs\u2019 damages. <em>Labair II, </em>\u00b6 27. We decided <em>Labair II </em>on October 25, 2016, and remittitur was filed with the District Court on November 21, 2016.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-9\">\u00b610 Fifty-seven days later, on January 17, 2017, the Labairs filed a motion for substitution of Judge McLean. They stated in their motion: \u201cPlaintiffs have received no notice from the Court who has been assigned but were verbally informed by clerks within the Clerk\u2019s Office that they thought Judge McLean was assigned to the case. Plaintiffs have received no notice of this assignment.\u201d Judge McLean denied the Labairs\u2019 motion as untimely. He concluded that he \u201cwas assigned to the matter by the Chief Justice on June 1, 2015,\u201d and that \u201che remains in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>jurisdiction.\u201d The Labairs appeal the denial of their motion for substitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">\u00b611 A district court\u2019s determination whether to substitute a judge is a question of law that we review for correctness. <em>Mines Mgmt. v. Fus, </em>2014 MT 256, \u00b6 5, 376 Mont. 375, 334 P.3d 929.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b395-8\">\u00b612 The Labairs argue that the District Court did not provide them with proper notice of Judge McLean\u2019s assumption of jurisdiction, in violation both of \u00a7 3-1-804(7), MCA, and of their constitutional right to due process, and that Judge McLean therefore should have granted their motion for substitution. They contend further that Judge McLean\u2019s jurisdiction expired when he issued his September 2015 Final Judgment, which in their view constituted \u201cfinal resolution\u201d of the case under the terms of Chief Justice McGrath\u2019s Order. They claim that Judge McLean\u2019s subsequent order denying their motion for substitution is void because he lacked jurisdiction over the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-9\">\u00b613 This Court\u2019s rule governing judicial substitution, codified in \u00a7 3-1-804(12), MCA, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-10\">When a judgment or order is reversed or modified on appeal and the cause is remanded to the district court for a new trial,... each adverse party is entitled to one motion for substitution of district judge. The motion must be filed, with the required filing fee, within 20 calendar days after the remittitur from the supreme court has been filed with the district court. There is no other right of substitution in cases remanded by the supreme court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b395-11\">This Court\u2019s decision in <em>Labair II </em>reversed and remanded the case for a new trial. <em>Labair II, </em>\u00b6 27. Remittitur was filed with the District Court on November 21, 2016. Under the terms of \u00a7 3-1-804(12), MCA, the Labairs had twenty days thereafter to file a motion for substitution. They did not file their motion until January 17, 2017\u2014fifty-seven days after remittitur. On its face, the Labairs\u2019 motion for substitution was untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-12\">\u00b614 The Labairs contend nonetheless that their motion for substitution should have been granted because they were not afforded proper notice of Judge McLean\u2019s assumption of jurisdiction over the case. They claim that the District Court\u2019s failure to serve notice violated the terms of Chief Justice McGrath\u2019s Order and of \u00a7 3-1-804(7), MCA, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-13\">When a new district judge has accepted jurisdiction, the clerk of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>court shall provide a copy of the assumption of jurisdiction to the first district judge to whom the case was assigned and to each attorney or party of record. A certificate of service must be attached to the assumption of jurisdiction form in the court file.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AoXk\">We have held that \u201cwhen retired district judges are called in to \u2018exercisel I the powers of a district judge on a temporary basis,\u2019 they are judges presiding in district courts\u2019 as contemplated by the introductory clause of \u00a7 3-1-804, MCA.\u201d <em>Cushman v. Mont. Twentieth Judicial Dist. Court, </em>2015 MT 311, \u00b6 8, 381 Mont. 324, 360 P.3d 492 (internal citation omitted). The Chief Justice\u2019s \u201cspecific assignments of retired judges\u201d are \u201cwithin the intended scope of the right to substitution under \u00a7 3-1-804, MCA.\u201d <em>Cushman, </em>\u00b6 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">\u00b615 We have addressed district court violations of the rule\u2019s notice requirement in two orders on petitions for writ of supervisory control. In <em>Torres v. Eleventh Judicial District Court, </em>No. OP 14-0489, 376 Mont. 549, 347 P.3d 265 (table) (Aug. 19, 2014), we granted supervisory control due in part to the district court\u2019s noncompliance with \u00a7 3-1-804(7), MCA. The original district court judge in that case retired and was replaced by Judge Ulbricht. <em>Torres </em>at 1. The district court clerk never sent notice of Judge Ulbricht\u2019s assumption of jurisdiction to Torres. <em>Torres </em>at 1-2. Torres was unaware of the new presiding judge until he filed a motion on an unrelated matter. <em>Torres </em>at 2. As soon as Torres became aware of Judge Ulbricht\u2019s involvement in the case, he filed a motion for substitution of district court judge, which the district court denied as untimely. <em>Torres </em>at 2. We reversed, reasoning that Torres had filed his motion for substitution promptly after learning of Judge Ulbricht\u2019s role in the case. <em>Torres </em>at 2-3.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">\u00b616 By contrast, in <em>Smith v. Fourth Judicial District Court, </em>No. OP 13-0702, 373 Mont. 440, 318 P.3d 172 (table) (Oct. 29, 2013), we denied a petition for writ of supervisory control despite the district court\u2019s failure to comply with the requirements of \u00a7 3-1-804(7), MCA. In that case, the district court did not serve notice on Smith of Judge John Larson\u2019s acceptance of jurisdiction. <em>Smith </em>at 2. Smith did not argue that he did not have notice of Judge Larson\u2019s assumption of jurisdiction; he contended only that the district court\u2019s failure to comply with the requirements of \u00a7 3-1-804(7), MCA, should have voided Judge Larson\u2019s subsequent actions in the case. <em>Smith </em>at 1-2. We noted that Smith was aware of Judge Larson\u2019s jurisdiction, and that he had \u201cfiled briefs and appeared at the hearing before Judge Larson on his motions to suppress.\u201d <em>Smith </em>at 2. We therefore concluded that Smith had not \u201cidentified any way in which he [had] been prejudiced by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>procedural irregularity.\u201d <em>Smith </em>at 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">\u00b617 The District Court in the present case failed to comply with either \u00a7 3-1-804(7), MCA, or Chief Justice McGrath\u2019s Order by not serving on the Labairs\u2019 counsel notice of Judge McLean\u2019s assumption of jurisdiction when the Order was issued on June 1, 2015. But as in <em>Smith, </em>and unlike in <em>Torres, </em>this \u201cprocedural irregularity\u201d did not prejudice the Labairs because the Labairs had actual notice of Judge McLean\u2019s involvement in the case. <em>Smith </em>at 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">\u00b618 Judge McLean resumed judicial authority in the case on June 1, 2015. The District Court had not conducted any activity between Judge McLean\u2019s retirement and the June 1, 2015 Order. On the same day as Chief Justice McGrath\u2019s Order, counsel for both parties participated in a telephonic hearing in which the court informed them that Chief Justice McGrath had asked Judge McLean to \u201chear argument on the costs issue\u201d in the case. The District Court Clerk filed a copy of Chief Justice McGrath\u2019s Order in the case record. The Labairs\u2019 counsel was present at a September 22, 2015 hearing on Carey\u2019s motions for sanctions and on the reasonableness of costs, over which Judge McLean presided. Judge McLean issued final judgment that same day, a copy of which was sent to the Labairs\u2019 counsel. The Case Register Report identified Judge McLean as the presiding judge from the time of his assumption of jurisdiction to present, including after the November 2016 remittitur of <em>Labair II.</em></p>\n<p id=\"Adq8\">\u00b619  The Labairs could not reasonably have concluded, based on these facts, that anyone other than Judge McLean presided over their case. The court record at all relevant times clearly identified Judge McLean as the presiding judge, and no other judge participated in any hearing or entered any rulings. The purpose of the notice rule in \u00a7 3-1-804(7), MCA, is to ensure that parties are informed when a new judge assumes jurisdiction. Here, the District Court\u2019s failure to comply with \u00a7 3-1-804(7), MCA, did not prejudice the Labairs, because the Labairs had actual notice when Judge McLean assumed jurisdiction in the case. Absent prejudice, we will not disturb the District Court\u2019s denial of the Labairs\u2019 motion for substitution. <em>See </em>M. R. Civ. P. 61 (\u201cAt every stage of the proceeding, the court must disregard all errors and defects that do not affect any party\u2019s substantial rights.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"A_5\">\u00b620  The Labairs argue that the Clerk\u2019s failure to give written notice of the June 1, 2015 Order also violated their due process rights. \u201cWe have said that the hallmarks of due process are notice and opportunity to be heard.\u201d <em>In re B.W.S., </em>2016 MT 340, \u00b6 12, 386 Mont. 33, 386 P.3d 595 (citing <em>Kulstad v. Maniaci, </em>2010 MT 248, \u00b6 41, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>358 Mont. 230, 244 P.3d 722). \u201cNotice must be reasonably calculated to inform parties of proceedings which may directly and adversely affect their legally protected interests.\u201d <em>Steab v. Luna, </em>2010 MT 125, \u00b6 22, 356 Mont. 372, 233 P.3d 351 (citation and internal quotations omitted). As discussed above, the Labairs had actual notice of Judge McLean\u2019s assumption of jurisdiction over their case. The court\u2019s failure to serve official notice on them under \u00a7 3-1-804(7), MCA, did not \u201cadversely affect their legally protected interests\u201d where they had actual knowledge of the judge presiding in their case. <em>Steab, </em>\u00b6 22. Their claim of a due process violation fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">\u00b621 Finally, the Labairs argue that Judge McLean\u2019s denial of their motion for substitution is of no effect because his jurisdiction over the case had expired before he issued that ruling. But Judge McLean did not automatically lose jurisdiction in this case when the Labairs appealed from the final judgment. Although jurisdiction over a case passes from a district court to this Court when a party files a notice of appeal, <em>see, e.g., Powers Mfg. Co. v. Leon Jacobs Enters., </em>216 Mont. 407, 411, 701 P.2d 1377, 1380 (1985), jurisdiction vests again in the district court upon reversal and remand, <em>Zavarelli v. Might, </em>239 Mont. 120, 122, 779 P.2d 489, 491 (1989) (\u201cWe determine that a district court, on reversal and remittitur from this Court Tor further proceedings,\u2019 is reinvested with full jurisdiction of the cause.\u201d). And a district court does not lose jurisdiction to rule on ancillary matters after the appeal is taken. <em>See Powder River Cnty. v. State, </em>2002 MT 259, \u00b6 27, 312 Mont. 198, 60 <em>P.3d 357 (citing Powers Mfg. Co., </em>216 Mont. at 411-12, 701 P.2d at 1380). The presidingjudge does not change when notice of appeal is filed. After our reversal and remand in <em>Labair II, </em>jurisdiction over the case automatically returned to the District Court, with Judge McLean presiding. <em>See Zavarelli, </em>239 Mont. at 122, 779 P.2d at 491.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">\u00b622 The Labairs assert that, under the terms of Chief Justice McGrath\u2019s June 1, 2015 Order, Judge McLean\u2019s jurisdiction expired when he issued final judgment. Article VII, Section 6(3), of the Montana Constitution and \u00a7 19-5-103, MCA, allow the Chief Justice of the Montana Supreme Court to \u201cconfer jurisdiction and authority to retired judges as district court judges.\u201d <em>Capital One, NA v. Guthrie, </em>2017 MT 75, \u00b6 17, 387 Mont. 147, 392 P.3d 158. \u201cThe authority the Chief Justice can confer is comprehensive, up to and including all duties of the sitting district court judge.\u201d <em>Capital One, NA, </em>\u00b6 17 (citing \u00a7 19-5-103, MCA). Chief Justice McGrath\u2019s Order called in Judge McLean to \u201cproceed with any and all necessary hearings, opinions and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>orders, including <em>final resolution </em>of said matters.\u201d (Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"AtUg\">\u00b623 In the Labairs\u2019 view, \u201cfinal resolution\u201d of the case occurred when Judge McLean issued final judgment. To support their argument, they cite legal authority\u2014including <em>Kline v. Murray, </em>79 Mont. 530, 257 P. 465 (1927), and M. R. Civ. P. 54(a)\u2014for the proposition that a judgment may be considered final prior to an appeal to the Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">\u00b624 Although Judge McLean issued final judgment, it was not final resolution of the case. The controversy between the Labairs and Carey\u2014the litigation over Carey\u2019s liability for legal malpractice\u2014is ongoing. In <em>Labair II, </em>we remanded for a new trial, limited to damages resulting from Carey\u2019s negligence. <em>Labair II, </em>\u00b6 27. \u201cFinal resolution\u201d of this case will not occur until either settlement between the parties or a new trial and the exhaustion of any appeals. Judge McLean\u2019s final judgment did not resolve the controversy between the parties and therefore did not constitute \u201cfinal resolution\u201d of the case. Under the terms of Chief Justice McGrath\u2019s Order, Judge McLean retained jurisdiction at the time of his January 2017 denial of the Labairs\u2019 motion for substitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b399-7\">\u00b625 The Labairs had actual notice of Judge McLean\u2019s assumption of jurisdiction, Judge McLean retained jurisdiction after our reversal and remand <em>inLabairll, </em>and the Labairs filed their motion for substitution after the twenty-day deadline under \u00a7 3-1-804(12), MCA. The District Court correctly denied the Labairs\u2019 motion, and its denial of their motion is affirmed. The case is remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<judges id=\"b399-8\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES SHEA, SANDEFUR and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
