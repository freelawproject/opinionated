This Court exercises supervisory control on a case-by-case basis, as it is an extreme remedy. M. R. App. P. 14(3). Supervisory control is appropriate \u201cwhen urgency or emergency factors exist making the normal appeal process inadequate, when the case involves purely legal questions, and when one or more of\u2019 three enumerated circumstances exist. M. R. App. P. 14(3). We accepted supervisory control over this matter on March 22, 2017, concluding the double jeopardy issue was appropriate for supervisory control pursuant to <em>Keating v. Sherlock, </em>278 Mont. 218, 924 P.2d 1297 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b185-15\">\u00b63 We reverse the Municipal Court\u2019s order denying Huertas\u2019s motion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>to dismiss and address the following issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-5\"><em>Did the Municipal Court abuse its discretion in declaring a mistrial and err in concluding that double jeopardy did not bar Huertas\u2019s </em>retrial?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b186-7\">\u00b64 The City of Billings (City) charged Huertas with Partner or Family Member Assault (PFMA) following an incident between Huertas and alleged victim L.H. The Municipal Court set Huertas\u2019s trial for January 20, 2017, at which time a jury was impaneled and sworn. During its case-in-chief, the City called L.H. to the stand. The City asked L.H. if she wanted to be there and she replied that she did not. When asked, \u201cAre you only here because of a court-ordered subpoena?\u201d she responded, \u201cI am,\u201d and indicated that she was unhappy testifying. The City did not inquire further into the subpoena and proceeded with its direct examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-8\">\u00b65 After the City completed its questioning of L.H., defense counsel Lisa Bazant (Bazant) began cross-examining L.H. During cross-examination, the following exchange occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-9\">[Bazant]: Did members of the Billings Police Department try to get you to testify a particular way? ... Were you visited by the Billings Police Officer yesterday?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-10\">[L.H.]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-11\">[Bazant]: And did that officer attempt to influence your testimony today?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-12\">[L.H.]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-13\">[Bazant]: Influence you in a way that it would be more toward the prosecution\u2019s\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-14\">[City]: I\u2019d like to object. May we approach?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b186-15\">The Judge allowed counsel to approach, and after an inaudible conversation excused the jury but asked the parties to remain. The jury left the courtroom and L.H., still under oath, explained the interaction at issue. L.H. testified that the night before trial, at approximately 11:00 p.m., Billings Police Officer LaMantia (Officer LaMantia) served her a subpoena requiring her to appear at the trial as one of the City\u2019s witnesses. L.H. said her roommate let Officer LaMantia into their home and Officer LaMantia sat next to L.H. on the couch.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-16\">\u00b66 Before L.H. explained more, the Judge asked the City if it knew about the interaction. The City said the information was a \u201csurprise\u201d that had a \u201csignificant impact\u201d on its case and relayed two main concerns. First, if what L.H. alleged was true, Officer LaMantia <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>engaged in witness tampering and he needed the opportunity to respond to L.H.\u2019s allegations. Second, if the allegations were true, the City needed to declare a mistrial because the City was unfairly prejudiced by the information. If the trial moved forward after the jury heard L.H.\u2019s testimony, the City needed to investigate Officer LaMantia\u2019s actions and contemplated that it may have to dismiss the case. On the other hand, the City observed that if the case moved forward and Huertas was acquitted, it would then be \u201ctoo late\u201d to address the allegations. The City concluded it was unable to proceed with the new, very significant, information because it needed to interview Officer LaMantia and L.H.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">\u00b67 Bazant agreed that the information had a significant impact on the case and expressed concern that L.H., the City\u2019s own witness, may have been inappropriately influenced by an officer. The Judge responded that she was \u201cnot going to put the City Prosecutor\u201d in an unfavorable light because \u201c[h]e didn\u2019t know.\u201d During this discussion both Bazant and the Judge alluded to the fact that there was a preexisting relationship between Officer LaMantia and Huertas. While we cannot ascertain the exact nature of their relationship from our review of the record, it is clear that Huertas, Officer LaMantia, and L.H. were personally familiar with one another at the time the subpoena was served. The Judge expressed serious concern about the events, stating that if Officer LaMantia behaved as alleged \u201cthe City is put at disadvantage unbeknownst to them.\u201d The City reported it had asked a sergeant to serve the subpoena and did not know Officer LaMantia was going to serve it.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">\u00b68 The Judge then asked L.H. to explain more about what happened the night before. L.H. testified that Officer LaMantia and another officer served her the subpoena in the presence of her roommate. L.H. said that, after giving her the document, Officer LaMantia wanted to give her \u201cfriendly advice as a friend.\u201d L.H. testified that Officer LaMantia told L.H. she needed to be at trial so Huertas would be \u201cpunished for everything that he has done.\u201d The Judge responded, \u201c[B]ut he didn\u2019t tell you to testify. He just said you needed to be there. It\u2019s a Subpoena. You are under Subpoena so he did do that.\u201d L.H. responded, stating that Officer LaMantia told her to \u201cignore the uniform\u201d and that he, \u201cas a friend,\u201d was telling her she needed to be at trial to \u201ctell them exactly what happened.\u201d Based on these allegations, the following exchange occurred between L.H., Bazant, and the Judge:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ax6\">[Judge]: [I]t is a Subpoena, and you are subpoenaed, and you do need to be here because you were subpoenaed, and as a friend or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>whatever he says. Is that all he said to you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-5\">[L.H.]: Honestly, I was a mess. I don\u2019t\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-6\">[Judge]: Is that all he said to you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-7\">[Bazant]: Did he encourage you to testify one way or the other?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"aab-dedup-1\">[Judge]: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-8\">[L.H.]: Yes, he enc\u2014he did though.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-9\">[Judge]: You just told me, stated to me that he just said you need to be there and tell the truth. Did he not say\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-10\">[L.H.]: But in a negative light.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-11\">[Judge]: And what do you mean a negative light?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-12\">[L.H.]: In that he wanted to see [Huertas] punished even though, he, I told him that\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-13\">[Judge]: He wanted to see [Huertas] punished. Okay. So that\u2019s a personal vendetta or something.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-14\">[L.H.]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-15\">[Judge]: I don\u2019t know, between the two. But he said he wanted to see him punished. But did he tell you how to testify.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-16\">[L.H.]: No, I guess not.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b188-17\">\u00b69 The Judge stated that the interaction did not go \u201cfar enough\u201d for her; that Officer LaMantia was simply serving a subpoena. She asked the City if it thought there was an issue, and the City started to discuss the other people present during the interaction and indicated there may be police body camera recordings of the interaction. The Judge interrupted the City, stating, \u201cWell, she hasn\u2019t indicated that he influenced her how to testify. He served a subpoena .... But what she testified earlier that he influenced her testimony or whatnot, the jury\u2019s already heard it. And honestly that\u2019s not what she\u2019s saying to me right now.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b188-18\">\u00b610 The Judge observed an inconsistency between L.H.\u2019s testimony in front of the jury, where she said she was influenced by an officer, and L.H.\u2019s testimony outside the presence of the jury, where she said differently. The fact that the jury heard potentially inaccurate information concerned the Judge. The City began a conversation about how the situation should proceed, moving for a mistrial in the process:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AWB\">[City]: So what I would suggest to deal with this situation moving forward is that [L.H.] be given the opportunity to be contacted by a detective to get a statement regarding her conversation with Officer [LaMantia] that\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-19\">[Judge]: And they should pull this record and listen to what she had to say today, too, as well.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-20\">[City]: And they should pull this, and they need to get all the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>[body camera footage], and <em>I\u2019m asking for a mistrial </em>because there is no way that I would\u2019ve had knowledge about that that until just\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-5\">[Judge]: Well, and it\u2019s not even fit knowledge is this what she says to me right now, and what was said on the record is a huge disadvantage and a conflict, and I don\u2019t think it can be remedied. I really don\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b189-7\">\u00b611 The Judge asked the defense for its position regarding the City\u2019s request for a mistrial, and Bazant responded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-8\">Well, I do hate to go forward but, or I mean to hate to go forward in such a manner that we\u2019re going to do, cause some problems later. Listening to what [L.H.] is saying now versus what I had thought was her testimony earlier, it was more than just, you know, a vendetta with Huertas and [Officer LaMantia]. It was, it was more, [L.H.], you need to testify this way so he does get (inaudible).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b189-9\">The Judge answered, contemplating the testimony\u2019s impact on the jury and suggesting she was inclined to declare a mistrial:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-10\">Right, and that was your impression. When you were going to cross examine her or, or, and honestly that\u2019s how she testified on the record, and then the jurors already been poisoned, and I think it is a mistrial. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any way we can remedy that, I really don\u2019t. And, and I am going to tell you that you will, if we do this mistrial, we\u2019re going to have to have a date certain again</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"pAyP\">\n<img class=\"blockquote\" height=\"37\" src=\"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAHIAAAAlAQAAAAC2LYCfAAAAQ0lEQVR4nGP8z4AMDjIxoIJRPun8/w5P/jacQPD/Pbj358Ae3OqZFJRYHFygAv////9f//3f//f///////8A4xCLHwBLtBxIZDuvHQAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==\" width=\"114\"/>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b189-11\">The City pointed out that it needed to investigate the circumstances surrounding the subpoena\u2019s service, but the Judge had already decided L.H. was not improperly influenced by Officer LaMantia:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-12\">Well, you know, I still believe we could go on even though this may have happened. What she testified to, I don\u2019t think it needs to come up, and that\u2019s up to you guys, and that will delay the trial longer if you guys want to get into it. I don\u2019t believe what she stated on the record goes that far. He should\u2019ve never served it. He may have an issue with the Defendant, but I don\u2019t believe with what she just stated that he told her that you, it\u2019s pretty much you need to testify he needs to be punished, not you need to testify ... don\u2019t say the truth or whatever. So that isn\u2019t what I got from this, but it still poisoned our jury, and we were moving along quite nicely. We\u2019re going to have to set a date certain. ... This needs to go forward.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b190-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>Bazant agreed that more investigation needed to occur, but did not say anything about the mistrial:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-5\">Well, I think it does need to go forward, and I think we do need to hear from [L.H.\u2019s roommate] and, you know, listen to the [body cameras]. Because I think if she was feeling threatened, whether or not he was as, you know, it would be really stupid for an officer to say you need to testify (inaudible).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">The Judge responded to Bazant and definitively declared a mistrial:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"afy-dedup-0\">Yeah, but the point is is she\u2019s supposed to be here today, and it sounds like she\u2019s not having any problem holding her own. Okay? And she\u2019s going to testify to what she believes the truth is. And if that\u2019s an issue that happened, that\u2019s between the City of Billings Police Department if it gets investigated. It doesn\u2019t need to come back into this courtroom. I can tell you that because I don\u2019t think that she\u2019s having any problem with what she wants to testify. I don\u2019t believe she was influenced by him. She\u2019s here today. She was influenced, but she was subpoenaed, she has to be here. ... It\u2019s a mistrial, and what is our new [trial] date? ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b190-7\">\u00b612 The parties started to talk about a new trial date and witness availability. The Judge stated the City may need time to investigate the subpoena situation, but she still did not believe that the \u201cinformation will be relevant for the trial.\u201d She asked the parties if they agreed to that, and Bazant again emphasized further investigation, responding, \u201cI want to see what\u2019s on [the body camera]. I want to hear how it came down. I mean as I said\u2014\u201d The Judge interrupted Bazant, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-8\">Well, and even if it, if he even did influence her how to testify or not to testify, I don\u2019t believe at this point she was influenced by anything. And when the trial day comes, I don\u2019t believe that, I think again it\u2019s between the City and their officer, and investigation, internal investigation if that\u2019s what happened.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AIo\">The City reminded the Judge that witness tampering does not have to be successful in order for it to be a crime, but the Judge re-emphasized that, even if Officer LaMantia was prosecuted, the incident would not have \u201cany bearing on this case because I do not believe that [L.H.] was influenced by it.\u201d The Judge then inquired as to the best dates for a retrial and ultimately rescheduled Huertas\u2019s trial for February 14, 2017.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-9\">\u00b613 On February 6, 2017, Huertas filed a motion in Municipal Court to dismiss the PFMA charge, contending further prosecution would violate his constitutional rights which protect him from being twice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>placed in jeopardy for the same offense. He argued the City moved for a mistrial because it knew it was unlikely to secure a conviction following L.H.\u2019s testimony. Huertas emphasized that his right to have his case decided by that particular tribunal, a right \u201cat the core of the constitutional protection to be free from double jeopardy,\u201d would be violated if he was retried. One day later, on February 7, 2017, the Municipal Court issued a one-page order, summarily denying Huertas\u2019s motion to dismiss without addressing his legal arguments. Following the denial, Huertas petitioned the District Court for a Writ of Mandamus or Other Appellate Relief, asking the District Court to vacate the Municipal Court\u2019s denial and grant his motion to dismiss. The District Court denied the petition, holding the case was not appropriate for its review because Huertas had a \u201cplain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law\u201d as provided in \u00a7 27-26-102(2), MCA. The District Court observed Huertas adequately preserved his constitutional objections which could be raised on appeal if necessary after the Municipal Court entered final judgment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Huertas then filed a petition for Writ of Supervisory Control, asking this Court to direct the Municipal Court to dismiss the criminal proceeding against him on double jeopardy grounds. The Municipal Court temporarily vacated Huertas\u2019s retrial and the case is now pending our decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">\u00b614 This Court reviews a trial court\u2019s declaration of a mistrial for an abuse of discretion. <em>State v. Cates, </em>2009 MT 94, \u00b6 21, 350 Mont. 38, 204 P.3d 1224 (citing <em>State v. Flores, </em>1998 MT 328, \u00b6 12, 292 Mont. 255, 974 P.2d 124). We will affirm a trial judge\u2019s decision if he or she acted rationally and responsibly in declaring a mistrial. <em>Cates, </em>\u00b6 21 (citing <em>Flores, </em>\u00b6 12).</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">\u00b615 A trial court\u2019s denial of a defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss criminal charges on double jeopardy grounds is a question of law that we review for correctness. <em>State v. Stone, </em>2017 MT 189, \u00b6 10, 388 Mont. 239, 400 P.3d 692 (citing <em>Cates, </em>\u00b6 22; <em>State v. Maki, </em>2008 MT 379, \u00b6 9, 347 Mont. 24, 196 P.3d 1281).</p>\n<p id=\"b192-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b192-8\">\u00b616 <em>Did the Municipal Court abuse its discretion in declaring a mistrial and err in concluding that double jeopardy did not bar Huertas\u2019s </em>retrial?</p>\n<p id=\"b192-9\">\u00b617 The Fifth Amendment of the United States Constitution, applicable to the states via the Fourteenth Amendment, and Article II, Section 25, of the Montana Constitution protect citizens from being placed twice in jeopardy for the same offense. U.S. Const. amend. V (\u201c[N]or shall any person be subject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy ....\u201d); Mont. Const. art. II, \u00a7 25 (\u201cNo person shall be again put in jeopardy for the same offense previously tried in any jurisdiction.\u201d). These constitutional safeguards are important because the prosecution, \u201cwith all its resources and power should not be allowed to make repeated attempts to convict an individual for an alleged offense ....\u201d <em>Cates, </em>\u00b6 30 (quoting <em>United States v. Dinitz, </em>424 U.S. 600, 606, 96 S. Ct. 1075, 1079 (1976)) (internal quotations and citations omitted). Accordingly, these provisions seek to provide finality for a criminal defendant. <em>State v. Carney, </em>219 Mont. 412, 416, 714 P.2d 532, 534 (1986) (quoting <em>United States v. Jorn, </em>400 U.S. 470, 479, 91 S. Ct. 547, 554 (1971)).</p>\n<p id=\"arn-dedup-0\">\u00b618  During a jury trial, jeopardy attaches as soon as the jury is impaneled and sworn. <em>Cates, </em>\u00b6 30 (citing <em>Carney, </em>219 Mont. at 417, 714 P.2d at 535). When a mistrial is declared after jeopardy attaches, \u201cthe defendant\u2019s valued right to have his trial completed by a particular tribunal is also implicated.\u201d <em>Cates, </em>\u00b6 31 <em>(citing Dinitz, </em>424 U.S. at 606, 96 S. Ct. at 1079) (internal quotations and citations omitted). In this case, jeopardy undisputedly attached when the jury was impaneled and sworn at the start of trial on January 20, 2017. Thus, Huertas\u2019s right <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>to be free from double jeopardy is clearly implicated. The question now before the Court is whether retrying Huertas for the PFMA charge would violate his federal and state constitutional rights to be free from double jeopardy.</p>\n<p id=\"A5A\">\u00b619  After a defendant\u2019s double jeopardy rights are implicated and a mistrial is declared, a \u201csecond criminal trial is barred unless there was a manifest necessity to terminate the trial or the defendant acquiesced in the termination.\u201d <em>Cates, </em>\u00b6 33 (quoting <em>Carney, </em>219 Mont. at 417, 714 P.2d at 535) (internal omissions, quotations, and citations omitted). Manifest necessity to discontinue a trial exists when \u201cparticular circumstances manifest a necessity for so doing, and when failure to discontinue would defeat the ends of justice.\u201d <em>Cates, </em>\u00b6 33 (quoting <em>Carney, </em>219 Mont. at 417, 714 P.2d at 535; <em>Wade v. Hunter, </em>336 U.S. 684, 690, 69 S. Ct. 834, 838 (1949)). A mistrial is an \u201cexceptional remedy,\u201d <em>State v. Miner, </em>2012 MT 20, \u00b6 13, 364 Mont. 1, 271 P.3d 56 (quoting <em>State v. Novak, </em>2005 MT 294, \u00b6 26, 329 Mont. 309, 124 P.3d 182), and therefore a \u201cremedial action short of a mistrial is preferred unless the ends of justice require otherwise.\u201d <em>Novak, </em>\u00b6 26. Where there are only \u201ctechnical errors or defects that do not affect the substantial rights of the defendant\u201d a mistrial is inappropriate. <em>Miner, </em>\u00b6 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">\u00b620 In <em>Carney </em>we recognized that the key word \u201cnecessity\u201d cannot be interpreted literally when analyzing a claim of double jeopardy. <em>Carney, </em>219 Mont. at 417, 714 P.2d at 535 (adopting the United States Supreme Court\u2019s manifest necessity explanations from <em>Wade, </em>336 U.S. at 690, 69 S. Ct. at 838, and <em>Arizona v. Washington, </em>434 U.S. 497, 506-09, 98 S. Ct. 824, 831-32 (1978)). Instead of a literal interpretation, we observe necessity in terms of degree, and sufficient manifest necessity in the double jeopardy context requires a high degree of necessity. <em>Carney, </em>219 Mont. at 417, 714 P.2d at 535. To determine what degree of necessity exists in a given case we must undertake an individualized and fact-intensive inquiry:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-7\">The question whether that \u201chigh degree\u201d has been reached is answered more easily in some kinds of cases than in others. At one extreme are cases in which a prosecutor requests a mistrial in order to buttress weaknesses in his evidence. Although there was a time when English judges served the Stuart monarchs by exercising a power to discharge a jury whenever it appeared that the Crown\u2019s evidence would be insufficient to convict, the prohibition against double jeopardy as it evolved in this country was plainly intended to condemn this \u201cabhorrent\u201d practice ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>Thus, the strictest scrutiny is appropriate when the basis for the mistrial is the unavailability of critical prosecution evidence, or when there is reason to believe that the prosecutor is using the superior resources of the State to harass or to achieve a tactical advantage over the accused.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-5\">At the other extreme is the mistrial premised upon the trial judge\u2019s belief that the jury is unable to reach a verdict, long considered the classic basis for a proper mistrial....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b194-6\"><em>Carney, </em>219 Mont. at 417, 714 P.2d at 535 (quoting <em>Arizona, </em>434 U.S. at 506-09, 98 S. Ct. at 831-32) (omissions in <em>Carney). </em>Furthermore, a \u201cmore stringent manifest necessity standard applies when a trial court considers declaring a mistrial without the defendant\u2019s request or consent.\u201d <em>State v. Partin, </em>287 Mont. 12, 16, 951 P.2d 1002, 1004 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"A7p\">\u00b621 With these considerations in mind, we now address whether there was manifest necessity to discontinue Huertas\u2019s trial. At the time the Municipal Court declared a mistrial, L.H. had only made two potentially damaging statements in the presence of the jury. She answered \u201cyes\u201d to the question of whether she was visited by an officer and \u201cyes\u201d to the question of whether the officer attempted to influence her testimony. Immediately, the City objected and asked to approach the bench before L.H. could answer Bazant\u2019s third question. At this stage of the proceeding, the City still could have rehabilitated L.H. through redirect examination. This is especially true in light of the knowledge the City acquired through the subsequent inquiry made by the court and parties regarding the incident. The Judge questioned L.H. outside of the presence of the jury to clarify the circumstances surrounding the subpoena\u2019s service and was convinced that L.H. was not improperly influenced by Officer LaMantia. Significantly, L.H.\u2019s responses to the questions were sufficient enough to demonstrate to the Judge that nothing inappropriate occurred when the subpoena was served\u2014similar questioning could have occurred in front of the jury to demonstrate the same. Instead, the Judge believed L.H.\u2019s testimony could not be remedied because the jury was already \u201cpoisoned,\u201d an opinion she reiterated throughout the questioning and subsequent conversation. The Judge also emphasized that L.H.\u2019s testimony put the City at a \u201chuge disadvantage\u201d and, in her opinion, presented a significant conflict that could not be remedied. The Judge\u2019s statements that the City did not know about the circumstances of the subpoena\u2019s service, that the City was disadvantaged by the testimony, that a conflict now existed, and that the jury was \u201cpoisoned\u201d do not demonstrate manifest necessity to terminate the proceeding, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>particularly when remedial measures were available.</p>\n<p id=\"AFF\">\u00b622  Furthermore, we must note that L.H. was the City\u2019s witness. The City was ultimately responsible for serving its own witness, albeit a hostile one, with a subpoena to ensure her presence at trial. The fact that the witness testified to the circumstances of the service in an unexpected light does not create manifest necessity sufficient to justify a new trial. We have no reason to believe the City used the service to improperly achieve some sort of tactical advantage, but the City\u2019s simple lack of knowledge that the subpoena was served as alleged by L.H. is not persuasive\u2014the City could have easily discovered information regarding the service, as the City\u2019s own police officer served the subpoena on the City\u2019s own witness. The Judge articulated no conditions that enable us to conclude manifest necessity obliged the trial\u2019s termination; nor do we find support for such a determination from our review of the record. We therefore conclude the Municipal Court abused its discretion in declaring a mistrial because there was no manifest necessity.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">\u00b623 Even though no manifest necessity exists in this case, Huertas may still be retried if he acquiesced in the trial\u2019s termination. A defendant acquiesces in a trial\u2019s termination \u201cif the totality of the circumstances and the affirmative conduct of the defendant show that she waived her right to object to the termination of trial proceedings.\u201d <em>Cates, </em>\u00b6 35. This Court rejected in <em>Cates </em>the notion that acquiescence or \u201cimplied consent\u201d could be \u201cinferred from a defendant\u2019s \u2018statements or silences\u2019 or a failure to object to the termination.\u201d <em>Cates, </em>\u00b6 34 <em>(quoting Keating, </em>278 Mont. at 227-29, 924 P.2d at 1302-03). Instead, this Court held that a retrial is not barred when the defendant\u2019s affirmative conduct, combined with the totality of the circumstances, demonstrates a waiver of the right to object to the termination of trial proceedings. <em>Cates, </em>\u00b6 35. Our focus was on the totality of the circumstances surrounding the termination of the proceedings and whether the defendant\u2019s <em>affirmative </em>conduct demonstrated a waiver of the right against retrial. In <em>Cates, </em>this Court rejected the approach that a waiver could be implied only from a defendant\u2019s \u201csilence or passive assent.\u201d <em>Cates, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 35, 36.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">\u00b624 In <em>Cates, </em>we held Cates could be retried because he affirmatively waived his right to object to the trial\u2019s termination. <em>Cates, </em>\u00b6 36. Our decision was based on the totality of the circumstances, but of primary significance was the fact that Cates moved for a mistrial on two separate grounds before the district court declared a mistrial <em>sua sponte </em>following the prosecution\u2019s motion for a mistrial. <em>Cates, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 9-11, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>36, 39-40. We decided that Cates\u2019s mistrial motions \u201cdemonstrated that he was clearly willing to give up his valued right to have his trial completed by the particular tribunal which was sworn and impaneled ... which right is at the core of the constitutional protection to be free from double jeopardy.\u201d <em>Cates, </em>\u00b6 36 <em>(citing Dinitz, </em>424 U.S. at 606, 96 S. Ct. at 1079) (internal quotations omitted). Cates had the opportunity, after the district court declared a mistrial, to be heard and object, but he did not withdraw his previous motions for a mistrial or otherwise object. <em>Cates, </em>\u00b6 36. Instead, one of Cates\u2019s attorneys \u201caffirmatively offered that he had nothing to say\u201d and the other \u201cthanked the prosecution team for coming forward.\u201d <em>Cates, </em>\u00b6 36. We decided those circumstances amounted to more than \u201cmere silence or passive assent\u201d and were sufficient to demonstrate an affirmative waiver of Cates\u2019s right to object to the termination of the proceedings. <em>Cates, </em>\u00b6 36.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">\u00b625 Considering the totality of the circumstances in this case and evaluating any affirmative conduct by Huertas, we conclude a waiver of Huertas\u2019s right to object to the termination of the proceedings has not been demonstrated. The specifics of this case are notably different than those of <em>Cates. </em>Unlike in <em>Cates, </em>where the defendant requested a mistrial on two separate grounds prior to the court\u2019s ruling, here Huertas never requested a mistrial. Thus, Huertas did not demonstrate a willingness to give up his right to have his trial completed by a particular tribunal the way Cates did. Additionally, in <em>Cates </em>we found it important that Cates had the opportunity, after the court declared a mistrial, to be heard and object. The same opportunity to be heard was not present in this case, as Bazant was interrupted several times when she tried to state Huertas\u2019s position regarding the mistrial. As Bazant attempted, multiple times, to emphasize that an investigation into the events of the subpoena\u2019s service needed to occur, the Judge simply highlighted the fact that she had already decided that those circumstances had no bearing on the PFMA trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">\u00b626 Furthermore, none of Huertas\u2019s actions or the statements of his attorney can be construed as affirmative conduct waiving his right to object to the termination of the proceedings. Bazant\u2019s comments such as, \u201cI do hate to go forward ... in such a manner that we\u2019re going to ... cause some problems later;\u201d \u201cI think it does need to go forward\u201d for more investigation; and \u201cI want to see what\u2019s on [the body camera]\u201d do not amount to affirmative conduct evidencing a waiver by Huertas of his right to object to the termination of the proceedings. The City and Bazant were both focused on investigating the circumstances of the subpoena\u2019s service, while the Judge had already decided nothing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>improper occurred and moved on to declaring a mistrial before the parties were able to precisely state their positions or properly object.</p>\n<p id=\"AkW_\">\u00b627  Where Huertas did not request a mistrial, made no affirmative statements waiving his right to object to the termination of the proceedings, and was frustrated in his opportunity to be heard, we cannot conclude that a waiver has been demonstrated. Therefore, retrying him for the PFMA charge would violate his right to be free from double jeopardy.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">\u00b628 Retrying Huertas for the PFMA charge would violate his federal and state fundamental constitutional rights to be free from double jeopardy. There was no manifest necessity to discontinue the trial and Huertas\u2019s conduct did not demonstrate a waiver of his right to object to termination of the proceedings and to a retrial. The Municipal Court\u2019s denial of Huertas\u2019s motion to dismiss the PFMA charge is reversed and the case is dismissed with prejudice. Accordingly,</p>\n<p id=\"b197-7\">IT IS ORDERED that the Municipal Court\u2019s February 7, 2017, Order Denying Motion to Dismiss for Violation of Right to Due Process and/or Right to be Free from Double Jeopardy is REVERSED.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-8\">IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Municipal Court of the City of Billings, Case No. TK 2016-4035, is DISMISSED with prejudice because retrying Huertas would violate his constitutional right to be free from double jeopardy.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-9\">The Clerk is directed to provide a true copy of this Opinion and Order to all counsel of record, to the Clerk of the Thirteenth Judicial District, the Clerk of the Billings Municipal Court, and to the presiding judges.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-10\">DATED this 31st day of October, 2017.</p>\n<judges id=\"b197-11\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES WHEAT, BAKER and SHEA concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b191-5\"> With respect to the District Court\u2019s conclusion that Huertas had an adequate remedy of appeal, we reiterate our statements made in <em>Keating, </em>278 Mont. at 224, 924 P.2d at 1300, which was also the basis for our decision to accept supervisory control in the instant proceeding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-6\">Both the U.S. Constitution, Fifth Amendment and the Montana Constitution, Article II, Section 25, protect individuals from being twice placed in jeopardy. If those guarantees are to have any significance, they require that the prohibition must be given effect prior to, not after, the second trial. If, as the State argued, Keating proceeded with a second trial and were convicted, he could appeal on the basis of double jeopardy. This Court could vacate the conviction. However, vacating the conviction would not change the fact that Keating would have been \u201cput in jeopardy.\u201d The same would hold true even if Keating were acquitted in the second trial. That is, the acquittal would not alter the fact that, in being tried a second time, he was again placed in jeopardy of being convicted. The constitutional prohibition is designed to prevent the individual from being put at risk of conviction at a second trial. Once he endures the second trial, regardless of conviction or acquittal, he has incurred the risk; he has been put in \u201cjeopardy,\u201d and that fact cannot be remedied or expunged after the fact.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
