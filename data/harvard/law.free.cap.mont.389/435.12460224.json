M. C. R. App.). We restate the narrow issues on appeal as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b462-9\">\n<em>1.Did the District Court erroneously dismiss Tenants\u2019 appeal for failure to timely file an appellate brief before ruling on their justice court motion to proceed in forma pauperis for purposes of\u00a7 25-33-201, MCA?</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b462-10\">\n<em>2. Did the Justice Court erroneously enter a money judgment in excess of its $12,000jurisdictional limit?</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b462-11\">\u00b62 We affirm on Issue 1 but reverse and remand on Issue 2 for entry of judgment in favor of Alto Jake Holdings, LLC (Landlord), in conformance with the jurisdictional limit for justice court money judgments.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-12\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b462-13\">\u00b63 Tenants successively rented two mobile homes on adjoining properties, 1188 and 1190 Patrick Creek Road, in Kalispell, Montana, from Alto Jake Holdings, LLC. Tenants assert that they executed a written, one-year lease agreement calling for them to rent the upper trailer (1188) during November and December 2015, and then to rent the lower trailer (1190) from January 2016 through October 2016. James Sichting and his daughter, Amber Altig, were partners and the principals in Alto Jake Holdings, LLC.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>\u00b64 On September 7, 2016, Landlord filed a statutory unlawful detainer action<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in the Flathead County Justice Court for repossession of both trailers, $450 in back rent, compensation for property damage, costs, and attorney fees. On October 3, 2016, Tenants filed a <em>pro se </em>answer generally denying all complaint allegations and counterclaiming for $4,800 in restitution for previously paid rent, costs, and attorney fees. In support of their counterclaim, Tenants alleged that Landlord materially breached the lease agreement by allowing the lower mobile home to become uninhabitable due to freeze-broken pipes, a defective water filtration system, and non-functional sewage system. Tenants further alleged that the upper trailer had a \u201cred tagged\u201d electrical meter while they were living there prior to moving to the lower trailer. Tenants alleged that Landlord failed to restore water and sewer service to the lower trailer despite timely written and verbal notice of the problems.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-4\">\u00b65 At bench trial on October 17,2016, Landlord presented testimony through Sichting, Altig, and hired handyman Brad Hoag. Sichting recalled the general terms of the parties\u2019 one-year lease agreement, but also testified that, due to memory loss, he could not clearly recall all related details and circumstances pertaining to the specific terms of the agreement. During the late fall and winter of 2015-16, Altig lived out-of-state and was not personally involved with the subject rental until she returned to Montana in April 2016. While Altig denied that Tenants had a one-year lease and contrarily asserted that they merely rented on an informal month-to-month basis, the Justice Court admitted a copy of the parties\u2019 executed lease agreement into evidence without objection. Altig testified that she first became aware of the water and sewer system problems in early April 2016. She asserted that the mobile home water system froze up only after Tenants unplugged the heat tape and space heater in the pump house. She also asserted that the trailers did not have a functioning water-filtration system only because Tenants removed or disconnected the system.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">\u00b66 Handyman Hoag testified that Sichting hired him to make repairs on the upper trailer in early 2016 after Tenants had moved to the lower trailer in January. Hoag testified that he was able to restore water to the upper trailer but explained that the lack of filtration caused all faucets in both trailers to plug up with sand and pebbles. Hoag said that he discovered the main sewer pipe for the lower trailer had become disconnected and that other pipes in the sewage system were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>broken, causing an unsanitary mess. Hoag testified that the lower trailer was not worth fixing due to the degree of sewage contamination. Hoag estimated that Sichting hired him to work on the two trailers approximately six times during the winter of 2016. Over objection, the Justice Court admitted a list of damages presented by Altig as Exhibit M, which estimated the total cost of repairs to the trailers at $20,583. Under questioning from the court, Tenants acknowledged that they received Landlord\u2019s notice to vacate the lower trailer in August 2016 and subsequently moved out in September 2016. Before adjourning due to time constraints on the court docket, the Justice Court declared the rental agreement terminated due to Tenants\u2019 failure to pay rent and decreed that Landlord was entitled to immediate possession of the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-4\">\u00b67 On November 18, 2016, the matter came on for continuation of bench trial to address the merits of Landlord\u2019s damages claim and Tenants\u2019 counterclaims. Tenants did not appear. On Landlord\u2019s motion, the court dismissed Tenants\u2019 counterclaims with prejudice. Amber Altig again testified that Tenants caused extraordinary damage to both trailers by causing breakage of sewer piping in the lower trailer, which then allowed raw sewage to run downhill to a small pond on the property. She estimated $4,000 as the cost of tearing down and hauling away the contaminated lower trailer and an additional $8,000 to $9,000 as the cost of digging out and restoring the contaminated pond. Based on those estimates and the other figures in her previously admitted Exhibit M, including the cost of repairing the upper trailer, Altig estimated the \u201crough total\u201d of Landlord\u2019s damages to be $20,583. At the close of trial, the Justice Court issued judgment against Tenants and awarded the Landlord damages, attorney fees, and costs in the amount of $21,950.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">\u00b68 Just hours after the trial adjourned, Tenants moved to set aside the judgment on the asserted ground that they did not receive notice of the continued trial date. On December 6, 2016, on hearing on Tenants\u2019 motion, the Justice Court vacated its November 18th judgment on the ground that Tenants had properly updated their address of record and did not receive notice at their new address.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">\u00b69 On December 7, 2016, the Justice Court issued an order, served by mail, resetting the continuation of bench trial for December 19, 2016. Four days before trial, on December 15, 2016, Tenants moved to continue the trial on the asserted grounds that: (1) they had insufficient time to prepare for trial because they did not receive notice of the December 19th trial until December 13th; (2) a Helena attorney had agreed to represent them but needed time to review the case; and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>(3) Tenant Clemm was scheduled by her new employer to begin a 7-week training at the Teletech call center in Kalispell on December 19th and would forfeit her new job if she missed the first day of training. Landlord filed a response opposing the motion and the court took no action prior to the bench trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-4\">\u00b610 On December 19,2016, the matter came on again for continuation of bench trial. Tenants both appeared. The Justice Court questioned Tenants about the status of the attorney who had purportedly agreed to represent them. Finding their explanation unsatisfactory, the court denied the motion to continue on the grounds that the attorney had yet to file a notice of appearance and that further delay would prejudice Landlord.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Upon denial of the motion, Tenants lamented that they were unsure how to proceed due to lack of sufficient time to prepare. Tenant Clemm asked the court, \u201cOkay, so can I just let you go with whatever you granted them last time? ... I am not prepared to represent myself or [Tenant Donham].\u201d The court characterized Clemm\u2019s question as a motion to vacate the continuation of bench trial and inquired of Donham whether he agreed to have the court re-impose the prior judgment. Donham agreed. The Justice Court thus stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"acq-dedup-0\">Upon the defendant\u2019s motion to vacate this trial and re-impose the judgment that was awarded to the plaintiff after the hearing on November 18th, there being no objection to it, and I find good cause for it based on the record that was made at the hearing of November 18th, the defendants\u2019 motion is granted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">The Justice Court then adjourned proceedings and re-issued its November 18th judgment, re-dated December 19, 2016, and again awarded Landlord damages, attorney fees, and costs in the total amount of $21,950.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">\u00b611 On January 18, 2017, Tenants timely filed a joint notice of appeal in the Justice Court, together with a motion and application to proceed <em>in forma pauperis. </em>By letter dated January 26, 2017, the Clerk of District Court notified the parties that the court received the Justice Court record and that the Uniform Municipal Rules of Appeal to District Court<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (U. M. C. R. App.) governed the procedure on appeal. The Clerk\u2019s notice included copies of U. M. C. R. App. 12-14 and specifically referred the parties to the \u201cdeadlines set forth in\u201d the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>attached rules. The notice warned: \u201cNo separate briefing schedule will be issued by the court.\u201d Tenants did not subsequently file an appellate brief or request an extension of their briefing deadline.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-4\">\u00b612 Almost one month later, on February 23, 2017, attorney Brian J. Miller filed a notice of appearance on Tenants\u2019 behalf in the District Court. On March 6, 2017, without reference to the previously expired briefing deadline, Tenants filed a cursory motion asking the District Court to set a briefing schedule. Later that same day, Landlord filed a motion for summary dismissal of the appeal pursuant to U. M. C. R. App. 14(c). The motion asserted that the briefing deadline specified by U. M. C. R. App. 14(a) had expired and Tenants had yet to file an appellate brief. Two days later, on March 8, 2017, the District Court summarily dismissed Tenants\u2019 appeal pursuant to U. M. C. R. App. 14(c) on the ground that, even giving them \u201cthe benefit of the doubt\u201d by \u201cadding an additional three days for mailing,\u201d Tenants\u2019 briefing deadline expired on February 13, 2017, without filing.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">\u00b613 By motion filed March 20,2017, Tenants moved the District Court to vacate its prior order of dismissal and set a new briefing schedule on the asserted grounds that: (1) the court prematurely ruled on Landlord\u2019s motion to dismiss prior to expiration of Tenants\u2019 response deadline under Uniform District Court Rule 2; (2) Tenants did not receive the court\u2019s January 26, 2017, notice of briefing deadlines until February 13, 2017, because the court incorrectly mailed the notice to Tenants\u2019 old address at 189 Kelly Road in Kalispell; and (3) Tenants requested the justice court \u201ctranscripts\u201d on February 22, 2017, but did not receive them until March 7, 2017. By response filed April 3, 2017, Landlord objected on the ground that, contrary to Tenant Donham\u2019s affidavit assertion, the Justice Court record indicated 189 Kelly Road as Donham\u2019s last address with no record indication of any other current address or request for change of address. Three days later, on April 6, 2017, Tenants filed a notice of appeal to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b466-7\">\u00b614 The district court functions as an intermediate appellate court upon an appeal from a justice court of record and the scope of district court review is \u201cconfined to review of the record and questions of law.\u201d Sections 3-5-303 and 3-10-115(1), MCA. On appeal to this Court, we review the justice court record independently of the district court as if appealed directly to this Court. <em>Stanley v. Lemire, </em>2006 MT 304, \u00b6\u00b6 25-26, 334 Mont. 489, 148 P.3d 643. Thus, we review court findings of fact for clear error, conclusions of law de novo, discretionary rulings for an abuse of discretion, and mixed questions of law and fact de novo. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>review a district court\u2019s dismissal of a lower court appeal for failure to timely prosecute the appeal for an abuse of discretion. <em>State v. Frazier, </em>2005 MT 99, \u00b6 8, 326 Mont. 524, 111 P.3d 215; \u00a7 25-33-305, MCA; U. M. C. R. App. 14(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b467-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">\u00b615 <em>1. Did the District Court erroneously dismiss Tenants\u2019 appeal for failure to timely file an appellate brief before ruling on their justice court motion to proceed in forma pauperis for purposes of\u00a7 25-33-201, MCA?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">\u00b616 Based on the assertion that \u00a7 25-33-201, MCA, first required the District Court to take notice of and rule on their still-pending justice court motion to proceed <em>in forma pauperis, </em>Tenants assert that the District Court was without jurisdiction to proceed with briefing on appeal under U. M. C. R. App. 14.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Tenants do not raise on appeal any of the asserted grounds for relief raised in their March 20,2017 motion to set aside the district court\u2019s order of dismissal.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Tenants\u2019 reliance on \u00a7 25-33-201, MCA, as the threshold jurisdictional lynchpin for their assertion of error necessarily requires analysis of the pertinent provisions of Title 25, chapter 33, MCA, and the Uniform Municipal Rules of Appeal to District Court governing appeals from justice courts of record.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-7\">\u00b617 The Flathead County Justice Court is a justice court of record, as defined by \u00a7 3-10-101(5), MCA. In contrast to appeal by trial de novo, the exclusive manner of appeal from a justice court of record is appeal on the record. Sections 3-10-115,25-33-101, and -301(3), MCA.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The U. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>M. C. R. App. and \u00a7\u00a7 25-33-101 through -306, MCA, as applicable to justice courts of record, govern the procedure on appeal from justice courts of record. <em>Frazier, </em>\u00b6 8; \u00a7\u00a7 3-10-115(4) and 25-33-101, MCA. Regardless of whether a justice court is a court of record, a party seeking to appeal an adverse judgment in a civil case must first file a notice of appeal in justice court within 30 days of entry of the judgment. U. M. C. R. App. 4, 5(a)(1); \u00a7\u00a7 25-33-101 through -103, MCA. When the judgment is a money judgment, the appeal \u201cis not effectual for any purpose unless\u201d the appellant also files \u201can undertaking\u201d with two or more sureties, in a sum equal to twice the amount of the judgment, including costs. U. M. C. R. App. 5(a)(2), 6(a)(1) and (4); \u00a7\u00a7 25-33-201(1) and (4), MCA.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> At the time of filing the notice of appeal, the appellant must pay a justice court filing fee for the notice of appeal and undertaking, verification of sureties, and transmittal of the justice record to district court. Section 25-31-112(5), MCA. However, a person unable to pay the filing fee or cost of the undertaking may file a motion injustice court to proceed <em>informa pauperis. </em>U. M. C. R. App. 6(a)(1) and (4), 11(a); \u00a7\u00a7 25-10-404(1), 25-31-113, and 25-33-201(1), (5), MCA. A motion to proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>is a request for waiver of filing fees, the undertaking requirement, and costs on appeal in the form of an affidavit stating that the appellant has a non-frivolous appeal and is unable to afford those costs. U. M. C. R. App. 11(a); \u00a7 25-10-404(1), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-4\">\u00b618 If the justice of the peace is available and grants the waiver request upon timely presentation of a notice of appeal, the justice court must file the notice of appeal and the appeal must proceed as if the appellant had paid the justice court filing fee and filed the required undertaking. U. M. C. R. App. 6(a)(1), 11(a); \u00a7 25-10-404(1) and (2), MCA; <em>see also </em>\u00a7\u00a7 25-31-113 and 25-33-201(1), MCA. If the justice of the peace is not available to rule on the waiver, the justice court must likewise file the notice of appeal and, \u201csubject to subsequent approval\u201d of the waiver request by the district court, the appeal must proceed as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>if the appellant had paid the justice court filing fee and filed the required undertaking. Section 25-10-404(2), MCA; <em>see also </em>U. M. C. R. App. 6(a)(1) and (4); \u00a7\u00a7 25-31-113, and 25-33-201(1), (5), MCA.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> If the justice of the peace denies the waiver request on an appeal from a justice court of record, the appellant must either pay the justice court filing fee and file the required undertaking or refile the waiver motion in district court within 10 days of the denial. U. M. C. R. App. 11.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A6g\">\u00b619 Given the particular and limited jurisdiction of justice courts and the limited appellate jurisdiction of district courts, we have long held that strict compliance with the statutory notice of appeal and undertaking requirements are necessary to vest the district court with appellate jurisdiction in each case. <em>Berry v. Seman, </em>245 Mont. 335, 337, 801 P.2d 589, 590 (1990); <em>Adams v. Crismore, </em>211 Mont. 245, 248-49, 683 P.2d 497, 499 (1984); <em>State ex rel. Gregory v. District Court, </em>86 Mont. 396, 398, 284 P. 537, 537-38 (1930); <em>Jenkins v. Carroll, </em>42 Mont. 302, 313, 112 P. 1064, 1069 (1910) <em>(citing McCauley v. Jones, </em>35 Mont. 32, 88 P. 572 (1907)); and <em>State ex rel. Hall v. District Court, </em>34 Mont. 112, 85 P. 872 (1906)). Based on this jurisdictional threshold, record and non-record justice courts have no duty to transmit the record on appeal to district court unless and until the appellant perfects the appeal by timely complying with the notice of appeal and undertaking requirements of U. M. C. R. App. 4, 5(a)(1), 6(a)(1); \u00a7\u00a7 25-33-101 through -103, and -201(1), MCA. U. M. C. R. App. 10(a) and (c); \u00a7 25-33-104, MCA. Consequently, jurisdiction over an appeal generally does not vest in the district court until the justice court transmits the justice court record upon perfection of the appeal injustice court. <em>See </em>U. M. C. R. App. 10(c), (h), and 14(a); \u00a7 25-33-104, MCA; <em>Berry, </em>245 Mont. at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>337, 801 P.2d at 590.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The dispositive issue here is whether, and to what extent, the timely filing of a motion to proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>satisfies the undertaking requirements of U. M. C. R. App. 6 and \u00a7 25-33-201, MCA, sufficient to vest the district court with jurisdiction over an appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-4\">\u00b620 In that regard, Tenants timely filed a notice of appeal, and accompanying motion to proceed <em>in forma pauperis, </em>in justice court in accordance with U. M. C. R. App. 4, 5(a)(1), and 6(a)(1); \u00a7\u00a7 25-10-404(1), 25-31-113, 25-33-101 through -103, -201(1), (5), MCA. The justice court timely transmitted the record to the district court \u201csubject to subsequent approval\u201d of the fee waiver request. U. M. C. R. App. 6(a)(1) and (4), 10(a) and (c); \u00a7\u00a7 25-10-404(2), 25-31-113, and 25-33-201(1), (4), MCA. Thus, subject to subsequent approval of Tenants\u2019 fee waiver request pursuant to \u00a7 25-10-404(2), MCA, the district court acquired jurisdiction over the appeal on January 24, 2017, on receipt and filing of the justice court record. U. M. C. R. App. 10(c) and (h); \u00a7 25-33-104, MCA; <em>Berry, </em>245 Mont. at 337, 801 P.2d at 590.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">\u00b621 The clerk of district court \u201cshall notify the parties in writing\u201d of the filing date of the justice record. U. M. C. R. App. 10(c). The clerk may serve the notice by mail or personal service. U. M. C. R. App. 12(c). \u201cService by mail is complete on mailing.\u201d U. M. C. R. App. 12(c). Unless otherwise ordered by the district court, \u201cthe appellant shall serve and file a brief within 15 days after the date on which the record is filed.\u201d U. M. C. R. App. 14(a). If the clerk serves notice of filing of the justice court record to the parties by mail, the filing deadline for the appellant\u2019s brief is 18 days after the date of filing of the justice court record in district court. U. M. C. R. App. 14(a), 20(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">\u00b622 Here, the District Court received and filed the justice record on appeal on January 24, 2017. By correspondence mailed two days later to the parties\u2019 respective addresses of record in the justice court record, the Clerk of District Court notified the parties in writing of the court\u2019s receipt of the justice court record and that the U. M. C. R. App. governed the procedure on appeal. The notice included copies of U. M. C. R. App. 12-14 (requirements for filing, service, and form of briefs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>and briefing deadlines) and referred the parties to the \u201cdeadlines set forth in\u201d the attached rules. The notice clearly and unequivocally warned that: \u201cNo separate briefing schedule will be issued by the court.\u201d The clerk\u2019s notice of the filing date of the record and the parties\u2019 briefing deadlines was clear, unequivocal, and complete on mailing.</p>\n<p id=\"Ann\">\u00b623 \u201cIf [the] appellant fails to file a brief within the time provided\u201d by Rule 14(a) or as otherwise extended by the court, \u201cthe appeal shall be deemed without merit and subject to summary dismissal by the district court.\u201d U. M. C. R. App. 14(c). Absent an abuse of discretion, \u201cwe will not reverse a district court for insisting that the parties ... timely comply\u201d with the briefing deadlines specified by U. M. C. R. App. 14(a). <em>Frazier, </em>\u00b6 9. Despite due notice of the filing deadline mailed to their last address of record, Tenants\u2019 neither filed a brief nor requested a time extension upon a showing of good cause. Well after expiration of the briefing deadline, when Tenants appeared through new counsel on February 23, 2017, Tenants again failed to file a brief or seek a time extension. Even when counsel subsequently filed a motion requesting a briefing schedule on March 6, 2017, the motion made no reference to the expired briefing deadline, much less an asserted showing of good cause for a belated time extension. Though Tenants subsequently attempted to assert good cause for not complying with their briefing deadline in their March 20, 2017 motion to set aside the court\u2019s order of dismissal, Tenants do not appeal on any of those grounds here.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Under these circumstances, Tenants have failed to show that the District Court abused its discretion in summarily dismissing the appeal pursuant U. M. C. R. App. 14(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b471-4\">\u00b624 In reliance on <em>Dime Ins. Agency v. Johnson &amp; ISC Distributors, </em>279 Mont. 121, 926 P.2d 733 (1996), Tenants assert that, regardless of an otherwise valid basis for dismissal pursuant to U. M. C. R. App. 14(c), the district court did not have jurisdiction over the appeal, and thus the U. M. C. R. App. 14(a) briefing deadline could not begin to run, until the court ruled on Tenants\u2019 previously filed fee waiver request. In <em>Dime Ins., </em>we considered whether an appellant\u2019s failure to file an undertaking within 30 days of the date of the justice court judgment prevented the district court from acquiring jurisdiction to proceed to on appeal. <em>Dime Ins., </em>279 Mont. at 123-24, 926 P.2d at 734-35. While recognizing the long-settled rule that the district court does <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>not acquire jurisdiction over an appeal unless and until the appellant has complied with the statutory notice of appeal and undertaking requirements, we held only that, read to together in context, \u00a7\u00a7 25-33-103, -201, and -207, MCA, allowed the appellant to file the required undertaking at any time prior to the hearing on a motion to dismiss filed by the appellee in district court. <em>Dime Ins., </em>279 Mont. at 126-27, 926 P.2d at 736-37.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Unlike here, <em>Dime Ins. </em>did not consider the effect of the continued pendency of a justice court motion to proceed <em>informa pauperis </em>on the district court\u2019s acquisition of jurisdiction over an appeal. Thus, <em>Dime </em>is distinguishable and of no consequence here.</p>\n<p id=\"AYg\">\u00b625  Nonetheless, we again recognize and reaffirm the longstanding general rule that the district court does not acquire jurisdiction to proceed with an appeal unless and until an appellant timely complies with the statutory requirements for filing a notice of appeal and an undertaking on appeal. However, the undertaking requirement is expressly subject to an indigency-based waiver. U. M. C. R. App. 6(a)(1) and (4); \u00a7 25-33-201(1), (5), MCA. Moreover, if the justice court is unable to timely rule on a motion to proceed <em>in forma pauperis, </em>the appeal must proceed as if the appellant had timely paid required fees and filed the required undertaking \u201csubject to subsequent approval\u201d of the appellant\u2019s fee waiver request by the district court. <em>See </em>\u00a7 25-10-404(1), (2), MCA; <em>see also </em>U. M. C. R. App. 6(a)(4); \u00a7 25-33-201(5), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"AuN-\">\u00b626  In accordance with \u00a7 25-10-404(1) and (2), MCA, and in the current absence of a more specific statutory or rule provision to the contrary, a district court\u2019s failure to rule <em>sua sponte </em>on a pending waiver request previously filed in justice court does not preclude acquisition or retention of district court jurisdiction to proceed with briefing on appeal upon transmittal of the justice court record. Rather, pursuant to \u00a7 25-10-404(1) and (2), MCA, the district court acquires jurisdiction on transmittal of the justice court record and may proceed on appeal subject to subsequent ruling on the pending waiver request prior to entry of final judgment on appeal. Upon acquisition of jurisdiction on filing of the justice court record, the district court may rule on the pending indigency waiver request: (1) on motion of the adverse party pursuant to \u00a7 25-33-207, MCA; (2) on the appellant\u2019s renewed motion or request for ruling pursuant U. M. C. R. App. 6(a)(4) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>and 11(b) and \u00a7 25-10-404(1) and (2), MCA; or (3) <em>sua sponte. </em>Here, pursuant to U. M. C. R. App. 6(a)(1) and (4) and \u00a7\u00a7 25-10-404(1), (2) and 25-33-201(1), (4), MCA, the district court acquired jurisdiction over the appeal on filing of the justice court record subject to subsequent approval of the pending waiver request prior to entry of final judgment on appeal. Landlord, the only party with standing to contest Tenants\u2019 request for waiver of the undertaking requirement, did not object to the request prior to entry of final judgment on appeal. Thus, regardless of the continued pendency of Tenants\u2019justice court motion to proceed <em>in forma pauperis, </em>the District Court had jurisdiction to proceed with briefing on appeal pursuant to U. M. C. R. App. 14. We hold that the District Court did not err, due to lack of jurisdiction, in dismissing Tenants\u2019 appeal pursuant to U. M. C. R. App. 14(c) prior to ruling on their previously filed motion to proceed <em>in forma pauperis.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b473-4\">\u00b627 <em>2. Did the Justice Court erroneously enter a money judgment in excess of its $12,000jurisdictional limit </em>?</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">\u00b628 Tenants did not object here or below that the amount of the Justice Court judgment exceeded the jurisdictional limit for justice courts. However, subject matter jurisdiction is the threshold power and authority of a court to hear and determine a claim or issue. <em>Ballas v. Missoula City Bd. of Adjustment, </em>2007 MT 299, \u00b6\u00b6 15-16, 340 Mont. 56, 172 P.3d 1232 (distinguishing subject matter jurisdiction from standing); <em>Stanley, </em>\u00b6 30. Montana courts acquire jurisdiction only as conferred by the Montana Constitution or statutes enacted in conformance with the Constitution. <em>Stanley, </em>\u00b6 52. While the failure to timely object generally waives non-jurisdictional procedural defects, \u201clack of subject matter jurisdiction cannot be waived, and may be raised at any stage of a judicial proceeding by a party or sua sponte\u201d by the trial or appellate court. <em>Stanley, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 31-32 (courts cannot acquire subject matter jurisdiction by consent of the parties and trial and appellate courts have an independent duty \u201cto determine whether subject-matter jurisdiction exists\u201d <em>sua sponte); Sage v. Gamble, </em>279 Mont. 459, 463, 929 P.2d 822, 824 (1996) (lack of subject matter jurisdiction cannot be waived); <em>O\u2019Donnell v. Ryans, Inc., </em>227 Mont. 48, 49, 736 P.2d 965, 966 (1987). Accordingly, we review <em>sua sponte </em>on appeal in this matter whether the amount of the Justice Court judgment exceeded the jurisdictional limit for justice court money damages awards.</p>\n<p id=\"AJR\">\u00b629  As courts of limited jurisdiction strictly prescribed by statute, justice courts have no jurisdiction in civil actions to award money damages in excess of $12,000, exclusive of courts costs and attorney fees. Section 3-10-301, MCA. The jurisdictional limits specified by \u00a7 3-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>10-301, MCA, are express limits on the subject matter jurisdiction of justice courts. Here, based on the evidence of the \u201crough total\u201d of damages claimed by the Landlord, the Justice Court awarded $20,524 to Alto Jake Holdings, LLC, exclusive of costs and attorney fees. Adding in claimed costs and statutory attorney fees in the amount of $1,426, the Justice Court issued judgment against Tenants in the total amount of $21,950. The $20,524 compensatory damages award exceeded the Justice Court\u2019s $12,000 jurisdictional limit by $8,524. Thus, regardless of Tenants\u2019 lack of objection below or on appeal to this Court, the Justice Court erred by awarding a money judgment $8,524 in excess of its $12,000 jurisdictional limit.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">\u00b630 We hold that the District Court did not err, due to lack of jurisdiction, in dismissing Tenants\u2019 appeal pursuant to U. M. C. R. App. 14(c) prior to ruling on their previously filed motion to proceed <em>in forma pauperis. </em>However, we hold that the Justice Court erred by awarding a money judgment $8,524 in excess of the court\u2019s $12,000 jurisdictional limit. Therefore, we hereby reverse and remand for entry of a corrected judgment against Tenants in the total amount of $13,426, constituting $12,000 in compensatory damages and $1,426 in costs and attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">\u00b631 Affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b474-7\">JUSTICES SHEA, WHEAT, McKINNON and RICE concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b463-6\"><em> See </em>\u00a7\u00a7 70-27-108 through -212, MCA.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b465-7\"> The Justice Court made no findings as to the nature of the prejudice.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b465-8\"> Enacted by Sup.
