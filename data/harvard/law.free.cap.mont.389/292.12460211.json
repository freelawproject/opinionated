Watson (\u201cWatson\u201d) appeals the January 25,2017 Order by the Eighth Judicial District Court, Cascade County, granting Defendant Burlington Northern and Sante Fe Railway Company\u2019s (\u201cBNSF\u201d) motion for summary judgment on Watson\u2019s asbestos-related disease claim, brought under the Federal Employers\u2019 Liability Act (\u201cFELA\u201d). The dispositive issue in this matter is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-10\">\n<em>Whether the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s Order enjoining claims against W.R. Grace and other \u201cAffiliated Entities,\u201d including BNSF, tolled the statute of limitations on Watson\u2019s claim.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b319-13\">\u00b62 We reverse and remand for further proceedings consistent with this Opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-14\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b319-15\">\u00b63 Watson was a long-term employee of BNSF in Lincoln County. During his BNSF employment, he was exposed to vermiculite dust. The vermiculite mined in Libby and the dust produced by it contains amphibole asbestos. BNSF transported vermiculite for W.R. Grace &amp; Company and its predecessors from Libby to various locations.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-16\">\u00b64 In July 2000, following widespread news reports on the hazards posed by vermiculite dust from the W.R. Grace mine in Libby, Watson sought a health screening offered by the Libby Community Environmental Health Program. Watson\u2019s initial test results for lung disease were negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-17\">\u00b65 On April 2, 2001, W.R. Grace filed a voluntary petition for relief under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code in U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware. The Bankruptcy Court immediately entered a temporary restraining order (\u201cTRO\u201d) against actions being pursued against Non debtor Affiliates and certain third parties arising from W.R. Grace\u2019s mining operations and exposure to vermiculite dust. The TRO defined \u201cActions\u201d as \u201cpending actions and actions that have not been filed or are not pending as of the date of entry of this Order ....\u201d It also ordered \u201cthat the prosecution and/or commencement of all Actions are temporarily restrained pending a resolution of [W.R. Grace I\u2019s pending motions for a preliminary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>injunction ....\u201d On April 12, 2001, the Bankruptcy Court extended the TRO, again defining \u201cActions\u201d as \u201cpending actions and actions that have not been filed or are not pending as of the date of entry of this Order[,]\u201d and ordered that the \u201cOrder GrantingTemporary Restraining Order entered on April 2,2001 temporarily restraining the prosecution and/or commencement of all Actions pending a resolution of plaintiffs pending motions for a preliminary injunction is hereby extended through and including April 24, 2001 ....\u201d On April 18, 2001, the Bankruptcy Court entered a preliminary injunction pending a May 3, 2001 hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">\u00b66 On May 3, 2001, the Bankruptcy Court entered a Preliminary Injunction, which ordered \u201cthat the prosecution of all Actions are stayed and enjoined pending a final judgment in this adversary proceeding or further order of this Court ....\u201d The Injunction again defined \u201cActions\u201d as \u201cany case filed or pending,\u201d but omitted the previously used language, \u201cand actions that have not been filed or are not pending.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">\u00b67 On January 22, 2002, the Bankruptcy Court modified the May 3, 2001 Order. The January 22, 2002 Order \u201creinstate^] the bar against the commencement of new Actions against Affiliated Entities.\u201d The January 22, 2002 Order also restored the language that had been omitted from the May 3, 2001 Order, so that the definition of \u201cActions\u201d again included \u201cactions that have not been filed or are not pending....\u201d The Order stayed and enjoined the prosecution of \u201call Actions as defined above.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b320-7\">\u00b68 On March 26, 2007, W.R. Grace moved to expand the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s Injunction to include actions against BNSF related to W.R. Grace\u2019s Libby mining operations. On June 6, 2007, the Bankruptcy Court entered a temporary order staying cases against BNSF while it considered expanding the Injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-8\">\u00b69 Meanwhile, Watson underwent a second health screening in October 2007. On October 22,2007, a physician advised Watson he had asbestos-related disease associated with his exposure while working for BNSF.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-9\">\u00b610 On April 11, 2008, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order expanding the Injunction to include BNSF as a Nondebtor Affiliate. The Order reads, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-10\">The matter before the Court is the Debtors\u2019 Motion to Expand the Preliminary Injunction to Include Actions Against [BNSF] (the \u201cExpansion Motion\u201d), <em>which seeks to expand the relief granted by the preliminary injunction (the \u201cInjunction\u201d) to specifically include actions against [BNSF] </em>for exposure of some kind to the Debtors\u2019 former vermiculite mining operations in Libby, Montana (the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>\u201cMontana Actions\u201d).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"pAaK\">\n<img class=\"blockquote\" height=\"29\" src=\"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAQgAAAAdAQAAAAB+4c/OAAAASUlEQVR4nGP8z0AAMBFSMKpikKs4AaX/O0AZP9FV7IHS/x5AGT8aiLaF4T8EHIfS/+yhjB9Q+j/MDA0ozQhzByvMCMbRVEh1FQDvJymU+1VsBAAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==\" width=\"264\"/>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-5\">The preliminary injunction at issue in this proceeding was issued on May 3, 2001, barring the prosecution of currently pending actions against various affiliated entities and third parties whose purported liability was solely derivative of W.R. Grace. After May 3,2001, the preliminary injunction was extended. <em>On January 22, 2002, the court entered an order modifying the preliminary injunction </em>to include certain additional affiliates and <em>to reinstate the bar against the commencement of new actions against affiliates arising from alleged exposure to asbestos whether indirectly or directly causefd] by W.R.

Watson\u2019s complaint contains no allegations against BNSF; neither Watson\u2019s employment nor BNSF is referenced in the pleading.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-9\">\u00b612 On February 3, 2014, under the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s Order, W.R. Grace\u2019s reorganization plan became effective and the automatic stays and injunctions, including actions against BNSF, terminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-10\">\u00b613 On November 28, 2014, Watson moved to amend his complaint to remove settled claims against the State, dismiss claims against the wood products defendants and Montana Light and Power Co., and add claims against BNSF. On December 2, 2014, Watson filed his First <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>Amended Complaint and Demand for Jury Trial. He alleged that he was exposed to vermiculite dust during his employment with BNSF, which transported vermiculite for the W.R. Grace &amp; Company and its predecessors from Libby to various locations.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">\u00b614 On January 25, 2017, the District Court granted BNSF\u2019s motion for summary judgment. The District Court held the statute of limitations barred Watson\u2019s claim because Watson\u2019s claim accrued on October 22,2007, and he should have filed his FELA claims by October 22, 2010. The District Court concluded that \u201c[wjhile the bankruptcy court\u2019s injunction stayed pending cases against BNSF, nothing in the injunction prohibited a plaintiff from suing,\u201d and \u201c[tjhere is nothing in the original bankruptcy court injunction, BNSF expanded injunction, or associated briefing referenced by the parties that precludes filing new cases to preserve the statute of limitations.\u201d The District Court also concluded that \u201cthere is nothing in the plain language of the bankruptcy court\u2019s original injunction or expanded BNSF injunction that enjoins the \u2018commencement of an action\u2019 to trigger \u00a7 27-2-406, MCA.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b322-7\">\u00b615 We review de novo a district court\u2019s grant or denial of summary judgment, applying the same criteria of M. R. Civ. P. 56 as a district court. <em>Anderson v. BNSF Railway, </em>2015 MT 240, \u00b6 15, 380 Mont. 319, 354 P.3d 1248. Summary judgment is appropriate when the moving party demonstrates both the absence of any genuine issues of material fact and entitlement to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Anderson, </em>\u00b6 15. Once the moving party has met its burden, the non-moving party must present substantial evidence essential to one or more elements of the case to raise a genuine issue of material fact. <em>Anderson, </em>\u00b6 15. We review a question of law to determine if the district court\u2019s legal conclusions are correct. <em>Anderson, </em>\u00b6 15 <em>(citing Harris v. State, </em>2013 MT 16, \u00b6 11, 368 Mont. 276, 294 P.3d 382).</p>\n<p id=\"b322-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b322-9\">\u00b616 <em>Whether the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s Order enjoining claims against W.R. Grace and other \u2018Affiliated Entities,\u201d including BNSF, tolled the statute of limitations on Watson\u2019s claim.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b322-10\">\u00b617 No action may be maintained under the FELA unless commenced <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>within three years from the day the cause of action accrued. 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 56. Section 27-2-406, MCA, provides: \u201cWhen the commencement of an action is stayed by injunction or other order of the court or judge or statutory prohibition, the time of the continuance of the injunction or prohibition is not part of the time limited for the commencement of the action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">\u00b618 Watson argues the period of limitations for his action against BNSF should be deemed tolled because the commencement of an action against BNSF was enjoined by the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s Injunction and \u00a7 27-2-406, MCA, applies. Watson asserts the District Court erroneously concluded that the Bankruptcy Court Injunction did not bar the \u201ccommencement\u201d of a new action, such as Watson\u2019s, because: (a) the Injunction was modified on January 22, 2002, to \u201creinstate the bar against the commencement of actions\u201d; (b) the Injunction was expanded to bar not only certain \u201cMontana Actions\u201d but \u201call other similar actions that have been or may be filed\u201d against BNSF; (c) the purpose of expanding the Injunction to include BNSF was to prevent the tender of defense to Debtor W.R. Grace that would be triggered by the filing of a complaint against BNSF; and (d) the Bankruptcy Court and the parties, including BNSF, repeatedly acknowledged the Injunction as a bar against the \u201ccommencement\u201d of actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">\u00b619 BNSF argues the latest date on which Watson\u2019s claim accrued was October 22, 2007, but because Watson did not file until December 2014, the District Court\u2019s grant of summary judgment was proper. BNSF maintains the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s Injunction merely stayed the prosecution and litigation involving claims against BNSF arising out of W.R. Grace\u2019s mining operations in Libby, and did not bar the commencement or filing of new claims against BNSF or toll the limitations period. BNSF contends the District Court appropriately determined that nothing in the plain language of the Injunction barred the commencement of new cases against BNSF while the Injunction was in place. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-7\">\u00b620 The District Court\u2019s Order failed to acknowledge the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s January 22, 2002 Order that modified the May 3, 2001 Injunction for the express purpose of \u201creinstatfing] the bar against the commencement of new actions against Affiliated Entities.\u201d Furthermore, the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s April 11, 2008 Order that expanded the Injunction to include actions against BNSF specifically noted that the original Injunction was modified by the January 22, 2002 Order \u201cto reinstate the bar against the commencement of new actions against affiliates arising from alleged exposure to asbestos whether indirectly or directly cause by W.R. Grace.\u201d The April 11, 2008 Order concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>It is further ORDERED, ADJUDGED, and DECREED that <em>the Injunction, as defined in the foregoing Memorandum Opinion, </em>is hereby expanded to include BNSF as a Nondebtor Affiliate and that the Montana Actions and all other similar actions that have been or may be brought against BNSF that arise from alleged exposure to vermiculite ore from the Debtors\u2019 Libby mining operations are and shall be stayed until further order of the Court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"agy-dedup-0\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"axn-dedup-0\">\u00b621  Watson\u2019s claim accrued in October 2007. While his claim was still well within the FELA\u2019s three-year statute of limitations, the Bankruptcy Court issued its April 22, 2008 Order expanding the Injunction to include BNSF as a Nondebtor Affiliate. This Injunction, as modified by the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s January 22, 2002 Order, \u201cbar[red] ... the commencement of new actions against affiliates.\u201d Effective upon the issuance of the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s April 22, 2008 Order, therefore, Watson was barred from commencing his asbestos-related disease action against BNSF. The Bankruptcy Court\u2019s Injunction was lifted on February 3, 2014, at which time Watson\u2019s statute of limitations resumed running. Watson amended his Complaint to include BNSF on November 28, 2014. Approximately six months passed between October 22,2007, when Watson\u2019s claim against BNSF accrued, to April 11, 2008, when the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s Injunction was expanded to include BNSF. Approximately ten months passed between February 3, 2014, when the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s Injunction was lifted, until November 28, 2014, when Watson amended his Complaint to include BNSF. After excluding the time that Watson was enjoined from commencing an action against BNSF, he amended his Complaint to include a claim against BNSF approximately sixteen months after his claim accrued. This was well within the FELA\u2019s three-year statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b324-7\">\u00b622  The District Court erred in its conclusion that the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s Injunction did not bar the commencement of new actions against BNSF. We reverse the District Court\u2019s order granting summary judgment to BNSF and remand to the District Court for further proceedings consistent with this Opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b324-8\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES SANDEFUR, BAKER and RICE concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b322-11\"> Section 27-2-406, MCA, tolls a limitations period \u201c[w]hen the commencement of an action is stayed by injunction or other order of the court or judge or statutory prohibition.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
