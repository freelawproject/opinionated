Davis (Davises) appeal from an order of the Montana Eleventh Judicial District Court, Flathead County, denying the portion of their motion for partial summary judgment seeking an order compelling Defendants Douglas L. Westphal and Kathy L. Wilson (Westphals) to immediately remove trespassing encroachments on Davises\u2019 property and to restore the property to its prior condition subject to Davises\u2019 right to do so at Westphals\u2019 expense if they fail to timely act. Westphals cross-appeal the District Court\u2019s underlying grant of summary judgment declaring their shop building and underground septic system to be trespassing encroachments on Davises\u2019 property. We affirm and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-10\">ISSUE</p>\n<p id=\"b279-11\">\u00b62 The restated issue is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-12\">\n<em>Did the District Court erroneously deny summary judgment for immediate removal of Westphals\u2019 trespassing encroachments and restoration of Davises\u2019 land?</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b279-13\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b279-14\">\u00b63 The parties are owners of adjoining tracts of rural property along Five Deer Lane in Flathead County near Bigfork, Montana. The Westphals own a 10.01-acre tract to the west known as Five Deer Lakes Lot 1. The Davises own an 8.562 tract to the east known as Five Deer Lakes Lot 2. Without verification or inquiry, the Westphals mistakenly assumed that a line of pink survey flags running across the ground from a corner survey marker delineated the boundary line between Lots 1 and 2. As a result, Westphals cut down several trees on Davises\u2019 property in 2013. In 2014-15, Westphals built a 40\u2019x60\u2019 shop building, and installed an accompanying septic system drain field, near their property line, both which mistakenly encroached on Davises\u2019 property.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-15\">\u00b64 In September 2015, while visiting their undeveloped land from California, Davises first noticed the Westphals\u2019 progressing improvements and suspected that they encroached on Davises\u2019 land. By that time, the septic system drain field and concrete foundation for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>shop were in place and Westphals were in the process of erecting the metal shop building on the foundation. After retaining a licensed surveyor and confirming that the shop building and drain field encroached across the property line onto their lot, Davises notified Westphals of the encroachments and requested that they remove them immediately. Westphals did not immediately respond. After they finished enclosing the shop in advance of the oncoming winter, Westphals responded, by correspondence dated November 13, 2015, wherein they acknowledged the encroachments, admitted fault for their mistake, apologized, and stated their desire to resolve the problem amicably.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">\u00b65 Six months later, with no agreement or abatement effort underway or imminent, the Davises filed a district court complaint on June 10, 2016, asserting four unspecified causes of action seeking: (1) \u201can order of ejectment, deconstruction and removal of\u2019 the \u201cencroachments, and reasonable restoration of [the] property;\u201d (2) compensatory damages, trebled by statute, for the wrongfully felled trees; (3) relocation of the non-encroaching portions of the shop and septic system in compliance with county zoning setback requirements; and (4) punitive damages. The complaint separately prayed for judgment declaring the encroachments as trespasses, \u201cejecting\u201d the encroachments, \u201cordering [their] immediate deconstruction and removal,\u201d ordering restoration of the property, \u201cenjoining [Westphals] from constructing any improvements on their own property in violation of ... zoning ... setback requirements;\u201d and for compensatory and punitive damages \u201cproximately caused by [Westphals\u2019] conduct.\u201d The District Court issued a temporary restraining order on Davises\u2019 accompanying ex parte motion and set a hearing on their motion for a preliminary injunction for June 22, 2016. At the hearing, upon notice that the parties had reached an informal agreement for Westphals to remove the encroachments and restore the property in return for the Davises dropping their request for a preliminary injunction, the District Court denied the motion for preliminary injunction as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"Alt\">\u00b66 On September 12,2016, with abatement of the encroachments still not underway or imminent, Davises moved for summary judgment for: (1) declaratory judgment declaring the encroachments as trespasses on their property; (2) an order \u201cejecting\u201d the encroachments and \u201cordering [their] immediate ... removal\u201d with restoration of the property; (3) \u201ca permanent injunction\u201d enjoining \u201cany further trespass\u201d and enjoining Westphals from \u201cconstructing any improvements on their own property in violation of\u2019 county \u201czoning regulations or setback requirements.\u201d For the first time and without reference to mandatory injunctive relief, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>Davises characterized their claims as claims for declaratory judgment of trespass, common law \u201cejectment,\u201d and prohibitive injunctive relief. Westphals opposed the motion on the asserted ground that no legal trespass had occurred because they had not intentionally encroached on Davises\u2019 property. Westphals requested an additional year to remove the encroachments and restore the property in the face of the upcoming winter. Westphals filed a supporting affidavit describing the difficulty and cost of removing the encroachments and restoring the property. The affidavit described the Westphals\u2019 financial limitations and asserted that Davises\u2019 need for immediate abatement was not urgent because they lived in California, only occasionally visited the land, and had no immediate plans to build on the undeveloped property.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">\u00b67 On October 24, 2016, the District Court granted Davises\u2019 summary judgment on the briefs without a hearing<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> declaring that the Westphal encroachments and tree-felling constituted civil trespasses. However, the court denied Davises\u2019 requests for \u201cimmediate ejection... and removal of all encroaching improvements,\u201d site restoration, and a permanent injunction enjoining any further intrusion on Davises\u2019 property or noncompliance with county zoning setback requirements. The court reasoned that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-6\">(1) the authority cited by Davises did not \u201corder ejection, adopt the remedy of ejection, or otherwise establish standards for an ejection claim;\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-7\">(2) \u00a7 27-1-318, MCA, \u201cgenerally provides for money damages for wrongful occupation of real property;\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-8\">(3) though \u201cejection is a possible remedy\u201d under \u00a7 27-8-313, MCA (declaratory judgment supplemental relief provision), and <em>Goodover v. Lindey\u2019s, </em>246 Mont. 80, 802 P.2d 1258 (1980) (affirming discretionary grant of supplemental mandatory injunction for removal of encroachments to afford complete relief to declaratory judgment of trespass), Davises presented \u201cinsufficient information to determine whether coercive supplemental relief, i.e., ejection, deconstruction, and restoration,\u201d is necessary <em>\u201cas a matter of law\u201d </em>to remedy the trespasses \u201cin addition to money damages\u201d (emphasis in original); and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-9\">(4) Davises \u201coffered no factual basis or legal argument that [the requested prohibitive] injunctive relief is necessary at this point <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>in time.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">The court noted further that Westphals \u201cinformally agreed to remove the encroaching structures in exchange for dismissal of the action,\u201d a result the court observed to be \u201cthe most expeditious way to resolve the dispute.\u201d The court thus encouraged the parties \u201cto negotiate a date certain for removal of the structures.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">\u00b68 Davises subsequently moved the District Court pursuant to M. R. Civ. P. 59(e) and 60(a) to \u201ccorrect\u201d its summary judgment ruling by granting their request for an order compelling immediate removal of the encroachments and site restoration on the asserted ground that the failure to grant such relief was irreconcilably inconsistent with its declaration of trespass and erroneously failed to provide complete relief. The District Court denied the motion on the stated ground that its denial of mandatory injunctive relief was not a final judgment and that Davises \u201cfailed to raise any new evidence\u201d or show that the denial was erroneous as a matter of law. Davises appeal the court\u2019s denial of their request for an order compelling immediate removal of the encroachments and site restoration.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Westphals cross-appeal the court\u2019s underlying declaratory judgment of trespass.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-7\">STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b282-8\">\u00b69 We review summary judgment rulings de novo for conformance to M. R. Civ. P. 56. <em>Dick Anderson Constr., Inc. v. Monroe Prop. Co., </em>2011 MT 138, \u00b6 16, 361 Mont. 30, 255 P.3d 1257. Summary judgment is proper only when there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. M. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(3). The questions of whether a genuine issue of material fact exists or whether a party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law are conclusions of law subject to de novo review for correctness. <em>Ereth v. Cascade County, </em>2003 MT 328, \u00b6 11, 318 Mont. 355, 81 P.3d 463.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-9\">\u00b610 The grant or denial of injunctive relief is a matter within the broad discretion of the district court based on applicable findings of fact and conclusions of law. <em>Shammel v. Canyon Resources Corp., </em>2003 MT 372, \u00b6 11, 319 Mont. 132, 82 P.3d 912; <em>Walker v. Warner, </em>228 Mont. 162, 166, 740 P.2d 1147, 1149-50 (1987). The standard of review of a grant or denial of injunctive relief is whether the court manifestly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>abused its discretion. <em>Shammel, </em>\u00b6 12. A manifest abuse of discretion is an \u201cobvious, evident, or unmistakable\u201d abuse of discretion. <em>Shammel, </em>\u00b6 12. The standard of review of lower court findings of fact and conclusions of law is whether the findings of fact are clearly erroneous and whether the conclusions of law are correct. We review district court rulings on motions for post-judgment relief under M. R. Civ. P. 59 and 60 for an abuse of discretion. <em>Folsom v. Montana Pub. Employees Ass\u2019n, </em>2017 MT 204, \u00b6 18, 388 Mont. 307, 400 P.3d 706.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">\u00b611 At issue on Davises\u2019 appeal and Westphals\u2019 cross-appeal are summary judgment rulings that are also the predicate for Davises\u2019 related appeal of the court\u2019s subsequent denial of their <em>Motion to Correct </em>summary judgment rulings. Orders granting or denying summary judgment are generally interlocutory orders not subject to immediate appeal. <em>Trombley v. Mann, </em>2001 MT 154, \u00b6\u00b6 6-10, 306 Mont. 80, 30 P.3d 355; M. R. App. P. 6(5)(b). In this case, the District Court has not entered a \u201cfinal judgment,\u201d as defined by M. R. App. P. 4(1)(a), or certified its interlocutory summary judgment rulings as suitable for immediate appeal pursuant to M. R. Civ. P. 54(b) and M. R. App. P. 6(6). However, \u201cprovided that the order is the court\u2019s final decision on the referenced matter,\u201d orders granting or denying injunctive relief are immediately appealable. M. R. App. P. 6(3)(e). Rule 6(3)(e) thus allows immediate appeal of an order granting or denying a preliminary injunction. <em>Montana Cannabis Indus. Ass\u2019n v. State, </em>2012 MT 201, \u00b6 13, 366 Mont. 224, 286 P.3d 1161. Because Davises\u2019 appeal irreconcilably conflates relief available at law on a common law ejectment claim with preliminary and final injunctive relief available as supplemental relief on a common law ejectment claim or on a statutory declaratory judgment, we accept their appeal on the above-restated issue pursuant to M. R. App. P. 6(3)(e) and \u00a7 3-2-204(5), MCA (mandatory review of all questions of fact and questions of law implicated on record in equity cases). However, we decline Westphals\u2019 cross-appeal without prejudice as a premature appeal of an uncertified interlocutory ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-7\">\u00b612 Summary judgment is proper only when there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. M. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(3). A genuine issue of material fact is an issue of inconsistent fact, material to the elements of a claim or defense at issue, and not amenable to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Mountain West Bank, N.A. v. Mine &amp; Mill Hydraulics, Inc., </em>2003 MT 35, \u00b6 28, 314 Mont. 248, 64 P.3d 1048; <em>see also </em>\u00a7 25-7-103, MCA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>(exclusive domain of finder of fact); <em>Weinberg v. Farmers State Bank, </em>231 Mont. 10, 27, 752 P.2d 719, 730 (1988) (exclusive domain of finder of fact to resolve questions of fact upon which reasonable people may differ). The party seeking summary judgment has the initial burden of showing a complete absence of any genuine issue of material fact on the Rule 56 record<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and that the party is thus entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Weber v. Interbel Tel. Coop., Inc., </em>2003 MT 320, \u00b6 5, 318 Mont. 295, 80 P.3d 88; <em>accord, Ereth, </em>\u00b6 11. The burden then shifts to the opposing party to show either the existence of a genuine issue of material fact or that the moving party is not entitled to judgment as a matter of law on the facts of record not subject to genuine material dispute. <em>Osterman v. Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., </em>2003 MT 327, \u00b6 17, 318 Mont. 342, 80 P.3d 435 (citing <em>Bruner v. Yellowstone Cnty., </em>272 Mont. 261, 264, 900 P.2d 901, 903 (1995)); <em>Ereth, </em>\u00b6 11. While the court must view the Rule 56 factual record in the light most favorable to the non-moving party and draw all reasonable inferences against summary judgment, <em>Weber, </em>\u00b6 5, the court has \u201cno duty to anticipate or speculate\u201d regarding contrary material facts. <em>Gamble Robinson Co. v. Carousel Properties, </em>212 Mont. 305, 312, 688 P.2d 282, 287 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">\u00b613 <em>Did the District Court erroneously deny summary judgment for immediate removal of Westphals\u2019 trespassing encroachments and restoration of Davises\u2019 land?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">\u00b614 Davises assert on appeal that the District Court erroneously refused to order Westphals to remove the subject encroachments and restore the property within 60 days of judgment with the proviso that Davises could remove the drain field and shop building at Westphals\u2019 expense if they failed to timely comply. Apart from their base request for a declaratory judgment of trespass, the Davises sought summary judgment \u201cejecting\u201d the encroachments, \u201cordering [their] immediate ... removal\u201d and restoration of the property, and permanently enjoining \u201cany further trespass\u201d or violation of applicable zoning setback requirements. Without reference to mandatory injunctive relief in the District Court and in contrast to their request for prohibitive injunctive relief, Davises sought an order compelling removal of the encroachments and restoration of the property as forms of relief available on the common law claim of ejectment. On appeal, Davises now assert that, in addition to common law ejectment, they are also entitled to mandatory injunctive relief compelling Westphals to remove <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>the encroachments and restore the property. Davises\u2019 conflation of the torts of common law trespass and ejectment, declaratory judgment of trespass, and supplemental preliminary and permanent equitable relief requires that we sort out these causes of action and remedies as a prelude to addressing their assertion of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">\u00b615 Modern common law trespass is an intentional tort claim for damages caused by an unauthorized entry or holdover upon real property of another. <em>Tags Realty, LLC v. Runkle, </em>2015 MT 166, \u00b6 15, 379 Mont. 416, 352 P.3d 616; <em>Tally Bissell Neighbors, Inc. v. Eyrie Shotgun Ranch, LLC, </em>2010 MT 63, \u00b6 38, 355 Mont. 387, 228 P.3d 1134; <em>Slater v. Shell Oil Co., </em>137 P.2d 713, 715 (Cal. App. 1943). The essential elements of a modern common law trespass claim are: (1) an intentional entry or holdover (2) by the defendant or a thing; (3) without consent or legal right. <em>Branstetter v. Beaumont Supper Club, Inc., </em>224 Mont. 20, 24, 727 P.2d 933, 935 (1986); <em>Restatement (Second) of Torts </em>\u00a7\u00a7 158 and 163 (1965). Because the legal harm is the interference with another\u2019s right to exclusive possession of property, an unauthorized tangible presence on the property of another constitutes a trespass regardless of whether the intrusion caused any other harm. <em>Tally, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 37-38 (distinguishing \u201ctangible\u201d invasion of property by person or thing from an \u201cintangible\u201d invasion, e.g., invasion of sound, light, odor, gas, or electromagnetic field, requiring proof of actual harm beyond mere infringement of right); <em>Restatement (Second) of Torts </em>\u00a7 163 cmt. d. A civil trespass encompasses both the initial unauthorized entry upon the property of another <em>and </em>the subsequent failure to cease or abate the intrusion. <em>Branstetter, </em>224 Mont. at 24, 727 P.2d at 935; <em>Restatement (Second) of Torts </em>\u00a7\u00a7 158 and 163.</p>\n<p id=\"AXY\">\u00b616  While civil trespass is an intentional tort, <em>Miller v. Nat\u2019l Broadcasting Co., </em>232 Cal. Rptr. 668, 677 (Cal. App. 1986), intentional trespass does not require proof of specific intent, i.e., that the tortfeasor intended to enter or remain upon property owned or controlled by another. <em>Restatement (Second) of Torts </em>\u00a7\u00a7 163 cmt. b, c and 164 cmt. a. The intent element of civil trespass only requires proof that the tortfeasor intentionally entered or remained, or caused a third party or thing to enter or remain, upon the property of another regardless of the tortfeasor\u2019s knowledge, lack of knowledge, or good faith mistake as to actual property ownership or right. <em>Luoma v. Donohoe, </em>179 Mont. 359, 365, 588 P.2d 523, <em>526 (1978; Miller, </em>232 Cal. Rptr. at 677; <em>Restatement (Second) of Torts </em>\u00a7\u00a7 163, cmt. b, c and 164 cmt. a; W.

In contrast to a common law trespass claim for damages and a modern statutory claim for judgment declaring a trespass as a predicate for supplemental legal or equitable relief, common law \u201cejectment\u201d is an independent cause of action of ancient origin and greatly evolved purpose and scope. <em>Sofer v.

The remedy available at law to effect a judgment of ejectment is execution under a special writ <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>known at common law as a writ of possession or ejectment, commanding the sheriff or levying officer to deliver possession of the property to the plaintiff by removing the defendant and personalty from the property.

Though ejectment technically lies to remedy a real property encroachment, a writ of possession commanding the sheriff to remove the defendant and personalty will generally not abate a substantial physical encroachment affixed to land. While a writ of possession could conceivably command a sheriff or levying officer to enter onto real property and affirmatively remove a trespassing encroachment, <em>see Heroux, </em>68 A.2d at 27-28, and <em>Butler, </em>186 N.Y. at 492-93, our general execution statutes govern writs of possession under Montana law. <em>Dodd, </em>113 Mont. at 542, 129 P.2d at 228. Davises did not raise the question of whether \u00a7\u00a7 25-13-201, -301(1)(d), and -307, MCA, would permit issuance of such an extraordinary writ of execution before the District Court and the issue is not properly before us at this time.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">\u00b620 Independent of common law trespass and ejectment claims, a modern declaratory judgment action is also available to determine the \u201crights, status, and other legal relations\u201d of the parties on any matter in dispute. Sections 27-8-201 and -301, MCA. Statutory declaratory judgment claims merely supplement other claims and remedies independently available at law or in equity. <em>See </em>M. R. Civ. P. 57; 26 C.J.S. <em>Declaratory Judgments </em>\u00a7\u00a7 1-2 (2011). Prohibitive and mandatory injunctive relief are forms of supplemental relief available where \u201cnecessary or proper\u201d to effect or enforce a declaratory judgment. Section 27-8-313, <em>MCA; Lindey\u2019s, </em>246 Mont. at 82-83, 802 P.2d at 1260. As an alternative or supplemental remedy to preexisting common law trespass and ejectment claims, a party may seek redress of a trespassing real property encroachment by seeking a declaratory judgment of trespass, supplemental damages as otherwise provided by law, and supplemental injunctive relief for abatement of the encroachment as otherwise authorized in equity. <em>See Lindey\u2019s, </em>246 Mont. at 82-83, 802 P.2d at 1260.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">\u00b621 Here, Davises obtained summary judgment declaring that Westphals\u2019 tree-felling and encroaching building and drain field constituted civil trespasses. As far as it goes, that declaratory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>judgment was the substantive equivalent of a judgment of ejectment declaring Davises\u2019 right to exclusive possession of their property to the exclusion of the subject encroachments. Thus, Davises successfully obtained an interlocutory judgment, prevailing on their alternatively pled declaratory judgment and common law ejection claims. Except for as yet undetermined damages not at issue on appeal, and in contrast to any supplemental injunctive relief otherwise appropriate in equity, no other relief at law is currently available to Davises on their common law ejectment claim prior to final judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"acj-dedup-0\">\u00b622  To the extent that Davises assert that the District Court erred by failing to further order ejectment of the subject encroachments, their \u201cimmediate removal,\u201d and restoration of the property, they seek forms of relief that are either premature or beyond the scope of relief available on a common law ejectment claim. The parties and the District Court have yet to consider whether a writ of possession executed by a sheriff or levying officer is available or adequate under \u00a7\u00a7 25-13-201, -301(1)(d), and -307, MCA, to abate the subject encroachments and restore possession of the property to Davises. Even if so, a writ of execution enforcing a judgment of possession still may not issue until the judgment is final. <em>See </em>M. R. Civ. P. 58 and 70(d); \u00a7\u00a7 25-13-101, -201, and -307, MCA. Davises do not assert that the District Court erred by failing to enter final judgment. Except as supplemental equitable relief, an order compelling a trespasser to remove an encroachment and to restore the property to its prior condition is not a cognizable form of relief available at law on a common law ejectment claim. We hold that the District Court did not err in declining to grant relief at law other than a declaration of trespass on Davises\u2019 common law ejectment claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">\u00b623 As to injunctive relief, it is unclear whether Davises assert that the District Court erred by failing to grant injunctive relief pursuant to \u00a7 27-8-313, MCA (relief supplemental to declaratory judgment), or as equitable relief supplemental to their common law ejectment claim. More significantly, it is further unclear from their briefing whether Davises assert that the court erroneously denied preliminary injunctive relief, permanent injunctive relief, or both. Regardless of whether requested pursuant to \u00a7 27-8-313, MCA, or as supplemental equitable relief necessary to afford complete relief on a common law claim, temporary and permanent injunctive relief are equitable remedies governed by general principles of equity codified in Montana in Title 27, ch. 19, MCA. <em>Talley v. Flathead Valley Comm. College, </em>259 Mont. 479, 491, 857 P.2d 701, 708 (1993); <em>State ex rel. Stewart v. District Ct., </em>77 Mont. 361, 369, 251 P. 137, 139 (1926); <em>see also, </em>M. R. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>Civ. P. 65. Contrary to Davises\u2019 assertion, injunctive relief is an extraordinary remedy not available as a matter of right. <em>Paradise Rainbows v. Fish &amp; Game Comm\u2019n, </em>148 Mont. 412, 420, 421 P.2d 717, 721 (1966). The grant or denial of permanent or preliminary injunctive relief is highly discretionary and critically dependent on the particular facts, circumstances, and equities of each case. <em>Shammel, </em>\u00b6 12; <em>Citizens for Balanced Use v. Maurier, </em>2013 MT 166, \u00b6\u00b6 11 and 28, 370 Mont. 410, 303 P.3d <em>794; Knudson v. McDunn, </em>271 Mont. 61, 65, 894 P.2d 295, <em>297-98 (1995); Montana Tavern Ass\u2019n v. State, </em>224 Mont. 258, 265, 729 P.2d 1310, 1315 (1986). Where necessary to afford complete relief, injunctive relief may be available either as an alternative or supplemental remedy to those ordinarily available by statute or at common law. <em>City of Whitefish v. Troy Town Pump, </em>2001 MT 58, \u00b6 35, 304 Mont. 346, 21 P.3d 1026 (court sitting in equity \u201cempowered to grant all relief necessary to the entire adjustment of the subject matter\u201d); <em>Restatement (Second) of Torts </em>\u00a7 951 cmt. a (under modern merger of law and equity all forms of legal and equitable relief are available to provide complete relief as necessary on a case basis). Thus, where appropriate on balance of the equities, injunctive relief is available as a supplemental remedy to afford complete relief on a common law ejectment claim. <em>See Jeppeson v.

On evidence or competent affidavit<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> considered <em>upon hearing, </em>a court may issue a preliminary injunction at any time before final judgment. Section 27-19-303, MCA. In considering whether to issue a preliminary injunction on any of the grounds enumerated in \u00a7 27-19-201, MCA, the court must exercise its discretion only in furtherance of the limited purpose of preliminary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>injunctions to preserve the status quo and minimize the harm to all parties <em>pending final resolution on the merits. Porter v. K &amp; S Partnership, </em>192 Mont. 175, 183, 627 P.2d 836, 840 (1981).

Thus, even on proof of any grounds enumerated in \u00a7 27-19-201, MCA, a preliminary injunction should not issue absent an accompanying prima facie showing, or showing that it is at least uncertain, that the applicant will suffer irreparable injury <em>prior to final resolution on the merits.

However, preliminary injunctions may not issue except upon evidence or affidavit considered at a duly noticed hearing. Section 27-19-303, MCA. Davises abandoned their initial motion for a preliminary injunction by stipulation long before they moved for summary judgment, did not clearly articulate a renewed request for a preliminary injunction in their summary judgment motion, and in any event failed to request a preliminary injunction hearing on or incident to their motion for summary judgment. Moreover, though they requested that the court \u201corder ejectment\u201d of the encroachments, compel Westphals to remove the encroachments, provide for \u201cforcible\u201d removal if necessary, and conditionally authorize them to remove them if Westphals failed to act, nowhere in Davises\u2019 conflated summary judgment motion and briefing was any reference to \u00a7 27-19-201(3), MCA, much less a factual <em>showing </em>that the failure to grant a preliminary mandatory injunction would render ineffectual any subsequent final judgment that might include, as appropriate, final injunctive relief. We will not hold a district court in error for failing to address an issue that parties did not timely raise. <em>McDunn v. Arnold, </em>2013 MT 138, \u00b6 14, 370 Mont. 270, 303 P.3d 1279.

Irreparable injury is a harm or wrong: (1) not fully or effectively remedied by compensatory damages; (2) in regard to which adequate, non-speculative compensation is difficult to determine; or (3) of a recurring or continuous nature such that full and effective redress would otherwise require a multiplicity of successive actions at law. <em>Wind v.

Milner, </em>2012 MT 88, 364 Mont. 523, 276 P.3d 934, for the proposition that it is reversible error for a court to refuse to grant a mandatory injunction compelling removal of a continuous or recurring encroachment upon determining the encroachment as a trespass. In <em>Olsen, </em>upon determining that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>defendant knowingly built a shop building partially on his neighbor\u2019s property, the district court issued a mandatory injunction compelling the defendant to remove the trespassing encroachment within 60 days subject to the plaintiffs right to remove it at the defendant\u2019s expense if he failed to timely do so. <em>Olsen, </em>\u00b6 15. However, the narrow issues on appeal in <em>Olsen </em>were whether res judicata barred the plaintiffs trespass claim and whether the court correctly determined that the encroachment was a trespass, not whether the court properly granted mandatory injunctive relief. <em>Olsen, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 18-38. In <em>Ducham, </em>the district court denied a request for permanent injunctive relief based on a determination that the defendant\u2019s recurring discharge of water across the plaintiffs property did not constitute a trespass. <em>Ducham, </em>265 Mont. at 438, 877 P.2d at 1004. On appeal, we held only that the court erroneously concluded that the water discharges were not a recurring trespass and that the plaintiff was thus entitled to a permanent injunction enjoining any further discharges across his property. <em>Ducham, </em>265 Mont. at 440-43, 877 P.2d at 1005-07. Apart from the threshold issue of trespass, the equities of permanent injunctive relief were not otherwise at issue on appeal. <em>Ducham, </em>265 Mont. at 440-43, 877 P.2d at 1005-07. Neither <em>Ducham </em>nor <em>Olsen </em>support Davises\u2019 assertion that a plaintiff is entitled to a mandatory injunction compelling abatement of a trespassing encroachment as a matter of right in every case.</p>\n<p id=\"a9t-dedup-0\">\u00b629  To the contrary, regardless of a determination of a trespass, the grant or denial of mandatory injunctive relief remains highly discretionary dependent on the unique facts and circumstances of each case. <em>Tally, </em>\u00b6 43 (flexible rules of equity require consideration of \u201cexigencies\u201d of each \u201cparticular case\u201d). Though legal title must generally prevail if the equities are equally balanced or balance against the trespasser, <em>Bonding Co. v. State Sav. Bank, </em>47 Mont. 332, 339, 133 P. 367, 368-69 (1913), the court must carefully weigh and balance the equities in each case when exercising its broad discretion to grant or deny injunctive relief. <em>Four Rivers Seed Co. v. Circle K Farms, </em>2000 MT 360, \u00b6 12, 303 Mont. 342, 16 P.3d 342.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Thus, though often <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>appropriate on abalance of the equities in particular cases, mandatory injunctive relief is not available to remedy a trespassing real property encroachment as a matter of right in every case.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">\u00b630 Here, unlike in <em>Ducham </em>and <em>Olsen, </em>the District Court has yet to grant or deny permanent injunctive relief upon entry of final judgment following full consideration of the equities. The court\u2019s grant of summary judgment declaring the subject encroachments as trespasses was merely an interlocutory order. <em>Trombley, </em>\u00b6 7. Permanent injunctions are available only upon entry of a final judgment. <em>Compare </em>\u00a7 27-19-102, MCA (final injunctions), <em>with </em>\u00a7\u00a7 27-19-201 and -303, MCA (preliminary injunctions). In its summary judgment order, the District Court did not make a final determination precluding mandatory injunctive relief upon further proceedings prior to entry of final judgment. The court merely concluded that Davises presented \u201cinsufficient information\u201d in support of their motion for summary judgment \u201cto determine whether coercive supplemental relief\u2019 is \u201cnecessary or appropriate\u201d in addition to money damages \u201cat this point in time.\u201d In narrowly concluding that Davises \u201chave provided no evidence upon which\u201d to conclude, <em>\u201cas a matter of law </em>that money damages\u201d will be \u201cinsufficient to remedy the harm,\u201d the District Court merely concluded that Davises failed to satisfy their initial burden under M. R. Civ. P. 56 of showing a complete absence of any genuine issue of fact material to their requested equitable relief.</p>\n<p id=\"A3Gs\">\u00b631  The parties fully submitted Davises\u2019 summary judgment motion to the court on their briefs. In support of the motion, Davises submitted only a one-page map prepared by a surveyor showing the boundary line encroachments, a copy ofWestphals\u2019 November 13,2015 letter accepting responsibility and apologizing for the encroachments, and the affidavit of Plaintiff Monte R. Davis regarding the nature, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>discovery, and continued existence of the encroachments. Though sufficient for the court to adjudicate the existence of continuing or recurring trespasses as a matter of law, this limited evidentiary record was insufficient to show a complete absence of any genuine issue of fact material as to whether the balance of the equities warranted the extraordinary remedy of a mandatory injunction compelling removal of the encroachments. This deficiency was particularly manifest when juxtaposed against the affidavit of Defendant Kathy L. Wilson and, as noted by the District Court, Westphals\u2019 stated willingness to remove the encroachments upon determination or negotiation of a reasonable deadline for removal. The summary judgment record was devoid of any evidence sufficient for the District Court to assess the urgency of removal and restoration, the burden and cost of removal and restoration, Westphals\u2019 means and ability to effect removal and restoration on the timeline requested, or any other relevant equitable consideration. Under these circumstances, we hold that, at this stage of the proceeding, the District Court\u2019s <em>interlocutory </em>denial of preliminary or final mandatory injunctive relief was neither irreconcilable with its summary judgment declaring a trespass nor a manifest abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">\u00b632 Davises failed to make any additional factual showing warranting injunctive relief in their subsequent M.
