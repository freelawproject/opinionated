We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-10\">\u00b62 We restate the issues on appeal as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-11\">\n<em>Issue One: Whether there was sufficient evidence to establish that Harrington knowingly possessed child pornography.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-13\">\n<em>Issue Two: Whether the statutory definition of possession, \u00a7 45-2-101(59), MCA, is unconstitutionally vague as applied to Harrington.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b263-16\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b263-17\">\u00b63 In 2012, Agent Albert Kinsey of the Department of Homeland Security utilized Child Protective System software to identify individuals in Montana engaged in file sharing of child pornography. Based on Agent Kinsey\u2019s investigation, four different Internet Protocol (IP) addresses in Montana were identified to be associated with child pornography images. Each IP address had files with descriptions and titles indicative of files containing child pornography. One of the IP addresses showed the use of keyword searches commonly associated with child pornography. All four of the IP addresses were assigned to Erin Nielsen in Great Falls, Montana.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-18\">\u00b64 Agent Kinsey contacted Great Falls Police Department Detective Jesse Slaughter and provided him with this information. Detective Slaughter obtained a search warrant for Nielsen\u2019s home. When officers executed the warrant, Nielsen denied ever looking at child pornography but told officers she had previously been in a relationship <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>with Harrington. Nielsen disclosed Harrington had lived with her until 2012. Further, Nielsen told Detective Slaughter her Wi-Fi signal is password protected; however, Harrington likely knew the password because he had placed a key logger device on her computer.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">\u00b65 Agent Kinsey and Detective Slaughter went to Harrington\u2019s home. They informed Harrington that they had just executed a search warrant at Nielsen\u2019s home regarding a child pornography investigation. Harrington admitted to using Frostwire<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to download two child pornography videos containing children aged seven and eight. Based upon Harrington\u2019s own admission, law enforcement asked Harrington to come down to the Great Falls Police Department for an interview. Harrington complied. Detective Slaughter seized a Sony laptop that was in plain view.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">\u00b66 Harrington consented to search of the Sony laptop, waived his <em>Miranda </em>rights, and agreed to answer questions. Harrington again admitted to downloading the two pornographic files with seven- and eight-year-old children. Harrington said he had recently uninstalled and deleted Frostwire because his computer had been infected with a Trojan horse virus. Harrington told Agent Kinsey that when he used Frostwire he always individually selected his downloads and never did mass downloads. During the interview, Agent Kinsey and Detective Slaughter noted Harrington\u2019s aptitude for computers.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-7\">\u00b67 Special Agent Brent Johnsrud of the Department of Homeland Security conducted a forensic examination of the laptop. Agent Johnsrud used EnCase, a computer software program, to locate image files in the allocated space on Harrington\u2019s laptop and did not locate any suspected child pornography image files. Then Agent Johnsrud used EnCase to locate files in the unallocated space<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> on Harrington\u2019s laptop. Agent Johnsrud located twenty-four suspected child pornography image files. Agent Johnsrud immediately recognized two of the child pornographic images because he had encountered them in past forensic examinations.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-8\">\u00b68 Agent Johnsrud recovered the twenty-four image files depicting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>child pornography. Agent Johnsrud explained during examination that those files were most likely cache files created by the laptop as a normal function of the operating system. When a video is played, the operating system creates a thumbnail, an indirect cache image that displays the first frame of the video. Thus, the files were the result of child pornography videos being played on the laptop. In addition, the cache image could have been saved to the hard drive if a user partially downloaded a video. The images found on Harrington\u2019s laptop most likely derived from incomplete videos being downloaded and viewed using the Frostwire software. Additionally, Agent Johnsrud discovered link files<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> containing names indicative of child pornography associated with Frostwire and the user account titled \u201cTalon.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The user downloading the file from Frostwire would have seen the name of the video file when it was selected.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">\u00b69 Agent Johnsrud concluded through his investigation that the video files had been deleted after having been opened and/or viewed. Further, Agent Johnsrud concluded based on the link files, that the video files were opened and/or viewed between October 21, 2012, and January 7, 2013.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">\u00b610 Based on the information discovered by Agents Kinsey and Johnsrud, the State charged Harrington with twenty-four counts of sexual abuse of children. On September 10, 2015, Harrington filed his first motion to dismiss based on insufficient evidence to prove the requisite mens rea. On October 5, 2015, Harrington filed his second motion to dismiss arguing that the statutory definition of possession is unconstitutionally vague as it applies to Harrington\u2019s case. On December 29, 2015, the District Court held a hearing on both motions. Subsequently, the District Court issued a Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order denying both motions. On June 1, 2016, Harrington pleaded guilty to one count of sexual abuse of children pursuant to a plea agreement. Harrington reserved the right to appeal the District Court\u2019s denial of the two motions. Harrington timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-7\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b265-8\">\u00b611 We conduct a de novo review of the record for sufficient evidence. <em>State v. Bekemans, </em>2013 MT 11, \u00b6 18, 368 Mont. 235, 293 P.3d 843. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>review the record for sufficient evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution. <em>State v. Gunderson, </em>2010 MT 166, \u00b6 58, 357 Mont. 142, 237 P.3d 74. There is sufficient evidence to support a conviction if any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>State v. Finley, </em>2011 MT 89, \u00b6 18, 360 Mont. 173, 252 P.3d 199.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">\u00b612 This Court reviews the denial of a motion to dismiss in a criminal case de novo. <em>State v. Dugan, </em>2013 MT 38, \u00b6 13, 369 Mont. 39, 303 P.3d 755. Statutes are presumed to be constitutional. A party challenging a statute\u2019s constitutionality must establish, \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt, that the statute is unconstitutional, and any doubt must be resolved in favor of the statute.\u201d <em>State v. Michaud, </em>2008 MT 88, \u00b6 15, 342 Mont. 244, 180 P.3d 636. The constitutionality of a statute is a question of law, which we review for correctness. <em>State v. Knudson, </em>2007 MT 324, \u00b6 12, 340 Mont. 167, 174 P.3d 469.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b266-7\">\u00b613 <em>Issue One: Whether there was sufficient evidence to establish that Harrington knowingly possessed child pornography.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b266-8\">\u00b614 The District Court determined that there was sufficient evidence to establish Harrington acted knowingly when he possessed child pornography. Harrington argues he could not possess dominion and control over the images because they were stored in unallocated space which could only be accessed using sophisticated forensic software. The State counters that although the images were found in unallocated space, Harrington\u2019s own admissions and conduct would allow a rational jury to find that Harrington knowingly possessed child pornography.</p>\n<p id=\"azn-dedup-1\">\u00b615 Section 45-5-625(1)(e), MCA, provides: \u201cA person commits the offense of sexual abuse of children if the person... knowingly possesses any visual or print medium, including a medium by use of electronic communications in which a child is engaged in sexual conduct, actual or simulated.\u201d Visual medium means, in part, \u201cany disk, diskette, or other physical media that allows an image to be displayed on a computer or other video screen and any image transmitted to a computer or other video screen by telephone line, cable, satellite transmission, or other method.\u201d Section 45-5-625(5)(d)(ii), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-9\">\u00b616 A person commits the offense of sexual abuse of children by, among other things, \u201cknowingly\u201d possessing photographs of a child engaged in actual or simulated sexual activity. In other words, possession of such photographs alone renders one in violation of \u00a7 45-5-625(1)(e), MCA. Therefore, the correct \u201cknowingly\u201d definition under \u00a7 45-5-625(1)(e), MCA, is \u201ca person acts knowingly with respect to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>conduct... when the person is aware of the person\u2019s own conduct....\u201d <em>State v. Hovey, </em>2011 MT 3, \u00b6 20, 359 Mont. 100, 248 P.3d 303 (quoting \u00a7 45-2-101(35), MCA).</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">\u00b617 Possession is defined as \u201cthe knowing control of anything for a sufficient time to be able to terminate control.\u201d Section 45-2-101(59), MCA. Possession can be actual or constructive. <em>State v. Meader, </em>184 Mont. 32, 42, 601 P.2d 386, 392 (1979) (internal citations omitted). Actual possession means that the contraband is in the personal custody of the person, whereas constructive possession means that the person charged with possession has dominion and control over the prohibited contraband. <em>Meader, </em>184 Mont. at 42, 601 P.2d at 392. The Ninth Circuit has reasoned, and we agree, that in an electronic context, a person can possess or receive child pornography without downloading it if he or she seeks it out and exercises dominion and control over it. <em>United States v. Romm, </em>455 F.3d 990, 1000 (9th Cir. 2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">\u00b618 Harrington relies principally on <em>United States v. Kuchinski, </em>469 F.3d 853 (9th Cir. 2006), and <em>United States v. Flyer, </em>633 F.3d 911 (9th Cir. 2011), to support his argument that he did not knowingly possess child pornography because the images found were in unallocated space. However, these cases are factually distinguishable from Harrington\u2019s case because in <em>Kuchinski </em>and <em>Flyer </em>the United States failed to present any evidence to show knowing possession of the child pornography files by the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-7\">\u00b619 In <em>Kuchinski, </em>the defendant was not held responsible for the thousands of images of child pornography found within his cache. <em>Kuchinski, </em>469 F.3d at 862-63. Kuchinski admitted to downloading 110 images of child pornography, but at sentencing he was held accountable for thousands of images found in the cache.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Kuchinski, </em>469 F.3d at 861-62. The Court noted that the thousands of images found within the cache could have been automatically downloaded when the 110 images were downloaded and viewed by Kuchinski. <em>Kuchinski, </em>469 F.3d at 862-63. Therefore, the Court concluded it was improper to consider the thousands of additional images found in the cache because there was no evidence he downloaded the additional images, clicked on the images, enlarged them, or viewed them. <em>Kuchinski, </em>469 F.3d at 863.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-8\">\u00b620 In <em>Flyer, </em>the defendant\u2019s possession of child pornography conviction was overturned. <em>Flyer, </em>633 F.3d at 919. The Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>established that the mere presence of child pornographic images in \u201cunallocated space\u201d on a computer hard drive, by itself, is not sufficient to prove knowing possession of child pornography. <em>Flyer, </em>633 F.3d at 919. Further, the Ninth Circuit concluded that \u201cdeletion of an image alone does not support a conviction for knowing possession of child pornography <em>....\" Flyer, </em>633 F.3d at 920.</p>\n<p id=\"aum-dedup-0\">\u00b621  Harrington argues that based on <em>Kuchinski </em>and <em>Flyer </em>this case must result in a dismissal of his charges. However, in <em>Kuchinski </em>the defendant never admitted to seeking out, downloading, or viewing the images in question. <em>Kuchinski, </em>469 F.3d at 862. Thus, <em>Kuchinski </em>held that images in the cache alone do not suffice to support a finding of knowing possession. <em>Kuchinski, </em>469 F.3dat 863. Similarly, Flyer made no admission that he had viewed the charged images on or near the time alleged in the indictment. <em>Flyer, </em>633 F.3d at 919. Consequently, <em>Flyer </em>held that images found in unallocated space without any other supporting evidence of possession do not suffice to support a finding of knowing possession. <em>Flyer, </em>633 F.3d at 911. Therefore, based on <em>Kuchinski </em>and <em>Flyer, </em>the State must have evidence that the child pornographic files on Harrington\u2019s laptop were not the product of an automatic or accidental download which were then deleted.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">\u00b622 Here, the State had evidence, other than the mere presence of the images in the unallocated space, to support that Harrington knowingly possessed the images. Harrington admitted to using Frostwire to intentionally seek out and download two pornographic videos containing children. Further, he admitted that he never mass downloaded from Frostwire, and therefore would individually pick out and download files from Frostwire. Harrington\u2019s laptop showed evidence that confirmed Harrington\u2019s admission. The forensic analysis conducted on the laptop not only discovered cache files in the hard drive but link files that could be directly traced back to the user name \u201cTalon.\u201d The link files had names indicative of child pornography and would have been visible to Harrington before opening them. The link file evidence shows that the videos associated with the user \u201cTalon\u201d had been viewed on the laptop. Taken together, these circumstances demonstrate more than sufficient evidence to support knowing possession of child pornography because there was more than just cache images or deleted images.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-7\">\u00b623 Harrington attempts to distinguish <em>Romm; </em>however, the case is more akin to Harrington\u2019s case than <em>Kuchinski </em>and <em>Flyer. </em>In <em>Romm, </em>the defendant\u2019s conviction for possessing child pornography was upheld. <em>Romm, </em>455 F.3d at 1001. Romm admitted to seeking out child pornography. <em>Romm, </em>455 F.3d at 1000. By Romm\u2019s own admission he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>would view the images for a few minutes, then he would delete the images. <em>Romm, </em>455 F.3d at 1000. While those images were displayed on his screen they were simultaneously stored to his cache. <em>Romm, </em>455 F.3d at 1000-01. The Court concluded based on the above-mentioned evidence a reasonable jury could conclude that Romm knowingly possessed child pornography. <em>Romm, </em>455 F.3d at 1001.</p>\n<p id=\"ArRJ\">\u00b624  Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, we agree with the District Court that there is sufficient evidence that a rational jury could have found Harrington guilty of sexual abuse of children because he knowingly possessed child pornography.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">\u00b625 <em>Issue Two: Whether the statutory definition of possession, \u00a7 45-2-101(59), MCA, is unconstitutionally vague as applied to Harrington.</em></p>\n<p id=\"AaT\">\u00b626 The District Court determined that the statutory definition of possession, \u00a7 45-2-101(59), MCA, was not vague as applied to Harrington. Harrington argues the statutory definition of possession criminalizes otherwise innocent conduct, such as deleting unwanted or illegal computer files. Therefore, Harrington asserts that he could not have understood what conduct would subject him to prosecution. The State counters that as applied to Harrington the statutory definition of possession is not unconstitutionally vague because Harrington sought out and downloaded child pornography, a clear violation of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-7\">\u00b627 We presume that all statutes are constitutional. <em>State v. Dixon, </em>2000 MT 82, \u00b6 14, 299 Mont. 165, 998 P.2d 544. A vagueness challenge to a statute may be maintained under two different theories: (1) because the statute is so vague that it is rendered void on its face; or (2) because it is vague as applied in a particular situation. <em>State v. Watters, </em>2009 MT 163, \u00b6 24, 350 Mont. 465, 208 P.3d 408. \u201cIt is a basic principle of due process that an enactment is void for vagueness if its prohibitions are not clearly defined.\u201d <em>Dugan, </em>\u00b6 66 (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b269-8\">\u00b628 For vague-as-applied challenges, a court must determine (1) whether the statute in question provides a person with \u201cactual notice\u201d and (2) whether it provides \u201cminimal guidelines\u201d to law enforcement. <em>Dugan, </em>\u00b6 67 (citing <em>Watters, </em>\u00b6 32). To determine whether the challenged statute provides \u201cactual notice,\u201d courts examine the statute in light of the defendant\u2019s conduct to determine if the defendant reasonably could have understood that the statute prohibited such conduct. <em>Watters, </em>\u00b6 32. Therefore, the issue is whether Harrington could have reasonably understood that the statute proscribed his conduct\u2014seeking out and downloading child pornography.</p>\n<p id=\"Abz\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>\u00b629  Section 45-2-101(59), MCA, which Harrington challenges as unconstitutionally vague as applied to him, defines possession as \u201cthe knowing control of anything for a sufficient time to be able to terminate control.\u201d First, we determine if the statute would provide actual notice to Harrington of what conduct is proscribed. The statute clearly applies to Harrington\u2019s conduct. Harrington pleaded guilty to the possession of child pornography. Harrington admitted to seeking out, and downloading child pornography. Then Harrington deleted the files, resulting in the images being stored in the unallocated space of his laptop\u2019s hard drive. Knowingly downloading child pornography with the intent to view and then deleting it would fall within a reasonable understanding of \u201cpossession.\u201d A reasonable person of average intelligence would have clearly understood that entering search terms associated with child pornography into Frostwire and then downloading child pornography files would fall within the scope of possession of child pornography.</p>\n<p id=\"AaHV\">\u00b630  Second, we determine whether the Legislature established minimal guidelines to govern law enforcement regarding Harrington\u2019s conduct. Here, Harrington contends that the definition of possession regarding computer images could include otherwise innocent conduct. Harrington admitted to searching child pornography and then downloaded two specific files with children seven and eight years old. Clearly, Harrington knowingly controlled the files of child pornography on his laptop sufficiently to delete them. Harrington\u2019s arguments that a prosecutor could bring charges against a defendant who involuntarily downloaded child pornography and then immediately disposed of it do not apply to Harrington\u2019s conduct. Harrington knowingly sought out multiple child pornography files to download; this is clearly not a case of involuntary download. We conclude that \u00a7 45-2-101(59), MCA, is not unconstitutionally vague as applied to Harrington\u2019s conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b270-7\">\u00b631 We conclude that the District Court did not err when it determined that the State presented sufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to find that Harrington knowingly possessed child pornography. Further, we conclude that Montana\u2019s statutory definition of possession under \u00a7 45-2-101(59), MCA, is not unconstitutionally vague as applied to Harrington\u2019s conduct. Therefore, the District Court properly denied Harrington\u2019s motions to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-8\">\u00b632 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b270-9\">JUSTICES SHEA, BAKER, SANDEFUR and RICE concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b264-9\"> Frostwire is a peer-to-peer network.
