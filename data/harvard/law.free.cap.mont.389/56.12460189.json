The District Court sentenced Old Bull to ten years in the Montana Women\u2019s Prison (MWP), parole restricted for the entire term, on her conviction for criminal endangerment in violation of \u00a7 45-5-207, MCA; and ten years in MWP, parole restricted for seven and one-half years, on her conviction for obstructing justice in violation of \u00a7 45-7-303, MCA, to be served consecutively to her criminal endangerment sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-8\">\u00b62 We address the following issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-9\">\n<em>Issue One: Whether the District Court erred by imposing a parole eligibility restriction on Old Bull\u2019s sentence for obstructing justice. Issue Two: Whether the District Court erred by requiring Old Bull to register as a violent offender.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b83-10\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b83-11\">\u00b63 On March 2, 2015, Old Bull and her boyfriend Clint Hogan took Hogan\u2019s unresponsive six-year-old daughter, K.H., to Hardin Hospital. K.H. was then transported to Denver Children\u2019s Hospital where she died from her injuries. When interviewed separately, Hogan and Old Bull independently reported that K.H. was in good health when Hogan left to go to the store, that she was unresponsive when Hogan returned, and that she never regained consciousness. According to the Presentence Investigation Report (PSI) ordered by the District Court, Old Bull and Hogan waited roughly two hours before seeking medical attention for K.H. During the State\u2019s investigation into K.H.\u2019s death, Old Bull told law enforcement that K.H. fell in the shower, which led to her injury. This account conflicted with the treating hospital assessment that K.H.\u2019s injuries resulted from a traumatic forceful blow to the head and blunt force trauma that could not have been caused by an accidental fall. K.H. also \u201chad evidence of both fresh and historical bruising over her entire body, consistent with habitual abuse.\u201d Old Bull later admitted that she provided false information to law enforcement regarding Hogan\u2019s involvement in the crime because she was scared to stand up to Hogan.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-12\">\u00b64 The State initially charged Old Bull with deliberate homicide of K.H. On November 13, 2015, the State amended these charges, pursuant to a plea agreement, to criminal endangerment and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>obstructing justice. Old Bull pled guilty to these charges. As part of the plea agreement, Old Bull admitted that she \u201cengaged in conduct that created a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury to another, specifically [K.H].\u201d She also admitted to providing the police with false information regarding Hogan\u2019s role in K.H.\u2019s death. At sentencing, Old Bull never disputed that K.H. died due to blunt force trauma; however, Old Bull did dispute whether she had been the cause of K.H.\u2019s injury.</p>\n<p id=\"ATh\">\u00b65 Due to what the District Court characterized as Old Bull\u2019s \u201cheinous\u201d conduct that resulted in K.H.\u2019s death, the Court restricted Old Bull\u2019s parole eligibility for the entire ten-year sentence for criminal endangerment and for seven and one-half years of the consecutive ten-year sentence for obstructing justice. Hogan received a ten-year suspended sentence for obstructing justice during the investigation into K.H.\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">\u00b66 At Old Bull\u2019s sentencing, the District Court stated on the record\u2014without distinguishing between the criminal endangerment charge and the obstructing justice charge\u2014its rationale for the parole restrictions. The Court stated: \u201cYou have a child who is dead here; [she] has passed away. And there is evidence that this child endured habitual abuse. The Court will not turn a blind eye to that.\u201d The Court further stated that it could see no \u201cjustification for treating a child the way this child was treated or engaging in conduct that would allow for such treatment\u201d and found it \u201cappropriate ... [to] impose an equally severe sentence.\u201d The Court also emphasized the lasting trauma to the family and community caused by K.H.\u2019s death. Further, the District Court stated that the parole restrictions would ensure that Old Bull have access to programs while in MWP to help address anger and emotional issues and, therefore, have a chance at rehabilitation. The District Court specified that the rationale for imposition of the sentence and judgment were also \u201cthe reasons for ineligibility for parole,\u201d reemphasizing that the death of K.H., a young child, required a \u201csufficient level of punishment and accountability.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">\u00b67 Old Bull argued against any parole restriction on the basis that it would limit the Parole Board\u2019s exercise of authority and discretion. Old Bull made no other specific objections to the parole restrictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-7\">\u00b68 In its written judgment, the District Court enumerated thirty-three recommended terms and conditions for \u201cany period of community based supervision\u201d for the felony obstructing justice conviction, including the requirement that Old Bull register as a violent offender. The Court also restated its reasons for restricting Old Bull\u2019s parole; specifically, the \u201cheinous nature\u201d of Old Bull\u2019s criminal conduct that \u201cresulted in severe bodily injury to the child victim, [K.H.], from which the child ultimately died,\u201d evidence in the PSI indicating habitual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>abuse of K.H., justice for the horrific circumstances of the crime, and, finally, that sufficient time, in confinement would allow Old Bull to engage in rehabilitative programming. Old Bull appeals the District Court\u2019s parole eligibility restriction on her sentence for obstructing justice and the parole condition that she register as a violent offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">\u00b69 We review for legality a district court\u2019s restrictions on parole eligibility and sentencing on criminal sentences that include at least one year of incarceration. <em>State v. Ariegwe, </em>2007 MT 204, \u00b6 174, 338 Mont. 442, 167 P.3d 815. Whether a restriction or sentence is legal is a question of law, and our review is de novo. <em>Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 174-75; <em>see also State v. Ashby, </em>2008 MT 83, \u00b6 9, 342 Mont. 187, 179 P.3d 1164; <em>State v. Paulsrud, </em>2012 MT 180, \u00b6 9, 366 Mont. 62, 285 P.3d 505. If a sentencing condition is legal, we then review the challenged condition for abuse of discretion. <em>City of Bozeman v. Cantu, </em>2013 MT 40, \u00b6 11, 369 Mont. 81, 296 P.3d 461; <em>State v. Blake, </em>274 Mont. 349, 908 P.2d 676, 677 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b85-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b85-8\">\u00b610 <em>Issue One: Whether the District Court erred by imposing a parole eligibility restriction on Old Bull\u2019s sentence for obstructing justice.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b85-9\">\u00b611 Generally, we will not review on appeal an issue that a party failed to preserve through objection at trial. <em>State v. Kotwicki, </em>2007 MT 17, \u00b6 8, 335 Mont. 344, 151 P.3d 892; <em>see also Ashby, </em>\u00b6 22 (explicitly refusing to review an unchallenged condition in light of a defendant\u2019s failure to object in district court). We will, however, review a criminal sentence alleged to be illegal or in excess of statutory mandates even absent a defendant\u2019s raised objection in district court. <em>State v. Lenihan, </em>184 Mont. 338, 343, 602 P.2d 997, 1000 (1979). A sentencing condition is illegal \u201cif the sentencing court lacked statutory authority to impose it, if the condition falls outside the parameters set by applicable sentencing statutes, or if the court did not adhere to the affirmative mandates of the applicable sentencing statutes .\u201d <em>State v. Heddings, </em>2008 MT 402, \u00b6 11, 347 Mont. 169, 198 P.3d 242 (citing <em>State v. Stephenson, </em>2008 MT 64, \u00b6 15, 342 Mont. 60, 179 P.3d 502) (internal citations omitted). Conversely, a sentence that is merely disparate does not rise to the level of illegality. <em>State v. Webb, </em>2005 MT 5, \u00b6 8, 325 Mont. 317, 106 P.3d 521; <em>see also State ex rel. Greely v. District Court, </em>180 Mont. 317, 327, 590 P.2d 1104, 1109-10 (1979) (holding that a defendant has the right to have a sentence reviewed for equality or disparity by the Sentence Review Board and citing \u00a7\u00a7 46-18-901-905, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>MCA); <em>see also State v. Simtob, </em>154 Mont. 286, 288, 462 P.2d 873, 874 (1969) (clarifying that sentence disparity and equality should be reviewed by a sentencing board, whereas this Court reviews a sentence to determine legality). A district court\u2019s failure to abide by a statutory requirement may rise to an objectionable sentence, though not necessarily an illegal one. <em>Kotwicki, </em>\u00b6 13; see <em>also State v. Bullplume, </em>2013 MT 169, \u00b6 17, 370 Mont. 453, 305 P.3d 753. Thus, when a district court, \u201cif provided the opportunity to consider the error now asserted on appeal, could nevertheless have imposed the same sentence, the illegality requirement of the <em>Lenihan </em>exception has not been met.\u201d <em>Bullplume, </em>\u00b617.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">\u00b612 Old Bull argues that her parole restriction of seven and one-half years for obstructing justice is illegal, and therefore reviewable by this Court under <em>Lenihan </em>because: (1) it led to an unreasonably disparate sentence as compared to Hogan\u2019s sentence; (2) the District Court failed to orally pronounce the reasons for the parole restriction specifically as to the obstructing justice conviction as required by \u00a7 46-18-115(6), MCA; and (3) the District Court exceeded its statutory authority under \u00a7 46-18-202(2), MCA, when it restricted parole as to obstructing justice based on conduct punished by Old Bull\u2019s criminal endangerment sentence. The State counters that the District Court legally imposed parole restrictions on the obstructing justice sentence, and that Old Bull waived any other challenges as to the reasonableness of the restrictions when she failed to raise specific objections at the time of sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">\u00b613 Old Bull\u2019s first argument fails because a sentence or restriction within the statutory parameters that is merely disparate or different than a co-defendant or other charged defendant does not rise to the level of illegality. <em>Webb, </em>\u00b6 8. Old Bull and Hogan were separately convicted of obstructing justice in violation of \u00a7 45-7-303, MCA; Old Bull was sentenced to serve ten years with a parole restriction for the first seven and one-half years of the sentence. Hogan received a ten-year suspended sentence. Both sentences fell within the statutory maximum sentence of imprisonment of ten years. Section 45-7-303, MCA. Any challenge to the sentence or parole restriction based on disparate treatment is best directed toward the Sentence Review Division. Sections 46-18-901 et seq., MCA; <em>Simtob, </em>154 Mont. at 287-88, 462 P.2d 574-75; <em>see also State v. Rickman, </em>2008 MT 142, \u00b6\u00b6 11, 16, 20, 343 Mont. 120, 183 P.3d 49.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-7\">\u00b614 Second, Old Bull asserts that the parole restriction is illegal because the Court failed to orally pronounce its rationale for the restriction. Section 46-18-115(6), MCA, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-8\">In felony cases, the court shall specifically state all reasons for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>sentence, including restrictions, conditions, or enhancements imposed, in open court on the record and in the written judgment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ApU\">This argument also fails because the parole restriction neither exceeds the statutory authority of ten years imprisonment, \u00a7 45-7-303, MCA, nor falls outside the affirmative mandates of the sentencing statutes; the restriction is therefore legal, <em>Heddings, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 11, 20. The District Court orally detailed its rationale for imposing parole restrictions on Old Bull\u2019s sentence during the sentencing hearing. The District Court stated that its aim was to provide appropriate punishment for Old Bull\u2019s admitted criminal conduct, with an emphasis on the extremely tragic results of such conduct, as well as to protect the community from any such conduct in the future. Finally, the District Court stated the restriction would provide Old Bull with the opportunity to engage in rehabilitative and self-improvement programs while in confinement. Although the District Court did not specifically reference which conduct was attributable to which count, the Court articulated its reasons for the sentence and legally sentenced Old Bull within statutory parameters. <em>See Bullplume, </em>\u00b6 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">\u00b615 Third, Old Bull argues that the District Court\u2019s parole restriction as to the obstructing justice conviction was illegal because the restriction was based on conduct more reasonably attributed to her criminal endangerment conviction. We disagree. Old Bull\u2019s obstructing justice sentence, including the parole restriction, was within the statutory power of the District Court. <em>See Heddings, </em>\u00b6 11. District courts may limit parole eligibility under \u00a7 46-18-202(2), MCA, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-6\">Whenever the sentencing judge imposes a sentence of imprisonment in a state prison for a term exceeding 1 year, the sentencing judge may also impose the restriction that the offender is ineligible for parole and participation in the supervised release program while serving that term. If the restriction is to be imposed, the sentencing judge shall state the reasons for it in writing. If the sentencing judge finds that the restriction is necessary for the protection of society, the judge shall impose the restriction as part of the sentence and the judgment must contain a statement of the reasons for the restriction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b87-7\"><em>State v. Branham, </em>2012 MT 1, \u00b6 27, 363 Mont. 281, 269 P.3d 891; <em>see alsoPaulsrud, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 15-16. As detailed above, the District Court provided its rationale for the parole restrictions both in its oral pronouncement and in its written judgment. The Court legally imposed restrictions on Old Bull\u2019s eligibility for parole for obstructing justice and acted within the scope of its statutory authority under \u00a7\u00a7 46-18-202(2), 115(6), and 45-7-303, MCA. <em>See Lenihan, </em>184 Mont. at 343, 602 P.2d at 1000.</p>\n<p id=\"At4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>\u00b616  District courts have broad discretion to consider various factors and holistically fashion sentences, including parole restrictions. <em>Paulsrud, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 15-16 (reiterating that a district court retains broad discretion to make parole eligibility decisions, consider all relevant facts and circumstances, including evidence relating to the crime, the \u201cdefendant\u2019s character, background history, mental and physical condition, and any other evidence the court considers to have probative force\u201d). The District Court\u2019s parole restriction on Old Bull\u2019s obstructing justice sentence was not illegal. At sentencing, Old Bull objected only generally to the imposition of any parole restriction because of the limitation it would place on the Parole Board\u2019s future exercise of discretion. She did not make the objections she now wishes us to consider on appeal. Because Old Bull failed to preserve her objections to what is otherwise a legal sentence, our review is limited under <em>Lenihan. See Kotowicki, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 8, 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">\u00b617 We affirm the District Court\u2019s imposition of a seven and one-half year parole restriction on Old Bull\u2019s obstructing justice sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">\u00b618 <em>Issue Two: Whether the District Court erred by requiring Old Bull to register as a violent offender.</em></p>\n<p id=\"A3d\">\u00b619  Violent offender status is \u201cdetermined purely by statute.\u201d <em>State v. Miller, </em>1998 MT 177, \u00b6 41, 290 Mont. 97, 966 P.2d 721 (1998). A district court lacks statutory authority to require violent offender registration for a conviction not listed among the \u201c Violent offenses\u2019 \u201d that require registration. <em>State v. Rowe, </em>2009 MT 225, \u00b6\u00b6 32-33, 351 Mont. 334, 217 P.3d 471. Neither of the crimes of which Old Bull was convicted are included among the crimes requiring violent offender registration. <em>See Rowe, </em>\u00b6 33. Old Bull therefore argues that the violent offender requirement imposed by the District Court\u2019s judgment is illegal, and reviewable under <em>Lenihan. </em>The State concedes this issue and agrees the condition should be stricken from the judgment. Therefore, we remand for the sole purpose of striking the condition requiring Old Bull to register as a violent offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-8\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b88-9\">\u00b620 We affirm the District Court\u2019s imposition of a seven and one-half year parole restriction on Old Bull\u2019s obstructing justice sentence. We remand for the sole purpose of striking the condition that Old Bull register as a violent offender.</p>\n<judges id=\"b88-10\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES WHEAT, SANDEFUR and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
