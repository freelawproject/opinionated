We affirm, addressing the following issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-5\"><em>Did the District Court err by dismissing the petition to modify the parenting plan without conducting a </em>hearing?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b95-7\">\u00b62 Chellie and William were married in 1999 and had two children together, R.J.N. and H.E.N. The marriage was dissolved in 2007, and the parties\u2019 stipulated parenting plan was approved and ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-8\">\u00b63 In 2011, Chellie gave notice of her intention to move to California, and proposed a parenting plan amendment that would substantially restrict William\u2019s time with the children. In response, William also moved to modify the parenting plan. The Standing Master conducted a hearing on the proposed modifications and, on January 10, 2013, entered findings of fact, conclusions of law and an order adopting an amended parenting plan that provided the children would spend a majority of their time with William. The Master concluded that a threshold change of circumstances necessitating a hearing had occurred because of Chellie\u2019s intention to relocate to California with the children, and her asserted \u201cacts of parental alienation\u201d against William. The Master found that Chellie had \u201cengaged in various acts which are forms of parental alienation,\u201d including refusing to allow William to exercise his scheduled time with the children despite his repeated requests, and found that there was \u201cstrong evidence that Father\u2019s relationship with his children has been severely damaged as a result of [Chellie\u2019s] proposed relocation to California with the children.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b95-9\">\u00b64 In February 2015, Chellie moved to modify the 2013 Amended Parenting Plan. Her motion stated \u201c[t]he basis for this motion is that R.J.N. will be fifteen [15] years of age as of April, 2015, and H.E.N. is twelve [12] years of age, and both children desire a change from the children residing primarily with [William] to a new parenting plan where they reside primarily with [Chellie.]\u201d Her supporting affidavit simply reiterated the children\u2019s ages and their desire to live primarily with Chellie. William moved to dismiss Chellie\u2019s motion, arguing that it failed to demonstrate changed circumstances necessary for a hearing to be conducted on modification of the parenting plan. The Master entered an order summarily denying Chellie\u2019s motion. Chellie filed objections, arguing the Master should have held an evidentiary hearing and conducted an <em>in camera </em>interview of the children. After briefing and a hearing in which argument was received, the District Court affirmed the order, reasoning that \u201cChellie failed to meet the threshold showing for a hearing, and the Standing Master correctly granted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>[William\u2019s] Motion to Dismiss. ...\u201d Chellie appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">\u00b65 When considering parenting plan modifications, we review conclusions of law for whether they are correct. <em>In re Marriage of Guffin, </em>2010 MT 100, \u00b6 20, 356 Mont. 218, 232 P.3d 888. Two standards of review are relevant in a case involving both a standing master and the district court: the standard the district court applies to the master's report and the standard we apply to the district court\u2019s decision. <em>In re Marriage of Davis, </em>2016 MT 52, \u00b6 4, 382 Mont. 378, 367 P.3d 400 (citing <em>In re Marriage of Kostelnik, </em>2015 MT 283, \u00b6 15, 381 Mont. 182, 357 P.3d 912). We review a district court\u2019s decision <em>de novo </em>to determine whether it applied the correct standard of review to a standing master\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law. <em>Kostelnik, </em>\u00b6 15 (citing <em>In re Marriage of Patton, </em>2015 MT 7, \u00b6 17, 378 Mont. 22, 340 P.3d 1242). A district court reviews a standing master\u2019s findings of fact for clear error, <em>Patton, </em>\u00b6 24, and its conclusions of law to determine if they are correct. <em>Patton, </em>\u00b6 43.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b96-8\">\u00b66 <em>Did the District Court err by dismissing the petition to modify the parenting plan without conducting a </em>hearing?</p>\n<p id=\"b96-9\">\u00b67 Chellie argues that because one of the children was fourteen years of age, and wished to reside primarily with her, these circumstances provided sufficient grounds to warrant a hearing on her proposed modification to the parenting plan. William responds that the Standing Master and District Court correctly concluded Chellie did not satisfy her burden under the statute to establish a change in circumstances necessary to justify a hearing on modification.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-10\">\u00b68 Section 40-4-219(1), MCA, provides the standards for modification of a parenting plan, requiring a change of circumstances to have occurred and a finding that an amendment is necessary to serve the best interest of the child:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-11\">The court may in its discretion amend a prior parenting plan if it finds, upon the basis of facts that have arisen since the prior plan or that were unknown to the court at the time of entry of the prior plan, that a change has occurred in the circumstances of the child and that the amendment is necessary to serve the best interest of the child.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b96-12\">As provided, these standards are to be satisfied \u201cupon the basis of facts that have arisen since the prior plan or that were unknown to the court at the time of the entry of the prior plan.\u201d Section 40-4-219(1), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>\u00b69 Pursuant to \u00a7 40-4-220(1), MCA, the party seeking modification \u201cmust file a motion and supporting affidavit showing cause for modification.\u201d <em>In re Marriage of D\u2019Alton, </em>2009 MT 184, \u00b6 9, 351 Mont. 51, 209 P.3d 251. Requests for parenting plan modifications \u201cmust satisfy an initial statutory threshold of changed circumstances.\u201d <em>In re Marriage of Whyte, </em>2012 MT 45, \u00b6 23, 364 Mont. 219, 272 P.3d 102; <em>D\u2019Alton, </em>\u00b6 9. A demonstration of changed circumstances is a \u201cprerequisite\u201d to amendment of a parenting plan, and \u201ca district court may not modify an existing custody arrangement\u201d without such a finding. <em>In re Marriage of Jacobsen, </em>2006 MT 212, \u00b6 17, 333 Mont. 323, 142 P.2d 859 <em>(citing In re Marriage of Oehlke, </em>2002 MT 79, \u00b6 12, 309 Mont. 254, 46 P.3d 49). The party seeking modification of a parenting plan \u201ccarries a heavy burden of proof.\u201d <em>D\u2019Alton, </em>\u00b6 11. Section 40-4-220(1), MCA, provides that a court \u201cshall deny the motion unless it finds that adequate cause for hearing the motion is established by the affidavits, based on the best interest of the child, in which case it shall set a date for hearing ....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">\u00b610 Here, Chellie argues the District Court erred in denying her request for a hearing. The District Court concluded that the assertions in Chellie\u2019s motion and affidavit about R.J.N.\u2019s age and the children\u2019s desire to live primarily with her \u201cdo not constitute a sufficiently changed circumstance warranting a hearing under \u00a7 40-4-220(1), MCA.\u201d It cited our statement in <em>D\u2019Alton </em>that \u201cthe mere aging of children so that they are now in school could hardly be considered \u2018unknown to the court at the time of the entry of the prior plan\u2019 as required by \u00a7 40-4-219(1), MCA,\u201d <em>D\u2019Alton, </em>\u00b6 11, to conclude that \u201c[t]he mere passage of time is not sufficient to establish a changed circumstance of the child.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">\u00b611 We recognize that one of the statutory criteria in determining a child\u2019s best interest is whether \u201cthe child is 14 years of age or older and desires the amendment,\u201d which the District Court may discretionarily consider and weigh. Section 40-4-219(l)(c), MCA. While we have not adopted a blanket rule that the aging of a child, in conjunction with consideration of his or her desires, can never constitute a change in circumstances warranting a hearing on modification, we agree with the District Court\u2019s conclusion that such a change was not demonstrated here. The parties\u2019 parenting plan was recently revised after substantial litigation, and though the children\u2019s wishes were not expressly considered at that time, their ages were noted and their circumstances were extensively assessed. Chellie\u2019s pleadings simply noted the children\u2019s current ages and their desire to live primarily with her. With nothing more, Chellie\u2019s assertions appeared to merely return the case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>to the core issue litigated shortly before, in 2013: Chellie\u2019s desire to have the children move with her to California, a plan that was found at that time to have \u201cseverely damaged\u201d the children\u2019s relationship with William.</p>\n<p id=\"AOx\">\u00b612  A district court has \u201cbroad discretion when considering the parenting of a child.\u201d <em>In re Marriage of Tummarello, </em>2012 MT 18, \u00b6 34, 363 Mont. 387, 270 P.3d 28. However, in a modification context, such discretion is contoured by an initial determination of changed circumstances, a legal conclusion. <em>See, e.g., Jacobsen, </em>\u00b6 17; <em>Oehlke, </em>\u00b6 12; <em>Whyte, </em>\u00b6 28. The statute promotes stability for the children and discourages unnecessary litigation over parenting plans. <em>Whyte, </em>\u00b6 23. We conclude the District Court correctly concluded that the Standing Master\u2019s decision dismissing the petition was legally correct as failing to demonstrate a change in circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">\u00b613 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b98-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES WHEAT and BAKER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b98-8\">JUSTICE BAKER,</author>\n<p id=\"AI0\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-9\">\u00b614 In light of the statutory standards for amendment of a parenting plan and our case law, the circumstances of this case\u2014particularly the recent litigation over the parenting plan\u2014did not mandate a hearing as a matter of law on Chellie\u2019s petition, and I agree with the Court\u2019s disposition of her appeal. But today\u2019s decision should not be read to minimize the expressed wishes of teenaged children who are coping with their separated families.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-10\">\u00b615 I agree with most of what Justice McKinnon expresses in her Dissent. The problem is that \u00a7 40-4-219, MCA, requires a showing of changed circumstances <em>\u201cand </em>that the amendment is necessary to serve the best interest of the child.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The statute provides that a teenage child\u2019s wishes are to be considered \u201c[i]n determining the child\u2019s best interest,\u201d not in determining whether there has been a change in circumstances. Section 40-4-219(1), MCA. We thus have held that age alone does not automatically qualify as a \u201cchanged circumstance\u201d sufficient to justify a parenting plan amendment. <em>See D Alton, </em>\u00b6 11 (concluding that children\u2019s \u201cchanged circumstances\u201d of being six years older than at time of parenting plan did not \u201csatisfy the initial threshold criteria for this Court to order a show cause hearing to amend the parenting plan\u201d); <em>Whyte, </em>\u00b6 24 (holding that change in child\u2019s age did not constitute a \u201cchanged circumstance\u201d sufficient to justify district court\u2019s amendment of the parties\u2019 parenting plan). But as a child grows up, that child\u2019s circumstances may change in myriad ways that no one thought about when the parenting plan was adopted. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>Developments in a child\u2019s life, seemingly routine from a court\u2019s perspective, may have significant consequences to an adolescent at a vulnerable time in life. The child\u2019s wishes are entitled to serious consideration in order to protect the best interest of the child, even if it means dragging the court back into the family\u2019s affairs.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">\u00b616 In light of the language and interpretation of the statute, parents who want to maintain control over the governance of their own family may be able to prevent ongoing court involvement by negotiating parenting plans in the first place that acknowledge the importance of their children\u2019s changing needs and desires as the children grow up. For example, parents could agree to an opportunity for review of the plan and of the child\u2019s best interest if the child expresses a desire to change the plan after turning fourteen. This assumes, of course, that the parents start with the child\u2019s best interest truly at heart and maintain that focus on putting the child\u2019s interest first. That is key to the success of any parenting plan. To guard against manipulation, the parenting plan could include a requirement that the moving party pay the other parent\u2019s attorney fees if the court determines that a modification request is not pursued in good faith based on the child\u2019s best interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">\u00b617 It is important that parties have effective and equal access to the courts to resolve contentious parenting disputes, or in cases where collaborative solutions are not appropriate given the family\u2019s dynamics. But court processes can be inadequate means to handle \u201cthe custody and placement of innocent children.\u201d <em>In re Brockington, </em>2017 MT 92, \u00b6 37, 387 Mont. 260, 400 P.3d 205 (McGrath, C.J., dissenting); <em>see also Whyte, </em>\u00b6 45 (Baker, J., dissenting). Participants in our justice system must continue to find ways to help families recognize the best interest of their children and meet the needs of all family members without court intervention. If court intervention is needed, the district court is in the best position to determine the weight to be given a child\u2019s expressed desires. <em>See In re Marriage of Graham, </em>2008 MT 435, \u00b6 8, 347 Mont. 483, 199 P.3d 211; <em>In re Marriage of Burk, </em>2002 MT 173, \u00b6\u00b6 20-24, 310 Mont. 498, 51 P.3d 1149. In most cases the court at least should consider those desires before summarily denying a motion to amend. Here, however, Chellie\u2019s petition fell short of what we have required to compel a hearing.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b99-7\">JUSTICE McKINNON,</author>\n<p id=\"AcG\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-8\">\u00b618 Section 40-4-219, MCA, is the statute in Montana dedicated to amending parenting plans. A court may amend a parenting plan if it finds, upon the basis of facts that have arisen since the prior parenting plan, that: (1) a change in the circumstances of the child has occurred, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>and (2) the amendment is necessary to serve the best interests of the child. Section 40-4-219(1), MCA. Section 40-4-219, MCA, directs the court in its substantive analysis of whether an amendment is necessary. Importantly, \u00a7 40-4-219(1)(c), MCA, expressly provides that the court may consider that \u201cthe child is 14 years of age or older and desires the amendment.\u201d Other statutory factors warranting further inquiry by the court, which are also expressly set forth, are whether \u201cthe parents agree to the amendment,\u201d \u00a7 40-4-219(1)(a), MCA; whether \u201cthe child has been integrated into the family of the petitioner with consent of the parents,\u201d \u00a7 40-4-219(1)(b), MCA; whether \u201cone parent has willfully and consistently ... refused to allow the child to have any contact with the other parent\u201d or \u201cattempted to frustrate or deny contact with the child ...,\u201d \u00a7 40-4-219(l)(d), MCA; and, whether one parent has changed \u201cthe child\u2019s residence in a manner that significantly affects the child\u2019s contact with the other parent,\u201d \u00a7 40-4-219(1)(e), MCA. The Legislature enumerated these specific considerations on equal footing and priority, thus indicating that a child who is 14 years of age is entitled to have his or her wishes considered for purposes of amending a parenting plan. Importantly, \u00a7 40-4-219(1)(c), MCA, which is set forth in a statute dedicated to <em>amending </em>a parenting plan, is distinct from the requirement that the court consider \u201cthe wishes of the child\u201d when determining the child\u2019s best interests at the initial parenting plan proceeding pursuant to \u00a7 40-4-212, MCA. Section 40-4-212(1)(b), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">\u00b619 Section 40-4-220, MCA, provides the procedure for invoking the provisions of \u00a7 40-4-219, MCA. Section 40-4-220(1), MCA, requires that, in the absence of agreement, the party seeking an amendment must file an affidavit setting forth facts supporting the amendment. Here, Chellie gave notice in February 2015 that she wanted to amend the 2013 parenting plan on the basis that R.J.N. was almost 15 years old and H.E.N. was 12 years old, and both wanted to reside primarily with Chellie. At the time the District Court affirmed the Standing Master\u2019s dismissal of Chellie\u2019s petition, R.J.N. was close to 17 years old and H.E.N. was 14 years old. Chellie\u2019s motion was supported by an affidavit indicating that both R.J.N. and H.E.N. wished to amend the parenting plan. No opposing affidavit was filed by William.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">\u00b620 I would conclude that Chellie\u2019s motion and affidavit, together with the express provision of \u00a7 40-4-219(1)(c), MCA, presented \u201cadequate cause for hearing [Chellie\u2019s] motion\u201d and that a hearing on an order to show cause should have been granted. Section 40-4-220(1), MCA. The District Court, however, concluded on the basis of <em>In re Whyte </em>that \u201cdespite R. J.N.\u2019s age and apparent desire to amend the Parenting Plan <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>(even if established at an evidentiary hearing), these facts alone do not constitute a sufficiently changed circumstance warranting a hearing under \u00a7 40-4-220(1), MCA.\u201d The District Court observed that \u201cChellie failed to cite any case, nor has this Court come across any such Montana case in its research, that supports Chellie\u2019s position.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">\u00b621 In my opinion, the provisions of \u00a7 40-4-219(1)(c), MCA, supported Chellie\u2019s request and she did not need to recite authority from this Court to merit further inquiry into her children\u2019s wishes. This Court, however, states it agrees \u201cwith the District Court\u2019s conclusion that such a change [of circumstances] was not demonstrated here\u201d and that \u201cChellie\u2019s pleadings simply noted the children\u2019s current ages and their desire to live primarily with her.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 11. Where no opposing affidavit contests the applicability of \u00a7 40-4-219(1)(c), MCA, or sets forth other facts relevant to the children\u2019s best interests, Chellie has met the threshold inquiry of demonstrating the children desire an amendment and there is adequate cause for a hearing. We are not addressing here whether an amended parenting plan should have been granted; rather, we are deciding whether a hearing should have been ordered because a child 14 years of age or older desired an amendment. Indeed, filed with Chellie\u2019s motion was a request that the court inquire into the children\u2019s wishes in the privacy of the court\u2019s chambers.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">\u00b622 Importantly, the District Court did not base its decision on the findings this Court makes: that the parenting plan was recently revised after substantial litigation; that the children\u2019s wishes were not expressly considered in previous litigation, but their circumstances were extensively assessed; and that Chellie\u2019s assertions appeared to merely return the case to the core issue litigated in 2013. Opinion, \u00b6 11. None of these findings were made or even noted by the District Court. The District Court determined, as a matter of law, that a child who is 14 years of age and desires an amendment has not met the threshold inquiry of demonstrating a substantial change in circumstances. To be more precise, the District Court reviewed the Standing Master\u2019s order dismissing Chellie\u2019s petition for the reasons \u201cset forth in [William\u2019s] Motion and Reply.\u201d I cannot accept that this gave adequate consideration to Chellie\u2019s motion in light of the specific statutory provision requiring an adolescent\u2019s wishes be heard.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-7\">\u00b623 In <em>In re Whyte, </em>a trial court granted a Mother\u2019s motion to amend a parenting plan and this Court reversed. <em>In re Whyte, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 12, 24. The trial court expressly considered the wishes of an eleven year old child and other circumstances in the child\u2019s life. <em>In re Whyte, </em>\u00b6 12. We vacated the amended parenting plan, concluding that the evidence the trial court received was \u201cinsufficient to establish the statutory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>standard for amendment of the parenting plan.\u201d <em>In re Whyte, </em>\u00b6 24. In our analysis of \u00a7 40-4-219(1)(c), MCA, we stated, \u201cI <em>while consideration of the child\u2019s desires is statutorily required when the child is 14 years old, </em>the ultimate decision is for the court to make, based upon the evidence, and cannot be delegated to the child.\u201d <em>In re Whyte, </em>\u00b6 28 (emphasis added). Thus, in <em>In re Whyte </em>we expressly stated that \u00a7 40-4-219(1)(c), MCA, requires a court consider the child\u2019s desires when the child is fourteen years old. We determined the provision did not apply to the parenting plan at issue in <em>In re Whyte </em>because the child was only eleven years old. <em>In re Whyte, </em>\u00b6 28. Here, in contrast, Chellie provided an affidavit that the children, at least one of them older than 14, desired an amendment pursuant to \u00a7 40-4-219(1)(c), MCA. No opposing evidence was presented. It is patently clear that the District Court dismissed the petition on what it believed was a matter of law. Although we add facts to our decision which were not articulated by the District Court so the court\u2019s dismissal might be justified, our conclusion that Chellie has not met her threshold statutory burden conveys to an adolescent that his or her growth, maturity, and desire to direct and take control of his or her own life is not worthy of a hearing and consideration by the court. I am very much opposed to the suggestion that a child\u2019s voice does not merit consideration by a court in a parenting proceeding, particularly when the Legislature has concluded otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">\u00b624 In 1983 the Legislature added what is now \u00a7 40-4-219(1)(c), MCA. SB 371, 48th Leg. (Mont. 1983). The provision, introduced as Senate Bill 371, was titled, \u201cAn Act Providing that if it is in the Best Interest of the Child, a Child Custody Decree May be Modified When a Child Aged 14 Years or Older Desires that it be Modified; Amending Section 40-4-219, MCA.\u201d Proponents of the provision expressed concern that, under the existing statutory framework, a child of appropriate age was disenfranchised from expressing his or her wishes and desires as to a parenting plan amendment. Senate Committee on Judiciary Hearing, Exhibit A, 1 (February 11, 1983). Proponents believed that \u201cour young people have a right to input their desires requesting a custody modification upon a court.\u201d Senate Judiciary Committee Hearing, Exhibit A, 1 (February 11, 1983). The Senate intended the provision to \u201callow a 14-year-old child to express their desires as to which parent they are placed with\u201d without binding the court to the child\u2019s desires. Senate Judiciary Committee Hearing Minutes, 4 (February 15, 1983). The House of Representatives noted that the provision would not permit a child to choose who he or she lived with \u201cas a matter of right,\u201d but instead the provision would allow a judge to take a child\u2019s desire <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>\u201cinto consideration once the child reaches [age 14].\u201d House Judiciary Committee Hearing Minutes, 6 (March 14, 1983). Despite subsequent amendments to \u00a7 40-4-219, MCA, a child of age 14 or older still has the right to express his or her desire for an amended parenting plan pursuant to \u00a7 40-4-219(1)(c), MCA, and we must ensure that right is protected.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">\u00b625 Contested parenting proceedings are hard for everyone\u2014the parents, the family, the witnesses, the court; but most particularly, the children for whom the proceedings are designed to serve and protect. The proceeding should not shut out the voice of the very individual upon which the proceeding is focused. While the court obviously is not required to adopt a parenting plan consistent with the child\u2019s wishes, it is nonetheless important for the child that he or she is heard by the court. Given the contentious nature and substantial amount of litigation in these proceedings, as noted by the Court, it would seem particularly appropriate that the voices and wishes of R.J.N. and H.E.N.\u2014here, two adolescents\u2014be heard, through any means the court deemed appropriate. At least, in such a fashion, they would have the benefit of knowing that their wishes were heard and considered. In my opinion and as explained above, this was what the Legislature contemplated when it allowed for the amendment of a parenting plan to consider the wishes of a child who is 14 years of age or older. Section 40-4-219(l)(c), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">\u00b626 I respectfully dissent from the Court\u2019s decision that Chellie\u2019s motion and uncontroverted affidavit did not establish adequate cause for a hearing.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
