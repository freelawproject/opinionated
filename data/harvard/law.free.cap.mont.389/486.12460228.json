Merlette and Gladys A. Merlette (Merlette) appeal an order of the Montana Eleventh Judicial District Court granting summary judgment declaring that Brenda M. Ash (Ash) owns certain disputed land between the high- and low-water marks of a small lake located in Flathead County, Montana. We affirm and address the following issue on appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-10\">\n<em>Did the District Court correctly conclude that Ash owns the land bordering her property between the high- and low-water marks of Parker Lake?</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b513-13\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b513-14\">\u00b62 In 1986, Larry and Serena Streeter (Streeters) acquired approximately 43 acres of property surrounding a small lake in Flathead County known as Parker Lake No. I.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In 1991, Streeters subdivided the property by internal boundary line relocation into an approximately 5.66 acre tract (Parcel A) and a 37.17 acre remainder (Tract l).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Both tracts included lake frontage on Parker Lake. In 1992, Streeters sold the 37.17 acre remainder to John Bradshaw (Merlette <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>Property)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> but retained the previously created 5.66 acre tract (Ash Property) for themselves. In 2000, Brenda Ash (formerly Olson) jointly acquired the Ash Property with her then-husband via a mesne conveyance originating from Streeters.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">\u00b63 As created and particularly described by Streeters\u2019 1991 COS 10404, the 5.66 acre Ash Property included approximately 577 feet of frontage on Parker Lake. COS 10404 described the Ash Property boundary along Parker Lake by a particularized metes and bounds plot running from a referenced starting point on the high-water mark and then \u201con and along\u201d the high-water mark three specified courses marked by pin locations. Streeters\u2019 subsequent 1992 deed to Bradshaw conveyed the Merlette Property by reference to COS 10120 but expressly excluded the retained Ash Property from the conveyance by reference to COS 10404, which cut the Ash Property out of COS 10120 prior to the Bradshaw conveyance. The 1992 Bradshaw deed expressly excluded the Ash Property by reference to COS 10404 and a redundant metes and bounds description lifted verbatim therefrom. The 2000 Olson-Ash deed (Ash deed) described the Ash Property by reference to COS 10404 and a redundant metes and bounds plot running from a referenced point on the high-water mark \u201con and along\u201d the high-water mark three specified courses, \u201c577 feet more or less.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AWT\">\u00b64 In 2002, construction workers retained by Merlette excavated fill from Parker Lake to level a site for a new residence on the Merlette Property. Ash complained to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers that Merlette\u2019s fill excavation violated \u00a7 404 of the federal Clean Water Act prohibiting unpermitted dredging in streams, lakes, and wetlands subject to the Act.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> After a site visit, the Corps issued correspondence, dated January 21, 2003, declaring Parker Lake as a non-navigable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>intrastate body of water beyond the Corps\u2019 jurisdiction pursuant to <em>Solid Waste Agency v. U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, </em>531 U.S. 159, 121 S. Ct. 675 (2001) (federal jurisdiction limited to waters susceptible to interstate commerce and immediately adjacent wetlands).</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">\u00b65 Later in 2002, Ash placed a boat dock on the Parker Lake shoreline in front of her home. Merlette objected, asserting that he owned all of the land below the high-water mark around the entire lake. He accused Ash of trespass and insisted that she remove the dock immediately. Ash eventually acquiesced and removed the dock. In 2015, Ash again installed a dock on the lake in advance of listing her property for sale. Merlette again protested on the asserted ground that he owned all of the land below the high-water mark around the lake. The dispute escalated when Merlette pounded metal fence posts along the high-water mark bordering Ash\u2019s property and Ash removed and stacked them on Merlette\u2019s driveway.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">\u00b66 After the parties exchanged correspondence through counsel, Ash filed suit on November 12, 2015, asserting claims for declaratory judgment and in tort based on alleged trespass and nuisance. Ash further sought a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction enjoining Merlette from interfering with her lake access pending final judgment. Merlette counterclaimed in trespass, asserting ownership of all land between the high- and low-water marks on the lake. On November 24, 2015, the District Court granted Ash\u2019s request for a temporary restraining order and, following hearing on December 1, 2015, issued a preliminary injunction enjoining Merlette from interfering with Ash\u2019s lake access. On December 28,2016, Ash filed an amended complaint adding counts of intentional interference with her contractual relationship with her realtors and slander of title based on Merlette\u2019s alleged misrepresentations to third parties regarding his asserted ownership of all lake frontage on Parker Lake.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-7\">\u00b67 In January 2016, the parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment. On the ground that extrinsic evidence was not necessary or proper to construe the clear and unambiguous language in Ash\u2019s deed, the District Court denied Merlette\u2019s M. R. Civ. P. 56(f) motion to stay summary judgment and for further discovery. On November 7, 2016, the District Court granted summary judgment that Ash owned the land between the high- and low-water marks of Parker Lake bordering Ash\u2019s property. On February 22, 2017, the District Court certified its summary judgment order for immediate appeal pursuant to M. R. Civ. P. 54(b). We affirm and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">\u00b68 We review summary judgment rulings de novo for conformance to M.

Whether a genuine issue of material fact exists or whether a party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law are conclusions of law subject to de novo review for correctness. <em>Ereth v. Cascade County, </em>2003 MT 328, \u00b6 11, 318 Mont. 355, 81 P.3d 463.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b516-7\">\u00b69 <em>Did the District Court correctly conclude that Ash owns the land bordering her property between the high- and low-water marks of Parker Lake ?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b516-8\">\u00b610 As matters of federal and federally-derived state sovereignty over beds and banks of navigable waters, conveyances of land bordering navigable waters, as defined by federal law, cannot convey title below the high-water mark unless otherwise authorized by state law. <em>See PPL Montana, LLC v. Montana, </em>565 U.S. 576, 589-91, 132 S. Ct. 1215, 1227-28 (2012) (riparian ownership acquired by western states on admission under federal \u201cequal footing\u201d doctrine); <em>Montana v. United States, </em>450 U.S. 544, 551, 101 S. Ct. 1245, 1251 (1981) (ownership of land between the high-water marks of navigable waters generally adhered to the states upon statehood subject only to any retained federal easement and federal constitutional authority to regulate interstate commerce); <em>United States v. Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul &amp; Pac. R.R. Co., </em>312 U.S. 592, 597, 61 S. Ct. 772, 775 (1941) (federal authority to regulate interstate commerce between high-water marks of navigable waters); \u00a7 70-1-202(1), MCA (state owns \u201call land below\u201d water of navigable lakes and streams). Subject to Montana\u2019s limited public trust easement over state waters for fishing and recreational use between the high-water marks, <em>see </em>Mont. Const. art. IX, \u00a7 3; \u00a7\u00a7 23-2-302(1), 70-1-202(1), and 87-2-305, MCA; <em>Galt v. State, </em>225 Mont. 142, 147-48, 731 P.2d 912, 915-16 (1987), parties other than the state may acquire title to the midline of non-navigable waters and to the low-water mark of navigable waters. Section 70-16-201, MCA.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Thus, unless the source instrument of conveyance clearly and unequivocally provides otherwise, conveyances of land bordering on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>non-navigable waters convey title to the underlying land to the midline of the water body, while conveyances of land bordering on navigable waters convey title to the low-water mark. Section 70-16-201, MCA. Since Montana\u2019s public trust easement is not at issue here and a conveyance of land bordering on a water body conveys <em>at least </em>to the low-water mark unless otherwise provided by the conveyance, we need only address whether the District Court correctly construed the pertinent instruments of conveyance without consideration of whether Parker Lake is navigable or non-navigable.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">\u00b611 Other than by operation of law, transfers of real property may occur only by written conveyance expressing the grantor\u2019s intent to convey particularly described property to another. Sections 70-1-501, 70-2-101, and -102, MCA. Except as otherwise provided by law, the language of an instrument of conveyance determines the nature and extent of title conveyed. <em>Anderson v. Stokes, </em>2007 MT 166, \u00b6 32, 338 Mont. 118, 163 P.3d 1273. Conveyance of real property by reference to a certificate of survey, as defined by \u00a7\u00a7 76-3-103(1), -302(1), -401, -402, MCA, incorporates the referenced certificate of survey, including all notes, certifications, lines, descriptions, land marks, and depictions therein, into the deed as if set forth on the face of the deed. <em>John Alexander Ethen Trust Agreement v.

Owens, </em>267 Mont. 279, 283-86, 883 P.2d 817, 820-22 (1994).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The construction of an instrument of conveyance, including the question of whether its terms are vague or ambiguous, is a question of law. <em>Mularoni v. Bing, </em>2001 MT 215, \u00b6 32, 306 Mont. 405, 34 P.3d 497.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">\u00b612 Here, the parties agree with the District Court that the Ash Property lake frontage descriptions in COS 10404 and the Ash deed are consistent, clear, and unambiguous.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> They simply disagree about their meaning. Ash agrees with the District Court that she owns the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>disputed land between the high- and low-water marks of Parker Lake bordering her property based on the presumption of \u00a7 70-16-201, MCA, and the meander line methodology for describing riparian borders. Merlette contrarily asserts that the specific metes and bounds description of the Parker Lake boundary line in the source COS 10404 and the resulting Ash deed expressly limit the property to the high-water mark.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">\u00b613 To the extent lawful and reasonably ascertainable, courts must construe instruments of conveyance to give full effect to the intent of the grantor at the time of the conveyance. <em>Anderson, </em>\u00b6 33. If the language of an instrument of conveyance is clear and unambiguous, the court must construe the instrument based on its express language and incorporated references without resort to extrinsic evidence. Section 70-20-202(1), MCA; <em>Anderson, </em>\u00b6 33; <em>Pilgrim v. Kuipers, </em>209 Mont. 177, 180, 679 P.2d 787, 789 (1984). Extrinsic evidence is a relevant construction aid only if the language of the instrument of conveyance is vague or ambiguous. <em>Anderson, </em>\u00b6 33. The language of a conveyance is ambiguous only if susceptible to two or more conflicting meanings, both of which are objectively reasonable. <em>Mary J. Baker Revocable Trust v. Cenex Harvest States, Co-ops., Inc., </em>2007 MT 159, \u00b6 20, 338 Mont. 41, 164 P.3d 851. Mere disagreement about the meaning of particular terms or provisions does not render otherwise clear and unambiguous language ambiguous. <em>Heggem v. Capitol Indem. Corp., </em>2007 MT 74, \u00b6 30, 336 Mont. 429, 154 P.3d 1189.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">\u00b614 In construing instruments of conveyance, the court may not rely on isolated words or provisions. <em>Anderson, </em>\u00b6 36 <em>(citing Rumph v. Dale Edwards, Inc., </em>183 Mont. 359, 368-69, 600 P.2d 163, 168-69 (1979)). The court must construe an instrument of conveyance in its entirety, giving effect to all within its four corners, and narrowly construing and subordinating any term or provision repugnant to the manifest general intent or purpose of the instrument. <em>Anderson, </em>\u00b6 36. The court must liberally construe express reservations in grants of real property in favor of the grantor. Section 70-1-516, MCA. Except as otherwise expressly provided or necessarily implied from the language of the instrument, a conveyance of real property transfers to the grantee all title and interest then held by the grantor. Section 70-1-519, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"AINd\">\u00b615 Essential to this case is the well-settled methodology for surveying and describing riparian boundaries. Congressional acts from 1785 into the early 1800s required official government surveys to subdivide all territories acquired by the United States north of the Ohio River and west of the Mississippi River (except Texas) into six-mile square <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>townships, composed of 36 square-mile sections containing 640 acres each. <em>Yellowstone River, LLC v. Meriwether Land Fund I, LLC, </em>2011 MT 263, \u00b6 6, 362 Mont. 273, 264 P.3d 1065 (citing Joyce Palomar, <em>Patton and Palomar on Land Titles </em>vol. 1, \u00a7 116 (3d ed. 2003) and Curtis M. Brown, Walter G. Robillard, &amp; Donald A. Wilson, <em>Evidence and Procedures for Boundary Location </em>179-200 (2ded. 1981)). <em>See also </em>Curtis M. Brown, Walter G.

Wilson, <em>Brown\u2019s Boundary Control and Legal Principles (Brown\u2019s) </em>\u00a7 6 (6th ed. 2009) (discussing the development of the Public Land Survey (PLS) system).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Where a true section or quarter-section corner would otherwise be located in \u201ca water course,\u201d the PLS system required official government surveyors to run the converging straight section lines from the other \u201cestablished corners ... to the [edge of the] water course,\u201d thereby establishing \u201cfractional townships\u201d with the water course \u201cdesignated as the <em>external boundary </em>of the fractional township.\u201d <em>Schurmeir v. St. Paul &amp; P. RR. Co., </em>10 Minn. 82, 99-100 (Minn. 1865) (emphasis original) (citing 2 Stat. 313, 314 (1805) (construing Land Act of February 11, 1805, <em>in re </em>mode of surveying U.S. public lands). The PLS system thus required \u201can accurate survey of the meanderings of a water course\u201d serving as external boundary of fractional townships by reference to a \u201cmeander line,\u201d <em>i.e., </em>a \u201cline showing the place of the water course and its sinuosities, courses, and distances.\u201d <em>Schurmeir, </em>10 Minn. at 100. <em>Accord </em>Alan C. Morganfield &amp; Charles Carpenter, The Ins and Outs (and Zigs and Zags) of Legal Descriptions, 102A Rocky Mtn. Min. L. Spec. Inst. 11, 49-51 (1998). Though originally applicable by federal statute only to lands surveyed and conveyed by the federal government, the PLS system meander line methodology became a generally accepted professional standard and practice for surveying and describing public and private lands bounded by water bodies. <em>See Brown\u2019s </em>\u00a7 1.2.</p>\n<p id=\"AEMR\">\u00b616  Consistent with this generally accepted standard and practice, a federal and state common law rule soon developed that, unless the language of a conveyance clearly and unequivocally manifests a more limited intent to fix a riparian boundary to the precise course specified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>in a property description, a riparian boundary<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> specified or depicted in an instrument of conveyance, or incorporated survey or plat map, is merely a meander line, <em>i.e., a mere approximation of </em>the ever-fluctuating and meandering edge of a water body intended as <em>the actual boundary line </em>of the property. <em>Andersen v.

Except as otherwise clearly provided in the language of conveyance, a meander line merely approximates \u201cthe border-line of the stream\u201d and signifies that the water course is the actual boundary rather than \u201cthe meander line ... run on the land.\u201d <em>St. Paul &amp; Pac.

Co.); North Shore, </em>530 N.W.2d at 302-03. Consequently, unless otherwise unequivocally provided on the face of the instrument, an instrument of conveyance describing a riparian boundary by reference to a particularized metes and bounds description, <em>i.e., </em>a meander line, conveys title at least to the low-water mark of the body of water rather than the line precisely described by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>metes and bounds. <em>Monforton, </em>\u00b6 22 (synthesizing meander line methodology with \u00a7 70-16-201, MCA); <em>Faucett, </em>82 Mont. at 257, 266 P. at 648.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">\u00b617 In <em>Monforton, </em>a residential developer acquired and subdivided a large ranch property bordering on the Jefferson River in Madison County. <em>Monforton, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 7-8. The source 1971 warranty deed to the developer, as well as the subsequent subdivision plat in reference to which the developer conveyed subdivision lots to third parties, described the property boundary along the Jefferson River by reference to a point on the bank of the river and then \u201cmeandering the right bank\u201d along a series of specified courses that corresponded to the high-water mark. <em>Monforton, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 10, 13. Years later, a subsequent owner, who acquired the undeveloped remainder of the original ranch property from the developer, sued river lot owners for declaratory judgment that the river boundary specified in the developer\u2019s source warranty deed, as carried forward in the subsequent subdivision plat and resulting lot deeds, specifically established the high-water mark as the actual boundary of the subdivision lots contrary to the presumption of \u00a7 70-16-201, MCA. <em>Monforton, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 9-14. The plaintiff thus asserted that owners of subdivision river lots had no river access because he owned the 11.4-acre strip between the high- and low-water marks along the subdivision boundary.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">\u00b618 After recognizing the long-settled meander line methodology for describing riparian boundaries and the common law presumption codified in \u00a7 70-16-201, MCA,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> we rejected the plaintiff s assertion that the meander line methodology applies only to the official federal government land surveys from which it arose. <em>Monforton, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 18-24. Based on the presumption of \u00a7 70-16-201, MCA, the nature and purpose of meander lines, and an express reference to the described boundary as \u201cmeandering\u201d along the river, we held that the specific metes and bounds description of the riparian boundary, which included references to monumental and non-monumental marks, was insufficient alone to \u201cindicate an intent contrary to\u201d the \u201clow-water line\u201d presumption of \u00a7 70-16-201, MCA. <em>Monforton, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 26-29. We so held notwithstanding that the metes and bounds description referenced and ran along the high-water mark, the existence of contrary extrinsic evidence, and that the river lot owners had not paid taxes on the adjoining property between the high- and low-water <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>marks. <em>Monforton, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 26-29.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">\u00b619 Similarly here, the parties do not dispute that their source common grantor (Streeters) owned at least to the low-water mark of Parker Lake.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The parties affirmatively agree that the Ash Property lake frontage descriptions in COS 10404 and the Ash deed are consistent, clear, and unambiguous. Mere disagreement about the meaning of the otherwise clear and unambiguous metes and bounds descriptions in COS 10404 and the Ash deed is insufficient to render those instruments ambiguous. <em>Heggem, </em>\u00b6 30.</p>\n<p id=\"adu-dedup-1\">\u00b620  While the descriptions in COS 10404 and the Ash deed do not use any form of the term \u201cmeander\u201d to describe the property boundary along Parker Lake, express reference or use of the term \u201cmeander\u201d in an instrument of conveyance is not talismanic. By nature, water bodies meander and their boundaries are meandering. <em>See, e.g., Faucett, </em>82 Mont. at 257-58, 266 P. at 648; <em>St. Paul &amp; Pac.

With or without express reference to the term \u201cmeander,\u201d a metes and bounds description that plots a varying course, using specific measured distances running from precisely referenced points, to plot an otherwise non-uniform edge of a water body is an approximate meander line unless otherwise clearly provided in the instrument of conveyance. <em>Monforton, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 20-21.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-7\">\u00b621 Unlike other particularized metes and bounds descriptions intended to establish stationary boundary lines on the ground, the purpose of a particularized metes and bounds description along a water body is to provide a reasonably precise approximation of an ever-varying course along the non-stationary and non-uniform edge of the water body. <em>Monforton, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 20-24. The particularized approximation permits a reasonably precise description of the location and quantity of land bought or sold with the understanding that the actual boundary and quantity of the land varies with the fluctuating, meandering water line of the lake or stream. <em>Monforton, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 20-24. In turn, the meander line methodology of approximating riparian boundaries is consistent with the default rule of \u00a7 70-16-201, MCA, that the party who owns property to the high-water mark of a navigable or non-navigable body of water also owns the adjoining property between the high- and low-water marks unless the source instrument of conveyance provides otherwise. <em>Monforton, </em>\u00b6 25. Due to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>the inherent difficulty in describing a naturally meandering water body by uniform measurements, a conveyance of riparian property by reference to a specific metes and bounds description along the high-water mark is insufficient alone to overcome the presumption of \u00a7 70-16-201, MCA, that the grantee takes at least to the low-water mark. <em>Monforton, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 26-29.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> <em>See also </em>\u00a7 70-1-519, MCA (conveyance of real property conveys all title held by the grantor in the subject property unless otherwise clearly provided by the instrument of conveyance).</p>\n<p id=\"ADlt\">\u00b622  As in <em>Monforton, </em>the metes and bounds descriptions of the Parker Lake frontage in COS 10404 and the resulting Ash deed are unquestionably meander line descriptions, <em>i.e., </em>particularized metes and bounds plots approximately corresponding to the otherwise non-uniform edge of a meandering water body. Aside from express references to specific metes and bounds courses along the high-water mark, nothing in COS 10404 or the resulting Ash deed indicate any intent of the parties\u2019 common grantors (Streeters) to strip themselves, or successors, of the grantors\u2019 preexisting ownership of the land between the high- and low-water marks of Parker Lake along the Ash Property.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Thus, in accordance with the presumption of \u00a7\u00a7 70-1-519 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>and 70-16-201, MCA, Streeters retained ownership of the land between the high- and low-water marks along the Ash Property in COS 10404, which then carried forward to Ash under a successive conveyance referencing COS 10404 without limitation. Merlette never acquired title to the land between the high- and low-water marks along the Ash Property because the source description of the property in COS 10404 was insufficient to separate the adjoining land below the high-water mark and the subsequent deed from Streeters to Bradshaw expressly excluded the Ash Property from the conveyance of the Merlette Property. Bradshaw simply never owned the disputed land below the high-water mark to convey to Merlette even if he had intended to do so.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Despite express reference to the high-water mark, the specific metes and bounds description of the riparian boundary of the Ash Property in COS 10404, as carried forward and repeated in substance in the Ash deed, was a meander line establishing the riparian boundary of the Ash Property at least to the low-water mark of Parker Lake pursuant to \u00a7 70-16-201, MCA. We hold that the District Court correctly granted summary judgment declaring that the Ash Property includes, and thus Ash owns, the disputed land between the high- and low-water marks of Parker Lake.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">\u00b623 The specific metes and bounds description of the riparian boundary of the Ash Property in COS 10404, as carried forward and repeated in substance in the Ash deed, was a meander line description establishing the riparian boundary of the Ash Property at least to the low-water mark of Parker Lake.
