(Fairlawn) as a result of a sewer pipeline break. The break occurred under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>the Passaic River, 385 feet from Fairlawn\u2019s property line. The insurance policy issued by Gerling covered Fairlawn\u2019s \u201cDescribed Premises or on land within 1,000 feet thereof.\u201d Gerling argues that no coverage is provided under the policy because Fairlawn\u2019s loss did not occur on \u201cland.\u201d We disagree. In our view, a reasonable insured would expect that the Passaic River bed constituted \u201cland\u201d despite the fact that the river bed was covered with water. We therefore affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b146-4\">Considering the evidentiary material in a light most favorable to plaintiff, <em>Brill v. Guardian Life Ins. Co. of Am., </em>142 <em>N.J. </em>520, 523, 666 A.2d 146 (1995), these are the facts. Fairlawn owns an industrial complex on the banks of the Passaic River. It leases buildings to various industrial users and maintains a pumping station on the complex which disposes waste generated by the industrial tenants. The station collects and pumps industrial and human waste through a pipeline which extends underneath the Fairlawn property, traverses the riverbed of the Passaic River, and continues underground on the opposite side of the Passaic River where it connects with the interceptor line of the Passaic Valley Sewage Authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">In April 1995, Fairlawn learned of a break in the pipeline, occurring approximately 385 feet away from its property line, discharging waste water into the Passaic River. Fairlawn immediately retained a contractor and engineer to repair the break and submitted an insurance claim to Gerling seeking coverage for the damages incurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">Fairlawn was insured under a \u201cComprehensive All Risk Form\u201d insurance policy. The critical policy provision defined property covered under the policy as \u201cproperty designated on the Schedule of Locations, all while situated on Described Premises or on land within 1,000 feet thereof.\u201d The \u201cSchedule of Locations\u201d identified Fairlawn\u2019s premises as a covered property under the policy. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>However, the term \u201con land within 1,000 feet\u201d was not defined within the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">Gerling denied Fairlawn\u2019s claim for insurance coverage, claiming that the damaged pipeline was not on \u201cland\u201d within 1,000 feet of the premises because the break occurred under the Passaic River. Fairlawn filed suit. The motion judge determined that it was within the reasonable expectation of Fairlawn that the insurance coverage under Gerling\u2019s comprehensive \u201call risk\u201d policy encompassed Fairlawn\u2019s entire physical premises and operation including the pipeline crossing the Passaic River.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">It is well-settled that insurance policies are contracts of adhesion and, as such, are subject to special rules of interpretation. <em>Longobardi v. Chubb Ins. Co. of New Jersey, </em>121 <em>N.J. </em>530, 537, 582 A.2d 1257 (1990). Insurance companies employ varied, highly technical and complex instruments with language which is often obscure to the layman and extremely difficult to understand. <em>Sparks v. St. Paul Ins. Co., </em>100 <em>N.J. </em>325, 335, 495 A.2d 406 (1985); <em>Allen v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., </em>44 <em>N.J. </em>294, 302, 208 A.2d 638 (1965). Thus, courts interpreting insurance policies must \u201c \u2018assume a particularly vigilant role in ensuring their conformity to public policy and principles of fairness.\u2019 \u201d <em>Gibson v. Callaghan, </em>158 <em>N.J. </em>662, 669-70, 730 A.2d 1278 (1999) (quoting <em>Voorhees v. Preferred Mut. Ins. Co., </em>128 <em>N.J. </em>165, 175, 607 A.2d 1255 (1992)).</p>\n<p id=\"b147-7\">Generally, the words of an insurance policy are to be given their plain and ordinary meaning. <em>Voorhees, supra, </em>128 <em>N.J. </em>at 175, 607 A.2d 1255; <em>Longobardi, supra, </em>121 <em>N.J. </em>at 537, 582 A.2d 1257. When the terms of a policy are clear, the court\u2019s function is to enforce the written contract and \u201c \u2018should not write for the insured a better policy of insurance than the one purchased.\u2019 \u201d <em>Longobardi, supra, </em>121 <em>N.J. </em>at 537, 582 A.2d 1257 (quoting <em>Walker Rogge, Inc. v. Chelsea Title &amp; Guar. Co., </em>116 <em>N.J. </em>517, 529, 562 A.2d 208 (1989)). However, ambiguities in an insurance policy are to be resolved in favor of the insured. <em>Voorhees, supra, </em>128 <em>N.J. </em>at 175, 607 A.2d 1255. Since insurance companies are the parties who produce the binding documents, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>consideration should be given to the fact that more precise language could have been utilized to \u201cput the matter beyond legal question.\u201d <em>Gibson, supra, </em>158 <em>N.J. </em>at 672, 730 A.2d 1278.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\">Further, insurance policies are construed to effectuate the reasonable expectations of the insured. <em>Id. </em>at 671, 730 A.2d 1278; <em>Werner Indus., Inc. v. First State Ins. Co., </em>112 <em>N.J. </em>30, 35-36, 548 A.2d 188 (1988). Thus, in the absence of a specific definition in a policy, <em>Crest-Foam Corp. v. Aetna Ins. Co., </em>320 <em>N.J.Super. </em>509, 519, 727 A.2d 1030 (App.Div.1999), or when the meaning of a phrase in a policy is ambiguous, <em>Voorhees, supra, </em>128 <em>N.J. </em>at 174, 607 A.2d 1255, courts must resolve the dispute in line with the insured\u2019s objectively reasonable expectations. Moreover, even a simple term, which seems clear and unambiguous, may be enforced contrary to its plain meaning to fulfill the reasonable expectations of the insured. <em>Gibson, supra, </em>158 <em>N.J. </em>at 671, 730 A.2d 1278.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">Here, it is undisputed that the broken pipeline rested on the riverbed of the Passaic River, approximately 385 feet away from Fairlawn\u2019s property line. Therefore, it is clear Fairlawn\u2019s loss occurred within 1,000 feet of its property. The only question is whether the loss occurred \u201con land\u201d within the confines of the insurance policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">New Jersey case law has recognized that the term \u201cland\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-7\">includes water, and this understanding seems to be supported by abundant authority. The word \u2018land,\u2019 ... includes, not only the naked earth, but everything within it, and the buildings, trees, fixtures, fences, stones, minerals, water, and herbage upon it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-8\"><em>[Philadelphia Trust, Safe Deposit &amp; Ins. Co. v. Mayor, Etc., of Borough of Merchantville, </em>74 <em>N.J.Eq. </em>330, 332, 69 A. 729 (1908) (emphasis added defining the term \u201cland\u201d when used in the context of a deed).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b148-9\">\u201cThe word \u2018land\u2019 is comprehensive in its import, and includes many things besides the earth we tread on, as water, grass, buildings, fences, trees, and the like,\u201d concluding that \u201call these may be conveyed by the general designation of \u2018land.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>In <em>Wynn v. Margate City, </em>9 <em>N.J. Misc. </em>1324, 1326, 157 <em>A. </em>565 (Sup.Ct.1931), the court held that the term \u201cland,\u201d as used in a zoning ordinance, included land covered by water, and in <em>Bruno v. Long Branch, </em>21 <em>N.J. </em>68, 72, 120 A.2d 760 (1956), the court held that \u201cthe term \u2018lands\u2019 is, in the law, a word of art ... [which] includes ... not only the soil, but everything attached to it ... by the hand of man....\u201d Thus, an object annexed to the land, even if underwater, would be legally comprehended within the meaning of the word \u2018land.\u2019 <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">We are convinced that the reasonable expectation of an insured is that coverage under the Gerling policy would be offered consistent with this comprehensive case-law definition of the words \u201con land.\u201d The pipeline was an essential component of Fairlawn\u2019s complex and operation. Given the fact that the policy provided coverage for losses suffered within 1,000 feet of the complex, Fairlawn would reasonably assume that the pipeline from the pumping station connecting to an off-site piping system would be covered, provided that the loss occurred within 1,000 feet of its property. It is illogical to conclude that coverage would be afforded if the pipeline break occurred on Fairlawn\u2019s property or on the dry land of the far bank of the Passaic River, within 1,000 feet of Fairlawn\u2019s property, but not if the break occurs in the connecting pipeline on the river bed between these points, simply because the river bed was covered by water.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b146-7\"> After the order for summary judgment was entered in Fairlawn's favor, the trial court awarded Fairlawn $423,944.36 in damages after a bench trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
