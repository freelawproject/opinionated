Most significantly, this appeal raises the novel issues of whether gender dysphoria or transsexualism is a handicap under the New Jersey Law Against Discrimination, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>10:5-1 through -49 (\u201cLAD\u201d), and whether the LAD precludes an employer from discriminating on the basis of someone\u2019s sexual identity or gender. We answer both questions in the affirmative and reverse and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-11\">We recount only those portions of the procedural history and facts necessary to explain our resolution of the issues raised in these consolidated appeals. Plaintiff was born a biological male and, until February 1998, was legally known as \u201cCarlos.\u201d Plaintiff is a licensed New Jersey physician who was in the private practice of general and developmental pediatrics from 1974 to 1995.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-12\">On November 20, 1995, defendant West Jersey Health Systems (\u201cWest Jersey\u201d) hired plaintiff as medical director of defendant outpatient treatment facility, West Jersey Center for Behavior, Learning and Attention (\u201cCenter\u201d). Plaintiff and West Jersey <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>entered into a written Professional Services Agreement that could be terminated by either party upon ninety days\u2019 written notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">In September 1996, less than a year after plaintiffs employment with West Jersey commenced, she began the external transformation from male to female. Plaintiff shaved her beard and eventually removed all vestiges of facial hair. She sculpted and waxed her eyebrows, pierced her ears, started wearing emerald stone earrings, and began growing breasts.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">In the early months of 1997, plaintiff was confronted by defendants John Cossa, Maureen Miller, and Ellen Feinstein regarding their discomfort over her transformation. Cossa was West Jersey\u2019s vice president and president and chief executive officer of defendant West Jersey Clinical Association, also known as defendant West Jersey Physicians\u2019 Associates (\u201cPhysicians\u2019 Associates\u201d), the entity which assumed control of the Center\u2019s professional staff in September 1997. Miller was vice president of outpatient services at West Jersey and Feinstein was her assistant.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-7\">By February 1997, plaintiff began manicuring and polishing her nails, growing long hair, and wearing a ponytail. On February 13, 1997, Cossa expressly questioned plaintiff about her appearance. According to plaintiff, Cossa asked if plaintiff would be willing to go back to her prior appearance if West Jersey asked her to. Cossa told plaintiff, \u201cstop all this and go back to your previous appearance!\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b536-8\">In June 1997, plaintiff was diagnosed with gender dysphoria, which is a gender identity disorder listed in the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, </em>(fourth edition, <em>1994)(\u201cDSM-IV\u201d), </em>published by the American Psychiatric Association. This disorder is also known as transsexualism.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-9\">On July 22, 1997, plaintiff received a letter from Miller stating that the hospital, pursuant to the professional services agreement, was terminating the agreement, without cause, effective in ninety days, on October 22, 1997. According to this letter, the Center\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>program was being assumed by Physicians\u2019 Associates as of the end of October. Plaintiff was advised that she would be contacted by Cossa to discuss a new contract with that entity.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">From July 22 to September 29, 1997, plaintiff repeatedly tried to discuss a new contract with Cossa, without any success. Plaintiff claimed that as of September 1997, all of the other professional staff employed at the Center had become employees of Physicians\u2019 Associates.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-7\">On September 29, 1997, when plaintiff finally met with Cossa regarding a new contract for plaintiff, Cossa advised plaintiff that \u201c[N]o one\u2019s going to sign this contract unless you stop this business that you\u2019re doing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b537-8\">When Cossa and plaintiff next met, on October 13, plaintiff presented Cossa with a letter she had drafted to her family and patients, explaining her gender identity disorder and the treatment she was following. She had not yet sent the letter to anyone. Cossa asked plaintiff not to say anything yet and to let Cossa try to work things out.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-9\">On October 22,1997, Cossa handed plaintiff a termination letter. According to this letter, Cossa and plaintiff had discussed the possibility of moving plaintiff to Physicians\u2019 Associates. However, defendants decided not to pursue that option and had made arrangements for other doctors to be available immediately to provide care to the Center\u2019s patients.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-10\">Cossa told plaintiff that the hospital would not allow plaintiff to send her proposed letter to the patients, and that the hospital had drafted a different letter. Plaintiff was also told not to return to the office for the rest of that day and that her patients had been canceled for the next three months.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-11\">In February 1998, plaintiff legally changed her name to Carla. In July 1998, approximately nine months after she was terminated, plaintiff underwent the surgical procedure to become a female. Plaintiff stated that while she was a man, she was not gay and was not sexually attracted to other men. No one at West Jersey ever <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>accused plaintiff of being gay. Since her surgery, plaintiff has continued to live as a \u201cspouse\u201d with Monica, to whom plaintiff was married while she was a man. Plaintiff believes, according to her deposition testimony, that Monica is a lesbian. Plaintiff believes that the course of treatment she began, that ended with sex reassignment surgery, cured her gender dysphoria.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">In December 1998, plaintiff filed her first complaint against defendants for disability discrimination under the LAD, gender or sexual orientation-affection discrimination under the LAD, breach of contract, and trade libel. The West Jersey defendants filed a motion for partial summary judgment, seeking dismissal of plaintiffs claim for disability discrimination. The motion judge granted defendant\u2019s motion, noting that other courts had concluded that transsexualism was not a recognized mental or physical disability under statutes very similar to ours.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">Thereafter, all defendants moved for summary judgment seeking dismissal of the remainder of plaintiffs claims. Before these motions could be heard, plaintiff filed a separately docketed complaint on October 21, 1999, naming the same defendants and reciting the same factual allegations. This complaint, however, alleged causes of action for intentional interference with a contractual relationship, conspiracy, wrongful refusal to continue a business, and unjust enrichment.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-7\">In dealing with the summary judgment motions made by all defendants regarding the remaining counts of plaintiffs first complaint, the motion judge found that plaintiff could not bring a claim for sexual orientation discrimination because plaintiff admitted that, while she was a male, she was not gay and was never accused of being gay. The judge did not believe that the Legislature has provided any remedy for persons who elected to change their sex.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-8\">The judge dismissed the breach of contract claim on the ground that plaintiffs employment contract contained a ninety-day termination provision. With regard to the trade libel claim, the judge noted that plaintiff had refused to identify those patients she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>claimed had been told by defendants that something was wrong with plaintiff and that plaintiff was no longer practicing medicine. The judge acknowledged that plaintiff had submitted two affidavits in opposition to summary judgment, but did not comment on whether these affidavits would alter his decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">The affidavits that plaintiff had submitted in opposition to the summary judgment motion were from the parents of two patients. According to one parent, after plaintiffs termination, West Jersey told her that they had no idea where plaintiff was. The parent was also told that plaintiff might have stopped practicing medicine and that the parent should look for a new doctor for her child.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-7\">The affidavit from the other parent was similar. In addition to telling this parent that they had no idea where plaintiff went, defendants also said that plaintiff was going through some personal issues and would probably not be practicing medicine anymore.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-8\">In February 2000, all defendants moved for a summary judgment dismissal of plaintiffs second complaint. In granting these motions, a different motion judge concluded that the second complaint was a \u201crepackaging\u201d of the first complaint, which had been dismissed by the first motion judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-9\">Plaintiff appealed from the summary judgments dismissing the two complaints, and we consolidated the two appeals. In addition to contesting the dismissal of the entire first complaint, only two of the causes of action alleged by plaintiff in the second complaint, interference with economic opportunity and unjust enrichment, are being challenged in the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-11\">We first detail what the record discloses concerning plaintiffs gender dysphoria or transsexualism. Essentially, plaintiff claimed that she felt like a woman trapped in a man\u2019s body from a very early age, and that she was called upon to act manly even though she did not feel masculine. This is consistent with general clinical findings regarding other transsexuals. \u201cTranssexuals do not al<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>ternate between gender roles; rather, they assume a fixed role of attitudes, feelings, fantasies, and choices consonant with those of the opposite sex, all of which clearly date back to early development.\u201d <em>Current Medical Diagnosis &amp; Treatment </em>928 (Lawrence M. Tierney, Jr. et al. eds., 35th ed.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b540-4\">Though plaintiff is a physician, she did not diagnose herself. Dr. William Stayton from the University of Pennsylvania formally diagnosed plaintiffs condition. Plaintiff claims Dr. Stayton is an \u201cinternationally renowned expert in gender and sexual medicine.\u201d According to the letter plaintiff wanted to send her patients explaining her situation, there are \u201cinternationally accepted norms for treatment of this condition.\u201d These encompass the steps that plaintiff went through including \u201cextensive psychological counseling, extended planning for \u2018transition,\u2019 the use of contrahormonal therapy, hair removal, living in the putative gender role full time (the so called \u2018Real Life Test\u2019) and finally, in some cases, sex reassignment surgery.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">Also in the letter she planned to send her patients, plaintiff further explained gender dysphoria in this fashion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-6\">Current research tells us that early in fetal development, the infant\u2019s brain undergoes masculinization or feminization unrelated to chromosomal complement. Later, as we grow up, we identify with the \u2018cortical\u2019 or brain gender we were endowed with. Happily, for the majority of the population, the genetic (or chromosomal gender) and the cortical (or brain gender) are congruent. Later in development, we develop sexual preferences, sexual orientation, gender attribution, and gender function. Again, in the majority of the population, all of these are congruent and society and the individual are happy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AEh\">But some people do not have this harmony. We call these feelings \u2018dysphoria\u2019 in medicine. Literally, this means \u2018unhappy,\u2019 but doctors have expanded its meaning to describe conditions that significantly effect the individual. Gender Dysphoria describes a condition in which there is not this harmony. The physical and the inner selves are at odds.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b540-8\">Plaintiff argues that the court erred in dismissing her claim of discrimination based on either gender or sexual orientation/affeetion. The LAD provides in pertinent part that it is unlawful for an employer to terminate someone\u2019s employment based on that person\u2019s \u201caffectional or sexual orientation, genetic information, sex or atypical hereditary cellular or blood trait,\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>10:5-12(a). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>The part of the LAD dealing with \u201caffeetional or sexual orientation\u201d was added by the Legislature in 1992. <em>L. </em>1991, c. 519, \u00a7 8, effective January 19, 1992.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">\u201c \u2018Affeetional or sexual orientation\u2019 means male or female heterosexuality, homosexuality or bisexuality by inclination, practice, identity or expression, having a history thereof or being perceived, presumed or identified by others as having such an orientation.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>10:5-5(hh). \u201cHeterosexuality\u201d is defined as affeetional, emotional or physical attraction or behavior primarily directed towards persons of the other gender, \u201chomosexuality\u201d is directed towards persons of the same gender, and \u201cbisexuality\u201d is directed towards persons of either gender. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>10:5 \u2014 5(ii)\u2014(kk).</p>\n<p id=\"b541-7\">We conclude that plaintiff failed to establish a <em>prima facie </em>case for discrimination based on her affeetional or sexual orientation because she was not a homosexual or bisexual or perceived to be homosexual or bisexual. This portion of the statute refers to one\u2019s relations with others and not to his or her own sexual identity, and plaintiff presented no evidence that she was discriminated against because of her \u201caffeetional, emotional or physical attraction\u201d to others.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-8\">Plaintiff\u2019s complaint, however, also included a claim for gender discrimination. Plaintiff specifically charged that her \u201csexual affectation and/or orientation and/or gender, real or as perceived by the defendants was and is a determining factor in connection with defendants ongoing discriminatory, retaliatory and harassing treatment of Plaintiff.\u201d Thus, we proceed to consider whether plaintiff has set forth a viable LAD cause of action based on her gender.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-9\">We note preliminarily that the LAD bars discrimination on the basis of \u201csex\u201d and gender is not specifically mentioned in the law. \u201cSex\u201d is generally understood to mean \u201cwhether a person is anatomically male or female.\u201d Taylor Flynn, <em>Transforming the Debate: Why We Need to Include Transgender Rights in the Struggles for Sex and Sexual Orientation Equality, </em>101 <em>Colum. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number><em>L.Rev. </em>392, 394 (2001). Gender is \u201cwhether a person has qualities that society considers masculine or feminine.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\">Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 2000e-2(a)(1), does not contain language barring discrimination based on one\u2019s affectional or sexual orientation. Moreover, the federal courts construing Title VII have unanimously concluded that discrimination on the basis of gender dysphoria is not sex discrimination. Basically, the federal courts conclude that discrimination on the basis of sex outlaws discrimination against women because they are women, and against men because they are men. <em>E.g., Ulane v. E. Airlines, Inc., </em>742 F.2d 1081, 1085 (7th Cir.1984), <em>cert. denied, </em>471 <em>U.S. </em>1017, 105 <em>S.Ct. </em>2023, 85 L.Ed.2d 304 (1985); <em>Sommers v. Budget Mktg., Inc., </em>667 F.2d 748, 750 (8th Cir.1982); <em>Holloway v. Arthur Andersen &amp; Co., </em>566 F.2d 659, 662-63 (9th Cir.1977); <em>Grossman v. Bernards Tp. Bd. of Educ., </em>11 <em>Fair Empl. Prac. Cas. (BNA) </em>1196 (D.N.J.1975), <em>aff'd, </em>538 F.2d 319 (3d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>429 <em>U.S. </em>897, 97 <em>S.Ct. </em>261, 50 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>181 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">In 1989, however, the United States Supreme Court signaled a possible change in the federal approach to gender dysphoria. In <em>Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins, </em>490 <em>U.S. </em>228, 109 <em>S.Ct. </em>1775, 104 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>268 (1989), the Court held that Title VII barred discrimination of a woman who failed to \u201cact like a woman\u201d or to conform to socially-constructed gender expectations. This approach would seem to indicate that the word \u201csex\u201d in Title VII encompasses both gender and sex, and forbids discrimination because of one\u2019s failure to act in a way expected of a man or a woman. <em>Schwenk v. Hartford, </em>204 F.3d 1187, 1201-02 (9th Cir.2000). The United States Supreme Court has stated that Congress, in barring discrimination based on sex, \u201cintended to strike at the entire spectrum of disparate treatment of men and women resulting from sex stereotypes.\u201d <em>Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins, supra, </em>490 <em>U.S. </em>at 251, 109 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1791, 104 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 288 (citation omitted). Again, as further evidence of this change in approach, <em>Rosa v. Park West Bank &amp; Trust Co., </em>214 F.3d 213 (1st Cir.2000), found under the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, 15 <em>U.S.C. </em>\u00a7 1691 (1994), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>that discrimination against a man because he was wearing a dress could constitute sex discrimination. <em>Id. </em>at 214.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">The states are split on this issue. For example, in <em>Sommers v. Iowa Civil Rights Comm\u2019n, </em>337 N.W.2d 470, 474 (Iowa 1983), the Iowa Supreme Court concluded that the word \u201csex\u201d in Iowa\u2019s Civil Eights Act did not include transsexuals and that sexual discrimination was intended to prohibit conduct which, had the victim been a member of the opposite sex, would not have otherwise occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-7\">Similarly, in <em>James v. Ranch Mart Hardware, Inc., </em>881 <em>F.Supp. </em>478, 481, n. 4 (D.Kan.1995) (applying Kansas law), the federal court held that under the Kansas Act Against Discrimination, a male-to-female transsexual could not sue for discrimination. Moreover, because male employees constituted the \u201cmajority,\u201d the plaintiff had to prove a case of \u201creverse\u201d discrimination, that is, that her employer was the rare employer who discriminated against the majority. <em>Id. </em>at 481.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-8\">In <em>Underwood v. Archer Mgmt. Servs., Inc., </em>857 <em>F.Supp. </em>96, 98 (D.D.C.1994), the court, applying local federal law, held that \u201csex\u201d in the District of Columbia\u2019s Human Rights Act did not include transsexuality because the District\u2019s Commission on Human Rights had defined the term to mean the state of being male or female and the conditions associated therewith. Moreover, although the statute also included a prohibition against sexual orientation discrimination, transsexuality was not the same thing as homosexuality, and the complaint had been devoid of any reference to plaintiffs sexual orientation. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b543-9\">We disagree with the rationale of these decisions. A person who is discriminated against because he changes his gender from male to female is being discriminated against because he or she is a member of a very small minority whose condition remains incomprehensible to most individuals. The view of sex discrimination reflected in these decisions is too constricted.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-10\">Rather, we believe that the New York case <em>Maffei v. Kolaeton Indus., Inc., </em>164 Misc.2d 547, 626 N.Y.S.2d 391 (Sup.Ct.1995), is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>better reasoned. In <em>Maffei, </em>a state law prohibited sex discrimination and a city law also prohibited sexual orientation discrimination. <em>Id. </em>at 392. The court agreed with the reasoning of <em>Underwood </em>that sexual orientation discrimination did not apply to a transsexual because such discrimination dealt only with the sex of the person\u2019s sexual partner. <em>Id. </em>at 393.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">However, in concluding that discrimination against a transsexual constituted sex discrimination, the New York court held that the contrary holdings of the federal courts under Title VII were unduly restrictive and should not be followed in interpreting state and local statutes. <em>Id. </em>at 394-95. Although the city statute used the term \u201cgender\u201d whereas the state statute used the term \u201csex,\u201d the court held that harassment based on the fact an employee changed his sexual status also constituted sex discrimination. <em>Id. </em>at 395-96. Such behavior was similar to harassment based on one\u2019s secondary sexual characteristics. <em>Id. </em>at 396.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">The Minnesota Human Rights Act is unique because it is one of the only state statutes to include in its definition of sexual orientation, \u201chaving or being perceived as having ... a self-image or identity not traditionally associated with one\u2019s biological maleness or femaleness.\u201d <em>Minn.Stat. </em>\u00a7 363.01, subd. 45 (added by <em>L. </em>1993, c. 22, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 2). In <em>Goins v. West Group, </em>619 N.W.2d 424, 428 (Minn.Ct.App.2000), this statute was held to include within its protected class an individual who was born male, who changed her legal name to that of a female, and who took female hormones to identify herself as a female, even though she elected not to undergo sexual reassignment surgery. <em>Id. </em>at 426, 428.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-7\">We conclude that the reasoning reflected in <em>Goins, Maffei, </em>as well as <em>Price Waterhouse, Schwenk, </em>and <em>Rosa </em>is more closely connected to our own state\u2019s historic policy of liberally construing the LAD. <em>Fraser v. Robin Dee Day Camp, </em>44 <em>N.J. </em>480, 486, 210 A.2d 208 (1965). There is also some New Jersey support for the position that precluding discrimination on the basis of sex also precludes gender discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>In <em>Zalewski v. Overlook Hosp., </em>300 <em>N.J.Super. </em>202, 692 A.2d 131 (Law Div.1996), Judge Menza decided that the LAD applied to sexual harassment of a heterosexual male by other heterosexual males when the harassment was based on gender stereotyping. In <em>Zalewski, </em>the plaintiffs coworkers harassed him because they thought he was a virgin. They never suggested his sexual orientation was anything other than heterosexual and there was no evidence that he was homosexual or bisexual. <em>Id. </em>at 203-04, 692 A.2d 131. Nevertheless, Judge Menza found a violation and noted that we should not \u201ccondone severe sexual harassment of a person because he is perceived or presumed to be less than someone\u2019s definition of masculine.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 211, 692 A.2d 131.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">A generation ago, when Justice Handler served in the Appellate Division, he found that \u201c[t]he evidence and authority which we have examined, however, show that a person\u2019s sex or sexuality embraces an individual\u2019s gender, that is, one\u2019s self-image, the deep psychological or emotional sense of sexual identity and character.\u201d <em>M.T. v. J.T., </em>140 <em>N.J.Super. </em>77, 86, 355 A.2d 204 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>71 <em>N.J. </em>345, 364 A.2d 1076 (1976). We agree with Justice Handler that \u201csex\u201d embraces an \u201cindividual\u2019s gender,\u201d and is broader than anatomical sex. \u201c[S]ex is comprised of more than a person\u2019s genitalia at birth.\u201d Flynn, <em>supra, </em>101 <em>Colum. L.Rev. </em>at 415. The word \u201csex\u201d as used in the LAD should be interpreted to include gender, protecting from discrimination on the basis of sex or gender.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-7\">It is incomprehensible to us that our Legislature would ban discrimination against heterosexual men and women; against homosexual men and women; against bisexual men and women; against men and women who are perceived, presumed or identified by others as not conforming to the stereotypical notions of how men and women behave, but would condone discrimination against men or women who seek to change their anatomical sex because they suffer from a gender identity disorder. We conclude that sex discrimination under the LAD includes gender discrimination so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>as to protect plaintiff from gender stereotyping and discrimination for transforming herself from a man to a woman.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">Plaintiff also contends that gender dysphoria is a handicap and a recognized disability under the LAD. It is unlawful to discriminate against an employee because of a handicap \u201cunless the nature and extent of the handicap reasonably precludes the performance of the particular employment.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>10:5-4.1. The LAD has defined \u201chandicapped\u201d as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-6\">suffering from physical disability, infirmity, malformation or disfigurement which is caused by bodily injury, birth defect or illness, ... or from any mental, psychological or developmental disability resulting from anatomical, psychological, physiological or neurological conditions which prevents the normal exercise of any bodily or mental functions or is demonstrable, medically or psychologically, by accepted clinical or laboratory diagnostic techniques____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-7\"><em>[N.J.S.A </em>10:5-5(q)]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b546-8\">In this case we are not dealing with any \u201cphysical disability, infirmity, malformation or disfigurement which is caused by bodily injury, birth defect or illness.\u201d We are dealing with the portion of the statute that provides that a person can be handicapped if they suffer from a \u201cmental, psychological or developmental disability resulting from anatomical, psychological, physiological or neurological conditions which prevents the normal exercise of any bodily or mental functions or is demonstrable, medically or psychologically, by accepted clinical or laboratory diagnostic techniques.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b546-9\">Plaintiff is, however, relying exclusively on the clinical or laboratory diagnostic portion of the definition. She does not argue that transsexualism prevented the normal exercise of any bodily or mental functions. And, according to plaintiff, her condition did not interfere with the adequate performance of her work at the Center. Termination of a \u201chandicapped\u201d employee, whose condition does not prevent the employee from doing her job, is actionable under the LAD. <em>Gimello v. Agency Rent-A-Car Sys., Inc., </em>250 <em>N.J.Super. </em>338, 365, 594 A.2d 264 (App.Div.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>Therefore, in this case plaintiff asks us to determine whether gender dysphoria is a handicap and protected by the LAD because it is a \u201cmental, psychological or developmental disability resulting from anatomical, psychological, physiological or neurological conditions which ... is demonstrable, medically or psychologically, by accepted clinical or laboratory diagnostic techniques.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">As remedial social legislation, the LAD is deserving of a liberal construction, especially with regard to handicaps. <em>Clowes v. Terminix Int\u2019l, Inc., </em>109 <em>N.J. </em>575, 590, 538 A.2d 794 (1988); <em>Andersen v. Exxon Co., U.S.A., </em>89 <em>N.J. </em>483, 495, 446 A.2d 486 (1982). The statutory definition of handicapped under <em>N.J.S.A </em>10:5-5(q) is very broad in its scope, <em>Clowes v. Terminix, supra, </em>109 <em>N.J. </em>at 593, 538 A.2d 794, and is not limited to \u201csevere\u201d disabilities. <em>Andersen v. Exxon, supra, </em>89 <em>N.J. </em>at 494-95, 446 A.2d 486. Rather, it prohibits discrimination against those suffering from any disability. <em>Id. </em>at 495, 446 A.2d 486.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-7\">The parties agree that gender dysphoria is listed in the <em>DSM-IV </em>as a disorder. Defendants argue correctly, however, that this listing is not dispositive for classification as a disability under the LAD. Merely because a condition is a disorder listed in the <em>DSM-IV </em>does not mean it is also a handicap under the LAD. <em>A.B.C. v. XYZ Corp., </em>282 <em>N.J.Super. </em>494, 508, 660 A.2d 1199 (App.Div.1995) (Petrella, J.A.D., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b547-8\">A disorder is not necessarily the equivalent of a disease, disability, illness, or defect, especially where these terms carry legal significance. <em>Id. </em>at 507-08, 660 A.2d 1199 (Petrella, J.A.D., concurring). Moreover, the LAD itself does not preclude discrimination based on conduct. <em>N.J.S.A </em>10:5-2.1. In addition, the <em>DSM-IV </em>also cautions that categorization of conditions contained in the manual \u201cmay not be wholly relevant to legal judgments, for example, that take into account such issues as individual responsibility, disability determination, and competency.\u201d <em>DSM-IV, supra, </em>Cautionary Statement at xxvii.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) expressly excludes \u201ctransvestism, transsexualism, pedophilia, exhibitionism, voyeurism, gender identity disorders not resulting from physical impairments, other sexual behavior disorders.\u201d 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 12211(b)(1). That statute also contains a requirement that the impairment be one which substantially limits a major life activity. 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 12102(2)(A). Our own statute does not contain such a restriction. Moreover, our own Legislature has not considered or addressed similar exclusions. <em>A.B.C. v. XYZ, supra, </em>282 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 508 n. 3, 660 A.2d 1199 (Petrella, J.A.D., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\">Other state courts, however, appear to be split on this issue when construing their own statutes. For example, a Pennsylvania court has concluded that transsexualism is not a disability under the Pennsylvania Human Relations Act because that statute requires that the disability substantially limit a major life activity and because petitioner did not contend that transsexualism affected any bodily function. <em>Holt v. Northwest Pa. Training P\u2019ship Consortium, Inc., </em>694 A.2d 1134, 1139 (Pa.Commw.Ct.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">A Washington state court, however, has construed gender dysphoria as a handicap under the Washington Law Against Discrimination, finding that it is a medically cognizable and diagnosable condition, that those who suffer from it endure great mental and emotional agony, and that it has a prescribed course of treatment. <em>Doe v. Boeing Co., </em>121 Wash.2d 8, 846 P.2d 531, 535-36 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">An Iowa court reached the contrary conclusion construing its statute which also contains a \u201cmajor life activity\u201d restriction. <em>Sommers v. Iowa Civil Rights Comm\u2019n, supra, </em>337 N.W.2d at 475. The court noted that a person who is anatomically of one sex but psychologically and emotionally of the other sex has a problem that does not necessarily constitute the kind of mental condition that the Legislature intended to be treated as a substantial handicap. <em>Id. </em>at 476. Transsexualism should not ordinarily affect a person\u2019s capacity to engage in major life activities. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>Our problem with the out-of-state cases concluding that gender dysphoria is not a disability is that our statute is very broad and does not require that a disability restrict any major life activities to any degree. In <em>Olson v. Gen. Elec. Astrospace, </em>966 <em>F.Supp. </em>312 (D.N.J.1997), for example, the federal court found that plaintiffs conditions of depression and multiple personality disorder were recognized disabilities under the LAD because they were demonstrable, medically or psychologically, by accepted clinical or laboratory diagnostic techniques, because these ailments were generally understood by the medical profession as diseases, and because the plaintiff had sought legitimate treatment for them. <em>Id. </em>at 315.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">Our courts have held that the LAD recognizes as disabilities such conditions as alcoholism, <em>Clowes v. Terminix, supra, </em>109 <em>N.J. </em>at 593-94, 538 A.2d 794; obesity, <em>Gimello v. Agency Rent-A-Car, supra, </em>250 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 361-62, 594 A.2d 264; and substance abuse, <em>In re Cahill, </em>245 <em>N.J.Super. </em>397, 400, 585 A.2d 977 (App. Div.1991). The LAD has thus been broadly and liberally construed to include what otherwise might be termed emotional or mental disorders, in order to eradicate the evil of discrimination in New Jersey. \u201cEmployment discrimination due to sex or any other invidious classification is peculiarly repugnant in a society which prides itself on judging each individual by his or her merits.\u201d <em>Peper v. Princeton Univ. Bd. of Trs., </em>77 <em>N.J. </em>55, 80, 389 A.2d 465 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b549-7\">Gender dysphoria is regarded medically as a \u201cmental disorder occurring in an estimated frequency of 1:50,000 individuals.\u201d Cole, Emory, Huang, Meyer, <em>Treatment of Gender Dysphoria, </em>90 <em>Tex. Med. </em>68 (1994). Moreover, treatment for the disorder can now \u201cbe regarded as accepted medical practice.\u201d <em>Ibid. See also Farmer v. Brennan, </em>511 <em>U.S. </em>825, 829, 114 <em>S.Ct. </em>1970, 1975, 128 L.Ed.2d 811, 820 (1994) (transsexualism is a rare psychiatric disorder in which a person feels persistently uncomfortable about his or her anatomical sex and seeks medical treatment including <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>hormonal therapy and surgery to bring about permanent sex change) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">The disorder is recognized within <em>DSM-IV, </em>thus confirming that the condition can be diagnosed by accepted clinical techniques. In fact, the <em>DSM-IV </em>lists four criteria necessary for diagnosing a gender identity disorder. Furthermore, gender dysphoria does not cause violations of the law as does exhibitionism, which was the <em>DSM-IV </em>disorder Judge Petrella struggled with in <em>A.B.C. v. XYZ, supra, </em>282 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 506-09, 660 A.2d 1199; <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:14-4.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">The <em>DSM-IV </em>also notes that each recognized disorder contained within the manual \u201cis associated with present distress (e.g., a painful symptom) or disability (i.e., impairment in one or more important areas of functioning) or with a significantly increased risk of suffering death, pain, disability, or an important loss of freedom.\u201d <em>DSM-IV, supra, </em>at xxi. With regard to gender dysphoria specifically, the manual notes that the \u201cdisturbance causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.\u201d <em>DSM-IV, supra, </em>\u00a7 302.85 at 537-38. Transsexualism can be accompanied by a profound sense of loathing for an individuals\u2019s primary and secondary sexual characteristics, which is overwhelming and unalterable. <em>Dr. L. Gooren, An Appraisal of endocrine theories of homosexuality and gender dysphoria. In: Handbook of Sexology vol. 6, </em>410-24 (Sitsen JMA, Amsterdam, Elsevier Science Publishers 1988). Thus, gender dysphoria is a recognized mental or psychological disability that can be demonstrated psychologically by accepted clinical diagnostic techniques and qualifies as a handicap under the LAD. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>10:5-5(q).</p>\n<p id=\"b550-7\">To establish the first element of a discriminatory discharge case under the LAD, however, an employee must submit proof that he or she was handicapped. <em>Maher v. N.J. Transit Rail Operations, Inc., </em>125 <em>N.J. </em>455, 480-81, 593 A.2d 750 (1991); <em>Clowes v. Terminix Int\u2019l, Inc., supra, </em>109 <em>N.J. </em>at 596, 538 A.2d 794. Here, the dismissal of plaintiffs complaint was based solely on the motion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>judge\u2019s conclusion that gender dysphoria was not a handicap under the LAD. While we have concluded that gender dysphoria can constitute a handicap, we have problems with the proofs submitted by plaintiff during the summary judgment proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">We note that plaintiffs proofs are not clear regarding the quality and quantity of impairment plaintiff may have suffered from this disorder. While the LAD does not require proof that some major life activity was impaired, plaintiff must suffer a disability. There is some evidence that before the surgery plaintiffs stress increased and her \u201cmoods worsened.\u201d There is also evidence that before her surgery plaintiff was argumentative and had difficulty controlling her temper. Since the surgery, plaintiff acknowledged experiencing greater \u201chumanity,\u201d with her patients noting \u201chow much more open and able to talk to me they are, particularly the adolescents.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b551-7\">In addition, we recognize that as part of her treatment protocol, plaintiff underwent sexual reassignment surgery, a process that most persons would not undertake unless necessary to eliminate great stress or extreme discomfort. Solely from the circumstances of plaintiffs course of treatment, we can infer sufficient impairment of plaintiffs emotional and mental well being to constitute a disability under the LAD. Plaintiffs proofs were adequate to at least raise a factual issue for summary judgment purposes establishing that her condition was a disability under the LAD. <em>Brill v. Guardian Life Ins. Co. of Am., </em>142 <em>N.J. </em>520, 540, 666 A.2d 146 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b551-8\">To constitute a handicap, however, the disability must also result \u201cfrom anatomical, psychological, physiological or neurological conditions which ... is demonstrable ... psychologically, by accepted clinical ... diagnostic techniques. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>10:5 \u2014 5(q). The record is completely silent on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-9\">There is an absence of evidence from Dr. Stayton confirming that he diagnosed gender dysphoria in plaintiff, explaining the condition as it manifested itself in plaintiff, and detailing the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>methods the doctor utilized to diagnose plaintiff. While \u201c[n]othing ... prevents a medical doctor from testifying as an expert in [her] own case,\u201d <em>Carey v. Lovett, </em>132 <em>N.J. </em>44, 64, 622 A.2d 1279 (1993), evidence of her specific disorder and its diagnosis appear to be beyond plaintiffs training and specialty.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-4\">While the <em>DSM-IV </em>does detail the elements necessary to diagnose a <em>gender </em>disorder, there has been some criticism of these elements. Dr. Herbert Bower contends, for example, that the classification \u201cneglects a number of diagnostically significant symptoms and characteristics of classical transsexualism.\u201d The doctor argues that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-5\">The initially mentioned four criteria omit the overwhelming desire to have the genitalia altered. The symptomatology does not include important features such as masturbation with fantasy of intercourse with a person of the same anatomical gender, occasional arousal during cross-dressing in the initial phase, lack of sexual interest during adolescence, stressful puberty and an essentially normal child rearing process.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-6\">[Herbert Bower, <em>The gender identity dism-der in the DSMTV classification </em>\u2014 a <em>critical evaluation, at http://umrw.pfc.org.uk/ </em>eongress/abstract/abs-005.html.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b552-7\">Thus, to establish that she is handicapped under the LAD, plaintiff must prove that she had gender dysphoria and that the disorder was diagnosed by \u201caccepted clinical or laboratory diagnostic techniques.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>10:5-5(q). The record is silent regarding whether the diagnostic technique utilized by Dr. Stayton was \u201caccepted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b552-8\">The motion judge rejected plaintiffs complaint solely because he believed that gender dysphoria could not be a handicap under the LAD. We disagree with this assessment and reverse on that basis. Because the case must be remanded for trial on plaintiffs gender discrimination claim, we leave plaintiff to her proofs on whether she had gender dysphoria and whether her condition was diagnosed in a fashion sufficient to qualify as a handicap under the LAD.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-9\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-10\">Because the matter must be remanded, we briefly consider the other claims raised by this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>A.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">Summary judgment was granted the Center for Family Guidance (\u201cCFG\u201d) defendants, and plaintiffs complaint was dismissed as to them. According to plaintiffs complaint, defendant CFG was the successor to the Center and was owned by defendant James Varrell, M.D. Defendant Les Pascal was the chief financial officer of CFG. There is nothing in the summary judgment record to support plaintiffs allegation that the CFG defendants refused to hire plaintiff for her gender or any other discriminatory reasons. None of the CFG defendants ever worked with plaintiff, employed plaintiff or were parties to her employment contract. In addition, there is nothing in this record establishing that these defendants uttered any false or defamatory statements about her. Indeed, plaintiff was never involved in any business relationship or transaction with the CFG defendants. Consequently, all of plaintiffs claims against these defendants were properly dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-7\">Plaintiff argues that the court erred in dismissing her claim for breach of contract. Plaintiff acknowledges that her contract permitted West Jersey to terminate her services on ninety-days notice for any reason or no reason. She nevertheless contends that the contract contained a good faith provision, and her written notice of termination also advised that she would be contacted by Cossa to discuss a new contract with Physicians\u2019 Associates, the entity which would be assuming control over the Center\u2019s program. Thus, plaintiff contends that she reasonably relied on defendants to negotiate with her in good faith leading to a new contract. This is not the kind of good faith breach that is actionable. <em>Noye v. Hoffmann-LaRoche, Inc., </em>238 <em>N.J.Super. </em>430, 433, 570 A.2d 12 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>122 <em>N.J. </em>146, 147, 584 A.2d 218 (1990). There is no breach of any kind in this case. Nothing in plaintiffs contract required defendants to re-hire her once they chose to terminate her. Also, this claim is nothing more than her LAD claim restated as a common-law contract claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>Plaintiff also argued that there were other provisions of her contract, such as educational leave, equipment requirements and billing procedures that were breached by defendants. As pointed out by defendants, however, plaintiff is unable to demonstrate any compensable loss to her relating to defendants\u2019 alleged \u201cbreach\u201d of these provisions. Most, if not all, of these alleged \u201cbreaches\u201d relate to plaintiffs displeasure regarding the manner in which the Center operated. Consequently, plaintiffs breach of contract claim was correctly dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-4\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">Plaintiff argues that the court erred in dismissing her claim for trade libel. Trade libel consists of communications made to a third person of false statements concerning the plaintiff, or plaintiffs property or business. <em>Henry V. Vaccaro Constr. Co. v. A.J. DePace, Inc., </em>137 <em>N.J.Super. </em>512, 514, 349 A.2d 570 (Law Div.1975). The communication must be made to a third person, and it must be false and play a material part in inducing others not to deal with plaintiff. <em>Prosser &amp; Keeton on Torts </em>\u00a7 128 at 967 (5th ed.1984). It can include a false statement that plaintiff has gone out of business. <em>Id. </em>at 963. It is also essential that the plaintiff establish damages. <em>Id. </em>at 965.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">In such an action brought against a former employer for publishing defamatory information about the employee to prospective new employers, a qualified privilege extends to the defendant who responds in good faith to specific inquiries about the employee\u2019s qualifications. <em>Kass v. Great Coastal Express, Inc., </em>152 <em>N.J. </em>353, 355-56, 704 A.2d 1293 (1998). This privilege will be abused if the defendant knows the statement is false or acts in reckless disregard of its truth or falsity, if the publication serves a purpose contrary to the interests of the qualified privilege, or if the statement is excessively published. <em>Id. </em>at 356, 704 A.2d 1293.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>Here, plaintiffs trade libel claim was dismissed on summary judgment, despite the fact that in opposition, plaintiff submitted two affidavits from parents of two patients who alleged that defendants had lied to them about the status of plaintiffs medical license and practice following her termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">If plaintiffs allegations are true, she has established a <em>prima facie </em>case of trade libel. Whether plaintiff can ultimately prevail on this claim will depend on the proofs plaintiff can marshal regarding defendants\u2019 conduct and on whether defendants can validly assert a qualified privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-7\">Defendants also argue, however, that plaintiff failed to prove that any patient chose to go elsewhere as a result of what defendants said about her. While plaintiffs damages for this tort appear, at this time, to be nebulous, we believe that plaintiff submitted sufficient opposition to withstand summary judgment. <em>Brill v. Guardian Life Ins. Co. of Am., supra, </em>142 <em>N.J. </em>at 535, 666 A.2d 146.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-8\">The affidavits together with plaintiffs deposition testimony lead to a reasonable inference that plaintiff may have suffered some damage from defendants\u2019 alleged conduct. Plaintiffs deposition indicated that of the approximate fifty patients who communicated with her after her termination by West Jersey, she retained about half as patients. Thus, plaintiff should be given an opportunity to establish her damages, if any, through further discovery or trial, and we reinstate plaintiffs trade libel claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-9\">D.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-10\">Plaintiff claims that the court erred in dismissing her claims for malicious interference with economic relations and unjust enrichment. These claims were asserted in plaintiffs second complaint, the one she filed right before the court ruled on defendants\u2019 motions for summary judgment regarding her first complaint. These claims are based on the same set of facts as plaintiffs trade libel claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>The West Jersey defendants assert that plaintiffs employment contract provided that all patients treated at the Center and all of their medical records were solely those of West Jersey. Defendants claim that the contract negates any finding that they were unjustly enriched or maliciously interfered with plaintiffs relationships with her patients because none of the patients belonged to plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">Even if the patients did not \u201cbelong\u201d to plaintiff, the contract between West Jersey and plaintiff cannot prevent the patients from seeing any medical professional they choose. If patients who wished to continue their relationships with plaintiff were dissuaded solely because of defendants\u2019 malicious or unjust behavior, plaintiff may have valid causes of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">These claims were rejected by the motion judge because he believed them to be \u201ca repetition, a repackaging of the first complaint\u201d including the trade libel claim, which had been previously dismissed. We are reinstating plaintiffs trade libel claim, and note that alternative or even inconsistent pleading of viable claims is permissible. <em>R. </em>4:5-6.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-7\">We conclude that plaintiff should have the opportunity to seek to amend her first complaint to add counts for unjust enrichment and interference with economic advantage. Assuming that after remand plaintiff moves to amend the complaint, the trial court shall decide whether or not to permit plaintiff to add these claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-8\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-9\">In conclusion, the LAD \u201cwas first enacted in 1945. Its purpose is \u2018nothing less than the eradication\u2019 of the cancer of discrimination.\u201d <em>Lehmann v. Toys \u2018R\u2019 Us, Inc., </em>132 <em>N.J. </em>587, 600, 626 A.2d 445 (1993) (citing <em>Fuchilla v. Layman, </em>109 <em>N.J. </em>319, 334, 537 A.2d 652 (quoting <em>Jackson v. Concord Co., </em>54 <em>N.J. </em>113, 124, 253 A.2d 793 (1969)), <em>cert. denied sub nom., Univ. of Med. &amp; Dentistry of N.J. v. Fuchilla, </em>488 <em>U.S. </em>826, 109 <em>S.Ct. </em>75, 102 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>51, (1988)). The Legislature\u2019s goal is that only \u201clegitimate distinctions between citizens\u201d be made. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>10:5-3. Distinctions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>must be made on the basis of merit, rather than skin color, age, sex or gender, or any other measure that obscures a person\u2019s individual humanity and worth. This case represents another step toward achieving what has thus far been an elusive goal.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">With respect to the West Jersey defendants, we reverse the dismissal of plaintiffs claims for sex discrimination and trade libel and affirm the dismissal of plaintiffs breach of contract claim. We reinstate the sex discrimination and trade libel claims and remand the case for further proceedings. With regard to plaintiffs claim for handicap discrimination, we reverse the dismissal of plaintiffs claim and conclude that gender dysphoria can be a handicap under the LAD. We remand the handicap discrimination claim so plaintiff can attempt, if she wishes, to establish her cause of action in accordance with the guidance we have provided. On remand, plaintiff may seek to amend her complaint to add claims for malicious interference and unjust enrichment, and the trial court shall decide whether to grant or deny this motion. We take no position on the merits of such a motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-7\">We affirm the dismissal of all claims brought against the CFG defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-8\">Affirmed in part, reversed in part and remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
