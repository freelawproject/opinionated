Plaintiff Patricia McQueen (the landlord), who occupies the second-floor unit on a part-time basis, initiated two successive actions for possession of the first floor apartment leased to defendants Steven Cook and John Brown (the tenants). These actions resulted in judgments in favor of the tenants in both cases. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>In the first action, plaintiff sought to remove the tenants for non-payment of rent. The tenants raised the defense that the lease was illegal and, therefore, unenforceable because plaintiff had not obtained a municipal occupancy permit as required by Chapter 194 of the Atlantic City Municipal Code (the ordinance). The judge agreed and dismissed the complaint for possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">In the second action brought immediately after the dismissal of the complaint for non-payment of rent, plaintiff sought to remove the tenants under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:18-53, claiming the unit was exempt from the Anti-Eviction Act\u2019s good cause grounds for eviction, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:18-61.1a-q, because the premises were owner-occupied with not more than two rental units. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:18-61.1 (1) The judge dismissed the complaint, concluding that plaintiffs limited occupancy of the second-floor apartment, consisting of eight or nine days per month, did not qualify the unit as \u201cowner-occupied\u201d under the statutory exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">In the first action, the parties stipulated to the facts. In the second action, the judge heard testimony and made findings of fact with respect to the extent of plaintiffs personal occupancy. These are the relevant facts. Plaintiff is the owner of a three-floor apartment building located at 517 North Ohio Avenue in Atlantic City. Pursuant to a written lease dated August 1, 1994,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> plaintiff leased the first-floor apartment to the tenants at a monthly rent of $500. At the time the complaint was filed on May 7, 1999, the tenants had been withholding their rent for six months because of \u201calleged habitability defects,\u201d and owed rent of approximately $3,000. The record is silent as to the nature of these \u201calleged habitability defects.\u201d Prior to leasing the apartment to the tenants, plaintiff had not obtained an occupancy permit from \u201cthe Atlantic City code enforcement office\u201d nor had she obtained such permit at the time the litigation was commenced.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>Plaintiffs primary residence is in Philadelphia but, for the past twenty years, she and her mother have used the Atlantic City apartment on weekends and holidays, as well as for vacations. Plaintiffs apartment is fully furnished and she receives certain \u201cbills\u201d at that address. The third-floor apartment is occupied by plaintiffs cousin, Winfred Young, who does not pay rent.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">With respect to the non-payment of rent action, the trial judge concluded that no rent was legally due and owing because plaintiff failed to obtain an occupancy permit before renting the apartment to the tenants in 1994 or at any subsequent time. He determined that either the failure to obtain the occupancy permit, or the inability to provide the tenant with habitable premises, \u201cstanding alone,\u201d was a sufficient basis for denying plaintiffs claim for possession, concluding that the lease was unenforceable.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-7\">He stated, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-8\">If a municipality passes an ordinance which requires a certificate of occupancy as a precondition for renting premises, as the City of Atlantic City has, it must logically follow that a lease which is violative of such an ordinance is unenforceable. Thus a landlord whose lease violates a certificate of occupancy ordinance is unable to prove the amount of rent due, and there is no reason why a tenant cannot assert such illegality as a defense to the claim of rent due, just like any other defense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b155-9\">With respect to the action based on the owner-occupied exception to the good cause requirement of the Anti-Eviction Act (the Act), <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:18-61.1, the judge determined that because \u201cthe property is not plaintiffs principal residence,\u201d her occupancy being limited to \u201cweekends totaling at most eight or nine days per month,\u201d she was not an \u201cowner-occupier\u201d and, therefore, she could not evict the tenants without good cause under the Act. We disagree and reverse the judgments dismissing the complaints in both summary dispossess actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-11\">We address first the question whether plaintiffs failure to obtain an occupancy permit, \u201cstanding alone,\u201d renders the lease <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>illegal and unenforceable, thereby precluding plaintiff from summarily recovering the premises from the tenants for non-payment of rent.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">Subsection (a) of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:18-61.1 provides that a tenant may be removed if that person \u201cfails to pay rent due and owing under the lease whether the same be oral or written.\u201d However, \u201cthe amount claimed to be due must be \u2018legally owing\u2019 at the time the complaint was filed.\u201d <em>Chau v. Cardillo, </em>250 <em>N.J.Super. </em>378, 384, 594 A.2d 1334 (App.Div.1990) (citing <em>Housing Auth. of Passaic v. Torres, </em>143 <em>N.J.Super. </em>231, 236, 362 A.2d 1254 (App.Div.1976)). Whether the rent is \u201clegally owing\u201d depends on whether the lease is enforceable. We apply general principles of contract law to resolve the question. <em>See A.P. Development Corp. v. Band, </em>113 <em>N.J. </em>485, 504, 550 A.2d 1220 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">In <em>Khoudary v. Salem Cty., </em>260 <em>N.J.Super. </em>79, 81, 615 A.2d 281 (App.Div.1992), a landlord sued a county welfare agency for unpaid rent with respect to an apartment rented to a client of the agency. The landlord rented the premises without first obtaining an occupancy permit, in violation of a local housing ordinance. <em>Id. </em>at 83, 615 A.2d 281. The parties executed a lease, but the local housing authorities declared the premises uninhabitable before the tenants took occupancy. <em>Ibid. </em>We held the suit for rent was frivolous and subject to an award of attorneys\u2019 fees under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:15-59.1. <em>Id. </em>at 88, 615 A.2d 281. In that context, we stated that \u201c[a] landlord\u2019s right to receive payment of rent for a residential unit is contractual, and is based upon consideration in the form of the landlord\u2019s providing the tenant with a habitable living unit which complies with the requirements of the state and municipal law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 85, 615 A.2d 281 (citing <em>Berzito v. Gambino, </em>63 <em>N.J. </em>460, 469, 308 A.2d 17 (1973)). We explained that because plaintiff was unable to provide the prospective tenant with a habitable residential rental unit, \u201c[plaintiff] had no contractual basis on which to demand rent because he could not deliver lawful possession and quiet enjoyment of the premises.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>We stated that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>\u201c[a] landlord cannot require of a tenant what the law forbids.\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">The ordinance in <em>Khoudary </em>was similar to the ordinance in the present case. Chapter 194-1A reads, in relevant part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-7\">No owner ... shall rent ... lease, let with right of occupancy, or occupy, whether or not for a consideration, a ... dwelling unit or apartment unless an occupancy permit is issued certifying that said ... dwelling unit or apartment is in compliance with all other ordinances of the City of Atlantic City. [Amended 6-24-1998 by Ord. No. 31-1998].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b157-8\">Chapter 194-2B provides that the issuing agent shall deny a permit if he or she determines that a dwelling or apartment is \u201cunfit for human habitation\u201d or if the conditions of the apartment are \u201cdangerous or injurious to the health, welfare or safety of the occupant.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b157-9\">Chapter 194-7A of the ordinance authorizes the issuance of short duration \u201cconditional occupancy permit[s]\u201d upon a finding that only minor violations exist. Chapter 194-9A contains the criminal penalties that may be assessed against owners who violate the occupancy permit ordinance.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The ordinance is silent, however, as to the effect of a violation on the landlord\u2019s right to collect rent while such violation persists.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-10\">Relying on <em>Khoudary, </em>the trial judge dismissed the complaint for possession because the landlord had not complied with the ordinance requiring an occupancy permit. We believe that reliance was misplaced. Unlike in <em>Khoudary, </em>the tenants here had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>been in possession of the leased premises for approximately five years when the judge declared the lease void and unenforceable. We know of no precedent that would allow a tenant to raise an illegality defense to his or her obligation to pay rent in circumstances where no evidence is presented to demonstrate that the premises were uninhabitable or, for that matter, that the premises were even defective. Neither <em>Khoudary </em>nor any of the out-of-state eases we uncovered are to the contrary. <em>See, e.g., Noble v. Alis, </em>474 N.E.2d 109, 112 (Ind.Ct.App.1985) (involving a landlord\u2019s unsuccessful suit for rent where the court held that the lease was unenforceable because the landlord had failed to obtain an occupancy permit, the premises were uninhabitable, and the prospective tenants had never occupied the premises).</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">We conclude that a lease is not automatically void simply because the landlord failed to obtain an occupancy permit; other factors bear equitably on the problem. <em>See Norlund v. Faust, </em>675 <em>N.E.2d </em>1142 (Ind.Ct.App.1997) (citing <em>Noble, supra, </em>474 N.E.2d 109). Those factors include consideration of the public policy underlying the law that has been contravened, whether voiding the lease will actually further that policy, the burden or detriment to the respective parties if the lease is voided, and the benefit which the party seeking to avoid the bargain has enjoyed. <em>See id. </em>at 1151.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">Applying these factors here, we conclude the court erred by declaring the lease void and unenforceable. We look first to the policy behind the ordinance requiring an occupancy permit. In promulgating the ordinance, it is fairly evident that the City endeavored to assure that the rental housing stock would be safe and habitable before 'a tenant moved into a dwelling unit by establishing an inspection and repair process for curing defects in the premises.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> That policy is not advanced by a rule that would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>declare a lease void because the landlord did not obtain an occupancy permit at its inception, or even thereafter, where the tenants have been residing in the premises for almost five years, paying rent, and receiving the benefits of the occupancy, without demonstrating that the premises are uninhabitable. In other words, the policy of protecting tenants from dangerous living conditions is not promoted by declaring a lease invalid in the absence of demonstrated serious housing violations, either at the inception of the lease, or thereafter. Accordingly, the lease should not have been declared unenforceable against the landlord with the effect that the tenants were permitted to occupy the apartment rent-free for those months where the landlord was without an occupancy permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">We believe the better course was for the court to have adjourned the matter to allow plaintiff to apply for an occupancy permit and thereafter to have conducted a Marini<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> **70 hearing at which the tenants could have presented evidence with respect to the apartment\u2019s alleged habitability defects. Substituting a <em>Marini </em>defense in place of an illegality defense to the landlord\u2019s eviction action for non-payment of rent does not diminish the importance of the public policy underlying the ordinance for, either way the policy is vindicated. <em>See Noble, supra, </em>474 N.E.2d at 112 (\u201cthe tenant\u2019s remedy rests on their ability to prove a breach of an implied warranty of habitability\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b159-7\">We also believe that declaring the lease unenforceable after such a long period of time results in an unjustifiable burden on the landlord, and an undeserved benefit to the tenants who were permitted to live in the premises rent-free for the period the landlord did not have a permit. Where the tenants have not demonstrated their right to a rent abatement, let alone a rent-free <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>occupancy, declaring the lease void solely because the landlord did not have an occupancy permit in these circumstances works an impermissible forfeiture on the landlord and gives the tenants an unjustifiable windfall. It should hardly need saying, but \u201cequity abhors a forfeiture.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">Accordingly, we reverse the dismissal of plaintiffs summary dispossess complaint for non-payment of rent and remand the matter for further proceedings not inconsistent with this decision.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-7\">We address next the dismissal of plaintiffs second summary dispossess action. Relying on the \u201cowner-occupied\u201d exception in the Anti-Eviction Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:18-61.1(1), plaintiffs second complaint sought to remove the tenants under the holdover provisions of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:18-53. As previously noted, in dismissing the complaint, the judge concluded that because the premises were not plaintiffs \u201cprincipal residence,\u201d it did not qualify as an \u201cowner-occupied\u201d premises under the exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-8\">Plaintiff argues that her use of the premises eight or nine days per month is sufficient to qualify her for owner-occupied status because she maintains the apartment solely for her personal use. Defendants counter that allowing plaintiff to utilize the owner-occupied exception when the premises are not her primary residence would contravene the Act\u2019s purpose of protecting residential tenants from arbitrary eviction. The issue is one of first impression.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-9\">In <em>Dempsey v. Mastropasqua, </em>242 <em>N.J.Super. </em>234, 576 A.2d 335 (App.Div.1990), the issue was raised but not decided. In that ease, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>we determined that a 3.5% ownership interest in a building with not more than two rental units satisfies the ownership requirement. We concluded that \u201c[t]he word \u2018owner\u2019 conveys a meaning of nothing more than the emoluments of title,\u201d noting that \u201cthe Legislature did not qualify the word \u2018owner\u2019 when it wrote the statute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 238, 576 A.2d 335. Although the issue of the landlord\u2019s limited use of the premises was raised in that case, we did not rule on whether the landlord\u2019s occupancy prevented him from achieving owner-occupant status. We did state, however, that we did not intend our holding on the title issue in any way to imply that we agreed with the trial judge that the landlord\u2019s limited use of his unit was insufficient occupancy to qualify as \u201cowner-occupied.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 237 n. 1, 576 A.2d 335. In fact we do not.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">In construing a statute we strive to effectuate the Legislature\u2019s intent as expressed by the clear language of the statute. <em>Turner v. First Union Nat\u2019l Bank, </em>162 <em>N.J. </em>75, 84, 740 A.2d 1081 (1999). In determining the legislative intent, we not only look to the language of the statute, but to the policy underlying the statute, concepts of reasonableness, and legislative history, if any. <em>Coletti v. Union Cty. Bd. of Chosen Freeholders, </em>217 <em>N.J.Super. </em>31, 35, 524 A.2d 1270 (App.Div.1987). However, we must not presume that the Legislature intended something other than what it expressed in the language of the statute. <em>In re Jamesburg High School Closing, </em>83 <em>N.J. </em>540, 548, 416 A.2d 896 (1980). Indeed, as we stated in <em>Dempsey:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-7\">[t]he meaning of a statute first must be sought in the language in which it is framed, and, if it is plain, our sole function is to enforce it according to its terms. When a statute is clear and unambiguous on its face, it is not open to construction or interpretation. We may not disregard plain statutory language to replace it with an unenaeted legislative intent, because such action would constitute the undemocratic process of judicial lawmaking.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-8\"><em>[Dempsey, supra, </em>242 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 238, 576 A.2d 335 (citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b162-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>The Anti-Eviction Act exempts an owner-occupier of premises with not more than two rental units from demonstrating good cause before a residential tenant can be evicted. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:18-61.1(1). In <em>Durruthy v. Brunert, </em>228 <em>N.J.Super. </em>199, 202, 549 A.2d 456 (App.Div.1988), <em>certif. denied, </em>114 <em>N.J. </em>482, 555 A.2d 607 (1989), we explained that the Legislature enacted the owner-occupied exception to give small residential landlords \u201csome control over the persons with whom [s]he lives.\u201d This exception resulted from the Legislature\u2019s recognition of \u201cthe unfairness of forcing residential landlords to live with tenants whom they found to be unfavorable.\u201d <em>Couey v. Sterling, </em>224 <em>N.J.Super. </em>581, 584, 540 A.2d 1359 (Law Div.1988) (quoting <em>Fresco v. Policastro, </em>186 <em>N.J.Super. </em>204, 206, 451 A.2d 1341 (Cty.D.Ct.1982)).</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">The word \u201coccupied,\u201d like the word \u201cowner\u201d contains no qualifying language. However, the Assembly Committee Statement, following the Act states that \u201c[t]o qualify for [the owner-occupied] exemption ... the actual \u2018owner\u2019 ... [of] the premises must reside there.\u201d Senate County and Municipal Government Committee, Statement to Assembly Bill No. 3251 (1991) (reprinted in N.J. <em>Stat. Ann. </em>\u00a7 2A:18-61.1 (West 2000)) (the Assembly Statement). The Assembly Statement, however, does not define the meaning of the word \u201creside.\u201d However, \u201cresidence\u201d has been defined as \u201c[t]he act or fact of living in a given place for some time\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>1310 (6th ed.1990). And \u201c[o]ur courts recognize that a person may have more than one residence but may not have more than one domicile.\u201d <em>Arents v. General Acc. Ins. Co., </em>280 <em>N.J.Super. </em>423, 428, 655 A.2d 936 (App.Div.1995) (citing <em>Mercadante v. City of Paterson, </em>111 <em>N.J.Super. </em>35, 39, 266 A.2d 611 (Ch.Div.1970), <em>aff'd o.b., </em>58 <em>N.J. </em>112, 275 A.2d 440 (1971)).</p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">N.J.S.A 2A:18-61.1 contains two other statutory exceptions to the good cause requirement which exempt dwelling units held in trust for the benefit of a developmentally disabled member of the settlor\u2019s immediate family who <em>permanently occupies </em>the unit, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:18-61.1(2), and dwelling units <em>permanently occupied </em>by a developmentally disabled member of the member\u2019s immediate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>family, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:18-61.1(3). In 1991, the Legislature amended the Anti-Eviction Act to exempt these types of dwelling units used by disabled persons for essentially the same reason the \u201cowner-occupied\u201d exception was enacted, namely, to facilitate the eviction of \u201can unfavorable co-tenant.\u201d <em>See </em>Assembly Statement, <em>supra. </em>As is evident from reviewing the disabled occupant exceptions, the Legislature expressly required that those units be \u201cpermanently occupied\u201d by the disabled person. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>2A:18-61.1(2) and (3). The Legislature defined \u201cpermanently occupied\u201d to mean that the occupant \u201cmaintains no other domicile at which the occupant votes, pays rent or property taxes or at which rent or property taxes are paid on the occupant\u2019s behalf.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:18-61.1q. No such expressed requirement is provided in the \u201cowner-occupied\u201d exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">Based on this legislative history and the plain language of the statute, we construe the \u201cowner-occupied premise\u201d exception as not requiring an \u201cowner-occupier\u201d to permanently occupy or use the unit as the owner\u2019s principal residence to qualify for the exception under <em>N.J.S.A </em>2A:18-61.1(1). To the extent the use of the word \u201creside\u201d in the Assembly Statement reflects the Legislature\u2019s intent that an owner be required to live in such a unit, we conclude only that the owner must live in the unit \u201cfor some time.\u201d We do not establish what that time period should be. The issue is fact-sensitive. In this case, plaintiff has resided in her apartment for twenty years, occupying it on a frequent basis as a weekend or holiday retreat. We are satisfied that plaintiffs occupancy for eight or nine days a month is more than sufficient to qualify her as an owner-occupier.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">We are confident that our conclusion does not contravene the purpose of the Act. While we recognize that \u201cthe Anti-Eviction Act is remedial legislation deserving of liberal construction,\u201d 44<em>7 Associates v. Miranda, </em>115 <em>N.J. </em>522, 529, 559 A.2d 1362 (1989), and that its \u201coverall purpose\u201d is to \u201cprotect[ ] blameless tenants from eviction,\u201d <em>Chase Manhattan Bank v. Josephson, </em>135 <em>N.J. </em>209, 226, 638 A.2d 1301 (1994), nevertheless, the landlord\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>interest is also entitled to due consideration. <em>See Durruthy, supra, </em>228 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 202, 549 A.2d 456.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">Accordingly, we conclude that when an owner of a building of not more than two rental units maintains and personally occupies his or her own unit on a part-time basis in good faith, the unit qualifies as an \u201cowner-occupied premises\u201d under the exception to the good cause requirement in the Anti-Eviction Act. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:18-61.1(1). There is no exact numerical formula for making that determination. Suffice it to say, however, if it can be demonstrated that an owner of such a small building does not reside on the premises at all, but maintains his or her unit only to preserve his or her eviction rights under the exemption, in that circumstance the unit would not qualify for the \u201cowner-occupied\u201d exemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">Reversed and remanded for proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b154-7\"> The lease is not in the record.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b154-8\"> According to the briefs on appeal, plaintiff has since obtained an occupancy permit, and the tenants resumed paying rent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b155-12\"> Winfred Young may be plaintiffs partner and co-owner of the building.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b157-11\"> Those conditions include, without limitation, \"defects increasing the hazard of fire, accident or other calamities, lack of adequate ventilation, light or sanitary facilities; dilapidation, disrepair or structural defects; and uncleanliness.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b157-12\"> It provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b157-13\">Any person or entity violating any terms of this chapter shall be subject to a fine of not less than $500 nor more than $1,000 or imprisonment for not more than 90 days, or both, for each violation except that, where a violation of this chapter occurs involving actual occupancy in a dwelling unit which is declared unfit for human habitation, the person or entity responsible shall be subject to a minimum fine of $1,0000 and/or 90 days in jail for each violation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b158-7\"> In 1980, the Legislature enacted enabling legislation under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:48-2.12m which authorized municipalities to adopt ordinances requiring owners to obtain occupancy permits before renting out or leasing dwelling units. Before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>this enactment, there was some disagreement as to whether municipalities had this power. <em>See Dome Realty, Inc. v. City of Paterson, </em>83 <em>N.J. </em>212, 228, 416 A.2d 334 (1980).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b159-11\"> <em>Marini v. Ireland, </em>56 <em>N.J. </em>130, 265 A.2d 526 (1970).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b160-10\"> Because this decision also concludes that plaintiff is entitled to possession of the apartment on her second complaint as an owner-occupier of a building with not more than two rental units, plaintiff may not want to have a <em>Marini </em>hearing but may prefer instead to pursue an action for the rent where the tenants\u2019 <em>Marini </em>defense can be adjudicated. Accordingly, upon plaintiff's written request, the matter may be transferred from the Landlord-Tenant Division to be heard as a suit for rent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b161-9\"> The record in <em>Dempsey </em>does not indicate the frequency or duration of the landlord's use of the premises.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
