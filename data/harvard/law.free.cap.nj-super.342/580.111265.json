(temporarily assigned).</author>\n<p id=\"b614-9\">Plaintiff Delfina Kaczorowska appeals the dismissal of her complaint against her employer, defendant National Envelope Corporation-East (NEC-East), and its parent, defendant National Envelope Corporation (NEC). Because matters beyond the pleadings were considered below, we analyze the viability of plaintiffs claims of liability against defendants under the summary judgment standard of <em>Rule </em>4:46-2. <em>See R. </em>4:6-2. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-10\">On January 30, 1998, plaintiff suffered a catastrophic amputation workplace injury. While walking towards another machine on which she was assigned to work, plaintiff tripped and fell over boxes in the aisle and got her arm entrapped in an unguarded timing/drive belt on a Latex 1 envelope-gluing machine. The original machine was designed and manufactured by New Jersey Machine Company who sold it to Envelope Converters, Inc. on February 1, 1971. Envelope Converters, Inc. was subsequently purchased by New York Envelope Corporation, which in 1993 became known as National Envelope Corporation (NEC), the parent company of plaintiffs employer. Back in 1981, NEC acquired another of its competitors, Champion Envelope Corporation, which in 1994 changed its name to National Envelope Corpo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>ration-East (NEC-East), plaintiffs employer and a wholly owned subsidiary of NEC.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">Shortly after the Latex 1 adhesive machine was sold, New Jersey Machine shipped to Envelope Converters, Inc. three perimeter guards to cover the unit\u2019s heating lamps. Two of the guards were installed on the rear of the machine; the third, on the side of the machine where the accident occurred. None of the three guards were on the machine at the time of the accident. Two of the guards were observed lying alongside of the machine after the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-7\">The initial design of the Latex 1 machine had been adapted to facilitate an attachment used to produce \u201cpeel and seal\u201d envelopes, a function the machine was not originally designed to perform. The \u201cpeel and seal\u201d attachment was designed by an employee of Champion Envelope Corporation, A1 Bruno, sometime after the company\u2019s acquisition by NEC in 1981 and before its name change to NEC-East. To operate the \u201cpeel and seal\u201d attachment, modifications were made to the original machine by Bruno including installation of a gear box, drive shaft, timing belt and several pulleys. Ac the time of the accident, the \u201cpeel and seal\u201d attachment was not being used; however, one of the timing belts was left hanging from a rotating drive shaft. Plaintiffs right arm became entangled in the unguarded, hanging timing belt.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-8\">Plaintiff originally sued New Jersey Machine and named NEC East as a defendant for the sole purpose of discovery. She then moved to amend her complaint to include NEC-East as a proper defendant, to include its parent corporation, NEC, as a defendant, and to assert the \u201cintentional wrong\u201d exception to the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act (Act) as a theory of liability. After a hearing on plaintiffs motion on November 5, 1999, Judge Sachar entered an order on March 3, 2000 granting plaintiff leave to amend her complaint adding NEC-East and NEC as defendants but specifically restricting her from including therein a count asserting the \u201cintentional wrong\u201d exception to the Act\u2019s exclusivity bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>On March 14, 2000, plaintiff filed an amended complaint asserting claims against her employer NEC-East based upon the so-called \u201cdual capacity\u201d doctrine<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and against her employer\u2019s parent, NEC, based on successor liability.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On June 9, 2000, Judge Sachar granted New Jersey Machine\u2019s motion for summary judgment as well as NEC-East and NEC\u2019s motion to dismiss all four counts of plaintiffs complaint against them. Plaintiff appeals from this decision as well as Judge Sachar\u2019s earlier ruling precluding a claim against NEC-East alleging \u201cintentional wrongdoing.\u201d We will discuss the latter first.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>1</p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">Plaintiff argues that her employer\u2019s removal of safety guards from the Latex 1 adhesive machine was an \u201cintentional wrong\u201d excepted from the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act\u2019s (Act) exclusivity bar. The Act precludes an employee injured during the course of employment from asserting a cause of action against her employer beyond the remedy provided therein, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:15-8, unless the employer\u2019s action was an \u201cintentional wrong.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:15-9. However, to further its underlying principle to process as many work-related disability claims as possible exclusively within the Act, the \u201cintentional wrong\u201d exception must be construed very narrowly. <em>Millison v. E.I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co., </em>101 <em>N.J. </em>161, 177, 501 A.2d 505 (1985); <em>Laidlow v. Hariton Machinery Co., Inc., </em>335 <em>N.J.Super. </em>330, 338, 762 A.2d 311 (App.Div.2000), <em>certif. denied, N.J. </em>(2001); <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Bustamante v.

Mitts &amp; Merrill, </em>303 <em>N.J.Super. </em>61, 72, 696 A.2d 55 (App.Div.1997). <em>See also Millison, supra, </em>101 <em>N.J. </em>at 171-73, 501 A.2d 505. Bather, the level of intent sufficient to overcome the exclusivity of the Act is a \u201cdeliberate intention to injure.\u201d <em>Mabee v. Borden, Inc., </em>316 <em>N.J.Super. </em>218, 227, 720 A.2d 342 (App.Div.1998) (internal citations and quotations omitted). An employer acts with such an intent when he \u201cdesires to cause consequences of his act or is substantially certain that such consequences will result from his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>actions.\u201d <em>Millison, supra, </em>101 <em>N.J. </em>at 178, 501 A.2d 505 (quoting from <em>Restatement 2d of Torts </em>\u00a7 8A).</p>\n<p id=\"b618-4\"> Thus, <em>\u201c[t]he </em>employee <em>may prove \u2018intent </em>to injure\u2019 not only by evidence of the employer\u2019s actual intent to injure, but also by circumstances where the employer knows an injury is a substantial or virtual certainty.\u201d <em>Mabee v. Borden, Inc., supra, </em>316 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 227, 720 A.2d 342 (quoting <em>New Jersey Manufacturers Insurance Co. v. Joseph Oat Corp., </em>287 <em>N.J.Super. </em>190, 197, 670 A.2d 1071 (App.Div.1995)). As the court in <em>Millison, supra, </em>emphasized, \u201cthe dividing line between negligent or reckless conduct on the one hand and intentional wrong on the other must be drawn with caution [as] ... [w]e must demand a virtual certainty.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 178, 501 A.2d 505.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">An employer\u2019s removal of a safety device does not present a per se prima facie case of an \u201cintentional wrong.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 171, 501 A.2d 505 (internal citation omitted); <em>Mabee, supra, </em>316 <em>N.J. Super, </em>at 230-231, 720 A.2d 342. Instead, the determination is fact sensitive and must be interpreted on a case by case basis. <em>Id. </em>at 231, 720 A.2d 342.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">In <em>Laidlow v. Hariton Machinery Co., Inc., supra, </em>this court affirmed summary judgment dismissing an employee\u2019s cause of action against his employer on facts considerably more egregious than here. In that case, an employee suffered a severe and debilitating injury when his fingers and hand were caught in a rolling mill machine. <em>Id. </em>at 334, 762 A.2d 311. Although a safety guard had been installed on the machine, the device was \u201cnever\u201d in its functioning position. <em>Id. </em>at 335, 762 A.2d 311. In fact, the device was \u201ctied up\u201d with wire so that it could not be readily engaged. <em>Ibid. </em>It was established that the device was not used because it hampered the operation of the mill. <em>Id. </em>at 336, 762 A.2d 311. The only time that the device was placed in the engaged position was when OSHA inspectors visited the plant, at which time supervisors ordered the device to be untied. <em>Id. </em>at 335-36, 762 A.2d 311.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>The plaintiff-employee had approached his supervisor several times regarding the use of the device. <em>Id. </em>at 336, 762 A.2d 311. One week prior to the injury, the plaintiff requested that the device be engaged because he believed it was dangerous to operate the machine without the device. <em>Ibid. </em>However, plaintiff continued to operate the machine without the device until he was injured. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">This court upheld the grant of summary judgment, finding that a narrow reading of the \u201cintentional wrong\u201d exception excludes a prima facie showing of intent to harm, even where the employer intentionally removed a safety device. <em>Id. </em>at 340, 762 A.2d 311. We explained that both <em>Millison </em>and <em>Mabee </em>require that the employer\u2019s conduct be analyzed in the proper context and, in that regard, noted that the safety device went unused as \u201ca matter of course\u201d in the factory and that there were no accidents in previous years. <em>Id. </em>at 341, 720 A.2d 342. While acknowledging that removal of a safety device suggested a substantial risk of injury, we held that more is required \u2014 a substantial or virtual certainty of injury \u2014 and thus concluded the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-7\">What is at issue here is a workplace condition and circumstance that reasonable persons could not conclude constitute a substantial or virtual certainty of injury. This view does not provide an opportunity for \u201cone free injury,\u201d for it is not an injury that proves certainty, but the workplace conditions described, and whether they implicate substantial or virtual certainty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-8\"><em>[Id. </em>at 342.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b619-9\">Here, the record admits no proof of intentional wrongdoing. In the first place, the accident occurred not through use of the allegedly defective machinery but rather because plaintiff slipped and fell at the workplace, entirely unrelated to her operation of the machine. In fact, at the time of the accident, the \u201cpeel and seal\u201d attachment was not even being used although one of the timing belts was left hanging from a rotating drive shaft. To be sure, the safety guards supplied by the original manufacturer were not present on the machine. Nevertheless, the record in this case does not suggest there was a virtual certainty that an employee would trip and attempt to break her fall by entangling <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>her arm in the hanging timing belt. To the contrary, there were no prior accidents placing the employer on notice of any dangerous condition. Moreover, plaintiff received safety training and instructions. She was under no production quota and there were no bonuses for the number of envelopes produced. The modification made to the original machine was simply a device enabling it to produce \u201cpeel and seal\u201d envelopes and not to increase productivity.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-4\">Under these facts and circumstances, no rational fact finder could conclude plaintiffs employer is liable for an \u201cintentional wrong.\u201d Judge Sachar properly precluded plaintiffs purported cause of action against defendant NEC-East based on this exception to the exclusivity bar of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">ii</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">Plaintiff also asserted a direct liability claim against NEC East based not on its status as her employer but on its second capacity of manufacturer by virtue of its substantial alteration and modification of the Latex 1 machine. She also sued NEC-East\u2019s parent, NEC, vicariously, claiming it succeeds to the liability of the company it acquired, Champion Envelope, the so-called \u201cmanufacturer\u201d of the allegedly defective \u201cpeel and seal\u201d attachment. Judge Sachar granted defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment dismissing these claims based on theories of \u201cdual capacity\u201d and \u201csuccessor liability.\u201d On appeal, plaintiff argues that the grant of summary judgment was premature because additional discovery was essential to \u201cexplore the relationship between National Envelope Corporation-East and National Envelope Corporation as to issue [sic] of successor liability and dual capacity.\u201d We affirm because discovery was complete and neither of these theories of liability, on the facts of this case, are sustainable as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-7\">At the November 5, 1999 hearing, after indicating the complaint would be amended to allege a \u201cdual capacity\u201d theory, plaintiffs counsel represented that discovery was complete and engaged in the following colloquy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>MR. EPSTEIN: Judge, no more discovery is needed. The dispute of material fact is on the record, whether [defense counsel] agrees with me or concedes to the fact that \u2014 to the items that [defense counsel] was mentioning. Even if he concedes the items [defense counsel] was mentioning, there\u2019s a dispute \u2014 there\u2019s enough evidence to show that a modification and alteration was made with regards to the machine.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-6\">THE COURT: You say no further discovery is necessary.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-7\">MR. EPSTEIN: Yes, Judge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-8\">THE COURT: So what you\u2019re asking for is an amendment as to the manufacturing and the intentional, you\u2019re \u2014 with no further discovery.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-9\">MR. EPSTEIN: Yes, Judge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-10\">THE COURT: So we\u2019re putting off to another day what \u2014 summary judgment, at which time you\u2019re going to brief this, perhaps, differently. Is that what you\u2019re saying?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-11\">MR. EPSTEIN: Exactly, Judge.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b621-12\">Indeed, by then the parties had been conducting substantial discovery for about one year and plaintiff never requested additional discovery. Discovery to date had established undisputably the chain of corporate acquisitions leading to the machine\u2019s placement with, and modification by, plaintiffs employer \u2014 namely, the \u201cpeel and seal\u201d attachment was designed and developed by NEC-East when it was known as Champion Envelope but sometime after it was acquired by NEC.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-13\">Although plaintiff makes a belated claim that more discovery was essential, she has given no indication as to what essential facts she believes would have justified a denial of defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment dismissing her complaint. \u201cWhen the incompleteness of discovery is raised as a defense to a motion for summary judgment, that party must establish that there is a likelihood that further discovery would supply the necessary information.\u201d <em>J. Josephson, Inc. v. Crum &amp; Forster Ins. Co., </em>293 <em>N.J.Super. </em>170, 204, 679 A.2d 1206 (App.Div.1996) (citing <em>Auster v. Kinoian, </em>153 <em>N.J.Super. </em>52, 56, 378 A.2d 1171 (App.Div.1977) (providing that where there has been a reasonable opportunity for discovery, the plaintiff has \u201can obligation to demonstrate with some degree of particularity the likelihood that further discovery will supply the missing elements of the cause of action\u201d)). Here all facts relevant to resolve the issues of \u201cdual capacity\u201d and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>\u201csuccessor\u201d liability as a matter of law had been fully developed and we are at a loss as to what information additional discovery might have revealed that would have made a difference.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-4\">Under these facts, plaintiff cannot avoid the effects of the Act\u2019s exclusivity bar by suing her employer in its capacity as a so-called \u201cmanufacturer\u201d of the machine. The \u201cdual capacity\u201d doctrine stands for the proposition that an employer normally shielded from tort liability by the exclusive remedy principle in Workers\u2019 Compensation may be liable in tort to its own employee if it occupies, in addition to its capacity as an employer, a second capacity that confers on it obligations independent of those imposed on him as an employer. <em>DeFigueiredo v. U.S. Metals Refining Co., </em>235 <em>N.J.Super. </em>458, 459, 563 A.2d 76 (Law Div.1988), <em>aff'd, </em>235 <em>N.J.Super. </em>407, 563 A.2d 50 (App.Div.1989) (quoting 2A Larson, <em>Law of Workmen\u2019s Compensation, </em>\u00a7 72.80 (1983)).</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">This doctrine as it may apply to employers in their capacities as property owners or manufacturers of plant equipment has been described as \u201cfundamentally unsound\u201d and rejected in a majority of jurisdictions because of its circumvention of the clear legislative mandate of workers\u2019 compensation law. <em>Billy v. Consolidated Machine Tool Corp., </em>51 N.Y.2d 152, 432 N.Y.S.2d 879, 883, 412 N.E.2d 934, 939 (1980). In New Jersey it is disfavored, if not outright disapproved. <em>DeFigueiredo v. U.S. Metals Refining Co., supra; Doe v. St. Michael\u2019s Medical Center, Newark, </em>184 <em>N.J.Super. </em>1, 8, 445 A.2d 40 (App.Div.1982); <em>Taylor v. Pfaudler Sybron Corp., </em>150 <em>N.J.Super. </em>48, 51, 374 A.2d 1222 (App.Div.1977), <em>certif. denied, </em>75 <em>N.J. </em>20, 379 A.2d 251 (1977); <em>Holliday v. Personal Products Co., </em>939 <em>F.Supp. </em>402 (E.D.Pa.1996), <em>aff'd, </em>114 F.3d 1172 (3d Cir.1997). Furthermore, no case in this State has ever invoked the \u201cdual capacity\u201d doctrine to impose common law liability on an employer who modifies or alters a machine used exclusively in its plant. As this court held in <em>DeFigueiredo v. U.S. Metals Refining Co., supra, </em>\u201c[w]hile the dual capacity doctrine may have viability in some circumstances, it is clearly inapplicable here, where the employee is injured during the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>course of his employment on the premises of the employer.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 408.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">Plaintiffs reliance on <em>Petrocco v. At &amp; T Teletype, Inc., </em>273 <em>N.J.Super. </em>613, 642 A.2d 1072 (Law Div.1994) is entirely misplaced. There, the exclusivity remedy was held not to bar an injured employee of the surviving parent corporation from suing a subsidiary corporation later absorbed into the corporate parent by merger, where the subsidiary corporation had manufactured an allegedly defective keyboard. The Law Division reasoned as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-7\">To allow the defendant to hide behind the exclusive remedy provision in this situation would effectively allow a manufacturer who had already put defective products into the stream of commerce to shield itself from injuries those products may later cause by virtue of subsequently entering into a business transaction with someone other than the injured party. The exclusive remedy provision of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act was not intended to immunize a third-parly manufacturer in such a situation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-8\"><em>[Id. </em>at 616, 642 A.2d 1072.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b623-9\">Thus, <em>Petrocco </em>informs that employers may be held liable for the torts of defunct \u201cthird-party manufacturers\u201d that had ceased to be third parties and had become unincorporated parts of the employer long before the injury occurred and indeed before the employment relationship even began.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-10\">The instant matter is clearly distinguishable. Unlike <em>Petrocco </em>where the employer and manufacturer of the machine were two <em>separate </em>corporations before the merger, here plaintiffs employer is the same entity that designed and developed the \u201cpeel and seal\u201d attachment on which she was injured. NEC-East is not a defunct third-party manufacturer. More significant, however, NEC-East did not introduce the Latex 1 machine into the stream of commerce or modify it other than solely for its own use and not for distribution to the general public. Under these circumstances, defendant NEC-East can neither be considered the de facto manufacturer of the allegedly defective \u201cpeel and seal\u201d attachment nor be sued in that capacity. <em>Vega v. Standard Machinery Co., </em>290 <em>N.J.Super. </em>434, 439, 675 A.2d 1194 (App.Div.1996) (holding employer not liable under a product liability theory for injuries <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>sustained by its employee from a machine obtained by employer in a merger with its wholly-owned subsidiary because the wholly-owned subsidiary neither manufactured nor placed into the stream of commerce the allegedly defective machine). For purposes of the Act\u2019s exclusivity bar, defendant NEC-East \u201cremains an employer in [its] relations with [its] employees as to all matters arising from and connected with their employment.\u201d <em>Billy v. Consolidated Machine Tool Corp., supra, </em>432 N.Y.S.2d at 883, 412 <em>N.E.2</em>d 934.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-4\">This same reasoning shields the parent company, NEC, from any common law liability as well. Even if we assume the modifications effectuated by Champion Envelope rendered its successor-in-name NEC-East a \u201cmanufacturer\u201d of the \u201cpeel and seal\u201d attachment, plaintiffs employer never undertook the distribution operation of the original manufacturer New Jersey Machine to warrant imposition of successor liability upon its parent, defendant NEC. <em>See Ramirez v. Amsted Industries Inc., </em>86 <em>N.J. </em>332, 359, 431 A.2d 811 (1981) (Schreiber, J. concurring); <em>Vega v. Standard Machinery Co., supra, </em>290 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 439, 675 A.2d 1194.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\"><em>Ramirez </em>formulated a general rule governing the strict tort liability of a successor corporation for damages caused by defects in products manufactured and distributed by its predecessor. <em>Id. </em>at 343-48, 431 A.2d 811. Illustrative is <em>Billy v. Consolidated Machine Tool Corp., supra. </em>There, the New York Court of Appeals allowed the widow of an employee killed by an allegedly-defective machine, after receiving workers\u2019 compensation, to sue the employer as the successor in interest to a subsidiary corporation it had absorbed by merger, where prior to the merger the subsidiary corporation had designed and manufactured the machine.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">Again, in the case at bar, NEC\u2019s subsidiary, Champion Envelope, had modified the Latex 1 machine before it had changed its name to NEC-East but after its acquisition by NEC in 1981. It was not a predecessor business and remains in operation, a party <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>to this lawsuit. Apart from these facts, NEC-East was neither a supplier nor a seller of the machine in the sense of an ordinary commercial or business transaction, <em>Vega v. Standard Machinery Co., supra, </em>290 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 439, 675 A.2d 1194, much less a distributor introducing the \u201cpeel and seal\u201d attachment into the stream of commerce for purposes of imposing successor liability vicariously on its parent defendant NEC. <em>Ramirez v. Amsted Industries Inc., supra, </em>86 <em>N.J. </em>at 359, 431 A.2d 811 (Schreiber, J. concurring). Lastly, there is no proof in this record that defendant NEC ever committed a single independent act with respect to the Latex 1 machine to pierce its corporate veil or otherwise hold it directly liable for any alleged defect. <em>Volb v.
