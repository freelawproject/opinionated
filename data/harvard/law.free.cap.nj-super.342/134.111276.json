(Dendrite), on leave granted, appeals from an interlocutory order of the trial court denying its request to conduct limited expedited discovery for the purpose of ascertaining the identity of defendant, John Doe No. 3, from Yahoo!, an ISP. Here, the posting of certain comments about Dendrite on a Yahoo! bulletin board by defendant, John Doe No. 3, forms the basis of the dispute in this appeal in the context of a cause of action based on Dendrite\u2019s claims of defamation.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We affirm the denial of Dendrite\u2019s motion based on the conclusion of the motion judge that Dendrite failed to establish harm resulting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>from John Doe No. 3\u2019s statements as an element of its defamation claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">We offer the following guidelines to trial courts when faced with an application by a plaintiff for expedited discovery seeking an order compelling an ISP to honor a subpoena and disclose the identity of anonymous Internet posters who are sued for allegedly violating the rights of individuals, corporations or businesses. The trial court must consider and decide those applications by striking a balance between the well-established First Amendment right to speak anonymously, and the right of the plaintiff to protect its proprietary interests and reputation through the assertion of recognizable claims based on the actionable conduct of the anonymous, fictitiously-named defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-7\">We hold that when such an application is made, the trial court should first require the plaintiff to undertake efforts to notify the anonymous posters that they are the subject of a subpoena or application for an order of disclosure, and withhold action to afford the fictitiously-named defendants a reasonable opportunity to file and serve opposition to the application. These notification efforts should include posting a message of notification of the identity discovery request to the anonymous user on the ISP\u2019s pertinent message board.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-8\">The court shall also require the plaintiff to identify and set forth the exact statements purportedly made by each anonymous poster that plaintiff alleges constitutes actionable speech.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-9\"> The complaint and all information provided to the court should be carefully reviewed to determine whether plaintiff has set forth a prima facie cause of action against the fictitiously-named anonymous defendants. In addition to establishing that its action can withstand a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted pursuant to <em>R. </em>4:6 \u2014 2(f), the plaintiff must produce sufficient evidence supporting each element of its cause of action, on a prima facie basis, prior to a court ordering the disclosure of the identity of the unnamed defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>Finally, assuming the court concludes that the plaintiff has presented a prima facie cause of action, the court must balance the defendant\u2019s First Amendment right of anonymous free speech against the strength of the prima facie case presented and the necessity for the disclosure of the anonymous defendant\u2019s identity to allow the plaintiff to properly proceed.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">The application of these procedures and standards must be undertaken and analyzed on a case-by-case basis. The guiding principle is a result based on a meaningful analysis and a proper balancing of the equities and rights at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">With these principles in mind, we now turn to an analysis of Dendrite\u2019s action against John Doe No. 3 and the trial court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-7\">Dendrite is a New Jersey corporation based in Morristown that provides \u201chighly specialized integrated product and service offerings for the Pharmaceutical and Consumer Package Goods (CPG) industries.\u201d Dendrite is publicly traded and has offices located in 21 countries.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-8\">\u201cThe Internet is an international network of interconnected computers!,]\u201d providing \u201ca unique and wholly new medium of world-wide human communication.\u201d <em>Reno v. American Civil Liberties Union, </em>521 <em>U.S. </em>844, 849-50, 117 <em>S.Ct. </em>2329, 2334, 138 <em>L. </em>Ed.2d 874, 884 (1997). In further describing the Internet and the services available, the Supreme Court noted, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-9\">Individuals can obtain access to the Internet from many different sources, generally hosts themselves or entities with a host affiliation---- Several major national \u201conline services\u201d ... offer access to their own extensive proprietary networks as well as a link to the much larger resources of the Internet____ Anyone with access to the Internet may take advantage of a wide variety of communication and information retrieval methods____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-14\">The best known category of communication over the Internet is the World Wide Web, which allows users to search for and retrieve information stored in remote computers, as well as, in some eases, to communicate back to designated sites. In concrete terms, the Web consists of a vast number of documents stored in different computers all over the world____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>The Web is thus comparable, from the reader\u2019s viewpoint, to both a vast library including millions of readily available and indexed publications and a sprawling mall offering goods and services.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-6\">From the publishers\u2019 point of view, it constitutes a vast platform from which to address and hear from a worldwide audience of millions of readers, viewers, researchers, and buyers. Any person or organization with a computer connected to the Internet can \u201cpublish\u201d information. Publishers include government agencies, educational institutions, commercial entities, advocacy groups, and individuals. Publishers may either make their material available to the entire pool of Internet users, or confine access to a selected group, such as those willing to pay for the privilege. \u201cNo single organization controls any membership in the Web, nor is there any single centralized point from which individual Web sites or services can be blocked from the Web.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-7\"><em>[Id. </em>521 <em>U.S. </em>at 850-53, 117 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2334-36, 138 <em>L. </em>Ed.2d at 884-86. (citations and footnotes omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b173-8\">Yahoo! is an ISP that, among other things, provides a service where users may post comments on bulletin and message boards related to the financial matters of particular companies. Yahoo! maintains a message board for every publicly-traded company and permits anyone to post messages on it. As such, Yahoo! operates a bulletin board specifically devoted to Dendrite, hosting exchanges of messages and comments about issues related to the company\u2019s stock performance. Generally, users of the bulletin boards post messages anonymously under pseudonyms. Yahoo! requires, however, that users provide identifying information, including real names, mailing addresses, and e-mail addresses prior to using the service. Nonetheless, Yahoo! guarantees to a certain extent that information about the identity of their individual subscribers will be kept confidential. Yahool\u2019s privacy policy states that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-9\">As a general rule, Yahoo! will not disclose any of your personally identifiable information except when we have your permission or under special circumstances, such as when we believe in good faith that the law requires it or under the circumstances described below.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-10\">Yahoo! may also disclose account information in special cases when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be violating Yahool\u2019s Terms of Service or may be causing injury to ... anyone ... that could be harmed by such activities.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b174-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>The postings by John Doe No. 3 on the Yahoo! Dendrite message board must be viewed in the following context. Dendrite filed its Quarterly Report for the second quarter of 1999 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in August of 1999. In this report, Dendrite stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-5\">Historically, we have generally recognized license fees as revenue using the percentage of completion method over a period of time that begins with execution of the license agreement and ends with the completion of initial customization and installation, if any. However, we believe that with some of our newer sales force software products, such as, ForcePharma and SalesPlus, our customers will not require customization and therefore we may be able to recognize license fees from these products upon delivery.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">Following the release of this report, several stock analysts commented on the disclosures therein. The Center for Financial Research and Analysis, Inc. (CFRA) issued a report in September 1999 specifically addressing what it characterized as Dendrite\u2019s \u201cChange in Revenue Recognition.\u201d The CFRA report concluded that due to the apparent change indicated in its Quarterly Report, Dendrite\u2019s revenue recognition would provide an earnings boost and was actually one of the reasons for Dendrite\u2019s then-improved financial condition. Further, the CFRA report opined that the associated earnings boost may have \u201cmasked weaknesses in the company\u2019s core segment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b174-7\">An Internet website, \u201cTheStreet.com,\u201d published a similar article concerning Dendrite in September 1999, also responding to Dendrite\u2019s Quarterly Report. There, TheStreet.com noted several \u201cred flags\u201d about Dendrite, including its \u201cmore aggressive recognition of revenue.\u201d The author of the article stated that this change in Dendrite\u2019s revenue recognition policy \u201ccould mean more revenue up front.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b174-8\">Thereafter, at least two users of the Yahoo! Dendrite bulletin board mentioned the CFRA report and the article from TheStreet.com in respective postings. On September 21, 1999 one poster, citing the CFRA report, commented on Dendrite\u2019s purported accounting and operational problems. On September 22, 1999 another poster, citing TheStreet.com article, noted changes in Dendrite\u2019s policy of recognizing revenue. Sometime after the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>CFRA report was released Dendrite responded, denying it changed its revenue recognition policy as asserted in the CFRA report.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">During the period from March 14, 2000 through June 2, 2000 John Doe No. 3, posted nine comments on the Yahoo! Dendrite bulletin board under the pseudonym \u201cxxplrr.\u201d Three of these comments related to purported changes in Dendrite\u2019s revenue recognition accounting. Specifically, these comments included the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-7\">John\u2019s [ (Dendrite president John Bailye) ] got his contracts salted away to buy another year of earnings \u2014 and note how they\u2019re changing revenue recognition accounting to help it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-8\">Bailye has his established contracts structured to provide a nice escalation in revenue. And then he\u2019s been changing his revenue-recognition accounting to further boost his earnings (see about 100 posts back).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-9\">[Dendrite] signed multi-year deals with built in escalation in their revenue year-over-year (pharma cares most about total price of the contract, so they don\u2019t care; nor do they care if the price is in software or services). They also have been able to restructure their contracts with Pfizer and Lilly the same way.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b175-10\">The certification of Dendrite Vice President, R. Bruce Savage, submitted in support of Dendrite\u2019s discovery application, asserts that the substanee of these statements are categorically false, specifically averring that Dendrite did not change its revenue recognition policy, nor are Dendrite\u2019s contracts structured to defer income.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-11\">Dendrite also takes issue with the following March 28, 2000 posting by John Doe No. 3:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-12\">[Dendrite] simply does not appear to be competitively moving forward. John [Bailye, Dendrite\u2019s president] knows it and is shopping hard. But Siebel and SAP already have turned him down. Hope Oracle does want in bad (and that\u2019s why they\u2019ll get). But it doesn\u2019t help job prospects in Morristown any does it?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b175-13\">Dendrite contends this statement falsely asserts Dendrite was secretly and unsuccessfully \u201cshopping\u201d the company. Dendrite states John Doe No. 3\u2019s claims that Dendrite is not competitive, that its president is aware of this and is trying to sell the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>company, and that the company is not desirable to potential purchasers, are all false.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">In light of these statements, and those posted by other Yahoo! bulletin board users, Dendrite filed a verified complaint on May 24, 2000 against numerous fictitiously-named John Doe defendants, including John Doe No. 3. The complaint alleged that certain postings on the Yahoo! Dendrite bulletin board constituted breaches of contract, defamatory statements and misappropriated trade secrets. Relevant to this appeal, the complaint alleged that the aforementioned messages posted by John Doe No. 3 defamed Dendrite and misappropriated trade secrets.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">Since most participants on the Yahoo! Dendrite bulletin board identified themselves through the use of pseudonyms unrelated to their actual identities, Dendrite sought an order to show cause why Dendrite should not be granted leave to conduct limited discovery for the purpose of ascertaining the true identity of the John Doe defendants Nos. 1 through 4. Accordingly, on June 20, 2000 the trial court issued an order directing these John Doe defendants to show cause why the relief requested by Dendrite should not be granted. The order further directed that this same notice be posted on the Yahoo! Dendrite bulletin board.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-7\">In the interim, the Public Citizen Litigation Group of Washington, D.C. filed a motion for leave to file a brief as <em>amicus curiae. </em>The trial court granted the motion and permitted the organization\u2019s participation.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-8\">On July 28, 2000 the motion judge heard argument on the order to show cause. At the close of argument, the judge reserved decision on Dendrite\u2019s motion to compel discovery purportedly necessary to identify these John Doe defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-9\">On November 23, 2000, the motion judge issued a detailed written opinion, granting Dendrite\u2019s motion to conduct limited <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>discovery to ascertain the identities of John Doe defendants Nos. 1 and 2, but denied the motion as to John Doe defendants Nos. 3 and 4. In reaching his decision, the judge stated, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-6\">The Court has been called upon to balance an individual's right to anonymously voice their opinions against a plaintiffs right to confront his accusers... Dendrite has not made a prima facie case of defamation against John Doe No. 3, as Dendrite has failed to demonstrate that it was harmed by any of the posted messages. Dendrite has also failed to provide this Court with ample proof from which to conclude that John Does Nos. 3 and 4 have used their constitutional protections in order to conduct themselves in a manner which is unlawful or that would warrant this Court to revoke their constitutional protections. Therefore, Dendrite\u2019s request for limited expedited discovery, including the issuance of a commission to take discovery out-of-state is denied.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b177-7\">The conclusions of the judge were memorialized in an order executed on December 13, 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-8\">By order entered on January 31, 2001, we granted Dendrite\u2019s motion for leave to appeal from that portion of the December 13, 2000 order denying limited discovery as to John Doe No. 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-9\">On appeal, Dendrite presents the following arguments for our consideration:</p>\n<p id=\"b177-10\">\n<em>POINT I</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b177-11\">DISCOVERY OF THE IDENTITIES OF FICTITIOUS NAMED DEFENDANTS IS PERMISSIBLE UNDER BLACK LETTER NEW JERSEY LAW. <em>POINT II</em></p>\n<p id=\"b177-12\">PLAINTIFFS DEFAMATION CLAIM AGAINST JOHN DOE NO. 3 CAN WITHSTAND A DISMISSAL MOTION AND, ACCORDINGLY, DISCOVERY OF HIS IDENTITY IS WARRANTED.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-13\">A. Dendrite Adequately Plead Harm to Survive a Motion to Dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-14\">B. As a Matter of Pleading, Dendrite Is Not Required to Allege Harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-15\">C. The Lower Court Erred to the Extent It Used a De Facto Summary Judgment Standard to Reject Dendrite\u2019s Defamation Claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-16\">\n<em>POINT III</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b177-17\">JOHN DOES ARE NOT ENTITLED TO SPECIAL DISCOVERY RULES TO PREVENT PLAINTIFF FROM DISCOVERING THEIR IDENTITIES.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-18\">A. Defendants Are Not Entitled to Imposition of an Unduly Burdensome Proof Standard at the Initial Stage of This Lawsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-19\">B. Requests <em>for </em>Disclosure of Defendants\u2019 True Identities Are Granted Routinely in Similar Cases Involving Subpoenas to Internet Service Providers.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-20\">C. Defendants Receive Little or No Privacy in Exchange for Their Use of Yahoo\u2019s Financial Bulletin Board and Other Services.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>D. Defendant\u2019s Tortious Conduct Is Not Protected by the First Amendment and Does Not Warrant Imposition of Any Special Discovery Rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">It is well-established that rights afforded by the First Amendment remain protected even when engaged in anonymously. <em>Buckley v.

California, </em>362 <em>U.S., </em>at 64, 80 <em>S.Ct., </em>at 538. Great works of literature have frequently been produced by authors writing under assumed names. Despite readers\u2019 curiosity and the public\u2019s interest in identifying the creator of a work of art, an author generally is free to decide whether or not to disclose his or her true identity. The decision in favor of anonymity may be motivated by fear of economic or official retaliation, by concern about social ostracism, or merely by a desire to preserve as much of one\u2019s privacy as possible. Whatever the motivation may be, at least in the field of literary endeavor, the interest in having anonymous works enter the marketplace of ideas unquestionably outweighs any public interest in requiring disclosure as a condition of entry. Accordingly, an author\u2019s decision to remain anonymous, like other decisions concerning omissions or additions to the content of a publication, is an aspect of the freedom of speech protected by the First Amendment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-7\"><em>[McIntyre, supra, </em>514 <em>U.S. </em>at 341-42, 115 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1516, 131 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 436.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b178-8\">In <em>Buckley, supra, </em>525 <em>U.S. </em>at 197-98, 119 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 645-46, 142 L.Ed.2d at 606-08, the Court addressed a Colorado statute that required distributors of political petitions campaign materials to wear identifying badges and file affidavits disclosing their identity.

In fact, \u201cthe reach of our constitutional provision [is] affirmative.

Dendrite asserts this burden of proof is contrary to the recognized standards applicable to motions to dismiss, which require a judge to look liberally upon a complaint at the pleading stage. Moreover, Dendrite contends harm is not an element that must be pled in a defamation action, and if it is a required element of the pleading, then it has in fact sufficiently pled that element.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">In light of free speech and defamation considerations, as well as the fact that the Internet played a role in this dispute, the motion judge relied on the case of <em>Columbia Ins. Co., v. Seescandy.Com, </em>185 <em>F.R.D. </em>573 (N.D.Cal.1999) to resolve whether he should permit Dendrite to conduct discovery to ascertain John Doe No. 3\u2019s identity. In <em>Seescandy.Com, </em>the Federal District Court for the Northern District of California addressed whether it should authorize limited discovery so that plaintiff could ascertain defendant\u2019s identity so as to effectuate service. <em>Id. </em>at 575. There, the unknown defendant had registered an Internet domain name, \u201cseescandy.com.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 575-76. Plaintiff, the assignee of various trademarks related to the operation of \u201cSee\u2019s Candy Shops, Inc.\u201d, sued the unknown defendants alleging that in registering that domain name the unknown defendant infringed on federally registered trademarks. <em>Id. </em>at 576. However, the actual identity of the defendant who registered the domain name was unknown to plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>Although the <em>Seescandy.Com </em>case did not implicate defendant\u2019s free speech rights, as alleged here, the District Court recognized the unique circumstances created by the advent of the Internet and noted the following in regards to disclosing the identity of unknown Internet users:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-6\">With the rise of the Internet has come the ability to commit certain tortious acts, such as defamation, copyright infringement, and trademark infringement, entirely on-line. The tortfeasor can act pseudonymously or anonymously and may give fictitious or incomplete identifying information. Parties who have been injured by these acts are likely to find themselves chasing the tortfeasor from Internet Service Provider (ISP) to ISP, with little or no hope of actually discovering the identity of the tortfeasor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-7\">In such cases the traditional reluctance for permitting filings against John Doe defendants or fictitious names and the traditional enforcement of strict compliance with service requirements should be tempered by the need to provide injured parties with a forum in which they may seek redress for grievances. However, this need must be balanced against the legitimate and valuable right to participate in online forums anonymously or pseudonymously. People are permitted to interact pseudonymously and anonymously with each other so long as those acts are not in violation of the law. This ability to speak one\u2019s mind without the burden of the other party knowing all the facts about one\u2019s identity can foster open communication and robust debate. Furthermore, it permits persons to obtain information relevant to a sensitive or intimate condition without fear of embarrassment. People who have committed no wrong should be able to participate online without fear that someone who wishes to harass or embarrass them can file a frivolous lawsuit and thereby gain the power of the court\u2019s order to discover their identity.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-8\"><em>[Id. </em>at 578 (footnote omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b181-9\">In light of the particularly unique arena of discussion and communication created by the Internet forum, the District Court imposed certain limiting principles on \u201cwhether discovery to uncover the identity of a defendant is warranted\u201d under such circumstances. <em>Id. </em>at 578. The court outlined a four-prong approach to this issue seeking to \u201censure that this unusual procedure will only be employed in cases where the plaintiff has in good faith exhausted traditional avenues for identifying a civil defendant pre-service, and will prevent use of this method to harass or intimidate.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b181-10\">\u201cFirst, the plaintiff should identify the missing party with sufficient specificity such that the Court can determine that defendant is a real person or entity who could be sued in federal court.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Second, plaintiff must \u201cidentify all previous steps taken to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>locate the elusive defendant\u201d to demonstrate that plaintiffs have made a good-faith effort to comply with the requirements of service of process. <em>Id. </em>at 579. Third, and most relevant to this appeal, \u201cplaintiff should establish to the Court\u2019s satisfaction that plaintiffs suit against defendant could withstand a motion to dismiss.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Fourth, the moving \u201cplaintiff should file a request for discovery with the Court, along with a statement of reasons justifying the specific discovery requested as well as identification of a limited number of persons or entities on whom discovery process might be served and for which there is a reasonable likelihood that the discovery process will lead to identifying information about defendant that would make service of process possible.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 580.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">Relying on <em>Seescandy.Com, </em>the motion judge reasoned that Dendrite did not satisfy the third prong-the ability to withstand a motion to dismiss-because it failed to make out a prima facie case of defamation against John Doe No. 3. Accordingly, the judge concluded Dendrite was not entitled to conduct limited discovery to ascertain the identity of John Doe No. 3. Specifically, the judge found Dendrite failed to show that the statements posted by John Doe No. 3 caused Dendrite any harm.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Dendrite contends the motion judge imposed an excessively demanding burden of proof, generally not required when defending a motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">Dendrite cites to <em>Printing Mart-Morristown v. Sharp Electronics Corp., </em>116 <em>N.J. </em>739, 563 A.2d 31 (1989) to support this contention. There, our Supreme Court reviewed, in part, whether we properly upheld dismissal of a plaintiffs defamation claim for a failure to state a cause of action. <em>Id. </em>at 744, 563 A.2d 31. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>Court initially established that the review of plaintiffs\u2019 pleadings on a motion to dismiss are entitled to deference, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-6\">We approach our review of the judgment below mindful of the test for determining the adequacy of a pleading: whether a cause of action is \u201csuggested\u201d by the facts. In reviewing a complaint dismissed under Rule 4:6-2(e) our inquiry is limited to examining the legal sufficiency of the facts alleged on the face of the complaint. However, a reviewing court \u201csearches the complaint in depth and with liberality to ascertain whether the fundament of a cause of action may be gleaned even from an obscure statement of claim, opportunity being given to amend if necessary.\u201d At this preliminary stage of the litigation the Court is not concerned with the ability of plaintiffs to prove the allegation contained in the complaint. For purposes of analysis plaintiffs are entitled to every reasonable inference of fact. The examination of a complaint\u2019s allegations of fact required by the aforestated principles should be one that is at once painstaking and undertaken with a generous and hospitable approach.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-7\"><em>[Id. </em>at 746, 563 A.2d 31 (citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b183-8\">The Court reversed, finding three of six contested statements made by defendants were \u201copen to a defamatory meaning and actionable on their face.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 766, 563 A.2d 31. Those three statements asserted plaintiffs were (1) \u201c \u2018ripping off \u201d clients; (2) plaintiffs \u201c \u2018were not qualified to do the work for defendant ... (if stated as fact rather than merely as opinion, an issue to be determined at trial)\u201d; and (3) that plaintiffs \u201cdid unreasonably-priced, inadequate work.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The Court found the import of these statements to be clear, and concluded \u201cthat those statements could not be held as a matter of law to be <em>not </em>defamatory.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 766-67, 563 A.2d 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-9\">Dendrite\u2019s verified complaint alleges, in relevant part, the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-10\">46. Defendants\u2019 publication of these statements has caused irreparable harm to Dendrite for which Dendrite has no adequate remedy at law, and will continue to cause such irreparable harm unless restrained by this Court. In addition, as a proximate result of defendants\u2019 publication of these statements, Dendrite has sustained harm to its business reputation resulting in damages in an amount to be proven at trial, and Dendrite will continue to suffer additional damages in the future according to proof.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-11\">47. Dendrite is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that defendants\u2019 publication of these statements was willful, malicious and oppressive, in that they intended to harm the business reputation of Dendrite. These acts, therefore, justify awarding of punitive damages.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b184-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>In addition, the complaint highlights the postings made by John Doe No. 3, which asserted Dendrite had changed its revenue recognition policy and that Dendrite was \u201cshopping\u201d the company.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">Dendrite argues that in applying the motion-to-dismiss standard, the motion judge ignored the Court\u2019s direction to review pleadings on motions to dismiss with liberality and generosity and, instead, applied a de facto summary judgment standard. Dendrite asserts the judge mistakenly concluded that Dendrite must <em>prove </em>\u201cactual reputational injury\u201d in its complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">Our review of the motion judge\u2019s analysis of the harm/injury element of Dendrite\u2019s defamation claim reveals he required more evidentiary support for the pleading than is traditionally required when applying motion-to-dismiss standards. The judge relied on <em>McLaughlin v. Rosanio, Bailets &amp; Talamo, Inc., </em>331 <em>N.J.Super. </em>303, 751 A.2d 1066 (App.Div.2000), as the basis for outlining the requirement for a defamation cause of action. However, it is clear the judge implemented an analysis that relied on more than a motion-to-dismiss standard, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-7\">It is not obvious that the statements at issue are false or that Dendrite has been harmed. Dendrite has <em>failed to show </em>that the messages in question in any way harmed Dendrite. Although Dendrite alleges that it has been harmed and that it will continue to be harmed by the defendants\u2019 statements, saying it is so does not make the alleged harm a <em>verifiable reality. </em>In his reply certification, Michael Vogel, Dendrite\u2019s counsel, attempts to link the messages posted in this case to a drop in Dendrite\u2019s stock price____Furthermore, Mr. Vogel has not purported to be an expert in the field of stock valuation and analysis, thus, <em>he cannot draio the conclusion that the fluctuations in Dendrite\u2019s stock prices are anything more than coincidence.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-10\">Despite the fact that Plaintiff is entitled to every reasonable inference of fact in this analysis of whether a ease against John Doe No. 3 could survive dismissal, the Court will not take the leap to linking messages posted on an Internet message board regarding individual opinions, albeit incorrect opinions, to a decrease in stock prices <em>unthout something more concrete.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-11\">[(Emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b184-12\">This analysis reveals that the motion judge engaged in a more probing review of Dendrite\u2019s complaint and pleadings than outlined in <em>Printing Mart, </em>requiring specific proof establishing Dendrite\u2019s harm as an element of its defamation claim. The judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>found Dendrite had not established that fluctuations in its stock prices were a result of John Doe No. 3\u2019s postings, and could not find any nexus between the postings and the drop in Dendrite\u2019s stock prices.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">\u201cIn the case of a complaint charging defamation, plaintiff must plead facts sufficient to identify the defamatory words, their utterer and the fact of their publication.\u201d <em>Zoneraich v. Overlook Hosp., </em>212 <em>N.J.Super. </em>83, 101, 514 A.2d 53 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>107 <em>N.J. </em>32, 526 A.2d 126 (1986). Here, Dendrite has (1) identified the \u201crevenue recognition\u201d and \u201cshopping\u201d statements as purportedly defamatory words, (2) identified \u201cxxplrr\u201d (John Doe No. 3) as the utterer, and (3) established that they were in fact published on Yahool\u2019s bulletin board. Accordingly, Dendrite meets the bare minimum requirements for a defamation cause of action, and would survive a motion to dismiss under the traditional application of <em>R. </em>4:6-2(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b185-7\">However, application of our motion-to-dismiss standard in isolation fails to provide a basis for an analysis and balancing of Dendrite\u2019s request for disclosure in light of John Doe No. 3\u2019s competing right of anonymity in the exercise of his right of free speech.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-8\">We first note that the motion judge was not presented with an actual motion to dismiss and, as such, was not necessarily bound to a dogmatic application of the associated rales. Nonetheless, the third prong of the <em>Seescandy.Com </em>test requires a showing that plaintiffs claim would survive a motion to dismiss. However, a closer analysis discloses that the District Court distinguished the actual application of the third prong of the test from the traditional application of a motion-to-dismiss standard, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-9\">Pre-service discovery is akin to the process used during criminal investigations to obtain warrants. The requirement that the government show probable cause is, in part, a protection against the misuse of <em>ex parte </em>procedures to invade the privacy of one who has done no wrong. A similar requirement is necessary here to prevent abuse of this extraordinary application of the discovery process and to ensure that plaintiff has standing to pursue an action against defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-10\"><em>[Seescandy.Com, supra, </em>185 <em>F.R.D. </em>at 579-80.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b186-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>Probable cause as it relates to obtaining warrants is a nontechnical, flexible concept that does not require rigid, \u201ctechnical demands for specificity and precision[.]\u201d <em>State v. Boyd, </em>44 <em>N.J. </em>390, 392-93, 209 A.2d 134 (1965); <em>Ornelas v. United States, </em>517 <em>U.S. </em>690, 695-96, 116 <em>S.Ct. </em>1657, 1661, 134 <em>L. </em>Ed.2d 911, 918 (1996). The District Court added that by equating this prong to the probable cause requirement for warrants, \u201cplaintiff <em>must make some showing </em>that an act giving rise to civil liability actually occurred and that the discovery is aimed at revealing specific identifying features of the person or entity who committed the act.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 580 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">In fact, the literal reading of the third prong of the <em>Seescandy.Com </em>test, as worded by the District Court, supports such a flexible, non-technical application of the motion to dismiss standard. Specifically, the third prong provides \u201cplaintiff should establish to <em>the Court\u2019s satisfaction </em>that plaintiffs suit against defendant could withstand a motion to dismiss.\u201d <em>Seescandy.Com, supra, </em>185 <em>F.R.D. </em>at 579 (emphasis added). The court characterized the four-prong test as \u201csafeguards,\u201d necessary to \u201cprevent [plaintiffs from] harrass[ing] or intimidating]\u201d anonymous persons on the Internet. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">Our review of <em>Seescandy.Com </em>discloses that a strict application of our rules surrounding motions to dismiss is not the appropriate litmus test to apply in evaluating the disclosure issue. We conclude that the District Court envisioned this four-part test to act as a flexible, non-technical, fact-sensitive mechanism for courts to use as a means of ensuring that plaintiffs do not use discovery procedures to ascertain the identities of unknown defendants in order to harass, intimidate or silence critics in the public forum opportunities presented by the Internet.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-7\">Analogous circumstances were recently presented to the Virginia Circuit Court in <em>In re Subpoena Duces Tecum to America Online, Inc., </em>2000 WL 1210372, *1 (Va. Cir. Ct. Jan.31, 2000). There, a publicly traded company sought and obtained an order from an Indiana court authorizing plaintiff to conduct discovery in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>order to ascertain the identities of certain John Does who posted allegedly defamatory comments on a stock-trading Internet chat room maintained by America Online (AOL). AOL refused to voluntarily comply with the order to disclose its subscribers\u2019 identities, contending disclosure of the subscribers\u2019 identities pursuant to the subpoena would impair the subscribers\u2019 First Amendment rights to speak anonymously. <em>Id. </em>at *2. Ultimately, the circuit court ordered AOL to disclose the identities, establishing a test functionally similar to that put forth in <em>Seescandy.Com, </em>as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-6\">[AJ court should only order a non-party, Internet service provider to provide information concerning the identity of a subscriber (1) when the court is satisfied by the pleadings or evidence supplied to that court (2) that the party requesting the subpoena has a legitimate, good faith basis to contend that it may be the victim of conduct actionable in the jurisdiction where suit was filed and (3) the subpoenaed identity information is centrally needed to advance that claim.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-7\"><em>[Id. </em>at *8.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b187-8\">The test created by the Virginia Circuit Court departed from that state\u2019s traditional legal standard applied when ruling on a motion to quash a subpoena. <em>Id. </em>at *2, *7. Although the Circuit Court ordered disclosure of the identities of the John Doe defendants, it found a more probing evaluation into the \u201cbona fides of [plaintiffs] claim was necessary in order to properly evaluate the reasonableness of the subpoena request in light of all the surrounding circumstances.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at *8.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-9\">The Virginia case supports the notion that when evaluating a plaintiff\u2019s request to compel an ISP to disclose the identity of a John Doe subscriber, courts may depart from traditionally-applied legal standards in analyzing the appropriateness of such disclosure in light of the First Amendment implications.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-10\">Here, although Dendrite\u2019s defamation claims would survive a traditional motion to dismiss for failure to state a cause of action, we conclude the motion judge appropriately reviewed Dendrite\u2019s claim with a level of scrutiny consistent with the procedures and standards we adopt here today and, therefore, the judge properly found Dendrite should not be permitted to conduct limited discov<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>ery aimed at disclosing John Doe No. 3\u2019s identity. Moreover, the motion judge\u2019s approach is consistent with the approach by both the District Court in <em>Seescandy.Com, </em>and by the Virginia Circuit Court in the <em>America Online </em>decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">A defamatory statement is one that is false and 1) injures another person\u2019s reputation; 2) subjects the person to hatred, contempt or ridicule; or 3) causes others to lose good will or confidence in that person. <em>Romaine v. Kallinger, </em>109 <em>N.J. </em>282, 289, 537 A.2d 284 (1988). A defamatory statement harms the reputation of another in a way that lowers the estimation of the community about that person or deters third persons from associating or dealing with him. <em>McLaughlin v. Rosanio, supra, </em>331 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 312, 751 A.2d 1066; <em>Restatement (Second) of Torts </em>\u00a7 559 (1977). \u2018Words that clearly denigrate a person\u2019s reputation are defamatory on their face and actionable <em>per se.\u201d Printing Mart-Morristown, supra, </em>116 <em>N.J. </em>at 765, 563 A.2d 31. When determining if a statement is defamatory on its face \u201ca court must scrutinize the language \u2018according to the fair and natural meaning which will be given it by reasonable persons of ordinary intelligence.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(quoting <em>Romaine, supra, </em>109 <em>N.J. </em>at 290, 537 A.2d 284). A plaintiff does not make a prima facie claim of defamation if the contested statement is essentially true. <em>Hill v. Evening News Co., </em>314 <em>N.J.Super. </em>545, 552, 715 A.2d 999 (App. Div.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">The motion judge determined that Dendrite failed to demonstrate the statements posted by John Doe No. 3 caused it any harm. The certification of Dendrite Vice President, Bruce Savage alleges John Doe No. 3\u2019s postings <em>\u201cmay ... </em>have a significant deleterious effect on Dendrite\u2019s ability to hire and keep employees.\u201d (Emphasis added). Dendrite also contends that John Doe No. 3\u2019s postings caused detrimental fluctuations in its stock prices.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-7\">Dendrite\u2019s NASDAQ trading records were submitted to the court for the period of March 1, 2000 through June 15, 2000. Those records indicate Dendrite experienced gains on 32 days, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>losses on 40 days, and no change on two days during that period, which overlaps the period when John Doe No. 3 was posting his statements on the Yahoo! bulletin board. Dendrite\u2019s total loss during this period was of a point.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">Moreover, John Doe No. 3 made nine postings, two on the same day. On three of the days that immediately followed a posting by John Doe No. 3, Dendrite\u2019s stock value decreased. However, on five of the days that immediately followed a posting by John Doe No. 3, Dendrite\u2019s stock value increased. The net change in Dendrite\u2019s stock value over those seven days was actually an increase of 3 and <em>% </em>points.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-7\">Although the motion judge stated Dendrite was \u201centitled to every reasonable inference of fact in this analysis[,]\u201d he refused to \u201ctake the leap to linking messages posted on an internet message board regarding individual opinions, albeit incorrect opinions, to a decrease in stock prices without something more concrete.\u201d The record does not support the conclusion that John Doe\u2019s postings negatively affected the value of Dendrite\u2019s stock, nor does Dendrite offer evidence or information that these postings have actually inhibited its hiring practices, as it alleged they would. Accordingly, the motion judge appropriately concluded that Dendrite failed to establish a sufficient nexus between John Doe No. 3\u2019s statements and Dendrite\u2019s allegations of harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-8\">We are satisfied that the analysis and conclusions by Judge MacKenzie set forth in his comprehensive letter opinion dated November 23, 2000 are supported by the record. Dendrite has failed to establish that the judge abused his discretion in entering the December 13, 2000 order.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-9\">Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b170-10\"> The complaint filed by Dendrite against a number of f\u00edctit\u00edousiy-named defendants, including John Doe No. 3, alleged various claims for breach of contract, defamation and other actionable statements on the Yahoo! bulletin board. Although the trial court issued decisions on Dendrite's request for information concerning the identity of all fictitiously-named defendants, this appeal focuses solely on the court's denial of Dendrite's application for expedited discovery disclosing the identity of John Doe No. 3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b176-10\"> In this appeal. Dendrite bases its application seeking disclosure of John Doe No. 3\u2019s identity on its contention that John Doe No. 3's posted messages constitute actionable defamation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b182-7\"> The judge found the first prong satisfied because \"the assumption that this court has jurisdiction and that venue is proper is not unfounded, and, without evidence to the contrary, jurisdiction will be presumed.\u201d Regarding the second prong he found \"Dendrite has not provided the Court with any previously taken steps aimed at locating the defendants[;]\u201d however, the judge reasoned Dendrite could not have been expected to know they were supposed to attempt to identify the defendants on their own since he had just invoked the <em>Seescandy.Com </em>test. Lastly, the judge made no findings concerning the fourth prong of the test.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
