Wiseman, found that the Tennessee trial court had not made an adequate due process determination of petitioner\u2019s competency to stand trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-4\">On March 19, 1975, Osborne pleaded guilty in Knox County, Tennessee, Criminal Court to each of five separate indictments, charging first degree burglary, second degree burglary, third degree burglary, attempt to commit a felony, and grand larceny. Prior to the plea, the trial court had granted petitioner\u2019s motion for a psychiatric examination to determine petitioner\u2019s competency to stand trial. On March 6, 1975, a written psychiatric report had been filed stating that petitioner was \u201cmarginally\u201d competent to understand the charges brought against him, and to aid in his defense. The report had also disclosed that petitioner had a chronic mental illness and was being maintained on medication.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">After petitioner pleaded guilty, the trial judge reserved imposition of judgment for four months. On May 22, 1975, before the four months expired, petitioner was returned to the Criminal Court. Based on his conduct, incoherence, obvious emotional instability and low intelligence, the state court declared him \u201cmentally incompetent.\u201d The same trial judge who accepted the guilty pleas ordered him sent to Central State Hospital for further psychiatric examination. Two months later, Central State filed a report with the court stating that petitioner was \u201cborderline\u201d competent, suffering from mental retardation and would \u201cneed special assistance from his attorney.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">On September 19, 1975, when petitioner next appeared before the court, he attempted to withdraw his guilty pleas. The court recessed, deliberated, and five days later reconvened to deny the motion and to ent\u00e9r judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-7\">Other than the finding of incompetency made on May 22, 1975, the court made no explicit ruling on competency. The trial court did not conduct a hearing specifically on whether petitioner was competent to stand trial <em>at the time he pleaded guilty to the charges of the indictments. </em>The trial judge on initially accepting the guilty plea, asked primarily a litany of yes or no questions. When asked if anyone was putting pressure on him to force him to plead guilty, petitioner replied \u201cWell, I don\u2019t know. . . . Me [sic] have just got a wife and baby I want to come back to.\u201d Based on remarks by the prosecutor, petitioner believed, justifiably, that his wife would be prosecuted if he did not enter into the plea bargain agreement. Petitioner\u2019s ability fully to understand the gravity of his and his wife\u2019s legal situation, therefore, was of utmost importance.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-10\">The District Court held, applying the due process clause, that at some point \u2014 either when it accepted the guilty plea or before it imposed judgment four months later \u2014 the court should have conducted a hearing regarding petitioner\u2019s competency to plead guilty on March 19, 1975. <em>See Pate v. Robinson, </em>383 U.S. 375, 86 S.Ct. 836, 15 L.Ed.2d 815 (1966); <em>Dusky v. United States, </em>362 U.S. 402, 80 S.Ct. 788, 4 L.Ed.2d 824 (1960) (per curiam). The District Judge reasoned that the initial psychiatric evaluation and the trial judge\u2019s finding that petitioner was incompetent on May 22, 1975, gave the trial court the \u201cresponsibility to delve further to determine the defendant\u2019s comprehension.\u201d He concluded that it was \u201cimpossible . . . to ascertain from the record whether or not petitioner was capable of entering a guilty plea.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b534-11\">The District Court further held that, four years later, it is now too late to determine retroactively petitioner\u2019s competence on March 19, 1975, and that the state must start prosecution anew.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-12\">We agree with the District Judge\u2019s clear, well-reasoned opinion and commend his diligence in getting to the bottom of a difficult case. Petitioner\u2019s conduct, the state trial judge\u2019s finding of incompetence on May 22, 1975, and the psychiatric reports, were sufficient to cast real doubt on whether petitioner was competent on March 19, 1975, the date on which the pleas were entered. Before he entered judgment, due process in such a case required the trial judge to have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>conducted a hearing on whether petitioner was competent when he pleaded guilty, or alternatively to have allowed petitioner to withdraw his pleas.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">The only evidence that petitioner was competent when he entered his guilty pleas is the first psychiatric evaluation. This report was incomplete. It did not detail the effects of petitioner\u2019s mental illness and the psychotropic drugs on his ability to aid in his defense. In addition the report characterized petitioner\u2019s competence as \u201cmarginal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">The State argues the relevancy of a subsequent psychiatric report that declared petitioner to be competent. These examinations occurred several months after the pleas and after the judicial declaration of incompetence. They did not report on his competence on March 19, 1975, and one said that several months later the examination disclosed a \u201cborderline\u201d mental situation. That report also lends support to the need for a due process hearing on competency.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-7\">Accordingly, the judgment of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
