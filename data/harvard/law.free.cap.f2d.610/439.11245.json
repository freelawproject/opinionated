The Public Service Commission of Kentucky has petitioned the Court to review orders of the federal commission asserting such regulatory authority. We conclude that the orders of the federal commission constitute a valid exercise of jurisdiction over the transportation of natural gas in interstate commerce.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-10\">Natural gas commonly flows to consumers from the wells of producers through a series of three pipelines. The gas in its crude form first flows through a network of gathering lines that converge at compressor stations. At the compressor stations the gas undergoes cooling, scrubbing, dehydration and compression. The cleansed and pressurized gas next flows through high pressure transmission lines to local distributors. The local distributors deliver natural gas to its ultimate consumers through a third set of lines.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b513-11\">It is at the initial, gathering-line, stage that the state and federal regulatory agencies involved in this case have staked competing claims to exclusive jurisdiction. The Kentucky commission claims jurisdiction under section 278.485 of the Kentucky Revised Statutes (Baldwin 1977). Section 278.485 provides that owners of property located within one-half mile of a wellhead or gathering pipeline can demand natural gas service, subject only to terms prescribed by the Public Service Commission of Kentucky. Section 1(b) of the Natural Gas Act of 1938,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> upon which the federal commission bases its claim, requires federal regulation of the \u201ctransportation\u201d and \u201csale for resale\u201d of natural gas \u201cin interstate commerce\u201d but precludes federal jurisdiction over the \u201cproduction and gathering\u201d or the retail sale of natural gas. Section 7(c) requires a pipeline company to obtain a certificate of public convenience and necessity before engaging in such regulated activity.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Pursuant to the \u201ctransportation\u201d clause of section 1(b), the federal commission has declared that Kentucky West Virginia Gas Company, an interstate pipeline company which owns and operates approximately 2500 natural gas wells in Kentucky, first must obtain a certificate of public convenience and necessity before furnishing natural gas to local customers under Kentucky law.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-14\">It is the position of the Kentucky commission that the federal commission has no statutory authority to regulate section 278.-485 deliveries of natural gas. The Kentucky commission argues that natural gas, in the gathering line stage, has not yet entered the stream of interstate commerce within the meaning of section 1(b) of the Natural Gas Act. According to the Kentucky commission, the transportation of natural gas during the gathering line process is intrastate transportation. Moreover, the Kentucky commission contends, the gathering line movement of natural gas is part of the exempt \u201cproduction and gathering\u201d process.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-15\">The competing federal and state claims in this case result from the recent extraordi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>nary shortage of natural gas.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Equitable Gas Company, the corporate parent of Kentucky West Virginia, depends on Kentucky West Virginia and several other interstate pipeline companies to supply natural gas to it for resale in Pennsylvania and West Virginia. When Equitable began to experience curtailments from its other major suppliers in the early 1970s, it called upon Kentucky West Virginia to fill the deficit. Kentucky West Virginia, which had complied with the local preference provision of Kentucky law since 1956, thereupon announced that it no longer would provide gas to new customers pursuant to the Kentucky statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-4\">The Kentucky commission ordered Kentucky West Virginia to continue to observe the requirements of the state law. In addition the agency imposed a fine on Kentucky West Virginia for its previous refusals to comply.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The Circuit Court of Franklin County, Kentucky affirmed the order and upheld imposition of the monetary penalty.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">The company then filed the administrative proceeding before the federal commission. The federal commission on January 27, 1977 issued a declaratory order holding that transportation through gathering lines and sales to local residents by Kentucky West Virginia under section 278.485 are subject to federal jurisdiction.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The Kentucky commission unsuccessfully sought a rehearing. In denying the rehearing, though, the federal commission said that federal natural gas jurisdiction covers only sales made from the interstate transmission portion of the Kentucky West Virginia system.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b514-15\">Kentucky West Virginia filed a motion for clarification. The federal commission ruled in response that <em>all </em>of the company\u2019s sales of gas transported in such gathering lines were subject solely to federal regulation.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The state sought a rehearing of the clarifying order.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Pursuant to \u00a7 19(b) of the Natural Gas Act, the Kentucky commission then petitioned this Court to review the validity of the federal orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-16\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-17\">The Natural Gas Act was the product of a congressional desire to assure an adequate, reliable and reasonably-priced supply of natural gas for the entire nation.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Congress sought to achieve this objective by creating a comprehensive regulatory framework<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> through which, among <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>other things, the movement of natural gas through the interstate pipelines could be coordinated. In borderline cases involving the respective ambits of state and federal regulatory authority, therefore, courts ask whether it is within the capability of states to regulate in accordance with the purposes of the Natural Gas Act.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> If practicable regulation exceeds the competence of the state governments, courts can preserve the efficacy of the Natural Gas Act only by determining that federal authority prevails.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">The inability of the states to regulate effectively the nationwide allocation of natural gas supplies, as attempted in part by Kentucky here, is apparent. The Kentucky law seeks to reserve a supply of natural gas to certain state resid\u00e9nts. The statutory plan, independent of federal regulatory control, denies to consumers outside of Kentucky and to Kentuckians whose real estate lies beyond one-half mile of wellheads and gathering lines the equal access that they otherwise would enjoy to Kentucky natural gas. If pursued by many or all producing states in times of extraordinary scarcity, the Kentucky policy would impede, if not prohibit altogether, accomplishment of the congressional desire to provide an adequate supply of natural gas for the entire nation.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-9\">The need for paramount federal authority here is compelling. As the Supreme Court noted in <em>FPC v. Louisiana Power &amp; Light Co., </em>the \u201cstate agency would be obliged to regulate in the State, not the national interest.\u201d <footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Indeed, the \u201cunavoidable conflict between producing States and consuming States\u201d makes \u201cthe desirability of uniform federal regulation . abundantly clear.\u201d <footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b515-10\">Federal authority to regulate the allocation of natural gas supplies derives from the \u201ctransportation\u201d clause of section 1(b) of the Natural Gas Act. The Supreme Court emphasized in <em>Louisiana Power, supra, </em>that, where allocation of acutely scarce natural gas supplies is at issue, the interstate transportation jurisdiction of the federal government must be construed broadly.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> In <em>Louisiana Power </em>the Court upheld federal allocation and curtailment regulations under the auspices of the transportation clause. The Court thereby sought to ensure that the federal government could allocate natural gas fairly among users.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b515-11\">We are unwilling in the present case to give a more narrow meaning to the transportation clause. As the Supreme Court stated in <em>Louisiana Power, </em>the trans<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>portation clause \u201cplainly embraces regulation of the quantities of gas that pipelines may transport.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The states thus may not, without federal authorization, divert from the interstate market supplies of natural gas for the use of state residents only.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-4\">The Kentucky statute, according to the PSCK, regards the gathering line natural gas as a distinctly intrastate commodity.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The unprocessed hydrocarbons, of course, are not precisely the same product that reaches Pennsylvania and West Virginia consumers through the high pressure transmission lines of Kentucky West Virginia Gas Company. Yet the difference in the nature of the gas is not significant in determining the applicability of federal regulation. The ultimate sale in other states of a substantial part of a producer\u2019s natural gas output invokes federal jurisdiction over the entire volume of production.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> The natural gas here at issue begins its journey in interstate commerce at the wellhead.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-10\">Nor do we find merit in the contention that the \u201cproduction and gathering\u201d clause gives the PSCK exclusive jurisdiction over section 278.485 distributions. The production and gathering exemption, as authoritatively construed by the Supreme Court, pertains only to the operation of properties involved in the extraction and collection of natural gas.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> States have no power under the proviso to control allocation of natural gas. To adopt the spacious conception of the production and gathering clause proposed by PSCK, we would have to repudiate a clear and compelling line of decisions to the contrary.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b516-11\">We believe, therefore, that the Natural Gas Act assigns to the FERC exclusive regulatory responsibility for transportation of Kentucky West Virginia natural gas from wellheads through gathering lines. That responsibility includes the power to prohibit deliveries of natural gas for which no certificate of public convenience and necessity has been issued.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>Accordingly, the orders of the FERC are affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b513-12\">. <em>See generally Calvert v.
