ROBINSON, III, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b987-17\">Petitioners, Papago Tribal Utility Authority (PTUA) and Arizona Electric Power Cooperative, Inc. (AEPCO), and the interve-nor, Electrical District No. One (ED-1), challenge the Federal Power Commission\u2019s<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> acceptance of a rate-increase filing by Arizona Public Service Company (APS) purportedly pursuant to Section 205(d) of the Federal Power Act.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Both petitioners contend that this endeavor to achieve higher rates suffered from a fatal lack of supporting data. Additionally, PTUA and ED-1 assert that under the familiar <em>Mobile-Sierra </em>doctrine<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> their preexisting service agreements \u00edfrith APS prohibit implementation of the new rates until the Commission affirmatively adjudges their validity. We find merit in the second claim,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> though none in the first,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and order rectification accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-18\">I. THE ADMINISTRATIVE BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b987-19\">In early 1976, APS, a public electric utility subject to the Federal Power Act,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> tendered for filing increases in its rates to seventeen wholesale customers, including those who are litigants here. Early on, petitioners sought and were granted leave to intervene. Both opposed the filing for alleged failure to meet the Commission\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"916\">*916</page-number>requirements respecting accompanying documentary justification.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> PTUA further insisted that its contract with APS<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> barred any rate elevation not properly resulting from a proceeding under Section 206(a) of the Act.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b988-4\">The Commission was unmoved by either argument. With respect to petitioners and ED-1 as well, the Commission in the first of the two orders under review, accepted APS\u2019s filing, suspended the new rates for one month with leave thereafter to go into effect subject to refund, and established hearing procedures.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The Commission read the APS-PTUA contract as reserving to APS the right to make unilateral rate-raising filings.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The Commission also deemed APS\u2019s filing to be in compliance with pertinent regulations and adequate for purposes of its suspension determination.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b988-5\">Subsequently, PTUA and AEPCO sought rehearing, again urging their previous positions. ED-1 applied for intervention and rehearing, maintaining that its rates could be altered only after a Section 206(a) investigation. The Commission permitted ED-1 to intervene but denied the requests of these three parties for rehearing.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> A timely petition for review in this court followed.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b988-15\">II. THE LEGALITY OF THE FILING The Commission\u2019s regulations establish fairly stringent informational requirements for electric utilities undertaking to amend their rate schedules.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> On the ground that these demands went unmet, petitioners urged the Commission to reject APS\u2019s filing. That the Commission twice refused to do,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> and petitioners reassert their position here.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b988-16\">With the rate-raising tariff in issue, APS transmitted four volumes of supporting materials to the Commission. Included were sales and revenue comparisons, historic and projected cost-of-service studies, workpa-pers related to the estimates of future costs and prepared direct testimony of APS witnesses. Despite the copiousness of the submission, petitioners sought considerably more. Petitioners say that the supplied information did not fully explain various indi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"917\">*917</page-number>vidual statements deemed essential components of the filing utility\u2019s presentation by the regulations,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> or the derivation or bases of the figures estimated for the future test year. The gravamen of petitioner\u2019s complaint is captured in their assertion that APS\u2019s workpapers \u201cdo nothing more than show the constituent elements of the summary figures and provide such breakdowns in equally summary form. Thus, we have no means of knowing what assumptions, facts, and methods were used to calculate each of the numbers shown either in such statements or in the related workpapers.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Assuming without deciding that petitioners might in some circumstances claim benefit from the Commission\u2019s informational regulations,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> we think they misconceive the true function of those regulations and in consequence have built their argument on a foundation of sand.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-9\">Section 205(d) of the Federal Power Act requires a utility to give at least 30 days\u2019 notice prior to implementation of a rate alteration, unless otherwise ordered by the Commission.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Upon receipt of such notice, the Commission, by virtue of Section 205(e), may suspend the operation of the new rate for a maximum of five months and direct a hearing on its lawfulness.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> So, responsively to the dictates of the Act, the Commission must be prepared to review each rate-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"918\">*918</page-number>change filing within the 30-day period, for only then is it in position to \u201cevaluate in each case the advisability of suspending the rate [of] filing pending full hearings on the reasonableness of the proposed rates.\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AdN\">It was to facilitate the Commission\u2019s task in this regard that the Commission promulgated in Section 35.13 of its regulations<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> a number of rules requiring utilities to augment their rate-change filings with a variety of information.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> As the Commission then explained, the purpose was \u201cto enable [it] to process rate schedule filings more expeditiously.\u201d<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> And this court has discerned a subsidiary function likewise served by these rules, deriving from the Commission\u2019s \u201cauthority to structure its filing requirements so as to afford as meaningful notice as possible to a utility\u2019s customers and to avoid the possibility of detrimental reliance upon inaccurate filing submissions.\u201d<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> We thus have recognized, as has the Commission, that the purposes of the informational regulations are</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AzTA\">to assure that the rate filing will provide the [Commission] with the necessary information from which it can reach an informed and equitable decision as to the necessity for an investigation, hearing and suspension, and to permit the Commission and parties in interest with meaningful opportunity to prepare for any proceeding.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b990-11\">Against this functional backdrop, we cannot accept petitioners\u2019 premise that Section 35.13 summons the filing of supplemental information in the quantity and detail needed to establish the validity of the new rates on the merits.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> \u201cAt the tariff filing stage, the Commission is authorized to make only a limited determination: whether the proposed tariff is \u2018sufficiently complete for it to be able to decide whether or not to investigate and suspend the increased rate\u2019 <footnotemark>30</footnotemark> \u201cit is only at the hearing stage that the Commission may inquire into the merits of the rate increase.\u201d <footnotemark>31</footnotemark> Consequently, at the point of filing, the Commission has need only for only enough data to make the \u201cfirst cut\u201d<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> and take the \u201cfirst look.\u201d<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> And while a byproduct of the information regulations is a better opportunity for preparation by protestants and the Commission alike, it is with respect to the proceeding on the merits that this assistance is contemplated. The regulations obviously are not intended to supplant the discovery, presentation of evidence and briefing attendant upon the hearing proc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"919\">*919</page-number>ess,<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> or to displace that plenary and deliberate process by a summary merits determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-4\">Nor are we impressed by petitioners\u2019 insistence that the Commission was duty bound to pass on their motion to reject APS\u2019s rate filing as unlawful, and was not free to postpone a ruling thereon until the hearing on the merits. With this, as an academic proposition, we thoroughly agree,<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> but it has no application here. In its original order, the Commission stated that \u201c[w]ith respect to the sufficiency of the filing, the Commission\u2019s filing regulations are intended to allow a first look at the rate increase,\u201d and that \u201c[wjhether APS has justified its rate increase is properly a matter for the hearing the Commission herein orders.\u201d<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> We read this to mean that the challenged filing sufficed for purposes of the \u201cfirst look,\u201d whether or not it would carry the day when the merits were reached. Any doubt as to the Commission\u2019s view on the adequacy of the filing was dispelled on rehearing when the Commission declared \u201cthat the material filed in support of the proposed rate increase complies with Section 35.13 of the Regulations,\u201d and \u201cthat the questions raised as to the merits of the rate increase are not proper for summary disposal but should properly be asserted at the hearing ordered to determine the lawfulness of the proposed rates.\u201d<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> Accordingly, we cannot accept petitioners\u2019 argument that the Commission deferred a decision on a deficient filing on the theory that it could be remedied during the hearing process.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> Rather, the Commission ruled positively on petitioners\u2019 motion to reject and denied it because, in its view, APS\u2019s filing satisfied the pertinent regulations. The Commission ordered an eventual hearing, not for purposes of curing an infirm filing, but to enable a decision on the merits of the sought-after rate hike. The Commission thus thoroughly distinguished compliance with Section 35.13 from validity of the new rate, and pretermitted only the latter to completion of a full evidentiary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-13\">As we assay the validity of the Commission\u2019s acceptance of APS\u2019s filing, we remain advertent to the constricted nature of the Commission\u2019s determination and our role on review. The Commission\u2019s regulations call for \u201crejectpon of] any material submitted for filing with the Commission which patently fails to substantially comply with the applicable requirements . . ..\u201d<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> We have recognized the Commission\u2019s authority to cast a nonconforming filing aside,<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> but have noted that rejection \u201cshould mark the clear case of a filing that patently is either deficient in form or a substantive nullity.\u201d<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> Since \u201cthe Commission\u2019s filing requirements are \u2018mere aids to the exercise of the agency\u2019s independent discretion,\u2019 and in both language and purpose leave room for a doctrine of \u2018substantial\u2019 or \u2018reasonable\u2019 com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"920\">*920</page-number>pliance,\u201d <footnotemark>42</footnotemark> \u201cCommission authority to reject the rate schedule at the filing stage is limited to those filings which are patently defective on their face.\u201d<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> And \u201c[a] reviewing court\u2019s ability to require a rejection of a rate filing is even more circumscribed, being limited to a determination of whether the agency acted arbitrarily and capriciously in accepting the filing.\u201d<footnotemark>44</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b992-4\">Applying these principles to the case at bar, we see no basis upon which we might upset the Commission\u2019s reprobation of petitioners\u2019 contention that APS\u2019s filing was manifestly inadequate. We do not believe it unreasonable for an agency on the one hand to call generally for comprehensive data and on the other to retain a sound discretion to allow particular filings that are less than fully documented. The Commission\u2019s interpretation of its own regulations is \u201cof controlling weight unless it is plainly erroneous,\u201d<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> and upon a careful review of the documentary support accompanying APS\u2019s new rate schedule we cannot characterize it as too scanty to enable the Commission to prepare for a preliminary probe into the validity of the filed rates and to make a suitably informed determination on whether to suspend and investigate them.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> In sum, on this record we are unable to say that the Commission exceeded the legitimate bounds of its discretion in holding that the informational regulations did not warrant rejection of the filing.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-12\">III. THE LEGALITY OF THE INTERIM INCREASE</p>\n<p id=\"Axz\">We now address the question whether APS\u2019s service agreements with PTUA and ED-1 prevent APS\u2019s rate increase from taking effect prior to affirmative and specific approval by the Commission.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> The relevant language of the APS-PTUA contract is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b992-13\">The rates hereinabove set out . are to remain in effect . . . until changed by the Federal Power Commission or other regulatory authority, with either party hereto to be free unilaterally to take appropriate action before the Federal Power Commission or other lawful regulatory authority in connection with changes which may be desired by such party.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b992-15\">Its counterpart in the contract between APS and ED \u2014 1 is practically the same.<footnotemark>49</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b993-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"921\">*921</page-number>A. <em>The Problem</em></p>\n<p id=\"atw-dedup-0\">PTUA and ED \u2014 1 contend that these stipulations ban unilateral utility-made rate elevations, and permit only Commission-made changes in conformity with Section 206(a) of the Act.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> The Commission, however, held that the provisions reserved to APS the prerogative of initiating new rates under Section 205.<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> The consequences of this ruling, if valid, are clear. Upon expiration of the suspension period following the Commission\u2019s acceptance of APS\u2019s filing,<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"922\">*922</page-number>higher rates went into operation without any positive action by the Commission approving them, and notwithstanding its direction of a hearing on their legality.<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> If, however, PTUA and ED-1 are correct in their position, APS is bound by the lower rates until such time as the Commission prescribes different rates.<footnotemark>54</footnotemark> The central inquiry, then, is whether the service agreements with these customers leave APS free to alter the contract rate unilaterally through the mechanism established by Section 205, or whether they merely tolerate institution of a Section 206(a) proceeding which will lead to Commission orders disposing of the matters one way or the other.<footnotemark>55</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b994-4\">In neither of its two decisions did the Commission deem it necessary to devote more than brief discussion to this issue. In its order allowing APS\u2019s filing as to PTUA, the Commission disposed of the latter\u2019s arguments as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b994-5\">PTUA states that [the contractual] language contemplates changes made only by the Commission, and thus, pursuant to Section 206 of the Federal Power Act. PTUA states that the reservation of the right reserved in the second part of the quoted language<footnotemark>56</footnotemark> is the right of APS to request a Section 206 investigation of APS\u2019 rates. APS\u2019 rights are restricted by the specific statement that (only) the Commission may change the rates. The Commission believes such a construction strains the meaning of the language. APS clearly reserved the right to make rate increase filings which are \u201cappropriate action\u201d for a utility to make to effectuate \u201cchanges which may be desired by such party.\u201d<footnotemark>57</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b994-14\">And in its order denying rehearing, the Commission merely said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b994-15\">PTUA argues that * * * the reservation of the right to take appropriate action refers to APS\u2019 right to request a Section 206 investigation of its rates . . This interpretation would make the reservation meaningless. The Commission believes that, while the provision is not artfully drafted, it does contemplate the unilateral filing of a notice of change in rates under Section 205 of the Act.<footnotemark>58</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b994-16\">Since the companion provision in the contract between APS and ED-1 did not differ, the Commission gave it the same treatment.<footnotemark>59</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b994-17\">The obvious starting point for resolution of the issue is close textual analysis of the parties\u2019 common agreement. The rates contractually specified, it says, \u201care to remain in effect . . . until changed by the Federal Power Commission,\u201d <footnotemark>60</footnotemark> thus making plain enough that the sole mechanism the parties supplied for modifying contract rates is a \u201cchange[ ] by the . . . Commission,\u201d and that until it is utilized those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"923\">*923</page-number>rates \u201care to remain in effect.\u201d<footnotemark>61</footnotemark> The agreement, to be sure, expressly leaves \u201ceither party . . . free unilaterally to take appropriate action before the . Commission ... in connection with changes that may be desired by such party,\u201d <footnotemark>62</footnotemark> but the narrowly limited nature of this provision is manifest. Since the rates may be \u201cchanged\u201d only \u201cby the Commission,\u201d unilateralism is to be indulged, not for party-alteration of the rates, but only for steps by a party which may be calculated to induce Commission-alteration. This dispensation in no wise undertakes to impinge upon the earlier language making clear that only through a \u201cchange[ ] by the Commission\u201d can the existing rates be superseded by new rates. The crucial inquiry, then, is the meaning properly to be ascribed to the word \u201cchange[].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b995-5\">B. <em>The Statutory Scheme</em></p>\n<p id=\"a1l-dedup-0\">The critical difference between private and public promulgation of electric-power rates in the federal domain becomes apparent upon careful examination of the regulatory scheme erected by Sections 205 and 206 of the Federal Power Act. Under Section 205(c), public electric utilities must file with the Commission all rates and contracts affecting rates for transmissions and sales subject to its jurisdiction.<footnotemark>63</footnotemark> Unless otherwise ordered by the Commission, changes in preexisting rates must remain on file at least 30 days before taking effect.<footnotemark>64</footnotemark> The Commission may embark upon a hearing on the validity of the rate, in which event it will subsequently enter an order concerning it.<footnotemark>65</footnotemark> The Commission is also authorized to suspend the rate for a maximum five-month period beyond the time it otherwise would have become effective.<footnotemark>66</footnotemark> The rate goes into operation if the suspension period expires before the rate investigation is completed,<footnotemark>67</footnotemark> but in that event the Commission may direct the utility to keep account of all amounts received by reason of any increase in the rate, and to refund such portion of the increase as may ultimately be found excessive.<footnotemark>68</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b995-14\">The Act also, in Section 206(a), enables the Commission to substitute its own rate for an unlawful party-initiated rate.<footnotemark>69</footnotemark> The condition precedent to exercise of this power is a finding that the existing rate \u201cis unjust, unreasonable, unduly discriminatory or preferential.\u201d<footnotemark>70</footnotemark> Once satisfied, however, the Commission must \u201cdetermine the just and reasonable rate . . . to be thereafter observed and in force, and . fix the same by order.\u201d <footnotemark>71</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b995-16\">These provisions \u201care in all material respects substantially identical to the equivalent provisions of the Natural Gas Act,\u201d<footnotemark>72</footnotemark> which the Supreme Court has subjected to extended analysis.<footnotemark>73</footnotemark> By analogy to the Court\u2019s reading of those provisions, the essential characteristics of Sections 205 and 206(a) may easily be discerned. The Act, the Court said, \u201cevinces no purpose to abrogate private rate contracts as such. To the contrary, by requiring contracts to be filed with the Commission, the Act expressly recognizes that rates to particular customers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"924\">*924</page-number>may be set by individual contracts\u201d.<footnotemark>74</footnotemark> But while the Act \u201cpermits the relations between the parties to be established initially by contract, the protection of the public interest [is] afforded by supervision of the individual contracts, which to that end must be filed with the Commission and made public.\u201d<footnotemark>75</footnotemark> Sections 205 and 206(a)</p>\n<blockquote id=\"a8n-dedup-0\">are simply parts of a single statutory scheme under which all rates are established initially by the [utilities], by contract or otherwise, and all rates are subject to being modified by the Commission upon a finding that they are unlawful. The Act merely defines the review powers of the Commission and imposes such duties on [utilities] as are necessary to effectuate those powers; it purports neither to grant nor to define the initial rate-setting powers of [electric utilities].<footnotemark>76</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b996-4\">Correspondingly, Section 206(a) is neither a \u201crate-making\u201d nor a \u201crate-changing\u201d procedure. It is simply the power to review rates and contracts made in the first instance by [electric utilities] and, if they are determined to be unlawful, to remedy them. Section [206(a)] would of its own force apply to <em>all </em>the rates of a [utility], whether long-established or newly changed, but in the latter case the power is further implemented by \u00a7 [205(e)], All that \u00a7 [205(e)] does, however, is to add to this basic power, in the case of a newly changed rate or contract . , the further powers (1) to preserve the status quo pending review of the new rate by suspending its operation for a limited period, and (2) thereafter make its order retroactive, by means of the refund provision, to the date the change became effective. The scope and purpose of the Commission\u2019s review remains the same \u2014 to determine whether the rate fixed by the [utility] is lawful.<footnotemark>77</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b996-12\">From this, the fundamental distinction between party-ratemaking and Commission-ratemaking under the Act clearly emerges. Section 205(d) \u201cprovides not for the filing of \u2018proposals\u2019 but for notice to the Commission of any \u2018change * * * made by\u2019 [the filing utility,] . . 1 and the change is effected, if at all, not by an order of the Commission but solely by virtue of the [utility\u2019s] own action.\u201d<footnotemark>78</footnotemark> On the other hand, \u201c[t]he Commission has undoubted power under \u00a7 206(a) to prescribe a change in contract rates whenever it determines such rates to be unlawful.\u201d<footnotemark>79</footnotemark> The vital difference, however, is that the Section 206(a) \u201cpower is limited to prescribing the rate \u2018to be thereafter observed\u2019 and thus can effect no change prior to the date of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"925\">*925</page-number>the order\u201d;<footnotemark>80</footnotemark> \u201cthe Commission\u2019s order . if based on the necessary findings, [can only be] effective to prescribe the proposed rate as the rate to be in effect prospectively from the date of the order . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>81</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b997-4\">C. <em>Administrative Interpretations</em></p>\n<p id=\"Aub\">The force of <em>Mobile-Sierra\u2019s </em>refinement of the statutory scheme in this context has not been completely lost on the Commission. In a series of decisions, both before and after those in the case at bar, the Commission has recognized the crucial distinction between utility and agency promulgation of rates, and has accorded due respect to contrasts envisioning rate-change only at the hand of the Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-5\">In <em>Indiana &amp; Michigan Electric </em>Co.,<footnotemark>82</footnotemark> the Commission examined an electric-service agreement specifying that \u201c[s]hould any change in the [contract] rate <em>... be ordered </em>by\u201d the regulating agency, payment for the service \u201cshall thereafter be made upon the basis of such new rate <em>as changed and approved </em>by the\u201d agency.<footnotemark>83</footnotemark> Viewing Section 205 as a provision, not for the filing of \u201cproposals,\u201d but for notice to the Commission of a change \u201ceffected . solely\u201d by the utility,<footnotemark>84</footnotemark> the Commission decided that \u201can order by this Commission accepting for filing a rate increase pursuant to Section 205 is not approval of such an increase by this Commission,\u201d<footnotemark>85</footnotemark> and that the increase was obtainable only under Section 206(a).<footnotemark>86</footnotemark> Likewise, in <em>Detroit Edison </em>Co.<footnotemark>87</footnotemark> the Commission addressed an agreement providing that the contract \u201crates are subject to change by <em>order </em>issued by the Commission.\u201d <footnotemark>88</footnotemark> In holding that the utilization of Section 205 was foreclosed, the Commission explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b997-13\">Since the parties provided for changes in rates only by order issued by the Commission, it is clear that they did not contemplate the unilateral filings permitted by Section 205. The only changes in rates which occur by order of the Commission occur pursuant to an order issued pursuant to Section 206. Thus, the parties have provided that changes in rates will only occur pursuant to Section 206.<footnotemark>89</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b997-14\">Even more similar to the instant case is <em>Appalachian Power Co.,</em><footnotemark><em>90</em></footnotemark><em> </em>where a fixed-rate contract provided that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"aue-dedup-0\">any party may at any time or from time to time, unilaterally take any action before or with such authorities [having jurisdiction] with respect to any term, or conditions of this Agreement that it deems desirable and in such event the terms and conditions under which service shall be rendered hereunder shall be the terms and conditions authorized by such authority.<footnotemark>91</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b997-15\">Stating that phrases such as \u201cordered,\u201d \u201capproved,\u201d \u201cauthorized\u201d and \u201cprescribed\u201d by the Commission \u201cdo not permit unilateral filing under Section 205 of the Federal Power Act,\u201d<footnotemark>92</footnotemark> the Commission, in a first opinion, concluded that the language respecting the \u201cauthorized\u201d action was intended to qualify and limit the preceding language concerning \u201cunilateral action\u201d and thus sanction a Section 206(a) but not a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"926\">*926</page-number>Section 205 procedure for effecting rate changes.<footnotemark>93</footnotemark> On rehearing, the Commission adhered firmly to that view.<footnotemark>94</footnotemark> The Section 206(a) route was clearly contemplated, the Commission said, by the contractual stipulation that \u201cthe terms and conditions under which service shall be rendered hereunder shall be the terms and conditions <em>authorized by such </em>authority.\u201d<footnotemark>95</footnotemark> The Commission rejected the utility\u2019s</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b998-4\">argument that the word \u201cauthorized\u201d is somehow different from such words as \u201cordered\u201d, \u201capproved\u201d, or \u201cprescribed\u201d, which have figured in past decisions holding that a contract contemplated a 206 rather than a 205 procedure, It is not the use of a particular word on which <em>Mobile-Sierra </em>determinations turn but on the way words are used to express the intention of the parties to a contract. Similarly, there is no merit to APCO\u2019s argument that the use of the word \u201cauthorized\u201d in Section 5 by itself indicates that the parties meant merely the \u201cauthorization\u201d of a suspension and effective date of a filing under Section 205. Such suspension and effective date are \u201cauthorized\u201d by means of a Commission order, so APCO\u2019s argument would apply equally had the words \u201cordered\u201d, \u201capproved\u201d or \u201cprescribed\u201d been used. The Commission\u2019s decision must be based on more than semantics.<footnotemark>96</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b998-13\">And the provision empowering \u201cany party\u201d to \u201ctake any action before or with\u201d the regulatory body \u201cwith respect to any terms, or conditions of [the] [a]greement that it deems desirable\u201d did not, the Commission held, make for a different result.<footnotemark>97</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b998-14\">D. <em>The Contractual Language</em></p>\n<p id=\"ayn-dedup-0\">Scrutinizing the pertinent language of the involved service agreements in light of <em>Mobile-Sierra </em>and its adjudicative applications, we find ourselves unable to subscribe to the Commission\u2019s holding that they authorized APS to raise rates merely by securing administrative acceptance of a purported Section 205(d) filing. Our difficulties with the Commission\u2019s outcome are several, each stemming from an independent quarter.</p>\n<p id=\"b998-15\">The linchpin of the Commission\u2019s position is the second clause of the provision governing rate changes, which in the Commission\u2019s view \u201cclearly reserved the right to make <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"927\">*927</page-number>rate increase filings which are \u2018appropriate action[s]\u2019 for a utility to make <em>to effectuate </em>\u2018changes which may be desired by such party.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>98</footnotemark> We are inclined to believe that the error to which the Commission succumbed had its genesis in this rather obviously over-broad reading of that clause. What it actually says is that \u201ceither party hereto [shall] be free unilaterally <em>to take appropriate action </em>before the Federal Power Commission . in connection with changes which may be desired by such party.\u201d<footnotemark>99</footnotemark> Surely there is nothing in this language expressly sanctioning action <em>\u201cto effectuate </em>\u201d a rate change. Rather, it plainly states that the parties are free, not to \u201ceffectuate\u201d anything, but simply \u201cto take appropriate action before the . . . Commission.\u201d This connotes merely procedural steps and advocacy before the Commission, not self-effectuation of new rates lacking the express imprimatur of the Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-5\">The Commission coupled its unduly expansive reading of the second clause with an unnaturally constrained reading of the first. The opening clause issues a clarion command that the contract rates \u201cremain in effect . . . until changed by the . Commission\u201d <footnotemark>100</footnotemark> \u2014 an edict, as we have seen, for revision of rates, if at all, only by adjudication on the part of the Commission.<footnotemark>101</footnotemark> In neither of its two opinions did the Commission give the first clause more than fleeting notice. In its initial decision, the Commission disposed of it with the observation that PTUA\u2019s reading \u201cstrains its language because, by the Commission\u2019s lights, the second clause \u201creserved the right to make rate increase filings which are \u2018appropriate action\u2019 for a utility to make to effectuate \u2018changes which may be desired by such party.\u2019 \u201d <footnotemark>102</footnotemark> In its decision on rehearing, the Commission was content to say merely that PTUA\u2019s interpretation of the first clause \u201cwould make the reservation meaningless\u201d <footnotemark>103</footnotemark> \u2014 presumably because the right to litigate for a Commission-made rate change would exist without the reservation. This theory seems flatly contrary to the Commission\u2019s conclusion in <em>Appalachian Power Co.,</em><footnotemark><em>104</em></footnotemark><em> </em>where a similar reservation was not permitted to override the contracts\u2019 call for \u201cauthoriz[ation]\u201d of rate changes by the appropriate regulatory body.<footnotemark>105</footnotemark> Moreover, preserving the parties\u2019 liberty \u201cto take appropriate action before the . . . Commission ... in connection with [desired rate] changes\u201d strikes us as a perfectly normal method of complementing clause one\u2019s insistence upon agency changes by underscoring that only by Commission action \u2014 perhaps at a party\u2019s urging \u2014 and not simply by a Section 205(d) filing, could the contract rates be altered.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-17\">There is yet another important consideration. The second clause of the paragraph under examination leaves <em>\u201ceither </em>party\u201d thereto, not just APS, \u201cfree unilaterally to take appropriate action ... in con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"928\">*928</page-number>nection with changes which\u201d it wishes<footnotemark>106</footnotemark> \u2014language that can refer only to action under the Act open to <em>both </em>parties. There is no way that a consumer can trigger the rate-changing mechanism of Section 205.<footnotemark>107</footnotemark> Section 206, however, expressly recognizes the right of any person, including jurisdictional customers, to file a complaint seeking initiation of a proceeding thereunder.<footnotemark>108</footnotemark> Of course, it is also clear that a public electric utility can present information to the Commission justifying a Section 206(a) investigation and couple with it a request for relief in the form of an agency-ordered rate increase.<footnotemark>109</footnotemark> This construction of the second clause harmonizes it with the first, for only pursuant to Section 206(a) can the Commission \u201cchange\u201d party-made rates.<footnotemark>110</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1000-4\">To recapitulate, the Commission\u2019s construction of the rate-change paragraph of the service agreements is unacceptable for several reasons. The first clause unambiguously binds the parties to the contract rates save as \u201cchanged\u201d by the Commission. Rate alterations pursuant to Section 205 are not Commission-promulgated, but rather are utility-made; the only way the Commission can \u201cchange\u201d rates is through a Section 206(a) proceeding. This much is settled law,<footnotemark>111</footnotemark> and thus far Section 206(a) affords the exclusive avenue to rate relief.<footnotemark>112</footnotemark> The language of the second clause, which read naturally simply preserves the right of either party to petition the Commission for relief pursuant to Section 206(a), cannot fairly be distended into an expression of intent to override the clear specification of the first. This interpretation of the two provisions leaves each with its own sphere of operation and assures their consonance. It is our considered view, then, that the APS-PTUA and APS-ED \u2014 1 agreements contemplate not utility-fashioned rate-changes pursuant to Section 205 but only Commission-promulgated rate revisions under Section 206(a). It follows that APS\u2019s unilateral Section 205(d) rate-change filings could not validly succeed in their purpose,<footnotemark>113</footnotemark> and that the contract rates remain effective until such time as they are appropriately changed by the Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-14\">E. <em>Canons of Construction</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1000-15\">For the reasons we have articulated, we believe the parties\u2019 covenant on rate changes clearly bars unilateral increases of the contract rates. Even if the crucial language can be viewed as susceptible to a hint of ambiguity, well-established principles of contract interpretation shore up its plain meaning. Several considerations are relevant in this connection, and as one they point undeviatingly in that direction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-16\">To begin with, it would have been extremely simple for the drafter of the provision in question to make crystal clear the utility\u2019s privilege to unilaterally increase the contract rates by resort to Section 205 had the parties really contemplated that.<footnotemark>114</footnotemark> That they did not is strongly suggested by the ineptness of the contractual language for embodiment of a prerogative toward that end.<footnotemark>115</footnotemark> APS hardly lacked the know-how, for its service agreement with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"929\">*929</page-number>AEPCO, a joint petitioner herein,<footnotemark>116</footnotemark> unmistakably confers upon APS the right to begin collecting an increased rate simply upon its acceptance by the Commission for filing.<footnotemark>117</footnotemark> We feel that the plain and vital language differences between the APS-AEPCO contracts and those involved here simply cannot be overlooked.</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-4\">Relatedly, the record discloses that the APS-PTUA-type rate-change provision was drafted by APS,<footnotemark>118</footnotemark> and it has long been the rule that \u201clanguage is construed most strongly against him that uses it.\u201d <footnotemark>119</footnotemark> APS, a major electric utility, is fairly chargeable with the ability to state what it means. It does not lie in its mouth to deny the natural import of its stipulation on rate revisions, which withdraws from APS the right to unilaterally effectuate rate changes pursuant to Section 205.</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-5\">Even more importantly, to yield to the Commission\u2019s interpretation of that stipulation is to dishonor the principle that apparently conflicting contractual provisions are to be construed with a view toward reconciliation.<footnotemark>120</footnotemark> The second clause leaves \u201ceither party . . . free unilaterally,\u201d not to change or accomplish a change of rates <em>ex mero motu, </em>but only \u201cto take appropriate action before the . Commission ... in connection\u201d therewith.<footnotemark>121</footnotemark> If this is taken as a grant of authority to effectively alter rates merely through a Section 205(d) filing \u2014 the vehicle for party-made but not Commission-made rates<footnotemark>122</footnotemark> \u2014 it cannot be squared with the first clause, which states explicitly that the contract rates are to govern \u201cuntil changed by the . . . Commission.\u201d<footnotemark>123</footnotemark> The construction to which we subscribe sacrifices neither clause on the altar of the other, but assures, we think, their functioning both maximally and concordantly.</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-15\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-16\">As we have had occasion to observe, the <em>Mobile-Sierra </em>doctrine \u201cis refreshingly simple: The contract between the parties governs the legality of the filing. Rate filings consistent with contractual obligations are valid; rate filings inconsistent with contractual obligations are invalid.\u201d <footnotemark>124</footnotemark> So, \u201cin deciding whether to accept a filing of a rate increase made unilaterally by the seller the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"930\">*930</page-number>Commission must decide whether the parties intended to allow such unilateral changes or whether the contract established a fixed rate that can be changed only through mutual negotiation.\u201d <footnotemark>125</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1002-4\">In the litigation under review, the Commission concluded that APS\u2019s service agreements permitted it to elevate the contract rates by the simple expedient of a filing under Section 205(d). We hold that the agreements, properly construed, authorize rate revisions only by an appropriate order of the Commission in a Section 206(a) proceeding.<footnotemark>126</footnotemark> It follows that APS\u2019s filings were ineffective for purposes of immediate effectuation of the new rates.<footnotemark>127</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1002-5\">The orders under review are affirmed as to AEPCO and reversed as to PTUA and ED \u2014 1, and the case is remanded to the Commission for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b987-13\">.

The Court further explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b996-10\">If the purported change is one [the utility] has the power to make, the \u201cchange\u201d is completed upon compliance with the notice requirement and the new rate has the same force as any other rate \u2014 it can be set aside only upon being found unlawful by the Commission. It is thus no more a \u201cproposed\u201d rate than any other rate, all of which are equally subject to Commission review. Likewise, no \u201cproceeding\u201d is \u201cinitiated\u201d by a \u00a7 [205(d)] filing. A proceeding to review the new rate may be initiated under \u00a7 [205(e)], but, if so, it is initiated by the Commission in the same manner as a proceeding under \u00a7 [206(a)] to review any other rate, that is, upon complaint or its own motion. The only difference is the interim suspension period given by \u00a7 [205(e)], but that in no way affects the character of the proceeding, which remains, like a \u00a7 [206(a)] proceeding, simply a review by the Commission of a rate established by the [utility]. In short, the Act provides no \u201cprocedure\u201d either for making or changing rates; it provides only for <em>notice </em>to the Commission of the rates established by [electric utilities] and for <em>review </em>by the Commission of those rates. The initial rate-making and rate-changing powers of [electric utilities] remain undefined and unaffected by the Act.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b996-16\"><em>United Gas Pipe Pine Co. v. Mobile Gas Serv.

This provision, incorporated into a 1972 contract modifying a 1957 interconnection agreement which, by the Commission\u2019s construction, was a fixed-rate contract yielding no indication as to when or how the rate could be changed, <em>id. </em>at 2-3, was \u201carguably ambiguous,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 3, and summoned enlightenment from a comparison of the rights and liabilities of the parties before and after the agreed-upon modification. <em>Id. </em>at 3\u20144, citing Sam <em>Rayburn Dam Elec. Coop. v. FPC, </em>169 U.S.App.D.C. 281, 515 F.2d 998 (1975). So, said the Commission,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b998-11\">viewed in this light, the language of Section 5 providing for unilateral action before regulatory authorities does have a purpose consistent with an intention to establish Section 206 procedures for rate changes. Previously, under the fixed rate contract, no unilateral action was contractually permissible; after Section 5, any party could institute a proceeding under Section 206 by unilaterally taking \u201cany action before or with such authorities with respect to any term or conditions of the Agreement that it deems desirable\u201d without assuming the heavy Sierra burden.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b998-17\">In looking at the \u201cauthorized by such authority\u201d wording, on the other hand, we find no answer which would show such language to be equally consistent with an intent to establish a Section 205 proceeding.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b998-18\">In considering the changes in the positions of the parties, we find that while APCO might have demanded some procedure for permitting change of Interconnection Agreement terms, CP&amp;L had no apparent reason to change from a fixed-rate contract to a Section 205 procedure. The absence of any evidence of adequate consideration to CP&amp;L for total surrender of its fixed-rate contract rights reinforces the obvious grammatical interpretation of Section 5, i. e., that the \u201cauthorized\u201d provision was intended to qualify and limit the \u201cunilateral action\u201d provision preceeding [sic] it and to establish a 206 rather than a 205 procedure for effecting rate changes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b998-19\">F.P.C.

See text <em>supra </em>at notes 91-97. A comparison of the Appalachian rate-change provision with the one under review is revealing. Both expressly allow the parties to take action \u201cunilaterally\u201d with respect to desired changes in contract terms. APS\u2019s agreements specify that rates may be \u201cchanged\u201d only by the Commission, and the Appalachian agreement provided for changes \u201cauthorized\u201d by regulatory authority. We recognize that there were circumstances extrinsic to the Appalachian agreement that bore on its meaning, but there also are with respect to the APS-PTUA agreement. See text <em>infra </em>at notes 114-118. If, then, the Appalachian contract permits rate changes only Under \u00a7 206(a), we are at a loss to understand how APS\u2019s contracts can give it greater freedom. Indeed, we believe the APS agreements, even more clearly than the Appalachian agreement, must be read as prohibiting an effective rate change prior to a Commission order adjudicating the propriety of the new rates.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"106\">\n<p id=\"b1000-5\">.
