R. 18.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b367-10\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b367-11\">This <em>pro se </em>\u00a7 2255 motion represents the second time the Appellant Ward has sought post conviction relief from his 1971 conviction in the Northern District of Georgia for conveying within the Atlanta penitentiary a destructive device designed to kill, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1792.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b367-12\">The first \u00a7 2255 motion raised the issues of racial composition of the grand and petit juries involved in Ward\u2019s prosecution and trial. With respect to the grand jury question, the District Court\u2019s denial of relief was based on Ward\u2019s failure to raise the issue by a motion before trial in accordance with F.R.Civ.P. 12(b). Ward\u2019s challenge to the petit jury was denied because he did not allege specific facts to- support his conclusory allegations. This ruling was affirmed in <em>Ward </em>v. <em>United States, </em>1973, 5 Cir., 486 F.2d 305, <em>cert. denied, </em>1974, 416 U.S. 990, 94 S.Ct. 2398, 40 L.Ed.2d 768.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-13\">In the present motion, Ward again challenges the racial composition of the jury that tried him. However, his specific allegations are only that he was tried by an all-white jury, that 50 percent of the community from which the jury was selected was white, and that only two black persons were among the veniremen. He does not contend that the jury selection process was improper. Nor does he assert any facts from which this could be deduced. Therefore, we find the reasoning in our affirmance of Ward\u2019s prior \u00a7 2255 motion controlling on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-17\">Ward also contends he was inadequately represented because his appointed counsel did not challenge the jury before trial began. However, the jury selection process used in the Northern District of Georgia at that time has been held, on several occasions, to be constitutional and to comply with the Jury Selection and Service Act of 1968, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1861 et seq. <em>United States v. Roberts, </em>5 Cir., 546 F.2d 596, <em>cert. denied, </em>1977, 431 U.S. 968, 97 S.Ct. 2927, 53 L.Ed.2d 1064; <em>United States v. Dangler, </em>1971, 5 Cir., 422 F.2d 344; <em>Camp v. United States, </em>5 Cir., 413 F.2d 419, <em>cert. denied, </em>1969, 396 U.S. 968, 90 S.Ct. 451, 24 L.Ed.2d 434; <em>Simmons v. United States, </em>1969, 5 Cir., 406 F.2d 456. Therefore, Ward\u2019s counsel was not ineffective in failing to challenge the jury selection process.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-18\">We also find meritless the rest of Ward\u2019s assertions of inadequate representation: Counsel\u2019s failure to follow Ward\u2019s advice in the conduct of trial, in particular, to call an expert witness on the issue of fingerprint identification. See <em>United States v. Daniels, </em>1978, 5 Cir., 572 F.2d 535, 540. Counsel\u2019s failure to submit to Ward a proposed copy of his appellate brief. See <em>Hooks v. Roberts, </em>1973, 5 Cir., 480 F.2d 1196, 1196-97, c<em>ert. denied, </em>1974, 414 U.S. 1163, 94 S.Ct. 926, 39 L.Ed.2d 116. Counsel\u2019s failure to obtain a trial transcript for Ward\u2019s personal use on appeal. See <em>Shelton v. Beto, </em>5 Cir., 460 F.2d 1234, <em>cert. denied sub nom., Shelton v. Estelle, </em>1972, 409 U.S. 985, 93 S.Ct. 336, 34 L.Ed.2d 250.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-19\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b367-14\">. The conviction was affirmed <em>sub nom.
