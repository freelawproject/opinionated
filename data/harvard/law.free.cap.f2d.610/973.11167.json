We answer that question in the negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b1046-18\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1046-19\">After years of inconclusive effort to define a satisfactory relationship between broadcasting and cable<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in the provision of television programming,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the Commission in 1971 issued a \u201cLetter of Intent\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> incorporating a \u201csummary of the Commission\u2019s proposals for the near-term regulation of cable television.\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> This pronouncement adverted to a careful three-year revision of the Commission\u2019s earlier cable policies, and declared that \u201c[t]he policies put forward here result from an intensive study of the issues, balancing all the equities, and represent our best judgment on the regulatory course that should be followed.\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The letter of intent expressed the view that new copyright legislation was needed<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> in order to insure \u201cthe continued economic health of those who create program material,\u201d a matter deemed \u201ccrucial to both broadcasting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"975\">*975</page-number>and cable.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The Commission felt, however, that cable regulation and copyright protection could be separately considered,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and \u201cthat copyright policy is most appropriately left to Congress and the courts.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The Commission \u201cnote[d] the present efforts of the principals [in the controversy] to reach an agreement,\u201d and \u201chope[d] that these efforts [would] be fruitful.\u201d <footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1047-5\">Subsequently, the three major groups to be affected by the contemplated rules\u2014 broadcasters, cable operators and copyright owners \u2014 entered into a consensus agreement <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> proposing three modifications in regulations envisioned in the letter of intent with respect to cable carriage of television broadcast signals.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The Commission, in turn, \u201cbelieve[d] that adoption of the consensus agreement [would] markedly serve the public interest.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> This belief was founded on the expectation that adoption of the proposed modifications would facilitate the passage of new copyright legislation and the realization of the benefits anticipated therefrom.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> On this public-interest ground the Commission in 1972 chose the specifications of the consensus agreement in lieu of differing provisions of the letter of intent.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Late in 1976, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"976\">*976</page-number>Congress revised the copyright laws extensively.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1048-4\">Meanwhile, in 1974, Henry Geller, the petitioner here, asked the Commission to reexamine portions of the cable television rules and to revamp them suitably,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> in significant part by returning to particular regulatory provisions of the letter of intent that had been supplanted in the preference for the consensus agreement.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Prominent among Geller\u2019s complaints were contentions \u201cthat the Commission\u2019s 1972 cable television rules were in important respects not based on the Commission\u2019s judgment as to what would best serve the public interest, but rather on the need to adhere to the \u201cConsensus Agreement,\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> and \u201cthat the Commission can no longer validly adhere to provisions that do not, in its judgment, best serve the public interest in view of \u2018the undisputed fact that the agreement is now a dead letter.\u2019 \u201d <footnotemark>20</footnotemark> These arguments did not impress the Commission however. While, stating that it was \u201copen to proposals for changes in [its] cable television rules,\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> and that \u201c[additional changes in the rules [could] be anticipated in response to properly documented petitions for rulemaking or as part of [its] own continuing review of the rules,\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> the Commission concluded that Geller\u2019s petition did not \u201cprovide[] an appropriate vehicle for initiating further changes.\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Although it emphasized that past rulings clearly established that the consensus agreement interposed no barrier to modification of rules emanating from it,<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> the Commission perceived no occasion to reassess their validity on the basis of Geller\u2019s petition:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1048-13\">It was the Commission\u2019s judgment in 1972 that it would be in the overall public interest to adopt rules that closely followed the \u201cConsensus Agreement\u201d \u2014 that such rules not only served to protect the television broadcaster serving the public receivers but held forth the best prospect of fostering cable television growth within an appropriate and fair regulatory and legal context. The question for us now is whether all of the regulations adopted at that time remain justified. Although we are not prepared at this time to say they are contrary to the public interest, all of the rules are under review as part of our continuing re-regulation efforts. The petitions before us do not contain any evidence that aids us in making that judgment. We will, therefore, not institute the requested rulemaking proceedings at this time. Our overall review will continue, however, and we will remain receptive to properly documented suggestions for rule changes.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1048-14\">Then followed the petition for review now before us.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1049-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"977\">*977</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-5\">[I] We are confronted at the threshold by a jurisdictional problem. In this court Geller contends for the first time that the Commission erred when in 1972 it translated the regulatory modifications urged in the consensus agreement into rules for the governance of cable television. Geller charges that in so doing the Commission baldly adopted the compromise reached by the three involved industries on the controversy long besetting cable television, without providing other segments of the interested public with any opportunity for input into the decision to be made.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> Geller argues further, again for the first time, that the Commission\u2019s acceptance of the industry compact could not have been justified by the supposed need to facilitate the passage of new copyright legislation.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Not only are these arguments inappropriate for judicial consideration in the first instance<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> but they are also grossly untimely. Direct review of Commission orders must be initiated within a period of 60 days;<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> here the interval between finality of the rulemaking order and the instant petition for judicial review was almost five years.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> Resultantly, we lack jurisdiction to consider so much of Geller\u2019s presentation.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1049-11\">It does not follow, however, that Geller is completely out of court, for his challenge to the continuing vitality of the Commission\u2019s public-interest justification remains. The claim that the 1972 rule changes had fully served their stated purpose did not ripen until the new copyright legislation was enacted \u2014 just six weeks pri- or to the order denying Geller\u2019s request for additional rulemaking.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> Moreover, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"978\">*978</page-number><em>Functional Music, Inc. v. FCC,</em><footnotemark><em>34</em></footnotemark><em> </em>we found jurisdiction to consider, in a proceeding not begun until late 1957, the validity of Commission regulations formulated in 1955. We explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1050-4\">As applied to rules and regulations, the statutory time limit restricting judicial review of Commission action is applicable only to cut off review directly from the order promulgating a rule. It does not foreclose subsequent examination of a rule where properly brought before this court for review of further Commission action applying it. For unlike ordinary adjudicatory orders, administrative rules and regulations are capable of continuing application; limiting the right of review of the underlying rule would effectively deny many parties ultimately affected by a rule an opportunity to question its validity.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1050-5\">Had the Commission applied one or more of the 1972 regulations to the detriment of some individual, he would clearly have been in a position to complain of the order doing so. Had Geller emulated <em>Functional Music </em>in an unsuccessful petition to eliminate specific regulations on demonstrable grounds of invalidity, his right to judicial review seemingly would be unquestionable. Although, in this case, Geller asked the Commission to commence a new rulemaking proceeding,<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> the same result must follow. <em>Functional Music </em>makes clear that the period statutorily prescribed for judicial review of an administrative order governs only direct review of that order.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> Geller\u2019s petition in this court is for review, not of the 1972 order promulgating the contested rules, but of the 1976 order refusing to reexamine their continuing validity.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> To this extent, we have jurisdiction to entertain his complaint.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1050-13\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b1050-14\">In denying Geller\u2019s petition for new rule-making, the Commission stated, very accurately in our view, that \u201c[t]he question for [decision was] whether all of the regulations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"979\">*979</page-number>adopted [in 1972] remained] justified.\u201d<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> Although the Commission was \u201cnot prepared at [that] time to say they [were] contrary to the public interest,\u201d<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> it plainly was equally unprepared to say that the regulations were then consistent with the public interest.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> Nonetheless, the Commission declined to conduct an inquiry in that regard because \u201c[t]he petitions before [it did] not contain any evidence that aid[ed it] in making that judgment.\u201d <footnotemark>43</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1051-5\">Undeniably, an agency normally possesses a generous measure of discretion respecting the launching of rulemaking proceedings.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> But though the discretion typically is broad, its exercise is reviewable if plainly misguided.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> Already this court has twice applied that principle to vacate agency orders rejecting requests for rulemaking on the mistaken ground that the agency lacked jurisdiction to promulgate the regulations proposed.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> And it goes without saying that the agency cannot sidestep a reexamination of particular regulations when abnormal circumstances make that course imperative.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> That, we think, was the situation here. While the procedural vehicle Geller utilized was a petition for rulemaking, the far more important fact was that its allegations served to alert the Commission to the possibility that the regulations imported from the consensus agreement lacked a nexus with the public interest once the sought-after revision of the copyright laws was accomplished.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1051-18\">The relevant circumstances were rather clear to all. In 1972, the Commission had stated what from its viewpoint the public interest demanded in several aspects of cable television policy.<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> Some of the regulations that were to effectuate this public-interest determination were sacrificed to modifications proposed by the consensus agreement in a bid to facilitate the passage of copyright legislation.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> From late 1976 onward, however, once that objective was achieved,<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> this rationale could no longer support the rules derived from the agreement. Yet the Commission, despite previous assurances to the contrary,<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> continues to adhere to the rules adopted on the basis of the consensus agreement \u2014 rules that it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"980\">*980</page-number>has never found to serve the public interest in any other way.</p>\n<p id=\"b1052-4\">What we have, then, are cable television rules that may or may not presently square with the public interest. Even assuming that the rules in question initially were justified by the aid the Commission expected them to afford to enactment of the copyright legislation \u2014 a question we do not decide<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> \u2014 it is plain that that justification has long since evaporated. The Commission\u2019s general rulemaking power is expressly confined to promulgation of regulations that serve the public interest;<footnotemark>54</footnotemark> it \u201cmust place the public interest above private interests in carrying out its duties.\u201d<footnotemark>55</footnotemark> And, as the Second Circuit has so well put it, \u201c[t]he Commission may reach compromises, . . but it may not simply compromise between the interests of different broadcasting groups and gloss over the more fundamental public interest.\u201d <footnotemark>56</footnotemark> Even a statute depending for its validity upon a premise extant at the time of enactment may become invalid if subsequently that predicate disappears.<footnotemark>57</footnotemark> It can hardly be supposed that the vitality of conditions forging the vital link between Commission regulations and the public interest is any less essential to their continuing operation.<footnotemark>58</footnotemark> We hold that the Commission is statutorily bound to determine whether that linkage now exists.<footnotemark>59</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1053-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"981\">*981</page-number>The order under review is vacated, and the case is remanded to the Commission for further proceedings in light of the principles articulated herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b1053-4\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1046-11\">.

United Artists Television, Inc., </em>392 U.S. 390, 88 S.Ct. 2084, 20 L.Ed.2d 1176 (1968). There the Court ruled that cable television systems do not \u201cperform\u201d copyrighted works within the meaning of \u00a7\u00a7 1(c) and (d) of the Act. Although prior judicial construction of the 1909 Act had resulted in the treatment of broadcasters as \u201cperformers,\u201d the Court concluded that cable systems merely enhance the capacity of viewers to receive broadcast signals and therefore do not \u201cperform\u201d the programs they intercept and carry. <em>Id. </em>at 398-400, 88 S.Ct. 2084.

The modifications proposed in the consensus agreement dealt with television broadcast signal carriage, the subject of Part I of the Commission\u2019s letter of intent. The suggested changes were described by the Commission as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1047-12\">(i) <em>Exclusivity. </em>For syndicated programming, the agreement provides for extensive exclusivity in the top 50 markets, and more limited exclusivity in markets 51-100. For network programming, it substitutes simultaneous for same-day protection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1047-13\">(ii) <em>Local signals. </em>The agreement changes the significant viewing standard applied to out-of-market independent stations in overlapping market situations from a one percent share of viewing hours to a two percent share; it does not alter the standard applied to network affiliates.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1047-14\">(iii) <em>Leapfrogging. </em>The agreement retains a UHF priority where a third distant signal is carried but changes the requirements for the first two signals. There is no restriction on these signals as to point of origin, except that if either is taken from any of the top 25 markets it must be from one of the two closest such markets. In the August 5 Letter these signals were, in effect, channels of independent programming (conceivably a blend of several distant stations); now they are restricted to specified distant stations except during exclusivity protection periods.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1047-17\"><em>Id. </em>at 166.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b1047-18\">. <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b1047-19\">. In its entirety, the Commission\u2019s exposition on this score was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1047-20\">(i) First, the agreement will facilitate the passage of cable copyright legislation. It is essential that cable be brought within the television distribution market. There have been several attempts to do so, but all have foundered on the opposition of one or more of the three industries involved. It is for this reason that Congress and the Commission have long urged the parties to compromise their differences.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1047-21\">(ii) Passage of copyright legislation will in turn erase an uncertainty that now impairs cable\u2019s ability to attract the capital investment needed for substantial growth. The development of the industry, at least with respect to assessing copyright costs, would be settled by the new copyright legislation and its future no longer tied to the outcome of pending litigation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1047-22\">(iii) Finally, the enactment of cable copyright legislation by Congress \u2014 with the Commission\u2019s program before it \u2014 would in effect reaffirm the Commission\u2019s jurisdiction to carry out that program, including such important features as access to television facilities. It is important to emphasize that for full effectiveness the consensus agreement requires Congressional approval, not just that of the Commission. The rule will, of course, be put into effect promptly. Without Congressional validation, however, we would have to re-examine some aspects of the program. Congress, we believe, will share our conclusion that implementation of the agreement clearly serves the public interest.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1047-23\"><em>Id. </em>at 166-167.

Geller seeks to avoid the consequences of his failure first to present these contentions to the Commission by reminding this court that Commissioner Johnson advanced similar points in his dissenting opinion in the 1972 proceeding. <em>Cable Television Report &amp; Order, supra </em>note 11, 36 F.C.C.2d at 306. We have held that arguments raised by dissenting commissioners in administrative proceedings could properly be brought before this court in an action for judicial review, even though neither party had pressed such arguments before the Commission. <em>Office of Communication of United Church of Christ v. FCC, </em>150 U.S.App.D.C. 339, 343, 465 F.2d 519, 523 (1972). When an administrative decision is made, there is a strong presumption that the officials who espouse the majority position have conscientiously considered the views of their colleagues. <em>Braniff Airways, Inc. v. CAB, </em>126 U.S.App.D.C. 399, 406, 379 F.2d 453, 460 (1967). The dissenting opinion relied on by Geller, however, was part of an entirely separate proceeding in which petitioner did not participate. The Commission could not have been fairly on notice when Geller made his 1974 rulemaking request that it must deal with arguments long since presumably laid to rest. Moreover, in his rulemaking petition Geller specifically informed the Commission that he was \u201cnot attacking the validity of the Commission\u2019s decision in 1972 to adopt the provisions of the consensus agreement.\u201d Joint Appendix 117.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"30\">\n<p id=\"b1049-13\">. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2344 (1976).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"31\">\n<p id=\"b1049-14\">.

A general rule implies that a commission need not re-study the entire problem de novo and reconsider policy every time it receives an application for waiver of the rule. On the other hand, a general rule, deemed valid because its overall objectives are in the public interest, may not be in the \u201cpublic interest\u201d if extended to an applicant who proposes a new service that will not undermine the policy, served by the rule, that has been adjudged in the public interest.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1052-17\">135 U.S.App.D.C. at 321, 418 F.2d at 1157.

With an interrelationship between Commission rules and the public interest statutorily mandated, we think the need to revisit the regulations contested here is no less inexorable. In that view, we do not encounter the strictures on imposition of judicially-created requirements on the rulemaking process recently highlighted in <em>Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Corp. v.

We do not mean to imply that this inquiry must necessarily be conducted in a new rule-making proceeding, as requested by Geller, so long as it is promptly pursued in some suitable manner.

We say only that the Commission must reexamine the regulatory remnants of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"981\">*981</page-number>consensus agreement for some discernible contribution to the public interest, and we leave to the Commission in the first instance the procedures through which that will be done.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
