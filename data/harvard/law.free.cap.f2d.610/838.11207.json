FCC, </em>165 U.S. App.D.C. 185, 506 F.2d 246 (1974) (en <em>banc), </em>this court, always in the context of the Federal Communications Commission\u2019s statutory responsibility to pass upon voluntary assignments of radio licenses, construed that responsibility as comprehending the issue of whether the proposed abandonment of a distinctive programing format was in the public interest. In particular, we said that, where a significant sector of the listening community, in opposition to the assignment, protests the loss of such a format by substantial factual allegations that it is both unique and financially viable, the statute requires that the Commission hold a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-20\">Thereafter the Commission, after notice and comment proceedings, issued a \u201cpolicy statement\u201d disagreeing with <em>WEFM, </em>arguing that the public interest in diversity of entertainment formats is best served by unregulated competition among licensees, and urging this court to repudiate the approach it has taken. <em>Memorandum Opinion and Order, </em>60 F.C.C.2d 858 (1976) <em>[Policy Statement]; </em>66 F.C.C.2d 78 (1977) <em>[Denial of Reconsideration </em>]. Citizens groups interested in fostering and preserving distinctive entertainment formats petitioned this court for review.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> We set the case for hearing <em>en banc </em>because no panel of the court could overrule our <em>en banc </em>holding in <em>WEFM </em>as the Commission requested.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Unpersuaded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"842\">*842</page-number>that our reading of the Act is wrong, we decline the Commission\u2019s invitation to announce our abandonment of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b914-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-6\">The basic premise of our format cases <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> is that the Communications Act\u2019s \u201cpublic interest, convenience, and necessity\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> standard includes a concern for diverse entertainment programing. Congress set aside the radio spectrum as a public resource and acted to secure its benefits, not only to those in the cultural mainstream, but to <em>\u201call </em>the people\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> of our richly pluralistic society. It \u201cis surely in the public interest,\u201d therefore, \u201cas that was conceived of by a Congress representative of all the people, for all major aspects of contemporary culture to be accommodated by the commonly-owned public resources whenever that is technically and economically feasible.\u201d <em>Citizens Committee to Preserve the Voice of Arts in Atlanta v. FCC, </em>141 U.S.App.D.C. 109, 115, 436 F.2d 263, 269 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b914-7\">Congress delegated to the Commission the task of ensuring that the license grants are used in the public interest. In particular, the Commission must sometimes consider the loss of diversity (together with other factors bearing on the public interest) when deciding assignment applications involving abandonment of existing formats. It must take a \u201chard look\u201d at the salient problems, including loss of diversity, when making this public interest determination. <em>Greater Boston Television Corp. v. FCC, </em>143 U.S.App.D.C. 383, 393, 444 F.2d 841, 851 (1970), <em>cert. denied, </em>403 U.S. 923, 91 S.Ct. 2229, 29 L.Ed.2d 701 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b914-16\">The Commission need not consider the public interest implications of format abandonment, however, when there are compelling indications that the loss in diversity is not serious or that the assignment is otherwise clearly in the public interest. For example, if notice of the change does not precipitate an outpouring of protest,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the Commission may properly assume that the proposed format is acceptable.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Similarly, even if a committed and vocal minority engages in significant public grumbling, no public interest issue is raised if their preferred format is the choice of a population segment too small to be accommodated by the available frequencies.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Finally, no public interest issue arises if there is an adequate substitute for the endangered format within the service area.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In these situations the evidence is strong that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"843\">*843</page-number>assignment will not result in a troublesome diminution of format diversity. Further, if the format itself is shown to be economically unfeasible in the particular <em>market </em>\u2014 i. e., if even an efficiently managed station would have no realistic prospect of economic viability \u2014 then abandonment of the existing format does not contravene the public interest and the Commission need not pursue by hearing the alleged loss of diversity.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b915-5\">If the record presents substantial questions of fact material to the public interest, including the public interest in diversity, the Commission must hold an evidentiary hearing.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> However, no hearing is required when the record presents no substantial questions of material fact. If the only issues of substance are the inferences and legal conclusions to be drawn from known facts, the Commission is free to make the public interest determination and decide the application before it.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Even when the record otherwise presents substantial fact issues, a hearing is unnecessary if undisputed facts establish any one of those situations discussed above in which no public interest issue arises. Thus, a hearing</p>\n<p id=\"b915-11\">will rarely be needed to determine that (1) there has been no out pouring of public protest to the format change, (2) the endangered format\u2019s devotees are too few to be accommodated by the available frequencies, (3) there is an adequate substitute in the service area,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> or (4) the format itself is financially unviable.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b915-12\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-13\">In response to our <em>WEFM </em>decision the Commission on January 19, 1976 proposed to reexamine the format question. <em>Development of Policy Re: Changes in the Entertainment Formats of Broadcast Stations, </em>57 F.C.C.2d 580 (1976) <em>[Notice of Inquiry </em>]. It expressed \u201cdeep[] concern[]\u201d that <em>WEFM </em>threatened \u201cserious adverse consequences for the public interest,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 582, and doubted that \u201ca system of pervasive governmental regulation,\u201d <em>id., </em>could do a better job than concededly imperfect market forces. The \u201cquagmire\u201d of administratively distinguishing among formats militated against regulation, as did the possibility that broadcasters, to avoid being locked in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"844\">*844</page-number>to an unprofitable format, would cease experimenting with unusual programing approaches. <em>Id. </em>at 582-84. The \u201cpolicy,\u201d as the Commission chose to characterize it, imposed by this court also raised questions under the First Amendment warranting \u201cprompt and thorough review.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 585. The Commission, in short, was \u201cconcerned that the course charted by the Court may lead only to expense, delay and stagnation, with no assurance that a decision finally reached by the Commission would be in any sense superior to (or more in the public interest than) that favored by the marketplace.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 584.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-4\">In light of these misgivings, the Commission proposed to reconsider whether it \u201cshould play any role in dictating the selection of entertainment formats.\u201d <em>Id. </em>It solicited public comments on the statutory and constitutional considerations described above. It also invited \u201c[p]arties who favor some degree of government involvement\u201d to address a number of questions <footnotemark>14</footnotemark> bearing on the practical implementation of <em>WEFM.</em><footnotemark><em>15</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b916-15\">Comments were filed, and on July 30, 1976, the Commission repudiated the <em>WEFM </em>decision on four principal grounds. First, <em>WEFM </em>misread the Communications Act because it imposed \u201ccommon carrier-like\u201d obligations in violation of congressional intent that broadcasters compete freely<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"845\">*845</page-number>and not function as common carriers.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> <em>Policy Statement, supra, </em>60 F.C.C.2d at 859-61. Second, the administrative record \u2014 in particular a Commission staff study appended to the <em>Policy Statement </em>\u2014demonstrated that competition was highly effective in producing format diversity. Competition, in the Commission\u2019s view, has resulted in an \u201calmost bewildering array\u201d of formats in major markets, <em>id. </em>at 863, and has facilitated listener choice among stations broadcasting the same format, <em>id. </em>at 863-64; conversely, regulation under <em>WEFM </em>would probably deter innovative programing. <em>Id. </em>at 865. Third, administering <em>WEFM </em>would pose vexing administrative problems: formats are difficult to categorize and the costs of a hearing would be enormous, particularly since the doctrine applies logically in license renewals as well as in assignment applications. <em>Id. </em>at 861-63, 864-65. Finally, <em>WEFM </em>improperly invaded First Amendment interests by chilling broadcasters\u2019 programming choices and by imposing an obligation to continue service. In short, <em>WEFM </em>would impose \u201ccomprehensive, discriminating, and continuing state surveillance,\u201d <footnotemark>18</footnotemark> which the Commission believed</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b917-5\">would be flatly inconsistent with our understanding of congressional policy as manifested in the Communications Act, contraproductive in terms of maximizing the welfare of the radio-listening public, administratively a fearful and comprehensive nightmare, and unconstitutional as impermissibly chilling innovation and experimentation in radio programming.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ag9\"><em>Id. </em>at 865\u201466.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-12\">The <em>Policy Statement </em>concluded with a comment on the \u201cpartnership\u201d between the Commission and the Court of Appeals. <em>Id. </em>at 865, <em>citing Greater Boston Television Corp. v. FGG, </em>143 U.S.App.D.C. 383, 444 F.2d 841, 851-52 (1970), <em>cert. denied, </em>403 U.S. 923, 91 S.Ct. 2229, 29 L.Ed.2d 701 (1971). In the Commission\u2019s view, \u201cwhen such \u2018partners\u2019 come to a point of fundamental disagreement, it is incumbent upon us to take a step back and rethink our entire position if this relationship is to be creative rather than destructive.\u201d 60 F.C. C.2d at 865. The Commission contended that in the present docket it had engaged in such a reconsideration; by implication, it requested this court also to take a step back and rethink our <em>WEFM </em>decision. However, the Commission vowed to implement fully <em>WEFM\u2019s </em>specific mandate that a hearing be held in that case. Further, it stayed implementation of its \u201cnew policy\u201d until the completion of judicial review thereof. <em>Id. </em>at 866.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b918-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"846\">*846</page-number>The Commission attached two appendices to its <em>Policy Statement. </em>Appendix A was a summary of the comments pro and con on the various issues raised by the <em>Notice of Inquiry. </em>Appendix B was a staff document, prepared after the close of the comment period, which argued on theoretical and empirical grounds that <em>WEFM </em>was not superior to the free market and that competition among licensees had resulted in a high degree of format diversity. Using statistical techniques to test the hypothesis that format type has no effect on audience <em>ratings </em>\u2014 i. <em>e., </em>roughly, that the degree of variation in audience share among stations programing the same format was as great as the variation among stations programing different formats \u2014 the staff concluded that, although format type did have a statistically significant impact on audience share, the magnitude of that impact was small. In the staff\u2019s view, this study demonstrated <em>WEFM\u2019s </em>\u201cdecisive flaw\u201d in assuming that duplication of stations within a format is wasteful in terms of listener satisfaction. <em>Id. </em>at 873.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-4\">On August 25, 1977, the Commission refused to reconsider the <em>Policy Statement. Denial of Reconsideration, supra.</em><footnotemark><em>20</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b918-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b918-6\">Although the Commission claims to have taken a \u201cstep back\u201d and impartially reexamined the issue, its treatment of the format decisions, and of citizens groups seeking to enforce them, has been such as to cast serious doubt on the rationality and impartiality of its action. Two facets of the <em>Policy Statement </em>stand out in this connection: the Commission\u2019s reliance on a previously undisclosed staff study, and its contention that enforcing <em>WEFM </em>would be an \u201cadministrative nightmare.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b918-8\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-9\">Even a brief perusal of the <em>Policy Statement </em>reveals that the staff study, which was issued as Appendix B thereto, had a major influence on the decision. The Commission cited it in the body of the <em>Policy Statement </em>as showing \u201cdecisively . how effective the tool of competition has been in carrying out Congress\u2019 plan for entertainment programming\u201d;<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> as supporting the conclusion that \u201cthe marketplace is the best way to allocate entertainment formats in radio\u201d;<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> and as strongly indicating that listeners carefully discriminate among stations programing the same format.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> In view of the study\u2019s importance, we might have expected that, before reaching a decision, the Commission would release it for adversarial testing of its data base, methodology, and conclusions. <em>See generally United States v. Nova Scotia Food Products Corp., </em>568 F.2d 240, 251\u201452 (2d Cir. 1977); <em>Portland Cement Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>Ruckelshaus, </em>158 U.S.App.D.C. 308, 486 F.2d 375, 392-94 (1973), <em>cert. denied, </em>417 U.S. 921, 94 S.Ct. 2628, 41 L.Ed.2d 226 (1974); <em>International Harvester Co. v. Ruckelshaus, </em>155 U.S.App.D.C. 411, 427-29, 478 F.2d 615, 631-33 (1973). Yet it appears that, prior to the issuance of the <em>Policy Statement, </em>only the Commission itself knew of the study\u2019s existence.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-10\">The Commission\u2019s failure to disclose this important technical document for public comment not only diminishes the assurance that its decision is substantively accurate, but also raises questions of procedural fairness to the parties opposed thereto. Aggravating the procedural aspect in the present case are certain statements made by the Commission in response to inquiries from citizens groups. Several times during the comment period, for example, petitioners requested the Commission to contract for an independent study of format diversity, J.A. at 145, 153; <em>id. </em>at 160, 161; <em>id. </em>at 237, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"847\">*847</page-number>238. Petitioners argued that the <em>Notice of Inquiry </em>lacked a sufficient data base, that the industry-commissioned studies filed during the comment period were biased, and that petitioners did not have the resources to fund their own studies. The Commission denied these requests on February 19, 1976, and May 24, 1976, J.A. at 164, 169, <em>id. </em>at 247, 248. On March 29, 1976 \u2014 four months before the issuance of the <em>Policy Statement </em>\u2014the Commission\u2019s Broadcast Bureau responded to a Freedom of Information Act request for \u201call data, reports and memoran-da utilized or proposed to be utilized by the Commission in this proceeding,\u201d J.A. at 48, without indicating that it planned to use a staff study in deciding the <em>Inquiry. </em>Although perhaps accurate when made, these statements created the somewhat misleading impression, which the Commission could usefully have corrected, that no studies would be undertaken.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-5\">The Commission argues that the parties had an adequate opportunity to comment on the study on petition for reconsideration. The heavy burden on any petitioner for reconsideration, however, surely makes the opportunity to comment at this stage a less than adequate substitute for the chance to influence the Commission\u2019s initial decision. That the Commission was not open-minded at this stage is evident from the record. It apparently required a Freedom of Information Act request for petitioner Citizens Communications Center to obtain a description of the methodology used in preparing the study. J.A. at 68-87. This description was provided on September 15, 1976, two weeks after the expiration on the time period for reconsideration petitions.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-6\">Even if we accepted at face value the Commission\u2019s representation that it would have considered a request for reconsideration filed out of time if based on newly-disclosed material, our misgivings would not be fully assuaged. The Commission\u2019s Freedom of Information Act response contained computer worksheets which were obscure if not incomprehensible to readers lacking a key to the meaning of the figures. Citizens Communications Center requested such a key in a letter to the Commission dated March 22, 1977. J.A. at 100-100A. The Commission\u2019s response, which contained such a key, <em>see </em>J.A. at 573-75, was apparently sent only to the Citizens Communications Center and not to other petitioners as might have been expected had the Commission acted out of a good faith desire to obtain comments on the study. Some petitioners claim that the first they knew of this key was when the Commission designated it for inclusion in the Joint Appendix filed in this court. In short, it is open to serious question whether even after issuance of the <em>Policy Statement </em>the petitioners were given information about the study\u2019s design and data base sufficient to allow meaningful comment thereon, and whether, if such comment had been feasible, the Commission would have received it with an open mind.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b919-9\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-10\">One of the Commission\u2019s principal grounds for repudiating the format decisions was the contention that implementing them would be an \u201cadministrative nightmare,\u201d imposing \u201cenormous costs on the participants and the Commission alike.\u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> The hearing on remand from the <em>WEFM </em>decision, which was said to be \u201cfairly typical\u201d of format abandonment proceedings, involved the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b919-11\">[A]n administrative law judge held two prehearing conferences in Washington, D.C.; his preparation time was an additional eight hours. In addition the Broadcast Bureau trial staff spent above two hundred man-hours of preparation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"848\">*848</page-number>time. Subsequently, hearings were held on nine separate dates in Washington, D.C., and on nine different dates in Chicago, from which a transcript of 3120 pages was compiled. Following the hearings, the Broadcast Bureau spent two hundred and forty hours preparing proposed findings of fact and the administrative law judge will have spent approximately two hundred and eighty hours preparing his initial decision.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aa3r\">The Commission was particularly concerned with the burden of such hearings because, in its view, they would also be required when a licensee that had changed its format mid-term (without transferring the license) applied to the Commission for license renewal.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b920-4\">While we do not wish to minimize the burdens of a format abandonment hearing, the truth is that in the sunlight of the facts the Commission\u2019s \u201cadministrative nightmare\u201d turns out to be little more than a dream. The Commission professes that it has sought in good faith to administer format changes ever since the <em>Atlanta </em>decision in 1970. An examination of the actual burdens imposed on the Commission by the cases that have reached this court during that period \u2014 all involving license assignment applications \u2014 is highly instructive.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-5\">In <em>Atlanta, </em>this court reversed the Commission\u2019s approval without a hearing of a license assignment involving a change from classical music to a \u201c \u2018blend of popular favorites, Broadway hits, musical standards, and light classics,\u2019 \u201d 141 U.S.App.D.C. at 111, 436 F.2d at 265, and remanded the case for an evidentiary hearing on the alleged unprofitability of the existing operation, the accuracy with which views of prominent citizens were represented, and the degree to which listeners were provided with classical music from other broadcast sources. However, no hearing was held on remand because the parties settled the matter among themselves. In <em>Progressive Rock </em>we remanded a case involving a proposed shift from \u201cprogressive rock\u201d to \u201cmiddle of the road\u201d for a hearing on the issues of financial viability and alternative sources of the format. Again the parties apparently settled the dispute and no hearing was held. In <em>Lakeland, </em>a case involving a proposed switch from \u201call-news\u201d to \u201ccountry and western,\u201d we found no substantial dispute over the issues of financial viability and alternative sources of the format, and hence upheld the Commission\u2019s approval of the application without a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-8\">Finally, in <em>WEFM, </em>we remanded a case involving a switch from classical to rock music for a hearing on the questions of financial viability, accuracy of community leader surveys, and availability of alternative sources. A hearing was held, and the Administrative Law Judge issued an initial decision proposing to grant the application. <em>Zenith Radio Corp., </em>F.C.C. 76D-47 (1976), 76D-46 (1977). Subsequently, however, the parties agreed to a settlement in which the petitioner to deny agreed to withdraw its objection in exchange for certain actions designed to strengthen alternative sources of classical music in the listening area. The Commission approved the settlement. <em>Zenith Radio Corp., </em>F.C.C. 78\u2014102, 42 Pike &amp; Fischer Radio Reg.2d 472 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b920-9\">In light of this history, the Commission\u2019s fears appear somewhat less than realistic. In nearly ten years, a mere handful of format change cases have reached this court. Of these, <em>one </em>\u2014 <em>Lakewood </em>\u2014 resulted in the Commission\u2019s being affirmed on grounds indicating that in many cases no hearing would be required. <em>Two </em>\u2014 Atlanta and <em>Progressive Rock </em>\u2014 were remanded but were settled before a hearing could be held. In the entire history of the format cases, only <em>one case </em>\u2014 <em>WEFM </em>\u2014 has resulted in a hearing; and even this was settled prior to administrative appellate procedures. The hearing that did occur, although by no means inconsequential in scope, was nevertheless less extensive than the typical com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"849\">*849</page-number>parative renewal proceeding<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Nor does the burden promise to be significantly greater in the future. At oral argument, the Commission\u2019s counsel, upon inquiry from the bench, estimated that \u201cperhaps half a dozen\u201d petitions to deny based on format changes were then pending. If past experience is a guide, few, if any, of these will eventuate in a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-4\">The Commission also argues that the administrative burden is excessive because format hearings will be required in the renewal as well as the transfer context. We do agree that the format cases logically apply to renewal applications<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> But we do not believe that renewals will open the floodgates to the administrative hearing room, because the safeguards against excessive numbers of hearings are as present in the renewal context as in the assignment context. No hearing will be required on a renewal application if the abandoned format is financially unviable, if it is not unique in the listening area, or if there has been an insufficient outpouring of public protest against the change.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-5\">Apparently recognizing its untenability, the Commission\u2019s counsel, at oral argument before us, conceded that the \u201cadministrative nightmare\u201d characterization was- an \u201cexaggeration\u201d and personally assured the court that the argument was not \u201cvery significant at all\u201d to the Commission\u2019s decision. Yet this concession does not retroactively make rational the Commission\u2019s ill-advised reliance on the issue. And we cannot but view with considerable suspicion an administrative agency\u2019s decision that lays such stress \u2014 to the point of almost frenzied rhetorical excess \u2014 on an argument which, in light of the actual facts, appears so lacking in merit.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b921-13\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b921-14\">The staff study and administrative nightmare issues are merely the most striking examples of certain more pervasive problems. Throughout the format controversy, the Commission has displayed a deep-seated aversion to the decisions of this court (and to the advocates of those decisions) while at the same time misinterpreting and exaggerating their meaning. Perhaps as a result of these interrelated defects, the Commission failed to take affirmative steps to minimize what it perceived as the intrusive features of the format decisions while preserving their essence.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-15\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-16\">It has been evident from the start that the Commission\u2019s response to the format decisions would be something less than enthusiastic cooperation. Professing time and again that entertainment programing is very broadly, if not wholly, committed to licensee discretion,<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> the Commission has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"850\">*850</page-number>never initiated a hearing in a format change case and has repeatedly urged this court to reverse or drastically, curtail the decisions.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> And it instituted the present proceeding in the nature of rulemaking with the apparent purpose of overruling the <em>WEFM </em>case. Whatever its power generally to proceed by rulemaking rather than adjudication, we think it a somewhat different matter when the seeming purpose of the rulemaking is the circumvention of a recent court decision reached in an adjudicatory context.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-4\">These misgivings are not allayed by the record of the present proceeding. It hardly requires a literary critic to discern that the <em>Notice of Inquiry\u2019s \u201cquestions\u201d </em>about <em>WEFM </em>were for the most part rhetorical. Those favoring <em>WEFM </em>could not have been heartened to read of the Commission\u2019s \u201cdeep[ ] concern[ ]\u201d that <em>WEFM </em>\u201cmay lead only to expense, delay and stagnation, with no assurance that a decision finally reached by the Commission would be in any sense superior to that favored by the marketplace,\u201d and that the decision might cause \u201cserious adverse consequences for the public interest.\u201d 57 F.C.C.2d at 582, 584, 582. The indications in the <em>Notice of Inquiry </em>that the Commission would not give pro-<em>WEFM </em>comments due consideration were borne out by later events. Its <em>Policy Statement, </em>as we have noted at length, relied heavily on a staff study which had not been placed in the record for public comment. Moreover, the Commission ignored completely comments which it had solicited, <em>see </em>note 14 <em>supra, </em>concerning how <em>WEFM </em>could effectively be administered.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b922-8\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-9\">Closely related to the Commission\u2019s innate aversion to our format decisions is its sometimes drastic misreading of those cases. It analyzed the problem in stark terms: formats are to be chosen <em>either </em>by market forces <em>or </em>by \u201cthe alternative to the imperfect system of free competition . . . a system of broadcast programming by government decree.\u201d <em>Denial of Reconsideration, supra, </em>66 F.C.C.2d at 81. <em>WEFM, </em>in the Commission\u2019s view, is the antithesis of the free market: it mandates a \u201csystem of pervasive governmental regulation,\u201d <em>Notice of Inquiry, supra, </em>57 F.C.C.2d at 582, requiring \u201ccomprehensive, discriminating, and continuing state surveillance.\u201d <em>Policy Statement, supra, </em>60 F.C.C.2d at 865, <em>citing Lemon v. Kurtzman, </em>403 U.S. 602, 619, 91 S.Ct. 2105, 2114, 29 L.Ed.2d 745 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b922-10\">Having framed its analysis in Manichae-an terms, it is not surprising that the Commission found numerous flaws in our format cases. There would no doubt be severe statutory and constitutional difficulties with any system that required intrusive governmental surveillance, dictated pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"851\">*851</page-number>graming choices, forced broad access obligations, or imposed an obligation to continue in service under any and all circumstances. Moreover, any system of pervasive regulation of the type envisaged by the Commission would indeed be an \u201cadministrative nightmare,\u201d a \u201cquagmire\u201d that the agency would be well-advised to avoid.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-5\">The truth is that the actual features of <em>WEFM </em>are scarcely visible in this highly-colored portrait. As we have emphasized before and repeat today, <em>WEFM </em>was <em>not </em>intended as an alternative to format allocation by market forces. We fully recognized that market forces do generally provide diversification of formats. The licensee\u2019s discretion over programing matters is therefore very broad while the Commission\u2019s role is correspondingly narrow.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> However, we also recognized \u2014 as does the Commission\u2014 that the radio market is an imperfect reflection of listener preferences. Because broadcasters earn their revenues from advertising, they tend to serve young adults with large discretionary incomes in preference to demographically less desirable groups like children, the elderly, or the poor. <em>See WEFM, supra, </em>165 U.S.App.D.C. at 207, 506 F.2d at 268.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-6\">Further, as is clear from our earlier cases, the Commission\u2019s obligation to consider format issues arises only when there is strong prima facie evidence that the market has in fact broken down. No public interest issue is raised if (1) there is an adequate substitute in the service area for the format being abandoned, (2) there is no substantial support for the endangered format as evidenced by an outcry of public protest, (3) the devotees of the endangered format are too few to be served by the available frequencies, or (4) the format is not financially viable. <em>See </em>text accompanying notes 5-9 <em>supra. </em>One or another of these factors is surely present in most format changes. And generally the existence <em>vel non </em>of these factors can be determined without the need for a hearing. The small remainder of cases are simply those in which the evidence strongly indicates that market mechanisms have not satisfied the Communications Act\u2019s mandate that radio serve the needs of all the people.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-8\">As we have observed in Part II <em>supra, </em>the Commission\u2019s administrative nightmare argument is seen to have little merit when it is remembered that only one of the handful of format cases reaching this court has resulted in a hearing. Also unpersuasive, in this regard, is the Commission\u2019s contention that <em>WEFM </em>mandates an unconstitutional, or at least statutorily proscribed, intrusion on licensee programing discretion. The Commission laid particular stress on the argument that licensees will be deterred from experimenting with unusual formats out of a fear of being locked in. But it has provided little or no evidence that <em>WEFM </em>has in fact deterred licensees\u2019 format choices; quite to the contrary, the Commission\u2019s staff study concluded that under the <em>WEFM </em>regime licensees have been aggressive in developing diverse entertainment formats.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-9\">Finally, we must emphasize the narrowness of the Commission\u2019s remedial powers. It merely has the power to take a station\u2019s format into consideration in deciding whether to grant certain applications. It has no authority under <em>WEFM </em>to interfere with licensee programing choices: it cannot restrain the broadcasting of any program, dictate adoption of a new format, force retention of an existing format, or command provision of access to non-licensees. To say that it is empowered to impose censorship<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> or common carrier<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> obli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"852\">*852</page-number>gations is to stretch <em>WEFM </em>virtually beyond recognition.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b924-4\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-5\">The Commission would likely have been less concerned had it read our format cases more accurately; conversely, it would probably have better interpreted those cases had it viewed them more sympathetically. The flaws in its approach are intimately connected. They intersect in the Commission\u2019s failure to implement the cases so as to minimize their drawbacks while preserving their essence. Had it attempted to develop administrative standards instead of simply abdicating, it might well have discovered that many perceived \u201cflaws\u201d could be lessened or eliminated altogether.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-10\">The impetus for developing such standards must come, in the first instance, from the Commission. Only it, and not this court, has the expertise to formulate rules well-tailored to the intricacies of radio broadcasting, and the flexibility to adjust those rules to changing conditions. Only it has the opportunity to develop standards of general applicability outside an <em>ad hoc </em>adjudicatory context. And only it has the power to determine how to perform its regulatory function within the substantive and procedural bounds of applicable law.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-11\">The Commission has not suffered from the want of suggestions along these lines. Scholars have noted that it could develop acceptable guidelines.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> This court has emphasized the Commission\u2019s discretion to develop administrative standards,<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> and stressed that judicial review thereof will be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"853\">*853</page-number>limited and deferential.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> The Commission itself has recognized the need for standard-setting. Commissioner Hooks, concurring in the <em>Notice of Inquiry, </em>suggested standards for the sympathetic implementation of <em>WEFM; </em><footnotemark>41</footnotemark> and the Commission majority, in the same document, requested comments on administering the decision.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> It is regrettable, from the present perspective, that rather than pursuing this approach the Commission chose simply to throw up its hands. While we cannot, of course, dictate what, if any, standards the Commission should adopt, the following suggests ways in which development of appropriate guidelines could satisfy many of its objectives.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-4\">One difficulty noted by the Commission and intervening commercial broadcasters is the alleged impossibility of classifying radio formats. They point to our statement that \u201cwe know [a format] when [we hear] it,\u201d<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> as being overly subjective, and to some of the distinctions we have drawn between formats as being nice to the point of administrative infeasibility.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> Yet these were the judgments of a court forced to decide the case before it by reference to the language of the Communications Act and the Congressional purpose informing it. The Commission, with its greater expertise and broad overview of the subject matter, could arrive by rulemaking at a format taxonomy which, even if imprecise at the margins, would be sustainable so long as not irrational.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> The Commission \u201cretains a discretion commensurate with its expertise to make reasonable categorical determinations,\u201d <em>WEFM, supra, </em>165 U.S.App.D.C. at 204, 506 F.2d at 265. Had it developed a rational classification schema in the first instance, this court would surely have given it great credence even if the results reached thereunder differed from those obtained by application of our own unguided analysis.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b925-12\">Indeed, the Commission used a format classification in its staff study to demonstrate the existence of broad diversity in major radio markets. There is a marked inconsistency in its endorsing the validity of a study largely premised on classifications it claims are impossible to make. In any case, the schema used in the staff study follows accepted industry usage and would appear facially rational. It is likely that the perceived administrative difficulties would be greatly reduced if the Commission were to adopt a similar approach.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b926-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"854\">*854</page-number>With regard to <em>WEFM\u2019s </em>perceived intrusiveness, the Commission could set rigorous standards as to when petitioners to deny have established a prima facie case. It could, for example, require a relatively high level of public grumbling, could classify formats into broader rather than narrower categories, and could place the burden of demonstrating \u201cuniqueness\u201d on the petitioners.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> To deal with the \u201clock in\u201d problem it could exempt from the hearing requirement formats adopted experimentally and sought to be abandoned after a very short period of time.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-4\">In the analogous context of the fairness doctrine, the Commission has adopted stringent prima facie case requirements that weed out, at the outset, the great majority of complaints. We recently upheld, <em>en banc, </em>the Commission\u2019s dismissal of a fairness doctrine complaint based on those rigorous standards. <em>American Security Council Education Foundation v. FCC, </em>197 U.S.App.D.C. 124, 607 F.2d 438 (1979). We noted that the prima facie evidence requirement served to protect delicate First Amendment values by ensuring that robust, wide-open debate would not be deterred. Like the fairness doctrine, the format cases involve the Commission in an area charged with sensitive First Amendment implications. The Commission could surely use a similar technique in the format context for accommodating First Amendment values to the fact that broadcasters, under the scheme of the Communications Act, are public trustees obligated to serve the public interest.<footnotemark>49</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b926-5\">\u25a0None of this is to imply, however, that the Commission is free to \u201cadminister\u201d the format cases as a dead letter.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> Whatever administrative means the Commission adopts must be capable of identifying and rectifying those infrequent situations in which market allocation <em>has </em>failed and in which the public interest would not be served by granting the assignment application. That is the basic message of our format change cases as to what Congress has willed in these situations, and it is one we reaffirm today.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-9\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b926-10\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-11\">Because the Commission devoted considerable energy to justifying its view of the proper relationship between court and agency, a few words on the subject are in order here. The Commission repeatedly referred to <em>WEFM </em>as representing the \u201cpolicy\u201d of the Court of Appeals, and contrasted it unfavorably with the \u201cpolicy\u201d of the Commission. It called upon this court, as its so-called \u201cpartner\u201d in the regulatory process, to step back and recognize that its \u201cpolicy\u201d is superior to our own.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-12\">We should have thought that <em>WEFM </em>represents, not a <em>policy, </em>but rather the <em>law </em>of the land as enacted by Congress and interpreted by the Court of Appeals, and as it is to be administered by the Commission. This court has neither the expertise nor the constitutional authority to make \u201cpolicy\u201d as that word is commonly understood. <em>See National Broadcasting Co. v. United States, </em>319 U.S. 190, 224, 63 S.Ct. 997, 87 L.Ed. 1344 (1943); <em>Action for Children\u2019s Television v. FCC, </em>183 U.S.App.D.C. 437, 460-61, 564 F.2d 458, 481-82 (1977); <em>WEFM, supra, </em>165 U.S.App.D.C. at 206-07, 506 F.2d at 267-68. That role is reserved to the Congress, and, within the bounds of delegated authority, to the Commission. But in matters of interpreting the \u201claw\u201d the final say is constitutionally committed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"855\">*855</page-number>to the judiciary. <em>See International Brotherhood of Teamsters v. Daniel, </em>439 U.S. 551, 99 S.Ct. 790, 800 &amp; n.20, 58 L.Ed.2d 808 (1979); <em>SEC v. Sloan, </em>436 U.S. 103, 118-19, 98 S.Ct. 1702, 56 L.Ed.2d 148 (1978). Although the distinction between law and policy is never clearcut, it is nonetheless a touchstone of the proper relation between court and agency that we ignore at our peril.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-4\"><em>WEFM </em>was an interpretation of a statute applicable to an adjudicatory proceeding and, to this extent, was a decision in which the judicial word is final. That decision was based on an interpretation of the Communications Act. Moreover, although we did not explicitly address the constitutional implications of our decision, the constitutional issue was commented upon extensively by Chief Judge Bazelon in his opinion concurring in the result. Suffice it to say that we found no constitutional impediment to the decision as we understood it. As to these constitutional and statutory issues, it was the Commission\u2019s obligation to accept and carry out in good faith its legal duties as interpreted by this court.<footnotemark>51</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b927-8\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-9\">Our legal judgments in the earlier cases, however, were grounded in certain factual premises, namely, that there is, in the traditional sense, no free market in radio broadcasting and that in certain circumstances, when there are persuasive indications that market allocation has broken down, the Commission had been given a useful role by Congress to play in ensuring that the benefits of radio accrue to all the people, not simply those favored by advertisers. The Commission, in its staff study appended to the <em>Policy Statement, </em>challenged those empirical assumptions. To the extent that the Commission was not questioning this court\u2019s legal judgment, but was attempting to demonstrate that faulty factual premises underlay that judgment, we agree that it was within its competence as an agency better equipped to develop legislative-type facts than is this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"856\">*856</page-number>As we have noted, however, the Commission\u2019s use of the staff study was infected with the serious flaw that it never even divulged the existence of the study, much less gave the participants the opportunity to comment thereon, before issuing its <em>Policy Statement. </em>This procedural unfairness, coupled with the substantive uncertainty flowing from the lack of adequate adversarial testing during the comment period, is enough to make us view skeptically the Commission\u2019s use of the study. But even if we were to accept the study on its own terms, we would not be persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-4\">The study consisted of two parts. In the first, the Commission staff compiled a chart showing which of 18 format types were available in the 25 largest radio markets. From this, the Commission argued that an adequate degree of diversity was currently being achieved by market forces. Second, the staff performed a statistical analysis of the relationship between the format type programmed by a station and its audience share as a rough measure of the degree to which stations programing the \u201csame\u201d format are considered by consumers to be close substitutes for one another. The staff found that the variation of audience shares within a given format was nearly as great as the variation among formats, and concluded that stations programing the same format were not necessarily close substitutes for one another. From this the Commission argued that it was not true, as we had supposed in <em>WEFM, </em>that abandonment of a unique format in favor of a format already present in the service area strongly indicated a loss in overall diversity.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-5\">The first part of the study, in our view, is completely consistent with <em>WEFM. </em>That case recognized that market allocation is generally an adequate guarantor of format diversity; it requires the Commission to step in only when there are persuasive indications that market allocation has failed in a particular case. <em>WEFM, </em>we repeat, was aimed not at the probable majority of cases in which the market operates adequately, but as those perhaps infrequent cases in which it has not done the job. The study does not show that the market functions adequately in every instance.<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> Indeed, the Commission admits that market allocation is an imperfect reflection of audience preferences.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-8\">The second part of the staff study challenged the proposition that the Commission can \u2014 and must if it is to be faithful to the Act it administers \u2014 sometimes do a better job than the imperfect market. The Commission, as we have noted, viewed <em>WEFM </em>as mandating a system of pervasive governmental format allocation antithetical to the free market. If this were the meaning of <em>WEFM, </em>we would certainly agree that it could not improve on market allocation. But when it is recognized that <em>WEFM </em>contemplates governmental action as a supplement, not a substitute, for the market, and when attention is focused on cases of prima facie market breakdown, as in the <em>Atlanta </em>case, it seems far more likely that the Commission could usefully play a limited corrective role.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-9\">Nor are we convinced by the study\u2019s statistical analysis. It is not surprising that one station, by dint of stronger signal, more pleasing announcers, better tempo, superior technical quality or other factors, should gain a much greater market share than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"857\">*857</page-number>another station programing the same format in the service area. What would be surprising, however, is if listeners, deprived of their favorite station, were indifferent as to whether they switched to another station programing the same format or to a different format altogether. The common sense of it is that most lovers of disco will switch to another disco station in preference to classical, all-news, country and western or the like. When a unique format is abandoned, those loyal to that format have no adequate substitute in the service area; when a non-unique format is eliminated, its listeners will generally have an adequate substitute in other stations programing the same format.<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> For this reason abandonment of a unique entertainment format raises the special public interest issue treated by our format cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-5\">Once again the court confronts a problem deriving, in the last analysis, from the common and undivided ownership of the airwaves by all of the people. In <em>Office of Communication of United Church of Christ v. FCC, </em>123 U.S.App.D.C. 328, 359 F.2d 994 (1966) and <em>Office of Communication of United Church of Christ v. FCC, </em>138 U.S. App.D.C. 112, 425 F.2d 543 (1969), this court, in two vigorous opinions by Judge (now Chief Justice) Burger, dealt with a Commission reading of the Act that denied standing to oppose license renewal to all except competing licensees claiming either electrical or economic interference. The first such opinion, at the instance of members of the listening public who wished to be heard on the asserted inadequacies of the licensee\u2019s programing, demolished that incredibly restrictive interpretation of the Act\u2019s \u201cpublic interest, convenience, and necessity\u201d standard. The second opinion overturned a rejection of the petition to deny after a hearing and decision on remand which it characterized as positively hostile to the complainants.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-7\">In <em>United Church of Christ, </em>as here, the Commission asserted all manner of difficulties with the interpretation of the statute pressed upon it by the protestants, including notably severe administrative burdens hampering the discharge of its regulatory responsibilities, if objections to format abandonment were required to be entertained and, where substantial, explored in evidentiary hearings. The Commission\u2019s <em>Policy Statement </em>in issue here is strongly reminiscent of the attitude displayed by it in <em>United Church of Christ </em>The Commission, despite its parade of horribles in that case, has obviously survived.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-8\">In <em>WEFM </em>the court was at considerable pains to make clear that it was speaking solely in the context of the current regulatory scheme laid down by Congress. The result reached, we said,<footnotemark>54</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"At4\">cannot be otherwise when it is remembered that the radio channels are priceless properties in limited supply, owned by all of the people but for the use of which the licensees pay nothing. If the marketplace alone is to determine programming format, then different tastes among the totality of the owners may go ungratified.

The Commission\u2019s reliance on cases beginning with <em>Banzhaf v. FCC, </em>132 U.S.App.D.C. 14, 405 F.2d 1082 (1968), <em>cert. denied, </em>396 U.S. 842, 90 S.Ct. 50, 24 L.Ed.2d 93 (1969), is misplaced. In <em>Banzhaf </em>we affirmed the Commission\u2019s determination that cigarette commercials raised controversial issues of public importance and thus gave rise to fairness doctrine obligations for broadcasters who ran them. In subsequent cases this court followed the <em>Banzhaf </em>holding with respect to other types of product advertising. <em>Retail Store Employees Union v. FCC, </em>141 U.S.App.D.C. 94, 436 F.2d 248 (1970); Friends of <em>the Earth v. FCC, </em>146 U.S.App.D.C. 88, 449 F.2d 1164 (1971). The Commission then instituted a general reexamination of the fairness doctrine and concluded that it would no longer apply it to product advertising. Fairness Report, 48 F.C.C.2d 1, 24 (1970). We affirmed the change of policy. <em>National Citizens Comm. for Broadcasting v. FCC, </em>186 U.S. App.D.C. 102, 567 F.2d 1095 (1977), <em>cert. denied, </em>436 U.S. 926, 98 S.Ct. 2820, 56 L.Ed.2d 769 (1978). The Commission argues that we should also permit it to change its mind in the present case and cease enforcing the format decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-6\">There is, however, an important difference between when (1) we <em>uphold </em>an agency\u2019s interpretation of its governing statute and then review its contrary interpretation; and (2) we <em>reject </em>an agency\u2019s interpretation of its governing statute and then review its reaffirmation of its original interpretation. Because of the deference owed the Commission\u2019s construction of the Communications Act, <em>Columbia Broadcasting Sys., Inc. v. Democratic Nat\u2019l Comm., </em>412 U.S. 94, 121-22, 93 S.Ct. 2080, 36 L.Ed.2d 772 (1973); <em>Red Lion Broadcasting Co. v. FCC, </em>395 U.S. 367, 381, 89 S.Ct. 1794, 23 L.Ed.2d 371 (1969), there is a fairly wide range of interpretations we would uphold on judicial review. In the product commercial cases, both the Commission\u2019s positions fell within this range and we Were therefore able to uphold both. In the format cases, by contrast, we found from the start that the Commission\u2019s interpretation of the Act could not be sustained even when all due deference was given that construction. There is no reason for us to pay any greater deference to the Commission when it makes the same arguments in a subsequent proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-11\">Perhaps recognizing the force of this objection, the Commission attempts to place itself in the first category described above rather than the second: it implies that it originally agreed with the holdings of the format cases and only later determined to change its mind. This argument, however, is belied by the Commission\u2019s history of at least passive resistance to the format decisions in the name of licensee freedom. <em>See </em>notes 31-32 and accompanying text <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"52\">\n<p id=\"b928-6\">. It could be argued, in fact, that by examining only the nation\u2019s 25 largest radio markets (which presumably display the greatest degree of diversity) the staff presented a distorted picture of the extent of diversity in the country as a whole. We might also note that even in these major markets important formats are shown as unavailable in the listening area. For example, apparently no classical music service is provided in 7 of the 25 markets. <em>See </em>60 F.C.C.2d at 875-79. Conversely, the study shows a high degree of format duplication in the markets studied.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-10\">It is a useful corrective to focus, not on the broad range of cases in which the market functions accurately, but on those infrequent cases in which it appears that it has failed to promote diversity and that the Commission could remedy the defect. One need only think of the <em>Atlanta </em>case. Although 16% of the listeners preferred classical music, what was allegedly the only classical format was being abandoned in favor of music which was already programed by several of the 20 stations in the service area. In such a situation, it is evident that market forces may not be serving the public interest.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"53\">\n<p id=\"b929-6\">.

The bill presently given the best change of passage, H.R.3333, <em>supra </em>note 55, could well be read to make the present controversy moot. This would grant radio licenses for an indefinite period (i. e., in perpetuity), <em>id. </em>\u00a7 471(a), and would allocate new or revoked radio licenses among competing applicants by a lottery system, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 415(d).

The Commission\u2019s failure to make public the staff study that proved so central to its final decision violates fundamental rulemaking principles.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As the majority opinion documents,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the FCC exhibited an almost cavalier disregard for the public\u2019s right to comment on the critical data and methodology supporting the Commission\u2019s finding that \u201cmarket forces had provided a significant even if not perfect amount of diversity.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> This conclusion in turn is a vital link in the Commission\u2019s reasoning underlying its adoption of the <em>Policy Statement. </em>I believe therefore that the record must be reopened to permit meaningful public participation in the Commission\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-12\">Because the Commission\u2019s procedural unfairness requires vacating the rule, I would not reach the merits of the FCC\u2019s interpretation of the public interest standard as applied to the abandonment of a so-called distinctive or unique format. But since the majority has precluded the FCC from adopting a rule contrary to the decision in <em>WEFM, </em>I feel compelled to note my agreement with much of Judge Tamm\u2019s thoughtful dissent. Implementing the public interest standard calls for a strong dose of policy judgment, a responsibility entrusted by Congress to the FCC.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Yet the majority <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"859\">*859</page-number>virtually confines the FCC to a spectator\u2019s role in formulating policies that will promote and preserve diversity while minimizing the hazards of government intrusion into the content of broadcasting.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-5\">Even apart from this unwillingness to give appropriate deference to the Commission\u2019s judgment, I would remain troubled by the route taken by the majority. As I explained at some length in <em>WEFM,</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark><em> </em>regulation of entertainment formats is not content neutral. The regulator is inevitably led to favor some forms of expression over others.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The majority acknowledges the \u201csensitive First Amendment implications\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> of government oversight of format choice, but fails to grapple seriously with the constitutional implications of its decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-6\">I do not contend that there is a simple resolution to the conflict between fostering diversity, on the one hand, and protecting the media from chilling government interference on the other. The concerns I expressed in <em>WEFM </em>continue to plague efforts to regulate the airwaves in the public interest. Perhaps Congress will exercise its prerogative to cut the Gordian knot and free the choice of format from the bondage of government regulation.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Alternatively, the dawning technological revolution may eliminate this dilemma, by opening up an unprecedented number of accessible outlets for speech.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> For the time being, however, the responsibility for reconciling these interests is lodged with the FCC and, to a limited extent, the courts. The record of fifty years of broadcast regulation suggests that the FCC\u2019s affirmative efforts to promote diversity have not only failed to achieve that goal, but have entangled the Commission and the courts in perilous government oversight of the content of expression. I cannot so easily reject the FCC\u2019s decision to turn away from this troubling experience and to cast its lot with the marketplace.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b930-15\">. \u201cIt is not consonant with the purpose of a rulemaking proceeding to promulgate rules on the basis of . data that, [in] critical degree, is known only to the agency.\u201d <em>Portland Cement Ass\u2019n v.

The majority\u2019s decision, I fear, usurps the proper role of the Federal Communications Commission (Commission) in the formulation of communications policy. In my view, the Commission\u2019s determination that application of <em>Citizens Committee to Save WEFM v. FCC (WEFM), </em>165 U.S.App.D.C. 185, 506 F.2d 246 (1974) (en banc), will not measurably increase diversity of entertainment formats is neither arbitrary nor capricious. Although I understand the frustration of reexamining an issue purportedly resolved, I believe that the much touted agency-court partnership is well served by continuing dialogue between administrator and judge. I am persuaded that the Commission, which Congress has entrusted with the duty to regulate broadcasting in the public interest, has advanced a reasoned position which this court should uphold.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-18\">In <em>WEFM, </em>we decided that when an application to transfer a radio license involves a change in format, the Commission must determine whether the assignor\u2019s format is unique and financially viable.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> If so, the Commission, when faced with substantial questions of fact and significant public opposition to the transfer, must conduct a hearing to discern whether loss of the format is in the public interest before acting upon the application.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b933-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"861\">*861</page-number>The <em>WEFM </em>court based the hearing requirement on the \u201cpublic interest in a diversity of broadcast entertainment formats.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The court warned that format diversity would not necessarily result from the unregulated play of market forces because broadcasters derive revenue from the sale of time to advertisers, not from the sale of programming to listeners. A station with a larger audience may sell more advertising time, and at higher rates, than a station with fewer listeners. A station with a smaller but more demographically attractive audience may, however, sell as much or more time as the station with greater numbers of listeners. The court feared that the effect of demographics on the radio market would allow listeners with desirable demographic characteristics \u2014 typically eighteen-to thirty-year-olds with discretionary income \u2014 to exercise a disproportionate influence upon broadcast decisionmakers who choose formats. Because formats preferred by fewer younger people might prove financially more attractive than formats preferred by a greater number of older or lower income listeners, the court concluded that regulation was necessary to insure diversity. The court\u2019s reasoning implicitly suggests that regulation is unnecessary if the radio market reflects the desires of the greatest numbers of listeners.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-13\">The Commission responded to <em>WEFM </em>by instituting a proceeding designed to develop methods for implementing the court\u2019s ruling.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> After reviewing comments of both broadcasters and public interest representatives, the Commission concluded that use of the <em>WEFM </em>doctrine would not demonstrably further the public interest.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b933-14\">The Commission did not premise its decision upon a rejection of the court\u2019s observation that the presence of demographic considerations might increase the influence of certain listeners.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Rather, the Commission first contended that the radio market produces diversity of formats. In support, the Commission presented a study of formats aired in major cities demonstrating \u201can almost bewildering array of diversity.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b933-15\">Second, the Commission argued that administrative intervention in the format selection process could not be shown to further the public interest.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The Commission contended that stations within a given format are not interchangeable to their respective audiences.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Simply stated, listen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"862\">*862</page-number>ers of a particular station within a format category may not be equally willing to listen to any station within the same format category. The Commission\u2019s assumption suggests that, for example, in a two-station market consisting of a top 40 format and a classical format, a second top 40 station might command a greater audience than the unique classical station.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b934-4\">The majority does not dispute the possibility that more listeners may prefer a second top 40 station to a unique classical format. Rather, it suggests that retention of the classical format might be in the public interest because the desires of those preferring the second top 40 station can be easily satisfied by the first top 40 station. Classical tastes, to the contrary, would be less likely satisfied by a top 40 format. The majority explains:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b934-5\">When a unique format is abandoned, those loyal to that format have no adequate substitute in the service area; when a non-unique format is eliminated, its listeners will generally have an adequate substitute in other stations programing the same format. For this reason abandonment of a unique entertainment format raises the special public interest issue by our format cases.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"A9_\">Thus, the majority introduces a novel doctrine that calculates the public interest without necessary reference to the aural desires of the greatest number of listeners. The majority\u2019s approach is fraught with difficulties.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-6\">First, <em>WEFM </em>does not require use of the \u201csubstitution\u201d theory. The <em>WEFM </em>court noted that the accuracy of listener preferences in the radio marketplace might be distorted by advertisers\u2019 quests for demographically desirable audiences. Any demographic effect on the market, however, is cured if the Commission can ascertain the numbers of people that desire different formats. I harbor serious doubts that regulation based on direct listener \u201cvotes\u201d is practicable; but even if it is, the majority, in an effort to justify regulation that may preserve a format favored by fewer listeners than would prefer a changed format, advances the \u201csubstitution\u201d principle. Although this theory marks a substantial departure from the reasoning of <em>WEFM, </em>the majority offers no independent support for the principle.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-9\">Second, use of the \u201csubstitution\u201d theory assumes that \u201cunique\u201d formats can be adequately distinguished from \u201cnon-unique\u201d formats. Former Commissioner Glen O. Robinson, in his concurring statement in <em>Notice of Inquiry, </em>57 F.C.C.2d at 594-95, emphasized the enormity of this task:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b934-10\">What makes one format unique makes all formats unique. If subjectivity is to be an important determinant of what makes a format \u201cunique\u201d (or, in other terms, what makes it a net contributor to diversity), how are we to avoid the fact that even with respect to formats which objectively seem identical, people \u2014 radio listeners \u2014 can and do make distinctions. For example, in most large markets there are a number of middle-of-the-road formats which seem identical on any objective or quantifiable basis; yet they are far from interchangeable to their respective audiences. Indeed, if people did not distinguish among these stations, there would be no reason for them to co-exist\u2014 and little economic likelihood that they would. Questions of pacing and style, the personalities of on-the-air talent (both individually and in combination with one another) all contribute to those fugitive values that radio people call a station\u2019s \u201csound\u201d and that citizens\u2019 groups (and, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"863\">*863</page-number>alas, appellate judges) call format. It follows, therefore, that by the subjective standards that the Court seems to embrace, any format is unique; from which it follows, all must be preserved. At that thought the mind swims and the heart sinks. (Footnotes omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b935-5\">The majority does not explicitly concede the difficulty of classifying formats according to listener preference. Nevertheless, it suggests that the Commission may dispense with the requirement that an endangered format be demonstrably \u201cunique\u201d for purposes of ordering a hearing.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Although the majority\u2019s concession neatly sidesteps the difficulty of defining a \u201cunique\u201d format at the pre-hearing stage, it does nothing to ease the Commission\u2019s task once a hearing is held.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-6\">Third, the \u201csubstitution\u201d theory assumes that it is possible for a federal regulatory agency to measure listener preferences in entertainment formats. I would have thought that the best judge of the most desirable entertainment formats is the listening audience itself. When sufficient numbers of top 40 listeners switch channels to patronize another station, which for purposes of federal regulation is also classified as top 40, they must want to hear a \u201csound\u201d not previously offered. If consumers purchased radio programming, classical listeners could express a greater intensity of preference simply by paying more than top 40 listeners. Alternatively, if the top 40 listeners intensely preferred a second top 40 station, they could respond by paying even more. Because radio broadcasting is a \u201czero price\u201d good,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> however, consumers cannot register their intensity of preference through a price system. \u201cSubstitution\u201d as used by the majority is merely a crude device meant to measure the intensity of listener preference.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-12\">The \u201csubstitution\u201d theory runs afoul of the familiar economic principle that it is either impossible or extremely difficult to compare the intensity of preference of different persons.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The range of audience preferences within the same format, for example, suggests that the Commission would be hard pressed to determine how much and how many listeners would prefer a variation of a pre-existing format to a unique format. Given the many aspects of a specific station\u2019s \u201csound,\u201d it is difficult to measure the amount or the depth of audience acceptance of a changed format without allowing broadcast of the new format \u2014 a solution which eradicates the controversy.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-13\">Finally, the majority\u2019s \u201csubstitution\u201d theory assumes that the Commission will be able to balance number of listeners against intensity of format preference. Consider <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"864\">*864</page-number>the top 40/classical format hypothetical. If twenty percent of the listening audience would mildly prefer a second top 40 format and five percent would vigorously prefer retention of the classical format, does the size of one audience outweigh the intensity of preference of the other? The majority opinion offers no clue.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-4\">In sum, the majority\u2019s opinion presents an unjustified rebuttal to the Commission\u2019s conclusion that the public interest may not be discernibly furthered by implementation of the <em>WEFM </em>doctrine. The majority has not explained how to decide whether a specific format is unique, how to measure the number of listeners who favor a changed format, or how to compare the intensity of preference between listeners who desire retention of a unique format and those who prefer a variation of a pre-existing format. Finally, the majority has failed to identify the principle within the Communications Act that mandates regulation favoring the interests of fewer listeners over the interests of more listeners.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-5\">I am also troubled by another aspect of the majority opinion. The majority notes that petitioners allege that they did not have an adequate opportunity to comment on two studies relied upon by the Commission. The majority explicitly declines to \u201cdecide whether the failure to obtain public comment on the study is itself of sufficient gravity to warrant rejection of the <em>Policy </em>Statement,\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> although it says that this \u201cprocedural unfairness, coupled with the substantive uncertainty flowing from the lack of adequate adversarial testing during the comment period, is enough to make us view skeptically the Commission\u2019s use of the study.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> On the assumption that the former statement clearly asserts that the majority opinion does not rest upon a procedural ground, I have directed the thrust of these dissenting remarks to the substantive validity of the Commission\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-15\">I note in passing, however, that the two statements taken together may be read as suggesting that the alleged procedural unfairness was not serious enough to require a remand to the agency, yet was serious enough to allow the majority to subject the agency to unusually strict scrutiny. In my view, if the majority believes that the Commission has committed procedural error sufficient to alter the normal standard of review of administrative decisions, then a remand to the Commission is proper.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> A remand would afford the petitioners greater opportunity to comment upon the studies, offer the Commission the opportunity to build a better record for review, and allow this court to meet the Commission\u2019s contentions head on.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-16\">More important than the specifics of the current debate, is the lack of deference the majority accords the Commission\u2019s assessment of market conditions. Although the majority acknowledges the expertise of the Commission to challenge the factual premises that underly the <em>WEFM </em>decision,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> it mounts untested assumption upon untested assumption to create a theory of regulation that may bear little resemblance to the actual functioning of the broadcast market. Only the Commission, equipped with investigatory tools and a well of experience, may predict in the first instance the behavior of listeners and broadcasters. The majority has simply substituted its views for the Commission\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-17\">The Supreme Court has often reminded this court of the appropriate relationship between administrative agency and reviewing court. Only last year, the Court, reversing our finding that the Commission had acted improperly in \u201cgrandfathering\u201d certain newspaper-broadcast station combi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"865\">*865</page-number>nations, noted that the Commission\u2019s decision to adopt a general policy of prospective divestiture was primarily judgmental or predictive. \u201cIn such circumstances, complete factual support in the record for the Commission\u2019s judgment or prediction is not possible or required; \u2018a forecast of the direction in which future public interest lies necessarily involves deductions based on the expert knowledge of the agency.\u2019 \u201d <em>FCC v. National Citizens Committee for Broadcasting, </em>436 U.S. 775, 814, 98 S.Ct. 2096, 2122, 56 L.Ed.2d 697 (1978) (quoting <em>FPC v. Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Corp., </em>365 U.S. 1, 29, 81 S.Ct. 435, 450 5 L.Ed.2d 377 (1961)). In the present case, the majority disregards the Commission\u2019s expert knowledge and, in so doing, violates the mandate of <em>FCC </em>v. <em>National Citizens Committee for Broadcasting.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b937-6\">The majority has lost sight of our role as a reviewing court whose proper function is to uphold an agency\u2019s reasonable judgment. The Commission\u2019s determination that use of the <em>WEFM </em>doctrine will not further the public interest is well within the parameters of reason. Faced with a conflict between judicial and administrative policies,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> I believe we are obliged to uphold the Commission. The court\u2019s decision today, a reversal based on unverified factual assumptions about listener preferences and behavior, extends judicial review of administrative poli-cymaking processes beyond its permissible bounds.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b932-20\">.

Second, the Commission thought that format regulation would chill broadcaster\u2019s first amendment rights. <em>Id. </em>Although I agree that the first amendment concerns are substantial, <em>see Citizens Comm. to Save WEFM, </em>165 U.S. App.D.C. at 207, 506 F.2d at 268 (Bazelon, C.

That is, two different formats which attract audiences of equal size may not be of equal value. Preferences expressed by the audience of one format may be much stronger than preferences for the other, in which case the former should be the more valuable. In order to ascertain which format is the more valuable, one would have to know the intensity of demand for each. Again, there exists no acceptable, reliable way of measuring aspects of these consumer preferences because consumers are not required to pay for the opportunity to listen to radio.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b935-15\"><em>Policy Statement, </em>60 F.C.C.2d at 873; <em>see </em>Bruce M.
