The Bank asserted that a-knowingly false financial statement was given to the Bank when the Bardwells obtained a loan. The bankruptcy court found the statement false but dismissed the Bank\u2019s objection as to Mrs. Bardwell, because it also found that Mrs. Bardwell believed the financial statement to be true and correct when she executed it, and that she did not act with such reckless indifference to the facts as to warrant a finding that she acted fraudulently or with an intent to deceive. The Bank appeals. The district court\u2019s decision that the bankruptcy court\u2019s finding of fact as to Mrs. Bardwell was not clearly erroneous is affirmed. The Bank\u2019s objection to Mr. Bard-well\u2019s discharge is not raised on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-17\">The Bank argues that an intent to deceive the Bank must be imputed to the bankrupt, Rachel Hudgins Bardwell, because her execution of the financial statement in reliance on the accuracy of information furnished by her husband demonstrates reckless indifference to the facts stated therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-18\">At trial, Mrs. Bardwell testified that before signing the financial statement, she \u201cglanced at it briefly,\u201d and relied on her husband, an attorney, for the truth and correctness of the statement he had prepared. She admitted that two notes owing to her mother and totaling $24,250 had been omitted from the statement. She did not sign one of the notes until after the statement was made, though her husband had previously signed it, and did not remember when she first became aware of the note. She stated she had forgotten the other note payable to her mother because in a letter received from her stepfather shortly before the financial statement was completed, he enclosed a copy of a $30,000 note, but not the omitted note.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-19\">On appeal from the bankruptcy court, the district court applied the correct rules of law. Obtaining credit by a materially false financial statement will prevent bankruptcy discharge if the bankrupt either had actual knowledge of the falsity of the statement or demonstrated reckless indifference to the accuracy of the facts stated therein. <em>Gardner v. American Century </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number><em>Mortgage Investors, </em>577 F.2d 928 (5th Cir. 1978) (discharge of bankrupt); <em>In re Houtman, </em>568 F.2d 651 (9th Cir. 1978) (discharge of debt); <em>see </em>Bankruptcy Act \u00a7\u00a7 14(c)(3), 17(a)(2), 11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 32(c)(3), 35(a)(2) (current versions at 11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 727(a)(4), 523(a)(2)).</p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\">The bankruptcy court\u2019s factual finding must be affirmed unless clearly erroneous. <em>Gardner v. American Century Mortgage Investors, </em>577 F.2d at 929. The test for the district court, as well as for this Court, is not whether a different conclusion from the evidence would be appropriate, but whether there is sufficient evidence in the record to prevent clear error in the trial judge\u2019s findings. The testimony of Mrs. Bardwell here recounted, together with the absence of any other evidence against her, insulates the bankruptcy court\u2019s finding against reversal on review.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">The cases relied on by the Bank are distinguishable. In <em>David v. Annapolis Banking &amp; Trust Co., </em>209 F.2d 343 (4th Cir. 1953), the bankrupt completed her personal financial statement in accordance with her husband\u2019s directions and grossly misstated a variety of assets and liabilities. The court affirmed the denial of her discharge, emphasizing that she had \u201cno reasonable ground to believe\u201d the truth of the statement. 209 F.2d at 344. <em>See also Morris Plan Industrial Bank v. Lassman, </em>116 F.2d 473 (2d Cir. 1940) (bankrupt who merely guesses at amount of his liabilities acts with intent to deceive); <em>Woolen Corp. of America v. Gitnig, </em>33 F.2d 259 (3d Cir. 1929) (bankrupts who accept their father\u2019s dictation of partnership asset and liability figures without reference to books at hand act with reckless indifference).</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\"><em>In re Santos, </em>211 F.2d 887 (7th Cir. 1954), is similarly distinguishable. The illiterate bankrupt who relied on his wife\u2019s completion of a false financial statement was found to have acted with reckless indifference. The evidence indicated, however, that he \u201chad considerable experience\u201d with such matters, that \u201chis wife thought he knew the statement was false,\u201d and that a loan officer had questioned him about and reviewed with him the listings in the statement. 211 F.2d at 889.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
