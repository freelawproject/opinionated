BROWN, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b1408-12\">Simon Angelle was formerly engaged in-the business of constructing homes and selling lumber and building supplies. The forces of spiraling inflation and rainy weather made it increasingly difficult for Angelle to carry out his home building contracts, so on February 14, 1974, he filed a voluntary petition of bankruptcy. To use a shop-worn legalism, he sought a \u201cfresh start.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1408-13\">Quite predictably, the prospective home owners were irate. Five parties, all of whom had advanced considerable funds and were left with partially completed homes, filed objections to discharge of their claims against Angelle. All of these parties relied on \u00a7 17a(4) of the Bankruptcy Act, 11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 35(a)(4), which forbids discharge of debts \u201ccreated by [the bankrupt\u2019s] fraud, embezzlement, misappropriation or defalcation while acting ... in any fiduciary capacity.\u201d And at least some of the parties relied on \u00a7 17a(2) of the Act, 11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 35(a)(2), which forbids discharge when the bankrupt \u201cobtain[ed] money or property under false pretenses or representations,\u201d and on \u00a7 17a(8) of the Act, 11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 35(a)(8), which forbids discharge when the bankrupt\u2019s liabilities are \u201cfor willful and malicious injuries to the person or property of another\u201d other than conversion as excepted under [\u00a7 17a(2)].<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1408-16\">Three of the five cases were consolidated for hearing by Bankruptcy Judge Alex An-drus, who found the three debts non-dis-chargeable. The other two cases were consolidated for hearing by Bankruptcy Judge Leroy Smallenberger, who found the two debts dischargeable. All five cases were appealed to the District Court. Angelle appealed Judge Andrus\u2019s decisions and the losing parties before Judge Smallenberger appealed those two decisions. The five cases were consolidated at the District Court level. The District Court found that Angelle had misappropriated funds while acting in a fiduciary capacity and held that none of the five debts were dischargeable. Without reaching the \u00a7 17a(2) and \u00a7 17a(8) questions, it reversed the judgments by Judge Smallenberger and affirmed the judgments by Judge Andrus. <em>Reed v. An-gelle (In Re Angelle), </em>425 F.Supp. 823 (W.D.La.1977). Angelle then appealed to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1408-17\">We hold that although Angelle may have misappropriated funds, he was not acting in a fiduciary capacity as required by \u00a7 17a(4). Accordingly, we reverse the decision of the District Court, but remand for consideration of the \u00a7 17a(2) and (8) issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b1408-18\">\n<em>I. Background: The Facts And Proceedings Below</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1408-19\">The circumstances of the five suits seeking to prevent discharge of the claims against Angelle are in all essential respects the same. The creditors, Roy Lee Berger-on, Dr. Kenneth P. Reed, Joseph Trahan, Joseph and Rita Sylvester, and Moses Dyes, each entered into a contract with Angelle <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1337\">*1337</page-number>for the construction of a home. Each of them advanced funds to Angelle to be used for the construction of his particular home. At the time Angelle declared bankruptcy, none of the five homes had been completed. All of the creditors were forced to expend amounts in excess of their contract price to complete their homes.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1409-5\">Angelle admits that he had only one bank account, made all deposits into that account, and made no effort to segregate funds advanced by the individual parties who contracted for the construction of homes. He also admits that he did not always apply funds advanced by a particular contracting party to that party\u2019s construction job, frequently using such funds to pay his general business debts. However, he contends that he was not acting in a fiduciary capacity. Moreover, he does not concede that he made any false representations or otherwise acted maliciously or in bad faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b1409-6\">Bankruptcy Judge Andrus found that in the three cases before him, Angelle\u2019s debts were nondischargeable. He based his decision on three alternative grounds. First, relying on \u00a7 17a(4), he held that Angelle had misappropriated funds while acting in a fiduciary capacity. Second, relying on \u00a7 17a(2), he held that Angelle had obtained advances from the contracting parties under false pretenses. Finally, relying on \u00a7 17a(8), he held that Angelle\u2019s liabilities were created through willful and malicious misappropriation of the funds advanced by the creditors, causing these parties financial injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b1409-12\">Bankruptcy Judge Smallenberger, on the other hand, in the two cases before him, found the debts dischargeable. In two extremely vague\u2014and identically reasoned\u2014 opinions, Judge Smallenberger held that under Louisiana jurisprudence, Angelle\u2019s debts were dischargeable even though Angelle \u201ccomingle[d] funds on numerous jobs and fail[ed] to extend the exact equivalent of money received from a particular job for that job.\u201d In holding the debts dischargeable, Judge Smallenberger did not explicitly state whether he had even considered \u00a7 17a(2), (4), or (8).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1409-13\">On appeal, the District Court found that in all five cases Angelle had misappropriated funds while acting in a fiduciary capacity. Since Angelle virtually conceded that he had misappropriated funds, the District Court focused almost exclusively on whether Angelle was a fiduciary. The Court first discussed a Louisiana criminal law, LSA\u2014R.S. 14:202,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> which makes it a criminal offense for a contractor to use funds advanced by a contracting party for any purpose other than material and labor for the advancing party\u2019s project. This law suggested to the District Court that Angelle, when accepting advances from the contract<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1338\">*1338</page-number>ing parties, occupied a position of trust and confidence.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1410-4\">The Court then discussed the meaning of \u201cfiduciary.\u201d It quoted from an Eighth Circuit case,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> which defined a fiduciary relationship as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1410-5\">\u201cA relation subsisting between two persons in regard to a business, contract, or piece of property, ... of such a character that each must repose trust and confidence in the other and must exercise a corresponding degree of fairness and good faith. Out of such a relation, the law raises the rule that neither party may take selfish advantage of his trust, or deal with the subject matter of the trust in such a way as to benefit himself or prejudice the other except in the exercise of the utmost good faith and with the full knowledge and consent of that other.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1410-6\">425 F.Supp. at 826, <em>quoting Farrow v. Der-mott Drainage Dist., </em>139 F.2d 800, 805 (8th Cir. 1944).</p>\n<p id=\"b1410-7\">On the basis of this broad definition of fiduciary and the Louisiana criminal statute, the District Court held that all five debts were not dischargeable under \u00a7 17a(4). The issue before us is whether the District Court correctly determined that Angelle was a fiduciary for purposes of \u00a7 17a(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b1410-8\">\n<em>II. Was Angelle A Fiduciary?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1410-9\">Since this Circuit has not previously discussed the meaning of fiduciary under \u00a7 17a(4), and since various courts have taken somewhat different views on the issue, some background discussion is essential.</p>\n<p id=\"b1410-10\">\n<em>A. Principles Gleaned From Prior Cases</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1410-11\">The Bankruptcy Act of 1841 contained a provision similar to \u00a7 17a(4). In 1844, the Supreme Court considered whether a factor who sold property belonging to his principal and failed to pay the principal the proceeds owed him a debt created in a fiduciary capacity. The Court held that a factor was not a fiduciary and made clear that under the Bankruptcy Act, the concept of fiduciary should be narrowly defined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1410-15\">In almost all the commercial transactions of the country, confidence is reposed in the punctuality and integrity of the debtor, and a violation of these is, in a commercial sense, a disregard of a trust. But this is not the relation spoken of in the [Bankruptcy Act]. . . . <em>The act speaks of technical trusts, and not those which the law implies from the contract. </em>A factor is not, therefore, within the act.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1410-17\"><em>Chapman </em>v. <em>Forsyth, </em>2 U.S. (How.) 202, 207, 11 L.Ed. 236, 238 (1844) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1410-18\">Subsequently, the Supreme Court refined and narrowed the concept of fiduciary articulated in <em>Chapman. </em>The Court made clear that the technical trust required by <em>Chapman </em>must exist prior to the act creating the debt and without reference to that act. See <em>Upshur v. Briscoe, </em>138 U.S. 365, 378, 11 S.Ct. 313, 317, 34 L.Ed. 931, 936 (1890). As the Court stated in <em>Davis v. Aetna Acceptance Co., </em>293 U.S. 328, 333, 55 S.Ct. 151, 154, 79 L.Ed.2d 393, 397-98 (1934) (emphasis added):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1410-20\">It is not enough that by the very act of wrongdoing out of which the contested debt arose, the bankrupt has become chargeable as a trustee ex maleficio. <em>He must have been a trustee before the wrong and without reference thereto. </em>In the words of Blatchford, J., \u201cThe language would seem to apply only to a debt created by a person who was already a fiduciary when the debt was created.\u201d <em>(Quoting Upshur v. Briscoe, supra.)</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1411-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1339\">*1339</page-number>Thus, a constructive trust is not sufficient to create a fiduciary relationship under the discharge provisions of the Bankruptcy Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1411-5\">These Supreme Court cases giving limited meaning to the term fiduciary are entirely consistent with \u2014 and indeed, serve to promote \u2014 the Bankruptcy Act\u2019s very purpose, which is \u201cto give the debtor a \u2018new opportunity in life and a clear field for future effort, unhampered by the pressure and discouragement of pre-existing debt.\u2019 \u201d <em>Lines v. Frederick, </em>400 U.S. 18, 19, 91 S.Ct. 113, 114, 27 L.Ed.2d 124, 127 (1970), <em>quoting Local Loan Co. v. Hunt, </em>292 U.S. 234, 244-45, 54 S.Ct. 695, 699, 78 L.Ed. 1230, 1235 (1933). The cases are also consistent with the well-established principle that exceptions to discharge should be limited to those clearly expressed in the statute. <em>Gleason v. Thaw, </em>236 U.S. 558, 562, 35 S.Ct. 287, 289, 59 L.Ed. 717, 719 (1915).</p>\n<p id=\"b1411-6\">In recent years, courts have extended the principles of <em>Chapman </em>and its progeny to situations where state statutes impose obligations on parties engaging in certain kinds of contracts. Since these cases reach conflicting results on similar facts, they are difficult to reconcile with one another.</p>\n<p id=\"b1411-7\">In May of 1976, the Tenth Circuit decided a case with facts very much like those involved here. The case, <em>Allen v. Romero (In re Romero), </em>535 F.2d 618 (10th Cir. 1976), also involved advances made to a building contractor that were not used by the contractor for the party\u2019s construction project. The Court held that the contractor acted in a fiduciary capacity. It based its decision on a New Mexico statute which provides for revocation of a contractor\u2019s license if funds advanced by the owner are not applied to the completion of the contract. The Court reasoned that this statute imposed a fiduciary duty on the contractor.</p>\n<p id=\"b1411-9\">Three months later, in <em>Schlecht v. Thornton (In Re </em>Thornton), 544 F.2d 1005 (9th Cir. 1976), the Ninth Circuit held that an employer who, in violation of a written agreement, made deductions from the wages of four employees and then failed to remit the funds to a vacation-savings trust fund, was not a fiduciary. The Court reached its conclusion even though an Oregon statute makes an employer\u2019s failure to remit such funds in violation of a written agreement unlawful.</p>\n<p id=\"b1411-10\">Then came the decision of the District Court for the Western District of New York in <em>Besroi Construction Corp. v. Kawczynski (In re Kawczynski), </em>442 F.Supp. 413 (W.D. N.Y.1977). In <em>Kawczynski, </em>the debtor (another home builder) also used funds advanced by contracting parties for business purposes other than for the projects of the contracting parties. The Court found the contractor to be a fiduciary based on the New York Lien Law, which requires a contractor to keep detailed records of advances and to segregate funds advanced, and makes it a criminal offense to use funds advanced for a particular project for other purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b1411-11\">Most recently, in <em>Devaney v. Dloogoff (In Re Dloogoff), </em>600 F.2d 166 (8th Cir. 1979), the Eighth Circuit held that a builder who received advances for the construction of a garage and failed to apply the advances to the debts created by labor and materials was not a fiduciary. The Court reached its decision despite the existence of a Nebraska law making it illegal for a contractor who receives advances to fail to apply the advances to claims of laborers and material-men having a right to file a lien.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1411-12\">While there are other relevant cases,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the cases discussed above present the various approaches utilized by the courts and dem<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1340\">*1340</page-number>onstrate adequately the confusion surrounding the definition of fiduciary under \u00a7 17a(4). We believe that to analyze the case before us, we must first attempt to make some sense out of these cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b1412-4\">At the outset, we wish to make clear that in our view, <em>Chapman </em>and its progeny need not be read so narrowly that a state can <em>never </em>make certain parties fiduciaries by imposing trust-like duties, such as segregating accounts, on those who enter into certain kinds of contracts. Under certain statutes, it is entirely fair to charge contractors with intent to create a trust simply because they have entered into a contract governed by a statute.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1412-5\">We have our doubts, however, that a statute which merely makes misappropriation of funds a crime \u2014 without, for example, requiring segregation of accounts\u2014 would be enough to charge the parties with an intent to create a trust. Fortunately, we need not resolve this issue, since we believe that the requirement that the trust arise prior to the act creating the debt applies with full force to what <em>Kawczynski </em>calls a \u201cstatutory trust.\u201d Thus, even assuming that a statute making misappropriation of funds a crime creates a trust, this trust arises out of the misappropriation and plays its role only at that very time.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1412-11\">Based on this requirement \u2014 that the trust arise prior to the act creating the debt \u2014 we conclude that <em>Romero </em>was wrongly decided. Even assuming that the rule providing for license revocation in instances of misappropriation creates a trust, the revocation, like the criminal penalties in the <em>Thornton </em>and <em>DIoogoff </em>statutes, occurs only upon the act of misappropriation. It simply cannot be said that the trust exists prior to the wrong and without reference to it.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1412-12\">In contrast to <em>Romero, </em>however, we think the statute involved in <em>Kawcznyski did </em>serve to impose a fiduciary duty on the contractor. To begin with, the Lien Law contains requirements very much like those traditionally imposed on a trustee. As the Court recognized, once payments are made to the contractor, \u201che must segregate and keep records of trust funds, and pay them out according to a statutory priority scheme.\u201d 442 F.Supp. at 417. Moreover, the trust clearly arises prior to and without regard to the misappropriation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1412-13\">In addition to creating independent fiduciary duties, the Lien Law makes clear <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1341\">*1341</page-number>that the trust arises prior to rather than by virtue of any claim of misappropriation of trust funds. [The Lien Law] provides that the trust commences when the contractor first receives payment from the owner, \u201cwhether or not there shall be at that time any beneficiary of the trust,\u201d and continues until all of the trust beneficiaries have been paid.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1413-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 417.</p>\n<p id=\"b1413-6\">One further diversion is necessary before we proceed to the instant case\u2014and yes, we do plan to get to it. We think it essential to clarify the precise role of state law and in so doing, to summarize the above analysis.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> To begin with, the scope of the concept fiduciary under \u00a7 17a(4) is a question of federal law. The Supreme Court has repeatedly made clear that the concept is limited to technical trusts. Thus, regardless of how a state defines fiduciary, the <em>Chapman/Davis </em>definition applies in cases involving \u00a7 17a(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b1413-7\">On the other hand, state law takes on importance in determining when a trust exists. The state may impose trust-like obligations on those entering into certain kinds of contracts, and these obligations may make a contracting party a trustee. Of course, the trust must arise prior to and without reference to the act creating the debt. We also believe that state law may play importance in determining whether a specific case involves an express trust.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1413-13\">\n<em>B. How These Principles Affect Angelle</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AECo\">Examining the case before us in light of all the above, it is clear that the District Court erred in finding that Angelle was a fiduciary under \u00a7 17a(4). To begin with, the Court applied a definition of fiduciary that is far too broad. The definition relied upon simply requires a relationship involving confidence, trust, and good faith. Under \u00a7 17a(4), however, a fiduciary relationship is limited to a technical trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b1413-14\">The only possible way Angelle could be considered a fiduciary is if Louisiana law imposed trust-like duties on contractors in his position. The only statute relevant on this point is LSA-R.S. 14:202,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> which make misappropriation of funds by a contractor a criminal offense. As in <em>Thornton </em>and <em>Dloo-goff, </em>however, even assuming the criminal statute made Angelle a trustee, Angelle would have been a trustee only at the time of and because of the misappropriation.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1413-15\">\n<em>III. Some Loose Ends</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"A_j\">Our finding that Angelle was not a fiduciary does not mean that Angelle necessari<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1342\">*1342</page-number>ly gets the complete \u201cfresh start\u201d he seeks. As we previously indicated, at least some of the five parties seeking to prevent discharge relied not only on \u00a7 17a(4), but on \u00a7 17a(2) and (8). Judge Andrus, who wrote one opinion for all three cases before him, simply assumed that each of the three parties challenging discharge raised all three theories. On the other hand, Judge Smal-lenberger did not specifically mention in either of his two opinions which of the three theories the parties raised (or on what theory he based his decision).</p>\n<p id=\"b1414-4\">The District Court obviously believed that all five parties challenging discharge relied on \u00a7 17a(4). However, because the opinion did not reach the \u00a7 17a(2) and (8) issues, we cannot tell whether, in the view of the District Court, all\u2014or any\u2014of the parties raised these two theories, let alone whether the facts would justify nondischargeability under either one.</p>\n<p id=\"b1414-5\">Accordingly, we must remand the case to the District Court, which may further remand to the Bankruptcy Court if it deems appropriate. The District Court or, on further remand, the Bankruptcy Court, should determine: (1) which parties raised \u00a7 17a(2) and \u00a7 17a(8) claims, (2) whether the parties who did not raise either or both of these claims should be granted leave to amend their complaints, and (3) whether the facts in the five cases justify non-dischargeability under \u00a7 17a(2) or \u00a7 17a(8) or both.</p>\n<p id=\"b1414-6\">REVERSED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1408-14\">. The rather complicated reasons for our uncertainty concerning which parties relied on \u00a7 17a(2) and \u00a7 17a(8) are discussed in part III of this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1409-7\">. For a detailed chronology of the relevant facts and precise financial sums involved, as found initially by Judges Andrus and Smallen-berger, see the District Court opinion, 425 F.Supp. at 824-25.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1409-8\">. The Louisiana case relied upon by Judge Smallenberger held that under the facts of the case, \u00a7 17a(2) did not prevent discharge. <em>Texas Industries v. Pruet, </em>219 So.2d 813 (La.App.1969) (discussed in note 15, <em>infra). </em>Was Judge Smallenberger similarly considering \u00a7 17a(2)? Was he considering <em>only </em>\u00a7 17a(2)? His brief opinions do not answer these questions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1409-9\">. LSA-R.S. 14:202 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1409-10\">Any person, contractor or subcontractor or agent of a contractor or subcontractor who has applied any money received on account of any contract including contracts and mortgages for interim financing, for the construction, erection, or repair of any building, structure, or other improvement to any other purpose than the settlement of claims for material and labor due or to become due for said construction or under the contract shall, in case of default on the contract, or default in payment of claims for material or labor, be fined not less than one hundred dollars nor more than five hundred dollars and imprisoned for not less than thirty days nor more than six months, and in default of fine, imprisoned for not less than thirty days nor more than six months additional.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1410-12\">. The Court also pointed out that under Louisiana law, if a building contractor does not pay certain suppliers and laborers who contribute to improvements on the landowner\u2019s property, then a lien may arise on the landowner\u2019s property and the landowner may be held personally liable for damages. LSA-R.S. 9:4801 <em>et seq. </em>The Court reasoned that because of these risks on landowners, a building contractor should be held to a high duty to apply funds advanced by a landowner to pay the expenses of the landowner\u2019s project.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1410-22\">. The Eighth Circuit quote is itself a quote from Black\u2019s Law Dictionary.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1411-8\">. The Court explicitly recognized that the Nebraska statute was very similar to the Louisiana criminal statute considered by the District Court in the instant case. 600 F.2d at 169 (citing the District Court opinion in the instant case, 425 F.Supp. at 826 n.l).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1411-13\">.

We agree with <em>Kawczynski\u2019s </em>reading of <em>Thornton, </em>namely, that <em>Thornton </em>did not reject the principle that in some situations, a trust imposed by statute could create a fiduciary relationship. <em>Thornton </em>appeared to rest on the fact that the legal duty imposed on the contractor arose out of and with reference to the claim of misappropriation. See note 10, <em>infra. </em>Similarly, Dlo<em>ogoff </em>seemed to leave open the possibility that some statutes could create fiduciary relationships.

In discussing the Nebraska criminal statute making misappropriation of funds a crime, <em>Dloogoff </em>pointed out:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1412-8\">Assuming arguendo that a fiduciary relationship of the character necessary to satisfy section 17(a)(4) existed in this case through the action of [the Nebraska criminal statute], it is difficult to see how it could have existed before the acts creating the debt. The trust must exist before the debt. [Citing Davis].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"axp-dedup-2\">600 F.2d at 169, n. 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b1412-9\"><em>Thornton, </em>although somewhat unclear in its extremely brief rationale, strongly hinted by its reference to <em>Davis </em>that its concern was that the trust did not arise before the debt was created:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"APl\">While Oregon law may impose a trusteeship upon an employer who misappropriates the monies he is contractually obligated to deduct, such a trust does not convert the employer\u2019s status to that of a fiduciary for the purposes of \u00a7 17(a)(4) of the Bankruptcy Act. [Citing Davis.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1412-15\">544 F.2d at 1007. Earlier in the opinion, the Court had cited <em>Davis </em>for the general proposition that the trust must not be one arising out of the very act of wrongdoing. See <em>id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b1412-16\">. <em>Romero </em>reasoned that because the license was obtained prior to any dealings between the contracting parties, the trust was created prior to the claim of misappropriation. 535 F.2d at 622. We are simply not persuaded by this reasoning. Trusts do not arise in the abstract, but only among parties. It is hornbook law that a trust must contain a settlor, a trustee, and beneficiaries. See 76 Am.Jur.2d Trusts, \u00a7 31, pp. 278-79 (1975).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b1413-8\">. Our analysis applies to the Bankruptcy Act as it existed prior to the amendments in 1978. It should be pointed out that the new Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978 \u2014 which is not involved in the case before us \u2014 makes changes to \u00a7 17a(4). Unlike the previous Acts, under the Bankruptcy Reform Act the phrase \u201cwhile acting in fiduciary capacity\u201d only modifies the words fraud and defalcation. Misappropriation has been dropped entirely, and the fiduciary requirement does not apply to debts resulting from embezzlement or larceny. See \u00a7 523(a)(4) of the Bankruptcy Reform Act, 11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 523(a)(4). However, where the fiduciary requirement still applies, the definition first articulated by the Supreme Court over a century ago will no doubt continue to apply, since there is nothing in the Bankruptcy Reform Act or its legislative history to suggest otherwise. See 3 Collier on Bankruptcy, \u00b6 523.14, pp. 523-98 to 523-105 (15th ed. 1979).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b1413-9\">. <em>Cf. Jaffke v. Dunham, </em>352 U.S. 280, 77 S.Ct. 307, 1 L.Ed.2d 314 (1957) (determination of whether trust established in bankruptcy proceeding under \u00a7 70(a)(4), 11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 110(a)(4), is one of state law).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b1413-16\">. The statute is quoted in note 4, <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b1413-17\">. Similarly, those provisions imposing a lien and personal liability on the landowner if the contractor does not pay suppliers and laborers, see note 5, <em>supra, </em>even if they could be read to make Angelle a trustee (which is doubtful), would arise only at the time of and because of the misappropriation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1413-18\">Our determination that the applicable Louisiana law does not create a fiduciary relationship under \u00a7 17a(4) makes it appropriate that we comment on two Louisiana cases, <em>Heyerdale v. Haneman, </em>170 So.2d 401 (La.App.1964) (discussed in the District Court opinion in the instant case, 425 F.Supp. at 8261), and <em>Texas Industries v. Pruett, </em>219 So.2d 813 (La.App.1969) (relied on by Judge Smallenberger). In <em>Heyerdale, </em>the creditor advanced funds to the bankrupt for the repair of real estate. The bankrupt did not apply the funds to pay subcontractors and materialmen. The Court\u2019s reasoning is somewhat fuzzy. The Court quoted \u00a7 17a(4) and \u00a7 17a(2), which at that time applied not only to false statements, but to willful and malicious injury to property (later <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1342\">*1342</page-number>to become \u00a7 17a(8)). The Court discussed LSA-R.S. 14:202, <em>quoted in </em>note 4, <em>supra </em>and concluded (as best we can tell) that this statute made the bankrupt a fiduciary. Thus, the Court was either relying on \u00a7 17a(4) or else was under the misimpression that \u00a7 17a(2) also contains a fiduciary requirement. In any event, we think the case was wrongly decided, for as we stated above, LSA-R.S. 14:202 does not establish a fiduciary relationship for purposes of \u00a7 17a(4). <em>Texas Industries </em>also involved misapplication of funds in the context of a construction contract. The challenge to discharge was based not on \u00a7 17a(4), but on \u00a7 17a(2). Section 17a(2) contains no fiduciary requirement. The Court concluded that the evidence did not demonstrate that the bankrupt made any false representations or maliciously and willfully injured the property of the creditors. The Court went on, however, to discuss <em>Heyerdale, </em>holding that <em>Heyerdale </em>did not apply because the bankrupt in <em>Texas Industries </em>did not divert funds to her own use. The Court pointed out that LSA-R.S. 14:202 applies only to misapplication of funds for personal use. Since the creditor in <em>Texas Industries </em>did not attempt to rely on \u00a7 17a(4), we cannot understand why the Court in Texas <em>Industries </em>found it necessary to distinguish <em>Heyerdale. </em>In any event, to the extent that language in <em>Texas Industries </em>reaffirms the conclusion in <em>Heyer-dale </em>that LSA-R.S. 14:202 may create a fiduciary relationship for purposes of \u00a7 17a(4), we disagree with such language.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
