United States, </em>389 U.S. 90, 96, 88 S.Ct. 269, 274, 19 L.Ed.2d 305, 310 (1967) (in which review was sought by the government); <em>cf. Helstoski </em>v. <em>Meanor, </em>442 U.S. 500, 99 S.Ct. 2445, 61 L.Ed.2d 30 (1979) (denying a writ of mandamus to a defendant who had a remedy by appeal).</p>\n<p id=\"b300-18\">All parties agree that there is no precedent for staying the trial. Having carefully considered the motion and the consequences of granting as well as those of denying it, both in the present case and as a precedent for this circuit, we conclude that it should be DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
