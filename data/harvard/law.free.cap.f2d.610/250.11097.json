The record affords no basis for any conclusion that prejudice infected the guilty verdict as to these counts for reason of non-compliance with Rule 30, F.R.Crim.P.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b323-8\">The petition for rehearing on behalf of Dan Sanchez, Jr., and Lewis Woodul is DENIED and no member of this panel nor judge in regular active service on the court having requested that the court be polled on rehearing en banc, (Rule 35 Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure; Local Fifth Circuit Rule 16) the petition for rehearing en banc on behalf of said parties is DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
