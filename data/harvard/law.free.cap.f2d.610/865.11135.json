In the first case, No. 77-1596, we review the Commission\u2019s compensation schedule for Texas and Pacific Railway Company\u2019s (Texas and Pacific) operation of an Amtrak train, the Inter-American, between Fort Worth, Texas and Texarkana, Arkansas.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In the second case, No. 77-1626, we review the Commission\u2019s assessment of payments due the Terminal Railroad Association of St. Louis for Amtrak\u2019s use of its St. Louis railroad terminal and adjoining tracks.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-21\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b939-22\">As an initial matter, we are called upon to interpret section 10(1) of the Amtrak <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"868\">*868</page-number>Improvement Act of 1973 (1973 Act), Pub.L. No. 93-146, 87 Stat. 548, 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 562(a) (1976) (current version at 45 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 562(a) (1978)), which commands that the Commission \u201c[i]n fixing just and reasonable compensation for the provision of services [to Amtrak by other railroads] shall, in fixing compensation in excess of incremental costs, consider quality of service as a major factor in determining the amount (if any) of such compensation.\u201d The question presented is whether this quality of service factor applies to the supplier railroad\u2019s recovery of non-incremental costs for Amtrak\u2019s use of tracks and facilities, as well as to the supplier railroad\u2019s recovery of non-incremental costs related to the provision of services.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-4\">Incremental costs are costs that the supplier railroad would avoid if passenger service were discontinued. Non-incremental costs would remain even if Amtrak service were halted. Both parties agree that supplier railroads should recover the incremental costs of running Amtrak trains. The Commission argues that a supplier railroad may charge Amtrak its share of non-incremental property costs regardless of the quality of service, but that non-incremental service costs are recoverable only if the supplier railroad meets certain quality criteria. Amtrak, on the other hand, rejects this distinction between costs for services provided and costs for use of tracks and facilities. It claims that quality of service criteria limit payment of non-incremental service and property costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-5\">Although the vitality of the debate has been dissipated by a 1978 amendment to the 1973 Act<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> that, as applicable to future cases, adopts the Amtrak position, the case before us must be decided on the basis of the 1973 Act. <em>See </em>text at \u2014 of \u2014 U.S.App.D.C., at 873 of 610 F.2d, <em>supra. </em>Upon consideration of relatively clear statutory language, ambiguous legislative history behind the 1973 Act, and interpretations rendered by both the Commission and a subsequent Congress, we hold that the tei-m \u201cservices\u201d as employed by the 1973 Act does not include costs associated with Amtrak\u2019s \u201cuse of tracks and facilities,\u201d see section 15, Amtrak Improvement Act of 1978 (1978 Act), Pub.L. No. 95-421, 92 Stat. 923, 45 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 562(a) (1978), and compensation for property costs is not limited by quality criteria.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-11\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b940-12\">Congress enacted the Rail Passenger Service Act of 1970 (1970 Act), Pub.L. No. 91-518, 84 Stat. 1327 (current version in scattered sections of ch. 14, 45 U.S.C.A. (1978)), to preserve rail passenger service in the United States. Specifically, the 1970 Act created the National Railroad Passenger Corporation, a quasi-public corporation authorized to maintain inter-city railroad passenger service. Congress also appropriated $340 million in federal financial assistance to the Corporation.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The 1970 Act authorized the Corporation to assume by contract the inter-city rail passenger service obligations of railroads who wished to be relieved of their obligations as common carriers of passengers by rail. In consideration for the agreement, these \u201ccontracting\u201d railroads, <em>see </em>text at \u2014 of 197 U.S.App. D.C., at 878 of 610 F.2d, <em>infra, </em>paid to Amtrak the money they saved by relinquishing deficit-ridden passenger service.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b940-14\">Section 402(a) of the 1970 Act, 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 562(a) (1976), provided the Corporation with two means to utilize the resources of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"869\">*869</page-number>railroads in furtherance of the Corporation\u2019s duties. Section 402(a) allowed the Corporation and a railroad to agree on a price for the Corporation\u2019s \u201cuse of tracks and other facilities and the provision of services.\u201d If the Corporation and Amtrak could not agree, the 1970 Act provided that the Commission could \u201corder the provision of services or the use of tracks or facilities of the railroad by the Corporation, on such terms and for such compensation as the Commission may fix as just and reasonable.\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b941-4\">In order to guide the Commission\u2019s determination of the proper costs to be assumed by the Corporation, Congress in 1973 amended 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 562(a). Section 10(1) provides that: \u201cIn fixing just and reasonable compensation for the provision of services ordered by the Commission [under section 402], the Commission shall, in fixing compensation in excess of incremental costs, consider quality of service as a major factor in determining the amount (if any) of such compensation.\u201d The sentence added in 1973 refers explicitly only to \u201cthe provision of services,\u201d whereas the 1970 Act referred three times in the preceding two sentences to \u201cthe use of tracks and other facilities and the provision of services.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> This shift in language provides the basis for the Commission\u2019s contention that the 1973 Act demands the use of quality criteria only to affect the payment of non-incremental service costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-11\">The statutory language of the 1973 Act, on its face, appears to support the Commission by speaking solely to one of two possible types of cost previously recognized by the statute. The plain language, however, does not conclusively resolve the Commission\u2019s contention, for even the most t&gt;asic principle of statutory construction must yield to clear evidence of contrary legislative intent. <em>Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press v. Sampson, </em>192 U.S.App. D.C. 335, 339, 591 F.2d 944, 948 (D.C.Cir. 1978); <em>see Harrison v. Northern Trust Co., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"870\">*870</page-number>317 U.S. 476, 479, 63 S.Ct. 361, 87 L.Ed. 407 (1943). Accordingly, we examine the legislative history for evidence of clear congressional intent that the term \u201cservices\u201d in section 10(1) of the 1973 Act should be defined more expansively than the term \u201cservices\u201d as used in section 402(a) of the 1970 Act. In construing the provision, we are mindful of the deference due an administrative agency\u2019s reasonable interpretation of a statute controlling its activities. <em>See Train v. Natural Resources Defense Council, </em>421 U.S. 60, 87, 95 S.Ct. 1470, 43 L.Ed.2d 731 (1975); <em>ASARCO Inc. v. EPA, </em>188 U.S. App.D.C. 77, 83-84, 578 F.2d 319, 325-26 (D.C.Cir. 1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b942-4\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b942-5\">As noted previously, Congress enacted the original version of 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 562(a) as part of the 1970 Act which created the National Railroad Passenger Corporation. The 1970 Act mandated only that Amtrak pay supplier railroads a \u201cjust and reasonable\u201d rate. This standard was not unique. Section 3(5) of the Interstate Commerce Act, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 3(5) (repealed by Act of Oct. 17, 1978, Pub.L. No. 95-473, 92 Stat. 1466), for example, stated that the Commission shall set a \u201cjust and reasonable\u201d rate to be paid by one railroad to another railroad for use of terminal facilities. The Commission interpretation of \u201cjust and reasonable\u201d in that context did not limit the supplier railroad\u2019s recovery to incremental costs. <em>Seaboard Air Line Railroad, </em>327 I.C.C. 1, 9 (1965); <em>Missouri-Kansas-Texas Railroad v. Kansas City Terminal Railway, </em>198 I.C.C. 4, 9-11 (1933).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Similarly, the \u201cjust and reasonable\u201d standard set forth in the 1970 Act did not base compensation upon the computation of incremental costs for the provision of services and the use of track and facilities. \u201cJust and reasonable\u201d compensation could be computed without distinguishing between incremental and non-incremental costs.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b942-10\">Incremental and non-incremental costs were first differentiated in the 1973 Act.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The language of section 10(1) commands that the Commission \u201cin fixing just and reasonable compensation for the provisions of services . . . consider quality of service as a major factor in determining the amount (if any) of such compensation,\u201d originated in H.R. 8351, a bill subsequently <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"871\">*871</page-number>enacted as section 10(1) of the 1973 Act.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The House Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce, which sent H.R. 8351 to the full House, explained the purpose of the proposed language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b943-5\">Section 402(a) of the Rail Passenger Service Act of 1970, as amended, presently provides for AMTRAK to pay to a railroad, for services performed by it or for the use of its properties and facilities, such compensation as the Interstate Commerce Commission \u201cmay fix as just and reasonable.\u201d While the Commission, in fixing such compensation, may consider the quality of service rendered by the railroad, there is no present statutory requirement that the Commission do so\u2014 nor is there any indication of the weight Congress intended to be given the quality of service.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b943-6\">The committee\u2019s amendment of section 402(a) is intended to provide the following: (1) a floor for the compensation to be paid a railroad for services performed; and (2) a recognition that the higher the quality of service, the greater the compensation to be received.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b943-7\">H.Rep. No. 93-415, 93d Cong., 1st Sess. at 11 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b943-8\">Although the language of the House Report distinguishes between services performed and use of properties, congressional debate was not always as precise. During the debate preceding initial House passage of the amendment, Congressman Harvey referred to \u201cquality of service\u201d without expressly distinguishing use of tracks and other facilities from services performed. 119 Cong.Rec. 28746 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b943-9\">The Conference Committee, which met to resolve differences between the House and Senate versions of the 1973 Act, adopted the language of H.R. 8351. The Committee\u2019s explanation of the section is ambiguous: \u201cThe term \u2018incremental\u2019 is to be considered then as meaning those costs which would not be incurred if a particular service were not rendered or a given amount of traffic were not handled.\u201d H.Rep. No. 93-587, 93d Cong., 1st Sess. at 16 (1973). Although this definition refers specifically only to services, reference to \u201ca given amount of traffic\u201d is capable of broader construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-12\">Both the House and Senate referred again to section 10(1) of the 1973 Act during debate prior to adoption of the Conference Report. Representative Dingell repeated \u201cthat the railroads shall be paid above avoidable costs only on the basis of the quality of service afforded.\u201d 119 Cong.Rec. 34481 (1973). Senator Magnuson informed the Senate that \u201cquality of service is to be the major determinant of any payments in excess of short-run avoidable costs.\u201d 119 Cong.Rec. 34591 (1973). As the previous excerpts demonstrate, congressional debate concerning the language of section 10(1) of the 1973 Act fails to indicate expressly that the term \u201cservices\u201d was intended to be defined more expansively in the third sentence than in the first two sentences of section 402(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b943-13\">Amtrak also contends that legislative discussion of <em>Penn Central </em>\u2014 Compensation <em>for Passenger Service, </em>342 I.C.C. 820 (1973), demonstrates express congressional disapproval of the Commission\u2019s construction of the 1973 Act. Prior to the issuance of the Conference Report, the Commission ruled on the amount of compensation Amtrak owed the Penn Central railroad under the 1970 version of section 402(a). The Commission chose between three different compensation formulas:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b943-14\">Penn Central urges us to adopt as the \u201cbenchmark\u201d of the compensation formu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"872\">*872</page-number>la promulgated herein the fully allocated cost of its intercity passenger operations. Amtrak urges us instead to adopt as the \u201cbenchmark\u201d the avoidable cost of such intercity passenger operations. Full cost represents those costs, both solely related and a portion of the unattributable common, directly allocable to a particular service. Avoidable cost in the short run, hereinafter referred to as the incremental cost, represents that amount of maintenance of way, maintenance of equipment, and transportation expenses which could be saved if a particular service were eliminated. Avoidable cost in the long run, hereinafter referred to as the avertable cost, represents the variable and fixed costs directly traceable to the particular service, as well as the common costs which vary with the level of traffic attributable to that particular service. The avertable cost, therefore, may be defined as the operating expenses, rents, taxes, and rate of return on property directly allocable to the particular service. Fixed common expenses are not ordinarily included within the avertable cost, but where the justifiability of a particular service is significantly large relative to the justifiability of the entire system operation, the avertable cost will include the service\u2019s share of the common fixed cost as determined primarily and usually on the basis of original investment decision. Justifiability in an economic context reflects both the profitability of a particular service and the social benefit of that service.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b944-4\"><em>Penn Central </em>\u2014 Compensation <em>for Passenger Service, </em>342 I.C.C. at 831-32. The Commission adopted the more generous full cost approach to measure the base compensation due Penn Central for Amtrak operations along the Boston-Washington corridor, in which intercity passenger traffic constituted 40% of total operations. The Commission employed the avertable cost standard for Penn Central operations conducted outside the Boston-Washington corridor, in which passenger travel accounted for a \u201cminimal\u201d portion of total operations. <em>Id </em>at 833. Further, the Commission held that the \u201cquality of services rendered\u201d would affect Penn Central compensation for both corridor and non-corridor operations. <em>Id </em>at 834.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-6\">The Commission\u2019s <em>Penn Central </em>decision was handed down on September 19, 1973. The Conference Report, issued a month later, explicitly criticized the Commission\u2019s determination that Penn Central \u201cshould receive additional compensation in excess of avoidable costs in the Boston-Washington Corridor.\u201d H.Rep. No. 93-587 at 16. The Conference Committee, noting Penn Central\u2019s poor record of performance, stated that \u201cat present performance levels, the railroads are not entitled to the compensation base that could be established under the Commission\u2019s ruling.\u201d <em>Id</em></p>\n<p id=\"b944-7\">Discontent with the <em>Penn Central </em>decision was evident in both houses during the floor debates that preceded final enactment of the 1973 Act. In the House, Representative Dingell expressed the congressional intent to \u201cvitiate that particular unwise action of the ICC.\u201d After Representative Dingell noted \u201cthat the quality of service afforded by Penn Central is uniquely poor,\u201d Representative Kuykendall denounced the <em>Penn Central </em>decision to allocate full cost to the Penn Central as \u201cback-door financing to an outfit that, frankly, has disgraced the entire railroad industry.\u201d 119 Cong.Rec. 34481. In the Senate, Senator Magnuson expressed similar sentiments. \u201cThe conferees,\u201d he said, \u201cmade clear that payments in excess of short-run [avoidable] costs are to be based on quality of service.\u201d 119 Cong.Rec. 34591.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-8\">The 1973 Act thus legislatively reversed the Commission\u2019s decision that Penn Central should have received payments for the full cost, both incremental and non-incremental, of Amtrak operations in the Boston-Washington corridor. Instead, Congress mandated use of the term \u201cincremental costs,\u201d which appears to coincide with the Commission\u2019s definition: \u201cAvoidable cost in the short run, hereinafter referred to as the incremental cost, represents that amount of maintenance of way, maintenance of equipment, and transportation ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"873\">*873</page-number>penses which could be saved if a particular service were eliminated.\u201d <em>Penn Central, </em>342 I.C.C. at 832. Amtrak contends that the decision to overrule <em>Penn Central </em>indicates that Congress wanted all non-incremental costs, both service and property, to be governed by quality of service criteria. Congress, having set the \u201cjust and reasonable\u201d standard for the computation of compensation generally, might have wanted only non-incremental service costs to be governed by quality of service criteria. Since either interpretation overrules the decision in <em>Penn Central </em>that all non-incremental costs should be included in the base compensation, we conclude that this portion of the legislative history of the 1973 Act is not conclusive.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-5\">In sum, the legislative history of section 402(a) prior to enactment of the 1978 amendments<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> contains congressional statements that fail to limit expressly the import of the 1973 amendment to services, but reveals no explicit statement that the distinction between provision of services and use of track found in the 1970 Act was to be disregarded in construing section 10(1) of the 1973 Act. Moreover, the avowed congressional intent behind the 1973 Act to override the Commission\u2019s decision in <em>Penn Central </em>to use a full costs standard is carried out no matter which reading of the 1973 Act governs.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-6\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b945-7\">Section 15 of the 1978 Act, Pub.L. No. 95-421, 92 Stat. 923, 45 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 562(a) (1978), added the phrase \u201cor for the use of tracks and facilities\u201d to the language of section 402(a). The statute now reads, in part: \u201cIn fixing just and reasonable compensation for the provision of services or for the use of tracks and facilities ordered by the Commission under the preceding sentence, the Commission shall, in fixing compensation in excess of incremental costs, consider quality of service as a major factor in determining the amount (if any) of such compensation.\u201d If the 1978 Act applied to this case, Amtrak would prevail. Our obligation to apply the law in effect at the time of our decision does not apply, however, if Congress expressly intended the previous statute to govern. <em>Bradley </em>v. <em>School Board of Richmond, </em>416 U.S. 696, 711, 94 S.Ct. 2006, 40 L.Ed.2d 476 (1974); <em>Potomac Electric Power Co. v. United States, </em>190 U.S. App.D.C. 77, 85, 584 F.2d 1058, 1066 (D.C. Cir. 1978). Because the Conference Report on the 1978 Act clearly instructs \u201cthe courts to give this amendment [to section 402(a)] prospective application only,\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> we are left with the task of interpreting the 1973 Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-11\">The legislative history of the 1978 Act, although not dispositive, may guide our interpretation of the term \u201cservices\u201d as employed in the 1973 Act. As we have noted recently:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b945-12\">[I]t is a well established principle that courts may look to subsequent legislation as an aid in the interpretation of prior legislation dealing with the same or similar subject matter. Indeed, Chief Justice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"874\">*874</page-number>Marshall stated the principle that, if it can be gathered from a subsequent statute <em>in pari materia </em>what meaning the legislature attached to the words of a former statute, this will amount to a legislative declaration of its meaning, and will govern the construction of the first statute.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b946-4\"><em>Jordan v. Department of Justice, </em>192 U.S. App.D.C. 144, 161, 591 F.2d 753, 770 (D.C. Cir. 1978) (en banc) (footnotes omitted); <em>see Erlenbaugh v. United States, </em>409 U.S. 239, 243-44, 93 S.Ct. 477, 34 L.Ed.2d 446 (1972). Section 15 of the 1978 Act is <em>in pari materia </em>with section 10(1) of the 1973 Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-5\">The legislative history of the 1978 Act demonstrates that the addition of the phrase \u201cor for the use of tracks and facilities\u201d constitutes a change from the previous law. The congressional decision to give the amendment only prospective application reinforces the conclusion that Congress believed the 1978 Act restructured the compensation formula set forth in section 402(a). The Conference Committee stated that the additional language</p>\n<blockquote id=\"alg-dedup-0\">amends section 402(a) of the Rail Passenger Service Act by directing the ICC, in fixing \u201cjust and reasonable\u201d compensation, to include tracks and facilities under the incremental cost concept. The conference substitute changes the law to permit incentives for good quality track and facilities. The conferees do not intend to affect any existing contracts between railroads and Amtrak. Neither do the conferees intend for incentive payments to be made only for improvement in track and facilities. Incremental costs now become the threshold for determining \u201cjust and reasonable\u201d compensation should the Commission have to resolve the matter. Furthermore, the conferees expect the Commission and the courts to give this amendment prospective application only.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b946-9\">H.Rep.

The addition of the phrase \u201cor for the use of tracks and facilities\u201d in itself implies that Congress, alert to the dichotomy between provision of services and use of tracks enunciated in the opening sentences of section 402(a), enlarged the \u201cincremental cost\u201d sentence to include use of track and facilities. This impression is heightened by the Conference Committee\u2019s declaration that the 1978 amendment changed the law, and by the clear congressional intent to apply the 1978 amendment prospectively to avoid interference with the adjudication of this case. Congressional silence would have compelled the application of the 1978 Act in this case, but Congress\u2019s express alteration of the normal effect of legislative action on pending litigation cannot be ignored.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-11\">We hold that, for the purposes of the statutory standard applicable to the allowance by the Commission of compensation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"875\">*875</page-number>for non-incremental costs, the term \u201cservices\u201d in the 1973 Act was not meant to include tracks and other facilities. Although legislative history prior to the 1978 Act is ambiguous, the combination of the plain language of the statute, which appears to contemplate a distinction between provision of services and use of tracks, the Commission\u2019s interpretation of the Act, to which we accord some deference, and the obvious congressional intent underlying adoption of the 1978 Act, which is <em>in pari materia </em>with the 1973 Act, conclusively solves the issue of statutory interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b947-6\">We turn now to the application of section 402(a) in these consolidated cases. We begin with <em>Amtrak and The Texas &amp; Pacific Railway Use of Tracks and Facilities and Establishment of Just Compensation (Texas &amp; Pacific), </em>348 I.C.C. 645 (1976), in which Amtrak, unable to agree with a supplier railroad, petitioned the Commission under section 402(a) to fix \u201cjust and reasonable\u201d rates for the provision of services or the use of track and facilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-7\">Section 402(a) does not, in the ordinary course of events, require Commission approval of every Amtrak-railroad contract. Rather, the Commission\u2019s role is to arbitrate an unresolved dispute between two negotiating parties. The Commission, guided by the language of section 402(a), has broad discretion to choose an appropriate level of compensation. Recognizing the Commission\u2019s role pursuant to section 402(a) as settlor of disputes between intransigent</p>\n<p id=\"b947-11\">parties, we will sustain a Commission\u2019s order under section 402(a) if its decision is a rational accommodation of opposing interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-12\">In <em>Texas &amp; Pacific, </em>Amtrak requested the Commission to set the compensation terms for the operation by the Texas and Pacific Railway Company (Texas and Pacific) of Amtrak\u2019s train, the Inter-American, which travels thrice weekly between Texarkana, Arkansas and Fort Worth, Texas. The Commission\u2019s decision covers the payments due from March 12, 1975 to May 1, 1978.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b947-13\">The Commission\u2019s methodology was as follows: It divided costs related to provision of services into incremental and non-incremental costs. Incremental service costs were automatically recoverable by the railroad. Non-incremental service costs could be recovered only if the railroad met certain quality of service standards. As noted</p>\n<p id=\"b947-14\">previously, <em>see </em>text at -- of 197 U.S.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-15\">App.D.C., at 872 of 610 F.2d, <em>supra, </em>incremental costs are avoidable costs \u2014 costs that would not be incurred if no passenger service were performed for Amtrak. <em>See </em>H.Rep. No. 93-415 at 11 (1973); H.Rep. No. 93-587 at 16 (1973). The Commission determined property costs by setting charges for the use of tracks and facilities pursuant to the \u201cjust and reasonable\u201d standard. It did not distinguish incremental from non-incremental property costs. Finally, the Commission created quality of service standards which governed Amtrak\u2019s payment of non-incremental service costs.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b947-16\">The Commission calculated cost figures for twelve service and property factors,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> then determined the quality of service crite<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"876\">*876</page-number>ria. The quality of service criteria was primarily the on-time performance standard. As the Commission noted, \u201cthe only feasible service standard would appear to be one defined in terms of on-time performance, [as] a slack schedule would make high on-time performance readily obtainable without any improvement in the railroad\u2019s performance.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The Commission considered the applicable speed limits, the high volume of freight traffic between Texar-kana and Fort Worth, and the limited number of sidings available along the route and established a running time of 345 minutes as the on-time baseline figure to be used in measuring quality of performance. <em>Id. </em>at 671.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b947-18\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"875\">*875</page-number>Cost Category T&amp;P proposal Amtrak proposal Commission decision</p>\n<p id=\"AuM\">Direct costs:</p>\n<p id=\"AEgv\">1 Train and engine crews _____________ $17,084 $17,160 $17,084</p>\n<p id=\"Ag3\">2 Meals and lodging__________________ 1,323 1,794 1,323</p>\n<p id=\"b948-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"876\">*876</page-number>In order to guarantee Texas and Pacific its out-of-pocket expenses and to encourage superior performance, the Commission adopted the following quality of service standard:</p>\n<p id=\"Aoq\">Cost Category T&amp;P proposal Amtrak proposal Commission decision</p>\n<p id=\"Ahr\">Direct costs \u2014 Continued</p>\n<p id=\"AxW\">3 Fuel____________________________ 7,061 6,422 6,514</p>\n<p id=\"aey-dedup-0\">4 Equipment maintenance, servicing, and inspection ___________ - -- 639 278 450</p>\n<p id=\"A1NK\">5 Station maintenance and utilities - - - _ 390 390 390</p>\n<p id=\"a6j-dedup-0\">6 Track and roadbed maintenance . - - . 23,084 1,430 4,673</p>\n<p id=\"Aa2\">Common costs:</p>\n<p id=\"AGh\">7 Train movement service expense ____ 2,067 0 <footnotemark>1</footnotemark>1,257</p>\n<p id=\"azz-dedup-0\">8 Supervision __ . ----- _ _ \u2014 8,268 0 <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> 2,579</p>\n<p id=\"ajg-dedup-0\">Property costs:</p>\n<p id=\"AqEy\">9 Property taxes ___________________ 550 0 500</p>\n<p id=\"ApE\">10 Station rent __________ ________ 400 0 100</p>\n<p id=\"AujJ\">11 Return on investment _ ___________ 6,495 0 2,273</p>\n<p id=\"AU9i\">Liability:</p>\n<p id=\"Ax6\">12 Liability risk_________ . _ . . \u2014 0 237 473</p>\n<p id=\"amu-dedup-1\">Total - _____________________ . 67,361 27,711 37,666</p>\n<p id=\"aib-dedup-0\">NOTE: The figures shown are all based on 6,448 Amtrak train-miles per month and are adjustable proportionately to reflect any change.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-13\"><em>Id. </em>at 677.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b948-6\">(1) T &amp;

Pacific </em>decision. First, Amtrak contends that a <em>force majeure </em>clause governing Texas and Pacific\u2019s performance standards is unreasonable and contradicts Commission precedent. Second, Amtrak argues that specific cost figures calculated by the Commission are unsupportable.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-15\">Use of a <em>force majeure </em>provision in conjunction with the 80% minimum service standard, Amtrak argues, allows Texas and Pacific to receive incentive payments for poor service in contravention of congressional intent. Amtrak has failed, however, to demonstrate that Texas and Pacific service has been, or will be, inadequate. Although Amtrak did suggest a running time for the Inter-American shorter than the running time selected by the Commission,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Amtrak has not shown that the Commission\u2019s choice of an on-time performance standard was unreasonable. <em>See </em>note 19 and accompanying text <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b949-16\">Amtrak also contends that the use of a <em>force majeure </em>provision directly contradicts previous Commission precedent. If the Commission has, as Amtrak charges, inex-plicitly ignored its own precedent, then the Commission\u2019s decision cannot stand. As this court has stated on numerous occasions, an administrative agency must not abandon its past principles without reasoned analy<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"878\">*878</page-number>sis. <em>See Road Sprinkler Fitters Local Union No. 669 v. NLRB, </em>195 U.S.App.D.C. 104, 109, 600 F.2d 918, 923 (D.C.Cir. 1979); <em>Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc. </em>v. <em>FCC, </em>147 U.S.App.D.C. 175, 183, 454 F.2d 1018, 1026 (D.C.Cir. 1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b950-4\">In a similar section 402(a) case involving Amtrak and the Union Pacific Railroad, the Commission adopted an 80% on-time performance standard. The Commission rejected Union Pacific\u2019s request for the inclusion of a force <em>majeure </em>provision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b950-5\">We do not agree with Union Pacific that late performance should be excused when such results from acts of God. The 80-percent baseline level in itself recognizes and makes allowance for occasions on which on-time performance is not possible. In addition, we believe that such condition would lead to disputes as to the cause of late performance and the categorization of such cause. Union Pacific shall be excused for late performance where the train is delayed due to specific instructions from Amtrak.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b950-6\"><em>National Railroad Passenger Corp. &amp; Union Pacific Railroad Use of Tracks &amp; Facilities &amp; Establishment of Just Compensation (Union Pacific), </em>348 I.C.C. 926, 951 (1977). In the present case, however, the Commission limited full compliance with an' 80% on-time performance standard by adopting a clause that provides, \u201clate performance shall be excusable when hindered by <em>force majeure </em>such as strikes, riots, floods, acts of God, et cetera . . . ,\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b950-7\">The Commission defends this seeming inconsistency by distinguishing between contracting railroads, which were relieved of the burden of carrying passengers by the creation of Amtrak, and non-contracting railroads, which were not carrying passenger traffic when Amtrak was created, <em>see </em>text at \u2014 of 197 U.S.App.D.C., at 868 of 610 F.2d, <em>supra. </em>The Commission argues that because non-contracting railroads, such as Texas and Pacific, are not relieved of any burdens by Amtrak, their rates may be higher than charges levied by contracting railroads, such as Union Pacific, which are indebted to Amtrak for takeover of their passenger service.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b950-13\">The distinction does not justify the difference. A <em>force majeure </em>provision governs the burden of costs that cannot be controlled by either party. In so doing, it places a financial burden on one party rather than another, but does not create greater performance incentives for contracting railroads than for non-contracting railroads. Nevertheless, use of the <em>force majeure </em>provision may affect the ability of a railroad to meet its 80% on-time minimum performance standard. If a <em>force majeure </em>event occurs, a non-contracting railroad will be able to meet the performance standard more easily than a contracting railroad. For example, a Texas and Pacific train delayed by an act of God will not be included in determining compliance with the monthly performance standard. A similarly delayed Union Pacific train, however, would diminish that railroad\u2019s ability to meet the performance standard. Thus, it is possible that the Commission chose to adopt a <em>force majeure </em>provision instead of employing a performance standard of less than 80% for the Texas and Pacific Railroad.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-14\">The Commission\u2019s decision does not, however, reveal this line of reasoning, and we will not review a ground not employed by the agency. <em>Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States, </em>371 U.S. 156, 168-69, 83 S.Ct. 239, 9 L.Ed.2d 207 (1962). Further, we fail to see why the distinction would affect the commission\u2019s alternative rationale for rejecting use of a <em>force majeure </em>clause in <em>Union Pacific </em>\u2014 the parties\u2019 inability to adjudicate \u201cdisputes as to the cause of late performance and the categorization of such cause.\u201d <footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Accordingly, we remand this portion of the Commission\u2019s decision for reconsideration and further explanation.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"879\">*879</page-number>Finally, Amtrak attacks the Commission\u2019s computation of specific service costs by suggesting that the choice of a formula used to compute track and roadbed maintenance charges is inconsistent with that used in the <em>Union Pacific </em>case. <em>See Union Pacific, </em>348 I.C.C. at 946. In <em>Union Pacific, </em>the Commission employed the \u201cAmtrak\u201d formula, which multiplies the gross ton-miles of Amtrak service by an average calculated railroad maintenance-of-way cost per route-mile. In the <em>Texas &amp; Pacific </em>case, the Commission calculated a figure by multiplying the number of gross ton-miles of Amtrak service by Texas and Pacific\u2019s actual maintenance cost per gross ton-mile.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> We believe the Commission adequately explained its rejection of the Amtrak proposal. The Commission, noting Texas and Pacific\u2019s contention that its maintenance costs were higher than average, employed actual maintenance costs incurred by Texas and Pacific in calculating the appropriate cost figure.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> In the absence of any suggestion that Texas and Pacific\u2019s actual maintenance costs were unjustified, the Commission cannot be faulted for applying specific calculations instead of a general formula.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-5\">We have examined Amtrak\u2019s other objections to the Commission\u2019s computation of service costs and find them similarly without merit. It bears repeating that the Commission, when called upon to fix compensation pursuant to section 402(a), acts in a significantly different capacity than when called upon to regulate common carrier activity in the first instance. In this case, the Commission is not administering a pervasive system of regulation; rather, it is called upon to settle within ninety days a contractual dispute between two deadlocked parties. <em>See </em>45 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 562(a) (1978).<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> In a situation in which the Commission must act as mediator, we do not find the Commission\u2019s decision unreasonable. Consequently, the remainder of the Commission\u2019s decision may be upheld as a reasonable accommodation between the parties\u2019 competing positions.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b951-10\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b951-11\">Finally, we review the Commission\u2019s decision in <em>National Railroad Passenger Corp. &amp; Terminal Railroad Association of St. Louis et al., Use of Tracks &amp; Facilities &amp; Establishment of Just Compensation (TRRA), </em>348 I.C.C. 901 (1977). Amtrak, under section 402(a), asked the Commission to order the Terminal Railroad Association of St. Louis (TRRA) to provide it with service, tracks, and facilities at the St. Louis Union Station in St. Louis, Missouri. Amtrak also requested the Commission to set compensation terms payable under section 402(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b951-12\">After the Commission determined the \u201cjust and reasonable\u201d compensation for rental use of the station, it then utilized TRRA\u2019s multiple-zone system to measure Amtrak\u2019s obligation to pay for the use of track leading into the station.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> The zone system divides the terminal area into sixty-one separate geographic \u201czones.\u201d Costs are allocated on the basis of a railroad\u2019s pattern of use in each zone. Amtrak operates railroads in nine of the sixty-one zones.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-13\">Amtrak argues that the Commission\u2019s decision violates section 402(a)\u2019s \u201cquality of service\u201d limitation since the costs allocated by the zone system include both property costs (e. <em>g., </em>use of track) and service costs (e. <em>g., </em>track and roadbed maintenance). The Commission acknowledges that the zone system does not distinguish between <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"880\">*880</page-number>incremental and non-incremental service costs attendant to the use of tracks. The Commission explains, however, that the distinction is difficult, if not impossible, to make in a situation in which many railroads use common facilities, and that Amtrak\u2019s only alternative was the suggestion that its use of the tracks and facilities was not compensable. As the Commission further noted, Amtrak explicitly recognized that \u201cit is apparent that Amtrak\u2019s use requires the expenditures of some maintenance funds,\u201d while insisting that its use of tracks \u201ccre-at[ed] no avoidable costs . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b952-4\">Theoretically, the level of maintenance could be decreased if less trains used the track. Difficulties arise, however, in calculating the avoidable cost if only Amtrak traffic ceased. With the data before it, the Commission could only guess whether Amtrak\u2019s shorter and lighter passenger trains demanded a proportionately smaller percentage of maintenance funds than the longer and heavier freight cars, or whether passenger trains, which must provide a smoother ride than freight cars, demand a proportionately larger percentage of maintenance funds. The parties failed to introduce evidence to support either proposition. Accordingly, the Commission justifiably relied on the pre-existing zone system.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-5\">In cases arising under the 1973 Act, in which only non-incremental service costs must be coupled with quality standards, we hold that the Commission may levy against Amtrak the non-incremental and incremental cost of services without use of quality criteria if two conditions are met: (1) the Commission must have been unable to distinguish between incremental and non-incremental costs on the information supplied to it; and (2) payment of non-incremental service costs must not obviously harm Amtrak by forcing it to pay for the type of poor service that aroused congressional ire after the <em>Penn Central </em>decision. <em>See </em>text at \u2014\u2014\u2014 of \u2014 U.S.App.D.C., at 872-873 of 610 F.2d, <em>supra.</em><footnotemark><em>32</em></footnotemark><em> </em>A contrary holding might force the Commission to apply quality of service criteria to all service costs, even if it could not distinguish between incremental and non-incremental costs. If the Commission had followed this course, however, a railroad failing to meet quality of service criteria might not even receive its incremental costs. There is no legislative intent that would justify forcing a railroad to accommodate Amtrak operations without the recovery of at least its incremental costs. Moreover, we believe that our decision today properly places a burden on Amtrak, which is the beneficiary of the \u201cquality of service\u201d provision, to come forward with a proposal explaining how incremental and non-incremental common service costs may be distinguished.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b952-11\">In the <em>TRRA </em>case, the Commission\u2019s decision to retain the zone system for the allocation of costs was just and reasonable. As noted above, Amtrak did not supply data tending to show what level of track and roadbed maintenance would be required if Amtrak trains did not use the St. Louis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"881\">*881</page-number>terminal. The absence of data was crucial for, as the Commission noted in a similar context,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b953-5\">[P]ast efforts to develop general formulas for estimating track and roadbed maintenance costs have not resulted in wide acceptance. This is primarily due to two factors: (1) the lack of sufficient emperical data from which to draw conclusions by statistical analysis; and (2) the absence of scientific theory from which to derive equations relating track [depreciation] to a myriad of independent variables which cause it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b953-6\"><em>TRRA, </em>348 I.C.C. at 919 n.29 (quoting <em>Texas &amp; Pacific, </em>348 I.C.C. at 661).

Under these circumstances, the Commission\u2019s decision must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-7\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b953-8\">For the foregoing reasons, the Commission\u2019s decision in No. 77-1596 is affirmed in part and remanded in part; and the Commission\u2019s decision in No. 77-1626 is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-9\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b939-13\">.

Amtrak argues that the legislative history of a proposed Senate bill supports its position that the railroads may only be compensated for avoidable costs, both service and track, without resort to quality of service criteria. The Senate Commerce Committee originally reported out a bill that would subsidize railroad passenger service. The subsidies were not to exceed \u201cavoidable costs, less revenues.\u201d S. 3706, 91st Cong., 2d Sess., \u00a7 202(a), S.Rep. No. 91-765 at 21. On the floor of the Senate, however, the proposed subsidy bill was replaced in its entirety by the bill to establish a nationwide railroad corporation, 116 Cong.Rec. 14160 (1970), that was later enacted, virtually without change, as the 1970 Act. 116 Cong.Rec. 36894 (1970). The new bill contained no mention of \u201cavoidable costs.\u201d Absent clear legislative history to support Amtrak\u2019s contention that the framers of the 1970 Act explicitly embraced S. 3706\u2019s \u201cavoidable cost\u201d language, we decline the invitation to assume that the payment scheme designed to govern a subsidy program necessarily would govern the payments of a for-profit corporation. <em>See </em>section 301 of the 1970 Act, 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 541 (1976).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b942-13\">. <em>See </em>note 6 <em>supra </em>for text of section 10(1) of the 1973 Act.
