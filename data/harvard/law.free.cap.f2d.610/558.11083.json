Gelley, trustee for the heirs of Richard Lawrence Gelley, appeals the order of the district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> dismissing this wrongful death action for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6), respectively. Gelley argues that because the complaint states an actionable claim for negligence against a private person under Minnesota law, she may bring this action against the United States of America under the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA), 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1346(b) and 2671-2680. Gelley also asserts that no FTCA exception applies to exclude the government from liability. We disagree and hold that the complaint fails to state a cause of action cognizable under Minnesota law. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-14\">The trial court adequately summarized the essential facts as pleaded and Gelley\u2019s theory of recovery:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-15\">Richard Gelley, plaintiff\u2019s decedent, died in 1973, allegedly as a result of an adverse reaction to lidocaine hydrochoride (trade name xylocaine), a local anesthetic drug manufactured by defendant Astra Pharmaceutical Products, Inc. [hereinafter Astra]. The xylocaine was administered to plaintiff\u2019s decedent by Dr. Jerry K. Brunsoman, who was associated with defendant MacKay &amp; Fuller D.D.S. Professional Association. The United States Food and Drug Administration [hereinafter FDA], an agency of the Department of Health, Education and Welfare, had previously found xylocaine \u201csafe for use\u201d and approved the introduction of the drug into interstate commerce.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-16\">This wrongful death action was instituted by plaintiff Carol Gelley, as trustee for the heirs of Richard Gelley, in this Court in 1974. The plaintiff\u2019s complaint alleges that FDA personnel, as well as the other defendants, were negligent, that some defendants are liable on a strict liability theory, and that defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>Astra is independently Hable because it violated the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 301, <em>et seq. </em>Plaintiff has filed a \u201cprotective\u201d action in the Ramsey County District Court against the same parties, except for the United States. * * * Generally, plaintiff\u2019s theory of liability against the government is that the FDA negligently failed to withdraw its prior approval of xylocaine and negligently failed to enforce the provisions of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and its own regulations relating to information collection and labeling changes, thereby allowing xylocaine to remain in interstate commerce in a misbranded and/or adulterated condition. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 351, 352. <em>[Gelley v. Astra Pharmaceutical Products, Inc., </em>466 F.Supp. 182, 184-85 (D.Minn.1979) (footnote omitted) (hereinafter <em>Gelley v. </em>Astra).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">Appellant claims the right to sue the Government under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1346(b) and 2674.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Under those sections, governmental liability turns on whether a private person under like circumstances would incur liability to the claimant \u201cin accordance with the law of the place where the act or omission occurred.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346(b). The district court applied the law of the District of Columbia in dismissing the action;</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-6\">As the law of the place where the act or omission occurred is the focal point with respect to whether liability .may be imposed under the Act, the law of the District of Columbia governs the immediate question of whether the government, if a private individual, would be liable under like circumstances. <em>Richards v. United States, </em>369 U.S. 1, 82 S.Ct. 585, 7 L.Ed.2d 492 (1962). <em>[Gelley v. Astra, supra, </em>466 F.Supp. at 185 (footnote omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b632-7\">The district court, however, did not rely specifically on any cases arising in the District of Columbia. Rather, the court determined that under general tort law principles no right of recovery exists in the District of Columbia or elsewhere for an action against a private party similar in nature to Gelley\u2019s complaint. The district court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-12\">The law of the District of Columbia does not impose a tort duty on private persons to perform activities required by the FDA regulatory scheme. Regulatory activity engaged in by FDA personnel simply has no counterpart in private activity and thus cannot give rise to liability under the common law of the District of Columbia or elsewhere. Therefore, as the law of the place where the act or omission occurred would not impose a duty upon a private person under these circumstances, FDA personnel similarly owed no actionable tort duty to the plaintiff\u2019s decedent. <em>Davis v. United States, </em>536 F.2d 758 (8th Cir. 1976); <em>Devlin Lumber &amp; Supply Corp. v. United States, </em>488 F.2d 88 (4th Cir. 1973); <em>In re Franklin National Bank Securities Litigation, 445 </em>F.Supp. 723 (E.D.N.Y.1978). <em>[Gelley v. Astra, supra, </em>466 F.Supp. at 185-86.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b632-13\">Gelley correctly observes that under the FTCA the whole law of the place where the act or omission occurred becomes applicable, including its conflict of law principles. <em>See Richards v. United States, </em>369 U.S. 1, 82 S.Ct. 585, 7 L.Ed.2d 492 (1962). Noting that the bulk of the FDA activity addressed in the complaint occurred in the District of Columbia, Gelley contends that the District, applying its conflicts principles, would look to Minnesota law to determine whether Gelley\u2019s complaint states a cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-14\">The District of Columbia has adopted an \u201cinterest analysis\u201d approach to resolv<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>ing conflict of law questions. <em>See Semler v. Psychiatric Institute of Washington, D. C., </em>188 U.S.App.D.C. 41, 575 F.2d 922 (D.C.Cir. 1978); <em>Gaither v. Myers, </em>131 U.S.App.D.C. 216, 404 F.2d 216 (D.C.Cir.1968). The District of Columbia Circuit describes the interest analysis as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-5\">Simply stated, the method of governmental interest analysis is (1) to identify the state policies underlying each law in conflict, and (2) to decide which state\u2019s policy would be advanced by having its law applied to the facts at bar. <em>[Semler v. Psychiatric Institute, supra, </em>188 U.S.App. D.C. at 43, 575 F.2d at 924 (footnote omitted).]<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">We assume, without deciding, that under the interest analysis approach the District of Columbia would apply the substantive law of Minnesota.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> That assumption, however, does not aid Gelley\u2019s cause. Minnesota recognizes no private cause of action for violations of governmental duties owed the public in general, similar to those duties performed by the FDA. <em>Cracraft v. City of St. Louis Park, </em>279 N.W.2d 801 (Minn.1979).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b633-7\">In <em>Cracraft, </em>a municipal fire inspector conducted a fire inspection on school premises as required by municipal ordinance. The inspector failed to notice a highly flammable liquid stored in drums on the school dock. Subsequently the drums of liquid exploded, causing injuries and death to school students. Parents of these children brought actions against the municipality, seeking damages for injuries or wrongful death. They alleged that the city fire inspector failed in his duty of due care in making the inspection.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-8\">The Minnesota Supreme Court sustained the summary dismissal of the suit, holding that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-9\">a municipality does not owe any individual a duty of care merely by the fact that it enacts a general ordinance requiring fire code inspections or by the fact that it undertakes an inspection for fire code violations. A duty of care arises only when there are additional indicia that the municipality has undertaken the responsibility of not only protecting itself, but also undertaken the responsibility of protecting a particular class of persons from the risks associated with fire code violations. <em>[Id. </em>at 806.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b633-14\">The Minnesota court elaborated on the indi-cia needed to impose liability:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-15\">At what point, then, does the municipality assume to act for the protection of others as distinguished from acting merely for itself when it inspects the activities of third parties for fire code violations? There is no bright line. But, without intending to be exhaustive, there are at least four factors which should be considered. First, actual knowledge of the dangerous condition is a factor which tends to impose a duty of care on the municipality. Second, reasonable reliance by persons on the municipality\u2019s representations and conduct tends to impose a duty of care. Of course, reliance on the inspection in general is not sufficient. Instead, the reasonable reliance must be based on specific actions or representations which cause the persons to forego other alternatives of protecting themselves. Third, a duty of care may be created by an ordinance or statute that sets forth mandatory acts clearly for the protection of a particular class of persons rather than the public as a whole. Finally, the municipality must use due care to avoid increasing the risk of harm. <em>[Id. </em>at 806-07 (footnotes omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b633-16\">We note that Minnesota treats municipalities as private persons in negligence cases. <em>Cracraft v. City of St. Louis Park, supra, </em>279 N.W.2d at 804-06. The Minnesota Supreme Court observed that its holding the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>municipality not liable for negligent inspection is consistent with the common law rule that generally no duty exists to prevent the misconduct of a third person.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The fact that municipalities are treated the same as private persons under Minnesota law makes the <em>Cracraft </em>case crucially important in assessing Gelley\u2019s contention that the complaint states a cause of action under the FTCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-4\">Appellant, however, cites <em>Lorshbough v. Township of Buzzle, </em>258 N.W.2d 96 (Minn. 1977), contending that under Minnesota law a governmental body incurs liability for the failure of its employees to comply with a regulation. The <em>Cracraft </em>court rejected application of <em>Lorshbough </em>to the circumstances present in <em>Cracraft, </em>observing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-5\">Nor are we concerned with the duty of a municipality to comply with its own safety codes as we were in <em>Lorshbough </em>v. <em>Township of Buzzle, </em>258 N.W.2d 96 (Minn.1977). These duties to comply with the law are analogous to those owed by private persons, and a breach of such duties can be the basis of a lawsuit against the municipality just as it can be the basis of a lawsuit against private tortfeasors. We are, instead, considering the municipality\u2019s unique duty to enforce the law by taking steps to assure that third persons comply with the law. <em>[Id. </em>at 803.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">Applying standards set forth in <em>Cracraft, </em>we conclude that the elements necessary to impose liability under Minnesota law do not exist under appellant\u2019s theory of governmental liability asserted in the complaint \u2014 namely, that the FDA failed to insure Astra\u2019s fullest compliance with applicable statutes and regulations regarding adverse drug reaction reporting, advertising and promotion of the drug.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-7\">First, appellant does not, and could not, claim that FDA officials knew that Mr. Gelley would suffer an adverse reaction to the drug. Second, appellant makes no claim that the decedent relied on specific actions or representations of the FDA as an assurance of safety. Third, although appellant alleges that Minn.Stat. \u00a7 151.36 (1978) would create a duty on the part of one acting as the FDA did in this case, that statute merely defines drug misbranding. The Government\u2019s alleged negligence lies in allowing the company to market an allegedly misbranded drug. Moreover, the statute cited by appellant does not set forth \u201cmandatory acts clearly for the protection of a particular class of persons rather than the public as a whole.\u201d <em>Cracraft, supra, </em>279 N.W.2d at 807. Fourth and finally, any failure of the FDA to furnish the public full information concerning xylocaine, an allegedly \u201cmisbranded\u201d and \u201cdangerous\u201d drug, would not <em>increase </em>the hazards presented by that already marketed product.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-11\">Having considered the principles announced by the Minnesota Supreme Court in <em>Cracraft, we </em>reject Gelley\u2019s contention that the complaint in this case states a claim cognizable under Minnesota law. Assuming that that law is applicable under the FTCA, the complaint fails to state a cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-12\">Appellant maintains that a duty of care arose under the federal Food, Drug &amp; Cosmetic Act, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 301 <em>et seq. </em>(1976). However, that Act aims to protect the general public, not any particular class of persons. Moreover, federally imposed obligations, whether general or specific, are irrelevant to our inquiry under the FTCA, unless state law imposes a similar obligation upon private persons. <em>See Zabala Clemente v. United States, </em>567 F.2d 1140, 1149-50 (1st Cir. 1977), <em>cert. denied, </em>435 U.S. 1006, 98 S.Ct. 1876, 56 L.Ed.2d 388 (1978); <em>Davis v. United States, </em>536 F.2d 758 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>(8th Cir. 1976); <em>Devlin Lumber &amp; Supply Corp. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>488 F.2d 88 (4th Cir. 1973); <em>United States v. Smith, </em>324 F.2d 622, 624-25 (5th Cir. 1963); <em>In re Franklin National Bank Securities Litigation, </em>445 F.Supp. 723 (E.D.N.Y.1978). As the district court noted, substantial doubt exists whether tort law principles in any state would hold a private person liable for conduct similar to that of the FDA in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">Finally, as a further bar to appellant\u2019s claim under the FTCA, we agree with the district court\u2019s determination that the \u201cdiscretionary function\u201d exception, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2680(a) (1976), also applies. <em>See First National Bank in Albuquerque v. United States, </em>552 F.2d 370 (10th Cir. 1977); <em>Gray v. United States, </em>445 F.Supp. 337 (S.D. Tex.1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">Thus, the district court properly dismissed the action against the United States. With the Government out of the lawsuit, no basis exists to assert federal jurisdiction over the other defendants. Accordingly, we affirm the dismissal of the action as against all parties. With respect to the nongovernmental defendants, we stress that our dismissal rests on jurisdictional grounds, not the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b631-17\">. <em>Gelley v.
