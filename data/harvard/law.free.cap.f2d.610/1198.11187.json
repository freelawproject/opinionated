Griffin, individually and as executrix of her husband\u2019s estate, sought, in a diversity action, injunctive relief and mone<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1200\">*1200</page-number>tary damages for the blocking by a neighboring landowner of an easement of ingress and egress. The district court declined to grant equitable relief because there had been no sufficient showing of intentional and willful invasion by defendant of plaintiff\u2019s right-of-way or easement. While recognizing that the plaintiff was entitled to some damages for the violation of her rights, the district judge granted a motion to dismiss because actual damages proven did not amount to the jurisdictional requisite sum (an amount in excess of $10,000) under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332(a) and the basis for an award of punitive damages had not been made out.</p>\n<p id=\"b1272-4\">There is little dispute as to the facts. The Griffins in 1965, by deed recorded among the land records of Garrett County, Maryland, purchased several lots, aggregating in all less than one acre, fronting on Deep Creek Lake. The 1965 deed also conveyed all rights of the grantors \u201cto use in perpetuity as a means of outlet from and as an access to said lots, the existing roads leading therefrom in a Northwesterly and Southwesterly direction to the road\u2019s intersection with the county road . . . \u201d. The defendant in 1972 purchased and subsequently developed a substantially larger parcel in the vicinity of the Griffins\u2019 lots. The parcel was one over which the easement of ingress and egress ran.</p>\n<p id=\"b1272-6\">Prior to the spring of 1975 the Griffins and others improved and made use of the existing road across defendant\u2019s parcel.</p>\n<p id=\"b1272-7\">Development plans of the defendant included the placement of tennis courts across the existing road and the construction in different locations of a road or roads to accommodate traffic previously utilizing the way of ingress and egress of the plaintiff. In the spring of 1975, the tennis courts and some related banks were constructed by defendant, effectively preventing use of the Griffins\u2019 right-of-way. They first learned of the obstruction on the Memorial Day weekend in 1975. Prior to learning of the obstruction, they were never consulted by the defendant nor did they ever agree to a relocation of their existing easement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1272-8\">\n<em>Injunctive Relief</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1272-9\">Without disputing that its actions had infringed on rights of the Griffins, the defendant opposed the requested equitable relief of a mandatory injunction to restore and reopen the right-of-way on the grounds that its actions had not constituted a willful interference with the plaintiffs\u2019 rights. In that connection, defendant\u2019s president testified that he checked with the defendant\u2019s attorney, asked him if it was legal to put a road in, and received advice that it was legal to do so. He further testified that the primary purpose in changing the road was to eliminate a road that was unsightly, to make a recreation area, to beautify the area, and to give better access generally to those in the vicinity.</p>\n<p id=\"b1272-10\">On the basis of the testimony that there had been reliance on legal advice, the district judge concluded that the action of destroying Griffins\u2019 easement was not shown to be willful and determined that injunctive relief should not be granted, but that the plaintiff should be restricted to an action for damages. It appears that Judge Young was applying the doctrine of comparative hardship as evolved in the cases of <em>Lichtenberg v. Sachs, </em>213 Md. 147, 131 A.2d 264 (1957), <em>Lichtenberg v. Sachs, </em>200 Md. 145, 88 A.2d 450 (1952), <em>Easter v. Dundalk Holding Co., </em>199 Md. 303, 86 A.2d 404 (1952), and <em>Dundalk Holding Co. v. Easter, </em>215 Md. 549, 137 A.2d 667 (1958), <em>cert. denied, </em>358 U.S. 821, 79 S.Ct. 34, 3 L.Ed.2d 62 (1958), <em>reh\u2019g denied, </em>358 U.S. 901, 79 S.Ct. 219, 3 L.Ed.2d 151 (1958). However, the circumstances which those cases suggest may permit application of the doctrine of comparative hardship to deny injunctive relief come nowhere near the circumstances in the present case. <em>Easter </em>involved a situation in which an adjoining landowner, on constructing a building, innocently, in reliance on an independent surveyor\u2019s location of the boundary, encroached upon his neighbor\u2019s land. The encroachment was less than one foot. It did not materially interfere with the enjoyment by the neighbor of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1201\">*1201</page-number>his rights in his land. The neighbor in an earlier case, <em>Dundalk Holding Co. v. Easter, </em>195 Md. 488, 73 A.2d 877 (1950), had obtained a judgment in an action of ejectment, which was affirmed by the Maryland Court of Appeals. In <em>Easter v. Dundalk Holding Co., </em>199 Md. 303, 86 A.2d 404 (1952), the encroacher sought, but was denied equitable relief from enforcement of the judgment at law. By way of dictum, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1273-5\">\u201cThus it is an accepted rule that where a landowner, by innocent mistake, erects a building which encroaches on adjoining land, and an injunction is sought by the owner of the land encroached upon, the court will balance the benefit of an injunction to the complainant against the inconvenience and damage to the defendant, and where the occupation does no damage to the complainant except the mere occupancy of a comparatively insignificant part of his lot, or the building does not interfere with the value or use of the rest of his lot, the court may decline to order the removal of the building and leave the adjoining landowner to his remedy at law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1273-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 305, 86 A.2d at 405. Then, in <em>Dundalk Holding Co. v. Easter, </em>215 Md. 549, 556, 137 A.2d 667, 671 (1958), <em>cert. denied, </em>358 U.S. 821, 79 S.Ct. 34 (1958), <em>reh\u2019g denied, </em>358 U.S. 901, 79 S.Ct. 219, 3 L.Ed.2d 151 (1958), the court relieved the encroacher of the onerous responsibility of removing the encroachment, on the grounds that he would be unduly penalized:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1273-7\">\u201cFirmly established are the doctrine of comparative hardship and the right to refuse a mandatory injunction to the invaded owner, if the mistake is innocent and the damages to the offender tip the equitable scales unduly against him because the invasion and the benefit to the injured owner are slight.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1273-8\">In the first <em>Lichtenberg </em>case, the plaintiff sought and obtained an injunction against a landowner\u2019s interference with the use by the plaintiff of a right-of-way as laid out from the plaintiff\u2019s land through certain land of the landowner. In the second <em>Lichtenberg </em>case, it appeared that the unsuccessful landowner had ignored the injunction and had proceeded to develop the land, constructing two houses encroaching on the right of way, each by about one foot, leaving the right-of-way passable and a third house which totally blocked the right of ingress and egress. The landowner then sought a declaratory decree that the doctrine of comparative hardship should be applied to preclude equitable relief in the way of removal of the obstruction. The court emphasized that the doctrine of comparative hardship only applies where it is established by the violator of the easement that his action was no more than an innocent mistake. The court pointed out that constitutional principles would preclude a decision that one landowner could, in the interests of improving his own property, require the adjoining landowner to surrender a specific right-of-way in return for relocation elsewhere and for appropriate monetary compensation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1273-10\">\u201cThey now request this Court to require that the defendant submit to a relocation of the right of way, and accept consequent damages for its relocation. Even if this Court were inclined, under the above circumstances, to grant such relief, it has no authority to do so. There are constitutional barriers that definitely prevent its granting. The request that the plaintiffs be allowed to relocate the defendant\u2019s right of way and permitted to pay him damages for such relocation amounts to a request that private property be taken for private use. No court has authority to compel the owner of land to surrender his property to another person, lacking the power of eminent domain, in exchange for a sum of money, because, the taking of one person\u2019s property for the private use of another, even with full compensation, is a deprivation of property without due process of law in violation of Article 23 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights and the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1273-11\">213 Md. at 152, 131 A.2d at 266-67.</p>\n<p id=\"b1273-12\">In <em>Hanley v. Stulman, </em>216 Md. 461, 141 A.2d 167 (1958), the Maryland Court of Ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1202\">*1202</page-number>peals again blocked an effort by a developer to relocate an inconvenient easement over the opposition of the easement owner. A contention of \u201cundue hardship\u201d was given short shrift. The subject was again before the Court of Appeals in <em>Columbia Hills Corp. v. Mercantile-Safe Deposit &amp; Trust Co., </em>231 Md. 379, 382, 190 A.2d 635, 638 (1963). The easement involved was by grant; however recordation was delayed and in the interim the owner of the servient property substituted a new entrance onto a busy highway for the one provided for in the easement grant. The Court first recognized that, had the instrument granting the easement been timely recorded, it would have constituted constructive notice under Annotated Code of Maryland, (1957) Art. 21, \u00a7 l.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> It went on to uphold the lower court\u2019s finding that the failure to record was immaterial since the servient owner\u2019s officers had actual notice of the physical existence of the easement, \u201cso as to put the appellant on inquiry as to the rights of the appellee, and were charged with notice of such rights\u201d. The court then disposed summarily of \u201cthe contention that the injunction subjects appellant to great injury and affords appellee comparatively little benefit\u201d, saying: \u201cHowever, all that does not change the fact that in both instances there was an attempted unconstitutional taking of property by a private person for private purposes\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b1274-4\">Once again, in the recent case of <em>Amabile v. Winkles, </em>276 Md. 234, 347 A.2d 212 (1975)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the highest Maryland court refused to apply the doctrine of comparative hardship when asked by the owner of the ser-vient estate to do so. There, the right-of-way was blocked by construction of an apartment house. The finding of the Chancellor that construction of the apartment house \u201cwas not the result of an innocent mistake\u201d was deemed dispositive. The Maryland Court of Appeals stated: \u201cThe key words are \u2018innocent mistake.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 242, 347 A.2d at 216.</p>\n<p id=\"b1274-9\">To say that the action of the defendant here was \u201cnot willful\u201d is not the same as saying it was \u201cinnocent\u201d. In the first place, it should be observed that a test of \u201cnon-willfulness\u201d, because of the emphasis introduced by the negative \u201cnot\u201d or \u201cnon\u201d naturally leads to the placing of the burden on the easement holder, which is where Judge Young placed it here. Instinctively, we feel that the burden should fall on the party who must prove the positive. Requiring proof of a negative is something we shun. If the test, on the other hand, is \u201cinnocent\u201d, the burden more naturally rests with the person who has obstructed the easement.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1274-10\">In the second place, the two terms \u201cnon-willfulness\u201d and \u201cinnocence\u201d do not have precisely the same connotation. Something may be non-willful without being innocent. The present case affords a good example of the difference. To establish \u201cinnocence\u201d defendant would have to show it reasonably had no notice of the Griffins\u2019 rights, or that, with knowledge of those rights, it made a good faith effort to locate an improved road exactly on the path of the easement, but strayed from that path because of a good faith error by an independent surveyor as to the boundaries of the easement. On the other hand, non-willfulness might be established if defendant proved that, while it knew of plaintiff\u2019s rights, it honestly, if erroneously, felt that it was justified in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1203\">*1203</page-number>making a slight alteration in the easement\u2019s course to accommodate important objectives of defendant. Yet that would not prove \u201cinnocence\u201d. Nor, under Maryland law, would it permit application of the doctrine of comparative hardship.</p>\n<p id=\"b1275-5\">Furthermore, even with \u201cinnocence\u201d proven, defendant would not necessarily be home. The Maryland cases indicate that, in addition to innocence, there must be proof that interference with the enjoyment by the holder of the easement of his rights was merely slight, leaving enjoyment of the rights essentially unimpaired. Under the cases, if the tennis courts built by defendant had impinged by a foot on the easement, leaving it still passable, the \u201cde min-imis\u201d requirement for application of the doctrine of comparative hardship might be met. Here, however, the utility of the easement was totally destroyed. Substitution of something just as good or better would, arguably, render the value of the easement right, in its totality, slight. It would not, however, establish what the cases require: proof that interference with the right was minimal. Slight interference with a right is not the equal of total interference with a slight right. The law protects one\u2019s enjoyment of one\u2019s rights, both great and small, and lack of value in the eyes of others is not what counts. The owner is entitled to value the right differently.</p>\n<p id=\"b1275-6\">Because he applied the wrong test for determining whether the doctrine of comparative hardship could have any pertinence, we vacate and remand for a further consideration by Judge Young. To aid him in his consideration of the matter, we suggest that he give consideration to the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b1275-7\">1. The constructive notice with which defendant was charged under the Maryland recordation statute may prove an insuperable obstacle to the establishment of innocence. A relevant question would be whether defendant, on purchasing the ser-vient property, obtained a title search, and, if so, whether it disclosed the easement. Failure of a developer to pursue so commonplace and prudent a course would hardly be compatible with innocence. Even if a title report were obtained, and failed to disclose the easement, constructive notice of the deed would still exist, and the significance of the defective title report here might be small, though perhaps it might create rights of defendant over against the preparer of the title report.</p>\n<p id=\"b1275-9\">2. The easement was evidently plainly visible to defendant before it was obstructed. Defendant\u2019s purpose was, in part, to eliminate a road that was unsightly. <em>Columbia Hills Corp. v. Mercantile-Safe Deposit &amp; Trust Co., supra, </em>would seem therefore, to require a grant of injunctive relief to plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b1275-10\">3. The reliance on counsel\u2019s advice in the present case seems to afford no evidence of innocence. The advice did not even concern the question of whether the defendant had the right to obstruct the easement. According to defendant\u2019s president \u201cI asked him if it was legal for us to put a road in there, and he said it was\u201d. Obviously the defendant could put in as many additional roads on its property as it wished, so long as it did not interfere with the use of the existing road by plaintiff. Hence, the legal advice sought and received was irrelevant to the issue here posed. To approve the putting in of one road is not to condone the knocking out of another.</p>\n<p id=\"b1275-11\">Even if on remand it develops that the legal advice in fact addressed the issue of whether the plaintiff\u2019s easement could be completely obstructed, we are doubtful that such advice could have helped establish \u201cinnocence\u201d. Reliance on an attorney\u2019s advice is normally available to negate willful wrongdoing only where the advice has been based on a full disclosure of relevant facts. As a minimum, the proof needed to establish such a basis would also necessarily have to establish actual notice to and actual knowledge by defendant of the easement prior to the actions which blocked it. <em>Columbia Hills Corp. v. Mercantile-Safe Deposit &amp; Trust Co., supra, </em>would then seem dispositive. The attorney whose advice was sought was not called as a witness, so the basis of any advice he may have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1204\">*1204</page-number>given is not established. The existence of the plaintiff\u2019s easement is so clear from the documents and the rule that one may not block an easement even if one provides a \u201cbetter alternative route\u201d is so firmly established that it seems improbable to the point of near impossibility that any sound advice based on a fair disclosure of the facts could have been given to the effect that the easement could have been blocked.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1276-4\">In that connection, the district judge, on remand, should give consideration to the statement contained in the affidavit of the defendant\u2019s president dated July 24, 1976 and repeated in the proposed pretrial order of June 17, 1978:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1276-5\">\u201cThat all of the lot owners from the original subdivision were contacted personally, including Stanley R. Griffin, and all have expressed satisfaction and approval of the new access road, except Stanley R. Griffin, whereupon Red Run Lodge, Inc. offered to improve the Griffin driveway in any manner he choose, either by regrading the same or by providing a new entrance at a different location, all of which he refused.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1276-6\">That statement is not explicit as to whether the contact with lot owners was prior or subsequent to the building of the tennis courts. If, indeed, it was prior thereto, a finding of innocence would seem foreclosed regardless of other considerations. The fact that defendant felt it necessary to make such contacts would demonstrate an awareness of the rights of the lot owners, including the Griffins.</p>\n<p id=\"b1276-7\">\n<em>Damages</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1276-8\">The trial of plaintiff\u2019s claim for damages proceeded before a jury. At the conclusion of the evidence, defendant moved to dismiss on the grounds that (a) actual damages proven were substantially less than $10,000 and (b) no sufficient evidence of malicious behavior had been shown to sustain any award for punitive damages. Defendant asserted that the jurisdictional amount of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332(a) was not met. Plaintiff\u2019s counsel resisted the motion simply on the grounds that there was evidence to support a verdict in excess of $10,000. Hearing no other reasons and expressing a regret at the result since he regarded the plaintiff as entitled to some damages for the invasion of her rights, Judge Young granted defendant\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1276-11\">In doing so, he committed plain and prejudicial error. It is well established that where a plaintiff joins several claims against a defendant, and one of them satisfies the jurisdictional amount requirement, jurisdiction is present for all counts, including those for which the amount in controversy is patently less than $10,000. Even if no single claim is for an amount in excess of $10,000, if the aggregate amount of all claims is in excess of $10,000, jurisdiction exists for each count. <em>Stone v. Stone, </em>405 F.2d 94 (4th Cir. 1968); 1 Moore\u2019s <em>Federal Practice, </em>\u00b6 0.97; 6 Wright and Miller, <em>Federal Practice and Procedure, </em>\u00a7 1588.</p>\n<p id=\"b1276-12\">Once jurisdiction exists, subsequent events, such as the determination that one of the aggregated claims was without merit, do not destroy the jurisdictional basis to dispose, on the merits, of claims- of $10,000 or less. <em>St. Paul Mercury Indemnity Co. v. Red Cab Co., </em>303 U.S. 283, 289-90, 58 S.Ct. 586, 82 L.Ed. 845 (1938); <em>Lynch v. Porter, </em>446 F.2d 225, 228 (8th Cir. 1971); <em>Stewart v. Shanahan, </em>277 F.2d 233, 236 (8th Cir. 1960); 1 Moore\u2019s <em>Federal Practice, </em>\u00b6 0.91[3].</p>\n<p id=\"b1276-13\">In the present case, there was no insufficiency as to jurisdictional amount with respect to the request for injunctive relief. Judge Young dealt with it on the merits. He did not dismiss it for lack of jurisdiction. Nor, given the substantial na<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1205\">*1205</page-number>ture of the actions taken by the defendant in blocking plaintiff\u2019s right-of-way and the obvious extensive expense which would be involved in restoring the right-of-way, could it reasonably have been held that plaintiff\u2019s statement in the complaint and amended complaint that the amount in controversy exceeds the sum of $10,000 should be questioned as lacking in good faith. <em>Horton v. Liberty Mutual Ins. Co., </em>367 U.S. 348, 353, 81 S.Ct. 1570, 6 L.Ed.2d 890 (1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b1277-5\">In <em>T.S.C. Motor Freight Lines v. Leonard Truck Lines, Inc., </em>4 F.R.D. 366, 367 (W.D.La. 1945), plaintiff lost on the merits in a suit for specific performance. The court discussed the jurisdictional consequences had there been an alternate demand for damages less in amount than the jurisdictional limit and stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1277-6\">\u201cIf the suit for specific performance was filed in good faith and the value in controversy was sufficient to support jurisdiction, then the fact that the alternative demand of damages was for less than $3,000 would have made no difference.\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1277-7\">Although the grounds for jurisdiction of the damages claim here indicated were not put forward by the plaintiff below, it is appropriate for this Court to call attention to it on its own, especially since the matter must be remanded for other reasons. <em>See Stone v. Stone, supra, </em>at p. 96, where aggregation of claims was relied on to establish jurisdiction \u201calthough neither in the District Court nor on appeal did the parties advert to the question of joinder . \u201d. Here, also, the controlling consideration, was not referred to, and, as a consequence, the court was led into error. On remand, plaintiff should be permitted to recover any damages to which she is entitled regardless of the fact that the maximum recoverable amount is $10,000 or less.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1277-9\">With regard to any trial of the damages issue, in light of what has been set forth in this opinion, plaintiff may press again her claim for punitive damages. With respect to it, the district judge should consider whether, regardless of plaintiff\u2019s right to trial by jury of the issue,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1206\">*1206</page-number>Maryland substantive law punitive damages are recoverable at all. Having requested injunctive relief, plaintiff may have waived any claim to punitive damages. If her action is analogized to a suit at equity, she surely has done so. <em>Superior Construction Co. v. Elmo, </em>204 Md. 1, 102 A.2d 739 (1954). If she is deemed to have pursued a legal remedy, with the prayer for injunctive relief secondary, she still may have waived a claim to punitive damages. <em>See Turner </em>v. <em>Washington Suburban Sanitary Commission, </em>221 Md. 494, 506, 158 A.2d 125, 131-32 (1960) where the possibility was pointed out, but resolution of the question was left open. Should the plaintiff seek to introduce evidence sufficient to establish malice which would support an award of punitive damages, the district judge will doubtless have to decide whether there has been, in the circumstances of this case, a waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b1278-4\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1274-5\">.

All this merely illustrates how much we are guided by the sounds of words, not pausing always to ponder their exact meanings. \u201cInnocent\u201d literally derives from the combination of two words signifying \u201cnot harmful\u201d. Yet its \u201cnegative\u201d characteristic has been submerged.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1276-9\">. The economics of situations such as the present one, where developers might have much to gain or lose by the opinion expressed, make us reluctant to accept a conclusion that a property owner, clearly barred from disturbing an easement across his land, can better his position by getting a legal opinion, faulty in its conclusion, that he may destroy the rights of the easement holder. It is not desirable to extend the rule which makes a lawyer\u2019s opinion evidence of non-willfulness for purposes of determining degree of guilt or liability to permit a lawyer to confer a positive benefit on his client by giving incorrect advice.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1277-10\">. To overcome the inevitable conclusion that there was jurisdiction because of the claim for an injunction, defendant might assert that plaintiff never properly made a claim for in-junctive relief, since none was explicitly spelled out in the initial complaint, and plaintiffs two efforts to amend (one in May 1977, the other in June 1978) to add a precise prayer for an injunction were both denied, since filed on eve of trial. (Evidently the trial anticipated for May 1977 was postponed.) However, such an assertion would fail because:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1277-11\">a.

The proposed pretrial order jointly presented by the parties on the first day of trial, signed by their counsel (although not executed by the trial judge) set out that: \u201cPlaintiffs seek injunctive relief for reason that aid of Court is required to force Defendant to restore the right of way to the condition that it was in before Defendant destroyed it\u201d. While defendant objected in the pretrial order to any amendment to the Complaint in view of the imminence of the trial date, it indicated no opposition to plaintiffs\u2019 asserting a right to injunctive relief.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1277-13\">c. The trial judge clearly accepted that the Griffins had asserted a claim for injunctive relief, stating at the conclusion of the evidence: \u201cIn this case, it seems to me quite clear that there is nothing that would justify the equitable relief that you seek,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1277-15\">d. Defendant has not contended that the possibility of injunctive relief was not raised, and, therefore, not before the Court. In its Brief in this Court, on the contrary, defendant argued the merits of the question whether the evidence would permit injunc-tive relief.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1277-16\">. If plaintiff should pursue only her claim for damages, or should the district court, on the basis of additional facts not heretofore adduced, determine that injunctive relief should not be granted, the damages would be measured on the basis of total loss by plaintiff of the easement right. If injunctive relief is granted, the loss should be measured only for the period between the initial blocking of the easement and the time it is restored.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1277-17\">. Distribution of trial functions as between court and jury under state law on the basis of whether the matters are \u201cat law\u201d or \u201cin equity\u201d may not control when a federal court is determining whether a party is entitled to a trial by jury. <em>Dairy Queen, Inc. v. Wood, </em>369 U.S. 469, 82 S.Ct. 894, 8 L.Ed.2d 44 (1962) requires that plaintiff have a jury trial if she requests it on her damages claim regardless of whether she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1206\">*1206</page-number>has proceeded on an equitable basis (primarily pursuing injunctive relief, with the damage claim ancillary thereto) or on a legal basis (declaring for damages, with an injunction additionally requested). However, in diversity cases, the objective since <em>Erie R.R. v. Tompkins, </em>304 U.S. 64, 58 S.Ct. 817, 82 L.Ed. 1188 (1938) has been to achieve the same substantive result regardless of the forum. Availability <em>vel non </em>of punitive damages is clearly a matter of substantive right to be determined by reference to state law. 1A Moore\u2019s <em>Federal Practice </em>\u00b6 0.310, fn. 28; <em>cf.
