Pursuant to section 8(a) of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, 43 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1337(a) (West 1964), the appellant, the Secretary of the Interior, invited bids for the lease. The notice of sale stipulated that \u201c[a]ll royalty bids must be expressed in a percent to a maximum of five decimal places.\u201d <em>See </em>39 Fed.Reg. 31670 (1974). Furthermore, the notice stated that only bids offering a royalty of \u201c12.50 percent or more\u201d would be considered. <em>See Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b359-23\">Under a heading entitled \u201cPercent Royalty Bid Expressed to Maximum of 5 Decimals,\u201d the appellee, Oil and Gas Futures, Inc. of Texas [Oil and Gas Futures], offered a royalty of \u201c73.45689%\u201d in its bid. A competitor, Texas Gas Exploration Corporation [Texas Gas], presented a royalty expressed as \u201c.82165\u201d in its bid. After examining the materials that Texas Gas submitted with its bid, and taking into account the fact that royalty bids were required to exceed 12.50%, the Secretary construed this latter bid to be an offer of a royalty of 82.165% and awarded the lease to Texas Gas. In the district court below, Oil and Gas Futures successfully argued that the Secretary\u2019s construction of Texas Gas\u2019 royalty bid was arbitrary and capricious, and an abuse of discretion. Accordingly, Oil and Gas Futures was awarded judgment in its favor. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>We find it quite incredible that not only was this suit ever brought, but that the appellee convinced the district court that the Secretary abused his discretion by construing \u201c.82165\u201d to be the equivalent of \u201c82.165%.\u201d We are in complete accord with the appellant\u2019s characterization of this quibble:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-4\">[Bjooks intended for scholars in and below the eighth grade do deal with just this question. On page 87 of their treatise entitled <em>Growth in Arithmetic </em>(Revised Edition, Grade Eight) (World Book Co., Yonkers-On Hudson: 1956), John R. Clark and Rolland R. Smith ask the pertinent question: \u201cDo you know how to change a per cent to a decimal?\u201d Assuming a negative response, the authors set forth certain examples of equivalency: 6 <em>per cent </em>means 6 hundredths; so 6% = .06 7V2 <em>per cent </em>means 7\u00bd hundreths;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-5\">7\u00bd% = .07\u00bd <em>or </em>.075 <em>3\u00bc per cent </em>means 3\u00bc hundreths;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-6\">3\u00bc% = .03\u00bc or .0325</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-7\">After inviting the students to study these equivalencies carefully, the authors announce this principle:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-8\">To change a per cent to a decimal, omit the per cent sign and move the decimal point two places to the left.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-9\">The authors then ask their readers to \u201cStudy these examples and see if you can make up a rule for changing decimals to per cents.\u201d The examples given are:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-11\">.06 = 6%</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-12\">.075 = 7.5% = <em>7\u00bd%</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-13\">.0325 = 3.25% = 3\u00bd%</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-14\">.125 = 12\u00bd% = 12.5%</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-15\">And then- the authors set forth this principle:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-16\">To change a decimal to a per cent, move the decimal point two places to the right, and write the per cent sign after the number.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-17\">And so, with this rule in mind, any eighth grader can tell that .82165 = 82.165% (the decimal has been moved two places to the right, and a per cent sign placed after the number), [footnote omitted].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b360-18\">In view of the appellant\u2019s proper use of this higher mathematics and the fact that all bids were required to be in excess of 12.50%, the Secretary\u2019s decision cannot in any conceivable way be characterized as arbitrary and capricious or as an abuse of discretion.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As a result, the judgment of the district court is reversed with instructions to enter judgment in the appellant\u2019s favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-19\">REVERSED</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b360-10\">. The appellee relies on <em>Superior Oil Co. v. Udall, </em>133 U.S.App.D.C. 198, 409 F.2d 1115 (D.C.Cir.1969), to support the judgment in its favor. This reliance is entirely misplaced. In <em>Superior Oil, </em>Union Oil Co. submitted a bid for an oil and gas lease. This bid was the highest, but it failed to comply with the requirement that a bid, to be valid, be signed. The Secretary accepted the bid, however, by relying on an accompanying transmittal letter which was signed but not submitted with the secrecy guaranteed by sealing. The court held that because Union Oil\u2019s bid did not contain a signature as required, the bid was nonresponsive, and that the bid could not be made responsive by the incorporation of extraneous material. Consequently, the Secretary did not have discretion to accept the bid. The factual situation presented by this case is entirely distinguishable. First, the bid submitted by Texas Gas did contain a percentage because, as our examination of basic arithmetic has demonstrated, \u201c.82165\u201d is simply an alternative expression for 82.165%. The bid was thus responsive. Second, the Secretary did not construe Texas Gas\u2019 bid by the use of material not part of the sealed bidding process. Instead in a simple, sensible manner, the Secretary interpreted the figure \u201c.82165\u201d that was contained in the bid.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-22\">The district court found that Texas Gas\u2019 bid was ambiguous and thus engendered confusion inimical to the efficient use of the sealed bidding process. As our mathematical lecture demonstrates, we find no such great ambiguity and uncertainty so as to render the Secretary\u2019s clarifying construction of the bid an abuse of discretion.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
