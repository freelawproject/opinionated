[There being no federal statute of limitations for \u00a7 1981 cases or Title VII cases, the Illinois five year statute applies. <em>Teague v. Caterpillar Tractor Co., </em>566 F.2d 7 (7th Cir. 1977)]. A previous suit charging violation of Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e <em>et seq., </em>was filed on January 9, 1978, more than 180 days after the date of the alleged violation as required by 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(f)(1). This case was voluntarily dismissed by plaintiff on March 8, 1978. He now contends that the \u00a7 1981 action is identical with the voluntarily dismissed Title VII action, and therefore may be resurrected by virtue of \u00a7 24 of the Illinois statute of limitations (83 S.H.A. \u00a7 24a) which provides that \u201cif the action is voluntarily dismissed by the plaintiff . . . then . . . the plaintiff . . . may commence a new action within one year . . . \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b542-18\">The Illinois statute (\u00a7 24a) permits refiling of a voluntarily dismissed action within a year \u201cwhether or not the time limitation for bringing such action expires during the pendency of such suit.\u201d This means that if the time limit expires during the pendency of the suit the plaintiff shall nevertheless be permitted to commence the action within one year from the date of voluntary dismissal; and that if the original time limit did not expire during the pendency of the suit, the plaintiff may bring the action \u201cwithin the remaining period of limitation\u201d originally available.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-19\">But if the limit does not expire during pendency of the dismissed action, but expired before that action was ever filed, \u00a7 24a does not benefit the plaintiff. This construction of the section, plainly indicated by its wording, has been clearly adopted by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>the Illinois Courts. <em>Walters v. City of Ottawa, </em>175 Ill.App. 130, 135 (1912); <em>Meyer v. Dimas, </em>3 Ill.App.2d 117, 120 N.E.2d 571 (1954); <em>Bavel v. Cavaness, </em>12 Ill.App.3rd 633, 637, 299 N.E.2d 435 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">Moreover, the Supreme Court in <em>Johnson v. Ry. Express, </em>421 U.S. 454, 461, 95 S.Ct. 1716, 44 L.Ed.2d 295 (1975), held that the \u00a7 1981 suit and the Title VII suit are separate actions. Even if the contrary view were taken, a \u00a7 1981 action filed on January 9, 1978, when the Title VII action was filed, would have been barred by the five-year statute of limitations, and hence could not have been preserved by voluntary dismissal and revival under \u00a7 24a.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">Accordingly, the Clerk of this Court is directed to enter judgment of affirmance.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
