Defendant entered into a number of subcontracts, including one with plaintiff Man-ganaro Brothers, Inc. When plaintiff\u2019s work was partially completed, County terminated the prime contract, and on learning this, plaintiff ceased work'. Plaintiff sued Gevyn on two grounds, for payment due on work completed, and for anticipated profits on the balance..</p>\n<p id=\"b95-26\">The first aspect has been disposed of. No purpose would be served by detailing the history of the second except to say that the amount of plaintiff\u2019s anticipated future profit has been determined at a bench trial and defendant held liable therefor. Defendant\u2019s appeal revolves around \u00b6 35 of plaintiff\u2019s contract.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-27\">35. In the event that the Owner terminates or cancels the Principal Contract for any cause whatsoever at any time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>after the date hereof, this Subcontract shall likewise be deemed cancelled and terminated. In such event [the Contractor\u2019s liability shall be limited to payment for work done].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b96-4\">Plaintiff says that this provision is not applicable if the cause of County\u2019s termination was Gevyn\u2019s default on the principal contract. To construe \u201cany cause whatsoever\u201d as excluding defendant\u2019s fault would, however, read a significant limitation into language unrestricted on its face, as well as introduce a possibly difficult issue<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> destroying the simplification the parties seemingly intended. In any event, although requested to do so, the court failed to find Gevyn responsible for County\u2019s termination, a failure understandable in the light of the paucity of evidence. The court\u2019s finding for plaintiff was based on its finding that Gev-yn had committed a substantial breach of the subcontract, that the breach had not been waived, and that the breach \u201crendered irrelevant the provisions of Section 35.\u201d We take this last to mean what plaintiff asserts it to mean, that Gevyn lost the right to rely on section 35.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">Defendant\u2019s breach was that it did not keep up the proportionate payments due to plaintiff out of monies received from County. This breach was not waived for the excellent reason that plaintiff was not aware of it until some months after the termination. Our first question, therefore, is the correctness of the court\u2019s ruling that the breach, subsequently discovered, prevented defendant\u2019s reliance on a clause limiting damage. The court made no express finding, but we may assume from the evidence that the breach was intentional. At the same time, it was totally unconnected, causally or otherwise, with County\u2019s termination of the principal contract and the termination of plaintiff\u2019s subcontract.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">We do not agree with the district court. To begin with, defendant\u2019s breach, even though a substantial one, of course did not of itself terminate the contract, but merely gave plaintiff a right to terminate it. Before plaintiff had exercised that right, the termination of the principal contract caused the contract to terminate by reason of \u00b6 35, which was then in full force. It is difficult to say that \u00b6 35 was at once the operative provision and irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-10\">But even had this not been the case, and plaintiff had been the one to terminate by asserting defendant\u2019s breach, the court could not read \u00b6 35 out of the agreement. While plaintiff might have ignored the contract and sued simply in quantum meruit, it did not, but instead sought future profits on agreed-to but unperformed work. The black letter rule is stated in <em>United States v. Zara Contracting Co., </em>2 Cir., 1944, 146 F.2d 606, at 610, \u201c[T]he definite commitment which the plaintiffs have made in Article 5 is one they must stand by so long as they must rely upon their contract . .\u201d Since plaintiff is relying on the contract to recover, the court\u2019s decision to read \u00b6 35 out of the contract could not be made as a ruling of law, but was a result justifiable; if at all, only by interpretation of the contract\u2019s own terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-11\">This may be tested by supposing for the moment that \u00b6 35 had contained a further sentence, \u201cThis provision will apply even if the Contractor was in default on this subcontract.\u201d Obviously, in that case, plaintiff could not claim that defendant\u2019s breach prevented its reliance on the provision. So, here, such a claim can be made only by interpreting \u00b6 35 to contain the opposite of what we have just supposed, viz., an exception to the effect that \u00b6 35 will <em>not </em>apply in case of Gevyn\u2019s default. Plaintiff is back where it started, seeking to read an exception into language absolute on its face.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-12\">It would be peculiarly inappropriate to do this when, under ordinary damage principles, a party cannot, by claiming a breach, recover more than he would have obtained had no breach occurred. In view <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>of the fact that because of the termination of the principal contract, for which defendant was not chargeable, plaintiff never would have been able to realize future profits, there is no reason why it should acquire a windfall from defendant by pointing to an entirely collateral breach on defendant\u2019s part. Supervening impossibility of performance not occasioned by the defendant puts an end to recovery, regardless of defendant\u2019s prior breach. Restatement of the Law of Contracts (1932) \u00a7 457, esp. Comment d; <em>Model Vending, Inc. </em>v. <em>Stanisci, </em>1962, 74 N.J.Super. 12, 180 A.2d 393.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">\n<em>Reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b96-7\">. Interestingly enough, plaintiff observes in its brief, in another connection,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-8\">\u201cA subcontractor is not in a position to prove responsibility for breaches between the general contractor and the owner. The documents and information necessary to that determination are beyond the subcontractor\u2019s reach.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
