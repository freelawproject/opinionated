The promissory note to the Bank executed by Arnold was secured by certain attached duplicate invoices each of which showed on its face the signature of the purchaser with language purporting to acknowledge receipt of merchandise. The invoices and accounts receivable were, in fact, phony; and the signatures of the purported purchasers were forged by Arnold.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-14\">Arnold, the debtor, defaulted on the loan; and First National learned that the accounts receivable did not exist. First National then sought in this action to recover its loss against Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co., the company with whom it carried its banker\u2019s blanket insurance policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-15\">The bank sued the insurance company under \u201cClause E\u201d of that policy. That clause provides indemnity coverage for the bank\u2019s losses for \u201cany credit [extended] on the faith of any securities, documents or other instruments which prove to have been . . . counterfeited or forged as to the signature of any maker,\u201d etc. But the policy did not otherwise cover losses arising simply from fraud or false pretenses, or for false documents or writings which are not \u201ctransferable,\u201d or have no \u201cvalue, in the ordinary course of business.\u201d It expressly excluded such losses.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-18\">We agree with the District Court that the receipts in the form of duplicate invoices were \u201cdocuments\u201d or \u201cwritten instruments\u201d within the meaning of Clause E. The combined instrument in question here \u2014 an invoice which includes a certificate by the purchaser acknowledging delivery \u2014 has sufficient value and transferability in the ordinary course of business to meet the test laid down in Clause E of the policy. See <em>Union Inv. Co. v. Fidelity &amp; Deposit Co., </em>400 F.Supp. 860 (E.D.Mich. 1976), <em>aff\u2019d </em>549 F.2d 1107 (6th Cir. 1977) (certificates of mortgage insurance not having \u201cindependent or intrinsic value\u201d nevertheless are \u201cdocuments\u201d within meaning of Clause E of standard banker\u2019s blanket bond). The receipt portion of the invoices purported to acknowledge debts owed by the purchasers and were valuable evidence of these debts which were subject to transfer. We also agree with the District Court that the only real evidence on the reliance question suggests that First National did, in fact, rely on the invoices and delivery slips <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>in making the loan. There appears to be no evidence to the contrary. We also agree with the District Court that the signatures of the purchasers contained on the duplicate invoices were false and that the duplicate invoices \u201cprove to have been counterfeited or forged as to the signature of the\u201d purchaser.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-4\">Accordingly, the judgment of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
