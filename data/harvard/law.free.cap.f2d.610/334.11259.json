The court below dismissed appellant\u2019s motion without a hearing. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-20\">As the sole basis for his petition for habeas relief, appellant alleges that his privately retained counsel was ineffective in presenting his defense because he failed to move to suppress the fingerprint standard taken following appellant\u2019s arrest and because he failed adequately to investigate the facts of the case. Our review of the record convinces us that counsel was not ineffective under the standard set by <em>Fitzgerald v. Estelle, </em>505 F.2d 1334 (5th Cir. 1974) (en banc), <em>cert. denied, </em>422 U.S. 1011, 95 S.Ct. 2636, 45 L.Ed.2d 675 (1975). Our affirmance of the district court\u2019s dismissal of appellant\u2019s petition does not of itself foreclose appellant from pursuing a future action in state court based on the illegality of his arrest and the use of evidence obtained as a result of that arrest. Of course, we express no opinion on the merits of such an action.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-21\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
