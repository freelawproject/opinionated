Brummett and Lewis Coal Company<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> appeal from judgments below dismissing their claims for damages against the United Mine Workers of America (UMW) under Section 303 of the Labor Management Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 187, as amended.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Lewis Coal Company also appeals from the district court\u2019s dismissal of its state law claims. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b458-7\">This action arises out of a labor dispute that occurred in Morgan and Scott Counties, Tennessee in early 1975. The parties involved in the dispute were plaintiff Lewis Coal Company,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> plaintiff James W. Brum-mett, a coal hauler operating under the incorporated name Southern Belle Trucking Co., Inc. (Southern Belle), and defendant United Mine Workers of America.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-14\">Plaintiff Lewis Coal Company commenced mining operations at the primary site of the dispute in December, 1974. On January 27, 1975, the Company terminated all of its employees, except for mechanics and a few helpers, and temporarily closed down for equipment repairs. The terminated employees, disgruntled by the Company\u2019s actions, contacted UMW representatives and subsequently authorized the UMW to seek to become their bargaining representative.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-15\">On February 3, 1975, a group of former employees began picketing the mine site. A UMW representative reportedly identified himself to Lewis Coal Company\u2019s assistant supervisor and informed him that the former employees had been told that the Company had a new crew and that the pickets were seeing to it that the new crew was not going to work. On this first day of picketing, plaintiff Brummett<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> allegedly was halted at the picket line and informed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>that he, as well as the Company, was being picketed by the UMW. On February 11, 1975, the UMW filed a petition with the N.L.R.B. for certification as the employees\u2019 bargaining representative.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">In late February and early March, 1975, violence, both at and away from the mine site, resulted in unfair labor practice charges being filed against the UMW. In addition, a suit brought by the Company in state court resulted in injunctive relief and subsequent findings of contempt against a number of the more active pickets.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">The Company terminated Brummett\u2019s contract in February or early March, 1975. After Lewis Coal Company terminated him, Brummett hauled coal for other operators until December, 1975. On December 30, 1976, both Brummett and Southern Belle were adjudged bankrupts.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-8\">The picketing continued and the UMW gave the pickets weekly strike benefits from February 3 to July 18, 1975. However, the violence was ended by an April 7, 1975, stipulation between the UMW and the NLRB. In July, the Union abandoned the strike and withdrew its petition for an election. In June, 1976, Lewis Coal Company ceased its mining operations.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b459-17\">On January 30,1978, Brummett and Lewis Coal Company initiated the present action for damages under Section 303. Additionally, plaintiffs sought treble damages under Section 47-15-113, Tenn.Code Ann.,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and punitive damages for alleged violations of Tennessee common law.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-18\">The trial in this case was originally scheduled to commence on June 6, 1978. Pursuant to a pretrial order, the trial was rescheduled to July 25, 1978, with trial briefs and jury charges to be filed on or before June 15, and witness lists to be exchanged by May 10,1978.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Pursuant to the terms of a stipulation entered into by the parties and approved by the court on June 8, 1978, trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>by jury was waived; the parties were ordered to file proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law by July 17, 1978.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b460-4\">On July 14, eleven days prior to trial, plaintiffs filed their pretrial briefs. Three days later, on July 17, the date specified in the court\u2019s order of June 8, plaintiffs filed proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law. On July 18, 1978, the Union filed a motion for summary judgment seeking to dismiss Brummett\u2019s claims on grounds that the right to pursue these claims had vested exclusively in the trustee of Brummett\u2019s bankrupt estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">It appears that plaintiff\u2019s counsel learned of the Union\u2019s motion purely by accident while making inquiry to the clerk on July 19 as to the status of the Union\u2019s overdue pretrial brief and proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law. Upon discovering that the motion and a brief in support thereof had been filed the previous day, plaintiff\u2019s counsel opposed the motion in a telegram delivered to the court on July 20, 1978.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> On that same day, the court entered an order granting the Union\u2019s motion for summary judgment and dismissed Brum-mett as a party plaintiff.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b460-12\">When the cause came on for trial as scheduled on July 25, 1978, the court declined in its discretion to exercise pendent jurisdiction over that portion of the complaint alleging violations of state law. The court, therefore, <em>sua sponte </em>dismissed Lewis Coal Company\u2019s claims arising under the laws of Tennessee. Following the court\u2019s dismissal of its state law claims, Lewis Coal Company requested and was granted a voluntary dismissal without prejudice of its Section 303 claims pursuant to Rule 41(a)(2), F.R.Civ.Pro.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b460-13\">I. Summary Judgment</p>\n<p id=\"AxN\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b460-14\">Brummett contends that the district court acted improperly in granting the Union\u2019s two-day-old motion for summary judgment. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-15\">Summary judgment does serve a worthwhile cause. As the Fourth Circuit has noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-16\">Summary judgment is to avoid a useless trial. It is a device to make possible the prompt disposition of controversies on their merits without a trial, if in essence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>there is no real dispute as to the salient facts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"arn-dedup-0\"><em>Bland v. Norfolk and Southern Railroad Company, </em>406 F.2d 863, 866 (4th Cir. 1969). To facilitate this purpose, Rule 56(b),<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> F.R.Civ.Pro., allows a motion for summary judgment to be made by a defendant at any time. But this Court has often cautioned</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ahd\">that a trial judge should be slow in disposing of a case of any complexity on a motion for summary judgment, that while such a judgment wisely used is a praiseworthy and timesaving device, yet such prompt dispatch of judicial business is neither the sole nor the primary purpose for which courts have been established, and that a party should not be deprived of an adequate opportunity to fully develop his case by witnesses and a trial, when the issues involved make such procedure the appropriate one.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ayj-dedup-0\"><em>S. J. Groves &amp; Sons v. Ohio Turnpike Com., </em>(6th Cir.) 315 F.2d 235, 237, <em>cert. denied, </em>375 U.S. 824, 84 S.Ct. 65, 11 L.Ed.2d 57 (1963). <em>See Smith, et al. v. Hudson, et al., </em>600 F.2d 60 (6th Cir. 1979); <em>Tee-Pak, Inc. v. St. Regis Paper Co., </em>491 F.2d 1193, 1196 (6th Cir. 1974); <em>Hart v. Johnston, </em>389 F.2d 239, 241 (6th Cir. 1968).</p>\n<p id=\"AIB\">Even where otherwise warranted, courts have uniformly held that such motions are inappropriate on the eve of trial. <em>See Williams v. Howard Johnson\u2019s Inc. of Washington, </em>323 F.2d 102 (4th Cir. 1963); <em>Woods v. Robb, </em>171 F.2d 539 (5th Cir. 1948); <em>Clark v. Hancock, </em>45 F.R.D. 512 (S.D.Ga.1968). And where no leave to respond is accorded, the inherent prejudice of a belated motion for summary judgment is even further accentuated. <em>Kistner v. Califano, </em>579 F.2d 1004 (6th Cir. 1978); <em>Bowdidge v. Lehman, </em>252 F.2d 366 (6th Cir. 1958); <em>Ailshire v. Darnell, </em>508 F.2d 526, 528 (8th Cir. 1974); <em>Mustang Fuel Corp. </em>v. <em>Youngstown Sheet &amp; Tube Co., </em>480 F.2d 607 (10th Cir. 1973); <em>Georgia Southern &amp; Florida Ry. v. Atlantic Coast Line R. R., </em>373 F.2d 493 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>389 U.S. 851, 88 S.Ct. 69, 19 L.Ed.2d 120 (1967). <em>See also, Enochs v. Sisson, </em>301 F.2d 125 (5th Cir. 1962); <em>Adams v. Campbell County School District, </em>483 F.2d 1351 (10th Cir. 1971); <em>Macklin v. Butler, </em>553 F.2d 525 (7th Cir. 1977).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AJl\">(b) For Defending Party. A party against whom a claim, counterclaim, or cross-claim is asserted or a declaratory judgment is sought may, at any time, move with or without supporting affidavits for a summary judgment in his favor as to all or any part thereof.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ahv\">In choosing to act as it did on this two-day-old motion for summary judgment, the district court disposed of a complex case without even permitting plaintiffs the benefits of applicable procedural rules. Local Rule 12(b)<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> allows a party five days after a motion is served to respond. And where the motion is determinative of the case on the merits, Local Rule 12(c)<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> provides for an oral hearing upon request by either party. Under rule 56(c), F.R.Civ.Pro.,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> a litigant has a minimum of ten days within which to respond to a motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>In this case, however, the Union\u2019s motion was not served upon Brummett\u2019s counsel until July 20, the same day the district court rendered its decision granting the motion. We are of the view that these precipitous acts by the trial court denied plaintiff his due process right to be heard.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b462-4\">Ordinarily, our finding here would require that we reverse and remand this cause in order that plaintiff might be permitted an opportunity to properly oppose the motion. But as the question presented here is purely one of law, we go on to decide it. And while we do not approve of the district court\u2019s conduct, our review of the pertinent, law persuades us that the error committed here was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">Considering the motion on the merits, the district court held that title to Brummett\u2019s right of action vested exclusively in the trustee of his bankrupt estate under Section 70a(6) of the [old] Bankruptcy Act, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 110a(6), upon his filing of a voluntary petition in bankruptcy.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The court found that Brummett was divested of this cause of action because it arose upon contract or, in the alternative, claimed damages \u201cof general financial ruin which constitutes an injury to his property.\u201d Plaintiff contends that the court committed reversible error. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-9\">Section 70(a)(6) provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b462-10\">110. Title to property, (a) The trustee of the estate of a bankrupt and his successor or successors, if any, upon his or their appointment and qualification, shall in turn be vested by operation of law with the title of the bankrupt as of the date of the filing of the petition initiating a proceeding under this Act [this title], except insofar as it is to property which is held to be exempt, to all of the following kinds of property wherever located . (6) rights of action arising upon contracts, or usury, or the unlawful taking or detention of or injury to his property . . .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b462-12\">The case law in the area suggests that causes of action \u201carising upon contract\u201d within the contemplation of \u00a7 70a(6) involve actions to enforce rights created by virtue and pursuant to the terms of a contract. <em>See Tobin v. Plein, </em>301 F.2d 378 (2nd Cir. 1962); <em>Hudson v. Wylie, </em>242 F.2d 435, 443 (9th Cir. 1957); <em>Moore v. Slonim, </em>426 F.Supp. 524, 526 (D.Conn.), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>562 F.2d 38 (2d Cir. 1977). In other words, causes of action arising upon contract are to enforce the contractual obligations of a party to the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-13\">While the claims asserted by Brummett in this action are to recover for an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>alleged injury to his contractual relationship with Lewis Coal Company, they clearly are not to enforce any rights which he may have had pursuant to a contract. Thus it would appear that to the extent the district court viewed Brummett\u2019s claims as vesting in the trustee because they arose on a contract, the court erred.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-4\">Our disposition of the district court\u2019s first holding requires that we address its holding that Brummett\u2019s claims vested in the trustee because they arose upon an injury to his property. The crucial question here concerns whether Brummett\u2019s contractual relationship with Lewis Coal Company constituted \u201cproperty\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 70a(6). We are guided here by recent Supreme Court precedent. <em>See Kokoszka v. Belford, </em>417 U.S. 642, 94 S.Ct. 2431, 41 L.Ed.2d 374 (1973).<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-5\">In <em>Kokoszka, supra, </em>the Court noted: The term has never been given a precise or universal definition. On an earlier occasion in <em>Segal </em>v. <em>Rochelle, </em>382 U.S. 375 [, 86 S.Ct. 511, 15 L.Ed.2d 428] (1966), the Court noted \u201c \u2018[i]t is impossible to give any categorical definition to the word \u201cproperty,\u201d nor can we attach to it in certain relations the limitations which would be attached to it in others.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>at 379 [86 S.Ct. at 515,] quoting <em>Fisher v. Cushman, </em>103 F. 860, 864 (CA 1, 1900). In determining the term\u2019s scope \u2014 and its limitations \u2014 the purposes of the Bankruptcy Act \u201cmust ultimately govern.\u201d 382 U.S. at 379 [86 S.Ct. at 515], <em>See also Lines v. Frederick, </em>440 U.S. 18 [, 91 S.Ct. 113, 27 L.Ed.2d 124] (1970); <em>Local Loan Co. v. Hunt, </em>292 U.S. 234 [, 54 S.Ct. 695, 78 L.Ed. 1230] (1934).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b463-10\">417 U.S. at 645, 94 S.Ct. at 2433.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-11\">Noting the twofold purpose of the Bankruptcy Act of paying off the bankrupt\u2019s creditors and giving the bankrupt a fresh start, 417 U.S. at 645-646, 94 S.Ct. 2431, the Court suggested that the \u201cproperty\u201d issue is to be resolved by determining whether the asset in question is \u201c \u2018sufficiently rooted in the prebankruptcy past\u2019 \u201d that depriving the bankrupt of it to pay his creditors \u201c \u2018will not hinder his ability to make a <em>fresh start </em>unhampered by the pressure of preexisting debt,\u2019 \u201d 417 U.S. at 648, 94 S.Ct. at 2435.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-12\">The claims asserted by Brummett in this action are for alleged injury to a contractual relationship which presumably was, in addition to other things, generating income for the payment of then existing debts and which was terminated over IV2 years before he was adjudged bankrupt. To deprive him of this asset would not appear to unduly hinder his ability to make a fresh start.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-13\">Thus, applying the <em>Kokoszka </em>test to the instant case, we conclude that the court below was correct in holding that Brummett\u2019s cause of action vested in the trustee of his bankrupt estate under \u00a7 70a(6) because it arose upon an injury to his property.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> <em>See In re Farrell Publishing Corp., </em>165 F.Supp. 40 (S.D.N.Y.1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b464-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number> In some eases, a bankruptcy trustee chooses to formally abandon a claim. In such cases, the cause of action revests in the bankrupt, and he can then bring suit. In this case, however, Brummett never brought these claims to the trustee\u2019s attention. Thus, it cannot be said that they revested in him because the trustee abandoned them. <em>See Scharmer v. Carrollton Mfg. Co., </em>525 F.2d 95, 98 (6th Cir. 1975); <em>Dallas Cabana Inc. v. Hyatt Corporation, </em>441 F.2d 865, 867 (5th Cir. 1971); <em>Slonim, supra. </em>Thus Brummett cannot now, after having been discharged in bankruptcy, assert this cause of action. <em>First National Bank v. Lasater, </em>196 U.S. 115, 25 S.Ct. 206, 49 L.Ed. 408 (1905); <em>Scharmer, supra, </em>at 98-99; <em>Dallas Cabana, Inc., supra at </em>867-868; <em>Wallace v. Lawrence Warehouse Company, </em>338 F.2d 392, 395 (9th Cir. 1964). <em>Gochenour v. George &amp; Francis Ball Foundation, </em>35 F.Supp. 508 (D.C.Ind.1940), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>117 F.2d 259 (7th Cir. 1941); <em>Constant v. Kulukundis, </em>125 F.Supp. 305 (S.D.N.Y. 1954). <em>See also, Danciger and Emerich Oil Company v. Smith, </em>276 U.S. 542, 545-547, 48 S.Ct. 344, 72 L.Ed. 691 (1928).</p>\n<p id=\"b464-4\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">Brummett argued to the court below that upon holding that title to the claims asserted by him in this action had passed to the trustee, the proper course for the court would be to join the trustee as a party plaintiff. Noting that the bankruptcy case had been closed, the court rejected this suggestion, stating that \u201c[fjurther action with reference to assets in the estate can only proceed in accordance with Bankruptcy Rule 515.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> On this appeal Brum-mett contends that the district court\u2019s dismissal of his claims without prejudice was an abuse of discretion. He claims that the court should have either a) ordered notice to and joinder of the trustee in bankruptcy, or b) allowed him to proceed for the benefit of his creditors. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-9\">It is true that the parties were already before the court, that the issues in the case had already been framed, and that to require the parties to go back and file an entirely new lawsuit is not the most economical use of judicial resources imaginable. <em>See Gerr v. Schering Corp., </em>256 F.Supp. 572, 574 (S.D.N.Y.1966); <em>James v. Iridyn Industries, Inc., </em>Civil Action No. C\u201478\u2014924-A (N.D.Ga., September 15, 1978). Were we considering this suggestion <em>de novo </em>as a trial court, we might well agree that the most reasonable solution to the problem presented by this case would be to stay the proceedings so that the bankruptcy proceedings could be reopened and the trustee made a party plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-10\">But as the district court noted, the closing of the bankruptcy case means that the trustee had already distributed the bankrupt\u2019s assets to his creditors and filed an account with and been discharged by the court. At the time of this case, there was no trustee to notify or join in the present action. Re-opening the case pursuant to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>Rule 515 would have involved at least some delay in the prosecution of this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">In light of these facts, we cannot say that it constituted an abuse of discretion for the district court to rule as it did. This is particularly so since the predicament in which Brummett now finds himself is the result of his never having listed this right of action as an asset of his bankruptcy estate or otherwise brought it to the trustee\u2019s attention.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">Nor did the district court abuse its discretion in refusing to permit Brummett to proceed for the benefit of his creditors. As the creditors themselves would have had to obtain leave from the bankruptcy court before proceeding on their own behalf, <em>see Gochenour, supra </em>at 517, Brummett stands in no better position. <em>See Dallas Cabana, Inc., supra </em>at 868. Since Brummett failed to obtain such prior authorization from the bankruptcy court, the district court was without authority to permit Brummett to proceed in this action for the benefit of his creditors.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-7\">II. Dismissal of State Law Claims</p>\n<p id=\"b465-8\">Plaintiff Lewis Coal Company contends that the district court abused its discretion in dismissing its pendent state claims. In response, the Union argues that Lewis Coal Company, having moved for and been granted a voluntary non-suit of its Section 303 claims without prejudice, now lacks standing to appeal from the district court\u2019s prior order declining to exercise pendent jurisdiction over the asserted law claims. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-9\">The general rule is to be that a plaintiff who has requested and been granted or agreed to a voluntary dismissal of his action without prejudice cannot maintain or prosecute an appeal from the order of dismissal. <em>Le Compte v. Mr. Chip, Inc., </em>528 F.2d 601, 603 (5th Cir. 1976); <em>Scholl v. Felmont Oil Corp., </em>327 F.2d 697, 700 (6th Cir. 1964); <em>Kelly v. Great Atlantic &amp; Pacific Tea Company, </em>86 F.2d 296 (4th Cir. 1936); Annot. 23, A.L.R.2d \u00a7 2, p. 664; 5 Moore\u2019s Federal Practice \u00b6 41.05[3], at 41-79 (2d ed. 1978). <em>Accord, </em>9 C. Wright &amp; A. Miller, Federal Practice &amp; Procedure: Civil \u00a7 2376, at 247 (1971). As the court stated in <em>Kelly, supra:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-11\">It is well settled that, from a judgment of involuntary nonsuit, an appeal lies by the party aggrieved, as such a judgment is not only a final determination of the action but has been rendered without the consent and over the objection of the plaintiff who complains of it. But, although a voluntary nonsuit is a final termination of the action, it has been entered at the request of plaintiff, and he may not, after causing the order to be entered, complain of it on appeal. For this reason, it is well settled in the federal courts that no appeal lies from a judgment of voluntary nonsuit.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b465-13\">86 F.2d at 296\u2014297 (citations omitted). In explaining the rationale underlying the rule, the court in <em>Le Compte, supra, </em>stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ANM\">This can easily be understood since the plaintiff has acquired that which he sought, the dismissal of his action and the right to bring a later suit on the same cause of action, without adjudication of the merits. The effect of this type of dismissal is to put the plaintiff in a legal position as if he had never brought the first suit. <em>Maryland Casualty Co. v. Latham, </em>41 F.2d 312, 313 (5th Cir. 1930); <em>Humphreys v. United States, </em>272 F.2d 411, 412 (9th Cir. 1959).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b465-14\">528 F.2d at 603.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-15\">After the district court dismissed Lewis Coal Company\u2019s pendent state claims, the Company requested and was granted a voluntary dismissal of its Section 303 claim. The above-cited authority makes clear that it cannot now appeal the order of dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-16\">Plaintiff tries to side-step the above conclusion by arguing that the appeal here is only from that portion of the July 25 order dismissing its pendent state claims \u2014 and not from that portion of the order wherein the trial court approved a voluntary dismissal of the federal claims under Rule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>41(a)(2), F.R.Civ.Pro. While true, this technicality is of no benefit to plaintiff. As the court in <em>Kelly, supra, </em>explained in an analogous situation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-4\">It does not help plaintiff to say that his complaint is of the order refusing remand of the cause and not of the judgment of nonsuit, which is relied upon merely as a final order from which appeal may be taken. Even in those rare jurisdictions which permit appeal from an order of voluntary nonsuit where there is a ruling of the court which strikes at the heart of the case and precludes recovery by plaintiff, appeal from such order does not lie to review rulings which do not have the effect of determining the case against plaintiff. . . The order refusing to remand the case did not, of course, determine it; and it cannot be said that, when plaintiff refused to proceed, there was nothing for the court to do but to dismiss the case and that it was therefore virtually ended. If plaintiff, after refusing to proceed, had not taken a voluntary nonsuit, defendant could have insisted on a verdict and judgment of the merits, which would have been determinative of the rights of the parties and would not have left plaintiff at liberty to commence another action for the same cause, as is his right under the voluntary nonsuit. The crux of the matter is that an order refusing to remand is not a final or appealable order, and plaintiff cannot make it in effect appealable by the simple expedient of taking a voluntary nonsuit and appealing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b466-14\">86 F.2d at 297 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b466-15\">In some cases involving multi-count complaints, a court will permit a plaintiff who has voluntarily dismissed certain of the counts to appeal from an involuntary dismissal of the remaining counts. This was the case in <em>Division 241 Amalgamated Transit Union (AFL-CIO) v. Suscy, </em>538 F.2d 1264 (7th Cir. 1976), where the court ruled that the judgment of the district court granting plaintiff\u2019s motion to dismiss Count I of a four-count complaint was a final and appealable order where the plaintiff had requested and been granted a voluntary dismissal without prejudice of the remaining three counts.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b466-16\">But while often dubbed a Rule 41(a) voluntary dismissal, the procedure followed in <em>Suscy, supra, </em>is more properly viewed as a Rule 15 amendment to the complaint. <em>See </em>5 Moore\u2019s Federal Practice \u00b6 41.06-1, at 41-92-93;<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> <em>Smith, Kline &amp; French Laborato</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number><em>ries v.

Spotnails, Inc., </em>291 F.Supp. 974, 976 (N.D.Ill.1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b467-4\">Viewed in this light, it becomes clear that while this procedural difference may be of no consequence when claims of equal footing are involved, it makes a great deal of difference in a case such as the present. For to say that plaintiff\u2019s dismissal of the federal claims constituted an amendment of the complaint is also to say that there remains no federal claims to which the state claims may be appended.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">We note that while the dismissal of the state claims precluded their adjudication on the merits in this lawsuit, it did not preclude their adjudication in a state court. And as the court\u2019s decision to dismiss the pendent claims was without prejudice, this judgment has no <em>res judicata </em>effect even in a subsequent suit filed in federal court.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">Having determined that the Company\u2019s voluntary dismissal of its Section 303 claims precludes it from complaining of the district court\u2019s dismissal of the pendent state claims, we need not address whether the court\u2019s dismissal of those claims constituted an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-7\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court holding that title to Brummett\u2019s claims vested exclusively in the trustee of his bankrupt estate and dismissing Lewis Coal Company\u2019s pendent state claims is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b458-8\">.

At the time, Lewis Coal Company actually consisted of two entities: the S &amp; R Partnership, a general partnership organized under the laws of Tennessee, and the Stewart-Reid Coal Company. The entities operated pursuant to an arrangement whereby the S &amp; R Partnership leased the mineral rights to certain properties in Scott and Morgan Counties while the Stewart-Reid Coal Company mined and sold the coal recovered pursuant to the mineral leases. The Lewis Coal Company apparently got its name from these two entities\u2019 predecessor in interest, the C. R.

In January, 1975, Brummett, who had incorporated his coal hauling business under the name of Southern Belle Trucking Company, Inc., entered into an exclusive contract with Lewis Coal Company whereby all coal mined by Lewis Coal Company would be hauled by Brummett.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-18\">In its statement of facts, the Union notes that while Brummett commenced this action as an individual doing business as Southern Belle Trucking Company and while the complaint states that Brummett entered into a hauling contract with Lewis Coal Company, in fact, the written hauling agreement indicates that it was between Lewis Coal Company, on the one hand, and Brummett and Southern Belle Trucking Company, Inc., a corporation, on the other. The Union also notes that plaintiffs\u2019 proposed findings of fact stated that the contract was with Southern Belle, which is in accord with Brummett\u2019s deposition testimony that he signed the contract only as a guarantor.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-19\">While the Union raised these points in its statement of the case, it makes no use of them in its argument. \u25a0 As the court is unaware of their particular significance to the issues before us, we will restrict our consideration of them to this notation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b459-9\">. In November, 1975, Lewis Coal Company, Inc. was dissolved pursuant to Section 333 of the Internal Revenue Code and its assets and liabilities were transferred to the S &amp; R Partnership.

The district court also denied plaintiffs the opportunity afforded under Rule 56(f), F.R.Civ. Pro., to present evidence essential to justify their opposition to the motion. In rejecting plaintiffs\u2019 request to delay consideration of the motion until the day of trial in order that they might respond, the court stated that plaintiffs had already briefed the issue raised in the motion in their pretrial brief and raised it in their proposed Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law and that \u201cfurther time would not clarify the issue.\u201d See n. 8, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b462-8\">However, the fact that the issue had been addressed elsewhere cannot serve as the basis for denying plaintiff an opportunity to address the issue as specifically raised in the motion. Considerations of justice and fair play required that plaintiff be granted an opportunity to respond to the motion prior to the court\u2019s decision, particularly since all plaintiff requested was an opportunity to respond to the motion at the trial which, by then, was only three working days away.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b462-14\">. In their brief, Plaintiffs suggest that the Union\u2019s failure to raise the bankruptcy issue as an affirmative defense in its answer, See Rule 8(c), F.R.Civ.Pro., precluded it from later raising bankruptcy as a bar to recovery. However, Plaintiffs concede, as they must, that bankruptcy was alleged as a bar to recovery in the jointly drafted Pretrial Order dated April 17, 1978, and that the Union asserted that Brum-mett\u2019s claims passed to and vested in the bankruptcy trustee upon his filing a bankruptcy petition at a pre-trial hearing on April 19, 1978.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-15\">Since the issue was raised at the pretrial and included in the jointly drafted pretrial order, any suggestion of preclusion here is clearly meritless. See Rule 16, F.R.Civ.Pro. (providing that the pretrial \u201ccontrols the subsequent course of the action\u201d); <em>Case v.

We note that while section 70a provides for the divestment of causes of action arising upon injury <em>to </em>property, the section 303 provides a cause of action in cases of injury <em>in </em>business or property. The Supreme Court has pointed out that there is a very fine line to be drawn.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-8\">. there is a sufficiently clear distinction between injuries to property and \u201cinjured in his business or property,\u201d the latter being the language of the act of Congress. <em>A man is injured in his property when his property is diminished. He would not be said to have suffered an injury to his property unless the harm fell upon some object more definite and less ideal than his total wealth. A </em>trademark, or a trade-name, or a title, is property, and is regarded as an object capable of injury in various ways. But when a man is made poorer by an extravagant bill we do not regard his wealth as a unity, or the tort, if there is one, as directed against that unity as an object. We do not go behind the person of the sufferer.

Under Rule 15(a) plaintiff may amend his complaint once as a matter of course at any time before the answer is served. Otherwise he may amend his complaint only by leave of court or by written consent of the defendant. Where he seeks leave of court he invokes the district court\u2019s discretion and while leave is to be freely given when justice so requires, the court may deny leave, or impose conditions upon leave to amend to eliminate an issue or claims as it would upon a voluntary dismissal under Rule 41(a)(2).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-18\">But since the district court\u2019s discretion is involved when leave of court is required, whether plaintiffs motion is made under Rule 15 or under Rule 41(a)(2), the choice of rules is largely a technical one.
