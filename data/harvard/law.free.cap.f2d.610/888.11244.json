Barnes, appeals the denial without a hearing of his petition to vacate his sentence under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (1976). The question presented is whether \u201cthe files and records of the case conclusively show that the prisoner is entitled to no relief\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> on the claim that his statements to the police were involuntary and should not have been admitted at his trial. We reverse and remand for a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-12\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-13\">Our review of the trial transcript and record in this case reveals the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b961-14\">Shortly after noon on Saturday, March 8, 1969, appellant returned home from work. Aside from a trip to the supermarket, he and his wife spent the afternoon at home, resting and drinking whiskey. In the late afternoon, they went shopping with Mrs. Barnes\u2019 niece, Dorothy Lee Blizzard, and a male friend, Harley Davis, stopping at least twice to buy liquor. The group returned to Mrs. Blizzard\u2019s apartment on 8th Street, N.W., to consume the food and liquor they had purchased. While Mrs. Barnes cooked, Davis and the appellant went briefly to the Barnes apartment to drink some beer. On their return, Barnes and his wife began to argue, and after Barnes slapped his wife, Davis forced him from the apartment. Later in the evening, appellant came back to the Blizzard apartment, apologized to Davis for the earlier dispute, spoke briefly with his wife, and left.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-17\">Barnes returned to the Blizzard apartment yet again after midnight, and, according to three witnesses, carried a plastic Clorox bottle under his jacket. He sat with Mrs. Barnes on a couch in the kitchen, where eight-year-old Wilhelmina Blizzard was also lying. After another argument began between the couple, Mrs. Barnes grabbed the Clorox bottle and smelled the contents. She said it contained gasoline, and threatened to call the police. According to Mrs. Barnes\u2019 statement on the day she died, appellant then poured the gasoline around her and threw a lighted match on the floor. Mrs. Barnes, who weighed over 250 pounds, stated that her husband held her in the fire; Barnes claimed that he tried to pull her out, but that she slipped and fell. Mrs. Barnes was finally dragged from the fire by Harley Davis, but not until she had received severe burns over 80 percent of her body. She died the following day. Barnes himself received second and third-degree burns on his hands and face, suffered smoke inhalation, and had difficulty seeing for a day after the fire.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-18\">At issue in this case are three statements that appellant made to the police after he emerged from the burning apartment. As Sergeant Layfield, the first policeman on the scene, approached the building, Mrs. Blizzard shouted to him that Barnes had set the fire. When Layfield asked Barnes if that were true, appellant replied, \u201cWell, I will take the blame for it.\u201d The sergeant then said, \u201cI am not asking you to take the blame. I am asking you if you set the fire.\u201d Barnes responded, \u201cYes, I did, but it was an accident.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Barnes\u2019 second statement was made after he had been placed under arrest and had been turned over to Officer Tropf. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"890\">*890</page-number>As Tropf led Barnes from the apartment to the police car, Barnes said, \u201cI am sorry I did it. What do you think they will do to me?\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The final statement at issue occurred shortly after Barnes arrived at the police station. After his rights had been read to him twice, appellant told Officer Fuksa that his wife had picked up the Clorox bottle to throw at him, that he had attempted to kiss her, and that the bottle fell to the floor and accidentally ignited.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b962-4\">In August, 1970, appellant was found competent to stand trial after a sixty-day examination at St. Elizabeth\u2019s Hospital. The psychiatrist\u2019s report noted that Barnes had an I.Q. of 67, \u201cwhich is in the defective range,\u201d and that tests showed \u201csigns of organic brain syndrome illustrated [by] visual motor deficit resembling senility.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Although the hospital staff also said that appellant lacked \u201cabstraction capabilities\u201d and the ability to \u201cintegrate ideation,\u201d <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the report concluded that there was no \u201ccausal connection\u201d between appellant\u2019s retardation and the alleged offense.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b962-5\">At a hearing on January 18, 1971, 22 months after the fire, the district court denied appellant\u2019s motion to suppress his statements on the grounds that they had been obtained in violation of <em>Miranda v. </em>Arizona.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> At no time during the pretrial hearing or the ensuing trial, however, did defense counsel challenge the statements as involuntarily made. After two days of testimony, the court, <em>at the request of the prosecution and over defense objection, </em>submitted to the jury the question of the voluntariness of Barnes\u2019 statements.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Barnes was found guilty of felony murder, first and second degree murder, and arson, and was sentenced to life imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-12\">Barnes appealed his conviction <em>in forma pauperis. </em>Court-appointed counsel on appeal, who was not trial counsel, pressed the <em>Miranda </em>claim again; challenged Officer Tropf\u2019s testimony on the grounds that the policeman lost the notes he had taken at the time of arrest; charged that Mrs. Barnes\u2019 statements did not fall under the dying declaration exception to the hearsay rule; and claimed that the jury instruction on voluntariness was unfairly prejudicial because it unduly emphasized appellant\u2019s statements. This court rejected all of Barnes\u2019 claims and affirmed the conviction.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b962-13\">Appellant, acting <em>pro se, </em>filed a \u00a7 2255 petition in April, 1973, on the same grounds raised in his appeal, adding only a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. The district court denied that motion without a hearing, and this court denied leave to appeal <em>in forma pauperis.</em><footnotemark><em>11</em></footnotemark><em> </em>On November 3, 1976, Barnes filed the instant petition, this time with assistance from the Public Defender Service, directly disputing the volun-tariness of his statements. The petition relied on several factors indicating that the statements were not voluntary: at the time they were made, Barnes was suffering from second and third-degree burns on his hands and face and had received no medical atten<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"891\">*891</page-number>tion;<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> he had been drinking for twelve hours before the fire and consequently was intoxicated;<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> he was mentally retarded and educationally disadvantaged;<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> he had little previous experience with the law<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> and was not given his <em>Miranda </em>warnings until after he made the first two statements; and he was in shock from the fire and from seeing his wife seriously injured.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b963-5\">The district court rejected this petition without a hearing on the ground that Barnes presented \u201cnothing new,\u201d stating: \u201c[A]ll of the facts in support of his motion were before this Court during the initial proceedings and on petitioner\u2019s last <em>pro se </em>motion, as well as before the jury and the Court of Appeals.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Upon appeal from the district court\u2019s denial of leave to proceed on appeal <em>in forma pauperis, </em>this court granted such leave. Appellant now argues that the district court erred in not according him a hearing. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-7\">At no time has any court considered appellant\u2019s claim of involuntariness. The pretrial hearing on defendant\u2019s motion to suppress focused exclusively on whether the <em>Miranda </em>warnings were required or given, with no reference whatsoever to the question of voluntariness.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> No mention was made of any of the factors cited in the instant petition indicating that Barnes\u2019 statements may not have been \u201cthe product of a rational intellect and a free will.\u201d <em>Blackburn v. Alabama, </em>361 U.S. 199, 208, 80 S.Ct. 274, 280, 4 L.Ed.2d 242 (1960). Similarly, the admission of Barnes\u2019 statements into evidence at trial, without more, cannot be construed as an implicit finding of volun-tariness: \u201cAlthough the judge need not make formal findings of fact or write an opinion, his conclusion that the confession is voluntary must appear from the record with unmistakable clarity.\u201d <em>Sims v. Georgia, </em>385 U.S. 538, 544, 87 S.Ct. 639, 643, 17 L.Ed.2d 593 (1967). Nor can the instruction to the jury on voluntariness support the district court\u2019s ruling on this petition. Under <em>Jackson v. Denno, </em>the jury\u2019s verdict cannot be interpreted as a finding on the constitutional question of voluntariness, since such determinations can only be made by the trial judge.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b964-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"892\">*892</page-number>The opinion by this court on direct appeal only discussed voluntariness as it related to appellant\u2019s contention that the jury instruction prejudicially directed attention to the statements.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The Government notes that this court, in rejecting Barnes\u2019 <em>Miranda </em>claim, characterized his remark to Officer Tropf as \u201can entirely voluntary statement.\u201d <footnotemark>21</footnotemark> That observation, however, was followed by the phrase, \u201csince this police officer asked him no questions.\u201d The issue thus addressed was whether Barnes volunteered the remark, not whether the statement was voluntary in a constitutional sense. The opinion never discussed the claim that defendant\u2019s due process rights were violated by the admission of his allegedly involuntary statements.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> The \u201cfiles and records\u201d of the case therefore do not reveal any prior adjudication of appellant\u2019s voluntariness claim, and the district court\u2019s denial of petitioner\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion on that ground was erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-5\">The government contends that even if the district court ruling was in error, Barnes is precluded from raising the volun-tariness question in this petition because he \u201cdeliberately bypassed the orderly federal procedures provided at or before trial and by way of appeal . . . .\u201d Brief for Appellee at 9, <em>quoting Kaufman v. United States, </em>394 U.S. 217, 227 n. 8, 89 S.Ct. 1068, 1075 n. 8, 22 L.Ed.2d 227 (1969). Because the present record is subject to differing interpretations, however, we cannot determine whether counsel\u2019s failure to raise the voluntariness claim was an informed and deliberate strategic waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-14\">Standing alone, counsel\u2019s trial conduct might suggest that his failure to object was intentional. Counsel not only remained silent when Barnes\u2019 statements were introduced; he even tried to capitalize on them by arguing that they demonstrated that the remorseful Barnes had claimed from the outset that the fire was an accident.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Moreover, when the prosecutor specifically raised the voluntariness issue by requesting an instruction on that question, counsel tried to prevent the charge from being given, thus rejecting yet another opportunity to have the statements excluded from the jury\u2019s consideration.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b965-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"893\">*893</page-number>On the other hand, counsel\u2019s pretrial efforts to have these same statements suppressed on <em>Miranda </em>grounds belies any suggestion that his repeated waiver of the vol-untariness issue was an intentional trial tactic; rather, through lack of adequate legal or factual preparation, counsel may simply have been unaware that the alleged involuntariness of the statements would constitute an independent basis for their suppression.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Under this hypothesis, counsel\u2019s efforts at trial to turn Barnes\u2019 remarks to his advantage can be seen as only an attempt to make the best of a bad situation, the. trial judge previously having held the statement admissible.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b965-5\">These conflicting interpretations of the record can be resolved only by an evi-dentiary hearing in the district court. Should the court conclude that counsel\u2019s failure to raise the voluntariness issue amounted to a \u201cdeliberate bypass,\u201d it may deny relief on the ground that appellant has waived his right to collateral review.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> If, however, the district court is unable to find that a deliberate bypass has occurred, it must then determine whether that standard, or the \u201cnarrower\u201d \u201ccause and prejudice\u201d test,<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> is the appropriate waiver rule in the circumstances of this case. Because Barnes\u2019 trial predated the 1975 amendments to the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure,<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> the express waiver provisions contained in the present Rule 12(f) are inapplicable.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Although we have held in similar circumstances that a procedural default <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"894\">*894</page-number>forecloses collateral review under \u00a7 2255 only where it amounts to a \u201cdeliberate bypassing attributable to the defendant,\u201d<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> the district court should nevertheless consider whether the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Wainwright v. Sykes, supra, </em>requires us to abandon that standard in favor of the \u201ccause and prejudice\u201d test. <em>Compare Pacelli </em>v. <em>United States, </em>588 F.2d 360 (2d Cir. 1978) (applying \u201cdeliberate bypass\u201d standard to constitutional claim not controlled by statutory waiver provision), <em>cert. denied, </em>441 U.S. 908, 99 S.Ct. 2001, 60 L.Ed.2d 378 (1979) <em>and Coco v. United States, </em>569 F.2d 367 (5th Cir. 1978) (denying \u00a7 2255 motion on \u201cdeliberate bypass\u201d theory) <em>with Sincox </em>v. <em>United States, </em>571 F.2d 876 (5th Cir. 1978) (employing \u201ccause and prejudice\u201d test to evaluate effect of procedural default on \u00a7 2255 review) <em>and Ramsey v. United States, </em>448 F.Supp. 1264 (N.D.Ill.1978) (concluding that \u201ccause and prejudice\u201d standard replaces \u201cdeliberate bypass\u201d test in \u00a7 2255 cases).<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b966-11\">On remand, therefore, the district court may pursue either of two procedures. The court may first determine whether Barnes\u2019 statements were voluntary and hence admissible at trial. If so, appellant is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"895\">*895</page-number>entitled to no relief. Alternatively, the court may first determine whether the failure to raise the voluntariness issue either at trial or on appeal should preclude consideration of that claim in this \u00a7 2255 petition. If so, the court may deny relief without inquiring into the merits of appellant\u2019s contentions.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b967-5\">\n<em>Remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b961-15\">. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (1976).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b961-19\">.

The following discussion ensued between counsel and the court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b964-18\">[PROSECUTOR]: I would propose . a simple instruction that there is evidence of a statement in the form of an admission or confession to a police officer, and before you may consider it as evidence in the case you must find beyond a reasonable doubt that it was voluntarily given by the defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b964-19\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: That would be a defense request, Your Honor.

It is difficult to perceive the exact basis of defense counsel\u2019s objection. He may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"893\">*893</page-number>have wanted to avoid any mention of Barnes\u2019 statements in the hope that the jury would forget about them. But this interpretation seems implausible in light of counsel\u2019s remarks during closing argument urging the jury to consider all three statements carefully as supporting the accident theory. Alternatively, counsel\u2019s objection may have been to the proposed instruction\u2019s characterization of the statements as \u201can admission or confession,\u201d language that would suggest that Barnes had acknowledged his guilt.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b965-7\">. The record contains several indications that appellant\u2019s court-appointed trial counsel, who was actually the fifth different attorney assigned to Barnes since his arrest and who was appointed less than a month before trial began, was not completely prepared. At the opening of the trial, for example, counsel stated that he had not seen the juror list for the case and that he had been unable to acquire his client\u2019s hospital records. Tr. at 4, 8. On the question of a possible insanity defense, <em>see </em>note 7 <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b965-8\">Moreover, as defense counsel called Barnes to the witness stand, the prosecutor pointed out that Barnes should be advised that he had the right not to testify. When the trial judge remarked that \u201c[cjertainly counsel must have explained it to him before this,\u201d counsel responded, \u201cAs a matter of fact I didn\u2019t. It never occurred to me. . . \u201d Tr. at 420. <em>Cf. </em>American Bar Association Standards Relating to the Administration of Criminal Justice: Prosecution and Defense Function \u00a7 4-5.2 (2d ed., approved draft without commentary 1979) (\u201cThe decisions which are to be made by the accused after full consultation with counsel are: (i) what pleas to enter; (ii) whether to waive jury trial; and (iii) <em>whether to testify in his or her own behalf.\u201d) </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b965-11\">. The government suggests that counsel\u2019s failure to object to the introduction of Barnes\u2019 statements was simply a concession that they were indeed voluntary. The combination of factors cited in the instant petition, however, certainly suffice to make out a colorable claim of involuntariness. <em>See </em>notes 12-16 <em>supra. </em>Absent any indication in the record that counsel actually considered and reasonably rejected the voluntariness claim, we decline to accept the government\u2019s interpretation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b965-12\">. <em>See United States v.

In discussing whether the defendant should be bound by the procedural default of his attorney, one court has suggested that a distinction should be drawn between retained and court-appointed counsel:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b966-5\">For clearly, an indigent person with court-appointed counsel cannot be said to have chosen his counsel and his defense in the same way that a person of sufficient means to hire and fire can be presumed to bear the consequences of his choice of counsel. The individualistic assumptions that underlie compelling a defendant to bear the consequences of his attorney\u2019s actions . . . may not be</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b966-6\">valid in a case with court-appointed counsel. <em>United States v. Underwood, </em>440 F.Supp. 499, 503 (D.R.I.) (citations omitted), <em>aff\u2019d without opinion, </em>553 F.2d 91 (1st Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>430 U.S. 950, 97 S.Ct. 1590, 51 L.Ed.2d 799 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b966-7\">Although this argument has surface appeal, it presupposes the effectiveness of retained counsel, an assumption that may not be warranted for attorneys hired by defendants of limited resources. <em>See generally </em>L. Downie, Justice Denied 174-77 (1971); Alschuler, <em>The Defense Attorney\u2019s Role in Plea Bargaining, </em>84 Yale L.J. 1179, 1181-1206 (1975). In addition, this distinction is valid only if one can reasonably conclude that retained counsel, wherever possible, will consult with their clients and explain the basis for their actions. <em>Cf. Haziel v. United States, </em>131 U.S.App.D.C. 298, 301, 404 F.2d 1275, 1278 (1968):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b966-8\">In other circumstances we rely upon counsel to speak for his client not because we believe the attorney must make the decision, but because we assume the attorney has consulted with his client, advised him of what is at stake, and helped him toward a wise decision.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"32\">\n<p id=\"b966-9\">. The government argued only that Barnes\u2019 actions constituted a \u201cdeliberate bypass,\u201d and neither party has addressed the supervening issue of whether a procedural default short of a deliberate bypass can foreclose collateral review under \u00a7 2255. In these circumstances, and in light of the possibility that it may not be necessary for the district court to reach this question, we do not presently intimate any views on the appropriate waiver standard in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-13\">The evidentiary hearing on the waiver issue will naturally focus on why counsel failed to object to the introduction of Barnes\u2019 statements on voluntariness grounds. Although the precise inquiry will depend on what standard the court deems applicable, the relevant questions might include: (1) whether the omission was, or is susceptible of being interpreted as, an intentional trial tactic, <em>see e. g., Henry v. Mississippi, </em>379 U.S. 443, 451, 85 S.Ct. 564, 13 L.Ed.2d 408 (1965); <em>Satterfield v. Zahradnick, </em>572 F.2d 443, 446 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>436 U.S. 920, 98 S.Ct. 2270, 56 L.Ed.2d 762 (1978); (2) whether it was an advertent (conscious and knowing) decision by counsel, <em>see, e. g., Cole v. Stevenson, </em>447 F.Supp. 1268, 1273-74 (E.D.N. C.1978); <em>cf. United States v. Hall, </em>565 F.2d 917, 920 (5th Cir. 1978); (3) whether it was negligent or unreasonable, <em>see, e. g., Jiminez v. Estelle, </em>557 F.2d 506, 511 (5th Cir. 1977) (dicta); <em>Collins v. Auger, </em>577 F.2d 1107, 1110 n. 2 (8th Cir. 1978), cert. <em>denied, </em>439 U.S. 1133, 99 S.Ct. 1057, 59 L.Ed.2d 96 (1979); (4) whether it amounted to ineffective assistance, <em>see, e. g., Boyer </em>v. <em>Patton, </em>579 F.2d 284, 288 (3d Cir. 1978); <em>Sincox v. United States, </em>571 F.2d 876, 879-80 (5th Cir. 1978); <em>Rinehart v. Brewer, </em>561 F.2d 126 (8th Cir. 1977); and (5) whether appellant was apprised of counsel\u2019s intention to acquiesce in the admission of his statements at trial, <em>see, e. g., Wainwright v. Sykes, supra, </em>433 U.S. at 92-94, 97 S.Ct. 2497 (Burger, C.

The court held that where a \u00a7 2255 petition alleges that the sentencing court has improperly relied upon an invalid prior conviction, the \u00a7 2255 judge may first determine the merits of the petitioner\u2019s contention, thus avoiding what may be an unnecessary eviden-tiary hearing on the waiver issue. <em>Id. </em>at 1356-57.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b967-6\">ROBB, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AdV\">dissenting:</p>\n<p id=\"b967-7\">In 1971 the appellant Barnes was tried to a jury and convicted of murder and arson. The proof for the government, including the testimony of eyewitnesses, was that Barnes killed his wife by pouring gasoline on the floor of her room, lighting it with a match, and holding her in the flames. Immediately after the event he made three oral statements to the police, the substance of which was that he had caused the fire but it was an accident and he was sorry. At the trial he was vigorously defended by an experienced criminal lawyer. His defense, consistent with his statements to the police, was that the spilling of the gasoline and the fire were accidental.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-8\">Barnes appealed his conviction. In this court he was represented by another experienced and able criminal lawyer. The conviction was affirmed. <em>United States v. Barnes, </em>150 U.S.App.D.C. 319, 464 F.2d 828 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b967-9\">The majority now proposes to retry the case, upon the newly minted theory that Barnes\u2019 statements to the police might have been involuntary, that his due process rights might have been violated by their admission in evidence, and that trial counsel\u2019s \u201crepeated waiver of the voluntariness issue\u201d might have been the result of \u201clack of adequate legal or factual preparation.\u201d Being unable to accept this theory, which I consider unrealistic, I would affirm the denial of the petition to vacate sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-11\">The three Barnes statements to the police and the circumstances under which they were made are recounted in the record as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b967-12\">1. The first statement was made to police sergeant Layfield who responded to a \u201cradio run\u201d to investigate trouble at 1014-8th Street, N.W., the scene of the fire. Sgt. Layfield testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b967-13\">Upon my arrival I observed several Fire Department vehicles in the ten hundred block of the figure eight street, Northwest.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b967-14\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b967-15\">As I was walking down towards that address I was approached by a male and a female subject.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b967-16\">The female subject, who was later identified as Dorothy Blizzard, said \u201cThat\u2019s the man. That\u2019s the man who started the fire.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b967-17\">At this time I looked at the male subject, who was later identified as the defendant, and stated, \u201cIs that true? Did you start the fire?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b967-18\">He says, \u201cI will take the blame for it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b967-19\">I said, \u201cSir, I am not asking you to take the blame. I asked you if you started the fire.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b967-20\">He said, \u201cYes, I did. It was an accident.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b967-21\">At this time I placed him under arrest.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b967-22\">Q. Now at the time that Mrs. Blizzard talked to you had you been into the premises at 1014 Eighth Street, Northwest?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b967-23\">A. No, sir, I had not been.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b967-24\">Q. Did you know what had happened at 1014 Eighth Street, Northwest?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b967-25\">A. No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b967-26\">I had not.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"atu-dedup-1\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"896\">*896</page-number>(Tr. 10, 11)</p>\n<p id=\"b968-4\">2. Sgt. Layfield turned Barnes over to Officer Tropf. Officer Tropf testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b968-5\">A. I took ahold of Mr. Barnes by the wrist and by the back and top and the rear of his trousers to take him back to the scout car.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b968-6\">Q. What happened then, if anything, Officer Tropf?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b968-7\">A. Before I could turn and leave with Mr. Barnes, a lady lying in front of 1014-8th Street, Northwest, looked up at Mr. Barnes and said to him,\u201cYou had no call to do that to me, Bennie,\u201d and then lapsed back into moaning.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b968-8\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b968-9\">Q. Now after she said that, what, if anything, happened then.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b968-10\">A. After she said that, I turned with the defendant to take him back to the scout car. And while en route back to the scout car, Mr. Barnes made a statement to me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b968-11\">Q. He made a statement to you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b968-12\">A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b968-13\">Q. Did you ask him to make a statement?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b968-14\">A. No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b968-15\">Q. Had you said anything to him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b968-16\">A. No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b968-17\">Q. What did he say?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b968-18\">A. He said, \u201cI am sorry I did it. What do you think they will do to me?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b968-19\">Q. Did he say anything else, sir?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b968-20\">A. If he did, I don\u2019t recall, sir.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AGs\">(Tr. 57, 58)</p>\n<p id=\"b968-21\">3. When the patrol wagon arrived to take Barnes to the stationhouse Officer Fuksa advised him of his <em>Miranda </em>rights. At the stationhouse the officer again advised Barnes of his rights, asked him if he understood them; and Barnes said he did. The officer testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b968-22\">A. At that time I began filling out the forms which are needed, and I asked the defendant his name and his address.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b968-23\">And at that time he stated to me that Ella had called him over to 1014-8th Street. And he said that he responded over there and that when he arrived they got in an argument. And at this time she had picked up a plastic Clorox bottle which was filled with gasoline and was going to throw it on him. And he said to me that he acted like any man, and he tried to kiss her, and at that time the bottle dropped to the floor and ignited.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b968-25\">Q. Did he say anything further?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b968-26\">A. No, he didn\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b968-27\">Q. Had you asked him anything other than his name and address?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b968-28\">A. No, sir, just his name and address.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b968-29\">Q. No other questions at all?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b968-30\">A. No, sir.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b968-31\">(J.A. 35, 36)</p>\n<p id=\"b968-32\">A friend of Mrs. Barnes, Harley Davis, dragged her out of the fire. He testified that seeing Barnes standing nearby \u201cI asked him, I said, \u2018What did you do this for Bennie?\u2019 Just like that. And he said, T am sorry. I was wrong.\u2019 That\u2019s all he said.\u201d (Tr. 265) Within moments thereafter the police arrived and Barnes was arrested. The majority says that when he talked to the police Barnes was in such condition and subject to such handicaps that his statements to the officers may have been involuntary. My colleagues do not suggest that the statement to Davis was involuntary; yet when he made it Barnes was subject to the same conditions and handicaps that existed when he talked to the police, only moments later.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-33\">In my judgment there is no basis whatever for a contention that Barnes\u2019 statements to the police were involuntary. If they were, then I do not see how any statement could be voluntary. Barnes spoke to the police of his own volition; no one coerced or pressed him to speak, nor did any of the circumstances mentioned by the majority exert any such pressure or coercion. In my opinion what the majority considers a \u201cwaiver of the involuntariness issue\u201d by counsel was merely a sensible decision to refrain from frivolous argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"897\">*897</page-number>I think the proceedings on remand which the majority orders will be a sterile academic exercise. Accordingly I dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
