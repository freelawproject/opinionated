During that litigation, Fraige discovered the contents of the '800 application. In the belief that that application claimed the invention disclosed and claimed in his patent, Fraige petitioned for institution of a public use proceeding under 37 CFR 1.292.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-25\">The Commissioner referred the petition and all related papers to the examiner in charge of the \u2019800 application. The examiner having reported that a <em>prima facie </em>showing of \u201con sale\u201d or public use had not been made, the Commissioner denied the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-26\">Fraige filed a second petition, again requesting a public use proceeding.- Treating that petition as a request for reconsideration, the Commissioner again refused to initiate the proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-27\">OPINION</p>\n<p id=\"b867-28\">Though this court has the power under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1651(a) to issue all writs necessary or appropriate in aid of its jurisdiction, <em>Goodbar </em>v. <em>Banner, </em>599 F.2d 431, 433, 202 USPQ 106, 108 (Cust. &amp; Pat.App.1979); <em>Loshbough v. Allen, </em>404 F.2d 1400, 56 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"796\">*796</page-number>CCPA 913, 160 USPQ 204 (1969), \u00a7 1651(a) does not expand a court\u2019s jurisdiction. \u201c[I]t is incumbent upon any petitioner seeking * * * [a writ of mandamus and prohibition] this court to demonstrate that we have subject matter jurisdiction over the issue involved.\u201d <em>Goodbar v. Banner, </em>599 F.2d at 434, 202 USPQ at 108. No such demonstration has been made.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-5\">The Commissioner\u2019s action here does not frustrate our prospective jurisdiction. <em>See Margolis </em>v. <em>Banner, </em>599 F.2d 435, 441, 202 USPQ 365, 371 (Cust. &amp; Pat.App.1979). \u201c[O]ur grant of jurisdiction does not, in the normal course of events, provide us with the authority to <em>directly </em>review or supervise the acts of the Commissioner.\u201d <em>Godtfredsen v. Banner, </em>598 F.2d 589, 593, 202 USPQ 7, 11 (Cust. &amp; Pat.App.1979) (emphasis in original). Because the matter complained of is not one cognizable by this court on appeal, we dismiss the petition for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-6\">The request for attorneys costs and fees is denied, <em>Meitzner v. Mindick, </em>549 F.2d 775, 784, 193 USPQ 17, 24 (Cust. &amp; Pat.App. 1976) <em>cert. denied, </em>434 U.S. 854, 98 S.Ct. 171, 54 L.Ed.2d 124, 195 USPQ 465 (1977); <em>Reddy </em>v. <em>Dann, </em>529 F.2d 1347, 1349, 188 USPQ 644, 645 (Cust. &amp; Pat.App.1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b868-7\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
