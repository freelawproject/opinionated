However, as such an organization it is subject to such tax with respect to its \u201cunrelated business income\u201d pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 511 through 515 of the Code. Contending that it is entitled to more favorable tax treatment under the Code, i. e. that its unrelated business income not be subject to federal income tax, it filed a declaratory judgment proceeding in the Tax Court. In its petition in the Tax Court appellant asserted that it qualified as \u201can organization described in Section 170(b)(1)(A)(v)\u201d of the Code and relied on \u00a7 7428 of the Code for jurisdiction. The Tax Court entered an order (Docket No. 4811-77) dismissing appellant\u2019s petition, holding that it had no jurisdiction under \u00a7 7428 of the Code and thus this appeal.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b521-9\">We conclude that the Tax Court was correct in its decision that \u00a7 7428 of the Code did not vest it with jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-10\">The legislative history clearly shows that \u00a7 7428 was enacted to obviate a particular problem. This problem arose when organizations claiming entitlement to treatment or to continued treatment under \u00a7 501(c)(3) (which appellant already has) were turned down, and a long period of time would expire before they could obtain a definitive determination. Thus Congress enacted \u00a7 7428 to give the Tax Court declaratory judgment jurisdiction to make such determination. Moreover, the very language of \u00a7 7428 provides that the Tax Court would have jurisdiction where there is a case in controversy involving a determination by the Secretary \u201cwith respect to the initial qualification or continuing qualification of an organization as an organization described in Section 501(c)(3).\u201d Here appellant is not seeking to have the Tax Court declare that it is <em>qualified </em>to receive favorable treatment as an organization described in \u00a7 501(c)(3); it is seeking to have the Tax Court declare that it is qualified to receive the even more favorable treatment under other provisions of the Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-13\">Accordingly, the order of the Tax Court dismissing the petition is</p>\n<p id=\"b521-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b521-11\"> Appellant is also raising the issue of its entitlement to be treated as an organization described in \u00a7 170(b)(1)(A)(v) in a pending proceeding to redetermine a deficiency in the Tax Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
