L. c. 167, \u00a7 34, the service of a writ at the last and usual place of abode of the defendant is not good in case the defendant is temporarily absent from the Commonwealth without the further notice required for absent defendants by R. L. c. 170.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b104-13\">A writ of error lies to vacate a judgment rendered on default after insufficient service on the defendant.</headnotes>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b104-14\">Loring, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aam\">This is a writ of error to vacate a judgment rendered on default after service at the defendant\u2019s last and usual place of abode. In the assignment of errors it is alleged that the defendant in the original action was absent from the Commonwealth at the time of service of the writ, and continued to be absent therefrom until a time after the entry of judgment, and no further notice was given, as provided in R. L. c. 170.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-15\">The contention of the defendant in error is that where the defendant is a resident and is only temporarily absent from the Commonwealth, further notice need not be given.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-16\">His argument is that the provisions of \u00a7 34 of R. L. c. 167, are to be read and construed in connection with those of \u00a7 31; and so construed, \u00a7 34 applies only to non-residents.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-17\">But if the original act, of1 which R. L. c. 167, \u00a7 34 is the present re-enactment, is looked at, it is plain that that section is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>to be read in connection with \u00a7 31, and that it does include residents of the Commonwealth temporarily absent from.it.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AaL\"><em>W. C. Cogswell, </em>for the plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"AOF\">\n<em>J. P. Prince, pro se.</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">The original act, of which R. L. c. 167, \u00a7 34 is now the reenactment, is Rev. Sts. c. 90, \u00a7 48, and originated in the report of the commissioners on the Revised Statutes. See c. 90, \u00a7 43. The original act of which R. L. c. 167, \u00a7 31 is the re-enactment originated in Prov. St. 1700-1, c. 20, \u00a7 1; 1 Prov. Laws, (State ed.) 447.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">The provision of Rev. Sts. c. 90, \u00a7 48, (now after successive re-enactments contained.in substance in R. L. c. 167, \u00a7 34,) is: \u201c In all cases, when the defendant is out of the State at the time of the service of the summons, he shall, in addition to the service thereof, as herein prescribed, be entitled to further notice of the suit, as provided in the ninety-second chapter.\u201d The occasion of this section seems to have been to make certain of the point now urged by the defendant in error.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-7\">In addition to this there are two cases where a judgment has been held bad against a resident temporarily absent from the Commonwealth. <em>Johnson </em>v. Thaxter, 12 Gray, 198. <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Paige, </em>4 Allen, 94.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-8\">\n<em>Judgment vacated.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
