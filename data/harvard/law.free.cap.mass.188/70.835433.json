Coombs against a constable of tlie city of Boston, for an alleged conversion of the property. Writ in the Municipal Court of the City of Boston dated August 5, 1902.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b94-12\">On appeal to the Superior Court the case was tried before <em>Wait, </em>J. It appeared that before June 4, 1902, Carrie J. Coombs was the owner of the articles of personal property in question which then were in a building numbered 377 on Columbus Avenue in Boston. On that day she mortgaged them to the plaintiff to secure the payment of $100. The mortgage was conditioned not only for the payment of the $100 but also that the mortgagor should not, except with the consent in writing of the grantee or his representative, attempt to sell or remove from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>377 Columbus Avenue the articles or any part of them. It also provided that the mortgagor should have possession until default, but that after such default the grantee or those claiming under him might take immediate possession of the property. Ten days after the making of the mortgage the mortgagor removed the articles from 377 Columbus Avenue without the consent in writing of the plaintiff, the mortgagee, and placed them in the custody of one Edna F. Manchester where they remained until taken out of her possession by the plaintiff on August 1, 1902, as follows: On July 1, 1902, one Freeman took out a trustee writ against the mortgagor as defendant and the plaintiff and Edna F. Manchester as trustees, which action was still pending when the present action was brought. On August 1, 1902, the plaintiff took possession of the mortgaged articles and put them in the hands of an auctioneer for sale. On the same day a special precept was issued by the Superior Court, while the action begun by trustee process was pending, directing the officer to whom it was addressed <em>\u201c </em>to attach the personal property of said defendant to the value of two hundred dollars in the hands of defendant as mortgagor aforesaid\u201d and to \u201csummon the said trustee, Samuel D. Jenness, ... to appear before our justices of our said court ... on Saturday, the ninth day of August, A. D. 1902, ... to answer such questions as may be put to him by the court, or by its order, touching the consideration of said mortgage and the amount due thereon.\u201d The officer\u2019s return on this writ was as follows: \u201c By virtue of this writ, I this day attached certain goods and chattels as the property of deft, and placed a keeper in charge of same, and thereafter on same day I delivered in hand to the trustee, Samuel D. Jenness, an attested copy of this precept for his appearance at court as within directed, and thereafter, on same day, I removed said keeper and stored said property, and I now hold said property in my possession subject to further order of court.\u201d It also appeared that on August 2 the plaintiff attempted to sell the goods at auction, and was prevented from doing so by the defendant\u2019s keeper, and that the articles in question were still in the possession of the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b95-5\">On August 5, 1902, the present action was brought for the alleged conversion of the property by the defendant in taking possession of it on August 1 and preventing its sale on August 2.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b96-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>The defendant asked the judge to rule as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b96-5\">1.

His argument in support of this contention is that after Manchester had been served with the trustee writ the furniture held by her was <em>in custodia legis, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>and the plaintiff could not rightfully get possession by taking it from her, citing in that connection <em>Rockwood </em>v. Varnum, 17 Pick. 289, Shaw, C. J. in <em>Allen </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>5 Met. 263, 265. See <em>Martin </em>v. <em>Bayley, </em>1 Allen, 381, 383.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">That argument rests on the assumption that the mortgagor\u2019s interest in the furniture was attached by serving the trustee writ on Manchester. But that assumption is incorrect. The interest of a mortgagor in mortgaged personal property cannot be attached by trusteeing a bailee of that property who holds for the mortgagor. The only way in which the mortgagor\u2019s interest in such property so situated can be attached is by attaching it as if it were unincumbered on a writ of summons and attachment under R. L. c. 167, \u00a7 74.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">Before St. 1829, c. 124, the mortgagor\u2019s interest in personal -property under mortgage could not be attached on mesne process, <em>Badlam </em>v. <em>Tucker, </em>1 Pick. 389, or taken on execution. <em>Lyon </em>v. <em>Coburn, </em>1 Cush. 278.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-7\">By St. 1829, c. 124, two methods were provided for reaching the mortgagor\u2019s interest in mortgaged personal property by way of mesne attachment. One was, where the mortgaged personal property was in the hands of the mortgagee, to serve the mortgagee with a trustee writ. This is now re-enacted in R. L. c. 189, \u00a7\u00a7 60, 61 and 62. The other method was to attach the personal property under a writ of summons and attachment as the property of the mortgagor, provided the person for whose benefit the attachment was made should first pay or tender to the mortgagee the full amount of the demand for which said property was mortgaged, following the suggestion made in <em>Badlam </em>v. <em>Tucker, </em>1 Pick. 389, 399, 400. This method was changed in the Rev. Sts. c. 90, \u00a7 78, so as to allow mortgaged personalty to be attached as if it were unincumbered before the mortgage debt was paid, the mortgagee\u2019s rights being preserved by a provision that the attachment should be dissolved if the attaching creditor failed to pay the mortgage debt upon a demand for it being subsequently made by the mortgagee. The making of a demand by the mortgagee for payment of the mortgage debt was further regulated by St. 1843, c. 72, \u00a7 3, and St. 1844, c. 148, \u00a7 1. These provisions are now found in R. L. c. 167, \u00a7\u00a7 69-73.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-8\">A third method for reaching the mortgagor\u2019s interest in mort<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>gaged personal property was created by St. 1844, c. 148, \u00a7\u00a7 2-6, to wit: In case the mortgaged personal property is in the hands of the mortgagor it may be attached as unincumbered and the mortgagee summoned. If the attaching creditor pursued this method he had a right to try the validity of the mortgage. Here also the mortgagee\u2019s interest is preserved by a provision that the attachment shall be dissolved if the mortgage debt is not paid. This is now re-enacted in R. L. c. 167, \u00a7\u00a7 74-78.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">Unless one of these three statutory methods of attaching the mortgagor\u2019s interest in mortgaged personal property is pursued, that interest cannot be reached on mesne process. No one of these was pursued in the case at bar. When the writ was first taken out the personal property was in the hands of a bailee of the mortgagor, and therefore could be attached only under a writ of summons and attachment as if unincumbered. In place of pursuing that method the plaintiff undertook to attach it by summoning the bailee in a trustee writ. It is only where the mortgaged personalty is in the hands of the mortgagee that the mortgagor\u2019s interest can be reached by summoning the person having possession thereof as a trustee in trustee process. In the case at bar nothing was effected by summoning Manchester as a trustee, and the plaintiff\u2019s right to take possession was in no way affected thereby. The defendant\u2019s first contention wholly fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">The defendant\u2019s second contention is also without foundation, namely, that the defendant was justified by the special precept used on August 1, 1902. The special precept recites that the mortgaged property is in the hands of the mortgagor, but is mortgaged to the plaintiff, and directs the defendant to appear \u201c to answer such questions as may be put to him by the court, or by its order, touching the consideration of said mortgage.\u201d Under it the defendant took possession of the property as unincumbered, and delivered a copy of the precept to the mortgagee. In other words, this special precept authorized an attachment in the third method mentioned above, now R. L. c. 167, \u00a7 74. But the validity of such an attachment depends upon the mortgaged property being in fact in the possession of the mortgagor. <em>Drysdale </em>v. <em>Wax, </em>175 Mass. 144. <em>Porter </em>v. <em>Warren, </em>119 Mass. 535. At the time this attachment was made in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>the case at bar the property was in the possession of the mortgagee, and this proceeding was void.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-3\">The facts proved showed a conversion. <em>Boynton </em>v. <em>Warren, </em>99 Mass. 172. <em>Porter </em>v. <em>Warren, </em>119 Mass. 535. <em>Duggan </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>157 Mass. 228.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-4\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
