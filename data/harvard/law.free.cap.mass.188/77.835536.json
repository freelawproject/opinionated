The following statement of the cases is taken from the opinion of the court:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b101-12\">On June 27, 1899, the board of street commissioners of the city of Boston, after locating anew the channel of a watercourse called Faneuil Yalley Brook and taking for that purpose an easement in a strip of land fifteen feet wide belonging in part to the plaintiffs and in part to the defendant, made this taking: \u201c This board do hereby take for the city of Boston, the right to maintain said new channel and other sewerage works in said lands as said board deem said right to be necessary for the sewerage works of said city.\u201d The taking was made under St. 1897, c. 426, as amended by St. 1899, c. 450. The later act went into effect on June 1,1899. The work was begun on August 8,1900, and was completed on January 22, 1901.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b101-13\">Under the direction of the presiding judge the jury made two findings, one in case the defendant could offset peculiar and special benefits, and the other in case it could not. If such benefits could be set off the jury in each case found that no compensation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>was due. If such, a benefit could not be set off, they found for the petitioners in the sums of $972.96, and $1,302.60, respectively. By the terms of the report, if the petitioners\u2019 contention as to the law was correct, judgment was to be entered for the petitioners for the above sums, respectively, with interest from May 3, 1904, the date of the jury\u2019s findings, to the date of judgment. If the defendant\u2019s contention was correct, judgment was to be entered for the defendant in both cases.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b102-5\"><em>E. F. McClennen, (H. F. Lyman </em>with him,) for the petitioners.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b102-6\"><em>S. H. Hudson, </em>for the respondent.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b102-7\">Loking, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AGS\">[After the foregoing statement of the case.] We are of opinion that the plaintiffs are entitled to judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-8\">The only contention made by the defendant is based on St. 1902, c. 526, which provides that \u201c The expense of the construction and maintenance of sewers in the city of Boston designed for the disposal of surface drainage solely shall be borne wholly by the said city.\u201d But under this taking the city had a right to use the channel for sewerage purposes. It follows that that defence, fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-9\">The case presented therefore is one where a benefit assessment could have been made, but the city officials neglected to make one.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-10\">That a benefit assessment could have been laid under St. 1899, c. 450, see <em>Hall </em>v. <em>Street Commissioners, </em>177 Mass. 434.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-11\">Where a benefit assessment might have been laid but none has been laid, there is no more reason for setting off the benefit than if it had been made. <em>Benton </em>v. <em>Brookline, </em>151 Mass. 250.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-12\">In accordance with the terms of the report the entry must be <em>Judgment for the plaintiff in the first case for $978.96, and in the second case for $1,308.60, with interest in each case from May 8,1904, to the date of judgment.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
