L. c. 106 by the administratrix of the estate of Lawrence Hyde, a longshoreman, being also his widow, against a stevedore employing him, for causing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>the death and conscious suffering of the plaintiff\u2019s intestate, with three counts described in the opinion.

If the section was placed in position in a certain way, it would not bear any weight upon it. The intestate and one of his fellow workmen placed it in position, the intestate then stepped upon it, was precipitated into the hold, and died after a few moments of conscious suffering.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-10\">The first count is under the R. L. c. 106, \u00a7 71, cl. 2, and alleges the negligence of a superintendent. There is no evidence to support this count.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-11\">The second count is under \u00a7 72 of the same chapter, and the negligence alleged under \u00a7 71, cl. 1, is a defect in the ways, works or machinery; and this is the count chiefly relied upon. This count was improperly joined with the others. <em>Brennan </em>v. <em>Standard Oil Co. </em>187 Mass. 376. But as this point was not raised at the trial we proceed to consider the case. The hatch in question belonged to the vessel, and was not under the control of the defendant. It was no part of the defendant\u2019s ways, works or machinery. <em>Trask </em>v. <em>Old Colony Railroad, </em>156 Mass. 298. <em>Regan </em>v. <em>Donovan, </em>159 Mass. 1. <em>Engel </em>v. <em>New York, Providence, &amp; Boston Railroad, </em>160 Mass. 260. <em>Hughes </em>v. <em>Malden </em>&amp; <em>Melrose Gas Light Co. </em>168 Mass. 395. <em>Moynihan </em>v. <em>King's Windsor Cement Co. </em>168 Mass. 450, 452. <em>Riley </em>v. <em>Tucker, </em>179 Mass. 190. <em>Kirk </em>v. <em>Sturdy, </em>187 Mass. 87.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-12\">The third count is at common law and alleges failure to furnish proper machinery and a safe place to work. The plaintiff can<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>not recover under this count for the defendant did not furnish the machinery, and had no control over the place where the plaintiff\u2019s intestate was at work. <em>Regan </em>v. Donovan, <em>Moynihan </em>v. <em>King's Windsor Cement Co. </em>and <em>Hughes </em>v. <em>Malden &amp; Melrose Gas Light </em>Co., <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
