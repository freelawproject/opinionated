The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiffs in the sum of $230.90; and the judge reported the case for determination by this court. If upon all the evidence the case should have been submitted to the jury, and if the verdict could be sustained, judgment was to be entered for the plaintiffs for the amount of the verdict and interest from March 25, 1904; otherwise, the verdict was to be set aside, and final judgment was to be entered for the defendant.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b437-11\"><em>O.

Participation in the profits of a firm is evidence that the person participating is a partner, and that the persons managing the business are his agents. <em>Eastman </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>53 N.

Whether the explanation testified to by the witness, that the defendant did not share in the profits as profits, but took them merely under the right of one of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>the partners who was his debtor and only as payment of his debt, was true or not was for the jury. There was testimony of contradictory statements on a previous occasion tending to discredit the testimony to that effect of at least one of the witnesses. The jury might well disbelieve the explanation. We have no occasion to discuss the question- whether if the explanation stated by the witnesses was true the defendant could have been held as a partner.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-3\">\n<em>Judgment for the plaintiffs on the verdict.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
