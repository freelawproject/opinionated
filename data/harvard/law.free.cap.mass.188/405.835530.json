The jury returned a verdict for the petitioners, assessing damages in the sum of $6,938; and the respondent alleged exceptions, raising the questions stated by the court and others which are held to have been waived because not argued.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b430-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number><em>C.

It is not contended that either by the condition of the property, or the use for which it was fitted, its rental value would substantially be diminished by the possibility that this might occur, and the present case is clearly to be distinguished from <em>Baker </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>183 Mass. 178.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">While, without objection, evidence was introduced that horses had been frightened, such an occurrence cannot be considered upon the evidence as an element of damage for which they were entitled to recover. This inconvenience was general in character, and not confined to those having occasion to trade with the tenants, but was a condition common to all driving horses in that vicinity. <em>Quincy Canal </em>v. <em>Newcomb, </em>7 Met. 276, 283.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-7\">An instruction that this circumstance did not diminish the commercial value of the property, but was outside of the liability of the respondent, thus became applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-8\">If, however, the request properly could have been given as framed, the refusal to rule in the language requested, when followed by an instruction to the same effect, was all that the respondent rightly could ask, and it has no just ground of exception. <em>Norwood </em>v. <em>Somerville, </em>159 Mass. 105, 112. <em>Graham </em>v. <em>Middleby, </em>185 Mass. 349, 354.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-9\">Upon looking at the ruling given, it appears that the jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>were instructed that no recovery could be bad for any injury suffered from this cause, and that the damages to be assessed must be confined strictly to acts which made the estate less available for the use to which it was adapted.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-3\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
