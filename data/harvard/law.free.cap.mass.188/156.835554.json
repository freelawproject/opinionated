From that decree the plaintiffs appealed. On June 27,1904, this court sent down the following rescript: \u201c Decree of March 8th, 1899, vacated; bill dismissed with costs to the defendant Griggs; exceptions overruled,\u201d which was duly entered on the docket of the clerk of the Superior Court on June 27, 1904.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b181-7\">On July 14, 1904, William A. Munroe, Esquire, entered his appearance for the defendant. After certain other proceedings, no further decree having been made, the plaintiffs on July 16, 1904, made a motion to amend from equity to law. On July 21, 1904, Lawton, J., before whom this motion to amend was heard, indorsed the following order on the motion: \u201c Norfolk, ss., Superior Court, Boston, July 21st, 1904. After hearing upon within motion, ordered that said motion be allowed upon the payment into court for the use of the defendant Griggs on or before August 3rd, 1904, the costs to date in accordance with the rescript taxed as in an action at law, and in addition thereto three term fees, otherwise motion is disallowed. By the Court sitting in Boston. Henry E. Bellew, Assistant Clerk.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b181-8\">Messrs. Brand\u00e9is, Dunbar and Nutter, counsel for the plaintiffs, and Mr. Munroe, counsel for the defendant, were unable to agree upon the amount of taxable costs. Thereupon Mr. Mun-roe notified Messrs. Brand\u00e9is, Dunbar 'and Nutter to appear in the equity motion session of the Superior Court for Suffolk County on August 3,1904, on the question of what costs were properly taxable under the order of <em>Lawton, </em>J. On August 3, 1904, George R. Nutter, Esquire, one of the counsel for the plaintiffs, and Albert H. Chamberlain, Esquire, then associated with Mr. Munroe, were present at the equity motion session of the Superior Court for Suffolk County, and Mr. Nutter at that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>time informed Mr. Chamberlain that he was prepared in behalf of the plaintiffs to pay the taxable costs in accordance with the order of the judge and was prepared to proceed with the hearing on the amount of the costs. Mr. Chamberlain stated that Mr. Munroe was ill, and requested that the payment be postponed and that the hearing on the question of the costs be continued to August 5, 1904. Thereupon on August 3, 1904, the following agreement in writing was entered into by Mr. Nutter in behalf of Brand\u00e9is, Dunbar and Nutter, counsel for the plaintiffs, by Mr. Chamberlain in behalf of Mr. Munroe, counsel for the defendant: \u201cCommonwealth of Massachusetts. Norfolk, ss. Superior Court in Equity. Lemuel Crossman <em>et al. vs. </em>Chas. A. Griggs. In the above entitled cause it is agreed that the time for the plaintiffs to pay the costs as provided in the order allowing the plaintiffs to amend the bill into an action at law may be extended to and including Friday, August 5,1904. Brand\u00e9is, Dunbar and Nutter, Attys. for Plaintiffs, William A. Munroe, Atty. for Griggs.\u201d The defendant had no knowledge of this extension of time and neither assented nor . dissented. On August 5, 1904, there was a hearing before <em>Fessenden, </em>J., in the equity motion session for Suffolk County on the amount of taxable costs, at which hearing Mr. Nutter appeared in behalf of the plaintiffs, and Mr. Munroe in behalf of the defendant, and the taxable costs then determined by the court were on that day, August 5, 1904, paid to the counsel for the defendant in behalf of the plaintiffs. \u2019This agreement was not presented to the court for allowance. It was filed with the clerk on August 5,1904, on which day the costs, amounting to $212.38, actually were paid as appears of record. The defendant still retains the costs so paid, and never has offered to return them or any part thereof to the plaintiffs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b182-5\">On August 20,1904, Mr. Munroe, having withdrawn his appearance for the defendant, and Vere Goldthwaite, Esquire, who had entered his appeai\u2019ance for the defendant on August 19,1904, and who had been absent in California at the time of the proceedings to amend into law, having returned from California, entered a general appearance and an answer to the plaintiffs\u2019 declaration in behalf of the defendant without actual knowledge of all of the terms of the order of the court dated July 21, 1904, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>allowing conditionally the amendment into law, although Mr. Goldthwaite knew that some order had been made allowing amendment into law. Later Mr. Goldthwaite, having learned of the terms of the order, on October 17, filed a motion to dismiss the action at law and a motion for a final decree.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b183-5\">On November 4, 1904, the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss the action at law and to enter a final decree were argued together before Bell, J., and the defendant thereupon asked the judge to rule in substance as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b183-6\">\u201c First. That the entry on the docket of this court made by the clerk on the 27th day of June, 1904, to wit: the entry of \u2018Decree of March 8th, 1899, vacated; bill dismissed with costs to the defendant Griggs; exceptions overruled,\u2019was itself, under all the circumstances of this case, a final decree and a final adjudication of this cause.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b183-7\">\u201cSecond. That, because the decree of this court made July 21,1904, was not, as appears by the record, complied with, this court now has no power to entertain any further proceedings with respect to said cause except a motion for a final decree in more extended form, which motion and decree in more extended form is before it for allowance.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b183-8\">\u201c Third. That the order of this court dated July 21, 1904, as appears of record, to wit: \u2018 Plff\u2019s motion to amend from equity to law allowed upon payment into court for use of deft. Griggs on or before August 3rd, 1904, costs to date in accordance with rescript taxed as an action at law and in addition thereto three term fees, otherwise motion is disallowed,\u2019 was an order upon an express condition, to wit: upon the condition of the payment into court for the use of the defendant Griggs on or before August 3rd, 1904, costs (as set forth in said order) that said costs were not paid into court on or before August 3rd, 1904, as appears of record, and that therefore the motion to amend was disallowed and the plaintiffs have no action at law now pending against the defendant before this court; or if they have, it be dismissed for the reasons above stated and the final decree allowed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b183-9\">\u201cFourth. That the record of this court cannot be changed by an agreement of the parties or their attorneys, as undertaken in this case, without an order of court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b184-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>\u201c Fifth. That the general appearance, answer and other proceedings taken by the defendant in this case since August 3, 1904, do not have the effect to estop the defendant from any proceedings which might have been had by him in the premises after the entry of the rescript from the full court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b184-5\">\u201cSixth. That because the order of court referred to in the third request for rulings of the defendant was not complied with, the case now stands as if the plaintiffs\u2019 motion to amend from equity to law had never been made.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b184-6\">The judge refused to make any of these rulings and the defendant excepted. The case then being before the judge upon its merits, the defendant offered no evidence to disprove the plaintiffs\u2019 claims for the several amounts set out in the declaration, with the exception of the sum of $400 for use and occupation contained in the seventh clause thereof, which the plaintiffs waived, but the defendant asked the judge to rule:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b184-7\">\u201c Seventh. That the various issues joined in this case have each and all been adjudicated, as appears of record in this court, and that there must be a judgment for the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b184-8\">\u201c Eighth. That if there is an action of law now pending against the defendant in the premises, the cause thereof happened more than six years before the commencing of said action at law as appears of record in this court, and is therefore barred by the statute of limitations, and there must be judgment for the defendant.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b184-9\">The judge refused to rule as requested. He found for the plaintiffs, at first in the sum of $28,949.88 which he subsequently reduced to $24,516.26, the amount of the <em>ad damnum </em>of the writ being $25,000. See <em>Crossman </em>v. <em>Griggs, post, </em>217. The defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b184-10\"><em>V. Goldthwaite, </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b184-11\"><em>J. B. Studley, </em>( <em>G. R. Nutter </em>with him,) for the plaintiffs.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b184-12\">Knowlton, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"Adk\">The rescript \u201c Bill dismissed,\u201d and the docket entry in pursuance of it, were not a final decree which precluded further action in the case. The court had power to allow an amendment changing the suit in equity into an action at law. This was expressly decided after full consideration in a similar case. <em>Merrill </em>v. <em>Beckwith, </em>168 Mass. 72.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-13\">The order authorizing the amendment was complied with. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>Under the circumstances, the fact that the payment of costs was not made on the day mentioned in the order is immaterial. The defendant, on August 5, 1904, having knowledge by his attorney of all the facts, accepted the costs, the payment of which was made the condition of allowing the amendment, and he still retains them. Whether he had personal knowledge or not, he is bound by the knowledge of his attorney. <em>Sartwell </em>v. <em>North, </em>144 Mass. 188. Afterwards he filed a general appearance and an answer to the declaration at law. This conduct in itself ought to be held a waiver of his right to object that the original condition stated in the order was not complied with literally.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-4\">The condition as to payment of costs at the prescribed time was for the benefit of the defendant, and he might waive it by an extension of the time, or, otherwise. A valid agreement in writing for an extension of the time was made by the attorneys of the parties and subsequently filed with the papers in the case. There is express statutory authority for similar agreements in the R. L. c. 173, \u00a7\u00a7 69, 70. See also <em>Wieland </em>v. <em>White, </em>109 Mass. 392; <em>Moulton </em>v. <em>Bowker, </em>115 Mass. 36; <em>Shattuck </em>v. <em>Bill, </em>142 Mass. 56.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-13\">\n<em>Bxceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
