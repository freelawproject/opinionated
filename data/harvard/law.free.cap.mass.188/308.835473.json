L. c. 208, \u00a7 26, the defendant under R.

The jury returned a verdict of guilty; and the defendant alleged exceptions. The second ruling requested by the defendant, his exception to the refusal of which is sustained by the court, is stated in the last paragraph of the opinion. The other exceptions are made immaterial by the decision of the court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b333-6\"><em>A. S. Phillips &amp; W. H.

L. c. 208, \u00a7 26, and not the distinct offence described in \u00a7 61 of the same chapter. Under \u00a7 26 the offence may be proved by showing a false pretence, as well as in the other ways specified. Section 61, as amended by the St. of 1902, c. 544, \u00a7 29, describes a specific offence, which is the obtaining of goods and chattels \u201c by a false pretence of carrying on business and dealing in the ordinary course of trade.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b333-9\">The only question which we need consider relates to the question of venue. It appears that the flour in question was shipped from the West to Fall River, in Bristol County, and was there received by the defendant. It never was in Suffolk County. It is provided by the R. L. c. 218, \u00a7 47: \u201c Larceny, whether at common law or as defined by section twenty-six of chapter two hundred and eight, may be prosecuted and punished in any county in which the defendant had possession of the property which is alleged to have been stolen.\u201d ' The language here is plain, and clearly points out the place where an offence either at common law or under the R. L. c. 208, \u00a7 26, is to be punished. The government relies upon the broad language of the R. L. c. 218, \u00a7 48. But this applies only to the old form of an indictment for obtaining goods by false pretences, and to the offence described in the R. L. c. 208, \u00a7 28, neither of which applies- in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>\u25a0 The second request of the defendant, which was in effect that the defendant could not be punished in Suffolk County if Bristol County was the place where the goods actually came into the possession of the defendant, therefore should have been granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">\n<em>Exceptions sustained.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
