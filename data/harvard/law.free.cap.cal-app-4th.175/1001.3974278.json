Code,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u00a7 6600 et seq.) to commit Allen L. Fields to the State Department of Mental Health (the Department) for an indeterminate term of involuntary treatment. After a trial, a jury found that Fields was a sexually violent predator (SVP), and the court committed him to the Department for an indeterminate term.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-8\">On appeal, Fields contends that the SVPA, as amended in 2006, violates state and federal constitutional guarantees of equal protection and due process. He further claims that the trial court committed prejudicial error in limiting defense counsel\u2019s ability to question the People\u2019s expert witnesses with respect to the administration and results of a polygraph examination that was administered to Fields as part of his treatment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b882-9\">We reject Fields\u2019s constitutional claims. Further, we conclude that any error the court may have made in limiting defense counsel\u2019s questioning of the People\u2019s experts concerning the polygraph examination was harmless. We therefore affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-10\">n.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-11\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b882-12\">On November 3, 2006, the People filed an amended petition seeking to recommit Fields as an SVP within the meaning of the SVPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-13\">Fields was convicted of molesting four boys, all under the age of 14. In 1983, Fields was convicted of two counts of committing a lewd act upon a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1005\">*1005</page-number>child under the age of 14, for which he was sentenced to three years in prison. Fields molested two other boys in 1987. In 1988, after being charged with 93 counts of child molestation and possession of child pornography, Fields pleaded guilty to two counts of committing a lewd act upon a child under the age of 14, and two counts of committing forcible child molestation. Fields was sentenced to prison for 25 years.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-5\">During some of these crimes, Fields bound his victims, using restraints that were attached to Fields\u2019s bed. During his encounters with one of his victims, Fields would look toward some guns that were mounted on Fields\u2019s wall if the victim refused to participate in sexual acts with him. On one occasion, Fields fired a speargun through a piece of paper and said to the victim, \u201cImagine what that would do to you.\u201d At the time, Fields believed he was in love with that victim, and went so far as to name that victim as the beneficiary of his fife insurance policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-6\">In 2003, Fields underwent a bilateral orchiectomy, or the surgical removal of his testes. Fields\u2019s family paid for the surgery. At trial, the parties placed significant focus on this fact and the question whether, after such surgery, it remained likely that Fields would engage in sexually violent criminal behavior if released.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-7\">Three mental health experts, Dr. Dawn Starr, Dr. Robert Owen and Dr. Doriann Hughes, all of whom are psychologists, testified for the People. Dr. Starr opined that Fields suffers from pedophilia, sexual sadism, and personality disorder with narcissistic and histrionic features. Dr. Owen testified that Fields suffers from \u201ca severe case of pedophilia,\u201d and also from a personality disorder with narcissistic and dependent features. Both Drs. Starr and Owen testified that Fields is likely to engage in sexually violent predatory criminal behavior in the future if released. The doctors also questioned the validity of the few studies that have been done concerning physical castration and sexual offense recidivism.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-8\">Dr. Hughes treats sexual offenders, including Fields, at Coalinga State Hospital. Dr. Hughes had been meeting with Fields in group sessions twice weekly. Dr. Hughes described the sex offender treatment program in which Fields had been participating. The program consists of five progressive treatment stages called \u201cphases.\u201d Dr. Hughes discussed Fields\u2019s treatment progress. She noted that he was currently in phase n, but that it was her opinion that Fields very recently became ready to move to phase III. Dr. Hughes testified that she felt \u201cpretty strongly\u201d that Fields needs to go through phase HI of the treatment program before being released, because he \u201cstill has a long way to go working through some of these problem behaviors, high risks and characteristics that have been problematic for him in the past.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b884-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1006\">*1006</page-number>Fields testified in his own defense. He described being molested by his father when he was a child, and admitted that he had restrained his victims using soft restraints. Fields explained that he had voluntarily undergone surgery resulting in his physical castration. Fields stated that he no longer had deviant sexual fantasies or urges, and said that his behavior and thought patterns had changed since the time he molested his victims. Fields described his perception of his progress in treatment and explained that if released, he intended to move to Minnesota, where he would temporarily live with his sister and brother-in-law and would voluntarily continue outpatient treatment through Pathway Psychological Services.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-5\">Fields called Dr. Robert Hal\u00f3n, a psychologist, to testify as an expert witness for the defense. Dr. Hal\u00f3n testified that he did not believe that Fields posed a serious risk of reoffending, and opined that Fields did not meet the SVP standards. Specifically, according to Dr. Hal\u00f3n, there is a lack of evidence that Fields suffers from a \u201ccurrently diagnosed mental disorder.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b884-6\">Dr. Mary Flavan, a psychiatrist, also testified for the defense. Dr. Flavan testified that she had spoken with Fields about chemical and physical castration while he was a patient at Atascadero State Hospital. Dr. Flavan had not conducted an evaluation of Fields prior to testifying. While she was working at Atascadero State Hospital and counseling sex offenders, Dr. Flavan compiled literature on the effectiveness of surgical castration on sexual offense recidivism. Dr. Flavan testified that physical castration is \u201cvery effective\u201d at preventing recidivism in sexually violent offenders, and noted that some studies demonstrated a recidivism rate of between 1 and 3 percent. Dr. Flavan testified that in her opinion, a sexual offender with characteristics like Fields\u2019s who has undergone an orchiectomy should be released.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-7\">On May 2, 2008, a jury found Fields to be an SVP. The trial court ordered Fields committed to the Department for an indeterminate term.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-8\">IH.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b884-10\">A., B.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b885-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1007\">*1007</page-number>C. <em>The polygraph examination</em></p>\n<p id=\"b885-5\">Fields contends that the trial court abused its discretion in limiting defense counsel\u2019s cross-examination of the People\u2019s experts with regard to a polygraph examination that was administered to Fields as part of the treatment process in which he was voluntarily participating during his commitment.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-6\">1. <em>Additional background</em></p>\n<p id=\"b885-7\">On April 22, 2008, during defense counsel\u2019s cross-examination of Dr. Starr, counsel asked, \u201cAre you aware of whether or not Mr. Fields has undergone a polygraph examination at either Atascadero or Coalinga State Hospital?\u201d Dr. Starr replied, \u201cYes, he did.\u201d The prosecutor immediately inquired of the trial court, \u201cMay we approach, Your Honor?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b885-8\">Outside the presence of the jury, the prosecutor stated, \u201cYour Honor, [defense counsel] wants to ask about the results of a polygraph exam. He is well aware that\u2019s not admissible, and I would object.\u201d Defense counsel responded, \u201cI am not seeking to admit the results themselves. I am intending on asking the witness whether her\u2014[(1)] [if] she is aware of my client having submitted to such an examination, and, [(2)], whether his having submitted to such an examination bears on her opinion.\u201d The following colloquy then occurred:</p>\n<p id=\"b885-9\">\u201c[Prosecutor]: Your Honor, even the fact somebody takes a polygraph examination is not to be referred to in a court of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-10\">\u201cThe Court: In this state.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-11\">\u201c[Prosecutor]: In this state, yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-12\">\u201c[Defense counsel]: It\u2019s part of the treatment program, Judge. That\u2019s why they do it.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-13\">\u201cThe Court: This isn\u2019t a probation revocation case where someone is ordered to take a polygraph as a term and condition of probation so we could monitor their inner, secret thoughts.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-14\">\u201c[Defense counsel]: But it is part of the treatment program in trying to ascertain whether an offender is making full disclosures of a number of victims, the nature of their offenses and whether they have otherwise complied with the treatment program itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-15\">\u201c[Prosecutor]: My position, that\u2019s all . . . beside the point. It is not supposed to be referred to in a court of law and mention that anybody took it, or the results are not supposed to be mentioned.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1008\">*1008</page-number>\u201cThe Court: Do you have some case law that supports your position, [defense counsel], since I am not aware of one? Do you have a case?</p>\n<p id=\"b886-5\">\u201c[Defense counsel]: I don\u2019t have a case handy.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-6\">\u201cThe Court: Well, handy or is there a case?</p>\n<p id=\"b886-7\">\u201c[Defense counsel]: I don\u2019t know whether there is such a case.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-8\">\u201cThe Court: I see. [][]... [][]</p>\n<p id=\"b886-9\">\u201cThe Court: . . . [][] We are still discussing the polygraph. The law is what the law is. And I am not aware of any case authority that allows the introduction of the polygraph issue in an S.V.P. case.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-10\">\u201c[Defense counsel]: This may be the case that makes that law.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-11\">\u201cThe Court: I don\u2019t think so, so I will sustain the objection. I will instruct the jury to disregard the question.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b886-12\">The court thereafter instructed the jury to disregard \u201cthe last question and answer.\u201d Neither attorney asked Dr. Starr any further questions regarding the polygraph examination. Late in the day, the prosecutor called Dr. Owen to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-13\">At the start of the proceedings the following day, outside of the presence of the jury, defense counsel moved to be permitted to ask the remaining experts about the polygraph examination: Defense counsel filed a document entitled, \u201cMemorandum of Points and Authorities in Support of the Admission of Evidence [of] the Polygraph,\u201d and referred to a \u201cPolygraph Examination Report\u201d to inform the court about the three substantive questions Fields had been asked during his polygraph examination. The first question was, \u201cHave you ever used a weapon to force a victim to engage in a sexual activity.\u201d Fields responded, \u201cNo.\u201d The second question was, \u201cDo you have other victim profile types you have not disclosed since starting treatment?\u201d Fields responded, \u201cNo.\u201d The third question was, \u201cHave you had a deviant sexual fantasy since July of 2004?\u201d Fields responded, \u201cNo.\u201d The polygraph examiner \u201cfound that Mr. Fields\u2019 polygraph charts did not display significant or unresolved physiological reactions to the relevant questions,\u201d and opined that Fields\u2019s answers were truthful.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-14\">Defense counsel noted that he was asking the court to allow him to inquire of Dr. Owen and of Fields about \u201cthe substance of this examination as reflected in the report,\u201d and as to \u201cwhether Mr. Fields submitted to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1009\">*1009</page-number>polygraph examination as a prerequisite to entry into the Phase HI program of the Sex Offender Commitment Program . . . .\u201d Counsel argued that Fields\u2019s \u201csubmission to the examination was in compliance with the program requirements\u2014and I think, therefore, is both relevant and probative.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b887-5\">The prosecutor objected, arguing that defense counsel had failed to \u201ccite a case which stands for the proposition that a polygraph examination is admissible in a sexually violent predator case.\u201d The prosecutor also argued that defense counsel wanted the jurors to know that Fields had submitted to the polygraph examination in order to imply that Fields passed the examination, and this, the prosecutor contended, was \u201ctotally improper.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b887-6\">The trial court noted that the issue was one that would properly be the subject of an in limine motion, and that defense counsel had not filed such a motion. The court went on to state that evidence relating to polygraph examinations, including the results of those examinations, \u201care admissible in civil cases in California on some conditions . . . .\u201d The court noted that if the parties stipulate to the admission of polygraph evidence, then such evidence may be admitted. Further, even in the absence of a stipulation, polygraph evidence may be admissible if \u201cthe party offering the polygraph is able to lay the foundation required by <em>Kelly-Frye </em>per scientific evidence\u201d and if the court determines that the evidence is more probative than prejudicial pursuant to Evidence Code section 352. The court proceeded to recite the facts of a number of cases that involved the question of the admissibility of polygraph evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-7\">After discussing these cases, the court noted that the law prohibits the use of polygraph evidence in criminal cases, but that it is not clear whether that evidentiary rule applies to polygraph evidence in the context of an SVP trial, which, according to the trial court, is considered a \u201cquasi-civil\u201d proceeding. The trial court stated, \u201cIt is an unknown question or there is no answer to the question, \u2018Are polygraphs allowed in a S.V.P. case?\u2019 There is no case law on that point.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b887-8\">Noting that Evidence Code section 351.1 \u201ccategorically prohibits polygraph evidence\u201d in a criminal case, the trial court stated, \u201c[A]bsent some case that says that a polygraph should be admissible in an S.V.P. proceeding, I am not going to allow it. In addition to that, and more fundamental, quite frankly, in the analysis of this issue is that we have had no testimony from Dr. Starr\u2014 we haven\u2019t finished with Dr. Owen, of course, but neither of the witnesses called by the People so far have testified they used the information of this polygraph examination to formulate their opinions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b888-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1010\">*1010</page-number>The court expressed concern that \u201cthere has been no scientific acceptance of the reliability of the test, the polygraph test or the lie detector test for determining whether a subject is being truthful or not.\u201d The court then stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b888-5\">\u201cIf there was case law holding that the polygraph and the lie detector test was admissible, a holding that an S.V.P. is a strictly civil proceeding, is not a civil quasi [jz'c], slash, criminal proceeding, and you could properly bring a motion in limine to lay the foundation required by the <em>Kelly-Frye </em>test, and based on what was provided, the court then indicated you had met your burden under <em>Kelly-Frye, </em>then we go to the 352 analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-6\">\u201cAnd I can\u2019t speculate how I would rule on that because that\u2019s not before the court at this time. There is nothing to prohibit you from calling Mr. Fields to the stand and asking Mr. Fields, you know, ... the three questions that were posed by the examiner.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b888-7\">Defense counsel eventually moved for an Evidence Code section 402 hearing as to Dr. Owen. The court said, \u201cWe can do that right now.\u201d Defense counsel then asked, \u201cI understand the court\u2019s remarks to extend to results of the polygraph examination. Do[] the court\u2019s remarks also extend to the fact that Mr. Fields complied with program requirements in submitting to it?\u201d The following colloquy then occurred:</p>\n<p id=\"b888-8\">\u201cThe Court: That\u2019s a different issue. I don\u2019t know\u2014and I have done a lot of S.V.P. trials over the last ten years that I have been on the bench. I have never heard to the best of my recollection\u2014sometimes I forget things or I have a failure of recollection, but I have never heard to the best of my recollection\u2014[that there is a] requirement that someone submit to a polygraph test as a condition to go from one phase of the S.V.P. treatment program to another phase; I never heard of that before.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b888-9\">\u201c[Defense counsel]: I understand Dr. Hughes has knowledge of that requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-10\">\u201cThe Court: Dr. Hughes?</p>\n<p id=\"b888-11\">\u201c[Defense counsel]: Dr. Doriann Hughes who [the prosecutor] intends on calling after Dr. Owen.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-12\">\u201cThe Court: Maybe he won\u2019t call Dr. Hughes now. I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know. I\u2019ve never heard that before. I don\u2019t know.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-13\">\u201c[Defense counsel]: Well, I think it appropriate\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b889-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1011\">*1011</page-number>\u201cThe Court: Did you have some written manual that indicates that a polygraph examination is required?</p>\n<p id=\"b889-5\">\u201c[Defense counsel]: I don\u2019t know. I will look.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-6\">\u201cThe Court: On top of that, you remember you brought an in limine motion to the effect that you didn\u2019t want any information [that] your client ostensibly said in confidence to be used against him? This is an S.V.P. trial. You can\u2019t have it both ways.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-7\">\u201c[Defense counsel]: Right, but we never reached that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-8\">\u201cThe Court: Well, we did reach that issue. I said no.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-9\">\u201c[Defense counsel]: Well, I still have a tactical decision with regard to disclosures, and I have made my tactical decision to this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-10\">\u201cThe Court: Okay. [][] Let\u2019s conduct a 402 hearing as to Dr. Owen as to whether he used and formulated his opinion [with] the information that was gleaned from this polygraph examination, a lie detector examination, [f] And, quite frankly, we don\u2019t have the person who did the examination here: We do not have a report as to the questions, the context, et cetera, and absent a videotape of that to verify, that\u2019s another issue that may come up.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b889-11\">The court then held a hearing pursuant to Evidence Code section 402. Defense counsel began the examination, and engaged in the following colloquy with Dr. Owen:</p>\n<p id=\"b889-12\">\u201cQ. Among the records that you have reviewed concerning Mr. Fields in preparation for preparing reports in this matter, have you reviewed a polygraph examination report reflecting a polygraph examination administered at Atascadero State Hospital on August 10, 2005?</p>\n<p id=\"b889-13\">\u201cA. Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-14\">\u201cQ. And did you consider the results of that examination in forming your opinion?</p>\n<p id=\"b889-15\">\u201cA. I considered, but gave limited weight to the results.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-16\">\u201cQ. And that consideration was part of the formation of your opinion in this case?</p>\n<p id=\"b889-17\">\u201cA. Yes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b890-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1012\">*1012</page-number>The prosecutor then began his questioning of Dr. Owen:</p>\n<p id=\"b890-5\">\u201c[Prosecutor]: . . . Why did you give limited weight to the results?</p>\n<p id=\"b890-6\">\u201c[Defense counsel]: Objection; relevance.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-7\">\u201c[Prosecutor]: Okay.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-8\">\u201cThe Court: Relevance?</p>\n<p id=\"b890-9\">\u201c[Defense counsel]: This is not a hearing to determine the weight that the expert gave to the examination report; it is to determine whether or not it was part of the materials he relied upon in forming his opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-10\">\u201cThe Court: I disagree. You asked the question. You opened the door. Overruled.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b890-11\">\u201cThe Witness: I gave limited weight to it for a variety of reasons. [(1)], the polygraphs have not been shown to be reliable methods of assessing the truth. [(2)], the particular polygraph examination seemed to omit extremely important questions, such as were there any other victims. [][] But primarily, it is a lack of reliability and validity with this instrument that gave me concern. Nonetheless, I considered it as I considered all documents in the file. But the question is, how much weight do I give to those particular documents or assessments? In this case, very limited.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b890-12\">Defense counsel then asked Dr. Owen whether he \u201cg[a]ve consideration to the denial by Mr. Fields which was found truthful by the examiner that he did not have other victim types,\u201d to which Dr. Owen responded, \u201cYes.\u201d The prosecutor clarified with Dr. Owen that when he said that he \u201c \u2018considered\u2019 \u201d Fields\u2019s denial, he gave it \u201cvery limited weight\u201d for the reasons he had already stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-13\">The court then heard argument from the attorneys. Defense counsel stated that he believed the \u201cquestion ha[d] now shifted from one of admissibility to one of weight for the jury.\u201d The prosecutor disagreed, arguing that Dr. Owen had essentially said that he gave the results of Fields\u2019s polygraph examination no weight, and complaining that \u201cthe only purpose for doing this is to communicate to the jury he passed an exam, which is not scientifically reliable and they are hoping to rely on it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b890-14\">The trial court ruled as follows: \u201cMy previous ruling remains the same. Again\u2014and even Dr. Owen just testified, it is not reliable to assess the truth in an examination given, [and it] omitted a very important question as to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1013\">*1013</page-number>other victims, ffl Again, there is no scientific acceptance of reliability for the test in determining whether a subject is being truthful or not. And that\u2019s consistent with the case law that has come down on that point. [][]... [f] .. . There has been no foundation laid under <em>Kelly-Frye </em>to where the court would obtain it [sic], if I were to assume this is a civil proceeding. The decision remains the same.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b891-5\">Defense counsel stated that he \u201cwish[ed] to reserve reconsideration of the issue if [the prosecutor] calls Dr. Hughes to testify because I think Dr. Hughes is the only witness for the petitioner who has personal knowledge of the program requirements, and I remain interested in eliciting the operative fact that submission to a polygraph is a program requirement.\u201d After hearing from the prosecutor on this point, the court stated, \u201cBased on what I have heard so far, I will deny [defense counsel\u2019s] motion. It is denied without prejudice. If he can pull a rabbit out of a hat somehow, we will see what happens.\u201d Neither attorney asked Dr. Owen about the polygraph examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-6\">The following morning, April 24, outside the presence of the jury, defense counsel raised the issue of another Evidence Code section 402 hearing regarding Dr. Hughes\u2019s ability to testify that Fields had completed a polygraph examination during his treatment. The following colloquy occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b891-7\">\u201c[Defense counsel]: I want a 402 hearing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b891-8\">\u201cThe Court: As to who[m]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b891-9\">\u201c[Defense counsel]: Doriann Hughes, the petitioner\u2019s next witness.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b891-10\">\u201cThe Court: Why didn\u2019t you tell me yesterday afternoon?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b891-11\">\u201c[Defense counsel]: I think I had told you yesterday morning that I wanted to revisit the issue of whether the polygraph examination was a condition of staffing for phase III through Doriann Hughes. [][]... [][]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b891-12\">\u201c[Prosecutor]: All I can represent to Your Honor as far as whether we should have a 402 hearing\u2014I will submit, Your Honor, on that issue. I honestly\u2014I don\u2019t think that\u2014my position hasn\u2019t changed, I will just tell you that. I think counsel can accomplish what he wants to accomplish if this helps you\u2014apparently his goal is to let the jurors know that Mr. Fields is complying with departmental policies. That seems to be the whole purpose of it. The stated purpose is not to admit the results of the polygraph, although Dr. Hughes\u2014I have asked her, yes, they have to take a polygraph in order to phase through, but that what Dr. Hughes is also prepared to testify under oath is that Dr. Hughes [sic] complies to [sic] all of the conditions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b892-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1014\">*1014</page-number>\u201cAnd I see her nodding \u2018yes.\u2019 That seems to be the goal he wants to bring before the jury, and it seems to me it can be accomplished that way.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b892-5\">\u201cThe Court: [Defense counsel]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b892-6\">\u201c[Defense counsel]: That is what I would intend to elicit at a 402, is that the polygraph is a mandatory condition of staffing for phase III and that Mr. Fields has complied with that condition, which I regard as an operative fact as I argued yesterday morning.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b892-7\">\u201cThe Court: I still don\u2019t follow your argument as to an operative fact, but we will hear from the doctor, the witness.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b892-8\">The court proceeded to hold an Evidence Code section 402 hearing during which Dr. Hughes discussed the use of a polygraph examination during the multiphase treatment process for SVP\u2019s. Specifically, Dr. Hughes stated that one of the requirements for an individual to \u201cget from phase II to phase III\u201d is to \u201csubmit to a polygraph.\u201d Dr. Hughes also clarified, however, that \u201c[flailing a polygraph wouldn\u2019t preclude [an individual in treatment] from going over to phase III. There might be treatment issues that come[] from a failing of the polygraph, and it would be discussed with his phase providers and would be an issue during the staffing; however, it wouldn\u2019t necessarily prevent him from going on to phase III.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b892-9\">When asked whether she \u201cpersonally reifies] on polygraphs, in general,\u201d Dr. Hughes stated, \u201cI think it can be used as a treatment tool, but obviously there are problems with the polygraph and it is not supported through research. So it is a tool, but it is not something we heavily rely on.\u201d Dr. Hughes testified that she believed that Fields was presently ready to move to phase III of treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-10\">When the attorneys and the court finished their questioning of Dr. Hughes, the court held a conference with counsel in chambers. The conference was not reported. After returning from the conference, the court stated on the record: \u201cWe are back in session in this matter. All parties are present, yet we are outside the presence of the jury panel, and Dr. Hughes is present. [][] For the record, there was an unreported chambers conference with counsel, and I have decided to modify my previous ruling as to the polygraph issue. And counsel know what the court has indicated. Counsel can proceed accordingly.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b892-11\">The prosecutor elicited testimony from Dr. Hughes regarding the phases of the sex offender treatment program in general, as well as Fields\u2019s participation and progress in the treatment program. During cross-examination, defense counsel asked Dr. Hughes about the use of a polygraph examination in Fields\u2019s treatment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b893-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1015\">*1015</page-number>\u201cQ. ...['][] In regard to Mr. Fields being ready for the staffing panel to go into phase HI, was he mandatorily required to submit to a polygraph examination?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b893-5\">\u201cA. Yes, he was.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b893-6\">\u201cQ. Did he, in fact, submit to one on or about August 10, 2005, at Atascadero State Hospital?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b893-7\">\u201cA. I believe so. I don\u2019t know the date, but I know he did have one at Atascadero.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b893-8\">\u201cQ. Fair enough. [H] Was there anything about the result of the polygraph examination that prevented him from moving on to phase III?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b893-9\">\u201cA. No.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b893-10\">Defense counsel then began asking Dr. Hughes about the amount and type of work required of individuals participating in phase H versus phase HI. Neither attorney questioned Dr. Hughes any further on the issue of the polygraph examination.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b893-11\">During Fields\u2019s testimony, his attorney asked him the same questions that he had been asked during the polygraph examination:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b893-12\">\u201cQ. Okay. Have you ever used a weapon to force a victim to engage in sexual activity?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b893-13\">\u201cA. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b893-14\">\u201cQ. Do you have any other victim profile types you have not disclosed since starting treatment?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b893-15\">\u201cA. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b893-16\">\u201cQ. Have you had a deviant sexual fantasy since July of 2004?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b893-17\">\u201cA.

However, Evidence Code section 351.1 does not speak to the use of polygraph evidence in proceedings outside the context of criminal proceedings, and we have found no statutory or judicially created bar to a party offering polygraph evidence in civil proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-5\">Proceedings under the SVPA are \u201c \u2018civil commitment\u2019 proceedings [established] in order to provide \u2018treatment\u2019 to mentally disordered individuals who cannot control sexually violent criminal behavior.\u201d <em>(Hubbart v.

In the particular circumstances of this case, however, we need not determine whether the trial court erred in preventing defense counsel from inquiring further of the prosecution\u2019s experts as to their consideration of the polygraph examination report in reaching their opinions about the likelihood that Fields would engage in sexually violent predatory behavior if released, because we conclude that there is no reasonable probability that the jury would have reached a different result if the court had permitted defense counsel to inquire further of the experts about the polygraph examination report.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-5\">\u201cIt is . .. well settled that the erroneous admission or exclusion of evidence does not require reversal except where the error or errors caused a miscarriage of justice.

Watson </em>(1956) 46 Cal.2d 818, 836 [299 P.2d 243]].) In applying this prejudicial error standard, we conclude that there is no reasonable probability that Fields would have obtained a more favorable result if the court had permitted defense counsel to inquire further of the prosecution\u2019s experts regarding the substance of the polygraph examination report.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-6\">First, Fields\u2019s counsel was able to present, through other means, much of the information that jurors might have gleaned if defense counsel had been allowed to inquire about the polygraph examination. For example, Fields testified about these very matters at trial. Fields\u2019s attorney asked him the same questions that he was asked during the polygraph examination, and he gave the same responses. Thus, to the extent that Fields may have wanted to jury to know that he had not used weapons to force his victims to have sex with him, that he had no additional victim types, or that he had not had a deviant sexual fantasy since July of 2004, he was able to get that information in evidence through his testimony, albeit without the added value of the report\u2019s conclusion that these statements were \u201ctruthful.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b896-7\">Further, Fields\u2019s counsel would not have been able to use the substance of the polygraph examination in the way that Fields likely wanted to use it\u2014that is, as proof that he was being truthful in stating that he had not used weapons in committing his crimes, that he did not have other victim types, and/or that he had not had any deviant fantasies between July 2004 and the time of the polygraph examination. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Gardeley </em>(1996) 14 Cal.4th 605, 619 [59 Cal.Rptr.2d 356, 927 P.2d 713] [\u201c[A] witness\u2019s on-the-record recitation of sources relied on for an expert opinion does not transform inadmissible <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1019\">*1019</page-number>matter into \u2018independent proof\u2019 of any fact. [Citations.]\u201d].) Rather, counsel\u2019s use of the polygraph evidence would have been limited to helping the jury assess the weight to be given to the experts\u2019 opinions. However, the experts had already acknowledged that Fields\u2019s castration would have the effect of diminishing both his sex drive and his sexual fantasies. In fact, Dr. Stan-acknowledged in her testimony that she believed Fields when he said that he had not had deviant sexual fantasies since his castration. However, she still believed that Fields was likely to commit further sexually violent predatory acts if released prior to completing all five stages of SVP treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-5\">Fields also presented a large amount of evidence showing that his castration resulted in a decrease in his sex drive and his deviant sexual fantasies. Thus, the fact that a polygraph examiner concluded that Fields was being truthful in responding \u201cno\u201d to the question whether he had had a deviant sexual fantasy since his castration would not have provided the jury with any significant additional information.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-6\">Dr. Flavan described the effects of physical castration as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b897-7\">\u201cA. The principal effects of physical castration are de-sexualization or elimination of the sexual urge and sterilization because you can no longer make sperm.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-8\">\u201cQ. What does \u2018de-sexualization\u2019 mean?</p>\n<p id=\"b897-9\">\u201cA. Well, what goes first is ejaculation and then submission and then no longer being interested in actually having any sexual activities. That is de-sexualization. Sterilization, of course means no children.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b897-10\">Dr. Owen acknowledged that the orchiectomy was \u201ca major protective factor,\u201d meaning that it was \u201csomething that would reduce [Fields\u2019s] level of risk of reoffending.\u201d Dr. Owen stated, \u201cIt is a good thing for him. It would make him safer in the community,\u201d and explained, \u201cI think it is just common sense, thought,] that when you remove the testes from a man, that his sexual drive is going to go down substantially. That\u2019s what happened here. I certainly view it that way, that his risk of reoffending has gone down because of his surgery.\u201d Further, Fields testified about the relationship between his sex drive, his sexual fantasies, and his masturbation habits as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b897-11\">\u201cQ. And do you associate your sex drive with sexual fantasies?</p>\n<p id=\"b897-12\">\u201cA. Absolutely.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-13\">\u201cQ. What is the relationship in your mind?</p>\n<p id=\"b898-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1020\">*1020</page-number>\u201cA. Without the sex drive, I don\u2019t have sexual fantasies. They are one in the same. I don\u2019t\u2014If I am not masturbating, I don\u2019t have sexual fantasies. If I am having sexual fantasies, I am masturbating.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b898-5\">He later said, \u201cIf I am not masturbating\u2014all of my deviant fantasies involve masturbation. Once my mastubatorial habits\u2014once the Lupron[<footnotemark>13</footnotemark>] and castration were there, I no longer had any of my deviant fantasies. Since July, I guess it is of \u201903\u2014I am pretty sure it was January, but I had agreed that July 1st was the start of it\u2014I haven\u2019t had any fantasies that were deviant like that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b898-6\">None of the experts challenged Fields\u2019s contention that he had not had any deviant sexual fantasies since his castration. As noted above, Dr. Starr stated that she believed Fields when he said that he was no longer having deviant sexual fantasies. For example, Dr. Starr testified: \u201cSo his account of his sex drive over time changes, [f] So I\u2019m not exactly clear where it is now, but at the present time, he is saying he has not had any deviant sexual interest or fantasies. And I think that in terms of his conscious awareness, I think that is true.\u201d Even the prosecutor acknowledged that castration would result in a reduction in one\u2019s sexual urges. During closing argument, the prosecutor said, \u201cThere is no doubt, obviously [an orchiectomy] does that [i.e., reduces testosterone levels], and reduces his sex drive. Do you need an expert to tell you that? That\u2019s obvious. It\u2019s clear.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b898-7\">The prosecution\u2019s experts addressed these issues and explained why, in their opinions, the lack of deviant sexual fantasies, and the fact that Fields had undergone the orchiectomy, were insufficient to convince them that Fields no longer posed a sexual threat to young boys. Fields\u2019s pedophilic disorder was unusual in that Fields became very attached to at least one of his victims, even falling in love with that victim. Further, Fields\u2019s inability to relate well with adults, which the experts noted was something that had not changed much during Fields\u2019s incarceration or commitment, made him more of a risk for repeating his past conduct if released. Dr. Owen explained; \u201cMr. Fields would be aroused at times and would ejaculate, having erections, showing the level of excitement these boys seemed to bring him. He was fixated on boys, couldn\u2019t relate very well with adults; he felt more comfortable with boys. He was essentially a boy lover and spent time with the boys and fell in love with the boy\u2014with [R.] [][] It is with extreme cases I see to actually fall in love with a boy like this. He would go through great manipulations to perpetrate his crimes. He would lie to people, deceive people, manipulate people to get access to the boys.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b899-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1021\">*1021</page-number>Dr. Starr identified similar issues that continued to make Fields a risk for reoffending, despite the orchiectomy:</p>\n<p id=\"b899-5\">\u201cThe kinds of crimes he committed, he has described, involve[d] sadistic fantasies, fantasies of control or domination. These are not things that require testosterone. In fact, he also has talked about it was as much the relationship with these boys as it was the sexual part, [f] So even though sex was a part of it, there are all these other facts that would continue to predispose him to trying to\u2014and his continued poor interpersonal skills, while improving, he is going to have a hard time making friends out there on the streets. He has kind of a prickly personality. He will naturally feel more comfortable with young and needy boys. And that is a continued risk factor at this time. [][]... [f]</p>\n<p id=\"b899-6\">\u201cBecause he is having a relationship with these kids, thinking of them as peers or like as if they are on the same level, so that it is\u2014it is not just the physical part. So lack of testosterone will not affect that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b899-7\">Later, Dr. Starr said, \u201cIn his case, he has many of the same personality features and needs and problems that are contributory to his sexual offending: the need for attention, the neediness, the childlike demeanor, the lack of recognition of his internal conflicts and thought processes. All those things need to be controlled, all those things are still there, and those are high risk factors for him.\u201d Similarly, in responding to the prosecutor\u2019s question as to why it was his opinion that it would be necessary for Fields to remain in a secure facility to ensure the health and safety of others, Dr. Owen stated: \u201cWell, we know what happened last time he left custody. Even though he was in treatment, he was committing sexual offenses. [][] Things are different now in the sense he has had the orchiectomy, but he hasn\u2019t completed treatment to address the psychological elements of his sexual offenses. I think it is imperative he do [so]. I think it is imperative he finally face these demons that led to his sexual offending, that he look at his intimacy problems, he look at his high-risk factors, he develops good strategies to deal with all these. I think interrupting his treatment would be reckless and inappropriate. Despite the orchiectomy, I think he does pose a substantial risk of reoffending.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b899-8\">The experts also noted other reasons that Fields\u2019s orchiectomy would not prevent him from reoffending. For example, according to Dr. Starr, a lack of testosterone does not necessarily indicate a lack of sexual desire. When asked whether it was a fair to say that having \u201cless testosterone\u201d would make someone \u201cless likely to be aroused sexually,\u201d Dr. Starr responded, \u201cRight. But women don\u2019t have a high level of testosterone and they manage to be sexually aroused. You see animals that have been castrated; they show sexual behavior. In humans, it is not just a matter of having testosterone, it is a matter of what goes on up here (indicating), what we find sexually attractive, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1022\">*1022</page-number>what arouses us.\u201d Dr. Owen also testified to this effect, explaining: \u201cThere are so many psychological elements. This would be really easy if we believed sex was just based upon testosterone in the testes, and then I would say, \u2018He is good to go. That\u2019s it. The testes are gone. He should be out in the community.\u2019 [J[] But sex is not just a physical experience. It is psychological in so many ways, and there is a lot of research on this. And in this case, I think if we look at his experience with boys, we certainly see this, that first of all many of his sexual accounts did not involve ejaculation on his part. He is orally copulating these boys. He is fondling these boys. There is something sort of arousing just being with boys, having boys in his life, boys as companions, boys as a lover, boys are also sexual objects. So it just isn\u2019t testosterone.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b900-5\">Interestingly, out of a list of 69 risk factors that Fields viewed to be his personal risk factors, only six were \u201csexual in nature,\u201d while \u201call the rest [were] psychological.\u201d Further, Fields\u2019s crimes did not necessarily require that Fields be physically able to have an erection: \u201cMost of the kinds of contacts he has with these children do[] not require an erection. Tying them up doesn\u2019t require an erection, orally copulating them wouldn\u2019t require an erection, or fondling; all of those things do not require [an erection].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b900-6\">The evidence further demonstrated that even an individual who has undergone a physical castration can reverse the effects of the castration by taking testosterone. Dr. Starr noted this during her testimony: \u201cSo [castration] certainly does reduce people\u2019s sex drive and their preoccupations, at least according to the people who have had that. So I would say that is a significant factor that would help reduce his risk. On the other hand, and I do believe Mr. Fields at this point consciously doesn\u2019t believe[] he would, but . . . people can easily get over-the-counter testosterone and boost their testosterone level back if they so chose.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b900-7\">Dr. Owen expressed concern over the ease with which individuals can access testosterone. He explained, \u201cSteroids, particularly testosterone, [are] pretty easy to get out in the community. You can go to a doctor and get a patch or injection that would give you testosterone.\u201d According to Dr. Owen, Fields might have a number of reasons for seeking out testosterone, and \u201cit wouldn\u2019t be real difficult for [Fields] to go to any physician and get a prescription for testosterone,\u201d because \u201cif he were out, there would be no mandatory supervision, no mandatory treatment, nothing that would prevent him from leaving here and going to any kind of walk-in clinic and getting a prescription.\u201d Even Dr. Flavan, who testified for the defense, acknowledged that the testosterone issue was significant in terms of the risk of reoffending after an orchiectomy. When defense counsel asked Dr. Flavan to explain the studies on castration and to discuss the success of castration in terms of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1023\">*1023</page-number>reducing recidivism in sexual offenders, Dr. Flavan said, \u201cWhat this study discusses was that castration was extremely effective; however, there were two reoffenders and they were people who went to their doctor and said, \u2018May I please have some testosterone,\u2019 and the doctors said, \u2018Yes,\u2019 which was not good.\u201d It was thus clear to the jury that the mere fact that a sexual offender has undergone an orchiectomy does not necessarily eliminate all risk of reoffense.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-5\">The jury was also informed that Fields was aware that he could reverse some of the effects of the orchiectomy by taking testosterone. Defense counsel questioned Fields regarding the possibility of \u201creversing\u201d the orchiectomy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b901-6\">\u201cQ. Well, you could reverse the orchiectomy with steroids, can\u2019t you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b901-7\">\u201cA. I can\u2019t really reverse the orchiectomy. You can only reverse the testosterone.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b901-8\">\u201cQ. That would effectively restore your sex drive, wouldn\u2019t it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b901-9\">\u201cA. That\u2019s what they tell me.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b901-10\">Although Fields testified that he would not take testosterone if he were released, the jury was free to reject this testimony, particularly in light of Fields\u2019s failure to be honest about his intentions and his conduct after he was released from prison following his first conviction. Moreover, there was a great deal of evidence about Fields\u2019s various health complaints, the validity of which some of the doctors questioned. The jury could have reasonably inferred that Fields would have a number of opportunities to seek and obtain testosterone if released, and that he might be motivated to do so because of his predilection for engaging in relationships with young boys.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-11\">The speed with which the jury reached its verdict further convinces us that the jury would not have reached a more favorable result for Fields if Fields\u2019s attorney had been permitted to ask the experts about the polygraph examination. After hearing testimony for more than a week, the jury deliberated for less than two hours before finding Fields to be an SVP. The jury did not seem to have any difficulty reaching a decision as to Fields\u2019s dangerousness. Considering the minimal impact this additional evidence might have had relative to all of the other evidence that was presented to the jury, we cannot conclude that there is a reasonable probability that the jury would have reached a different result if it had known more about the results of the polygraph examination that was administered to Fields.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1024\">*1024</page-number>rv.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-5\">DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"AM7\">The judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"Aq7\">Nares, Acting P.
