They maintain that class members were not given adequate notice of the settlement, that the settlement was not fair, reasonable and adequate, and that the court erred in approving attorney fees to class counsel. We conclude the court did not abuse its discretion, and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-10\">Procedural and Factual Background</p>\n<p id=\"b471-11\">This case originated in 1999 as a suit against Bank of America, N.A., and related entities (Bank) by the Utility Consumers\u2019 Action Network (UCAN) acting on behalf of its affiliate, the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse. The case was coordinated with two similar actions against Bank, <em>Slayton v. Bank of America NT&amp; SA, </em>and <em>Asatryan v. Bank of America NT &amp; SA, </em>and assigned to the Honorable Richard Kramer as the coordination trial judge. A consolidated class action complaint was filed on April 30, 2003, pursuant to court order, with named plaintiffs Donovan Collier, Juan Duron, Terry Wolbert, Ki Won Rhee, Do Young Cho and Frank Cho.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-12\">The complaint alleged causes of action for unlawful and fraudulent business practices, false or misleading advertising, invasion of privacy in violation of the common law and the California Constitution, and unjust enrichment. Plaintiffs alleged that Bank, despite representations to the contrary, disclosed personal and confidential information to third party telemarketers and direct mail marketers for a fee, to enable them to market services to plaintiffs. They alleged the confidential information disclosed included account numbers, account balances, credit limits, Social Security numbers and other \u201csensitive\u201d information.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>The parties first attempted settlement in 2004, when they engaged in three mediation sessions with former United States Magistrate Judge Edward Infante. The court tentatively certified a California class on March 9, 2005, but deferred ruling on a nationwide class to allow further discovery. The parties continued settlement negotiations over the years, and finally reached a settlement agreement in early 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-4\">The settlement agreement provided that Bank would provide the following to class members: (1) waiver of deposited item return fees; (2) waiver of fees for telephone calls to its voice response unit; (3) vouchers for a $200 discount on loan fees for class members who take out a new residential first mortgage or refinance an existing residential mortgage; and (4) for class members who had a Bank-branded consumer credit card, either 12 free months of the card registry service, with a retail value of $30 or 90 days of the Privacy Assist identity theft protection service, with a retail value of $17.85. The Bank guaranteed it would continue to provide these benefits to class members until the aggregate benefit reached $10.75 million. The Bank also agreed to provide a \u201cPrivacy Toolkit\u201d; an informational package with instructions on protecting financial privacy, to every class member who requested one. The value of the Privacy Toolkit would not count toward the aggregate benefit of $10.75 million. Additionally, the settlement agreement provided that Bank would pay a total of $3.25 million to a privacy-related <em>cy pres </em>fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">The parties agreed that Bank would not oppose class counsel\u2019s application for an award of attorney fees and expenses to be determined by the court, but not to exceed $4 million. They also agreed that Bank would not oppose the request for an award of $5,000 to each of the six named class representatives, to be paid from \u201cany award of attorneys\u2019 fees and costs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">Following hearings to consider objections, the court entered an order approving the settlement. Pursuant to the parties\u2019 settlement agreement, the court awarded $1.75 million to the \u201cRose Foundation for <em>cy pres </em>distribution to one or more non-profit entities that specialize in privacy-related research,\u201d education, or policy development. The court also awarded a total of $1.5 million to the following entities: Center for Democracy and Technology ($253,000); Samuelson Law, Technology, &amp; Public Policy Clinic, University of California Berkeley School of Law ($300,000); World Privacy Forum ($275,000); American Civil Liberties Union of Northern California ($300,000); Electronic Privacy Information Center ($150,000); and Consumer Action ($222,000).</p>\n<p id=\"b472-7\">The court also certified for the purposes of settlement a \u201cSettlement Class,\u201d as follows: \u201cAny person who, at any time between September 9, 1995 and May 31, 2007, was a U.S. resident and \u2018(1) Had a Bank of America <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>non-business checking or savings account; (2) Was a borrower on a non-business loan issued by (or acquired by) Bank of America secured by residential real estate within the United States; or (3) Had a Bank of America branded consumer credit card and a California mailing address for purposes of communicating with Bank of America. . . .\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">The court entered a judgment of dismissal on October 4, 2007. Following further hearings, and after ordering supplemental submissions by the parties, the court entered a separate order awarding attorney fees and expenses. The court awarded class counsel $2,907,982 in attorney fees (based on a lodestar sum of $1,661,704, with a 1.75 multiplier) and $110,373 in expenses. The fees were awarded alternatively under the common fund doctrine, and under the \u201cprivate attorney general\u201d provisions of Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The court denied $951,450 in claimed attorney fees and $40,000 in claimed costs, finding that certain law firms had failed to meet their burden of proving the amount of fees sought. From the award of attorney fees, the court ordered that $5,000 be paid to each of the six individual class representatives.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">Four objectors in the trial court filed appeals. Michael and Elizabeth Savage filed a timely appeal from the order approving settlement and the judgment of dismissal. Renee Garvin filed a timely appeal from the order approving settlement, the judgment of dismissal, and the order awarding attorney fees and expenses. Elaine Savage filed a timely appeal from the order awarding attorney fees and expenses and the \u201cOrder allowing filing of Order Approving Class Action Settlement Nunc Pro Tunc entered on December 4, 2007.\u201d We consider the three appeals, raising related issues, together, and issue a single opinion.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b474-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b474-4\">A.-D.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">E. <em>The Attorney Fees Award</em></p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">Appellants Renee Garvin (Garvin) and Elaine Savage<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> attack the court\u2019s award of attorney fees to class counsel. We first note that neither Garvin nor Savage challenge the total amount of the fee award in this matter, nor do they contend here that the award was excessive in light of the recovery to the class membership. Rather, they contend that any settlement process that purports, as here, to separately provide for fees is a legal fiction that is pernicious and unethical, and inherently unfair to class members. Garvin also contends that the difference between the amount awarded by the trial court in this instance ($3,018,355 inclusive of expenses) and the maximum amount of $4 million allowed by the settlement agreement was a surplus, which \u201cunder law belonged to th[e class].\u201d We disagree as to both contentions, and will affirm the award.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-7\">The provisions Garvin finds so inherently objectionable are contained in paragraph 7(d) and paragraph 10 of the settlement agreement. They provide that class counsel would seek court approval for payment, by Bank, of not more than $4 million for attorney fees and costs, and that Bank would not oppose such an application. Bank reserved the right to seek to withdraw from the settlement if the court awarded a greater amount, but the settlement was not otherwise contingent on the fee determination. An attorney fee agreement of this type is sometimes referred to as a \u201cclear sailing agreement.\u201d (See <em>Lealao </em>v. <em>Beneficial California, Inc. </em>(2000) 82 Cal.App.4th 19, 32 [97 Cal.Rptr.2d 797] (Lealao); <em>Weinberger v. Great Northern Nekoosa Corp. </em>(1st Cir. 1991) 925 F.2d 518, 520, fn. 1.)</p>\n<p id=\"b474-8\">Garvin claims that the \u201c \u2018separate\u2019 payment scheme is a breach of class counsel\u2019s fiduciary responsibility to the class because it puts class counsel\u2019s interests in maximizing their fee ahead of class counsel\u2019s responsibility to maximize the class\u2019s recovery\u201d and insists that this position \u201chas <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>been enshrined into class action law at both the federal and State of California level.\u201d While it is true that the propriety of \u201cclear sailing\u201d attorney fee agreements has been debated in scholarly circles (see Henderson, <em>Clear Sailing Agreements: A Special Form of Collusion in Class Action Settlements </em>(2003) 77 Tul. L.Rev. 813, 815-816; Herr, Ann. Manual for Complex Litigation (4th ed. 2009) \u00a7\u00a7 21.662, 21.71, pp. 522-524, 533-534), commentators have also noted that class action \u201csettlement agreements] typically include[] a \u2018clear sailing\u2019 clause . . . .\u201d (Alexander, <em>Rethinking Damages in Securities Class Actions </em>(1996) 48 Stan. L.Rev. 1487, 1534.) In fact, commentators have agreed that such an agreement is proper. \u201c[A]n agreement by the defendant to pay such sum of reasonable fees as may be awarded by the court, and agreeing also not to object to a fee award up to a certain sum, is probably still a proper and ethical practice. This practice serves to facilitate settlements and avoids a conflict, and yet it gives the defendant a predictable measure of exposure of total monetary liability for the judgment and fees in a case. To the extent it facilitates completion of settlements, this practice should not be discouraged.\u201d (Newberg on Class Actions (4th ed. 2002) \u00a7 15:34, p. 112, fn. omitted.)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">Garvin acknowledges the absence of any evidence here of misconduct by class counsel, or of any collusion between counsel and defendant Bank in negotiation of the fees. Garvin nevertheless maintains that this court \u201cmust set up a structural mechanism that protects against the dangers of class counsel\u2019s and defendant\u2019s manipulation of the settlement process,\u201d asserting that \u201c[t]his is an issue about procedural temptation and fiduciary responsibility, not about evidence of misconduct in a given settlement negotiation, fit] \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 fill \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 The <em>potential </em>for abuse is the issue.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">Aside from the question of whether this is an argument better addressed to the Legislature, we find no federal or California authority that has adopted Garvin\u2019s argument, and Garvin cites none. Her assertion that the practice has been \u201ccondemned\u201d in the federal Manual for Complex Litigation is simply incorrect. The section cited by Garvin, in context, provides that <em>\u201cIf an agreement is reached on the amount of a settlement fund and a separate </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number><em>amount for attorney fees and expenses, </em>both amounts must be disclosed to the class. Moreover, the sum of the two amounts ordinarily should be treated as a settlement fund for the benefit of the class, with the agreed-on fee amount constituting the upper limit on the fees that can be awarded to counsel. <em>The total fund could be used to measure whether the portion allocated to the class and to attorney fees is reasonable.\u201d </em>(Herr, Ann. Manual for Complex Litigation, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 21.71, p. 525, italics added.)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Far from condemning the practice of separate agreements on fees, the manual acknowledges such provisions, and merely requires that the total settlement amount, including fees, be used as a yardstick to measure the reasonableness of the fees. Similar fee agreements have been implicitly approved in <em>Dunk </em>v. <em>Ford Motor Co. </em>(1996) 48 Cal.App.4th 1794 [56 Cal.Rptr.2d 483] <em>(Dunk) </em>(Defendant agreed to pay attorney fees and costs not to exceed $1.5 million; remanded to trial court only to determine the amount of fees using a lodestar analysis); <em>Lealao, supra, </em>82 Cal.App.4th at page 24 (Defendant agreed to pay \u201creasonable attorney fees as determined by the court\u201d; remanded for consideration of additional factors in determining the amount to be awarded); <em>Ramos v. Countrywide Home Loans, Inc. </em>(2000) 82 Cal.App.4th 615 [98 Cal.Rptr.2d 388] (\u201cfee shifting\u201d agreement for separate fees to be paid by defendant); and <em>Garabedian v. Los Angeles Cellular Telephone Co. </em>(2004) 118 Cal.App.4th 123 [12 Cal.Rptr.3d 737] (Defendant agreed to pay $14,125,000 to the extent approved by the court). (See also <em>Zucker v. Occidental Petroleum Corp. </em>(9th Cir. 1999) 192 F.3d 1323, 1325 [Defendants would not oppose request for fees and reimbursements not to exceed $2,975,000].)<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> It is further difficult to envision how the specter of attorney malfeasance that she invokes would be laid to rest were the prophylactic rule she advocates actually adopted. The Manual for Complex Litigation offers a caveat on negotiation of a lump sum settlement covering both class claims and attorney fees, observing that \u201c[a]lthough there is no bar to such arrangements, the simultaneous negotiation of . . . attorney fees creates a potential conflict.\u201d (Herr, Ann. Manual for Complex Litigation, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 21.71, p. 525, fn. omitted.) If fees were not negotiated simultaneously, but instead were to be subsequently determined by the court as a portion of a lump sum, as Garvin appears to suggest, any argument by counsel to enhance his or her fees from a \u201ccommon fund\u201d beyond a base lodestar amount would of necessity diminish the recovery of the class, again engendering the same conflict of interest she claims occurs here.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>Our courts have always been cognizant of the inherent tension between the interests of class membership and counsel in settlement of class action litigation. \u201c \u2018In any class action there is always the temptation for the attorney for the class to recommend settlement on terms less favorable to his clients because a large fee is part of the bargain.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Apple Computer, Inc. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(2005) 126 Cal.App.4th 1253, 1265 [24 Cal.Rptr.3d 818].) For this reason the majority of courts have found, for example, that it is impermissible to have a class representative too closely associated with the class attorney. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1264, quoting <em>Susman v. Lincoln American Corp. </em>(7th Cir. 1977) 561 F.2d 86, 90-91.) It has also been recognized that once an agreement to settle is reached, the interests of class counsel and a defendant are no longer necessarily adverse. (See <em>In re General Motors Corp. Pick-Up Truck Fuel Tank </em>(3d Cir. 1995) 55 F.3d 768, 819-820 [\u201c \u2018a defendant is interested only in disposing of the total claim asserted against it; ... the allocation between the class payment and the attorneys\u2019 fees is of little or no interest to the defense.\u2019 ...[][]... [T]he divergence in financial incentives [between the class and counsel] creates the \u2018danger . . . that the lawyers might urge a class settlement at a low figure or on a less-than-optimal basis in exchange for red-carpet treatment for fees ....\u2019\u201d (citations omitted)].)</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">Because of the potential for fraud, collusion or unfairness, thorough judicial review of fee applications is required in all class action settlements and the fairness of the fees must be assessed independently of determining the fairness of the substantive settlement terms. <em>(Dunk, supra, </em>48 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1808-1809.) Although presenting no evidence of any abuse here, Garvin nevertheless claims that \u201ctrial court discretion is not an adequate protection against the settling parties\u2019 ability to sacrifice class-member interests to benefit themselves.\u201d Garvin further asserts that \u201c[bjecause of trial courts\u2019 proclivity to approve class action settlements based upon the parties\u2019 representations, this Court cannot rely on individual trial court judges to weed out self-interested behavior by the settling parties.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">We are unwilling to make any such assumptions. Instead, we presume that our trial judges are well aware of their responsibilities as \u201cfiduciaries\u201d for the protection of absent class members <em>(7-Eleven Owners for Fair Franchising v. Southland Corp. </em>(2000) 85 Cal.App.4th 1135, 1151 [102 Cal.Rptr.2d 777]) \u201c \u2018whose rights may not have been given due regard by the negotiating parties\u2019 \u201d <em>(Dunk, supra, </em>48 Cal.App.4th at p. 1801, quoting <em>Officers for Justice </em>v. <em>Civil Service Com\u2019n, etc. </em>(9th Cir. 1982) 688 F.2d 615, 624). The court has a duty, independent of any objection, to assure that the amount and mode of payment of attorney fees are fair and proper, and may not simply act as a rubberstamp for the parties\u2019 agreement. (See <em>Garabedian v. Los Angeles Cellular Telephone Co., supra, </em>118 Cal.App.4th at pp. 128-129.) \u201c \u2018The evil feared in some settlements\u2014unscrupulous attorneys negotiating large attorney\u2019s fees at the expense of an inadequate settlement for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>client\u2014can best be met by a careful . . . judge, sensitive to the problem, properly evaluating the adequacy of the settlement for the class and determining and setting a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee . . . .\u2019 \u201d <em>(Zucker </em>v. <em>Occidental Petroleum Corp., supra, </em>192 F.3d at p. 1328, fn. 20.) Garvin fails to convince us that California trial judges are incapable of performing, or unwilling to perform, these obligations, or that the trial judge here failed to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-4\">We also start from the proposition that the \u201c \u2018experienced trial judge is the best judge of the value of professional services rendered in his court, and while his judgment is of course subject to review, it will not be disturbed unless the appellate court is convinced that it is clearly wrong.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Serrano v. Priest </em>(1977) 20 Cal.3d 25, 49 [141 Cal.Rptr. 315, 569 P.2d 1303]; see <em>Graham </em>v. <em>DaimlerChrysler Corp., supra, </em>34 Cal.4th at p. 579.) For this reason \u201c[o]ur review of the amount of attorney fees awarded is deferential.\u201d <em>(In re Vitamin Cases </em>(2003) 110 Cal.App.4th 1041, 1051-1052 [2 Cal.Rptr.3d 358]; see also <em>PLCM Group, Inc. </em>v. <em>Drexler </em>(2000) 22 Cal.4th 1084, 1095 [95 Cal.Rptr.2d 198, 997 P.2d 511].) We apply an abuse of discretion standard. <em>(Lealao, supra, </em>82 Cal.App.4th at p. 25.) Fees approved by the trial court are presumed to be reasonable, and the objectors must show error in the award. <em>(Dunk, supra, </em>48 Cal.App.4th at p. 1809.)</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">Turning to the fee determination made in this case, we find no error in the award. Garvin makes no specific objection here to the amount of the award, and in fact argued in the trial court that there was no \u201ccommon fund\u201d justifying a percentage recovery, and that a \u201clodestar\u201d approach should be used in calculating fees. Garvin argued below that the supporting evidence for the fee rates and amounts was inadequate. Considering these objections, and expressing its own concern that support was lacking for some claims, the court conducted two subsequent hearings to obtain and review the declarations and documentary support for the requests. The trial court then used a lodestar analysis to determine the base fee, and applied a multiplier to calculate the final award. \u201c \u2018 \u201c[T]he primary method for establishing the amount of \u2018reasonable\u2019 attorney fees is the lodestar method. The lodestar (or touchstone) is produced by multiplying the number of hours reasonably expended by counsel by a reasonable hourly rate. Once the court has fixed the lodestar, it may increase or decrease that amount by applying a positive or negative \u2018multiplier\u2019 to take into account a variety of other factors, including the quality of the representation, the novelty and complexity of the issues, the results obtained, and the contingent risk presented.\u201d [Citation.] \u201cThe purpose of such adjustment is to fix a fee at the fair market value for the particular action. In effect, the court determines, retrospectively, whether the litigation involved a contingent risk or required extraordinary legal skill justifying augmentation of the unadorned lodestar in order to approximate the fair market rate for such services.\u201d [Citation.] Under certain circumstances, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>lodestar calculation may be enhanced on the basis of a percentage-of-the-benefit analysis. [Citation.]\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(In re Vitamin Cases, supra, </em>110 Cal.App.4th at p. 1052.) This approach \u201canchors the trial court\u2019s analysis to an objective determination of the value of the attorney\u2019s services, ensuring that the amount awarded is not arbitrary.\u201d <em>(PLCM Group, Inc. </em>v. <em>Drexler, supra, </em>22 Cal.4th at p. 1095.) \u201c ' \u201cAnchoring the analysis to this concept is the only way of approaching the problem that can claim objectivity, a claim which is obviously vital to the prestige of the bar and the courts.\u201d \u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(In re Vitamin Cases, supra, </em>at p. 1058.)<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The trial court properly used the lodestar approach here, requiring plaintiffs\u2019 law firms to submit detailed support for their fee claims, and denying those claims he found unsupported.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">It may be appropriate in some cases, assuming the class benefit can be monetized with a reasonable degree of certainty, to \u201ccross-check\u201d or adjust the lodestar in comparison to a percentage of the common fund to ensure that the fee awarded is reasonable and within the range of fees freely negotiated in the legal marketplace in comparable litigation.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <em>(Lealao, supra, </em>82 Cal.App.4th at pp. 49-50; see also <em>Wing v. Asarco, Inc. </em>(9th Cir. 1997) 114 F.3d 986, 990.) While the court has discretion to do so where appropriate, it is not required. <em>(Lealao, </em>at pp. 49-50; <em>Ramos v. Countrywide Home Loans, Inc., supra, </em>82 Cal.App.4th at p. 628.) Further, a fee award may not be justified solely as a percentage of the recovery when that award will not come from the settlement fund. <em>(In re Vitamin Cases, supra, </em>110 Cal.App.4th at p. 1060.) Regardless of whether attorney fees are determined using the lodestar method or awarded based on a \u201cpercentage-of-the-benefit\u201d analysis under the common fund doctrine, \u201c \u2018[t]he ultimate goal... is the award of a \u201creasonable\u201d fee to compensate counsel for their efforts, irrespective of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>method of calculation.\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Apple Computer, Inc. v. Superior Court, supra, </em>126 Cal.App.4th at p. 1270.) It is not an abuse of discretion to choose one method over another as long as the method chosen is applied consistently using percentage figures that accurately reflect the marketplace. <em>(Chavez v. Netflix, Inc., supra, </em>162 Cal.App.4th at pp. 65-66.)</p>\n<p id=\"b480-4\">As Justice Kline observed in <em>Lealao, </em>what constitutes a reasonable fee in a representative action is a complex question to which there are no easy answers. <em>(Lealao, supra, </em>82 Cal.App.4th at p. 53.) The methodology used by the trial court was consistent with applicable law, and no abuse of discretion is shown.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">F. <em>The Claimed \u201cSurplus\u201d from the Fee Award</em></p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">Despite Garvin\u2019s assertion in the trial court that there was no \u201ccommon fund\u201d on which to base attorney fees, she nevertheless argues here that the attorney fees were a component of the class recovery, and that the difference between the fees and costs actually awarded ($3,018,355) and the maximum amount that Bank agreed to pay ($4 million) constitutes a \u201csurplus\u201d belonging to the class members. She contends that \u201c[t]he class had a right to what Defendant made available to settle the litigation\u201d and that therefore there is a sum of $981,645 due the class. (Emphasis omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b480-7\">She claims here, as she did in the trial court, that the Manual for Complex Litigation supports this rather unique theory. It does not. As discussed above, Garvin\u2019s citation from the manual that \u201cthe sum of the two amounts [class settlement and fees] ordinarily should be treated as a settlement fund for the benefit of the class\u201d (Herr, Ann. Manual for Complex Litigation, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 21.71, p. 525) is taken out of context and does not stand for the proposition she urges. As previously noted, the manual goes on to explain that the two amounts are treated as a \u201csettlement fund\u201d so that the \u201ctotal fund could be used to measure whether the portion allocated to the class and to attorney fees is reasonable.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>As the trial court also observed, nothing in the Manual for Complex Litigation suggests that any reduction in the claimed attorney fees be awarded to the class. \u201cThe citation of the Complex Litigation Manual does not establish otherwise. [][]... [f] .. . It doesn\u2019t say what you say it says, period. It does not allow the Court to restructure the deal of the parties, so I\u2019m not disregarding a thing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b480-8\">Garvin\u2019s reliance on <em>Staton v. Boeing Co. </em>(9th Cir. 2003) 327 F.3d 938, is similarly misplaced. In <em>Staton, </em>an employment discrimination class action, the parties negotiated the amount of attorney fees as part of the settlement between the class and the defendant, and included as a term of the proposed decree the specific amount of attorney fees that class counsel would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>receive. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 944\u2014945.) Rejecting that approach, the court held that in a case which involved both a statutory fee-shifting provision and an actual or putative common fund it would be permissible to <em>either </em>negotiate and settle the amount of statutory fees along with the merits of the case (with judicial approval of fees consistent with the reasonableness standard), or alternatively to negotiate and agree to the value of a common fund (including an estimated hypothetical award of statutory fees) and then apply to the court for an award from the fund, using common fund fee principles. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 972.) In the latter circumstance, where there is a single \u201ccommon fund,\u201d after the court determines the fee amount \u201call the remaining value of the fund belongs to the class rather than reverting to the defendant.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>That is not the situation presented here. Even those cases that have treated fees as part of a \u201cconstructive common fund\u201d or a \u201cpackage deal\u201d have done so only for purposes of assessing the total value of a settlement, and to compare the allocation of benefits between counsel and the class. (See <em>In re General Motors Corp. Pick-Up Truck Fuel Tank, supra, </em>55 F.3d at p. 820; <em>Apple Computer, Inc. v. Superior Court, supra, </em>126 Cal.App.4th at p. 1269.) Simply put, there is a complete absence of any authority supporting Garvin\u2019s position.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">Garvin\u2019s arguments that this creates a \u201cwindfall\u201d for a defendant, and a disincentive for class members to raise objections to the fee again miss the mark. Under the terms of the agreement before us, defendant merely established the outer limits of its liability for fees, and agreed not to oppose a fee application within the defined range, without conceding the propriety of any particular amount. A court must still determine the reasonableness of the fee, and must do so whether or not there is an objection presented from the class. <em>(Garabedian </em>v. <em>Los Angeles Cellular Telephone Co., supra, </em>118 Cal.App.4th at p. 129.) For the reasons previously stated, we likewise reject Garvin\u2019s allegation that there is a \u201cjudicial predisposition to go along with the parties\u2019 \u2018deal\u2019 \u201d and that the fee structure here is part of a strategy by the plaintiff\u2019s class action bar to \u201cdisincentivize judicial scrutiny of their fee request.\u201d As Garvin admits, the court here did reduce the fee request, and we do not presume that any other trial judge would take the cavalier and dismissive approach to this serious task that Garvin suggests.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">G. <em>Objectors\u2019 Claim for Attorney Fees and Costs on Appeal</em></p>\n<p id=\"b481-7\">Garvin seeks attorney fees and costs on appeal, claiming that a \u201cclass member/obj ector who has benefited his or her class [or the class action mechanism generally] is entitled to an award of reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees and costs.\u201d \u201c[T]here is no direct authority in California applying the substantial benefit doctrine to award attorney fees to an objector . . . [though] a number of federal courts have endorsed use of the doctrine to award attorney fees to an objector whose actions substantially benefit class members. . . . [f] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>The leitmotiv of all these opinions is that the objector must establish his or her efforts produced a concrete benefit for the class, allowing it to recover more (or otherwise be in an improved position) than it would have in the absence of the objector\u2019s efforts.\u201d <em>(Consumer Cause, Inc. v. Mrs. Gooch\u2019s Natural Food Markets </em>(2005) 127 Cal.App.4th 387, 397-398, citations omitted [25 Cal.Rptr.3d 514].) Garvin has made no showing of benefit to the class in pursuing this appeal, and we therefore deny the request.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-4\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">Jones, P.

The letter, which was not presented to the trial court, was authored by a number of academics and resulted primarily from objections to surreptitious separate fee arrangements in tobacco litigation undisclosed to class members.
