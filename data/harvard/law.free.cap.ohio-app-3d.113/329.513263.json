In its assignment of error, appellant challenges the trial court\u2019s failure to permit its claim for declaratory relief challenging the constitutionality of the ordinances to be submitted to a jury.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The assignment is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-14\">We first question whether there exists a question of fact. The \u201cfactual\u201d issues that appellant claims need to be resolved, <em>i.e., </em>the number of sewerage systems and whether the spirit of a statute<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> is violated, appear to involve the construction and interpretation of the applicable ordinances and statutes. Statutory construction and interpretation are issues for legal resolution. Even if we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>assume, however, that these are factual issues, the trial court did not err in not allowing appellant a jury trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">R.C. 2721.10, which provides for a jury trial in a declaratory judgment action, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-6\">\u201cWhen a proceeding under sections 2721.01 to 2721.15, inclusive, of the Revised Code, involves the determination of an issue of fact, such issue may be tried and determined in the same manner as issues of fact are tried and determined in other civil actions in the court in which the proceeding is pending.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b367-7\">The right to a jury trial in civil actions is set forth by R.C. 2311.04, which provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b367-8\">\u201cIssues of law must be tried by the court, unless referred as provided in the Rules of Civil Procedure. Issues of fact arising in actions for the recovery of money only, or specific real or personal property, shall be tried by a jury, unless a jury trial is waived, or unless all parties consent to a reference under the Rules of Civil Procedure.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-9\">\u201cAll other issues of fact shall be tried by the court, subject to its power to order any issue to be tried by a jury, or referred.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b367-10\">Because appellant\u2019s demand for a declaration as to the constitutionality of the city\u2019s ordinances did not seek money, specific realty or personal property, it was not entitled to a jury trial on that issue. See <em>Erie Ins. Group v. Fisher </em>(1984), 15 Ohio St.3d 380, 15 OBR 497, 474 N.E.2d 320; <em>Clark v. Woodmere </em>(1985), 28 Ohio App.3d 66, 28 OBR 107, 502 N.E.2d 222; <em>Mentor v. Nozik </em>(Sept. 23, 1994), Lake App. No. 93-L-130, unreported, 1994 WL 613779. Therefore, appellant\u2019s assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-11\">Accordingly, the judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-12\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b367-13\">Doan, P.J., and Sundermann, J., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b366-15\">. Appellant\u2019s request for declaratory judgment was presented in its counterclaim against the city.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b366-16\">. Presumably, the statute referred to is R.C. 729.45 or 729.52.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
