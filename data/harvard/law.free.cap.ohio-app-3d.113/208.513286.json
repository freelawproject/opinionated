After a jury trial, he was found guilty as indicted. McGhee now appeals his conviction. For the reasons that follow, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-10\">The state introduced the following evidence at trial. On January 9, 1995, McGhee asked a friend, Tawana Richardson, to open up an account at a local bank in her name. McGhee told her that he could not open the account himself because he did not have the proper identification. As a result, Richardson opened a savings account at First National Bank in Akron with $50 McGhee had given her. After opening the account, Richardson gave McGhee \u201cthe whole package\u201d she had received from the bank, including an ATM card.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-11\">On January 12,1995, McGhee presented Richardson with a $4,700 check drawn on Kerry Santana\u2019s account and made payable to Richardson. McGhee told Richardson that he received the check as payment for some furniture he had sold to Santana. Richardson deposited the check into the account at First National Bank. Over the next several days, McGhee withdrew over $1,000 from the Richardson account using several ATMs. On January 17, 1995, Richardson withdrew $3,700 from the savings account at McGhee\u2019s request. Richardson gave the $3,700 to McGhee and in return, McGhee gave her $100 for \u201chelping him out.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b245-12\">On January 18, 1995, the $4,700 check that had been deposited into the Richardson account was returned to First National Bank marked \u201caccount closed.\u201d Because the returned check was so large and money had been withdrawn from the Richardson account, the bank conducted an investigation. The bank investigators questioned Richardson and learned that McGhee was involved. McGhee, however, refused to cooperate with the bank investigators, and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>matter was referred to the Akron Police Department. During the course of their investigation, the police discovered that Santana had not been involved in the check fraud scheme and ruled him out as a suspect. McGhee was eventually charged with theft in violation of R.C. 2913.02(A)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">At the conclusion of the state\u2019s case, McGhee moved for acquittal pursuant to Crim.R. 29. The trial court, however, denied the motion. The defense then presented only one witness, McGhee himself. McGhee denied asking Richardson to open the savings account for him and claimed he knew nothing about the $4,700 check. McGhee admitted to making several ATM withdrawals from the Richardson account, but claimed he had her permission to use the card.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">Based on the evidence produced at trial, McGhee was found guilty as indicted. McGhee now appeals his conviction, raising two assignments of error for our review:</p>\n<p id=\"b246-7\">\u201cI. The trial court erred in overruling appellant\u2019s Rule 29 motion for acquittal where the state of Ohio failed to prove each element of a violation of R.C. 2913.02(A)(1) beyond a reasonable doubt, thereby violating appellant\u2019s right to due process of law under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article I, Section 16 of the Ohio Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-8\">\u201cII. The jury verdict finding appellant guilty of theft was against the manifest weight of the evidence in violation of appellant\u2019s right to due process of law under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article I, Section 16 of the Ohio Constitution.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b246-9\">McGhee first argues the state failed to prove all the elements of the crime charged in the indictment and, therefore, the trial court should have granted his motion for acquittal pursuant to Crim.R. 29. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-10\">Crim.R. 29 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-11\">\u201cThe court on motion of a defendant or on its own motion, after the evidence on either side is closed, shall order the entry of a judgment of acquittal of one or more offenses charged in the indictment, information, or complaint, if the evidence is insufficient to sustain a conviction of such offense or offenses. * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b246-12\">In reviewing the appropriateness of such a motion, \u201ca court shall not order an entry of judgment of acquittal if the evidence is such that reasonable minds can reach different conclusions as to whether each material element of a crime has been proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>State v. Bridgeman </em>(1978), 55 Ohio St.2d 261, 9 O.O.3d 401, 381 N.E.2d 184, syllabus. In the present case, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>evidence presented at trial was insufficient to sustain McGhee\u2019s conviction for the offense presented in the indictment, <em>i.e., </em>theft in violation of R.C. 2913.02(A)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">The theft statute, R.C. 2913.02, provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">\u201c(A) No person, with purpose to deprive the owner of property or services, shall knowingly obtain or exert control over either the property or services in any of the following ways:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-7\">\u201c(1) Without the consent of the owner or person authorized to give consent;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-8\">\u201c(2) Beyond the scope of the express or implied consent of the owner or person authorized to give consent;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-9\">\u201c(3) By deception;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-10\">\u201c(4) By threat.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b247-11\">Here, the state failed to establish, beyond a reasonable doubt, the essential elements necessary to uphold McGhee\u2019s conviction for theft. There was no evidence that McGhee deprived the victim, First National Bank, of its property without its consent. The bank clearly allowed Richardson and McGhee to make numerous withdrawals from the Richardson account before the $4,700 check had cleared. While the evidence may have established that McGhee violated R.C. 2913.02(A)(3) (theft by deception), our decision must be based upon the offense for which McGhee was indicted, tried, and convicted. McGhee obtained or exerted control over the bank\u2019s property with the bank\u2019s consent. He was indicted incorrectly.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-12\">Because the evidence was insufficient to support McGhee\u2019s conviction for theft under R.C. 2913.02(A)(1), the trial court erred in failing to grant McGhee\u2019s motion for acquittal. Accordingly, McGhee\u2019s first assignment of error is well taken, and his conviction must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-13\">Given our treatment of McGhee\u2019s first assignment of error, we find that McGhee\u2019s second assignment of error is moot and is therefore overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-14\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b247-15\">Edward J.

On January 9, 1995, McGhee asked Richardson to open a bank' account at the First National Bank of Ohio (\u201cBank\u201d). Richardson did so in her name with $50 provided by McGhee. In compliance with McGhee\u2019s specific request, Richardson provided him with the ATM card. Three days later, McGhee gave Richardson a signed check apparently from the checking account of Santana, allegedly as payment for furniture McGhee had sold to Santana. Santana testified that he did not know McGhee or Richardson, and that he had closed the account and thought he had disposed of all of the checks. On January 18, 1995, the drawee bank returned the check, unpaid, to Bank with the notation \u201caccount closed.\u201d Richardson also testified that McGhee had asked her on a later date to deposit a different check into a Star Bank account, but that the Star Bank would not accept the check because it was drawn on an account that had no funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">On January 17, 1995, Richardson withdrew $3,700 from her Bank account and gave the money to McGhee. From January 12 through January 18, McGhee made numerous ATM withdrawals from Richardson\u2019s Bank account. During the police investigation, McGhee initially denied knowing Richardson and ever having been to Bank. He later recanted, explaining that he was withdrawing the money on Richardson\u2019s behalf. Still later, he stated to investigators that Richardson solicited him to open the account. At trial, McGhee testified that he received only $10 from Richardson for gas money.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">To rephrase R.C. 2913.02(A)(1), McGhee was convicted of knowingly obtaining or exerting control over Bank\u2019s property without Bank\u2019s consent, with the purpose of depriving Bank of the property. The majority characterizes McGhee\u2019s withdrawals as his exerting of control over Bank\u2019s property with Bank\u2019s consent. There is authority to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-8\">Where an employer originates a \u201csting\u201d to test the honesty of its own security guards by staging a series of mock thefts, and the security guards cooperate with the purported theft, the employer has consented to the removal of its property, and the security guards cannot be convicted of theft, in violation of R.C. 2913.02(A)(1). <em>State v. Mehozonek </em>(1983), 8 Ohio App.3d 271, 8 OBR 364, 456 N.E.2d 1353. However, \u201c \u2018 \u201c[i]f the criminal design originates with the accused, and the owner or his agent or servant does not suggest the design or actively urge the commission of the crime, the mere fact that the owner, suspecting the accused, * * * exposes the property, neglects to protect it, or furnishes facilities for the execution of the criminal design, under the expectation that the accused will take the property or avail himself of the facilities furnished, will not amount <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>in law to a consent[.]\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 275, 8 OBR at 368, 456 N.E.2d at 1357, quoting <em>Averitt v. State </em>(1963), 246 Miss. 49, 58-59, 149 So.2d 320, 324-325.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">There is ample evidence in the record that McGhee originated his criminal designs before the \u201cSantana\u201d check was deposited. Had Bank been aware <em>ex ante </em>of McGhee\u2019s plans to deposit a bogus check and withdraw the proceeds, Bank would not be held to have consented. Bank\u2019s ignorance of McGhee\u2019s scheme cannot transform its conduct into \u201cconsent\u201d and so excuse a defendant convicted under R.C. 2913.02(A)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">Nor does Bank\u2019s mistake in failing to hold the check amount until payment from the drawee bank arise to consent to defendant\u2019s control. In <em>State v. Montes </em>(1993), 92 Ohio App.3d 539, 636 N.E.2d 378, the city of Cleveland was held not to have consented to appellant\u2019s unlawful taking of a car the city mistakenly released to him. By the failure of its check-holding system, Bank no more consents to theft than it would to armed robbery by hiring sleepy security guards. In <em>Montes, </em>the court insisted that where a victim mistakenly releases property, the focus of inquiry under the consent element of R.C. 2913.02(A)(1) is upon the defendant\u2019s lack of lawful possession. <em>Id. </em>at 553, 636 N.E.2d at 386-387, citing <em>State v. Rhodes </em>(1982), 2 Ohio St.3d 74, 76, 2 OBR 629, 631, 442 N.E.2d 1299, 1301-1302. In contrast to the majority\u2019s reasoning in the case <em>sub judice, </em>the court\u2019s reasoning in <em>Montes </em>corresponds to the common-law roots of the Ohio theft statute.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b249-7\">For these reasons, I dissent from the majority decision. I believe that McGhee\u2019s first assignment of error should be rejected, and the judgment of the trial court should be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b249-8\">. It was well settled at common law that the recipient of a mistaken delivery who appropriates the property commits a trespass in the taking, and so is guilty of larceny, if, realizing the mistake at die moment he makes delivery, he forms the intent to steal the property. LaFave &amp; Scott, Criminal Law (1986) 713, Section 8.2. R.C. 2913.02 was intended to cover a plethora of former offenses \"of which the gist was larceny, embezzlement, conversion, fraud, or false pretense[s].\u201d R.C. 2913.02, Committee Comment to H.B. No. 511. On the consolidation of common-law crimes in theft statutes, see LaFave &amp; Scott, at 759, Section 8.8.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
