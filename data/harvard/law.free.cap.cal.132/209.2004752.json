State, </em>135 Ind. 54; <em>Coy v. Indianapolis Gas Co., </em>.146 Ind. 655.) The offer to supply gas upon conditions was a waiver of the sufficiency of the demand. (Civ.

Ency. of Law, 528; <em>Shepard </em>v. <em>Milwaukee Gaslight Co., </em>6 Wis. 526-539; <em>Shepard </em>v. <em>Milwaukee Gaslight Co., </em>11 Wis. 234; <em>Shepard </em>v. <em>Milwaukee Gaslight Co., </em>15 Wis. 318;<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Rochester Gas Light Co., </em>7 App. Div.

It being the uniform custom of the gas company to furnish meters without rent, it was its duty to furnish a meter to plaintiff without rent. <em>(Louisville Gas Co. </em>v. <em>Dulaney, </em>100 Ky. 405; <em>Spring Valley Water Works </em>v. <em>San Francisco, </em>82 Cal. 286;<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Red Star etc. Co. </em>v. <em>Jersey City, </em>45 N.

The judgment was for the defendant, and the plaintiff appeals. The provision of -the code in question is, that, \u201cupon the application, in writing, of the owner or occupant of any building or premises distant not more than one hundred feet from any main of the corporation, . . . the corporation must supply gas as required for such building or premises,\u201d etc.; and further, that \u201cif, for the space of ten days after such application, the corporation refuses or neglects to supply the gas required, it must pay to the applicant the sum of fifty dollars as liquidated damages, and five dollars a day as liquidated damages for every day such refusal or neglect continues thereafter.\u201d The case as presented by the findings is as follows: \u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b249-7\">The defendant is a corporation engaged in supplying the city of Sacramento with gas, and the plaintiff is an occupant of premises within a hundred feet of one of its mains. September 22,1898, the plaintiff served on the.defendant a written <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>notice, which (omitting date, address, and signature) was as follows: \u201cYqu will please immediately supply me with gas for the premises occupied by me,\u201d etc. (describing them). The defendant, in reply, within ten days thereafter, \u201c notified plaintiff that it would supply plaintiff with gas for said building and premises, if plaintiff would furnish a meter, or agree to pay defendant fifty cents per month as rent for a meter,\u201d and \u201c plain; tiff refused to furnish a meter, or to pay said rent to the defendant.\u201d The rent demanded was found by the court to be \u201c fair and equitable,\u201d representing the monthly cost of the meter to the 'defendant, for care, labor, interest on investment, etc. But it is found that the defendant had no rule requiring payment of rent for meters, nor did it charge its other customers therefor. The defendant, it seems, had, prior to September 8, 1898, been supplying plaintiff with gas; but the plaintiff, during the year preceding that date, had used electrical lights mainly and almost \u25a0 exclusively, and the total amount of gas used on the premises amounted only to the value of $1.75; and the defendant, on that date, had removed the meter, thereby depriving the plaintiff of gas. It is found\u2014in a passage following the statement of the above facts, and the written notice\u2014that \u201csaid gas\u201d was and is necessary for the plaintiff\u2019s us\u00e9 on the premises in question. But\u2014unless this ' expression' be construed as referring to the gas used prior to September 8; 1898\u2014it does not appear how much or what gas was needed.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">There can be no doubt, I think, of the \"right of gas companies, ordinarily, to charge rent for meters. (Civ. Code, sec. 632; <em>Sheward </em>v. <em>Citizens\u2019 Water Co., </em>90 Cal. 641.). But the point is made by the appellant, that, in charging him with such rent, when other consumers were not required to pay it, \u201cthe defendant arbitrarily discriminated against the plaintiff.\u201d But I do not think this is the case. Ordinarily, compensation for the meter is received from the return for the gas consumed. But here, the value of the gas consumed during the year preceding the removal of the meter was not equal to a sixth part of the annual expense of the meter. The plaintiff\u2019s written demand, did not specify, even in a general way, the amount of gas required, or even that he required more gas than he had been in the habit of using <em>(Andrews </em>v. <em>North River etc. Co., </em>51 N. Y. Supp. 872); and the defendant was quite justified in supposing that he required no more. (Code Civ. Proc., sec. 1963; 1 Greenleaf on Evidence, sec. 41.) A \u201c state of mind once <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>proved to exis.t [is] presumed -to remain such, until the contrary appears.\u201d (1 Greenleaf on Evidence', sec. 42.) The case, therefore, stands as though, the plaintiff\u2019s demand had been simply for the restoration of the <em>status </em>quo,\u2014i. e., for the use of the quantity of gas he had been using. The plaintiff\u2019s case was therefore altogether exceptional, and, we may assume, unique. For there is neither finding nor allegation that there were any others in the same category; and if none, then there was no discrimination; and if there were any such, it devolved on the plaintiff to allege and to prove it; for to render one liable for a penalty, every material fact necessary to bring the case within the statute must be affirmatively shown. <em>(Conly </em>v. <em>Clay, </em>90 Hun, 20; <em>Village of Hardwick </em>v. <em>Vermont T. and T. Co., </em>70 Vt. 180; 40 Atl. Rep. 169.) The defendant was justified, then, in notifying the plaintiff that he would be charged with rent for the meter, if supplied by the company; and the plaintiff\u2019s refusal to agree to this, was its sufficient justification in refusing to furnish gas.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-4\">I advise that the judgment be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">Gray, C., and Cooper, C., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">For the reasons given in the foregoing opinion the judgment is affirmed.
