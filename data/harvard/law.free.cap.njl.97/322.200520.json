The defendant, George Dent, on March 11th, 1918, while working for the prosecutor, was injured by the bursting of a siphon containing picric acid, resulting in a facial disfigurement of black scars, keloids or claws, and the complete destruction of the sight of the left eye, which before the accident was almost gone, but usesful in making out outlines close at hand. The case was originally tried before the workmen\u2019s compensation bureau; from that determination the prosecutor appealed to the Court of Common Pleas of Essex county. The workmen\u2019s compensation bureau awarded compensation for an injury partial in character and perma.nent in quality, equivalent to fifteen per cent, of total disability or sixty weeks, at $10 per week, equal to $600 and $65 attorney\u2019s fees and costs of the proceedings.</p>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b368-8\">\u201cThe Essex County Court of Common Pleas awarded compensation for an injury partial in character and permanent in quality, equivalent to twenty per cent, of total disability, or eighty weeks, at $10 per week, equal to $800 \u2014 a counsel fee of $215 and costs of $24.89.</p>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b368-9\">\u201cThe prosecutor contends1 that the award should be for ten weeks\u2019 compensation for the ten per cent, loss of the use of the eye affected by the accident and nothing should be allowed for the, disfigurement caused by the spattering of the acid on the head and face&gt;of the defendant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b368-10\">\u201cThe seven reasons set down by the prosecutor for the reversal of the judgment entered in the Court of Common <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>Pleas seem to cover only this point, <em>i. e., </em>error in the court\u2019s finding, that there was a decreased salability of the defendant\u2019s labor; however, all the reasons are argued in the prosecutor\u2019s brief under one head, viz., there was no legal proof that there has been any decrease in the salability of defendant\u2019s labor. It would serve no useful purpose to recite the facts as shown in the record. It is sufficient for us to say that the findings of the Common Pleas Court of Essex county are amply supported by the facts; that we are satisfied with the judgment entered in that court as a correct application of the statute to the facts.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b369-5\">\u2018\u2018Finding no error in the record, the judgment entered in the Essex County Court of Common Pleas is affirmed, with costs.\u201d</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b369-6\">Por the appellant, <em>Kalisch &amp; Kalisch.</em></attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b369-7\">For the respondent, <em>John Y.
