The trial resulted in a verdict in favor of the plaintiff. The defendant thereupon applied for - and obtained from the Circuit Court a rule requiring the plaintiff to show cause, on a day specified, why the verdict of the jury should not be set aside and for nothing holden. The rule further provided that the allowance thereof should not prejudice the right of the defendant to take an appeal to the Supreme Court in case he should abandon the rule to show cause for a new-trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-8\">Assuming that the reservation contained in the rule was a proper one (a matter which wre do not now decide), it left two courses open to the\u2019 defendant, viz., either to abandon his rule to show cause and take an appeal, or abandon his reserved right to appeal and prosecute the rule to a final decision. The case shoivs that he saiv fit to adopt the latter course \u2014 that is, that the rule to show cause w-as brought to a hearing upon the return day, a.nd that after a consideration of the matters .urged by him in support of the' rule the trial court reached the conclusion that the verdict ought not to he disturbed and discharged: the rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-9\">Rule 129 of the Supreme Court, which wras section 214 of our revised Practice act of 1903, and which was subsequently made a rule of court by the new Practice act of 1912 (statutory rule No. 83, p. 399) provides that the \"granting to a party a rule to show cause why a newr trial shall not he granted, shall be a bar against him to taking or prosecuting an appeal except on points expressly reserved in said rule,\u201d and this standing rule of the court is made applicable to the several Circuit Courts as well as to the Supreme Court. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number><em>Finley </em>v. <em>Handley, </em>50 <em>N.
