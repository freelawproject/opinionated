GILLEN, APPELLANT, v. PUBLIC SERVICE RAILWAY COMPANY, RESPONDENT.</parties>\n<otherdate data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b379-5\">Submitted December 5, 1921</otherdate>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"A_yB\">Decided March 6, 1922.</decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b379-6\">On appeal from the Supreme Court, in which the following <em>per curiam </em>was filed:</p>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b379-7\">\u201cThe legal question presented by the facts of this case is whether the defendant, a street railway company, under the statute, could lawfully raise its fares at any time it chose, without an order of the public utility commission and a delay of twenty days before proceeding under the order.</p>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b379-8\">\u201cThis question was definitely settled in <em>O'Brien </em>v. <em>Public Utility </em>Board, 92 <em>N. J. L. </em>44; affirmed&gt; <em>Id. </em>587, where it was held that the railway company possessed such a right, and that case is controlling here.</p>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b379-9\">\u201cIt was made clear in the ease referred to that the raising of the rates was, as a matter of course, subject to intervention by the public utility board who may suspend the fares. The proposition is self-demonstrating that if the defendant company had the right to raise the fare it needed no order and no twenty days\u2019 delay before putting the order into effect.</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b379-10\">\u201cThe judgment of the District Court is affirmed, with costs.\u201d</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b379-11\">For the appellant, <em>Jerome T.

IVe desire to say in passing that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision is strengthened by the opinion of this court in <em>Hackensack Water Co. </em>v. <em>Board of Public Utility Commissioners, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>96 <em>N. J. L. </em>184, which was decided after the filing of the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion, and was therefore not before the judges at the time of their decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\"><em>For affirmance </em>\u2014 The Chancellor, Chief Justice, Tren chard, Parker, Bergen, Minturn, Black, Katzen-BACH, \u00dcEPPENHEIMER, WILLIAMS, GARDNER, AcKERSON, JJ. 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-8\"><em>For reversal </em>\u2014 White, Van Buskirk, JJ. 2.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
