He liases his claim upon the statute entitled \u201cAn act relating to the salaries of the guards and keepers of the jails, penitentiaries and workhouses of counties of the first class.\u201d <em>Pamph. L. </em>1920, <em>p. </em>333. The first section of the act reads as follows: \u201cThe salaries of male guards and keepers of jails, penitentiaries and workhouses of counties of the first class shall be as follows.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b121-10\">This rule should be discharged for the following reasons: First, it appears from the testimony taken that the county has no money appropriated to pay such salaries; second, the writ should not be directed to the county but to the disbursing officer; third, the act is unconstitutional, in that its title relates to salaries of all guards and keepers of jails, penitentiaries and workhouses, which would include both male and female guards, while the body of the act limits the salaries to male guards, which, is clearly not within the title; fourth, the act is special in limiting the salaries to a class of guards, and does not include all.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-11\">The rule to show cause will be discharged, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
