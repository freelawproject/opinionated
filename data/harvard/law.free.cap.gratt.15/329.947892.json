This is an avoiding of the first contract.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b357-14\">!!. In this state a party out of possession may sell and convey his interest in land; and therefore, though the first purchaser from the infant has been put in possession of the land, and has received a conveyance, the infant on coming of age, may convey, and his deed will avoid the first deed.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b357-15\">4. The effect of the disaffirmance of the first contract of the infant, by his sale after coming of age, is to render the first contract void; to extinguish any interest in law or equity which the first purchaser may have acquired under it; and to entitle the vendor or the second purchaser in his name to recover possession of the land at law; and hold it free from any equity of the first purchaser.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b357-17\">5.

But in a contract executory on his, part, if he has during infancy wasted, sold or otherwise ceased to possess the consideration, and has none of it in his hand in kind on his arrival at age, he is not liable therefor; and may recover the property sold by him without accounting for the consideration received.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b357-22\">8. The purchaser from the infant, with knowledge of the sale made by him of the land after he came of age, obtains from him a deed for it. He can derive no benefit from the deed; but holds the legal title acquired under it in trust for the second purchaser; and may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>be compelled by a court of equity to convey said title to such second purchaser; or if he dies, to his heirs.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b358-12\">9.

Any claim which the purchaser from the infant may have on account of payments made under his contract, or to obtain the deed, is a personal claim against his vendor, and cannot be enforced in a suit brought by the second purchaser to recover the land; he has no interest in or to the laud or the purchase money due from the second purchaser.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b358-15\">11.

Three hundred dollars of the purchase money were paid, according to the contract, in a house and lot in Mechanicsburg. No other payment was made during the infancy of the vendor, except about forty dollars, the amount of\" a debt assumed for him by the vendee. For the balance of the purchase money, the vendee executed' his bond, but it does not appear when it was made payable; though it was, probably, when the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>deed should be executed <em>by </em>the vendor, on or after his arrival at lawful age. It does not appear that any deed, or even title bond, was ever executed to Nisewander for the house and lot in Mechanicsburg. It seems that that property was worth about three hundred dollars, and that he might have sold it for that sum if he had been of age, or could have given security to make a good title when he became of age. But not being able to do so, and being in want of money, he offered to sell it for one hundred dollars; and among others, offered to sell it to the appellant Mustard at that price. The appellant said he did not want it, but that his son Hugh would buy it. And Nisewander did sell it to Hugh Mustard and Addison Harman for about one hundred dollars; which was accordingly paid. The same property was afterwards sold by the appellant to another person for three hundred dollars, paid partly in cash and the balance in trade. Nisewander having become dissatisfied with his sale to the appellant, determined, and often declared, that he would not, on his arrival at age, confirm the sale and make a deed according to his title bond; and these declarations were sometimes made in presence of one or two of the appellant\u2019s sons, but not of the appellant himself. After his arrival at age, he persisted in this determination, and so declared; and on the 8th day of November 1853 he contracted to sell his interest in the land to Samuel Wohlford for eight hundred dollars; of wdiich one hundred dollars was paid in cash, and for the balance three bonds were executed, payable at future periods; and he executed a title bond, conditioned to make a deed before the last payment should become due. When Nisewander applied to Wohlford to make this purchase, the latter knew that the former had contracted during infancy to sell his interest to the appellant, and asked him if he did not intend to comply with his said contract: and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>the former replied that he did not; whereupon the latter made the purchase, and received the title bond aforesaid. A few days after this purchase the appellant endeavored to obtain from Nisewander indemnity for the money paid on their contract as aforesaid; and, failing in that, endeavored to induce Wohlford to agree to rescind his contract with Nisewander, upon the return of the money and bonds received by the latter; but Wohlford refused to do so. Shortly thereafter, to wit, on the 18th of November 1853, the appellant induced Nisewander to execute a deed conveying the land to him in consideration of the sum of nine hundred dollars, being one hundred dollars more than the amount of the purchase money before agreed upon between them; which sum of one hundred dollars was paid at the time of the execution of the deed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b360-11\">Very soon after the execution of the said deed, and during the same month of November 1853, Wohlford instituted this suit for the purpose of having the deed annulled as having been fraudulently obtained by the appellant with a full knowledge of the equitable rights of Wohlford, and of obtaining the legal title to the said interest, and a partition of the land and an allotment of his several portion thereof.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b360-12\">The appellant in his answer admits that he obtained the deed with full notice of the prior sale and title bond to Wohlford, but says, in substance, that he had long previously purchased the same property, and received a title bond therefor from Nisewander during his infancy, of which purchase and title bond, as well as of the fact that respondent had paid a considerable part of the purchase money, the plaintiff had full notice at the time he made his purchase and obtained his title bond as aforesaid; that whether the plaintiff had such notice or not, respondent insists that having acquired the first equitable title, he had a right, notwithstanding his knowledge of any subsequently ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>quired equity of the plaintiff, to perfect his purchase, if he could, by obtaining a conveyance of the legal title; that although Nisewander was under age at the date of the title bond to respondent, yet it was not on that account void, but only voidable, and might be affirmed or disaffirmed at the election of said vendor, after he arrived at lawful age; that the sale and title bond to Wohlford were not a <em>disaffirmance, </em>but the deed to respondent was an <em>affirmance </em>of the said title bond to respondent, notwithstanding the payment of the additional sum of one hundred dollars as aforesaid, which was not intended, to change the original contract, but merely to induce its affirmance; which respondent had a right to do.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b361-4\">Nisewander, in his answer, admits the contracts of sale made by him with the appellant and Wohlford respectively, the former before and the latter after he became of age, and states that a considerable portion of the purchase money due under the former contract was paid, or attempted to be paid, in a house and lot for which he had no use, and owing to the advantage thus taken of him, he determined, before he became of age, and expressed the determination frequently and publicly, that he would not confirm the contract; that after he became of age he expressed the same determination to various persons, and among them to Wohlford, and offered to sell him the land, which Wohlford then bought; that after making this contract with Wohlford, he was, by the free use of liquor supplied by Powers, acting for Mustard, prevailed upon to make a deed for the land to Mustard, which he would not have done if he had been sober; that at the time of the execution of the deed Mustard paid him one hundred dollars more than the original contract price; and that the sale to Wohlford was a fair one, made when respondent was sober, for a fair consideration, and he had no desire to defeat it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Ap6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>The facts, as before stated, are fully proved by the evidence; which also tends to prove that the deed from hfisewander to- Mustard was obtained by undue and improper means practiced by the agent of the latter: but that fact is immaterial, in the view taken of-the ease by the court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b362-12\">\u2022\u2022On the 11th of April 1857 a decree was rendered in the cause, reciting that Wohlford having died pending the'suit, it had been revived in the name of his heirs, declaring the deed from Nisewander to Mustard to be fraudulent and void-, directing the same to be set aside and canceled, and that Mustard should convey to the said heirs all the title vested in him by said deed, and appointing commissioners to make partition as prayed for in the bill.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b362-13\">Prom that decree Mustard applied to this court for an appeal; which was allowed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b362-14\"><em>N.

That it is not a case for specific performance. To entitle Wohlford to sustain his bill, he must show that his vendor was in a condition to enforce a rescission of his contract with Mustard, and that he is entitled to ask the specific .execution of his contract with Nisewander. That Nisewander could not enforce a rescission, first, because he could not return the consideration he had received; and second, because, after coming of age, he had executed the contract by conveying the land to Mustard. And the plaintiff cannot sustain Ms bill,- because he could have no better equity than Else wander. And further, he knew when he purchased, that Mustard was in possession under a contract with Nlsewander, and had paid part- of the purchase money; which he would lose if his contract was avoided. At most, therefore, it was a case for compensation. <em>Armstead </em>v. <em>Hundley, </em>7 Gratt. 52; <em>Farrell </em>v. <em>McKinley, </em>9 Gratt. 1.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b363-5\">3d.

That admitting the contract with Mustard to be only voidable and not void, the sale and execution of his title bond by Nisewander to Wohlford, after eom<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>ing of age, was a disaffirmance of Ms contract with Mustard. <em>Tucker </em>v. <em>Moreland, </em>10 Peters\u2019 R. 58; 1 Parsons\u2019 Cont. 273; <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Burchen, </em>14 John. R. 124; <em>Cresinger </em>v. <em>Lessee of Welch, </em>15 Ohio R. 156; 1 Amer. Lead. Cas. 114, note. And whilst it was true that in the states where one out of possession of land cannot sell, the infant would be required to enter upon the land sold during his infancy, in order to avoid the sale; yet in this state, and under our present statute, no such entry is necessary to enable an infant to avoid Ms contract made during Ms infancy. 1 Amer. Lead. Cas. 114; 1 Parsons\u2019 Cont. 273, 274. And if the sale to Wohlford was a disaffirmance of his contract with Mustard, no subsequent act of his could affirm that contract. 1 Amer. Lead. Cas. 111.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b364-11\">2d. That the proposition was well established, that if during his infancy, an infant wasted or otherwise ceased to possess the property acquired by the contract, he was not thereby deprived of his right of election, and might nevertheless, on coming of age, avoid the contract, and take the property given in exchange. And that in this case, Mustard was in no situation to insist upon a different rule, since by Ms own act he has deprived the infant of the power to return the property acquired by the contract.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b364-12\">3d. That if it was true, as they contended, that the contract with Mustard was avoided by the contract with Wohlford, then Mustard had no equity either as against Nisewander or Wohlford; and having obtained the legal title with a knowledge of Wohlford\u2019s equity, he held it as trustee for Wohlford, and a court of equity would compel him to convey it to him. That not having an equity to insist upon the return of the property which he had transferred to ISiisewander as against him, he could have none on that ground against Wohlford.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b365-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>Moncure, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A4q\">delivered the opinion of the court:</p>\n<p id=\"b365-4\">The court is of opinion, that the contract of the 16th of January 1852, between Nisewander and the appellant, though made when the former was under age, and when that fact was known to the appellant, was not a void contract, but only voidable, and subject to be affirmed or disaffirmed by the former, after his arrival at age. \u201c The tendency of the modern decisions (says Chancellor Kent) is in favor of the reasonableness and policy of a very liberal extension of the rule, that the acts and contracts of infants should be deemed voidable only, and subject to their election, when they become of age, either to affirm or disavow them.\u201d 2 Kent Com. 235. The authorities on this subject are fully collected in the valuable notes of Hare &amp; Wallace, appended to the case of <em>Tucker, &amp;c. </em>v. <em>Moreland, </em>in 1 American Leading Cases, edition of 1857, p. 224-267. And from the numerous decisions which have been had in this country, the annotators deduce the following definite rule, as one that is subject to no exceptions. \u201c The only contract binding on an infant, is the implied contract for necessaries: the only act which he is under a legal incapacity to perform, is the appointment of an attorney; all other acts and contracts, executed or executory, are voidable or confirmable by him at his election.\u201d Id. 244. It is not material that the title bond in this case is in a penal sum ; though it has been said that a bond of an infant with a penalty is void. Coke Lit. 172 a; recognized as being still the law by Bayly, J. in 3 Maule &amp; Sel. 482. The penalty of the bond is a mere matter of form, the substance of the contract being the condition, on which may be maintained an action of covenant at law or a suit for specific performance in equity. See also 3 Rob. Pr. (new) 221-228.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">The court is further of opinion, that the said contract was <em>disaffirmed </em>by the contract of the 8th of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>November 1853, between Nisewander and Wohlford, made after the former arrived at age. There is no evidence, nor even pretence, of any <em>affirmance </em>of the former contract by Nisewander after he arrived at age and before he entered into the latter, which was but eight days after his arrival at age. On the contrary, he persisted, during that period, in declaring that he would not confirm the former contract. Then, the question is, Did not the latter amount to a disaffirmance of the former? A voidable act of an infant may be avoided by different means, according to the nature of the act; but, without undertaking to enumerate them, it is sufficient for the purposes of this case to say, that such an act may certainly be avoided by him, after he becomes of age, by an act of the same nature and dignity. Thus a feoffment may be avoided by a feoffment; a deed of bargain and sale, by a deed of bargain and sale; a title bond, by a title bond, &amp;c.; the two acts in these cases being of the same nature and dignity. It is not necessary, in order to produce that effect, that the latter act should <em>expressly </em>disaffirm the former. It is enough that the two acts are inconsistent with each other; in which case the former is disaffirmed by plain and necessary implication. The case of <em>Frost </em>v. <em>Wolveston, </em>1 Strange\u2019s R. 94, seems to have proceeded on this principle. There, an infant covenanted to levy a fine by a certain time to certain uses; and before he came of age he levied the fine, and by another deed, made at full age, he declared it to be to other uses : the court held that the last deed should be the one to lead the uses. So also did the cases of <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Carpenter, </em>11 John. R. 539; <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Burchin, </em>14 Id. 124; and <em>Tucke</em>r v. <em>Moreland, 10 </em>Peters\u2019 R. 58.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-12\">In these cases, deeds of bargain and sale were avoided by deeds of the same nature to other bargainees. In the last of them, Judge Story said the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>first two \u201care directly in point, and proceed upon principles which are in perfect coincidence with the common law, and are entirely satisfactory.\u201d In these cases, the first grantee was not in actual possession when the second deed was executed, but the land was either vacant, or the grantor remained in possession. If there be an adverse possession, then, it is said, in those states where one out of possession cannot sell, there should be an entry by the grantor in order to avoid the first deed by another. 1 Am. Lead. Cas. 257, and the cases cited. But no entry is necessary in those states in which one out of possession of real estate can sell his interest therein. 1 Parsons on Cont. 273. That is the case in this state, under the Code, ch. 116, \u00a7 4, 5, p. 500; which provides, \u201c that all real estate shall, as regards the conveyance of the immediate freehold thereof, be deemed to lie in grant as well as in liveryand that \u201c any interest in or claim to real estate may be disposed of by deed or will.\u201d <em>Carrington </em>v. Goddin, 13 Gratt. 587. But in this case, though the first vendee appears to have been in possession, when the second title bond was executed, such possession was not adverse to the vendor, but in subordination to the title which still remained in him, and which would have been conveyed by him independently of the statute, and without any actual entry. In any view of the case, therefore, the contract with Wohlford was a disaffirmance of the contract with the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-3\">The court is further of opinion, that the effect of such disaffirmance was to render the first mentioned contract void; to extinguish any interest in law or equity the appellant may have acquired under it; and to entitle Nisewander, or his vendee Wohlford in his name, to recover possession of the land in an action at law, and hold it free from any equity of the appellant. When a voidable contract of an infant is disai<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>firmed by Mm, <em>it is </em>made void <em>ah initio </em>by relation, and the parties revert to the same situation as if the contract had not been made. 1 Am. Lead. Cas. 259; <em>Boyden </em>v. <em>Boyden, &amp;c. </em>9 Metc. R. 519, 521. If the contract was one of sale by the infant, he becomes reinvested with his title to the property, and may demand and recover it, not only of the vendee, but of any other person who may have it in possession. The right of an infant to avoid his contract is an absolute and paramount right, superior to all equities of other persons, and may therefore be exercised against purchasers from the vendee. 1 Am. Lead. Cas. 258; citing <em>Myers, &amp;c. </em>v. <em>Sanders' heirs, </em>7 Dana\u2019s R. 506, 521, and <em>Hill </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>5 Smedes &amp; Marsh. R. 216, 224. He who deals with an infant deals at his peril, and subject to this right of the infant to disaffirm and avoid the contract. This is the case, even though he deal in ignorance of the infancy, and on the fraudulent representation of the infant that he is of full age. <em>Van Winckle </em>v. <em>Ketcham, </em>3 Caines\u2019 Cas. 323; <em>Conroe </em>v. <em>Birdsail, 1 </em>John. Cas. 127; and other cases cited in 1 Am. Lead. Cas. 249. <em>A fortiori, </em>it is the case where, as here, the dealing is with full knowledge on the part of the adult of the infancy of the other contracting party. While the effect of avoiding the contract of sale by an infant is, on the one hand, to entitle him to demand and recover the property sold, so it is, on the other hand, to entitle the other contracting party to demand and recover the consideration received by the infant, or so much of it as may then remain in his hands in kind. Indeed, if the infant, after arriving at age, and before any act of disaffirmance by him, alien any part of the consideration, or exercise any unequivocal act of ownership over it, or retain it in his hands in kind for an unreasonable length of time, he may thereby affirm the contract and render it absolutely binding. Id. 255. But if he has, during infancy, wasted, sold <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>or otherwise ceased to possess the consideration, and has none of it in his hands in kind on his arrival at age, he is not liable therefor, and may recover possession of the property sold by him (at least if the contract of sale be executory merely on his part) without accounting for the consideration received. \u201cThe true rule,\u201d as stated in Story on Cont. \u00a7 42, \u201cseems to be, that when articles are furnished to the infant which do not come within the definition of <em>necessaries, </em>and which are consumed or parted with; or when money is lent which is expended by the infant; the other party has no remedy to recover an equivalent for the goods or money; the specific consideration given by him being parted with, or not being capable of return. But when the specific consideration, whatever it be, exists, and remains in the hands of the infant at the time of the disaffirmance of the contract, and is capable of return, the infant is bound to give it up, and he is treated as a trustee of the other party, if the contract be made originally in good faith. The ground of such a distinction is, that in the first case the goods or money cannot be returned; and to make the infant liable therefor in damages, merely because they had been used by him, would be to deprive him of his privilege of affirming or avoiding his contract.\u201d See also <em>Boody </em>v. <em>McKenney, </em>23 Maine R. 517.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-4\">In the case of an <em>executed </em>sale by an infant, it has been held that if he disaffirm the sale and seek to recover back the article sold, he must restore the purchase money or other consideration; <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>5 Humph. R. 70; <em>Badger </em>v. <em>Phinney, </em>15 Mass. R. 359, 363; and if he go into chancery to set aside his conveyance, he must offer in his bill to restore the purchase money; <em>Hillyer </em>v. <em>Bennett, </em>3 Edw. Ch. R. 222. Without expressing any opinion upon this question, it is sufficient for the purposes of this case to say, that no case of an <em>executory </em>contract of sale by an infant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>has been found, in which the infant, disaffirming the contract after his arrival at age, has been held accountable for the consideration received and spent by him during his infancy; but all the authorities on the subject seem to be the other way.^jlf the infant in any such case has delivered possession of land contracted to be sold by him, he has an unconditional right to recover it back in an action at law; and a court of equity will not restrain him from doing so, nor impose terms upon the exercise of his right. Such was the decision of the court in <em>Brawner &amp; wife </em>v. <em>Franklin, &amp;c. 4 </em>Gill\u2019s R. 463. Dorsey, J. in delivering the opinion of the court, said, \u201cEstablish the doctrine now contended for, and what is the result? Why, that the whole policy of the law as to infantile incompetency to sell, waste and dispose of their property and estates, is frustrated.\u201d \u201cAn infant may sell his patrimonial estate, prodigally waste the purchase money in extravagance, gambling and dissipation; and if, when arrived at years of maturity and discretion, he disaffirm the contract, and sue at law for the' recovery of his property, a court of equity will, by injunction, arrest the arm of the law, and say to him, Before you shall further assert your claim to your estate, you must repay to the purchaser all the money you have received from him.\u201d To such a doctrine the court refused to subscribe, and, we think, rightly so.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-12\">The court is further of opinion, that the appellant having no equity in regard to the land when he obtained the deed of the 18th of November 1853, and having obtained it with full knowledge of the equity of Wohlford, can derive no benefit from the said deed, but holds the legal title acquired under it in trust for the heirs of Wohlford, and may be compelled by a court of equity to convey said title to them. A purchaser for valuable consideration without notice of a prior equity, and having the legal estate, is entitled to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>priority in equity as well as at law, according to the maxim, that where equities are equal, the laity shall prevail. He is a great favorite of a court of equity, and has been protected to such an extent as to be allowed to take advantage of a deed which he stole out of a window by means of a ladder, and of a deed obtained by a third person without consideration and by fraud. <em>Flagg\u2019s </em>Case, cited in 1 Vern. R. 52; <em>Harcourt </em>v. Knowel, cited in 2 Vern. R. 159; and <em>Culpeper\u2019s </em>Case, cited in 2 Freem. R. 124. \u201c These, however (it has been well said), were extreme cases, showing indeed how partial equity is to a purchaser, but carrying the doctrine of protection further than it would be at the present day.\u201d 2 White &amp; Tudor\u2019s Eq. Cas. 6, notes to <em>Basset </em>v. <em>Notworthy; 2 </em>Sugd. Vend. 1020. And it has been held that a purchaser \u201c shall not protect himself by taking a conveyance from a trustee after he had notice of the trust; for by taking a conveyance with notice of the trust, he himself becomes the trustee, and must not, to get a plank to save himself, be guilty of a breach of trust.\u201d <em>Saunders </em>v. <em>Dehew, 2 </em>Vern. R. 271. If, therefore, the appellant could be regarded as a <em>bona fide </em>purchaser when he obtained the deed from Nisewander, he could derive no protection from that deed, which was obtained from a mere trustee of the legal title for Wohlford, and with full knowledge on the part of the appellant of the existence of the trust. Indeed, if he had then been a <em>bona fide </em>purchaser, he would not have needed the deed for his protection against Wohlford, who, in that case, would have been a purchaser with notice of <em>his </em>prior equity. But the appellant cannot be regarded as a purchaser at that time. He had received no conveyance, and paid only a part of the purchase money. His purchase was never more than voidable, and had been <em>avoided; </em>and he ceased to have any equity, in regal\u2019d to the land j but Nisewander was left free to dispose of it as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>if he never had sold it to the appellant. So that Wohlford\u2019s purchase, though made with notice of the prior sale to the appellant, was entirely unaffected thereby, the same having been disaffirmed and avoided. And the appellant, having obtained the deed with full notice that the person from whom he obtained it was a mere trustee 'of the legal title for Wohlford, became himself a mere trustee of that title, and bound therefore to convey it to Wohlford\u2019s heirs.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-12\">The court is further of opinion, that any claim which the appellant may have on account of payments made under the original contract with him, or as a consideration for the execution of the said deed, is a personal claim against Nisewander, and cannot be enforced in this suit. It has been already shown that the appellant has no interest in or claim to the land itself. Nor has he any in or to the purchase money, if any, due by Wohlford. If he has, he must have derived it from the deed. But <em>that </em>is a conveyance of the land, and not an assignment of the <em>purchase money. </em>It is adversary to the sale to Wohlford, and not in subordination to it. A claim founded thereon is in conflict with the specific execution of Wohlford\u2019s purchase, to which he is entitled, and which is the purpose of this suit. Such claim, therefore, cannot be enforced in this suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-13\">The court is further of opinion, that it suffieiently appears from the recital contained in the decree appealed from, that the cause had been duly revived in the name of the heirs of Wohlford; <em>Craig </em>v. <em>Sebrell, </em>9 Gratt. 131; but at all events, the appellant has no right to complain of any irregularity in that respect, the said decree being in the name and in favor of said heirs, and they being parties to and defending this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-14\">The court is therefore of opinion, that there is no error in the said decree to the prejudice of the appel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>lant. But the court is further of opinion, that as it does not appear that the whole purchase money due by Wohlford had been actually paid when the said decree was rendered, though it had then become payable ; and as the said land was subject to a lien for so much of the said purchase money as may then have remained unpaid; the said decree should have been without prejudice to such lien, and to any proceedings for the enforcement thereof which the said Nisewander or his assigns might be advised to institute; and that the said decree should be amended in that respect, and as amended affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-4\">Decree amended and affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
