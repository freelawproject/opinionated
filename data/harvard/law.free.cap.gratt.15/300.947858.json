Yancey against R. C. Mauck, Allan C. Bryan and others, to subject an interest in a tract of land sold by Yancey to Mauck, to the payment of a debt which Yancey insisted was a lien upon the land. The facts, as they appear from the pleadings and proofs, are as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b328-14\">Some years prior to 1850 Leyton Yancey died, leaving a widow and four children. One tract of land was assigned to the widow for her dower; and of course the reversion was in the children.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b328-15\">On the 20th of April 1850 Robert L. Yancey sold his interest in the tract of land which had been assigned to the widow, to Robert C. Mauck; for which Mauck bound himself to pay to Yancey one thousand dollars, of which five hundred dollars was to be paid on the 20th of April 1851, and five hundred dollars on the 20th of April 1852. And Yancey bound himself to convey the same with general warranty, when the first payment was made. At the same time Mauck purchased the interest of another of the heirs in the land, and upon the same terms: and afterwards he purchased a third interest.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b329-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>It appears that Zebulon Shafer had married one of the children of Leyton Yancey, and had sold his interest in some of the lands owned by his wife, to Robert L. Yancey, and that one thousand dollars of the purchase money fell due about the 1st of October 1850. This money Yancey wished to pay; and Mauck applied to Shafer to know if he wanted the money immediately, and being told he did not, Mauck proposed to give his bond for the amount. This Shafer agreed to, but required security; and although Mauck declined to give the security at the time, at the November term of the County court for 1850 he executed his bond with Yancey as his surety for one thousand and ten dollars, that being the amount of principal and interest due from Yancey to Shafer up to the 1st of December, when the bond was made payable.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b329-4\">Upon Mauck\u2019s executing his bond to Shafer, Yancey delivered up to him his two bonds for five hundred dollars each, which Mauck had given to him for the purchase money of the land; and they were destroyed. Some time after this, Yancey spoke to Mauck about Ms making a deed for his share of the land, saying he had fixed a time to do so, but was disappointed in it; when Mauck replied that it was immaterial to Mm when he made it, as he had no deeds for the other interests, and Yancey could take Ms own time to make it. Nothing further was said on the subject between them; and the deed was not made.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b329-5\">In 1855 Mauck had become embarrassed in his circumstances; and in April of that year he conveyed the land he had purchased from Yancey with other property to John C. Woodson in trust to secure Allan O. Bryan and Franklin Pence as his securities. This deed described the land as having been conveyed to Mauck by Yancey, and the deed as duly recorded in the clerk\u2019s office of the County court of Rockingham. Bryan in his answer states that at the time of the con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>veyance to Woodson, he had not the slightest knowledge of iny prior lien upon the land, and did not hear of any such lien for a considerable time afterwards. And he states and proves by Mauck that the latter had frequently told him that Yancey had been paid in <em>full; </em>but that the other two had not.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b330-10\">It appears that on the 21st of April 1852 Mauck paid Shafer on his bond four hundred and fifty dollars. In 1855 Shafer brought suit upon the bond against Mauck and Yancey, and recovered a judgment, which was satisfied by Yancey; Mauck having then become insolvent; though at the time of executing the bond and for some time thereafter he was in good credit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b330-11\">Yancey in his bill insists that Shafer had a lien on the land for the amount of Mauck\u2019s bond; and the prayer of the bill is that that lien may be enforced for his benefit, and for general relief.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b330-12\">When the cause came on to be heard, the court dismissed the bill. Whereupon Yancey applied to this court for an appeal; which was allowed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b330-13\"><em>Baldwin, </em>for the appellant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AMJ\">referred to the facts, and insisted that the arrangement between Yancey, Mauck and Shafer was no more in effect than the assignment of Mauck\u2019s bonds for the purchase money to Shafer; and Yancey having been compelled to pay the debt, he was entitled to the vendor\u2019s lien upon the land.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b330-14\">He insisted further, that Yancey\u2019s right to subject the land stood on higher ground than the vendor\u2019s lien. That he never having conveyed the legal title, a court of equity will, not compel him to convey it until he is paid. And whatever may have been the forms of the transaction, certainly Mauck had not paid the purchase money, nor had Yancey received it. He referred to <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>Caperton's ex'or, </em>8 Gratt. 148, and <em>Knisely </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>3 Gratt. 265.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b330-15\">He insisted further, that Bryan could occupy no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>higher po\u00a1? tion than Mauck. He was obliged to know that Mauc ; had no title; and he was therefore affected by any eq: ity which Yancey had against Mauck. He was not a\u2019 mrchaser of the legal title without notice; for he was not a purchaser of the legal title at all; and he advanced no money, but was a mere surety of Mauck, and did not deal on the faith of this property as a surety.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b331-4\"><em>Grattan, </em>for the appellees,, insisted:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b331-5\">1st.

This right of the vendor to resort to the estate, constituted an implied equitable lien, the creature of a court of equity founded on the supposed intent of the parties, from which an implied contract was inferred. B ut the rule was not unbending. The circumstances might show there was no such intent, and therefore no such implied contract could be raised. But what circumstances should have such effect, created the difficulty in the practical enforcement of the rule. A receipt for the purchase <em>money </em>endorsed on the conveyance, or taking a bond, note, bill of exchange or check or other instrument involving the mere personal liability <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>of the vendee, did not discharge the lien. But where other security was taken, it was considered that as the party had carved out his own security, it was a substitution for the lien implied by law. The question, however, to what extent the taking a distinct security shall be regarded as a waiver, has been much controverted. So much so, that Lord Eldon seemed to consider that it could not be known in any case, without, the judgment of a court, whether, under the circumstances of each case, the taking such security amounted to declaration plain or manifest intention of a purpose to rely not any longer upon the estate, but upon the personal credit of the individual. Owing to this uncertainty, and to the perplexing litigation growing out of the claim of the vendor to enforce this equitable claim for purchase money against purchasers of the legal title for value, the revisors recommended that the vendor\u2019s equitable lien be abolished; and the Code, eh. 119, \u00a7 1, p. 510, provides, that if any person hereafter convey any real estate, and the purchase money or any part thereof remain unpaid at the time of such conveyance, he shall not thereby have a lien for such unpaid purchase money, unless such lien is expressty reserved on the face of the conveyance. The statute abolishes the lien where the vendor has conveyed the legal title, and has not reserved it on the face of the deed. It does not apply to the case where the title has been retained by the vendor, for the obvious reason that in such case the principles of our statutes requiring mortgages or deeds of trust to be recorded, was not infringed upon, and because purchasers for value of the legal title would not be endangered by parol proof of notice. Holding back the deed, or what is the same thing, depositing it as an escrow, until payment of the purchase money was made, was from the first regarded as evidence of an intention to resort to the land if necessary. And it was from deci<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>sions of cases of this character that the doctrine as subsequently developed took its origin. The first case in which the principle was distinctly enounced, was the case of <em>Chapman </em>v. <em>Tanner, 1 </em>Vern. R. 267; where the chancellor said, \u201c that there is a natural equity that the land should stand charged with so much of the purchase money as was not paid; and that without any special agreement for that purpose.\u201d Lord Eldon, in <em>Mackreth </em>v. <em>Symmons, </em>15 Ves. R. 330, 343, says this case was imperfectly reported ; and in <em>Fawell </em>v. <em>Heelis, </em>Amb. R. 724, Lord Apsley said, \u201c that it appeared by the register\u2019s book, that the vendor retained the title deeds till he was paid. And the court said that a natural equity arose <em>from his having the title deeds in his </em>custody.\u201d And in the same case it is said that <em>Pollexfen </em>v. <em>Moore, </em>3 Atk. 272, is very inaccurately reported, \u201c as by reason that the purchase money was not paid, he kept the title deeds.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b334-10\">Among the circumstances to repel the presumption of an intention to resort to the estate, is the making of a conveyance of the legal title : a circumstance always sufficient to repel the presumption as against a <em>bona, fide </em>purchaser from the vendee having the legal title. But a purchaser or incumbrancer of a mere equitable title must take the place of the person from whom he purchases. The vendor may resort to the estate whether a purchaser of the mere equitable estate from his vendee, purchased with or without notice. For want of notice, or the payment of a valuable consideration, cannot place him in a more advantageous position than his vendor. As between the vendor and vendee, the latter occupies the position of a tenant at sufferance to the former. The vendor may assert his legal title and recover possession of the premises by ejectment, and so disaffirm the executory agreement to sell; or if he elects to go into chancery, the proceeding is more correctly a bill for the specific <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>execution of the contract by requiring the vendee to complete his purchase by paying the price, or otherwise have the subject sold at his risk, than a bill to subject the property to a mere equitable lien.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-4\">That a vendor retaining the legal title-occupies a position different from and higher than one who has parted with the legal title and relies on the mere implied equitable lien, is not only clear from the considerations aforesaid, but is shown by the authorities. Notwithstanding the doubts of Lord Eldon, it may now be considered as well established that where the vendor who has conveyed, takes a personal collateral security, binding others as well as the vendee, as a bond or note with security, the lien on the land does not exist. But in the case of <em>Hatcher's adm'x </em>v. <em>Hatcher's ex'ors, </em>1 Rand. 53, the purchaser gave bond with security for the purchase money, but received no conveyance ; and it was decided that the right of the vendor to resort to the land was not lost by having taken personal security. In that case, a suit at the instance of the security to subject the land for his indemnity, was sustained, before he had been compelled to pay himself. And upon the same principle it was held in <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>Caperton\u2019s ex'or, </em>8 Gratt. 148, that the vendor retaining the legal title may resort to the land as against creditors and incumbrancers of the vendee, although the vendee had subsequently executed a deed by which he conveyed other property to secure the purchase money.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">The distinction between the implied lien where the legal title is parted with, and the right of the vendor who has retained the title to enforce a specific execution, is clearly drawn in the cases of <em>Brush </em>v. <em>Kinsly </em>and <em>Adams </em>v. <em>Stillwell, </em>14 Ohio R. 20. The judge says, \u201c The lien of the vendor results from the fact that equity holds the vendee clothed with the legal title, a trustee of the vendor for the payment of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>purchase money. Before the legal title passes from the vendor on a contract for the sale of land, there is no such lien. The vendor\u2019s remedy in such case is on the contract either to enforce a specific performance of the contract, or in an action at law. The vendee cannot compel a relinquishment of the legal title until he clothes himself with equity by the payment of the purchase money.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b336-4\">In <em>Clark </em>v. Hall, 7 Paige\u2019s R. 382, it was held, that where there is an unexecuted contract for sale, the vendor may file a bill to have specific execution, and then have the land sold for his debt. To the same effect were the cases in this court, of <em>Hatcher </em>v. <em>Hatcher </em>and <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>Caperton, ubi supra, </em>and <em>Knisely </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>3 Gratt. 265; <em>Hanna </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>3 Gratt. 243; <em>Hopkins </em>v. <em>Cockerell, </em>2 Gratt. 88; <em>Beirne\u2019s ex\u2019ors v. Campbell, </em>4 Gratt. 125; <em>Stuart\u2019s ex\u2019ors </em>v. <em>Abbott, </em>9 Gratt. 255.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">In <em>Hanna </em>v. <em>Wilson </em>it was held, that although an action on the promissory note given for the purchase money might have been barred at law, yet as the vendor retaining the title could sue in ejectment at law, or file a bill for specific execution, and subject the land in default of payment, his right in equity was not affected by any lapse of time short of the period sufficient to raise the presumption of payment, whatever might be the operation of the statute of limitations in an action at law instituted upon the promissory note. A similar' proposition was affirmed in <em>Hopkins </em>v. <em>Cockerell. </em>The cases of <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>Caperton's ex\u2019ors, Stuart\u2019s ex\u2019ors </em>v. <em>Abbott </em>and <em>Beirne\u2019s ex\u2019ors </em>v. <em>Campbell, </em>before referred to, show that the intervention of a purchaser without notice, or a <em>bona fide </em>incumbrancer, does not obstruct-the right of the vendor to charge the land. The case of <em>Beirne </em>and <em>Campbell </em>carried the principle so far as to hold that though a purchaser has obtained the legal title, and had no notice that there was purchase money due to a previous <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>vendor, yet if his vendor had not the legal title when he purchased, the land is liable for the purchase money due to the previous vendor.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-4\">The cases of <em>Hanna </em>v. <em>Wilson </em>and <em>Knisely </em>v. <em>Williams </em>also determine that in such case the assignee for value of a note given for the purchase money of land, may maintain a suit against his assignor, the vendor and the vendee for a specific execution of the contract, in a case proper for such relief, and subject the land to the satisfaction of his claim, agreeing in this respect with the almost uniform current of decisions in this country where the vendor has not parted with the title; although there is more conflict of decision whether the vendor\u2019s <em>implied lien </em>where he has parted with the legal title accompat ies the assignment of the vendee\u2019s note or bond for le purchase money. See note to <em>Mackreth </em>v. <em>Symmons, </em>1 White &amp; Tudor\u2019s Lead. Cas. in Equity 245, where the cases are collected.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">An application of these principles to the facts of the case under consideration, leaves no doubt in my mind of the right of the appellant to resort to the land in controversy for satisfaction. The contract of sale was executory; the appellant bound himself to make a deed to the appellee E. C. Mauck when the first payment was made. Before the bonds for the purchase money fell due, an arrangement was made, by which the vendee, with his vendor the appellant as security, executed their bond to a creditor of the vendor for the amount of the purchase money, for which amount the creditor gave the appellant credit, and the bonds executed by the vendee were surrendered. The effect of the arrangement was the same as if the appellant had assigned his vendee\u2019s bonds for the purchase money in discharge of a debt, continuing responsible as assignor; or as if he had given to his creditor, in discharge of his own debt, an order on his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>vendee for the amount of the purchase money, and which the vendee had accepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-10\">These arrangements did not change the character of the debt; it still consisted of the purchase money due <em>for </em>the land. Whether it should be paid to the vendor directly, or to a third person for his relief, and the discharge of his debt, did not change the nature of the consideration. The vendee becoming embarrassed, executed a deed of trust upon this, with other property, to secure some of his creditors; and failing to pay the substituted bond executed for the purchase money, his security the appellant was compelled to pay it. The arrangement, to the extent of the failure to pay, fell through. The purchase money was not paid; the vendor did not obtain relief from his debt. He was compelled to pay it; nominally as the security of the vendee, in reality because it was originally his own debt which his vendee had bound himself to pay out of the purchase money due to him. Whatever might be the position he occupied at law, in equity which regards substance and not form, he stood as the unpaid vendor retaining the legal title. If the case stood alone between him and his vendee, could the latter compel him to relinquish the legal title until he had clothed himself with equity by the payment of the purchase money? Would he be heard to say that by shuffling the securities the purchase money was satisfied, though he had never paid and his vendor had never received a cent ? Would he not be told, in the language of the president of this court in <em>Watts </em>v. <em>Kinney, </em>3 Leigh 272, 295, \u201cThat a court of equity looks to substance, not to form, that it looks to the <em>debt </em>(here the purchase money) which is to be paid, not to the <em>hand </em>which may happen to hold it; that the fund (here the land) charged with its payment, shall be so applied, whosoever may be the person entitled; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>and that it considers a debt as never discharged, until it is discharged by payment to the proper person, and by the proper person.\u201d So this court held in <em>Knisely </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>3 Gratt. 265; a case somewhat similar in its circumstances to the present. There the vendor of land took a bond for the purchase money and retained the title to the land. He afterwards agreed with the vendee to receive an order on a third person, payable at a distant day, for the amount of the bond. The order xvas given and the bond surrendered; but when the order was presented, the drawee refused to accept. It was held that the surrender of the bond and taking the order did not discharge the land, and that the vendor, upon the refusal to accept the order, could proceed forthwith, the purchase money being due at the date of the order, to enforce the specific execution of the contract, obtain a decree for the payment of the purchase money, and to subject the land to sale for the satisfaction thereof. Such would, as it seems to me, be the condition of these parties, if there had been no incumbrancers. As to them, the authorities show they must abide by the condition of their debtor. No fraud or misrepresentation is imputed to the vendor. They should have looked to the registry to ascertain whether their debtor had a legal title. The appellant has been guilty of no default; and their negligence can give them no equity against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-4\">I think the decree dismissing the bill is erroneous, and should be reversed with costs, and the cause remanded with instructions to enter a decree in conformity with the precedent in <em>Knisely </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>to execute the contract by requiring the appellant to execute a deed with general warranty to the appellee R. C.

Mauck for the balance of the purchase money unpaid, with interest thereon from the time the same became payable, and the costs of this suit; and furthermore to decree and order, that the appellant do make to said appellee E. C. Mauck a deed conveying his interest in the land described in the contract, dated the 20th of April 1850, filed as an exhibit in the cause, with covenants of general warranty, and acknowledge the same in order to be recorded, and file the same with the papers in the cause; and if the debt, interest and costs aforesaid be jsaid within thirty days after the deed shall have been so filed, that said appellee, on such payment, have leave to withdraw said deed, leaving an attested copy thereof: And unless said debt, interest and costs shall be paid by the appellee E.
