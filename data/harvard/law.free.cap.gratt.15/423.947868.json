After stating the case, he proceeded as follows :</p>\n<p id=\"b453-8\">In the case of <em>Gallego's ex'ors </em>v. <em>The Attorney </em>General, 3 Leigh 450, it was held, that the English doctrine in regard to indefinite charities does not prevail in this state; that it was founded, mainly if not entirely, upon the statute 43 Elizabeth, called the statute of charitable uses, which, if it ever was in force here, was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>repealed by the general repealing act of 1792; that charitable bequests stand on the same footing with us as all other bequests, and will alike be sustained or rejected by courts of equity; and that a bequest of money to be applied to the erection and support of a Roman Catholic chapel in Richmond, and a devise of a lot in said city to trustees in fee, upon trust to permit all and every person belonging to the Roman Catholic church, as members thereof, or professing that religion, and residing in Richmond at the time of the testator\u2019s death, to build a church on the lot for the use of themselves and all others of that religion who may hereafter reside in said city; were uncertain as to the beneficiaries, and therefore void.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-11\">The authority of that case, although some of the positions therein held have been impugned elsewhere, and although the case of <em>The Baptist Association </em>v. <em>Hart's ex'ors, </em>4 Wheat. 1, therein much relied on, has been supposed to have been founded on a misconception of the English law <em>(Vidal, &amp;c. </em>v. <em>Girard's ex'ors, 2 </em>How. U. S. R. 127), is still firm and stable in this state, except so far as it may have been since modified by statute; having been repeatedly recognized by this court, and expressly affirmed in the recent case of <em>Brooke, &amp;c. </em>v. <em>Shacklett, </em>13 Gratt. 301.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-12\">The devises and bequests contained in the will and codicil of Nathaniel Seaburn, now under consideration, would undoubtedly be void for uncertainty, according to the principles of the case of <em>Gallego's ex'ors </em>v. <em>The Attorney General, </em>before cited. Indeed, this seems not to have been controverted in the argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-13\">But the counsel for the appellant contended that they are valid devises and bequests, under the Code, ch. 77, \u00a7 8, p. 362; which is as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b454-14\">\u201cEvery conveyance, devise or dedication shall be valid, which since the first day of January 1777 has been made, and every conveyance shall be valid which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>hereafter shall be made, of land^Hce use or benefit of any religious congregation as a place for publffe worship or as a burial place or a residence for a minister; and the land shall be held for such use or benefit and for such purpose and not otherwise.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">On the other hand, the counsel for the appellees contended that the said devises and bequests are not valid, under the Code: First, because it does not authorize a <em>devise, </em>but only a <em>conveyance, </em>as contradistinguished from a <em>devise; </em>and, if it does, secondly, because it only authorizes <em>land to </em>be given for the purposes therein mentioned, and not <em>money, </em>though it be directed to be applied to the erection of a church on land held for such purposes; and much less, if it be directed to be applied to other purposes, as for instance, the support of a minister; and thirdly, because the devises and bequests in question are void for uncertainty, even though they might otherwise be valid under the Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">Let us now consider the first of these objections taken by the counsel of the appellees, to wit, that a <em>devise </em>is not authorized by the above recited provision of the Code. If <em>this </em>objection be tenable, it will be unnecessary to consider the others, as <em>this </em>will conclude the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-7\">There can be no doubt but that the word \u201c conveyance,\u201d in its comprehensive, and perhaps in its technical sense, embraces a devise ; and if it had been the only word used by the legislature in the provision in question to express the mode of transfer, it might, reasonably, have been construed in that sense; especially as it is used in that sense in other parts of the Code, as in ch. 116, \u00a7 1, 11. But we know that in common parlance, the word is often used in a more restricted sense, as contradistinguished from <em>devise </em>/ and that it has often been so used in our most important acts of legislation; as for example, in the act concerning conveyances, 1 Rev. Code 1819, ch. 99. It <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>is like the . rchase,\u201d which, technically, em-l^races a devise; but is generally used in a more restricted sense, and as meaning an acquisition of property by contract only. In the provision in question, <em>\u201c </em>conveyance\u201d is not the only word used to designate the mode of transfer therein mentioned. The section begins, \u201c Every <em>conveyance, devise or dedication </em>shall be valid, which since the 1st day of January 1777 has been made;\u201d thus tending to show that the word \u201cconveyance\u201d was not used here as comprehending \u201cdevise or dedication;\u201d otherwise, it is presumable that these latter words would not have been used. But the section immediately proceeds: \u201c and every <em>conveyance </em>shall be valid which hereafter shall be made,\u201d &amp;c.; thus dropping the words \u201c devise or dedication,\u201d used in the first line of the section. We cannot suppose that the legislature, in three consecutive lines, in which the only stop is a comma, would have used the words \u201c conveyance, devise or dedication,\u201d as to the past, and the word \u201c conveyance\u201d only as to the future, without meaning something by the change of phraseology; without meaning more by the <em>\u2022three </em>words first used, than by <em>one </em>of them repeated in the same sentence. The legislature obviously intended to use the word \u201c conveyance\u201d in its restricted sense; and while they sanctioned every \u201c conveyance, devise or dedication,\u201d which since the 1st day of January 1777 had been made, they determined to establish a new rule for the future, and to authorize only a \u201c conveyance\u201d (that is, by deed) for the purposes mentioned in the section. That this was their intention, is rendered, if possible, more manifest by the manner in which the section, as proposed by the revisors, was amended and adopted by the legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-8\">The section, as proposed by the revisors, was in this language: \u201c Every conveyance, devise or dedication shall be valid, which since the 1st day of January <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>1777, has been <em>or </em>hereafter shall be made,\u201d &amp;c. There could be no mistake as to the meaning of the section thus proposed; which was made, if possible, still more plain by a long note appended thereto. If it had been adopted by the legislature as proposed, it would expressly have authorized a devise in future. It was so adopted by the house of delegates. But it was amended in the senate, by striking out the word \u201c or,\u201d in the third line, and inserting, in lieu thereof, the words, \u201c made, and every conveyance shall be valid which;\u201d so as to make the section read: \u201c Every conveyance, devise or dedication shall be valid, which since the 1st day of January 1777, has been <em>made, and every conveyance shall be valid which </em>hereafter shall be made,\u201d &amp;c. This amendment was agreed to by the house, and the section so amended was adopted, and became a law as it now stands in the Code. It seems to be inconceivable that this amendment would thus deliberately have been made, if it had not been intended to confine the word conveyance, remaining in the section, to its restricted sense, and not to authorize for the future a devise or dedication for the use of a religious congregation. No other motive for making it has been assigned, or seems to be assignable. It could not have been made for the purpose of saving words. If that had been the purpose of the legislature, they would have struck out the words \u201c devise or dedication,\u201d in the first line of the section, and inserted no other; thus leaving the word \u201c conveyance\u201d to operate in the same comprehensive sense (embracing every mode of transfer by act of the parties),' as well in regard to the past as to the future. So far from saving, they increased the number of words; by striking out <em>one </em>and inserting <em>eight. </em>But their purpose being not to authorize a devise in future for the use of a religious congregation, it occurred to them as the most natural and easy mode of effecting that purpose, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>to let the words \u201cconveyance, devise or dedication\u201d /land in reference to the past, but to use the word \u201c conveyance\u201d alone in reference to the future. It is a word at least of equivocal import, and its meaning in this instance is sufficiently explained by the context.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-11\">It was argued by the counsel for the appellant, that the jealousy of church encroachments which existed at the time of the revolution, and for a period thereafter, has long since ceased, that the policy of the state on this subject has undergone a material change, and that we ought now to apply a liberal, and not a strict, rule of construction to a statute authorizing the acquisition of property for religious uses.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-12\">It is not perceived that there has been any such material change of the policy of the state as the counsel supposed. No trace of any such change is to be found in the first amended constitution of 1830, nor in the case of <em>Gallego's ex'ors </em>v. <em>The Attorney General, </em>decided so late as 1832. The opinion of President Tucker in that case, in which the policy of the state is so ably vindicated, has since met with general, if not universal approbation ; which seems to be still unabated. In the amended constitution of 1851 it was, for the first time, provided, as a part of our organic law, that \u201cthe general assembly shall not grant a charter of incorporation to any church or religious denomination ; but (it is added) may secure the title to church property to an extent to be limited by law.\u201d Art. iv, \u00a7 32. The object of this section was to prevent the accumulation of church property, and to authorize the title only to so much as might be deemed necessary, and consisted with the welfare of the state, to be secured by law to religious uses. The latter part of the section seems to have been designed to sanction and authorize such legislation as had already been adopted to secure the title to church property to a limited extent, and which had been introduced by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>the act of February 3,1842, entitled \u201c.an act concerning conveyances or devises of places of public worship.\u201d Sess. Acts, p. 60, ch. 102. The revisors recommended, in their report to the legislature, a more liberal provision on this subject than had been made by that act. They proposed not only that conveyances and devises (as provided by that act), but parol dedications of land should be authorized for the use or benefit of any religious congregation as a place for public worship, <em>or for religious or other </em>instruction, or as a burial place or a residence for a minister. And also that books, furniture <em>or other things, </em>\u201c given or acquired for the benefit of such congregation, to be used on the said land in the ceremonies of public worship, <em>or in religious or other instruction, </em>or at the residence of their minister,\u201d should \u201c stand vested in the trustees having the legal title to the land, to be held by them as the land is held, for the benefit of the congregation.\u201d Rep. Rev. p. 412, \u00a7 8 and 10. And they suggested, that if the legislature should prefer it, the 10th section could readily be made more extensive in its operation, by substituting therefor the following : \u201c When any money or other thing shall be given by will or otherwise to, or be otherwise acquired by or for, any congregation having for its use or benefit such land as before mentioned, the same shall stand vested,\u201d &amp;c. Id. note. The legislature not only did not adopt this suggestion, but amended the 8th and 10th sections proposed by the revisors, not only by limiting the mode of future acquisition of land to a conveyance as before stated, but by striking out the words in italics above written, to wit, the words \u201cor for religious or other instruction,\u201d in the 8th, and the words \u201c or other things,\u201d and the words \u201c or in religious or other instruction,\u201d in the 10th section: Thus embodying in the Code a more limited scheme of church endowment than had been provided by the act of 1842.</p>\n<p id=\"Afh\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>Under these circumstances, we think we ought not to apply a very liberal rule of construction to the statute, but to construe it according to the general rule. And so construing it, we think the <em>conveyance </em>by which ^ authorizes a transfer of land to be made for the use of a religious congregation, does not embrace a <em>devise. </em>We think the legislature plainly intended to alter the pre-existing law, by not authorizing such a transfer of land by devise in future. Whether the reason for the alteration was good or not, is a question which it belongs not to this court to decide. We may readily conceive what that reason was. And we must admit that the danger of an excessive and inordinate alienation of property to religious uses, so jealously guarded against by the policy of our law and the provision of our constitution before referred to, would be greatly increased by authorizing such alienation to be made by will, as well as by deed. And especially so, if the argument of the appellant\u2019s counsel be correct, that a religious congregation may take and hold (by its trustees) not only land, but money, and <em>that </em>without limit, provided it be to be laid out in land of the quantity and for the purposes prescribed by the statute, or in the erection of a church or a residence for a minister thereon, or in repairing the same, or in the purchase of books or furniture to be used on said land in the ceremonies of public- worship, or at the residence of the minister. The legislature may well have supposed that there was no necessity for encountering this increased <em>danger; </em>and - that authority in future to convey land for the purposes aforesaid by deed only, would fully answer the object in view. ^</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">If a devise of land for the purposes aforesaid would be void, <em>a fortiori </em>a bequest of money, though to be laid out in building a church on land held for such purposes, and much more, to be invested in stock for the support of a minister to preach in said church, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>would be void. The statute says nothing about money ; and the only argument used to sustain the validity of the bequest in this case, is that the money is equivalent to land, according to the doctrine of equitable conversion.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-3\">It may be proper to state that nothing in this opinion is intended to be in conflict with the opinion delivered in the case of <em>Brooke, &amp;c. </em>v. <em>Shacklett. </em>The conveyance in that case was by deed, executed before the adoption of the present Code; and it was not intended to express any opinion upon the question, whether a <em>devise </em>for the use of a religious congregation is authorized by the Code, which did not arise in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-4\">For the foregoing reasons, and without expressing any opinion upon the other objections taken to the validity of the devises and bequests in question by the counsel for the appellees, the court is of opinion that the said devises and bequests are void and that the decree of the Circuit court be therefore affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">Allen, P. concurred in the results of the opinion of the court, but not in the reasons given for it. He thought that the term \u201c conveyance\u201d was sufficient to embrace devises. But he was of opinion that according to <em>Gallego's ex'ors </em>v. <em>The Attorney General, </em>3 Leigh 450, affirmed as that case was by <em>The Literary Fund </em>v. <em>Dawson, </em>10 Leigh 147, and <em>Brooke </em>v. Shacklett, 13 Gratt. 301, the bequest was void: and that this case was not embraced in the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">Decree affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
