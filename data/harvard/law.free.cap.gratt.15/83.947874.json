The contract and lien under the statute may he assigned, and the assignee may enforce the lien in the same mode that the mechanic might do it.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b111-15\">3. By the contract for building a house, the builder is to furnish the materials and to build the house in a workmanlike manner, and the price is to he fixed by referees chosen by the parties. Soon after the work is finished, it is valued and the price fixed; hut after-wards defects become apparent by the shrinking of the timber, showing that the work was executed in a very defective and unworkmanlike manner. The valuation does not conclude the owner of the house; but he is entitled to compensation for the defects: and in a suit by the assignee of the builder to enforce the lien for the price for building the house, the owner will only be required to pay what the building was really worth.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b111-17\">4 A building fund company agrees to advance to one of its members money to build a house on a lot owned by him, and advances a part of the money and takes a lien upon the lot and the buildings which may he erected upon it, to secure the advances made and to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>made. The member then makes a contract for the building of o house on the lot, with a mechanic who, to raise money faster thae it can be gotten from the company, assigns the contract to a person who undertakes to advance the money; and the contract is recorded, so as to create the mechanic's lien. After the contract is recorded, the company advances money from time to time, as it had agreed to do, which is paid to the assignee in part satisfaction of his advances to the mechanic, with a knowledge on his part, that it comes from the company, and that the company claims priority of lien upon the property. The company is entitled to priority over the mechanic\u2019s lien, for its advances made after the contract was recorded, as well as for its advances made before.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b112-3\">5. Before decreeing a sale of the house and lot, the court should determine the priorities as between the building fund company and theassignee of the mechanic\u2019s lien. And it is error merely to decree a sale and direct the proceeds to be brought into court.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b112-5\">6. The wife of the grantor in the deed of trust to secure the building fund company, having joined in that deed, the property should be sold out and out, and first applied to the payment of the debt due to the company. But she has a contingent dower interest in the equity of redemption, and being a party in the suit, and therefore hound by the decree in the cause, the court should make a proper provision to compensate that interest out of the surplus proceeds of sale, if any, before any part of it is paid over to the assignee of the building contract.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b112-7\">7. A copy of the valuation of the referees, is filed with the bill, and though noticed in the answer, is not objected to. It is received by the commissioner who settles the accounts, as evidence, and no call is made for the original before him; hut there is an exception without date, endorsed upon it as being but a copy. The exception either came too late, or was waived by the party.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b112-15\">Lewis laege being the owner of a <em>lot of </em>ground ia the city of Richmond, on which he desired to erect a small dwelling-house, at a cost of some six hundred or six hundred and fifty dollars, and holding also five shares in the Richmond building fund company, he applied to that company for the loan of a sum of money for the purpose of erecting such a dwelling. The company agreed to lend him the money, upon the terms prescribed in their articles and by-laws, by which the money was to be advanced from time to time as the house progressed, and the whole was to b\u00ae <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>secured by a deed of trust on the property. The company advanced laege one hundred and twenty dollars, and he and bis wife, by a deed bearing date the 20th day of August 1852, duly recorded, conveyed the lot and buildings then or which might be put upon it, for the purpose of securing this sum and any further sums which might be lent him for the purposes aforesaid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b113-6\">Having made the arrangement with the Building fund company for getting the money, laege then contracted with William H. Martin, a carpenter, for building the house; but Martin being very much embarrassed, and fearing that his creditors might disturb him if they knew he had the contract for building the house, the name of John Warthen was substituted for his in the written agreement. This agreement, which bears date the 28th day of September 1852, provides that Warthen shall build a house of a given description, \u201cthe work to be executed in a workmanlike manner,\u201d and when completed, it was to be valued by referees chosen by the parties, and the value of the building so fixed was to be the price thereof. When the roof was upon the building, laege was to pay to Warthen two hundred and fifty dollars; and when the building was completed, he was to pay two hundred and fifty dollars more; and the residue was to be paid within twelve months from the date of the completion of the building, by equal monthly payments, bearing interest from that date.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b113-7\">As Martin had no money, and required it to enable him to carry on the work faster than laege could get it from the Building fund company, an arrangement was made by him with Louis J. Bossieux, who undertook to advance the money; and the contract was assigned to him by Warthen: and on the 29th of September 1852 it was admitted to record in the clerk\u2019s office of the Hustings court of the city of BichmoncL, upon the acknowledgment of laege and Warthen.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AO3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>Martin seems to have proceeded forthwith to build the house; and referees having been chosen as prov^e(^ *n agreement, they on the 25th of February 1853 made out their estimate, and valued the building at eight hundred and eighty-six dollars and eighty-six cents. Of this sum, Iaege had paid, during the progress of the work, or in March 1852, six hundred dollars. To make these payments, it was known to the parties that he was to receive and did receive money upon loan from the Building fund company; and in addition to the sum of one hundred and twenty dollars received by him before the execution of his deed of trust, after that deed was executed and after the contract between himself and Warthen had been assigned to Bossieux and recorded, he received from the company the further sum of four hundred and sixty-one dollars; which was paid to Bossieux, with the knowledge on his part that it was obtained from the company.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b114-5\">On the 12th day of September 1853 Louis J. Bossieux instituted a suit in equity in the Circuit court of the city of Richmond, against Lewis Iaege and his wife, the Richmond building fund company, and the trustees in the deed to secure the company before mentioned. In his bill he sets out the contract, its assignment to him, and the record thereof, the completion of the building, the appointment of the referees, and their valuation; of which he exhibited a copy, and the payments made by Iaege. He says there is still due to him near three hundred dollars, which Iaege had failed to pay; and he insists that his contract having been recorded, he has a lien upon the property under the statute, Code, ch. 119, \u00a7 2, p. 510. He refers to the deed of trust to secure the Building fund company; and says that the company claims a prior lien upon the property; and asks for a sale of the property for the payment of his claim; and for general relief.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b115-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>laege answered the bill at great length. He says that he made the contract with Martin who did the work; that before making the contract he told Martin that he could not pay more than six hundred or six hundred and fifty dollars for the house, and that he would not build at all if it could not be done for that amount; and that Martin assured him it would not cost more. He declares that he never intended to give a lien upon the property by the record of the contract, and was ignorant that such would be its effect. He insists that the contract has been violated, in that the work has not been done in a workmanlike manner; that the materials used were not suitable and properly seasoned; the door panels are split, the facings warped, the chimney piece shrunk, and various defects that could not be so well discovered when the work was valued by the referees, have since become strikingly apparent as the work has become seasoned: And he insists that he has already paid fully as much as the work is worth.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b115-7\">The trustees of the Building fund company also answered, insisting upon their prior lien for the amount they had lent to laege; charging that the plaintiff and Martin knew that laege was to get the money from the company to build the house, and to give the lien to secure it; and that the plaintiff, when he received the money from the company, was informed that the company claimed a priority of lien for the money so paid to him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b115-8\">In March 1854 the court made an order in the cause, directing a commissioner to report, first, the amount due from laege to the Building fund company at the date of the recordation of the contract with Warthen: second, whether the company had advanced to laege any sums of money to the satisfaction of said builder\u2019s contract, after the contract was recorded; and if so, how much, and to whom such advances <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>were made: third, the balance doe to the plaintiff: fourth, the value of the real estate in the trust deed mentioned, in its improved condition. And in June -j S54 the commissioner reported, that at the date of recorc\u00a1ati0n of the building contract the Building fund company had advanced to laege one hundred and twenty\" dollars, of which he had repaid, in monthly installments, twenty dollars: that after the recordation of the contract the company had paid, or advanced, on the of December, to L. J. Bossieux and John Warthen two hundred and thirty-two dollars; and in March 1853 to the same parties two hundred and twenty-nine dollars \u2014 equal to four hundred and sixty-one dollars: and that there was due from laege to Bossieux two hundred and eighty-six dollars and eighty-six cents. On the fourth subject referred, the commissioner returned the depositions of two witnesses, and says, one of them values the property at from six to seven hundred dollars, and the other from six to six hundred and fifty dollars. The balance reported to be due to Bossieux was based on the valuation of the referees, a copy of which was before the commissioner, and seems not then to have been excepted to; though afterwards an exception without date was. endorsed upon it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b116-6\">Several witnesses were examined as to the materials and workmanship of the building; the substance of which is stated in the opinion of Judge Lee. The allegations in the answer on that point, seem to be fully sustained. .</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b116-7\">The cause came on to be further heard on the 27th of November 1855, when, there having been no exception to the commissioner\u2019s report, it was confirmed; and it was decreed, that unless within ninety days laege or some one for Mm paid to the plaintiff the sum of two hundred and eighty-six dollars and eighty-six cents, with interest from the 25th of February <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>1853 until paid, and his costs, a commissioner should proceed to sell the house and lot, in the mode and on the terms stated in the decree, and deposit the proceeds in the Bank of Virginia to the credit of cause, and report his proceedings to the court. From this decree laege and the Richmond building fund company applied for and obtained an appeal to this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b117-4\"><em>B. B. Minor, </em>for the appellants, insisted:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b117-5\">1st. That the suit was instituted before the right of action had arisen. The payments over the sums provided to be paid during the progress of the work and on its completion, were to be paid in twelve months from the time the building was finished, in equal monthly installments. The whole of this residue was not due until the 25th of February 1854, and when this suit was instituted, had not become payable. And the statute, Code, ch. 119, \u00a7 2, p. 510, provides, that the builder\u2019s lien shall not continue more than six months from the completion of the building, unless a suit in equity to enforce the lien shall have been commenced within the said six months. He referred to <em>Kinney </em>v. <em>Hudnat, 2 </em>Scamm. R. 472; <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Alexander, </em>10 Smedes &amp; Marsh. R. 627; <em>Thaxter </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>14 Pick.

That the building contract was not recorded with the intention to create a lien on the property, nor with the knowledge on the part of laege that it would have that effect; and therefore no lien was created by it. <em>Hutchison &amp; wife </em>v. <em>Rust, 2 </em>Gratt. 394; <em>Alexander &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Newton, </em>Id. 266; <em>Blessing\u2019s adm\u2019r </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number><em>Beatty, </em>1 Rob.

That the balance reported to be due to Bossieux erroneous. jr^-g^ because there was no legal proof 0p \u00a3jje vaiuaf;ion 0f the referees, there being only what purported to be a copy of that valuation, and that excepted to. But second, because the proofs are conclusive to show that the house was not built in a workmanlike manner, but that both the materials and the workmanship were very inferior, and were full of defects, which could not be seen or discovered when the valuation was made soon after the completion of the work, and in the winter. That laege was therefore not concluded by the valuation of the referees, but had a right to an abatement of the estimated price, and should be charged only what the house was really worth. He referred to <em>Heck </em>v. <em>Skener, </em>4 Serg. <em>&amp; </em>Rawle R. 249; Chitty Contr. 450-51, 574-75; <em>Cawthorn </em>v. <em>Courtney, </em>6 Gratt. 381; <em>Warren </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>2 Gilm. R. 307.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b118-6\">4th. That the Building fund company were entitled to a prior lien for the whole amount of their advances : that the parties had full knowledge that the contract for the building was to be carried out on Iaege\u2019s part, and could only be carried out by him, by means of the money to be advanced by the company on the security of the house and lot; and Bossieux himself received the money from the company, with the full knowledge that they claimed to have the prior lien for all their advances, and without \"then disputing their claim. He referred to 1 Story\u2019s Equ. Jur. \u00a7 401, 417; 2 Id. \u00a7 1237, and note; <em>Cox </em>v. <em>Romine, </em>9 Gratt. 27.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b118-7\">5th. That the building contract was not assignable so as to give the assignee the mechanic\u2019s lien. The statute gives the lien to the person who has done the work, but not to his assignee. Sess. Acts 1842-3, p. 53; Code, ch. 119, \u00a7 2, p. 510; <em>Bottomly </em>v. <em>Grace </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number><em>Church, 2 </em>Calif.

The sale of the property is decreed, without any provision for the widow\u2019s right of dower in the equity of redemption, after satisfying the lien of the Building fund company, in which she joined. That equity of redemption includes the buildings put upon the lot. <em>Shaeffer </em>v. <em>Weed, </em>3 Gilm. R. 511; <em>English </em>v. <em>Foote, </em>8 Smedes &amp; Marsh.

And the sale is also decreed without first adjusting the priorities of the liens ; which this court has held to be error. <em>Cole's adm'r </em>v. <em>McRae, </em>6 Rand. 644; <em>Buchanan </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>10 Gratt. 164.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b119-12\"><em>Morson, </em>for the appellee: Upon the first point made by the appellants\u2019 counsel, to show the right of an assignee to sue in equity to enforce a lien, referred to <em>Hanna </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>3 Gratt. 243; <em>Winn </em>v. <em>Bowles, </em>6 Munf. 23; 2 Story\u2019s Equ. Jur. \u00a7 1040, 1250. And to show that the assignee may sue before all the installments are due, he referred to 3 Rob. Pr. 361, 362; <em>Paul </em>v. <em>Dod, 2 </em>Man. Gr. &amp; Scott 800; <em>Mussen </em>v. <em>Price, </em>4 East\u2019s R. 147; 2 Parsons\u2019 Cont. 486, note k; <em>Hanna </em>v. <em>Mills, </em>21 Wend. R. 90; 1 Story\u2019s Equ. Jur. \u00a7 64 k, 67, 68, 457; 2 Id. \u00a7 717 a, 718. And he insisted that the provision in the statute referred to, was only intended to prevent delay in enforcing the lien.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b119-17\">2d. That though Iaege swears he did not intend to give a lien by the record of the building contract. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>there is no proof of the fact; but the contract was recorded on his acknowledgment; and Bossieux re-to lend the money unless the contract was , , recorded.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AK3\"><em>gfl' </em>insisted, that the value of the building was ascertained in the mode prescribed in the contract, and there was no suggestion that the referees had not acted honestly in making their valuation; and the parties were concluded by that valuation. <em>Kidwell </em>v. <em>The Baltimore &amp; Ohio R. R. Co. </em>11 Gratt. 676. That the exception to the copy of the valuation was without date, and was obviously taken after the report of the commissioner had been returned. That copy was filed with the bill as an exhibit; and though referred to by Iaege in his answer, was not objected to.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b120-8\">4th. The Building fund company is not postponed absolutely to Bossieux. The amount due the company when the contract was recorded is held to have priority. According to the general rule, Bossieux is next entitled, and then the company for the money advanced after the contract was recorded. But the decree does not postpone the company to this extent, but simply directs The sale, and that the money be deposited in bank; and the question of priority may be hereafter adjusted. And this is the usual practice; it not being common to settle the priorities in the decree directing the sale.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b120-9\">5th. There is nothing in the cases cited on the other side to sustain the proposition that the assignee of the contract is not entitled to the lien ; nor is there any thing in the statute to authorize the proposition. It would be most injurious to the mechanic if it were so, as it would lessen the value of the lien to him, by precluding its use in raising money to enable him to execute the work.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b120-10\">6th. The deed to secure the Building fund company, conveyed the dower interest of Mrs. Iaege; and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>the whole property was therefore properly decreed to be sold. She had but a contingent interest in the equity of redemption, and was only entitled to have her interest secured out of the balance of the purchase money; and as she is a party in the suit, that could have been and can yet be done.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b111-18\"> Code, ch. 119, \u00a7 2, p. 510. \u201c If a person owning or having an interest in land, in a city or town, shall by a writing signed by him, contract with another to pay him money for erecting or repairing any building, or the appurtenances of any building on such land, there shall be a lien for such money on the whole interest of the said person in such land, from the time that the said writing is duly admitted to record in the county or corporation wherein the said land lies. But the said lien shall not be in force more than six months from the time when the money, or the last installment of the money to be paid under such contract, shall become payable, unless a suit in equity to enforce the lien shall have been commenced within the said six mouths. If in such suit the lien be established, the court shall order a sale of such interest in the land, to satisfy the money which ought to be paid under such contract.\"</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b121-9\">Lee, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AJp\">The jurisdiction of this court in this case is, I think, clear and unquestionable. Assuming that the matter in controversy is merely pecuniary, it is not confined to the amount claimed by the appellee but embraces also the amounts claimed by the Building fund company and for which as. they allege they are entitled to priority of payment out of the proceeds of the subject. These alone exceed the sum necessary to give the jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-10\">There is as little doubt, I think, of the jurisdiction of the court of equity in the matter of the bill. Its jurisdiction is denied by the counsel for the appellant upon his construction of our act creating the \u201c mechanic\u2019s lien,\u201d Code, ch. 119, \u00a7 2, p. <em>510; </em>and if his construction were correct, there would be grave doubt of the right of a party claiming as assignee of such a contract as that which is the foundation of the appellee\u2019s demand, to come into equity to obtain payment of such of the installments as had become due merely upon the ground that he was assignee. But I do not think the construction contended for is correct. The act first declares that there shall be a lien for the money agreed to be paid upon a contract for erecting or repairing any building, &amp;c. from the time that the same is duly admitted to record, and then provides that \u201c the said lien shall not be in force more than six months from the time when the money or the last installment of the money, to be paid under such contract, shall become payable, unless a suit in equity to enforce the lien shall have been commenced within <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>the said six months.\u201d The object of this provision was to prescribe a limitation to suits to enforce such a lien by specifying a period after which they might not be brought but not one before which they might not be commenced. It intended to give the mechanic the right to assert the lien for all the installments whenever due (where the contract price was payable in installments) provided he commenced his suit before the expiration of the six months after the last installment became due, but not to prevent him from proceeding for previous installments before the last became payable. His right to sue for these depends on general principles and is not restricted by the act; and no one has ever questioned that a party who has a debt due by bond payable in installments and secured by a lien on real estate may maintain covenant, or file his bill to enforce his lien as soon as any one installment becomes payable, whatever may be the doubt as to the. right to maintain debt until all of the installments shall have become due: ' And where such a bill has been filed and other installments shall become due pending the suit, the uniform practice, never questioned so fivr as I know, has been to decree payment of all the installments that shall have fallen due up to the time of the decree, and if there be any to becomb due thereafter to provide that the party may come in on the foot of the decree to obtain satisfaction of the same out of the surplus proceeds, if any there should prove to be. To this practice I can see no well founded objection. It would be useless and occasion unnecessary costs and delay to require the party to commence a new suit or even file a supplemental bill whenever another installment shall fall due; and the defendant in making his defence as to the first installment may if he please make it to any or all of the others or may obtain leave to do so in proper time afterwards.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>I have examined the.cases cited by the counsel on this point but have seen in them no reason to doubt the correctness of my construction of the statute. The cases apparently most resembling this case are those of <em>Kinney </em>v. <em>Hudnut, 2 </em>Scamm. R. 472; <em>Pryor </em>v. <em>White, </em>16 B. Mon. R. 605; <em>Bartlett </em>v. <em>Kingan, </em>7 Harris Penn. R. 341; <em>McClallan </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>11 Cush. R. 238; and <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Alexander, </em>10 Smedes <em>&amp; </em>Marsh. R. 627. But they were upon statutes differing in some respects from ours, and they do not touch the particular point made here. The case of <em>Kinney </em>v. <em>Hudnut </em>merely decides that under the statute of Illinois, there can be no cause of action until the contract is completed and payment is due. In that case there was no special contract as to the time when the work was to be paid for. In <em>Bartlett </em>v. <em>Kingan, </em>the claim was for work done and bricks furnished on an entire contract for the erection of a house, and it was held that under the Pennsylvania statute, the six months\u2019 limitation commenced to run from the completion of the contract, and that the party was in time if his claim was filed within that period after the last quantity of bricks was furnished and laid. Here the demand was for an entire sum due in whole upon the completion of the contract. In <em>Pryor </em>v. <em>White, </em>it appears that under the Kentucky statute the lien is to be enforced by bill filed within one year from the completion of the work, and that the party in that case had taken notes for the work some of which would not fall due until after the year: and it was held that as he had thus by his voluntary act placed himself in a position which rendered him unable to bring a suit to enforce the lien as to them within the year, he was to be regarded as having virtually waived it. <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Alexander </em>was a case under the Mississippi statute which required the suit to be brought within twelve months from the time the money was to be paid in order to secure the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>lien. The plaintiff had furnished lumber to the de\u00bb fendant for a house in 1844, the proper time of pay-for which was the 1st of January 1846; and in 'May 1845 he had taken the defendant\u2019s note for the amoun\u00a3 payable one day after date, but the petition to enforce the lien was not filed until April 1846. ' It was held that the party could not deviate from the original contract and extend the time when according to it the lien would attach, and as the petition had not been filed within twelve months from the time when payment was to be made, it could not be maintained. In <em>McClallan </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>which was a case under the Massachusetts statute, the contract was to do the work during the season ensuing its date, which was the 30th of May 1845; the contractor did part of-the work in 1845 but did not complete it until May 1846, and the property having been conveyed to others, he sought to enforce his lien against them. It was held that although he would have been entitled to compensation for the work he did during the season of 1S45, because his failure to complete the building was occasioned not by his default but by that of the owner in furnishing materials, and to have his lien enforced to that extent if he had commenced his suit in due time; yet as he had not filed his petition within six months from the time when the amount due for the work done in 1845 would have been payable according to an equitable adjustment under the contract, his lien was lost and the land discharged of the incumbrance : the court being of opinion that the work done after the season in 1845 was to be regarded as done under a subsequent parol agreement, which did not continue the former lien nor create a new one.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">Thus it will be perceived, as I think, that these cases all differ in their distinctive features from our case and give but little aid in settling the true construction of our act. Nor have I seen any sufficient <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>reason for applying a different rule to the lien which st creates from that which obtains in other cases of liens for money payable in installments. I think the party could come into equity to enforce the lieu as soon as either installment became due, and that when he did so, the court could properly make provision for the others. In this view it is unnecessary to enter into the doctrine of assignments for the purpose of determining how far without such lien, the appellee could have maintained himself in that court upon the footing of his assignment alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">But the counsel for the appellants goes still further and insists that there never was a lien at all because the contract was not acknowledged by laege and admitted to record for the purpose of creating a lien, nor did he know that such would be the effect. Or if it must be held that there is a lien, that it is not assignable and consequently the appellee has no footing in court to enforce it for bis benefit.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">Nothing is said in the act about the intention with which the contract is admitted to record, nor is any certificate required of the purpose for which it may be acknowledged or recorded. The appellee, it appears, who was to advance the money refused to do so unless the contract was recorded, and to overcome this difficulty, laege went to the clerk\u2019s office and acknowledged it for that purpose. No fraud or imposition is alleged to have been practiced upon him, and his ignorance of the legal consequences of recording the contract cannot prevent the lien from having effect. Otherwise it would be a fraud upon the appellee who has advanced his money upon the faith of the rights thereby acquired. I think it clear therefore that the party must be deemed when he acknowledged the contract and assented to its being recorded, to have known that it would create a lien or at least that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>he was content to abide by all the legal effects and <em>legitimate </em>consequences of its being so recorded.</p>\n<p id=\"ALH\">Nor do I think that the position taken by the coungej ^at such a lien is not assignable can be maintained. By the act of 1819 it is declared that assignments of all bonds bills and promissory notes and other writings obligatory whatsoever, shall be valid; and that an assignee of any such, may thereupon maintain any action in his own name which the original obligee or payee might have brought. 1 Rev. Code 1819, p. 484, \u00a7 5. In the Code of 1849, the declaration that such assignments shall be valid is omitted, and it is simply provided that the assignee of any bond, note, or writing not negotiable, may maintain thereupon any action in his own name which the original obligee or payee might have brought; the revisors, I presume, supposing that to give the action to the assignee in his own name sufficiently affirmed the validity of the assignment without any express declaration to that effect. Code, ch. 144, $ 14, p. 583. Now I see no reason why the assignee in this case could not maintain an action at law in his own name upon this contract. It seems to me to be fully embraced by the terms of description both in the Code of 1819 and that of 1849. But if this may be questioned, no reason is shown why it may not be regarded as assignable for value in equity. It is said and authorities have been cited to show, that such a statute is to be construed strictly, and it is contended that it is intended exclusively for the beneiit of the builder and material-man. No case has been cited affirming that a contract under such a statute cannot be assigned. There is nothing in public policy or in the language or the policy of our act to forbid it; and if the statute be exclusively for the benefit of the builder and material-man it would certainly impair the value of his lien to declare <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>it uon-assignabie. It might prejudice him by depriving him of credit which he might otherwise obtain to prosecute his undertaking, and thus also operate a disadvantage to the owner. Whilst the latter can in respect be injured by the assignment, because the assignee takes the obligation subject to the same equity to which it was subject in the hands of the obligee and must allow all just discounts not only against himself but against the assignor before notice of the assignment.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">I can perceive no reason for distinguishing between contracts of this character and other <em>choses in action ex contractu </em>in respect of the right to assign them. And it cannot be doubted that when the assignee takes the contract, he acquires with it the lien as a necessary incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-7\">I proceed next to consider the complaint made of the amount for which the decree was rendered.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-8\">By the contract the work about the bouse was to be executed in a workmanlike manner, whilst the proofs in the cause tend strongly to show that it was in fact executed in a very defective and unworkmanlike manner. It is proven that the doors were very much cracked (one of the witnesses says \u201c cracked to pieces\u201d) and that they were too small from shrinking, were made of green or wet timber and that numerous holes were found in them; that the staircase had given way and the steps had sunk from a half to three-fourths of an inch below the skirting; that the wash-boards had left the floors or the floors had sunk from half an inch to an inch; that the mantles were badly executed and much <em>shrunken; </em>that the plastering was not well done, that the weather-boarding was very much split and shrunken for want of a sufficient lap and that the piazza in the rear was badly and improperly constructed. All the witnesses examined upon the subject agreed that the materials must have been green <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>or unseasoned and that the work was not done in a workmanlike manner but was very defective; and they think it was worth much less than was to be paid for it if executed in the manner required by the con\u00bfracj;o jt is true it was provided that the work when completed was to be valued by referees and the price was to be fixed by their valuation. But such a valuation would of necessity be based upon the condition in which the work appeared at the time it should be made, and it could not have been intended to deprive the party of the right to compensation for material defects in the work that were not discoverable at the time of the valuation but only became apparent after-wards. And as numerous and marked defects were subsequently disclosed the award of the referees as to the value of the work in its apparent condition at the time should not be held conclusive. It appears that the valuation was made by the referees immediately after the completion of the house in February 1853; the work was then just finished, freshly painted and plastered <em>; </em>every thing appeared right except perhaps the defective manner of the construction of the piazza in the rear, and it was not until after the materials used had become seasoned during the ensuing summer and fall that their defective character was exposed in the numerous flaws and defects which became strikingly apparent in various parts of the building, and thus invited attention as well to the materials themselves as to the manner in which they had been wrought.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">If the price of the work had been fixed in the contract and the party had paid it immediately on its completion, or if he had been sued and judgment recovered for the amount before the faulty and defective workmanship had discovered itself, it will scarcely be said that he would have been thereby deprived of the benefit of his contract for work done in a workman<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>like manner, and of compensation for material defects which were subsequently disclosed. Nor can I think that the measurement and valuation made by the referees should under the circumstances of this case, have any greater effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-4\">The case of <em>Kidwell </em>v. <em>The Balt. &amp; Ohio R. R. Co. 11 </em>Gratt. 676, has been cited by the counsel for the appellee upon this point; but it will be found I think upon examination to decide nothing incompatible with the conclusion I have arrived at in this case. That was a bill filed to obtain compensation for extra work and deficiencies in estimates of the value of work done, upon certain contracts for the construction of bridges on the line of the company\u2019s road. These contracts provided for monthly estimates to be made of the quantity character and value of the work by an engineer designated, and when the work should be fully completed and accepted by the engineer, for a final estimate of the same, when the balance appearing to be due was to be paid to the contractor upon his executing a release of all demands against the company. There was a further provision that these estimates should be conclusive between the parties unless altered by the principal engineer to whom power was reserved to review the same and make alterations if he should choose to exercise it. The complaint on this branch of the c\u00e1se was that the estimates had all been made upon an improper and erroneous construction of the contracts, to the great prejudice of the contractor, and that he should not be bound by them on that account and also because of fraud and mistake imputed to the officers in effecting the contracts and making the estimates. The court held that neither fraud nor a mistake was made out in proof, and that in the absence of both, the final estimate of the engineer was conclusive between the parties. It v\u00edas also held that whatever might be the true construction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>of the contracts yet as the estimates had been made upon a particular construction of which the contractor fully informed at the time and had received the \u2018monthly estimates based upon it without objection, }ie must be held to have acquiesced in that construction and to be bound by it; and that if he might have refused to abide by the final estimate, yet having made no objection to the engineer\u2019s proceeding to make it, and having attended upon him for that purpose and submitted his charges for the work done, he was concluded by the engineer\u2019s action. In this case the very matters sought to be controverted had been formally and directly submitted to and adjudicated by the referee, all the elements which should enter into his estimate were perfectly known at the time and the contractor by his acts and declarations, had acquiesced' in the principles upon which he had attained his results. I can perceive nothing in this decision which touches the particular question in the case in judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">It is contended on behalf of the Building fund company that they were entitled to priority of payment out of the proceeds of the sale of the property, both as to the one hundred and twenty dollar's advanced to laege before the building contract was recorded, and the four hundred and sixty-one dollars advanced and paid to the appellee afterwards; and on behalf of both the appellants it is insisted that the Circuit court should have so adjudicated before it directed a sale of the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">The counsel for the appellee does not contest the priority claimed for the one hundred and twenty dollars, and he contends that upon the face of the commissioner\u2019s report and the decree of which it is the basis, this is impliedly conceded and should be regarded as sufficiently recognized: but he does contest the priority claimed as to the four hundred and sixty-one dollars paid after the building contract was re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>corded, and he argues that as the money arising from the sale was not disposed of by the decree but directed to be deposited in bank to the credit of the cause, court could afterwards decide upon the priorities thus no one would be prejudiced\u00bb</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">It is a well settled rule that where there are conflicting claims to priority of payment out of the proceeds of land about to be sold to satisfy the liens upon it, the court in order to prevent the danger of sacrificing the property by discouraging the creditors from bidding as they probably might if their right to satisfaction of their debts and the order in which they were to be paid out of the property, were previously ascertained, should declare the order of payment before it decrees the sale to be made. <em>Cole's adm'r </em>v. <em>McRae, </em>6 Rand. 644; <em>Buchanan </em>v. <em>Clark, &amp;c., </em>10 Gratt. 164. It is therefore not sufficient that the court should direct the fund to be paid into court and should declare the priorities afterwards. The purpose for which it is done requires that it should precede the sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-9\">I do not see any thing in the report of the commissioner or the decree of the court confirming it which amounts to a declaration or recognition of the priority of the Building fund company even as to the one hundred and twenty dollars. The report simply states the facts, and the decree, after confirming the report, directs that if the balance stated to be due the appellee be not paid within ninety days with interest and costs, the property should be sold and the proceeds after paying the costs and expenses of the sale, paid into bank to the credit of the cause. Nothing is said in it in relation to either claim of the Building fund company, and the failure to adjudicate as to the order of payment is, I think, a material error in the decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-10\">As to the Building fund company\u2019s right to priority as to the one hundred and twenty dollars, no objection <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>is made, nor can its right to such priority as to the four hundred and sixty-one dollars, be successfully contested. When the company advanced the one hundred and twenty dollars to Iaege for and on account of the redemption of a share held by him in the stock of the company, they took from him a deed of trust upon the property to secure the payment of that sum as well as of any other sum or sums they might thereafter advance on account of the redemption of other shares. This arrangement was fully within the terms of the charter and the by-laws of the company, and was the mode in which the main object of the association was carried into effect, and it was well known to Martin, Warthen and the appellee at the time the contract for building the house was executed and when the same was assigned to the appellee. The deed of trust was duly admitted to record before the contract for building was entered into, and when it was made and assigned to the appellee, it was perfectly well known to all these parties that the principal part of the funds to <em>be </em>paid for the work was to come from the Building fund company and to be advanced by it on the security of the deed of trust which they had taken; and accordingly they required Iaege by the contract to give good security for the excess of the cost of the building above the five hundred dollars expected from the company. And when the money was paid to the appellee, he knew that it was paid by the company on the security of the deed of trust, and with the understanding on their part that they were to be indemnified in preference to any other claimant, and it was accepted and received by him in payment for materials furnished and work done upon the very property without objection and without protest as to the justness of the expectation with which it was paid. To permit the appellee now to repudiate his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>recognition of the priority of the company\u2019s claim would operate a virtual fraud upon them and would be most uniust and inequitable.</p>\n<p id=\"AtE\">I think therefore the Building fund company is entitled to priority in payment of the proceeds of the property as well of the four hundred and sixty-one dollars advanced in redemption of stock as of the one hundred and twenty dollars advanced in that way at the time the deed of trust was executed.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">There are two other points which perhaps should be briefly noticed.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">An exception was taken to the paper offered as evidence of the measurement and valuation of the work by the referees because it purported to be a copy and not the original. This exception is without date and it does not appear when it was in fact taken. But the paper was filed as an exhibit with the bill and although the answers are very full and elaborate no objection is taken to the paper on that account nor is any call made in them for the original. The paper was also received by the commissioner as evidence, there was no call made for the production of the original before him nor does he report that any objection was made to the paper because it was but a copy. The exception therefore either came too late or must be regarded as having been waived by the parties, and it was properly disregarded by the Circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-8\">The remaining point relates to the contingent dower interest of the wife of the appellant Iaege in the property. It is said that this was not affected by the mechanic\u2019s lien, and that the court therefore should not have sold the entire estate, but only the interest of Iaege. That the mechanic\u2019s lien does not override the dower interest of the wife is very clear, and if any authority to the point were needed, it would be found in <em>Shaeffer </em>v. <em>Weed, </em>3 Gilm. 511. But Mrs. Iaege had united with her husband in the deed of trust for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>benefit of the Building fund company, and if a sale takes place it must be to raise the amount due the as well as that due to the appellee. It would be proper therefore that the property should be sold ou\u00a3 anc\u00a1 011\u00a3; ]jU\u00a3 as \u00a3[ie wjfe jias a contingent dower interest in the equity of redemption and being a party to the cause, is to be bound by the decree, the court should make a proper provision to compensate that interest out of the surplus proceeds of sale, if any, after satisfying the amounts due the Building fund company before any part of the same shall be paid over to the appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-7\">I am of opinion to reverse the decree and remand the cause for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-8\">The other judges concurred in the opinion of Lee, J.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-9\">The decree was as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b134-10\">The court is of opinion that the Circuit court did not err in maintaining the jurisdiction of the court of equity to grant the relief prayed for by the bill, nor in disregarding the exception to the copy of the measurement and valuation of the referees filed as an exhibit with the bill, nor in holding the appellee entitled to a decree for all of the installments of the price of the work although part thereof only became due pending the cause. But the court is of opinion that before decreeing a sale of the property, the Circuit court should have directed an enquiry by a commissioner into the alleged defects in the work done in the execution of said contract which were disclosed and became apparent after the valuation made by the referees, and should have ascertained what would be a just compensation to the appellant laege for such defects, and should have caused the same when so ascertained to be accounted for out of the balance due the appellee if sufficient to satisfy the same, before any amount should be decreed to him on said contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>And the court is further of opinion that before decreeing a sale of the property, the Circuit court should have adjudicated the priority of payment out of the proceeds thereof as between the appellee and the Building fund company, and should have declared the said company entitled to such priority both as to the one hundred dollars balance of what was paid before, as well as to the four hundred and sixty-one dollars paid after the said building contract was admitted to record.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-4\">And the court is further of opinion that it was proper the said property should have been decreed to be sold out and out, but that inasmuch as the wife of the said laege is entitled to a dower interest in the equity of redemption after satisfying the purposes of the deed of trust, and as she is a party to the cause the court should make a suitable provision for the preservation of such dower interest out of the surplus proceeds of sale after satisfying the demands of the Building fund company, before any part thereof should be paid over to the appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">Wherefore the court is of opinion that there is error in said decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">Therefore reversed with costs and remanded with instructions further to proceed in the same according to the principles herein before declared.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-7\">Decree reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
