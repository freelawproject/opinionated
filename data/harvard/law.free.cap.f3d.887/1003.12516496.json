BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Factual History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   This case arises out of the oil fields of western North Dakota. Our story begins around January 2009, when Statoil entered into two agreements with a Hess affiliate. One of those agreements the parties call the \"Rough Rider Agreement.\" The Rough Rider Agreement prohibited Hess for one year from acquiring any oil or gas interests in the Rough Rider Prospect (a sizable swath of land in North Dakota's McKenzie and Williams Counties) in exchange for Hess's affiliate receiving certain proprietary information from Statoil.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    1. The Tomahawk Agreement\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On October 8, 2009, still within the one-year non-compete period, Hess entered\n   into a series of agreements (collectively, the \"Tomahawk Agreement\") with Spring Creek, Gold Coast, and non-party Coachman Energy relating to the Tomahawk Prospect, a collection of land lying entirely within the much larger Rough Rider Prospect. As one part of the Tomahawk Agreement, Spring Creek and Gold Coast sold all of their oil and gas leasehold interests (covering about 5,400 net acres) in the Tomahawk Prospect to Hess in exchange for an overriding royalty interest (\"ORRI\") in the hydrocarbons produced under the terms of the leases. The parties refer to this portion of the Tomahawk Agreement as the \"First Assignment.\" Hess's plan for these leases was to drill enough exploratory wells to prove their value and then sell them to larger operators. Spring Creek's president, William Coleman, testified that, at the time of the Tomahawk transaction, he understood that Hess's intention was to \"drill [the area] up and then sell it.\" Aplt. App'x, Vol. XXIII, at 3759, 234:14-21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In another part of the Tomahawk Agreement, Spring Creek, Gold Coast and Hess executed the \"Area of Mutual Interest Agreement.\" That agreement (the \"AMI Agreement\") established the entire Tomahawk Prospect as an Area of Mutual Interest (\"AMI\") for a term of three years. In relevant part, the AMI Agreement states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   During the term of the AMI, only [Hess] may proceed to lease or otherwise acquire interests within the AMI. If, during the term of the AMI, [Hess] should acquire any oil and gas lease, leasehold interest or mineral interest, [Hess] shall offer such interest to Coachman in the following proportions, [Hess] (90%), Coachman (10%), pursuant to that certain Participation Agreement dated October 8, 2009, by and between [Hess] and Coachman.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9957744\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/637/903/#p910\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at Vol. II, 304, \u00a7 1. The agreement further provides that \"for any oil and gas lease acquired\" by Hess in the AMI during the three-year term, Spring Creek and Gold Coast would receive ORRIs in those newly acquired leases, in addition to the ORRIs Spring Creek and Gold Coast were already slated to receive under the existing leases transferred to Hess in the First Assignment.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Finally, the AMI Agreement contains two other clauses relevant to this dispute:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   4.\n   <em>\n    Covenant Running with the Land\n   </em>\n   . This AMI and all rights, covenants and conditions hereof shall be considered covenants running with the land and shall inure to and be binding upon the Parties hereto, and their respective successors and assigns.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   5.\n   <em>\n    Confidentiality\n   </em>\n   . The terms of this Agreement are confidential and no Party, nor any of its respective affiliates or representatives shall furnish this Agreement, or disclose any of its contents, to any third party.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 306.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Hess-Statoil Settlement Agreement\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Hess's foray into the Tomahawk Prospect did not go unnoticed. On January 15, 2010, Statoil sent a letter to Hess alleging that Hess had breached the Rough Rider Agreement by acquiring leases in the Rough Rider Prospect during the non-compete period. That letter led to a February 2010 settlement agreement (the \"Hess-Statoil Settlement Agreement\"), in which Hess sold most of its Tomahawk Prospect leases to Statoil at a discount. Hess further agreed that any leases it acquired in the Tomahawk Prospect in the next three months would be offered to Statoil at cost (the \"three-month tail\"). In connection with Statoil's due diligence in executing the Hess-Statoil Settlement Agreement, Hess disclosed to Statoil the terms of the\n   AMI Agreement and provided it with a copy. Statoil had no interest in inheriting Hess's obligations under the AMI Agreement. To that end, the Hess-Statoil Settlement Agreement states the assignment of leases from Hess to Statoil does \"not include ... the Area of Mutual Interest Agreement dated October 8, 2009, among [Hess] ..., Spring Creek ... and Gold Coast.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at Vol. XXXIV, 5760, \u00b6 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Neither Spring Creek nor Gold Coast was privy to the Hess-Statoil negotiations. After the agreement was finalized, however, Statoil publicly announced that it had acquired about 10,000 net acres in the Rough Rider Prospect. And on April 12, 2010, Hess and Statoil executed an Assignment, Bill of Sale and Conveyance (the \"Second Assignment\"), formally transferring the Tomahawk leasehold interests from Hess to Statoil. That conveyance was recorded four days later.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    3. The Parties' Dealings After the Hess-Statoil Settlement Agreement\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Pursuant to the AMI Agreement, Hess made three assignments to Spring Creek and Gold Coast of ORRIs in leases that Hess acquired in the Tomahawk Prospect. The first, completed in April 2010, included leases acquired through March 24, 2010. The second, sent to Plaintiffs in June 2010, included nine leases acquired through March 11, 2010. The third, sent to Plaintiffs in November 2010, only included leases acquired in 2009. All three assignments referenced \"Brigham Leases,\" a reference to Statoil's predecessor, in the footer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   After the three-month tail in the Hess-Statoil Settlement Agreement expired, Hess notified its lease brokers to resume the hunt for leasing opportunities in the Tomahawk Prospect. Hess was presented at least one opportunity to acquire a lease in the Tomahawk Prospect, but declined to follow through because the lease was relatively small and Hess's strategy was to acquire acreage in larger quantities. Statoil, meanwhile, acquired many additional leases in the Tomahawk Prospect during this time, dozens of which were publicly recorded throughout 2010.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Although it is not clear exactly when Plaintiffs learned of the Hess-Statoil transaction, on September 13, 2010, Mark McPherson, Gold Coast's president, sent an email stating, \"We sold Tomahawk to Randy, who flipped to [Hess] until [Statoil] came to [Hess] and claimed [Hess] violated an agreement and [Statoil] got to buy [the Tomahawk Prospect leases] from [Hess].\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at Vol. XXVII, 4764. At his deposition, Mr. McPherson was asked how he knew that Statoil purchased the Tomahawk Prospect leases from Hess. His answer: \"I think Bill [Coleman, Spring Creek's president] told me.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at Vol. XXIV, 3990, 125:13-125:18. That answer is consistent with the testimony of Gold Coast's Rule 30(b)(6) deponent, Amy Pfannenstein. According to Ms. Pfannenstein, Gold Coast knew about the Hess-Statoil Settlement Agreement in September 2010, and Gold Coast learned about the agreement from Spring Creek.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at Vol. XXVII, 4672-73, 125:19-126:17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   This litigation began on December 13, 2013, when Spring Creek brought suit against Hess and Statoil in Colorado state court. The original complaint identified six claims for relief:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   1. Breach of Contract (against Hess)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   2. Breach of Contract (against Statoil)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   3. Breach of the Implied Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing (against Hess)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   4. Tortious Interference with Contract (against Statoil)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   5. Fraudulent Concealment (against Hess and Statoil)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   6. Civil Conspiracy (against Hess and Statoil)\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Spring Creek attached three exhibits to its original complaint:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   1. The First Assignment (part of the October 8, 2009, Tomahawk Agreement, by which Spring Creek and Gold Coast sold Tomahawk leases to Hess)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   2. The AMI Agreement (also part of the Tomahawk Agreement, by which Spring Creek, Gold Coast, and Hess identified the Tomahawk area as one of mutual interest)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   3. The Second Assignment (part of the Hess-Statoil Settlement, by which Hess assigned its Tomahawk leases to Statoil)\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   On January 17, 2014, Statoil removed Spring Creek's suit to the United States District Court for the District of Colorado. Hess and Statoil then separately moved to dismiss the complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The district court granted in part and denied in part each motion.\n   <em>\n    Spring Creek Expl. &amp; Prod. Co., LLC v. Hess Bakken Inv. II, LLC\n   </em>\n   , No. 14-CV-00134-PAB-KMT,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%204400764\">\n    2014 WL 4400764\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *14 (D. Colo. Sept. 5, 2014) (\"\n   <em>\n    Spring Creek I\n   </em>\n   \"). In particular, the district court dismissed with prejudice Spring Creek's third, fourth, fifth, and sixth claims for relief.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%204400764\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   That left just the breach of contract claims, but even those did not escape unscathed. As to Hess, the district court dismissed Spring Creek's breach of contract claim to the extent it alleged Hess failed to disclose leases acquired after April 2010 and failed to acquire new leases in the AMI.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *4-5. As to Statoil, the district court dismissed Spring Creek's breach of contract claim to the extent it alleged Statoil failed to disclose all leases acquired by Statoil in the AMI.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *11. The district court then explained what was left of Spring Creek's suit:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   \u2022 \"Plaintiff may proceed with [its] first claim for relief based on Hess Bakken's alleged breach of the confidentiality provision and failure to honor royalty interests in existing leases.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   \u2022 \"Plaintiff may proceed with its second claim for relief based on Statoil's alleged failure to assign override interests in new leases to Spring Creek and failure to honor royalty interests in existing leases.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *14. Put differently, Spring Creek had two surviving claims against Hess: (1) that Hess breached the AMI Agreement's confidentiality provision by disclosing its terms to Statoil without Spring Creek's consent, and (2) that Hess breached the AMI Agreement by not paying ORRIs on the \"Existing Leases,\" which the original complaint defines as those leases sold to Hess in the First Assignment, plus leases acquired by Hess in the AMI through November 2010. And Spring Creek had two surviving claims against Statoil: (1) that Statoil failed to pay ORRIs on those same Existing Leases, and (2) that Statoil failed to pay ORRIs on the \"New Leases,\" which the original complaint defines as those oil and gas leasehold interests acquired by Statoil within the Tomahawk Prospect after Statoil entered into the Hess-Statoil Settlement Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Spring Creek promptly moved for reconsideration of the district court's order. The district court denied that motion.\n   <em>\n    Spring Creek Expl. &amp; Prod. Co., LLC v. Hess Bakken Inv. II, LLC\n   </em>\n   , No. 14-CV-00134-PAB-KMT,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%203542699\">\n    2015 WL 3542699\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3 (D. Colo. June 5, 2015) (\"\n   <em>\n    Spring Creek II\n   </em>\n   \"). While the reconsideration motion was pending, Gold Coast moved to intervene as an additional plaintiff. The district court granted Gold Coast's motion. On April 28,\n   2015, Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint, which added Gold Coast as a plaintiff but was otherwise identical to the original complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Meanwhile, the case proceeded through discovery. In May 2015, Hess moved for partial summary judgment on Plaintiffs' request for reliance damages. The district court granted that motion in full.\n   <em>\n    Spring Creek Expl. &amp; Prod. Co., LLC v. Hess Bakken Inv. II, LLC\n   </em>\n   , No. 14-CV-00134-PAB-KMT,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%201170105\">\n    2016 WL 1170105\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *6 (D. Colo. Mar. 24, 2016) (\"\n   <em>\n    Spring Creek III\n   </em>\n   \").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Hess and Statoil thereafter separately moved for summary judgment. In September 2016, the district court granted in part and denied in part both motions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Spring Creek Expl. &amp; Prod. Co., LLC v.

Colo. Sept. 8, 2016) (\"\n   <em>\n    Spring Creek IV\n   </em>\n   \"). As to Hess, the district court held Plaintiffs' claims for breach of the AMI Agreement's confidentiality provision were time-barred.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *14. As to Statoil, the district court held that Statoil was not an assignee of the AMI Agreement; it partially granted Statoil's motion for summary judgment on that basis.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *10-11. As to both Hess and Statoil, the district court denied their motions for summary judgment on Plaintiffs' breach of contract claims for underpayment of royalties on the Existing Leases.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *11, 15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Rather than proceed to trial on the underpayment-of-royalties claims, the parties jointly moved to dismiss the remaining claims without prejudice, as all preferred to arbitrate them instead. Indeed, the parties executed an Agreement to Arbitrate dated December 7, 2016. On December 15, the district court granted in part the stipulated motion to dismiss the Existing Leases claims.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   It entered final judgment on December 16 and an amended final judgment on December 21, 2016. This appeal timely followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Contemporaneous with the parties' briefing in this court, the Existing Lease claims were resolved in arbitration. In October 2017, an arbitrator dismissed with prejudice Spring Creek's Existing Lease claims against both Hess and Statoil. And in November 2017, upon stipulation of the parties, the same arbitrator awarded Gold Coast $82,924.96 from Statoil and dismissed Gold Coast's claims against Hess, with prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Plaintiffs are wrong. The AMI Agreement plainly does not require Hess to acquire new leases. To recap, the AMI Agreement provides: \"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     If,\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   during the term of the AMI, [Hess] should acquire any oil and gas lease, leasehold interest or mineral interest....\" Aplt. App'x, Vol. I, at 304, \u00a7 1 (emphasis added). Looking to that same provision, the district court held that it \"is inconsistent with any obligation for Hess to acquire new leases.\"\n   <em>\n    Spring Creek I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%204400764\">\n    2014 WL 4400764\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5. We agree with the district court. Plaintiffs' attempts to manufacture ambiguity are unavailing. They argue that the AMI Agreement \"would be unambiguous ... if it said '[Hess] does\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   have to acquire leases.' It does not.\" Aplt. Br. at 30 (emphasis in original). Plaintiffs' strawman does not impress, for there are lots of requirements one could imagine imposing on Hess that the AMI Agreement does not explicitly disclaim. For instance, the AMI Agreement is silent as to whether Hess's payments must be made in rubles (or any other particular currency). But that silence is not an ambiguity. Nor would it support a plausible claim that Hess breached the contract by sending payment in U.S. dollars. These sorts of imagined breaches, detached from any contractual duty, are appropriately dismissed at the pleadings stage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   In their attempt to undermine the plain meaning of the \"If\" provision, Plaintiffs point to two other portions of the AMI Agreement: a recital and a broker provision. The recital provides that \"the Parties\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     desire\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   to establish an area of mutual interest covering the Tomahawk Prospect and provide for the acquisition of interests by [Hess].\" Aplt. App'x, Vol. I, at 304 (emphasis added). As a recital, it is \"not strictly any part of the contract,\"\n   <em>\n    Las Animas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2817535\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/colo/100/508/\">\n    68 P.2d at 566\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , but, even if it were, it would not create an obligation to acquire new leases. The recital's language is aspirational; by its terms it imposes no obligations on anyone. The broker provision is similarly permissive. It states that Hess \"shall endeavor to retain Diamond Resources as a lease broker to acquire interests within the AMI.\" Aplt. App'x, Vol. I, at 305, \u00a7 3. Reading the broker provision in light of the \"If\" provision, it is clearly not obliging Hess to acquire new leases. It is merely, in Hess's words, \"a non-binding broker preference provision\" that \"says nothing about\n   [Hess] being required to acquire leases, much less how many leases it had to acquire.\" Hess Aplee. Br. at 25.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Plaintiffs' position is curious for another reason: In the proceedings below, Plaintiffs acknowledged \"that Hess cannot guarantee that it will be able to actually acquire new leases.\" Aplt. App'x, Vol. I, at 381. They repeat that observation in their opening brief on appeal, conceding \"that neither party can guarantee that a mineral owner will sign a lease.\" Aplt. Br. at 29. That reality, which Plaintiffs acknowledge, undermines their argument that the contract can plausibly be read to bind Hess to an obligation that it could not guarantee it would be able to meet.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Finally, we conclude that Plaintiffs are not deprived of the benefit of the bargain under our interpretation of the AMI Agreement. Under the AMI Agreement, to whatever extent Hess acquires additional leases, Plaintiffs would benefit, in the form of additional ORRIs, \"from the resources [Hess] invested in acquiring new leases, if any, without any effort on Plaintiffs' part, and receive those ORRIs 'free and clear of any burdens placed thereon by [Hess].' \" Hess Aplee. Br. at 22 (quoting Aplt. App'x, Vol. I, at 81-82, \u00a7 1). And Spring Creek concedes that \"Hess\n   <em>\n    did\n   </em>\n   acquire new leasehold interests within the Tomahawk Prospect and assigned Spring Creek its Override Interests pursuant to the terms of the Agreement.\" Aplt. App'x, Vol. I, at 59, Compl. \u00b6 17 (emphasis added). Plaintiffs' grievance, therefore, is merely that Hess did not acquire enough new leases for long enough into the three-year AMI term. But that is not a grievance we can cure. Even had Hess acquired no new leases, Plaintiffs still would have received the benefit of their bargain, both because it received valuable consideration for the leases it sold to Hess, including ORRIs in those Existing Leases, and because Hess was not obliged to acquire any new leases at all.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   b.\n   <em>\n    Breach of the Implied Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Next, Plaintiffs argue that they stated a plausible claim that Hess breached the covenant of good faith and fair dealing. They contend that Hess breached the implied covenant when it agreed to the Hess-Statoil Settlement Agreement four months into the three-year AMI term and stopped all efforts to acquire leases in the AMI. The district court dismissed this claim as derivative of the breach-of-contract claim discussed\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Spring Creek I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%204400764\">\n    2014 WL 4400764\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *7-8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   \"Colorado, like the majority of jurisdictions, recognizes that every contract contains an implied duty of good faith and fair dealing.\"\n   <em>\n    Amoco Oil Co. v.

Plaintiffs may have had a claim for the breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing if, for example, the AMI Agreement required Hess to acquire new leases in the AMI, without specifying the quantity of new leases. But the AMI Agreement did not \"defer\" a decision as to the scope of Hess's requirement to acquire new leases; there was no requirement at all.

The reconsideration motion thus attached eight additional contracts that, together with the AMI Agreement and the First Assignment, constitute the ten-part Tomahawk Agreement. Spring Creek did not argue that the contracts were newly discovered. Instead, Spring Creek acknowledged it \"regrettably may not have been clear in its Complaint\" and \"apologize[d] for the confusion.\" Aplt. App'x, Vol. I, at 259-60. Spring Creek's apology notwithstanding, the district court declined to consider the additional contracts.

It further noted that reconsideration motions \"are generally an inappropriate vehicle to advance 'new arguments, or supporting facts which were available at the time of the original motion.' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%203542699\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Servants of the Paraclete\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11476121\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/204/1005/#p1011\">\n    204 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1012 ). Because the contracts were available to Spring Creek when it filed its complaint and when it filed its briefs in opposition to the motions to dismiss, the district court found that Spring Creek was entitled to no relief.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *2-3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   On appeal, Plaintiffs argue the district court applied the wrong legal standard. They contend the district court erroneously relied on Rule 60(b)(2), which provides that \"the court may relieve a party\" from a final judgment where there is\n   \"newly discovered evidence that, with reasonable diligence, could not have been discovered in time to move for a new trial under Rule 59(b).\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(2). Plaintiffs are mistaken. First, the district court did not rely on Rule 60(b)(2) in denying reconsideration. It never even cited that rule. Instead, it invoked its \"plenary power to revisit and amend interlocutory orders as justice requires.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Spring Creek II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%203542699\">\n    2015 WL 3542699\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2 (\"Regardless of the analysis applied, the basic assessment tends to be the same: courts consider whether new evidence\n   <em>\n    or legal authority\n   </em>\n   has emerged\n   <em>\n    or whether the prior ruling was clearly in error\n   </em>\n   .\" (emphasis added) ). Second, Rule 60(b) is, by its terms, permissive. It allows a district court to grant relief where it has been presented newly discovered evidence, Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(2), but it does not prohibit a district court from granting relief in the absence of newly discovered evidence,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(1), (6) (allowing the district court discretion to grant relief \"[o]n motion and just terms\" because of \"excusable neglect\" or \"any other reason that justifies relief\"). As a result, Plaintiffs cannot show that they were prejudiced by application of a rule that vested the court with the discretion to grant the relief that was sought. Third, even if the district court had errantly relied on Rule 60(b), Plaintiffs would be barred under our invited error doctrine from arguing against that standard, given that they themselves proposed it to the district court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    John Zink Co. v.

All of them rely on references to additional Tomahawk Agreement contracts executed contemporaneously with the First Assignment and AMI Agreement. Spring Creek had these additional documents in its possession all along, but chose not to attach them to its complaint or its briefs in opposition to the motions to dismiss. The district court was not \"arbitrary, capricious, whimsical, or manifestly unreasonable\" in refusing to consider them for the first time after it had already ruled.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wright\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9501478\" index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/259/1226/#p1235\">\n    259 F.3d at 1236\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Plaintiffs' preferred damages theory is that, had they rescinded the AMI Agreement at the time of Hess's purported breach, they would have entered into significantly more lucrative agreements in the Tomahawk Prospect. Thus, they believe they should be entitled to the value of the lost opportunity to acquire leases in the AMI area from the date of Hess's breach until the expiration of the AMI Agreement. The stakes are high: Plaintiffs estimated their reliance damages totaled between $182 million and $403 million, with an expected value of $271 million. By contrast, their expectation damages-their \"benefit of the bargain\" damages, in other words-totaled between $24.2 million and $59.3 million, with an expected value of $38.9 million. The parties and the district court all agree that Colorado law controls-but, at least in the district court, \"[t]he parties have not identified any Colorado case addressing the circumstances that justify recovery of reliance damages.\"\n   <em>\n    Spring Creek III\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%201170105\">\n    2016 WL 1170105\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4. \"Without a guiding opinion from Colorado,\" the district court predicted that \"the Colorado Supreme Court would likely limit the availability of reliance damages to circumstances where expectation damages are uncertain or impossible\n   to calculate.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%201170105\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   For the reasons that follow, the district court's holding is sound.

But even if, strictly speaking,\n   <em>\n    Golden\n   </em>\n   's AMI analysis is not integral to the holding in that case or binding on North Dakota courts, it is still our best evidence of how the North Dakota Supreme Court would treat the AMI Covenants were it deciding this case.

But North Dakota law treats AMI covenants as it would any other covenant, as Plaintiffs themselves acknowledge.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Aplt.

It is true that AMI covenants run with the land under Texas law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Westland Oil Dev. Corp. v. Gulf Oil Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9957744\" index=\"151\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/637/903/#p910\">\n    637 S.W.2d 903\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 910-11 (Tex. 1982). Yet Plaintiffs' protest, that \"[w]ith no analysis, the District Court rejected\n   <em>\n    Westland\n   </em>\n   and did not address ... other cases\" decided by courts in Texas and Colorado, is misplaced. Aplt. Br. at 50-51. The district court focused its attention on North Dakota law, as was proper. Finding clear guidance from cases decided by the North Dakota Supreme Court, the district court quite reasonably declined to survey the law in other jurisdictions. The district court correctly concluded that the covenants at issue in this case do not run with the land under North Dakota law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Did Statoil accept assignment of the AMI Agreement?\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   Next, Plaintiffs argue that, even if the AMI Covenants do not run with the land, Statoil is nevertheless subject to them because it expressly assumed Hess's obligations under the AMI Agreement. Plaintiffs' argument is not that Statoil accepted assignment of the AMI Agreement in the Hess-Statoil Settlement Agreement. It clearly did not.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Aplt. App'x, Vol. XXXII, at 5760, \u00b6 2 (the Hess-Statoil Settlement Agreement, stating that it does \"not include ... the Area of Mutual Interest Agreement\"). Plaintiffs argue instead that Statoil expressly assumed Hess's obligations under the AMI Agreement when Hess and Statoil executed the Second Assignment, a few weeks after memorializing the Hess-Statoil Settlement Agreement. This would be a curious course of events, requiring us to conclude that Statoil expressly disclaimed any obligations under the AMI Agreement in the Hess-Statoil Settlement Agreement, only to expressly assume those same obligations a few weeks later, in the very assignment of leases the Settlement Agreement authorized. The Second Assignment does no such thing. It does not even mention the AMI Agreement. And that omission creates a problem for Plaintiffs, for contracts generally do not assign other contracts (let alone \"expressly\") without mentioning the earlier contract by name. Plaintiffs purport to avoid that problem by reference to two different provisions in the Second Assignment. We will next address each provision in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   a.\n   <em>\n    Paragraph A of the Second Assignment\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   Plaintiffs' first argument is directed at the following provision of the Second Assignment:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-158\">\n   ... [Hess] ... assigns ... unto [Statoil] all of [Hess]'s right, title and interest ... in and to ... [the Tomahawk Prospect leases], including all leasehold estates, royalty interests, overriding royalty interests, net profits interests, and similar interests ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9957744\" index=\"152\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/637/903/#p910\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at Vol. X, 1835, \u00b6 A. On its face, this provision says nothing about the AMI Agreement. So Plaintiffs attempt to pair it with something that does. Shortly before the Second Assignment was executed, Hess made the first of three royalties payments that it would make to Spring Creek and Gold Coast. These payments were memorialized in an assignment that did reference the AMI Agreement. In particular, the royalties assignment provided that the assignment of royalties \"is made subject to\" the AMI Agreement.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9957744\" index=\"153\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/637/903/#p910\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at Vol. XI, 1865, \u00b6 B. Plaintiffs argue that when Hess assigned to Statoil all \"right, title and interest\" in the leases on which Plaintiffs held ORRIs, including \"all ... overriding royalty interests,\" Statoil became obligated to honor the terms of the ORRIs that Hess had previously assigned to Plaintiffs. And because the ORRI assignment stated that it was \"made subject to\" the AMI Agreement, Statoil expressly assumed the AMI Agreement. We are unconvinced.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   Hess's assignment of ORRIs states that \"the AMI contain[s] certain representations, warranties and agreements between\" Plaintiffs and Hess, \"some of which survive the delivery of this Assignment, as provided for therein,\n   <em>\n    and shall not be merged into this Assignment\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9957744\" index=\"154\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/637/903/#p910\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added).

On appeal, Plaintiffs argue that Statoil voluntarily accepted the benefits of the Tomahawk Agreement in three ways: (1) per the terms of the Second Assignment, Statoil accepted the benefits of the JOA, (2) Statoil purchased many leases in the AMI, and therefore accepted the benefits of Plaintiffs not competing for leases in the AMI, and (3) Statoil accepted Plaintiffs' confidential well, lease and land information from Hess. The first and third arguments are unavailing because they are unmoored from any benefits that would relate to being a party to the AMI Agreement, as opposed to other portions of the multifaceted Tomahawk Agreement.

Br. at 64 (citation omitted).\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   In Hess's view, Plaintiffs' first theory fails because undisputed evidence establishes that Hess would not have acquired additional leases in the Tomahawk Prospect, and thus Plaintiffs were not deprived of additional ORRIs. The second and third theories, meanwhile, are both predicated on Statoil agreeing to be bound by the AMI Agreement without seeing it first. Those theories fail, according to Hess, because the unrebutted evidence establishes that Statoil was not willing to be bound by the AMI Agreement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Aplt. App'x, Vol. XXII, at 3624-25, 206:4-207:5 (Statoil \"would not\" and \"could not\" acquire the Tomahawk Prospect leases without knowing the terms of the AMI Agreement).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-177\">\n   In their reply brief, Plaintiffs pursued only the first theory of harm.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   To place that argument in context, Plaintiffs admit that Statoil was entitled to review the contents of the AMI Agreement once it acquired the Existing Leases from Hess. Thus, any damage must have occurred, if at all, during the period between Statoil's review of the AMI Agreement during its due diligence, and the date of the Second Assignment, whereby the Existing Leases were transferred to Statoil.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-178\">\n   According to Plaintiffs, Hess's breach of the confidentiality provision caused them damages because \"Statoil would not have done the [Hess-Statoil Settlement Agreement] otherwise.\" Aplt. Reply Br. at 39 n.24. They further argued that \"Hess's claim that there were [not] many leases left to acquire ... is obviously contradicted by the fact [that Statoil] acquired over 2500 acres of new leases after [Hess]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-179\">\n   stopped acquiring new leases.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10376577\" index=\"175\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/841/1053/#p1058\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   It is difficult for us to evaluate this further argument, because it is unaccompanied by any citation to the voluminous record. We cannot discern, for instance, whether Statoil's acquisition of new leases actually occurred within the Tomahawk Prospect, or elsewhere within the much larger Rough Rider Prospect, in which case Statoil's acquisitions are of little relevance. Nor are we convinced that Statoil's acquisition of additional leases in the Tomahawk Prospect would be probative of whether\n   <em>\n    Hess\n   </em>\n   would have acquired additional leases. Indeed, Plaintiffs have not referred us to any record evidence contradicting Hess's proffered evidence that (1) Hess did not have a leasing budget or long-term lease acquisition goals for the Tomahawk Prospect, (2) Hess did not believe there were many leases left to acquire, and (3) even after settling with Statoil, Hess felt free to lease in the Tomahawk Prospect, but declined to act on the opportunities presented for strategic reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-180\">\n   On the record before us, summary judgment for Hess is proper because Plaintiffs have not presented a genuine dispute of material fact regarding any damages caused by Hess's purported breach of the AMI Agreement's confidentiality provision. And without proffering evidence in support of one of the elements of their breach of contract claims, Plaintiffs' claims fail as a matter of law, entitling Hess to summary judgment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Savant Homes, Inc. v.
