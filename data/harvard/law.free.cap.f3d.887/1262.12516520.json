In 2014, the Federal Aviation Administration clarified that it interpreted \u00a7 47133 's revenue-use restriction to apply to all state and local governments, regardless of whether they own or operate an airport. Notwithstanding \u00a7 47133 's prohibition, Clayton County imposes a tax on aviation fuel sold at Hartsfield-Jackson Airport and shares the revenues with the cities within Clayton County-College Park, Forest Park, Jonesboro, Lake City, Lovejoy, Morrow, and Riverdale. These entities spend those tax revenues on local municipal projects unrelated to aviation. The Clayton County Public School system also levies a sales tax on aviation fuel sold at Hartsfield-Jackson and spends the proceeds on education. Although Hartsfield-Jackson is partially located in Clayton County, none of these taxing entities-Clayton County, the cities within Clayton County, or Clayton County Public Schools (collectively \"Petitioners\")-owns or operates the airport.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In 2015, Petitioners submitted a plan to the FAA describing how they intended to come into compliance with the FAA's recently clarified interpretation of \u00a7 47133. In 2016, Petitioners backtracked from the conciliatory stance they took in 2015 and instead submitted an \"Amendment\" challenging the FAA's position that Petitioners could not legally spend tax revenue from\n   aviation fuel on local projects unrelated to aviation. The FAA responded in a letter, restating the position it took in its 2014 policy clarification and expressing concern that Petitioners might not be in compliance. The FAA asked Petitioners to contact the FAA to discuss potential offsets and other methods for Petitioners to achieve compliance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Petitioners filed this lawsuit challenging the FAA's interpretation of \u00a7 47133 as set forth in the FAA's 2016 letter. We conclude, however, that we lack jurisdiction to consider the merits of Petitioners' arguments because the FAA's letter does not constitute final agency action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

Reg. 69789\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 69793 (2013) (proposing to clarify that \"[t]he Federal limits on use of aviation fuel tax proceeds apply at an airport that is the subject of Federal assistance ... regardless of the state or local jurisdiction imposing the tax\"). The FAA received comments on its proposed clarification, including a comment from the Georgia Departments of Revenue and Transportation. Georgia \"disagree[d]\" with the FAA's interpretation that \"any entity that imposes or administers a tax on aviation fuel may also be sanctioned even though it is neither an airport sponsor nor the recipient of federal assistance.\" And Georgia expressed concern about how the FAA's interpretation would impact Hartsfield-Jackson Airport and Clayton County specifically. Although Hartsfield-Jackson is partially within Clayton County and Clayton County taxes aviation fuel sales that occur there, Clayton County is not the airport sponsor because it neither owns nor operates Hartsfield-Jackson. So Georgia was concerned that \"under the FAA's new view .... Clayton County could ... be sanctioned even though it is not the sponsor of Hartsfield-Jackson and is not the recipient\n   of federal assistance for Hartsfield-Jackson.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   After considering this and other comments, the FAA issued an order in 2014 codifying its proposed clarification. The FAA's amended policy states that \u00a7 47133 applies \"to any tax imposed on aviation fuel by either a State government or a local government taxing authority whether or not acting as a sponsor or airport owner or operator.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=79%20Fed.%20Reg.%2066282\">\n    79 Fed.

Because the FAA acknowledged that its earlier position on \u00a7 47133 's applicability to non-sponsors may have been unclear, the FAA gave state and local governments three years to come into compliance and set a compliance deadline for December 8, 2017.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=79%20Fed.%20Reg.%2066282\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=79%20Fed.%20Reg.%2066282\">\n    at 66286\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

And since 1997, Clayton County Public Schools has levied its own tax on such sales. The revenues from these taxes are spent on local municipal and school projects unrelated to aviation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In 2015, after the FAA clarified that it interpreted \u00a7 47133 to apply to non-sponsors' aviation fuel tax revenues, Petitioners submitted an action plan to the FAA describing their tax scheme and plan to comply with \u00a7 47133. Petitioners described the difficulty, practically and legally, of updating their tax scheme to exclude revenues from sales taxes on aviation fuel sold at Hartsfield-Jackson. As an alternative, they proposed to offset their aviation fuel tax revenues with the value of other taxes Petitioners do not impose on Hartsfield-Jackson (such as property taxes) and in-kind services provided to the airport (such as police and municipal court services).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   A year later, Petitioners sent a letter to the FAA that Petitioners labeled as an \"Amendment\" to their plan. The letter did not change the proposed action plan, but instead argued that the FAA's interpretation that \u00a7 47133 applied to non-sponsor local governments was erroneous and unlawful.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The FAA responded in a letter (the \"Letter\") two months later on November 17, 2016. It is this Letter that Petitioners contend constitutes final agency action. In the Letter, the FAA states that it \"disagrees\" with Petitioners' interpretation of \u00a7 47133 and \"believe[s] federal law prohibits all state and local governments from diverting aviation fuel tax revenues for any non-aviation related purpose.\" And the FAA observes that Petitioners' use of aviation fuel tax revenues \"to support a variety of public services, including public education and infrastructure, is the use of the tax to fund 'unrelated municipal services and activities ...' contrary to the express purpose of the federal ban on the diversion of aviation fuel tax revenue.\" The FAA also states that it is \"concerned that [Petitioners] will not be in compliance with the aviation fuel tax revenue use requirements by December 8, 2017.\" To remedy this, the FAA advises Petitioners that the agency is\n   \"available to discuss with [them] in more detail permissible offsets of diversions of aviation fuels tax revenues, and other potential means to achieve compliance.\" Finally, the FAA states that the Letter \"represents the present view of the FAA's Office of Chief Counsel based on the facts presented\" by Petitioners, \"does not constrain future FAA action or opinion,\" and is only an \"advisory response\"-not \"final agency action.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In December 2016, after receiving a letter from Georgia congressman David Scott about \u00a7 47133 's applicability to Petitioners, the FAA sent a letter to Congressman Scott confirming that it interpreted \u00a7 47133 to apply to all state and local governments, and that Petitioners should pursue other offsets or legislative remedies to comply with \u00a7 47133.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Petitioners filed this lawsuit under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2046110\">\n    49 U.S.C. \u00a7 46110\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) challenging the FAA's interpretation of \u00a7 47133 set forth in the Letter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     DISCUSSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   To be judicially reviewable under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2046110\">\n    49 U.S.C. \u00a7 46110\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), an FAA order must be final.\n   <em>\n    Green v.

They contend that the Letter (1) sets forth a new, binding interpretation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2047133\">\n    49 U.S.C. \u00a7 47133\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and (2) reflects that the FAA has decided that Petitioners' tax scheme violates \u00a7 47133 and that the FAA will enforce its interpretation of \u00a7 47133 against Petitioners. Neither position is persuasive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Petitioners first argue that the Letter constitutes final agency action because it sets forth a new interpretation of \u00a7 47133 : that is, it applies to non-sponsors like Petitioners. They contend that the FAA's earlier 2014 policy clarification did not define \"non-sponsor,\" established only that \u00a7 47133 applied to \"certain\" non-sponsors, and generally did not indicate that Petitioners would be affected.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Whether the Letter established a new interpretation or merely restated the FAA's earlier interpretation matters because, to be final, the challenged agency action \"must be one by which rights or obligations have been determined, or from which legal consequences will flow.\"\n   <em>\n    Hawkes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12597316\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/1807/#p1813\">\n    136 S.Ct. at 1813\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quotation marks omitted). An agency's restatement of an already-existing policy or interpretation does not, on its own, determine any rights or obligations and imposes no\n   legal consequences. Then-Judge John Roberts best explained this in a case where the D.C. Circuit considered facts substantially similar to those here: a regulated party presented its interpretation of the EPA's regulations, and the EPA stated in a response letter that it disagreed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Indep.

Reg. at 66285\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , does not muddy its meaning. The phrase is most naturally read as a reference to \u00a7 47133 's grandfather clause.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2047133\">\n    49 U.S.C. \u00a7 47133\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) (grandfathering in \"taxes in effect on December 30, 1987\"). In the background section summarizing the FAA's clarification, the FAA's order notes that \u00a7 47133 's revenue-use requirement applies to \"certain State and local government taxes on aviation fuel,\" namely \"proceeds from both new taxes and to existing taxes that do not qualify for grandfathering from revenue use requirements.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=79%20Fed.%20Reg.%2066282\">\n    79 Fed. Reg. at 66283\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . When read in context, the reference to \"certain\" non-sponsors does not suggest that there was ambiguity in the FAA's interpretation of \u00a7 47133 as to whether it applied to non-sponsors, including Petitioners.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   In fact, before filing this lawsuit, Petitioners and others had acknowledged that the FAA's policy clarification interpreted \u00a7 47133 to apply to non-sponsors, including Petitioners. Specifically, before the FAA issued its clarification, the Georgia Departments of Transportation and Revenue filed a comment recognizing that \"under the FAA's new view .... Clayton County could ... be sanctioned even though it is not the sponsor of Hartsfield-Jackson and is not the recipient of federal assistance for Hartsfield-Jackson.\" And, after the clarification was issued, Petitioners themselves acknowledged that the FAA interpreted \u00a7 47133 to apply to non-sponsor local governments, including them. Petitioners' action plan recognized that \"[t]he policy amendment requires that State and local taxes on aviation fuel be subject to the airport revenue use restrictions.\" And Petitioners explained that they submitted an action plan because they \"collect local taxes on aviation fuel that ... per the FAA Policy, are required to be transitioned to full compliance.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Thus, the FAA's Letter merely restates its interpretation of \u00a7 47133 that was established two years earlier in its policy clarification. In the Letter, the FAA \"disagree[s] with [Petitioners'] contention that the federal prohibition on the diversion of aviation fuel tax revenue for non-aviation purposes only applies to state or local governments who received federal airport improvement grants or are an airport sponsor.\" Instead, the FAA states that it \"believe[s] federal law prohibits all state and local governments from diverting aviation fuel tax revenues for any non-aviation related purpose.\" The Letter also recognizes that the FAA's interpretation was originally established in its 2014 policy clarification. Because the Letter only restates that earlier interpretation, the Letter does not carry any legal consequences for Petitioners and cannot be final in this regard. Any legal consequences of the FAA's interpretation of \u00a7 47133 flow from the 2014 policy clarification-not the Letter sent two years later.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Second, Petitioners contend that the Letter is final because it determines that the FAA will enforce \u00a7 47133 against Petitioners. Hence, Petitioners claim, they risk significant civil penalties if they fail to follow the Letter. We have recognized, however, that an agency's observation that a party's practices may potentially violate the law does not necessarily mark the culmination of the agency's decisionmaking process so as to determine a party's legal rights or obligations. For example, we addressed an \"interim response\" from the EPA that expressed \"significant concerns about the adequacy\" of Alabama's pollutant discharge permitting program in\n   <em>\n    Riverkeeper\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4358948\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/806/1079/#p1083\">\n    806 F.3d at 1080\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The EPA's letter stated that the EPA would \"work with [Alabama] and give [Alabama] an opportunity\n   to address [the EPA's] concerns\" before the EPA determined whether or not to withdraw Alabama's authority to administer the program.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4358948\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/806/1079/#p1083\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   We held that the EPA's letter was not final agency action because the EPA had not \"come to a decision on whether to commence program withdrawal proceedings,\" and the letter itself carried no legal consequences as the EPA \"ha[d] not determined, after a public hearing, that Alabama ha[d] failed to properly administer\" the program as required for withdrawal under federal law.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4358948\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/806/1079/#p1083\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4358948\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/806/1079/#p1083\">\n    at 1082-83\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <em>\n    Riverkeeper\n   </em>\n   governs here, and we hold that the Letter is not final agency action in the sense that it determines that Petitioners have violated the law or threatens enforcement. The Letter reveals that the FAA has not conclusively determined that Petitioners are in violation of \u00a7 47133. It states that the FAA is \"concerned that [Petitioners] will not be in compliance with the aviation fuel tax revenue use requirements by December 8, 2017.\" And it advises Petitioners that the FAA is \"available to discuss with [them] in more detail permissible offsets of diversions of aviation fuels tax revenues, and other potential means to achieve compliance.\" The Letter concludes by stating that it \"represents the present view of the FAA,\" \"does not constrain future FAA action or opinion,\" and is only an \"advisory response\" that \"does not constitute a final agency action.\" And just as the EPA's interim response in\n   <em>\n    Riverkeeper\n   </em>\n   could not create legal consequences unless the EPA followed the statutory requirements for withdrawal, the Letter by itself does not determine Petitioners' rights or obligations. It is \"beyond any doubt that further administrative action\" is required before Petitioners face actual consequences.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nat'l Parks Conservation Ass'n v. Norton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2160908\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/324/1229/#p1238\">\n    324 F.3d 1229\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1238 (11th Cir. 2003). Indeed, at oral argument, Petitioners acknowledged both that the Letter does not direct Petitioners to do anything except follow the FAA's earlier policy clarification and that the Letter does not threaten enforcement. Thus, it is not a final agency action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   This conclusion is consistent with the pragmatic concerns at play here, which focus \"on whether judicial review at th[is] time will disrupt the administrative process.\"\n   <em>\n    Riverkeeper\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4358948\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/806/1079/#p1083\">\n    806 F.3d at 1083\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted). First, judicial review of the Letter would interfere with the agencies' ability to consult with and advise regulated parties about how to comply with federal law and regulations. The Letter only sets forth Petitioners' pre-existing obligation to comply with the FAA's interpretation of \u00a7 47133. If a court intervened now, it might mean that regulated parties could bring lawsuits whenever an agency advises a party of its already-existing obligations. Such a result would discourage agencies from offering advisory guidance which in turn would harm regulated parties who appreciate and rely on such guidance. This prospect would \"quickly muzzle any informal communications between agencies and their regulated communities-communications that are vital to the smooth operation of both government and business.\"\n   <em>\n    Indep. Equip. Dealers\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9232512,3429379\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/372/420/\">\n    372 F.3d at 428\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Second, judicial intervention at this stage would interfere with agencies' discretionary authority over whether to bring enforcement actions. The Letter makes clear that Petitioners and the FAA are (or at least were at the time) in ongoing discussions about Petitioners' compliance with \u00a7 47133. If a court intervened, it would force the agency to litigate over what may be a preliminary conclusion made without a full grasp of the relevant facts. This could \"well have a negative impact on the give and take between\" agencies and those they regulate.\n   <em>\n    Riverkeeper\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4358948\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/806/1079/#p1083\">\n    806 F.3d at 1083-84\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   In holding that we lack jurisdiction to consider Petitioners' challenge to a letter, we note that Petitioners have, and had, other avenues to challenge the FAA's interpretation of \u00a7 47133. For example, if the FAA brings an enforcement action in the future, Petitioners will be able to raise their claims then.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20703\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 703\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Except to the extent that prior, adequate, and exclusive opportunity for judicial review is provided by law, agency action is subject to judicial review in civil or criminal proceedings for judicial enforcement.\"). And Petitioners could have challenged the FAA's interpretation of \u00a7 47133 when the 2014 policy clarification was originally issued.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2046110\">\n    49 U.S.C. \u00a7 46110\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (allowing a party to challenge a final FAA order within sixty days after it is issued). It was Petitioners who chose not to challenge the 2014 policy clarification at a time when such a challenge would have been timely.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   In the end, Petitioners' lawsuit is both too late and too early. It comes too late to challenge the FAA's policy clarification issued in 2014, and it comes too early to challenge an FAA enforcement action that may never happen.
