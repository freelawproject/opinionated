After St. Joe's General Store in Perryville, Missouri, had closed, clerk Angela Corse worked to prepare the store for the next day. The back door was unlocked and propped opened for cleaning. As Corse faced away from that door, someone entered the store behind her, wrapped his arm around her, and pressed a gun to her back. The unknown male asked for money and pushed Corse toward the cash registers, where he made her pull cash from the drawer. Corse never saw the man's face but believed he was African American based on the appearance of his hand when he took the cash. The man then grabbed Corse's wallet off the counter and pushed Corse to the rear of the store. He shoved her aside and pointed a gun at her before running out the back door.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   As the man fled from the store, Corse saw a white Suburban driving slowly on the road parallel to the back of the store. The vehicle's brake lights illuminated, and the man went towards the Suburban. Once Corse realized where he was going, she shut and locked the door and immediately called 911. Corse reported that she had been robbed at gunpoint and that the suspect had left in a white Suburban driven by someone else. She also described the individual's clothing, race, and the color of the gun she had seen pointed at her-silver. The dispatcher immediately relayed this information to Perryville and Perry County law enforcement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Perry County Sheriff's Deputy Rusty Farrar responded to the call reporting an armed robbery at St. Joe's General Store. Farrar heard the description of a white Suburban and immediately headed towards the store. After only a couple of blocks, he noticed a white Suburban driving in the opposite direction in the oncoming lane. Farrar activated his lights and sirens and pursued. The Suburban pulled over, and Farrar called for backup. Two officers soon arrived. Peering into the vehicle,\n   the officers observed a woman's wallet behind the driver's seat. The officers identified Daniel as the driver of the Suburban. Darion Gipson was the passenger. Daniel initially argued with Farrar over the traffic stop, but he ultimately consented to a search of the vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The search revealed that the women's wallet behind the driver's seat was Corse's. Near the wallet, the officers found a hoodie similar to the one worn by the person who attacked Corse. Gipson had on no jacket or sweatshirt. The searching officer found a loaded black 9mm pistol in the space underneath the front seat cupholder. Gipson had $349 in cash in his pocket-the precise amount a later audit revealed was taken from the store's cash register. The officers never found a silver gun.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Daniel went to trial, and the jury convicted him of aiding and abetting the interference with commerce by robbery, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%202\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and 1951, and aiding and abetting the possession of a firearm in furtherance of a crime of violence, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%202\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and 924(c)(1)(A)(ii). On appeal, Daniel argues that the district court erroneously denied a pretrial motion to suppress evidence obtained in the traffic stop. He also challenges the sufficiency of the evidence as to both convictions. Finally, Daniel contends that the jury instructions were erroneous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   II.\n   <em>\n    Discussion\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Motion to Suppress\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   We first address the district court's denial of the motion to suppress. \"We review the denial of a motion to suppress\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   but the underlying factual determinations for clear error, giving due weight to inferences drawn by law enforcement officials.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Of course, this latter inference does not answer the necessary question: whether Daniel knew Gipson would not only conduct a robbery, but an\n   <em>\n    armed\n   </em>\n   one.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12707001,12578373\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/1240/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The robbery was armed. The clerk in the store reported having a handgun placed against her back and recalled seeing a silver tip on the handgun when it was pointed at her before the robber fled. The gun found in the Suburban was black, not silver. However, a jury could reasonably infer that the pistol found in the Suburban minutes after the robbery was the same one Gipson used during the robbery. Daniel argues hard that the clerk's testimony about a silver gun shows that the\n   <em>\n    black\n   </em>\n   gun found in the Suburban could not have been the gun used during the robbery. He contends this discrepancy, at the least, creates a reasonable doubt. This argument could have worked before the jury. On appeal, however, the jury's verdict receives the benefit of reasonable inferences that might be drawn in its favor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   At trial, Corse testified she saw a silver gun, but then hedged by stating \"[i]t was just the very tip of the barrel.... facing at [her.]\" Transcript of Jury Trial at 160,\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Corse also testified that she was very afraid during the entire robbery. The jury\n   could have rationally inferred that Corse honestly thought the gun was silver, but decided that she was mistaken due to the excitement of the moment and the available lighting. The jury viewed a security camera recording of robbery events at the cash register. Though the video is blurry, it shows Gipson press something against Corse's back. Both individuals' dark clothing makes it difficult to see the details of anything in Gipson's hand-silver, black, or otherwise. Corse's testimony places a gun in Gipson's hand aimed directly at her in a threatening manner. The video is inconclusive as to the gun's color. The jury heard the testimony and likely believed that Corse's recollection of a silver barrel tip was mistaken. Daniel asks us to reweigh this evidence, but we may not.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Moe\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5763756\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/536/825/#p832\">\n    536 F.3d at 832\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Daniel points out that the black pistol in the Suburban was located underneath a cupholder containing two cups full of soda. He highlights the improbability of Gipson's hurriedly entering the Suburban, removing the full cups and cupholder, hiding the gun underneath, and replacing the cupholder and cups. Daniel contrasts this apparently careful behavior with Gipson's haphazardly tossing Corse's wallet into the back seat, and tucking the incriminating $349 in cash in his pocket. All this, Daniel says, means the jury necessarily would have had a reasonable doubt that Daniel had advance knowledge that a gun would be used.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   We must view the above evidence in the light most favorable to the guilty verdict, and we conclude a reasonable jury could have found that the gun Gipson used was the same gun found in the Suburban afterwards. A jury could reasonably infer that Gipson stowed the loaded weapon underneath the cupholder, intending to quickly hide it in a seemingly inaccessible spot, rather than throwing it in the back seat with the other items. The presence of the gun in the vehicle Daniel drove could also support the reasonable inference that Daniel knew-in advance-that Gipson would use a gun.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   There was no evidence that Daniel abandoned Gipson's criminal endeavor after Gipson entered the Suburban.

Our cases have not so limited effects on interstate commerce.

Daniel also cites to\n   <em>\n    United States v.

But we did not hold that the business\n   <em>\n    must\n   </em>\n   be forced to close in order to find an effect on commerce-the stores' closures simply reinforced the \"effect on\n   commerce\" finding, but was not necessary to it.

He points to other model instructions, as well as other instructions within the set given here, that use \"may but are not required to infer.\" He says the jury might have noted the omission of \"but are not required to\" and took its conspicuous absence to mean the government had a lesser burden of proof.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   We are not persuaded. The instruction tracked the aiding and abetting instruction in the Manual of Model Criminal Jury Instructions for the District Courts of the Eighth Circuit. It is true that a later instruction in Daniel's case used the phrase \"You may, but are not required to, infer.\" Jury Instructions at 13. But there is no reason to think the omission in a different instruction misled the jury. Omitting the phrase \"but are not required to\" does not change the normal meaning of the phrase. \"May\" is not \"must,\" and it does not imply a requirement, but permission. Black's Law Dictionary first defines the word \"may\" as \"[t]o be permitted to.\"\n   <em>\n    May\n   </em>\n   , Black's Law Dictionary (10th ed. 2014). In\n   other words, the jury was permitted to make the inference or not. There is no reason to think the jury did not apply this commonly understood meaning.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Viewing the entire charge, we conclude the instructions clearly and correctly explained the government's burden. Jury Instructions at 5 (\"The presumption of innocence ... can be overcome only if the Government proved, beyond a reasonable doubt, each element of a crime charged.\"). The government's burden was not lessened as Daniel contends. The district court did not abuse its discretion in using \"may infer\" rather than \"may but are not required to infer\" in Instructions 8 and 9.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   ii.\n   <em>\n    \"Complete the Robbery\"\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Daniel's final argument contends that the district court abused its discretion by instructing the jury that it could infer advance knowledge if Daniel failed to object or withdraw after he observed \"another participant\n   <em>\n    complete\n   </em>\n   the robbery.\" Instead, he says, the district court should have used the phrase \"another participant\n   <em>\n    committing\n   </em>\n   the robbery.\" Thus, in relevant part in Instruction 8, Daniel contends the court should have instructed:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   You may but are not required to infer the defendant had the requisite advance knowledge of the robbery if you find the defendant failed to object or withdraw from actively participating in the commission of interference with commerce by robbery after the defendant observed another participant\n   <em>\n    committing\n   </em>\n   the robbery.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Defendant's Proposed Jury Instructions at 4,\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Thus the jury knew it could consider all the evidence-including evidence of Daniel's conduct before, during, and after the robbery took place-in order to determine his intent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   The district court also explicitly instructed the jury that, to convict Daniel of aiding and abetting interference with commerce by robbery, Daniel must \"have had enough advance knowledge of the extent and character of the robbery that he was able to make the relevant choice to walk away from the robbery before all elements of interference with commerce by robbery were complete.\" Jury Instructions at 9;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 11 (same in Instruction 9). This instruction correctly emphasized that the jury must find Daniel had\n   <em>\n    advance knowledge\n   </em>\n   that the robbery would be armed, in order to convict him on this count.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rosemond\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12707001,12578373\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/1240/\">\n    134 S.Ct. at 1249-50\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The challenged word \"complete\" in Instructions 8 and 9 did not mislead the jury nor did it have a probable effect on the verdict.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Thompson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6051633\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/686/575/#p579\">\n    686 F.3d at 579\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We conclude, viewing the entire charge to the jury and reading it as a whole, that the district court fairly and adequately instructed the jury on the law applicable to the case and did not abuse its discretion.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6051633\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/686/575/#p579\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   III.\n   <em>\n    Conclusion\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-65\">\n    The Honorable Stephen N.

Though the jury did not have to do so to convict, it could have found based on this evidence that Daniel actually furnished the gun for the crime.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-67\">\n    The instruction on the aiding and abetting the firearm possession count contained identical language in all relevant respects.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Jury Instructions at 12 (Instruction No. 9). Our analysis applies equally to both.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-68\">\n    Moreover, we note that Daniel's counsel argued the meaning of the word \"may\" to the jury in closing, stating about the word, \"what does that mean? You don't have to infer that. You have to look at the facts and see what the facts show.\" Transcript of Jury Trial at 418.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
