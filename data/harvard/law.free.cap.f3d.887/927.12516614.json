Section 19195 establishes a public list of the top 500 delinquent state taxpayers who owe in excess of $100,000. In turn, Section 494.5 provides for suspension of the driver's license of a taxpayer on the delinquent list until full payment of the tax obligation is arranged.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Appellant Ernest J. Franceschi, Jr., Esq. is a major tax delinquent. Anticipating the suspension of his driver's license after the publication of the next edition of the top 500 list-which would include him-Franceschi sued, under 42 U.S.C \u00a7 1983, challenging Sections 19195 and 494.5 on various federal constitutional grounds. The District Court rejected his claims and dismissed the complaint.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Franceschi v. Chiang\n   </em>\n   , No. 2:14-cv-01960-CAS-SH,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%2012069866\">\n    2014 WL 12069866\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (C.D. Cal. Aug. 4, 2014). Franceschi appeals and we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Franceschi is an attorney who has been licensed to practice law in California since 1984. Appellee Betty Yee is the chairwoman of the California Franchise Tax Board (the \"\n   <em>\n    FTB\n   </em>\n   \"); appellees George Runner and Michael Cohen are members of the FTB; and appellee Jean Shiomoto is the director of the California Department of Motor Vehicles.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Despite being a member of the bar for many years, Franceschi failed to file any California state income tax returns between 1995 and 2012 and failed to pay any state income taxes, penalties, or interest for those years, contending that he owed none. For each of those years, the FTB gave written notice of proposed deficiency assessments of taxes, interest and penalties (an \"\n   <em>\n    NPA\n   </em>\n   \").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   California's Revenue and Taxation Code sets forth a framework under which a delinquent taxpayer, like Franceschi, has multiple opportunities to challenge deficiency assessments.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2019031\">\n    Cal. Rev. &amp; Tax Code \u00a7 19031\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    et seq\n   </em>\n   . At the outset, the FTB is required to send the taxpayer notice of the proposed deficiency assessment for any tax deficiency it proposes to assess.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2019031\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 19033(a). The taxpayer may then file a protest within sixty days.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2019031\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 19041(a). If the taxpayer files a protest, the FTB must reconsider the assessment and, if the taxpayer so requests, grant the taxpayer a hearing on the deficiency.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2019031\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 19044(a). If the deficiency is not resolved at this stage, a taxpayer has further recourse by appealing to the State Board of Equalization.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2019031\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 19045. After the State Board of Equalization rules on the matter, a still dissatisfied taxpayer can then petition the State Board of Equalization for rehearing.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2019031\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 19048.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Still further, a taxpayer has an additional opportunity to be heard on the validity of his or her tax delinquency by paying the taxes and filing a claim for refund with the FTB.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2019031\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 19382. Utilization of this procedure here would have permitted Franceschi to both challenge the original assessments and to retain his driver's licence while doing so. If the FTB denied the claim he could have sued for a refund in California Superior Court. Franceschi concedes that he did not avail himself of any of these multiple remedial procedures.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   If, however, a taxpayer like Franceschi fails to protest the NPA within sixty days, the proposed deficiency assessment becomes final.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2019031\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 19042. Once the assessment becomes final, the FTB can demand payment and the amount owed becomes a lien on the taxpayer's real property in California.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2019031\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7\u00a7 19049, 19221.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The FTB compiles a list of the top 500 tax delinquents in the state (the \"\n   <em>\n    Top 500 List\n   </em>\n   \").\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2019031\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 19195(a).

If within thirty days after this notice, the delinquent taxpayer does not remit the amount due or make arrangements with the FTB for payment, the delinquent taxpayer is named on the Top 500 List.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2019031\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Important for this appeal, effective January 1, 2012, Section 494.5 was enacted to provide that a state governmental licensing entity \"shall suspend\" a license if a licensee's name is included on the Top 500 List.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%20494.5\">\n    Cal.

After the enactment of Section 494.5 in 2012, the FTB, in April 2012, March 2013, and March 2014, served him with NPAs for the years 2010 through 2012. Franceschi then had sixty days to protest these additional proposed deficiencies. He took no steps to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Franceschi alleges that he received notice from the FTB dated February 2014 indicating that he was to be included in the next publication of the Top 500 List because he owed $242,276.73 in back taxes. Franceschi further alleges that he anticipated that the DMV would suspend his driver license after the next publication of the Top 500 List.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In an effort to forestall his suspension, Franceschi sued under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , asserting claims for violations of his procedural and substantive due process rights, and the Equal Protection Clause.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   In addition he claimed that the 2012 enactment of Section 494.5 constituted a bill of attainder.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Franceschi\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%2012069866\">\n    2014 WL 12069866\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1. Franceschi also sought a preliminary injunction seeking to prohibit the publication of his name on the Top 500 List and the suspension of his driver's license. During the pendency of this action, after the District Court denied Franceschi's application for interlocutory relief, the DMV suspended his driver's license.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The defendants moved to dismiss Franceschi's lawsuit under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). The District Court concluded that the statutory scheme Franceschi challenged was constitutional. It held, among other things, that Franceschi had received adequate notice and an opportunity to be heard before his license was suspended. It also determined that the application of Sections 19195 and 494.5 to him did not violate his substantive due\n   process rights by impermissibly burdening his right to practice his profession or having retroactive effect, did not violate his equal protection rights, and did not constitute a bill of attainder.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%2012069866\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at *1-*13.

First, he argues that Section 494.5 does not provide an adequate opportunity to be heard prior to license revocation. Second, he argues that Section 494.5's payment plan and financial hardship exemptions are illusory. Neither of these contentions has merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The Supreme Court has held that a driver's license can be revoked without a pre-revocation hearing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dixon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2000\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/431/105/#p112\">\n    431 U.S. at 112-15\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2000\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/431/105/#p112\">\n    97 S.Ct. 1723\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Franceschi has no response to\n   <em>\n    Dixon\n   </em>\n   . He nevertheless goes on to argue that he should have been afforded a pre-deprivation hearing. Specifically, Franceschi argues that at such a pre-deprivation hearing, he would have been able to demonstrate that his actual tax delinquency was below the threshold $100,000 for inclusion on the Top 500 List when time-barred assessments, interest and penalties on time-barred assessments are excluded.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Franceschi's arguments overlook the fact that he had a readily available, constitutionally valid, pre-deprivation opportunity to prevent the suspension of his license. After receipt of the notice of revocation and before his license was suspended, Franceschi could have challenged his threatened suspension by paying his taxes and filing a refund claim with the FTB.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2019382\">\n    Cal.

He would then have the opportunity to file a refund claim and challenge the original tax assessment. In the event the FTB denied his refund claim, he could still obtain relief by suing for a refund in California Superior Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Courts have consistently held that pay first, litigate later procedures such as these satisfy due process in the context of tax collection.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Todd v.

Franceschi nonetheless argues that he did not have the same incentive to challenge the deficiency assessments before Section 494.5 established that his license could be revoked. To the extent that Franceschi suggests that his lack of incentive to challenge the initial assessments created a greater risk of erroneous deprivation, we think that risk is adequately mitigated by the availability of a refund action under Section 19382. Finally, California obviously has a strong interest in revenue collection, and the challenged statutory scheme appropriately reflects the importance of this interest.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Jolly v.

Franceschi attempts to sidestep this straightforward requirement by arguing that a driver's license is \"indispensable\" to the practice of law while at the same time conceding that \"it may be possible to get to some courts on a bus or other public transportation.\" He nevertheless argues doing so would be burdensome and time consuming. No doubt an inability to drive oneself around Los Angeles could make the practice of law more difficult. However, Franceschi still has access to public transit, taxis, or services such as Lyft or Uber. Accordingly, whatever burden may exist does not amount to a \"complete prohibition\" on Franceschi's ability to practice law, and thus, does not rise to a violation of substantive due process.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lowry v.

All that needs to be shown, he contends, is that it operates as a \"limitation\" or \"diminishes opportunity\" to pursue a chosen profession. However,\n   <em>\n    Arizona Dream Act Coalition\n   </em>\n   says nothing of the sort. On the contrary,\n   <em>\n    Arizona Dream Act Coalition\n   </em>\n   involved an equal protection claim and sheds little light on Franceschi's substantive due process claim. Concluding that, where plaintiffs have shown a likelihood of success on the merits of their equal protection claims, the denial of a driver's license would cause irreparable harm as required to support the issuance of an injunction, does not establish that the denial of a driver's license would amount to a substantive due process violation.

In other words, the effective date of Section 494.5 is not dispositive because Section 494.5's sanction is dependent on a taxpayer's current conduct (whether a taxpayer takes steps to discharge a past-due tax obligation) and not on past conduct (the incurrence of a past-due tax obligation).

In support, Franceschi cites\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6171849\" index=\"147\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/381/437/#p448\">\n    381 U.S. 437\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6171849\" index=\"148\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/381/437/#p448\">\n    85 S.Ct. 1707\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6171849\" index=\"149\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/381/437/#p448\">\n    14 L.Ed.2d 484\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This argument makes no sense. If names \"come and go\" from a list, then the list does not remain constant. Moreover, Franceschi misunderstands both\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   and the specificity requirement. In\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court held that a statute that imposed criminal liability upon Communist Party members who became officers in labor unions was a bill of attainder.\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6171849\" index=\"150\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/381/437/#p448\">\n    381 U.S. at 456-62\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6171849\" index=\"151\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/381/437/#p448\">\n    85 S.Ct. 1707\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In doing so the Supreme Court rejected the argument that the challenged statute did not constitute a bill of attainder because it did not \"inflict[ ] its deprivation\" upon named individuals but instead targeted the membership of the Communist Party.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6171849\" index=\"152\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/381/437/#p448\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6171849\" index=\"152\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/381/437/#p448\">\n    at 461\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6171849\" index=\"153\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/381/437/#p448\">\n    85 S.Ct. 1707\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"We cannot agree that the fact that [the challenged statue] inflicts its deprivation upon the membership of the Communist Party rather than upon a list of named individuals takes it out of the category of bills of attainder.\"). However, the Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   held that certain individuals were targeted, and, as such, the specificity requirement was clearly met there.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6171849\" index=\"154\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/381/437/#p448\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6171849\" index=\"154\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/381/437/#p448\">\n    at 452\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6171849\" index=\"155\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/381/437/#p448\">\n    85 S.Ct. 1707\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"The moment [the challenged statue] was enacted, respondent was given the choice of declining a leadership position in his union or incurring criminal liability.\"). Tellingly, the statute\n   in question in\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   had a trailing five-year disqualification period: it disqualified from holding union office not just present members of the Communist Party but also any one who within the previous five years had been a member of the Communist Party, an easily ascertainable group.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6171849\" index=\"156\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/381/437/#p448\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6171849\" index=\"156\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/381/437/#p448\">\n    at 458\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6171849\" index=\"157\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/381/437/#p448\">\n    85 S.Ct. 1707\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The situation here is different. Franceschi does not dispute that the group of taxpayers who find themselves subject to suspension is not static. And even more importantly, these taxpayers have the power to escape license revocation by fulfilling their tax obligations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   \"Finally, we review whether the past conduct defining the affected individual or group consists of 'irrevocable acts committed by them.' \"\n   <em>\n    SeaRiver\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11407933\" index=\"158\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/309/662/#p668\">\n    309 F.3d at 669\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Selective Serv.

Sections 19195 and 494.5 do not focus on irrevocable conduct. The non-payment of delinquent taxes is the action that led Franceschi (and others) onto the Top 500 List and to license suspension. A taxpayer can escape publication on the Top 500 List (and the attendant consequences) by, among other ways, making other payment arrangements with the FTB for full satisfaction of the tax delinquency, filing for bankruptcy protection, or making payment arrangements satisfactory to the FTB.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"164\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2019195\">\n    Cal.

Franceschi argues that it \"appears\" that the exemptions and releases from a Top 500 List are granted or denied in a \"completely arbitrary and capricious manner,\" and that, as such, the methods which the statute provides for exiting the list are \"largely illusory.\" However, Franceschi does not allege that he ever applied for or was denied a release from the Top 500 List, arbitrarily or otherwise. In the absence of plausibly pleaded allegations of arbitrary and capricious administration of the Top 500 List, we need not entertain his bare argument on appeal that the list is administered in such a manner.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   In sum, far from being triggered by past and ineradicable actions, license suspension as a result of Sections 19195 and 494.5 turns on the continuing fact of nonpayment, something which a delinquent taxpayer can rectify.\n   <em>\n    Selective Serv.
