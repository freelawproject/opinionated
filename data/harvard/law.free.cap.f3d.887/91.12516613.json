In each action, the district court, pursuant to the three-strikes provision of the Prison Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (\"PLRA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201915\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g), denied Akassy permission to proceed\n   <em>\n    in forma pauperis\n   </em>\n   , dismissed his complaint without prejudice to his filing a new action with payment of the filing fee, and barred him from bringing future actions IFP while a prisoner unless he is under imminent threat of serious physical injury. Akassy moves in this Court for leave to prosecute his appeals\n   <em>\n    in forma pauperis\n   </em>\n   , contending principally that the district court erred in concluding that he had previously incurred as many as three strikes. We have consolidated these appeals for purposes of ruling on these motions.

Two of the actions,\n   <em>\n    Akassy v. Hardy\n   </em>\n   (\"\n   <em>\n    Hardy\n   </em>\n   '') and\n   <em>\n    Akassy v. Simmons\n   </em>\n   (\"\n   <em>\n    Simmons\n   </em>\n   ''), were commenced in February and March, respectively, in the Eastern District of New York; the third action,\n   <em>\n    Akassy\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    v. Office of the Appellate Defender\n   </em>\n   (\"\n   <em>\n    Appellate Defenders\n   </em>\n   ''), was commenced in April in the District of Columbia. In each action, Akassy sought leave to proceed\n   <em>\n    in forma pauperis\n   </em>\n   . All three actions were eventually transferred, on venue grounds, to the Southern District of New York (\"SDNY\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Addressing the\n   <em>\n    Hardy\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Simmons\n   </em>\n   cases following their transfers to SDNY, the district court noted that Akassy had brought actions against several media organizations in SDNY in 2014,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Akassy v. N.Y. Times\n   </em>\n   , No. 14-CV-2499;\n   <em>\n    Akassy v. News Corp., Inc.\n   </em>\n   , No. 14-CV-2589;\n   <em>\n    Akassy v. PIX 11 News, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , No. 14-CV-3186;\n   <em>\n    Akassy v. Associated Press\n   </em>\n   , No. 14-CV-3213, complaining that their coverage in 2010 and 2011 of his criminal proceedings defamed him. The court noted (a) that an\n   order entered in 2015 dismissed four of those actions on the ground that each complaint, on its face, revealed that the claims it asserted were barred by New York's one-year statute of limitations-\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Akassy v. N.Y. Times\n   </em>\n   , No. 14-CV-2499, at 6 (S.D.N.Y. July 31, 2015)-and (b) that the appeals from those four dismissals had themselves been dismissed in 2015 \"as lack[ing] an arguable basis either in law or in fact\"; the court thus ordered Akassy to show cause why he should not be barred from pursuing the present actions\n   <em>\n    in forma pauperis\n   </em>\n   in light of the PLRA's three-strikes rule. Order To Show Cause in\n   <em>\n    Hardy\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Simmons\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Akassy v.

June 16, 2017) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In response to the order to show cause, Akassy made arguments similar to those he makes in support of his present motion for IFP status on these appeals (which we discuss below), contending principally that none of the above eight dismissals should be characterized as strikes within the meaning of \u00a7 1915(g) and stating that he had been assaulted by prison guards and other inmates and that his life was in danger.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The district court found Akassy's response insufficient to show that \u00a7 1915(g) was inapplicable. It concluded that \"[w]hile Plaintiff was a prisoner, he filed three or more cases that are deemed strikes because they were dismissed as frivolous or malicious or for failure to state a claim.\" Bar Order Under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201915\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g) in\n   <em>\n    Hardy\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Simmons\n   </em>\n   , dated July 27, 2017, at 3. The court denied Akassy's motions to proceed\n   <em>\n    in forma pauperis\n   </em>\n   , dismissed his complaints under the three-strikes rule, and barred Akassy from filing future actions\n   <em>\n    in forma pauperis\n   </em>\n   while a prisoner unless under imminent danger of serious physical injury. The court stated that these rulings were \"without prejudice\" to Akassy's \"commence[ment of] a new action\"-even as a prisoner-\"by paying the filing fee,\"\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . at 3 &amp; n.2, but noted that even such a fee-paid action would be dismissable if it were frivolous, malicious, failed to state a claim upon which relief may be granted, or sought monetary relief from a defendant entitled to immunity from such relief,\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . at 3 n.2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In dealing with the\n   <em>\n    Appellate Defenders\n   </em>\n   case following its transfer to SDNY, the district court noted that Akassy had also filed that case in 2017, well after he had accumulated more than three strikes. For the reasons stated with respect to the\n   <em>\n    Hardy\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Simmons\n   </em>\n   cases, the district court entered a parallel order in\n   <em>\n    Appellate Defenders\n   </em>\n   , principally denying Akassy\n   <em>\n    in forma pauperis\n   </em>\n   status, and dismissing the complaint without prejudice to his filing a new action with payment of the filing fee.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Order of Dismissal Under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201915\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g), dated September 20, 2017, at 2-3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   DISCUSSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In moving for\n   <em>\n    in forma pauperis\n   </em>\n   status to pursue his appeals challenging the dismissals in\n   <em>\n    Hardy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Simmons\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    Appellate Defenders\n   </em>\n   , Akassy contends principally (a) that none of the dismissals of his 2014 actions should have been counted as strikes under \u00a7 1915(g) for failure to state a claim on which relief may be granted, arguing \"I did state my claims with supporting exhibits\" (Akassy Motion for Leave To Appeal In Forma Pauperis A Bar Order Under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201915\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g) (\"Akassy's Present IFP Motion\"), at 8); and (b) that this Court's dismissals of his four appeals challenging the statute-of-limitations dismissals of his 2014 actions should not be counted as more than a single strike because of \"consolidat[ion]\" (\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . at 10-11). Akassy also claims that his\n   life is in danger; and he argues that \u00a7 1915(g) is unconstitutional, and that instead of dismissing his complaints the SDNY district court should have held the cases in abeyance until he could pay the filing fee. He moves for reversal of the judgments, contending,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , that the District of Columbia court in\n   <em>\n    Appellate Defenders\n   </em>\n   found his claims to be viable. We conclude that all of his contentions are meritless.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   We reject, first, Akassy's contention that the district court's 2015 statute-of-limitations-based dismissals should not be considered strikes.

We reject this contention as well. Appeals in separate actions may properly be consolidated only by order of the court of appeals,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Fed. R.

Indeed, even in fully \"consolidated appeals[,] the separate appeals do not merge into one,\" Fed. R. App. P. 3 Advisory Committee Note (1998);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Palmerv.

Evaluation of a current complaint's viability is, instead, the function of \u00a7 1915(e), which comes into play after a case has permissibly been brought and which instructs, in part, that \"[n]otwithstanding any filing fee, or any portion thereof, that may have been paid, the court shall dismiss the case at any time if the court determines that ... the action ... is frivolous or ... fails to state a claim on which relief may be granted,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201915\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(2) ;\n   <em>\n    see generally\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Neitzke\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"605680\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/490/319/\">\n    490 U.S. at 328\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"605680\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/490/319/\">\n    109 S.Ct. 1827\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting it is the function of \u00a7 1915(d) -the predecessor of \u00a7 1915(e) -to \"screen[ ] out inarguable claims\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   In any event, Akassy's argument that the District of Columbia court \"stated that\" his claims were \" 'viable' \" is misleading because the words he quotes appeared only in that court's statement that it was transferring venue because it \"presume[d]\n   <em>\n    without deciding\n   </em>\n   that the plaintiff raises viable legal claims,\"\n   <em>\n    Akassy v.

Given \u00a7 1915(g)'s provision that a three-strikes prisoner shall \"in no event bring\" a civil action without paying the filing fee, the district court plainly has the authority to dismiss an action filed in contravention of this provision.

His motions for\n   <em>\n    in forma pauperis\n   </em>\n   status are denied; his motions for reversal of the district court judgments that dismissed his actions are denied as moot. The appeals are dismissed as lacking an arguable basis either in law or in fact.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
