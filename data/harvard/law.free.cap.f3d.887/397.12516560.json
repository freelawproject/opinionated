A person commits Missouri second-degree burglary \"when he or she knowingly enters unlawfully or knowingly remains unlawfully in a building or inhabitable structure for the purpose of committing a crime therein.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Mo.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20569.170\">\n    Mo.

Here, whether the Missouri second-degree burglary statute is divisible turns on whether the language \"building or inhabitable structure\" lists separate elements delineating two distinct crimes (burglary of a building and burglary of an inhabitable structure) or various means by which a single crime (burglary of a building or inhabitable structure) can be committed. If they are elements, the statute is divisible and we may apply the modified categorical approach.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mathis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12598042\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/2243/#p2247\">\n    136 S.Ct. at 2249, 2256\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . If the modified categorical approach applies, then Naylor's sentence was properly enhanced under the ACCA, as it is undisputed that four of his Missouri second-degree burglary convictions were based on his knowing, unlawful entry into buildings.

If statutory alternatives are means, then the facts of the case will reflect whether the defendant was notified that one or both means were charged, and whether sufficient evidence supports a finding of guilt on one or both means, so that the court may decide whether to include one or both means in the instruction.

Hypothetically applying this law to Naylor's prior convictions, if the indictments had charged Naylor with burglary of a \"building or inhabitable structure\" and those counts had proceeded to a trial at which the government presented evidence only that Naylor burgled an \"inhabitable structure,\" any resulting conviction would likely be overturned.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lusk\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10135020\" index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/452/219/#p223\">\n    452 S.W.2d at 223\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[W]hen submitted in the disjunctive each [alternative] must be supported by evidence.\" (internal quotation marks omitted) ).

We are faced with conflicting precedent on how the courts of that state would solve this dilemma, and, in such a circumstance, the Supreme Court has authorized us to \"peek\" at \"the record of the prior conviction itself,\" including documents such as indictments and jury instructions,\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"for the sole and limited purpose of determining whether [the listed items are] element[s] of the offense.\"\n   <em>\n    Mathis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12598042\" index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/2243/#p2247\">\n    136 S.Ct. at 2256-57\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (alterations in original) (internal quotation marks omitted).

It is not hard to imagine a situation where a prosecutor elects to charge only one means under the facts of a given case,\n    <em>\n     i.e.\n    </em>\n    , where substantial evidence supports only one means.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"14\">\n   <p id=\"p-100\">\n    The Missouri Approved Instruction provides as follows:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-101\">\n    First, that (on) (on or about) [\n    <em>\n     date\n    </em>\n    ], in the (City) (County) of ______, State of Missouri, the defendant knowingly (entered) (remained) unlawfully (in) (a building) (an inhabitable structure) located at [\n    <em>\n     Briefly describe the location\n    </em>\n    .] and (owned) (possessed) by [\n    <em>\n     name of owner or possessor\n    </em>\n    ], and\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-102\">\n    Second, that defendant did so for the purpose of committing the crime of [\n    <em>\n     name of crime\n    </em>\n    ] therein ....\n   </blockquote>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"15\">\n   <p id=\"p-103\">\n    The lead opinion says that the Missouri Approved Charges for prosecutors \"could also suggest\" that parenthetical alternatives are necessarily means.\n    <em>\n     Ante\n    </em>\n    , at 406-07 n.12. But these charges are not binding on prosecutors, and they include a similar modest instruction that parenthetical terms should be omitted or included \"depending upon the facts of the particular case.\" Although the \"Supplemental Notes on Use\" recommend that prosecutors charge parenthetical alternatives in the conjunctive, the Supreme Court of Missouri has held that it is permissible to charge separate offenses conjunctively in a single count under certain factual circumstances.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     State v.
