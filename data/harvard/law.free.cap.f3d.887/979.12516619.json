The validity of the district court's denial will be addressed by the merits panel assigned to this case. We address only the question of whether to appoint a special prosecutor to defend the district court's decision in light of the United States' letter informing this Court that \"[t]he government does not intend to defend the district court's order.\" For the reasons discussed below, we will appoint a special prosecutor to provide briefing and argument to the merits panel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   I. Background\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Defendant-Appellant former Maricopa County Sheriff Joseph M. Arpaio (\"Sheriff Arpaio\") was referred for criminal contempt on August 19, 2016. The United States prosecuted Sheriff Arpaio and obtained a conviction on July 31, 2017. On August 25, 2017, President Donald J. Trump pardoned Sheriff Arpaio, noting that Sheriff Arpaio's sentencing was \"set for October 5, 2017.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On August 28, 2017, Sheriff Arpaio moved for two forms of relief. First, Sheriff Arpaio moved \"to dismiss this matter with prejudice.\" Second, Sheriff Arpaio asked the district court \"to vacate the verdict and all other orders in this matter, as well as the Sentencing on October 5th.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The district court granted Sheriff Arpaio's first request. On October 4, 2017, the district court dismissed with prejudice the action for criminal contempt. No timely notice of appeal from the dismissal order was filed. We denied a late-filed request for the appointment of counsel to \"cross-appeal the District Court's Order dismissing the charges.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The district court denied Sheriff Arpaio's second request. On October 19, 2017, the district court denied vacatur and refused to grant \"relief beyond dismissal with prejudice.\" That same day, Sheriff Arpaio filed a timely notice of appeal. In response to a request for the appointment of counsel to \"defend the District Court's Order denying Arpaio's request for vacatur,\" we ordered the United States to \"file a statement indicating whether it intends to enter an appearance and file an answering brief in this appeal.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The United States responded that it \"does not intend to defend the district court's order from October 19, 2017 ...; instead, the government intends to argue, as it did in the district court, that the motion to vacate should have been granted.\" The United States took \"no position on whether the Court should appoint counsel to make any additional arguments.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   II. Discussion\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Because the United States has abandoned any defense of the district court's decision with respect to vacatur, the merits panel of our court that will decide this appeal will not receive the benefit of full briefing and argument unless we appoint a special prosecutor to defend the decision of the district court. For the reasons that follow, we will appoint a special prosecutor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   First, we conclude that we have the authority to appoint counsel under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 42, which prescribes procedures for dealing with criminal contempt. Rule 42(a)(2) provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   <em>\n    Appointing a Prosecutor\n   </em>\n   . The court must request that the contempt be prosecuted by an attorney for the government, unless the interest of justice requires the appointment of another attorney. If the government declines the request, the court must appoint another attorney to prosecute the contempt.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In Rule 42(a)(2)'s most common application, the district court appoints a special prosecutor to investigate and try a criminal contempt when the government declines to perform that function.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Hollingsworth v.

A private attorney appointed under the rule has the authority to act as a special prosecutor not only in the district court but also in the court of appeals.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Young v.

Rule 42(a)(2) is not applicable here. Arpaio effectively conceded his guilt\n   by accepting the pardon, and there is no need for more investigation, presentation of evidence, or further proceedings to determine if the equitable relief of vacatur is appropriate. The United States has told us it is not abdicating its responsibility to represent the Government's interest in this appeal. Nor do\n   <em>\n    amici\n   </em>\n   attempt to hide the true purpose of their request-to challenge the underlying pardon. But the constitutionality of the President's pardon is not at issue in Arpaio's current appeal; the denial of Arpaio's motion for vacatur of his conviction is. The request is inappropriate. My colleagues' decision to appoint separate counsel now is therefore ill-advised and unnecessary. I respectfully dissent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Following his pardon on August 25, 2017, Arpaio moved to dismiss his criminal contempt conviction with prejudice and for vacatur of the record. On October 4, 2017, an able United States district judge found that the pardon was valid, dismissed the action for criminal contempt, entered that order on the public docket, and closed the case. The order also denied\n   <em>\n    amici\n   </em>\n   's motion to appoint a Rule 42 attorney, but reserved ruling on Arpaio's additional request for vacatur. After considering further briefing on whether to vacate, the district court denied the request for vacatur on October 19, 2017, and Arpaio timely appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <em>\n    Amici\n   </em>\n   initially wanted us to appoint a special prosecutor to both defend the October 19 vacatur order and file a notice of appeal from the district court's earlier October 4 dismissal order. We denied\n   <em>\n    amici\n   </em>\n   's motion in part, however, because under Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 4(b)(1)(B)(ii), the time for filing an appeal to challenge the constitutionality of the pardon had run. Nov. 22 Order, Dkt. 9;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

In short, the basis for our November 22 Order was that\n   <em>\n    amici\n   </em>\n   were too late because they missed the deadline to raise a constitutional challenge to the earlier order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   We also asked the United States to state its intentions regarding Arpaio's separate vacatur appeal. The Government responded that it had entered an appearance and \"intends to represent the government's interests in this appeal.\" The Government explained that, instead of defending the district court's October 19 order, it \"intends to argue ... that the motion to vacate should have been granted.\" That ought to have been the end of the matter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   But because the United States has chosen not to defend the vacatur order,\n   <em>\n    amici\n   </em>\n   now assert that the Government is declining to prosecute Arpaio's criminal contempt conviction and that we are\n   <em>\n    required\n   </em>\n   to appoint special counsel. Regrettably, my colleagues in the majority agree. Sound judicial discretion instead counsels that we should deny the request and not appoint a special prosecutor at this late date in the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The request to appoint a private lawyer under Rule 42(a)(2), in place of the United States, is inappropriate now because it effectively gives interested parties an avenue to belatedly appeal the pardon's effect on successful conviction, despite the Government's continued participation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The criminal contempt case was successfully prosecuted by the United States,\n   which did not hesitate or decline to prosecute.

It maintains that it continues to represent the public (and the Executive) interest in the vacatur proceedings.\n   <em>\n    Amici\n   </em>\n   , however, would have us believe that because the United States supports the vacatur, such action is tantamount to the Government declining to prosecute a criminal contempt conviction. But they cite no cases for the proposition that Rule 42 requires appointing a special prosecutor where, as here, the Government has already successfully obtained a conviction, but the President has pardoned the contemnor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Nor does \"the interest of justice\" mandate that the Government be precluded from continuing to act as a prosecutor so the record of Arpaio's conviction may be maintained. Fed. R. Crim. P. 42(a)(2). And because the pardon does not erase Arpaio's guilt or expunge the fact of the judgment, there is no underlying affront to the court's authority stemming from criminal contempt left to vindicate.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re North\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7418220,5708685\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/62/1434/\">\n    62 F.3d 1434\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1437 (D.C.
