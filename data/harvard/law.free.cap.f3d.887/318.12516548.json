Cureton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=845%20F.3d%20323\">\n    845 F.3d 323\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (7th Cir. 2017). The Supreme Court remanded for reconsideration in light of\n   <em>\n    Dean v. United States\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12603201\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1170/\">\n    137 S.Ct. 1170\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12603201\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1170/\">\n    197 L.Ed.2d 490\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2017), which disapproved our circuit precedents such as\n   <em>\n    United States v. Roberson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5712200\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/474/432/\">\n    474 F.3d 432\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (7th Cir. 2007), barring judges sentencing defendants under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c) and other crimes from considering the mandatory minimum sentence under \u00a7 924(c) when deciding the sentences for other crimes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   We then remanded to the district court for the limited purpose of giving that court an opportunity to determine whether it would have imposed the same sentence on Cureton, now knowing that in light of\n   <em>\n    Dean\n   </em>\n   , it may consider the mandatory sentence under \u00a7 924(c) when deciding the sentences for other crimes.\n   <em>\n    United States v. Cureton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12515995\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/882/714/\">\n    882 F.3d 714\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (7th Cir. 2018). The district court solicited and reviewed briefs from the parties and acted promptly.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On March 21, 2018, the district judge issued an order explaining that he saw no basis for reducing Cureton's sentence. Judge Herndon quoted his own comments in resentencing Cureton and Judge Murphy's comments at Cureton's original sentencing. Both judges focused on the extraordinary viciousness of Cureton's crimes, including the kidnapping and torture of the woman who was his victim. The order on limited remand referred to Cureton's \"extreme\" capacity for \"violence and depravity\" and said that any lower sentence would not be sufficient to serve the purposes of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203553\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The district court has complied with the terms of our limited remand. We see no need for further proceedings in this case on the subject of\n   <em>\n    Dean\n   </em>\n   . The judgments of the district court, including the 444-month total term of imprisonment, are\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   AFFIRMED.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
