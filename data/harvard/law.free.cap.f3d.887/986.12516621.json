The motion is construed as a petition for rehearing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. App. P. 2 (\"On its own or a party's motion, a court of appeals may-to expedite its decision or for other good cause-suspend any provision of these rules in a particular case and order proceedings as it directs ....); 10th Cir. R. 2.1 (The court may suspend any part of these rules in a particular case on its own or on a party's motion.\"). As so construed, the motion is granted. The Clerk is directed to accordingly amend the opinion issued on August 15, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   This order shall act as a supplement to the mandate issued on October 10, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In an amendment to the Clean Air Act (CAA), Congress directed the EPA to operate a Renewable Fuel Standards Program (the RFS Program) to increase oil refineries' use of renewable fuels. But for small refineries that would suffer a \"disproportionate economic hardship\" in complying with the RFS Program, the statute required the EPA to grant exemptions on a case-by-case basis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   We conclude the EPA has exceeded its statutory authority under the CAA in interpreting the hardship exemption to require a threat to a refinery's survival as an ongoing operation. That interpretation is outside the range of permissible interpretations of the statute and therefore inconsistent with Congress's statutory mandate. Because we find that the EPA exceeded its statutory authority, we vacate the EPA's decisions and remand to the EPA for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In the Energy Policy Act of 2005, Congress amended the CAA to encourage the use of renewable fuels. The statute's RFS program requires oil refineries to either produce a sufficient proportion of renewable fuels as part of their output or purchase credits generated by other refineries to meet their increased renewable-fuel obligations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%207545\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7545\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (o) ;\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=40%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2080.1429\">\n    40 C.F.R. \u00a7 80.1429\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The Renewable Fuel Standards Program\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Through the RFS Program, Congress prescribed annual target volumes for renewable fuel sales, which increase each year until reaching a maximum level in 2022.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Congress charged the EPA with implementing the RFS Program and empowered it with authority to alter the statutory volumes of renewable fuel if the EPA finds that the RFS Program is causing severe economic or environmental harm or there is an inadequate supply of domestic renewable fuels. The EPA must also consult with the Department of Energy (DOE) in exercising this power.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%207545\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7545\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (o)(7).

A RIN is created when a producer makes a gallon of renewable fuel, blends the renewable fuel with petroleum-based fuel, and sells the resulting product domestically.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=40%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2080.1429\">\n    40 C.F.R. \u00a7 80.1429\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . An obligated-party can accumulate RINs to meet its RFS Program requirement by: (1) blending renewable fuels into petroleum-based fuel and selling the product domestically; or (2) obtaining RINs through another source, such as the RIN trading system Congress directed the EPA to establish.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%207545\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7545\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (o)(5). Put simply, the program induces refineries to produce renewable fuel products (e.g., ethanol), and if they cannot, to purchase biofuel-generated credits from refineries that can.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     B. Small Refinery Exemptions\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Congress was aware the RFS Program might disproportionately impact small refineries because of the inherent scale advantages of large refineries and therefore created three classes of exemptions to protect these small refineries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   First, the statute exempted all small refineries from the RFS Program until 2011.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%207545\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7545\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (o)(9).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Second, in the meantime, Congress directed DOE to conduct a study \"to determine whether compliance [with the RFS Program] ... would impose a disproportionate economic hardship on small refineries\" after the program's implementation.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%207545\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7545\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (o)(9)(A)(ii)(I). DOE conducted the study in 2011 and determined that a number of small refineries, including Sinclair's two Wyoming refineries, would suffer \"disproportionate economic hardship\" if they were required to comply with the RFS Program.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, the EPA extended the blanket exemption for two more years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Third, after the exemption period expired, Congress provided a process for small refineries to petition the EPA \"at any time\" for an extension of the initial exemption \"for reason of disproportionate economic hardship.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%207545\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7545\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (o)(9)(B)(i). In evaluating these petitions, the EPA must consult with DOE and consider the findings of DOE's study in addition to \"other economic factors.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%207545\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7545\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (o)(9)(B)(ii).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   This third exemption is at issue in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     C. Sinclair's Petitions for Small Refinery Exemptions\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Sinclair owns and operates two refineries in Wyoming: one located in Sinclair, Wyoming, and another in Casper, Wyoming. Both fall within the RFS Program's definition of \"small refinery\" and were exempt\n   from the RFS requirements until 2011. Those exemptions were extended until 2013 after DOE found Sinclair's Wyoming refineries to be among the 13 of 59 small refineries that would continue to face \"disproportionate economic hardship\" if required to comply with the RFS Program.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Sinclair then petitioned the EPA to extend their small-refinery exemptions, arguing that both refineries would continue to suffer \"disproportionate economic hardship\" under the RFS Program. The EPA denied Sinclair's petitions in two separate decisions, finding that both refineries appeared to be profitable enough to pay the cost of the RFS Program. Sinclair filed a timely petition for review with this court. We grant Sinclair's petition for review, vacate the EPA's decisions for both of Sinclair's refineries, and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   We review Sinclair's petitions under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA).

The parties do not seriously contest this conclusion. The decisions were\n   <em>\n    adjudications\n   </em>\n   because they were specific to the parties at issue-in fact, they were specific even to the individual refineries at issue (the EPA produced separate decisions for the Sinclair, Wyoming and Casper, Wyoming refineries)-and were resolving petitions for Sinclair's exemptions from the RFS Program. The decisions were also\n   <em>\n    informal\n   </em>\n   because they were resolved on the basis of Sinclair's submissions and involved no oral argument, opportunity for cross-examination, or other \"trial-like\" procedures generally required by the APA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pierce,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , at Vol. 1 \u00a7 8.2 (describing the trial-like procedures the APA requires for formal adjudications);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   J.A.

First of all, Congress specifically authorized the EPA to promulgate regulations on aspects of the RFS Program, but not for the small refinery exemptions.

In its 2011 study, DOE created a scoring matrix for determining its recommendations for granting exemptions. The first part of the matrix assesses the \"disproportionate structural and economic\" impacts of the RFS Program on the refinery,\n   looking both at (1) \"disproportionate structural impact metrics\" (a refinery's percentage of diesel production, access to credit, local market acceptance of renewable fuels, etc.) and (2) \"disproportionate economic impact metrics\" (the firm's relative refining margin, the degree to which the refiner can blend renewable fuels, whether RINs are a net source of revenue, etc.).

Instead, DOE recommends a 50 percent waiver if the ranking meets a certain threshold on either side of the matrix, although the DOE previously required the ranking meet certain thresholds on\n   <em>\n    both\n   </em>\n   sides of the matrix. J.A. Vol. 1 at 17. DOE's scoring change \"is due to language included in an explanatory statement accompanying the 2016 Consolidated Appropriations Act,\" which instructed the DOE as follows: \" 'If the Secretary finds that either of these two components exists, the Secretary is directed to recommend to the EPA Administrator a 50 percent waiver of RFS requirements for the petitioner.' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%207545\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016, Pub.

If long-term \"viability\" was merely\n   <em>\n    one\n   </em>\n   element the EPA considered in its \"disproportionate economic hardship\" analysis, that would be a different story.

Br. at 35;\n   <em>\n    see Oxford English Dictionary\n   </em>\n   (2017) (defining \"hardship\" as \"[s]omething which is hard to bear\");\n   <em>\n    Black's Law\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dictionary\n   </em>\n   (10th ed. 2014) (defining \"hardship\" as \"[p]rivation; suffering or adversity\");\n   <em>\n    Webster's Third New Int'l Dictionary\n   </em>\n   1033 (1971) (defining \"hardship\" as \"something that causes or entails suffering or privation\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   \"[V]iability,\" on the other hand, is the \"ability to continue or be continued; the state of being financially sustainable.\"\n   <em>\n    Oxford English Dictionary\n   </em>\n   (2017);\n   <em>\n    see also Webster's Third New Int'l Dictionary\n   </em>\n   2548 (1971) (defining \"viability\" as \"the quality or state of being viable,\" and defining \"viable,\" in turn, as \"capable of living\"). As a matter of common sense, an experience that causes hardship is less burdensome than an experience that threatens one's very existence. Our law clerks, for example, might say their first year of law school was a \"hardship\" they suffered, but they could hardly claim that the experience of learning the law threatened their very \"viability\" (we hope).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   The EPA argues that \"viability\" and \"hardship\" are the same, since \"hardship\" can be defined as \"suffering\" and \"privation.\" Aple. Br. at 38. But as we just explained, \"suffering\" and \"privation\" may be difficult to bear, but they do not necessarily rise to the level of threatening one's very existence. And the EPA's interpretation of \"viability\" is akin to a death knell, not simple privation. In any event, DOE's matrix analysis supplied three \"viability metrics\" that collectively determine hardship: (1) reduced profitability; (2) temporary negative events; and (3) risk of closure.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   J.A. Vol. 1 at 103. The EPA's interpretation ignores two-thirds of this analysis and selects only risk of closure as the appropriate measure of hardship. This is not a reasonable interpretation of the statutory term. In short, the EPA's equation of \"hardship\" and \"viability\" improperly transforms Congress's statutory text into something far beyond what Congress plausibly intended.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   The statute also commands the EPA to consider the\n   <em>\n    disproportionate\n   </em>\n   impact of the RFS Program, which inherently requires a comparative evaluation. The EPA must compare the effect of the RFS Program compliance costs on a given refinery with the economic state of other refineries. The EPA's viability test involves no such comparison, but instead looks at each refinery in isolation and asks whether the cost of long-term compliance with the RFS Program would force the refinery to shut down. By making long-term viability a necessary factor in its analysis, the EPA impermissibly reads the word \"disproportionate\" out of the statute.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Clark v. Rameker\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4073195\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/2242/#p2248\">\n    134 S.Ct. 2242\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 2248,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=189%20L.%20Ed.%202d%20157\">\n    189 L.Ed.2d 157\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2014) (\"a statute should be construed so that effect is given to all its provisions, so that no part will be inoperative or superfluous\"). The EPA tries to sidestep the comparative nature of the \"disproportionate economic hardship\" by pointing out that the statute requires the EPA to consider DOE's study and \"other economic factors.\" Because viability is one of the factors considered by DOE, the EPA argues it is also an appropriate consideration for the EPA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Reply Br. at 11. But as we explained above, the statutory requirements for what\n   <em>\n    sources\n   </em>\n   the EPA must consider in evaluating the petitions are distinct from the overall\n   <em>\n    purpose\n   </em>\n   of the inquiry. In effect, the EPA takes the holistic evaluation required by Congress and morphs it into a single question: a threat of closure inquiry.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   The EPA's narrow viability evaluation is also not supported by contextual clues in the statutory scheme. Congress, in fact, directed the EPA to apply a closure test for another part of the CAA involving primary nonferrous smelter orders.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%207419\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7419\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(2) (requirement to use continuous\n   emission reduction technology can be waived \"upon a showing by the owner or operator of the smelter that\n   <em>\n    such requirement would be so costly as to necessitate permanent or prolonged temporary cessation of operations\n   </em>\n   of the smelter.\" (emphasis added)). Although this CAA provision is not part of the RFS Program, it makes the basic point that Congress knows how to supply a closure test when it intends to do so.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Antonin Scalia &amp; Bryan A.

The court rejected the refinery's challenge under\n   <em>\n    Chevron\n   </em>\n   step one, concluding that the EPA's reliance on a viability index did not contradict the plain language of \u00a7 7545(o)(9)(B) because so long as \"EPA consults with DOE and considers the 2011 Study and 'other economic factors,' EPA retains substantial discretion to decide how to evaluate hardship petitions.\"\n   <em>\n    Hermes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4228238,4222367\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/787/568/\">\n    787 F.3d at 574-75\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal citation omitted).

In other words, the court found it reasonable for the EPA to incorporate the methodology from the 2011 DOE study, and the viability matrix in particular, because the statute requires the EPA to consider the findings of the study and \"other economic factors\" in evaluating hardship petitions.

Whether that presumed test would pass muster may present an interesting question, but it is quite academic to the real issue before us. Assuredly, the EPA decisions include a regrettably inartful sentence-a partial quote from the 2011 Small Refinery Exemption Study issued by the Department of Energy (the \"Department\"). However, when construed as a whole, those decisions demonstrate that EPA applies a more nuanced analysis. Rather than adopting a one-factor test looking solely to whether a shutdown is likely, it seems clear to me that EPA is applying the three-pronged \"viability metrics\" developed by the Department. Under those standards, a refinery can establish economic hardship under four different circumstances, only one of which requires a threat of shutdown. Because the majority proceeds on a misconstruction of the EPA analysis, I must respectfully dissent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   <strong>\n    I\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   In its decisions in this case, EPA discussed the Department's study at length.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   It quotes the Department's determination\n   that \"[d]isproportionate economic hardship must encompass two broad components: [1] a high cost of compliance relative to the industry average, and [2] an effect sufficient to cause a significant impairment of the refinery operations.\" EPA explained that it asked the Department \"to evaluate all of the information EPA receives from each petitioner\" because the Department \"has expertise in evaluating economic conditions at U.S. refineries, which it used in developing an assessment process for identifying when 'disproportionate economic hardship' exists in the context of the [Renewable Fuel Standard (\"RFS\") ] program.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   In resolving the two components of cost and sufficiency of the effect, the Department considers numerous factors which are grouped into two categories-structural and viability. In assessing \"disproportionate structural impacts,\" the Department scores a refinery on eight metrics: percentage of diesel production, access to capital/credit, availability of other cash flows, local market, state regulation, relative refining margin, blending capability, and niche market. Under the \"viability\" category, the Department considers three metrics: whether compliance costs \"would reduce the profitability of the firm enough to impair future efficiency improvements\"; \"[r]efinery specific events (such as a shutdown due to an accident, and subsequent loss of revenue) in the recent past that have a temporary negative impact on the ability of the refinery to comply\"; and whether compliance costs are \"likely to lead to shut down.\" Each metric is scored either 0, 5, or 10. Subtotal scores for the structural and viability categories are then averaged and divided by 2. The Department's study determined that an exemption would be warranted only if a refinery had an overall score of 1 or higher in both categories. For the viability category, a refinery can qualify with a score of 10 on any single metric, or with an intermediate score of 5 on both the efficiency and specific event metrics.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   After providing background information on Sinclair Wyoming Refinery's operations, the EPA decision reproduces the Department's scoring matrix for the facility. That metric calculated a score of 1.6 on the structural impact category, and 0 for the viability category. Then, EPA evaluated \"viability using the metrics considered by [the Department] in its viability index: (a) compliance costs eliminate efficiency gains (impairment); (b) individual special events; and (c) compliance costs likely to lead to shut down.\" Considering the Department's score of zero on all three viability factors, EPA concluded that Sinclair Wyoming Refinery \"remains fully able to comply with its 2014 RFS obligations without causing a significant impairment of the refinery's operations,\" and thus compliance would not threaten its \"viability.\" EPA specifically considered Sinclair's argument that a fire at the refinery caused a large one-time loss-an argument clearly directed toward the specific event metric. And it discussed the RFS program's impact on efficiency gains as relevant to the first metric.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   The majority opinion does not consider this lengthy discussion. If it had, it would be abundantly clear that EPA considers all three of the Department's viability factors. Importantly, a refinery can qualify for an exemption under the Department's matrix without showing that compliance costs would lead to a shutdown. Rather than considering EPA's nuanced approach, the majority opinion focuses on the statement that a refinery must show that compliance costs would \"significantly impact the operation of the firm, leading eventually to an inability to increase efficiency to remain competitive, eventually resulting in closure.\" (Majority Op. 995.) Read in context,\n   that statement does not support the assertion that EPA applies a single-factor test under which a refinery must show a shutdown is likely.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   The statement at issue is a direct quote from the Department's Small Refinery Exemption Study. In describing its three viability metrics, the Department explained that the term \"viability refers to the ability of the refiners to remain competitive and profitable,\" which \"requires sufficient profits to make investments in the refinery.\" That statement quoted by EPA explains that \"under some circumstances, a small refinery may face compliance costs that would significantly impact the operation of the firm, leading eventually to an inability to increase efficiency to remain competitive, eventually resulting in closure.\" Read together with the Department's explanation of the metrics, the quoted passage shows that eventual closure is not required. Refineries may receive points under the efficiency metric because \"significant constraints on efficiency improvements would eventually leave many small refineries at risk.\" And the individual special events metric is specifically aimed to provide relief to refineries that have suffered incidents causing \"a temporary negative impact on the ability of the refinery to comply with the RFS.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   In discussing \"viability\" in the challenged decisions, EPA is referring to all three metrics-not just the possibility of refinery closure. The majority opinion's reliance on the ordinary usage definition of \"viability,\" and its claim that EPA ignored the first two of the Department's viability metrics, (Majority Op. 996-97, 997-98), cannot be squared with the text of the challenged decisions. Those decisions unequivocally state that EPA \"evaluates viability using the metrics considered by [the Department] in its viability index: (a) compliance costs eliminate efficiency gains (impairment); (b) individual special events; and (c) compliance costs likely to lead to shut down.\" Therefore, the appropriate question in reviewing the decisions at issue is whether that multi-factor analysis is consistent with the statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   <strong>\n    II\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   Regardless of the standard of review applied, EPA's adoption of the Department's three-part viability test should be upheld.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Edelman v.

Consistent with the Congressional directive, that study created the viability standard actually being applied by EPA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   Consideration of a refinery's overall health makes sense in light of the statute's use of the term \"hardship.\" \u00a7 7545(o)(9)(B)(i). As the EPA decision notes, a refinery must show it \"faces a\n   'disproportionate economic\n   <em>\n    hardship\n   </em>\n   ' from compliance, and not merely an economic\n   <em>\n    impact\n   </em>\n   .\" A refinery that spends $5 million per year to meet its RFS obligations and suffers net annual operating losses of $1 million per year would experience more of a \"hardship\" than a refinery that spends $10 million per year on RFS compliance but nevertheless operates at a profit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   In an \"Explanatory Statement\" contained in the 2016 Consolidated Appropriations Act, Congress directed the Department to recommend a 50% waiver for refineries that score above 1 on the Department's matrix for either the viability or structural impact categories.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016, Pub.

Because that statement did not amend the statute, it should have little bearing on our analysis of the statutory text.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bruesewitz v. Wyeth LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12457248,5925915\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/562/223/\">\n    562 U.S. 223\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 242,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12457248,5925915\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/562/223/\">\n    131 S.Ct. 1068\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12457248,5925915\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/562/223/\">\n    179 L.Ed.2d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2011) (\"Post-enactment legislative history (a contradiction in terms) is not a legitimate tool of statutory interpretation.\"). As EPA explained, despite the appropriations rider, the agency \"remains constrained by the plain governing statutory language that limits exemption extensions to small refineries that experience a 'disproportionate economic hardship.' \" Moreover, as noted by EPA, \"a refinery could satisfy the nonviability metrics as a result of primarily refining diesel and not having other lines of business, regardless of how profitable the refinery was or what the impact of compliance with the RFS would be on the refinery.\" I agree that \"it would [not] be appropriate to grant even a 50% waiver for 'disproportionate economic hardship' in these circumstances without some further consideration of whether compliance with the RFS would actually cause such a hardship.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   Finally, reliance on the Department's study necessarily incorporates a disproportionality element. That study applied the Department's metrics to a broad cross-section of small refineries and found thirteen qualified for an exemption. Under that matrix, Sinclair's refineries do not qualify for an exemption for compliance year 2014. Even if the Department was required to depart from the study's findings due to an appropriations act requirement, EPA followed the statute when it relied on the Department's study in making these evaluations. The agency was mandated to consider both the study and the Department's recommendation. \u00a7 7545(o)(9)(B)(ii).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   Two other circuits have approved EPA's approach.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lion Oil Co. v.

Hoping to avoid a circuit split, my majority colleagues unconvincingly attempt to distinguish these cases. They characterize both as having decided, unlike this case, whether EPA can consider viability as a factor, rather than the only factor. (Majority Op. 998-99.) As explained above, the majority's framing misstates what EPA did in the present case. The majority opinion also dismisses the cases claiming that those courts did not consider the appropriate degree of deference. But both decisions speak favorably of using viability as a factor.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lion Oil\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4275863\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/792/978/\">\n    792 F.3d at 984\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Of course, some refineries will face higher costs than others, but whether those costs impose disproportionate\n   <em>\n    hardship\n   </em>\n   on a given refinery presents a different question\" and EPA reasonably concluded \"that the best way to measure 'hardship' entail[s] examining the impact of compliance costs on a refinery's ability to maintain profitability and competitiveness-i.e., viability-in the long term.\" (quotation omitted));\n   <em>\n    Hermes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4228238,4222367\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/787/568/\">\n    787 F.3d at 575\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (same).

(Majority Op. 18 n.5.) But as with the decisions at issue, the statement must be read in context. EPA's brief strenuously rejects the reading of its decisions urged by Sinclair and adopted by the majority. After quoting Sinclair's argument that a refinery must demonstrate that RFS compliance \"will eventually force a small refinery to shut down,\" EPA states: \"This is not an accurate characterization of EPA's interpretation because it gives the incorrect impression that the Agency will grant the exemption only if it concludes that the refinery will have to close if it has to comply with its RFS requirements.\" (Resp't Br. 40.) Instead, consistent with its decisions, EPA explains that \"[t]he viability factor addresses three types of metrics that could impact long-term competitiveness, none of which necessarily would cause a closure of the facility in the near term.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 38-39.)\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
