The question before us is also simple: can an employer justify a wage differential between male and female employees by relying on prior salary? Based on the text, history, and purpose of the Equal Pay Act, the answer is clear: No. Congress recognized in 1963 that the Equal Pay Act was long overdue: \"Justice and fairplay speak so eloquently [on] behalf of the equal pay for women bill that it seems unnecessary to belabor the point. We can only marvel that it has taken us so long to recognize the fact that equity and economic soundness support this legislation.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Salaries speak louder than words, however. Although the Act has prohibited sex-based wage discrimination for more than fifty years, the financial exploitation of working women embodied by the gender pay gap continues to be an embarrassing reality of our economy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Prior to this decision, our law was unclear whether an employer could consider prior salary, either alone or in combination with other factors, when setting its employees' salaries. We took this case\n   <em>\n    en banc\n   </em>\n   in order to clarify the law, and we now hold that prior salary alone or in combination with other factors cannot justify a wage differential. To hold otherwise-to allow employers to capitalize on the persistence of the wage gap and perpetuate\n   that gap\n   <em>\n    ad infinitum\n   </em>\n   -would be contrary to the text and history of the Equal Pay Act, and would vitiate the very purpose for which the Act stands.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Fresno County Office of Education (\"the County\")\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   does not dispute that it pays Aileen Rizo (\"Rizo\") less than comparable male employees for the same work. However, it argues that this wage differential is lawful under the Equal Pay Act. In relevant part, the Act provides,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   No employer having employees subject to any provisions of this section shall discriminate, within any establishment in which such employees are employed, between employees on the basis of sex by paying wages to employees in such establishment at a rate less than the rate at which he pays wages to employees of the opposite sex in such establishment for equal work on jobs the performance of which requires equal skill, effort, and responsibility, and which are performed under similar working conditions, except where such payment is made pursuant to (i) a seniority system; (ii) a merit system; (iii) a system which measures earnings by quantity or quality of production; or (iv)\n   <em>\n    a differential based on any other factor other than sex\n   </em>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20206\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 206\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(1) (emphasis added). The County contends that that the wage differential is based on the fourth exception-the catchall exception: a \"factor other than sex.\" It argues that an employee's prior salary can constitute a \"factor other than sex\" within the meaning of the catchall exception. However, this would allow the County to defend a sex-based salary differential on the basis of the very sex-based salary differentials the Equal Pay Act was designed to cure. Because we conclude that prior salary does not constitute a \"factor other than sex,\" the County fails as a matter of law to set forth an affirmative defense. We affirm the district court's denial of summary judgment to the County and remand for proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Aileen Rizo was hired as a math consultant by the Fresno County Office of Education in October 2009. Previously, she was employed in Maricopa County, Arizona as a middle and high school math teacher. In her prior position, Rizo earned an annual salary of $50,630 for 206 working days. She also received an educational stipend of $1,200 per year for her master's degrees in educational technology and mathematics education.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Rizo's new salary upon joining the County was determined in accordance with the County's Standard Operating Procedure 1440 (\"SOP 1440\"), informally adopted in 1998 and formally adopted in 2004. The County's hiring schedule consists of 10 stepped salary levels, each level containing 10 salary steps within it. SOP 1440 dictates that a new hire's salary is to be determined by taking the hired individual's prior salary, adding 5%, and placing the new employee on the corresponding step of the salary schedule. Unlike the County's previous hiring schedule, SOP 1440 does not\n   rely on experience to set an employee's initial salary. SOP 1440 dictated that Rizo be placed at step 1 of level 1 of the hiring schedule, corresponding to a salary of $62,133 for 196 days of work plus a master's degree stipend of $600.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   During a lunch with colleagues in 2012, Rizo learned that her male colleagues had been subsequently hired as math consultants at higher salary steps. In August 2012, she filed a complaint about the pay disparity with the County, which responded that all salaries had been set in accordance with SOP 1440. The County claimed to have reviewed salary-step placements of male and female management employees for the past 25 years (so including before the policy was even informally adopted), finding that SOP 1440 placed more women at higher compensation steps than males. Rizo disputes this analysis and claims that the data show men were placed at a higher average salary step.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Rizo sued Jim Yovino in his official capacity as the Superintendent of the Fresno County Office of Education in February 2014. She claimed a violation of the Equal Pay Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20206\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 206\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d) ; sex discrimination under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e et seq.

It asserted that, although Rizo was paid less than her male counterparts for the same work, the discrepancy was based on Rizo's prior salary. The County contended that her prior salary was a permissible affirmative defense to her concededly lower salary than her male counterparts under the fourth, catchall clause, a \"factor other than sex.\"\n   <em>\n    Rizo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%209260587\">\n    2015 WL 9260587\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *7. The district court denied summary judgment, reasoning that SOP 1440 \"necessarily and unavoidably conflicts with the EPA\" because \"a pay structure based exclusively on prior wages is so inherently fraught with the risk-indeed, here, the virtual certainty-that it will perpetuate a discriminatory wage disparity between men and women that it cannot stand.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *9.

Accordingly, pretext as it is understood in the Title VII context plays no role in Equal Pay Act claims.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Here, the County does not dispute that Rizo established a prima facie case and that none of the three specific statutory exceptions applies. The County urges instead that the fourth catchall exception, \"any other factor other than sex,\" includes an employee's prior salary and applies when her starting salary is based on her prior salary. It acknowledges that if it is wrong, it has no defense to Rizo's Equal Pay Act claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The question in this case is the meaning of the catchall exception. This is purely a question of law. We conclude, unhesitatingly, that \"any other factor other than sex\" is limited to legitimate, job-related factors such as a prospective employee's experience, educational background, ability, or prior job performance. It is inconceivable that Congress, in an Act the primary purpose of which was to eliminate long-existing \"endemic\" sex-based wage disparities, would create an exception for basing new hires' salaries on those very disparities-disparities that Congress declared are not only related to sex but caused by sex. To accept the County's argument would be to perpetuate rather than eliminate the pervasive discrimination at which the Act was aimed. As explained later in this opinion, the language, legislative history, and purpose of the Act make it clear that Congress was not so benighted. Prior salary, whether considered alone or with other factors, is not job related and thus does not fall within an exception to the Act that allows employers to pay disparate wages. Reflecting the very essence of the Act, we hold that by relying on prior salary, the County fails as a matter of law to set forth an affirmative defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Allowing an employer to justify a wage differential between men and women on the basis of prior salary is wholly inconsistent with the provisions of the Equal Pay Act.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   As the Supreme Court has emphasized, \"[t]he Equal Pay Act is broadly remedial, and it should be construed and applied so as to fulfill the underlying purposes which Congress sought to achieve.\"\n   <em>\n    Corning\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1520003\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/417/188/#p195\">\n    417 U.S. at 208\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1520003\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/417/188/#p195\">\n    94 S.Ct. 2223\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The remedial purpose of the Act is clear: to put an end to historical wage discrimination against women. Representative Florence Dwyer said in support of the bill: \"The issue here is really a very simple one-the\n   <em>\n    elimination\n   </em>\n   of one of the most persistent and obnoxious forms of discrimination which is still practiced in this enlightened society.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Representative Harold Donohue in his comments on the bill stressed a similar point: \"[T]his measure represents the\n   <em>\n    correction\n   </em>\n   of basic injustice being visited upon women in many fields of endeavor....\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   In other words, the Equal Pay Act was not intended to be a passive\n   measure but a proactive one designed to correct salary structures based on the \"outmoded belief\" that women should be paid less than men.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Corning\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1520003\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/417/188/#p195\">\n    417 U.S. at 195\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1520003\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/417/188/#p195\">\n    94 S.Ct. 2223\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting S.

At the time of the passage of the Act, an employee's prior pay would have reflected a discriminatory marketplace that valued the equal work of one sex over the other. Congress simply could not have intended to allow employers to rely on these discriminatory wages as a justification for continuing to perpetuate wage differentials.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Today we express a general rule and do not attempt to resolve its applications under all circumstances.

The Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Corning\n   </em>\n   did not find the Act clear on its face. Rather, that decision applied an analytical framework similar to the one we use here by looking to the history of the legislative process of the Equal Pay Act as well as the context in which the Act was adopted.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1520003\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/417/188/#p195\">\n    417 U.S. at 198-203\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1520003\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/417/188/#p195\">\n    94 S.Ct. 2223\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Industry representatives testified at the congressional subcommittee hearings that the two exceptions in the bills that had been introduced in the House and Senate were too specific and under inclusive, and \"evidence[d] ... a lack of understanding of industrial reality.\"\n   <em>\n    Equal Pay Act: Hearings Before the H. Special Subcomm. on Labor of the H. Comm. on Educ. &amp; Labor on H.R. 3861, 4269, and Related Bills\n   </em>\n   , 88th Cong. 135 (1963) [hereinafter\n   <em>\n    House Hearing\n   </em>\n   ] (statement of the American Retail Federation). The witnesses were concerned that companies would no longer be able to rely on the wide variety of factors used across industries to measure the value of a particular job. Accordingly, the witnesses proposed a series of job-related exceptions in addition to the two original exceptions that had covered only seniority and merit systems.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Chief among those was an exception for job classification programs. The Vice President of Owens-Illinois Glass Co. testified: \"Job classification and wage incentive programs are so widely accepted ... in American industry that there seems little need to set forth a lengthy list of reasons why they should be excepted from the present bill.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 101 (statement of W. Boyd Owen, Vice President of Personnel Administration, Owens-Illinois Glass Co.). Bona fide job classification programs were necessarily job related because they were used to \"establish relative job worth\" in diverse industries, \"each [of which] has its own peculiarities and its own customs.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 238 (statement of E.G. Hester, Director of Industrial Relations Research, Corning Glass Works). Using factors like skill and responsibility, these classification programs were \"a yardstick against which [employers] can measure work performance and consequently pay.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 146 (statement of John G. Wayman, Partner, Reed, Smith, Shaw &amp; McClay). The Owens-Illinois Glass representative, Mr. Owen, explained that his proposed exceptions based on job classification and wage incentive programs would \"merely parallel\" the existing exceptions for seniority and merit systems,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 101, both of which were themselves job related.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Most of the other exceptions urged by industry witnesses were also job related. Mr. Owen, for example, explained that there are \"countless reasons for wage variations ... which are not discriminatory in nature,\" including differences in \"the shift or time of day worked, in the regularity of performing duties, [and] in training.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 100. The statement of the American Retail Federation likewise explained: \"It is a wholly justifiable fact that in retailing there are many situations where there are differentials in wage scales based on experience, hours worked (day or evening), job\n   hazards, physical requirements, and the like.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 135.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   We think it plain that the catchall exception was added to the final Equal Pay Act in direct response to these employers' concerns that their legitimate, job-related means of setting pay would not be covered under the two exceptions already included in the bill.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   Following the hearings, Representative Edith Green introduced H.R. 6060, which added the exceptions for \"a differential based on any other factor other than sex\" as well as \"a system which measures earnings by quantity or quality of production.\" H.R. 6060, 88th Cong. \u00a7 2(d)(1) (1963). In its report discussing H.R. 6060, the House Committee explained that \"a bona fide job classification program that does not discriminate on the basis of sex will serve as a valid defense to a charge of discrimination.\" H.R. Rep. No. 88-309, at 3 (1963),\n   <em>\n    as\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    reprinted in\n   </em>\n   1963 U.S.C.C.A.N. 687, 689. The Committee also provided an illustrative list of other factors in addition to job classification programs which would be covered under the fourth exception, the catchall provision: \"[A]mong other things, shift differentials, restrictions on or differences based on time of day worked, hours of work, lifting or moving heavy objects, differences based on experience, training, or ability would also be excluded.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In the end, Representative Robert Griffin, author of the Landrum-Griffin Act, the landmark labor-relations legislation, put it best. Describing the catchall exception, he said, \"Roman numeral iv is a broad principle, and those preceding it are really examples.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The Senate Committee Report likewise confirms that Congress intended the catchall exception to cover factors other than sex only insofar as they were job related. Following the hearings, Senator Patrick McNamara introduced S. 1409, which removed reference to seniority and merit systems and instead included just one statutory exception that was virtually identical to the Act's catchall exception. S. 1409, 88th Cong. \u00a7 2(d)(1) (1963). That exception read, \"except where such a wage differential is based on any factor or factors other than sex.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In its report, the Senate Committee provided illustrative examples of what this general exception would cover: \"seniority systems ... based on tenure,\" \"merit system[s],\" \"piecework system[s] which measure[ ] either the quantity or quality of production or performance,\" and \"[w]ithout question,\" \"other valid classification programs....\" S.

In sum, so long as the employer proves that it is using a bona fide job classification system or otherwise relying on bona fide job-related factors to set pay, courts will not second guess the merits of the particular method used. Courts have followed the\n   <em>\n    Gunther\n   </em>\n   mandate. They have not held, for example, that it would be more appropriate to value educational background over years of experience when setting salaries or that job training should outweigh demonstrated ability to do the job.\n   <em>\n    Gunther\n   </em>\n   thus implicitly endorsed the bargain struck in the Equal Pay Act: employers may continue to use their legitimate, job-related means of setting pay but may not use sex directly or indirectly as a basis for establishing employees' wages.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <strong>\n    3.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   We are not the only federal court of appeals to construe the catchall exception as limited to job-related factors.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Eleventh Circuit, for example, has concluded that \"the 'factor other than sex' exception applies when the disparity results from unique characteristics of the same job; from an individual's experience, training, or ability ...\"-in other words, job-related reasons.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Glenn\n   </em>\n   , 841 F.2d at 1571. Although some courts occasionally use \"job-related\" and terminology like \"business-related\" or \"legitimate business reason[s]\" interchangeably, we believe that it is neither helpful nor advisable to do so.

Remanding the case to the district court, however, the Second Circuit was clear in its instructions: the employer could justify the wage differential \"\n   <em>\n    only if the employer proves that the [factor relied on] is job-related\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 527 (emphasis added).\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Including \"business-related\" as a legitimate basis for exceptions under the catchall provision would permit the use of far too many improper justifications for avoiding the strictures of the Act.

First, a factor other than sex\n   <em>\n    must\n   </em>\n   be one that is job related, rather than one that \"effectuates some business policy.\" Second, it is impermissible to rely on prior salary to set initial wages. Prior salary is not job related and it perpetuates the very gender-based assumptions about the value of work that the Equal Pay Act was designed to end. This is true whether prior salary is the sole factor or one of several factors considered in establishing employees' wages. Although some federal courts of appeals allow reliance on prior salary along with other factors while barring reliance on prior salary alone,\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Glenn\n   </em>\n   , 841 F.2d at 1571 &amp; n.9, this is a distinction without reason: we cannot reconcile this distinction with the text or purpose of the Equal Pay Act. Although Judges McKeown and Callahan correctly acknowledge in their concurrences that basing initial salary on an employee's prior salary alone violates the Equal Pay Act, neither offers a rational explanation for their incompatible conclusion that relying on prior salary in addition to one or more other factors somehow is consistent with the Act. Declining to explain the inconsistency of their positions, they simply rely on those who came before-the EEOC and other courts of appeals, which also fail to explain how what is impermissible alone somehow becomes permissible when joined with other factors. For obvious reasons, we cannot agree. Reliance on past wages simply perpetuates the past pervasive discrimination that the Equal Pay Act seeks to eradicate. Therefore, we readily reach the conclusion that past salary may not be used as a factor in initial wage setting, alone or in conjunction with less invidious factors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   <strong>\n    Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Unfortunately, over fifty years after the passage of the Equal Pay Act, the wage gap between men and women is not some inert historical relic of bygone assumptions and sex-based oppression. Although it may have improved since the passage of the Equal Pay Act, the gap persists today: women continue to receive lower earnings than men \"across industries, occupations, and education levels.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"Collectively, the gender wage gap costs women in the U.S. over $840 billion a year.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   If money talks, the message to women costs more than \"just\" billions: women are told they are not worth as much as men. Allowing prior salary to justify a wage differential perpetuates this message, entrenching in salary systems an obvious means of discrimination-the very discrimination that the Act was designed to prohibit and rectify.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   <strong>\n    AFFIRMED AND REMANDED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   McKEOWN, Circuit Judge, with whom MURGUIA, Circuit Judge, joins, concurring:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   For decade after decade, gender discrimination has been baked into our pay\n   scales, with the result that women still earn only 80 percent of what men make. Unfortunately, women employed in certain sectors face an even larger gap. This disparity is exacerbated when a woman is paid less than a man for a comparable job solely because she earned less at her last job. The Equal Pay Act prohibits precisely this kind of \"piling on,\" where women can never overcome the historical inequality.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   I agree with most of the majority opinion-particularly its observation that past salary can reflect historical sex discrimination. But the majority goes too far in holding that any consideration of prior pay is \"impermissible\" under the Equal Pay Act, even when it is assessed with other job-related factors such as experience, education, past performance and training. In my view, prior salary alone is not a defense to unequal pay for equal work. If an employer's only justification for paying men and women unequally is that the men had higher prior salaries, odds are that the one-and-only \"factor\" causing the difference is sex. However, employers do not necessarily violate the Equal Pay Act when they consider prior salary among other factors when setting initial wages. To the extent salary is considered with other factors, the burden is on the employer to show that any pay differential is based on a valid job-related factor other than sex.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   To be sure, the majority correctly decides the only issue squarely before the court: whether the Fresno County Office of Education was permitted to base Aileen Rizo's starting salary solely on her prior salary. The answer is no. But regrettably, the majority goes further and effectively bars any consideration of prior salary in setting a new salary. Not only does Rizo's case not present this issue, but this approach is unsupported by the statute, is unrealistic, and may work to women's disadvantage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Rizo's case is an easy one. After she was hired as a math consultant, she learned that male colleagues in the same job were being hired at a higher salary. The only rationale offered by the County was that Rizo's salary was lower at a prior job. In effect, the County \"was still taking advantage of the availability of female labor to fill its [position] at a differentially low wage rate not justified by any factor other than sex\"-a practice long held unlawful.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Corning Glass Works v.

That, too, is a drastic holding, particularly because companies and institutions often consider prior salary in making offers to lure away top talent from their competitors or to attract employees with specific skills. In unpacking what goes into the calculation, it may well be that salary accurately gauges a prospective employee's \"skill, effort, and responsibility,\" as the Equal Pay Act envisions-in addition to her education, training, and past performance-and a new employer wants to exceed that benchmark. The Equal Pay Act should not be an impediment for employees seeking a brighter future and a\n   higher salary at a new job.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   ORLY LOBEL, TALENT WANTS TO BE FREE 49-75 (Yale Univ.

Labor Code \u00a7 432.3\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Those laws represent creative efforts to narrow the gender wage gap. But they also provide important exemptions for employees who wish to disclose prior salaries as part of a salary negotiation.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%20432.3\">\n    Cal. Labor Code \u00a7 432.3\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g). Although the majority professes that its decision does not relate to negotiated salaries, the principle of the majority's holding may reach beyond these state statutes by making it a violation of federal antidiscrimination law to consider prior salary, even when an employee chooses to provide it as a bargaining chip for higher wages. I am concerned about chilling such voluntary discussions. Indeed, the result may disadvantage rather than advantage women.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   To avoid those consequences, the majority endeavors to limit its decision by announcing that it \"express[es] a general rule and do[es] not attempt to resolve its applications under all circumstances.\" The majority disclaims, for example, deciding \"whether or under what circumstances, past salary may play a role in the course of an individualized salary negotiation.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Maj. Op. at 461. The majority's disclaimer hardly cushions the practical effect of its \"general rule.\" Because the majority makes it \"impermissible to rely on prior salary to set initial wages\" under the Act, it has left little daylight for arguing that negotiated starting salaries should be treated differently than established pay scales.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Maj. Op. at 468. In the real world, an employer \"rel[ies] on prior salary to set initial wages\" when it takes the prior salary offered voluntarily by an employee in negotiations and sets a starting salary above those past wages, even if there is an established pay scale.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   The more limited holding adopted by our sister circuits better accords with common sense and the statutory text. The Equal Pay Act provides an affirmative defense for \"\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   other factor other than sex.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20206\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 206\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(1) (emphasis added). The majority opinion recognizes that \"legitimate, job-related factors such as a prospective employee's experience, educational background, ability, or prior job performance\" operate as affirmative defenses. But the majority nonetheless renders those valid, job-related factors nugatory when an employer also considers prior salary. That is a puzzling outcome.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   For these reasons, I concur in the result, but not the majority's rationale.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   CALLAHAN, Circuit Judge, with whom TALLMAN, Circuit Judge, joins, concurring:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   We all agree that men and women should receive equal pay for equal work regardless of gender. Indeed, we agree that the purpose of the Equal Pay Act of 1963 was to change \"should receive equal pay\" to \"must receive equal pay.\" However, I write separately because in holding that prior salary can never be considered, the majority fails to follow Supreme Court\n   precedent, unnecessarily ignores the realities of business and, in doing so, may hinder rather than promote equal pay for equal work.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   The factual fallacies of the majority opinion are, first, that prior salary is not generally job-related, and second, that prior salary inherently reflects wage discrepancies based on gender. In fact, prior salary is a prominent consideration for both a job applicant and the potential employer. The applicant presumably seeks a job that will pay her more and the potential employer recognizes that it will have to pay her more if it wants to hire her. Of course, a prior salary might reflect a wage discrepancy based on gender, but this does not justify the majority's absolute position.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Prior salary serves, in combination with other factors, to allow employers to set a competitive salary that will entice potential employees to take the job. The majority's approach ignores these economic incentives and appears to demand a lockstep pay system such as is often used in government service.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   We allow private industry more flexibility. In the private sector, basing initial salary upon previous salary, plus other factors such as experience and education, encourages hard work and rewards applicants who have stellar credentials. The majority opinion stifles these economic incentives with a flat prohibition on ever considering prior salary, no matter how enlightened or non-discriminatory it may have been.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Second, the assumption that prior salary inherently reflects gender bias is not true. The majority opinion completely ignores economic disparity in pay for the same jobs performed in different parts of the country, where costs of living are lower and demand for available jobs may exceed the supply of available and highly competitive positions. While there is no question that prior salary in some instances may well reflect gender discrimination, this is not always the case. Historically, differences in prior salaries may simply reflect the differing costs of living in various parts of the country. And the flat prohibition ignores the fact that when the prior salary was set there may well have been more qualified job seekers than there were available jobs to fill.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   As required by the Equal Pay Act, Rizo, at least for the purposes of a motion for summary judgment, made a prima facie case of pay discrimination by showing that (1) she performed substantially equal work to that of her male colleagues; (2) the work conditions were basically the same; and (3) the male employees were paid more.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Riser v.

When a plaintiff makes a prima facie case of pay inequality based on gender, the burden of showing that the difference is not based on gender shifts to the employer. In other words, the prima facie case creates a presumption that the pay inequality arising from the employer's pay system is gender based and hence is not a \"factor other than sex.\" In\n   <em>\n    Corning Glass\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court explained that the Equal Pay Act's\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-104\">\n   structure and history also suggest that once the Secretary has carried his burden of showing that the employer pays workers of one sex more than workers of the opposite sex for equal work, the burden shifts to the employer to show that the differential is justified under one of the Act's four exceptions.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   <em>\n    Corning Glass\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1520003\" index=\"137\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/417/188/#p195\">\n    417 U.S. at 196\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1520003\" index=\"138\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/417/188/#p195\">\n    94 S.Ct. 2223\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Maxwell v.

There is no justification for holding that an employer could, as a matter of law, justify the differential under one of the first three exceptions, but not the fourth exception. Accordingly, I differ from the majority in that I think, as do the majority of our sister circuits, that when salary is established based on a multi-factor salary system that includes prior salary, the presumption that the system is based on gender is rebuttable.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   This is also the position of the EEOC, the agency charged with enforcing the EPA. In its amicus brief, the EEOC states that in its view because prior salaries \"can reflect sex-based compensation discrimination,\" a prior salary \"cannot by itself justify a compensation disparity,\" but \"an employer may consider prior salary as part of a mix of factors.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   That seems a reasonable approach to a multi-faceted decision to formulate a rate of pay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   In sum, I note that \"prior pay\" is not inherently a reflection of gender discrimination. Differences in prior pay may well be based on other factors such as the cost of living in different parts of our country. Also, it is possible, and we hope in this day probable, that the prior employer had adjusted its pay system to be gender neutral. Nonetheless, consistent with the intent of the EPA, I agree that where prior pay is the exclusive determinant of pay, the employer cannot carry its burden of showing that it is a \"factor other than sex.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, neither Congress's intent, nor the language of the Equal Pay Act, nor logic, requires, or justifies, the conclusion that a pay system that includes prior pay as one of several ingredients can never be a \"factor other than sex,\" and thus fails to come within the fourth exception to the Equal Pay Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   IV\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   In this case, the County based pay only on prior salary, and accordingly the district court properly denied it summary judgment. Nonetheless, the majority unnecessarily, incorrectly, and contrary to Supreme Court precedent, insists that prior salary can never be a factor in a pay system that falls within the fourth exception to the Equal Pay Act. Accordingly, I concur separately because following the Supreme Court's guidance, I agree with the Tenth and Eleventh Circuits, as well as the EEOC, the agency charged with enforcing the EPA, that prior pay may be a component of a pay system that comes within the fourth exception recognized in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"140\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20206\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 206\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(1). A defense to a pay discrimination claim will lie if the employer meets its burden of showing that its system does not perpetuate or create a pay differential based on sex. We should not have reached out to hold otherwise, particularly as there was no need to do so.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   For these reasons, I concur in the result, but not the majority's rationale.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   WATFORD, Circuit Judge, concurring in the judgment:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   I agree with the result the majority reaches, but I arrive there through a somewhat different reading of the statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   The Equal Pay Act prohibits employers from discriminating \"on the basis of sex\" by paying female employees less than their male counterparts for doing the same work.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"141\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20206\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 206\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(1). The Act allows an employer to justify such a pay disparity by proving, as an affirmative defense, that the disparity is based on a \"factor other than sex.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Corning Glass Works v.

In my view, past pay can constitute a \"factor other than sex,\" but only if an employee's past pay is not itself a reflection of sex discrimination. If past pay does reflect sex discrimination, an employer cannot rely on it to justify a pay disparity, whether the employer considers past pay alone or in combination with other factors. I agree with the majority that holding otherwise would permit employers to perpetuate the very form of sex discrimination the Act was intended to outlaw.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   This reading of \u00a7 206(d)(1) aligns with the Supreme Court's interpretation of the same provision in\n   <em>\n    Corning Glass\n   </em>\n   . There, Corning Glass had for many years paid female day-shift inspectors less than male night-shift inspectors, even though both sets of inspectors performed the same work. The company argued that this pay disparity was simply the result of prevailing market forces, which allowed men to demand and receive higher wages than women. The Court rejected that argument and held that the disparity nonetheless violated the Act's requirement of \"equal pay for equal work.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1520003\" index=\"144\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/417/188/#p195\">\n    417 U.S. at 205\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1520003\" index=\"145\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/417/188/#p195\">\n    94 S.Ct. 2223\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   The Court also rejected the company's attempt to defend its new pay system, which eliminated the pay disparity going forward. Beginning in January 1969, all newly hired inspectors would be paid the same wage regardless of shift. The company set the new, uniform wage at an hourly rate above what the day-shift inspectors had been earning but below what the night-shift inspectors made. Existing employees would be paid the new, uniform wage as well, unless they had been earning more beforehand. That meant existing day-shift inspectors got a raise (to the new, uniform wage), but existing night-shift inspectors got to retain their previous, higher wage.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1520003\" index=\"146\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/417/188/#p195\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1520003\" index=\"146\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/417/188/#p195\">\n    at 194\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 208-09 &amp; n.29,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1520003\" index=\"147\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/417/188/#p195\">\n    94 S.Ct. 2223\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Supreme Court held that the resulting pay disparity between female day-shift and male night-shift inspectors' wages was illegal: Although the disparity was attributable to a \"neutral factor other than sex\"-namely, past pay-the employer could not avail itself of the affirmative defense because an employee's past pay in this instance reflected sex discrimination.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1520003\" index=\"148\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/417/188/#p195\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1520003\" index=\"148\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/417/188/#p195\">\n    at 209-10\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1520003\" index=\"149\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/417/188/#p195\">\n    94 S.Ct. 2223\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

If an employer seeks to justify paying women less than men by relying on past pay, it bears the\n   burden of proving that its female employees' past pay is not tainted by sex discrimination, including discriminatory pay differentials attributable to prevailing market forces.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1520003\" index=\"150\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/417/188/#p195\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1520003\" index=\"150\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/417/188/#p195\">\n    at 205\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1520003\" index=\"151\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/417/188/#p195\">\n    94 S.Ct. 2223\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Unfortunately, even today, in most instances that will be exceedingly difficult to do. Despite progress in closing the wage gap, gender pay disparities persist in virtually every sector of the American economy, with women today earning on average only about 82% of what men make, even after controlling for education, work experience, and other factors.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Francine D. Blau &amp; Lawrence M. Kahn,\n   <em>\n    The Gender Wage Gap: Extent, Trends, and Explanations\n   </em>\n   , 55 J. Econ. Literature 789, 797-800 (2017). It therefore remains highly likely that a woman's past pay will reflect, at least in part, some form of sex discrimination. As a result, an employer will rarely be able to justify a gender pay disparity by relying on the fact that a female employee made less than her male counterparts at her prior job.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   The employer in this case failed to prove that Aileen Rizo's past pay is not tainted by sex discrimination. Her prior salary thus cannot be deemed a \"factor other than sex.\" For that reason, I agree that the district court properly denied the County's motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-121\">\n    109 Cong.

The structure of Title VII litigation, including presumptions, burdens of proof, and defenses, has been designed to reflect this approach. The fourth affirmative defense of the Equal Pay Act, however, was designed differently, to confine the application of the Act to wage differentials attributable to sex discrimination. H.R. Rep. No. 309, 88th Cong., 1st Sess., 3 (1963), U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1963, p. 687. Equal Pay Act litigation, therefore, has been structured to permit employers to defend against charges of discrimination where their pay differentials are based on a bona fide use of \"other factors other than sex.\" Under the Equal Pay Act, the courts and administrative agencies are not permitted to \"substitute their judgment for the judgment of the employer ... who [has] established and applied a bona fide job rating system,\" so long as it does not discriminate on the basis of sex. 109 Cong.Rec. 9209 (1963) (statement of Rep. Goodell, principal exponent of the Act). Although we do not decide in this case how sex-based wage discrimination litigation under Title VII should be structured to accommodate the fourth affirmative defense of the Equal Pay Act, see n. 8, supra, we consider it clear that the Bennett Amendment, under this interpretation, is not rendered superfluous.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-149\">\n    <em>\n     Washington Cty.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1313717\" index=\"180\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/452/161/\">\n     452 U.S. at 170-71\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1313717\" index=\"181\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/452/161/\">\n     101 S.Ct. 2242\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (footnote omitted).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-150\">\n    This conclusion is further supported by a footnote in the Court's decision, which states:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-151\">\n    The legislative history of the Equal Pay Act was examined by this Court in\n    <em>\n     Corning Glass Works v.

The Court observed that earlier versions of the Equal Pay bill were amended to define equal work and to add the fourth affirmative defense because of a concern that bona fide job-evaluation systems used by American businesses would otherwise be disrupted.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1520003\" index=\"185\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/417/188/#p195\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    , at 199-201,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1520003\" index=\"186\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/417/188/#p195\">\n     94 S.Ct. at 2230-2231\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . This concern is evident in the remarks of many legislators.
