BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Petitioner has lived in the United States since 1990 as a lawful permanent resident. As a teenager, he developed symptoms of a serious mental disability and was diagnosed with schizophrenia, for which he began receiving treatment. He has taken medication for his mental illness for the vast majority of his life.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In 2004, Petitioner pled guilty to assault with a deadly non-firearm weapon in violation of California Penal Code \u00a7 245(a)(1) for physically assaulting a storeowner by swinging a weightlifting bell, which grazed the top of the storeowners' head and resulted in an injury requiring stitches. During the criminal proceedings, the storeowner testified that after tackling Petitioner he \"noticed that [Petitioner] was not all there.\" Gomez-Sanchez was sentenced to the two-year statutory minimum. Subsequently, he was charged with removability under the Immigration and Nationality Act (\"INA\") as an alien convicted of an aggravated felony. Immigration and Nationality Act \u00a7 237(a)(2)(A)(iii),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201227\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2)(A)(iii).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On January 8, 2010 Petitioner filed an application for withholding of removal and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\"CAT\"), contending that he would be subject to persecution or torture in Mexico due to his chronic mental illness, would lack access to medication and psychiatric treatment in Mexico, and would be subject to deplorable conditions in Mexican public psychiatric hospitals and/or prisons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The IJ found that Petitioner was ineligible for withholding of removal because he had been convicted of a particularly serious crime. She noted that that \"[b]y its nature, swinging a weight bell at a person's head is a dangerous act capable of causing grave injuries,\" and that indeed the storeowner had received several stitches as a result of being struck. These facts, in conjunction with Petitioner's two-year sentence and the fact that his \"conviction arose from the physical assault on a\n   person,\" led the IJ to conclude his offense was particularly serious.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Mr. Gomez-Sanchez timely appealed to the BIA, challenging the finding that he could not seek withholding of removal because he had been convicted of a particularly serious crime. On July 17, 2014 a three-member panel of the BIA issued a published decision holding that \"a person's mental health is not a factor to be considered in a particularly serious crime analysis and that adjudicators are constrained by how mental health issues were addressed as part of the criminal proceedings.\"\n   <em>\n    Matter of G-G-S-,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20I.%20%26%20N.%20Dec.%20339\">\n    26 I. &amp; N. Dec. 339\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 339 (BIA 2014).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Board, while sympathizing with Petitioner's significant mental health struggles, stated that based on its \"assessment of the nature of [Petitioner's] conviction, the prison sentence imposed, and the circumstances of his offense\" the IJ was correct in finding that Petitioner's conviction for assault with a deadly weapon was for a particularly serious crime. Specifically, the Board noted that \"`crimes against persons' are more likely to be categorized as particularly serious crimes.\" The Board then concluded \"[t]his was a dangerous act capable of causing grave injuries,\" whose gravity \"is also reflected in his 2-year sentence to prison.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Board explained that \"consideration of an alien's mental health as a factor in the criminal act falls within the province of the criminal courts,\" and that \"[w]hether and to what extent an [alien's] mental illness or disorder is relevant to his or her commission of an offense and conviction for the crime are issues best resolved in criminal proceedings by the finders of fact.\" The Board further pointed out that issues concerning an individual's mental condition can be raised in criminal proceedings at various stages. Thus, the Board reasoned that it \"cannot go behind the decisions of the criminal judge and reassess any ruling on criminal culpability.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   According to the Board, Petitioner's \"claim that his violent act was a result of his mental illness does not lessen the danger that his actions posed to others and is therefore not relevant to [its] determination that his offense is a particularly serious crime.\" Although assault with a deadly weapon under the California statute at issue in this case is a general intent crime, the Board concluded that the fact that no specific intent to injure another is required \"does not diminish the dangerousness of [the] acts committed in violation of this statute.\" To the contrary, the Board concluded that assault with a deadly weapon is an \"inherently dangerous offense\" warranting a finding that Petitioner is a danger to the community, \"even if he did not intend to commit a particularly serious crime.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Petitioner timely petitioned for review of the BIA decision.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201252\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    II. STANDARD OF REVIEW AND CHEVRON DEFERENCE\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Mr. Gomez-Sanchez contends that the Board committed legal error in interpreting the INA to establish the categorical rule that mental health can never be considered in determining whether a conviction constitutes a particularly serious crime. \"Whether the BIA applied the proper legal standard in determining whether [Petitioner's] crime was `particularly serious' raises a question of law.\"\n   <em>\n    Blandino-Medina\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    v.

The Board assumes that undertaking its own consideration of mental health-related evidence would undermine the criminal court's findings by requiring the Board to \"reassess\" those findings. This assumption is faulty on several fronts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   First, consideration of mental health-related evidence, like consideration of other underlying facts and circumstances surrounding a crime, does not require IJs to assess criminal culpability or the validity of the conviction.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Rather, IJs may consider this evidence, where reliable, as part of the separate determination of dangerousness. The IJ is not retrying the question of guilt but assessing whether the circumstances of the crime are so serious as to justify removal to a country where there is a significant risk of persecution.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Therefore, an IJ, as a fact finder focused on that question, may choose to examine what he\n   or she deems reliable evidence of mental health and decide whether such evidence bears on the dangerousness determination, and ultimately whether the individual committed a particularly serious crime, without disturbing, or \"reassessing\" the criminal court's findings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Second, the Board's concerns about \"going behind\" a conviction are unreasonable given that, pursuant to various provisions of the INA, IJs regularly scrutinize the factual circumstances surrounding crimes of conviction. Indeed, in the Board's published decision issued just two months after its decision in this case, the Board noted that inquiries into the factual circumstances surrounding a crime \"are by no means unusual in removal proceedings.\"\n   <em>\n    See Matter of Dominguez-Rodriguez,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20I.%20%26%20N.%20Dec.%20408\">\n    26 I. &amp; N.

Although it clarified that \"an inquiry regarding evil intent or fraud is not necessarily dispositive,\" the Board's acknowledgement that an individual's \"evil intent\" might bear on the particularly serious crime determination inherently contradicts its conclusion that mental condition is never relevant to that analysis, especially given that Respondent does not dispute that an individual's mental illness might impact his or her intent.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=22%20I.%20%26%20N.%20Dec.%20949\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Thus, it necessarily follows that an individual's mental health could be relevant to the determination of whether a crime is particularly serious, contrary to the Board's reasoning here.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   We accordingly find the Board's rationale - that evidence of an individual's mental condition at the time he or she committed the crime of conviction is categorically irrelevant - is unreasonable.\n   <em>\n    See Marmolejo-Campos,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3358453\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/558/903/\">\n    558 F.3d at 920\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   It is irrebuttably presumed that once a crime is determined to be particularly serious, the individual who committed that crime presents a danger to the community such that he or she is not entitled to protection by this country from persecution in another country. Given this narrow focus and in light of this severe consequence, the Agency must take all reliable, relevant information into consideration when making its determination, including the defendant's mental condition at the time of the crime, whether it was considered during the criminal proceedings or not. This ensures that the Agency will in fact examine the circumstances of each conviction individually, taking into account all of the circumstances, as required under the case-by-case approach.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Because the Board's rule in this case conflicts with these principles, we find that the Agency's interpretation is unreasonable and not entitled to deference under\n   <em>\n    Chevron.\n   </em>\n   For the foregoing reasons, we vacate and remand to the BIA for further proceedings consistent with this decision.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   <strong>\n    Petition GRANTED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"**.\">\n   <p id=\"p-72\">\n    This case was submitted to a panel that included Judge Kozinski, who recently retired.
