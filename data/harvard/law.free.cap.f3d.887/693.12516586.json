Specifically, the question is whether Ramirez's convictions for obstruction of justice pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Va.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2018.2-460\">\n    Va. Code Ann. \u00a7 18.2-460\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (A) qualify as crimes involving moral turpitude (CIMTs). We hold that obstruction of justice under \u00a7 18.2-460(A) is not a CIMT because it may be committed without fraud, deception, or any other aggravating element that shocks the public conscience. We therefore grant Ramirez's petition for review, vacate the BIA's order of removal, and remand with directions for the Government to facilitate Ramirez's return to the United States to participate in further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Jose Ramirez, a citizen of El Salvador, first entered the United States in 1996 when he was seventeen years old. Nearly twenty years later, Ramirez was placed in removal proceedings and charged with being present in the United States without being admitted or paroled under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201182\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(6)(A)(i). At his hearing, Ramirez conceded that he had entered the country unlawfully. A.R. 69.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Ramirez then applied for special rule cancellation of removal under section 203 of NACARA, Pub. L. No. 105-100,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=111%20Stat.%202160\">\n    111 Stat. 2160\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 2196-2199 (1997). Section 203 allows certain nationals from El Salvador and other designated countries to apply for suspension of deportation or special rule cancellation of removal and adjust their status to permanent residency.\n   <em>\n    See id\n   </em>\n   . To qualify under NACARA, an alien ordinarily must establish at least seven years of continuous presence in the United States, among other eligibility criteria.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201240.66\">\n    8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1240.66\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2)-(4). However, an applicant who is inadmissible or removable for having committed a CIMT must establish at least\n   <em>\n    ten\n   </em>\n   years of continuous presence after becoming inadmissible or removable.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Matter of Castro-Lopez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20I.%20%26%20N.%20Dec.%20693\">\n    26 I &amp; N Dec. 693\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 693 (BIA 2015) ;\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201240.66\">\n    8 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1240.66\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) and (c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) moved to pretermit Ramirez's application for relief under NACARA, arguing that his prior convictions triggered the ten-year requirement. In 2012, Ramirez was convicted of one count of petit larceny under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Va.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2018.2-96\">\n    Va.

DHS argued that those convictions qualified as CIMTs, thereby subjecting Ramirez to the ten-year physical presence\n   requirement, which he could not meet.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The decision turned on whether the obstruction offenses were CIMTs because petit larceny, which Ramirez conceded was a CIMT, was not independently sufficient to trigger inadmissibility and the heightened ten-year requirement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Immigration Judge (IJ) concluded that obstruction of justice under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Va.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2018.2-460\">\n    Va. Code Ann. \u00a7 18.2-460\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (A) was a CIMT. In a brief oral decision, the IJ reasoned that \"the statute requires an act indicating an intention to prevent an officer from performing his or her duties and that such impairing or obstructing an officer is morally turpitudinous.\" A.R. 64. The IJ then found that Ramirez was removable and did not qualify for relief under section 203 of NACARA. A.R. 65.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In a brief single-member decision, the BIA agreed that obstruction under \u00a7 18.2-460(A) was a CIMT and affirmed. A.R. 3-4. In response, Ramirez filed a motion for a stay of removal with this Court. This Court denied the motion, and Ramirez was removed to El Salvador.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Ramirez filed a timely petition for review with this Court. In his petition, Ramirez argues that the BIA erred in finding that obstruction of justice under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Va.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2018.2-460\">\n    Va. Code Ann. \u00a7 18.2-460\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (A) was a CIMT. Ramirez also asks this Court to order the Government to facilitate his return to the United States. In response, the Government argues that this Court lacks jurisdiction because Ramirez has failed to exhaust his administrative remedies, that the BIA did not err, and that ordering Ramirez's return is unnecessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Before assessing the merits of Ramirez's claims, \"[w]e first consider whether we have jurisdiction\" over his petition for review.\n   <em>\n    Etienne v.

A.R. 31. Instead, the Government argues that administrative exhaustion bars Ramirez's appellate counsel from making more specific and nuanced points to demonstrate how and why obstruction is not a CIMT. In particular, the Government takes issue with appellate counsel citing certain cases for the first time on appeal in order to elaborate on the breadth of the Virginia statute. The Government has not provided any basis for applying the exhaustion requirement at this level of granularity.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Indeed, such an approach would strip appellate counsel's ability to bolster existing arguments-and limit the universe of available case law and precedent to those already cited below.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Massis v.

No decision of this Court has\n   so undermined the basics of appellate advocacy and review, and we, like our sister circuits, decline the Government's invitation to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   We therefore conclude that Ramirez satisfied the exhaustion requirement under \u00a7 1252(d)(1) when he argued below that obstruction of justice is not a CIMT. Accordingly, we have jurisdiction over this question of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   We now turn to the merits of Ramirez's argument. The dispositive issue is whether obstruction of justice under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Va.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2018.2-460\">\n    Va.

In reaching that conclusion, the BIA invoked its precedential decision in\n   <em>\n    Matter of Jurado-Delgado\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=24%20I.%20%26%20N.%20Dec.%2029\">\n    24 I. &amp; N.

Under the well-known\n   <em>\n    Chevron\n   </em>\n   doctrine, an agency's interpretation of the statute(s) that it administers is entitled to deferential review if the agency exercises delegated authority to \"make rules carrying the force of law.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Section 18.2-460(A) does not reference fraud, deception, or any other aggravator needed to qualify as a CIMT. By definition, the provision does not (and cannot) have a divisible version of obstruction that might otherwise qualify as a CIMT. Accordingly, the modified categorical approach has no utility here, and we do not consider whether the statute is otherwise divisible or whether the record of conviction reveals a CIMT.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"10\">\n   <p id=\"p-67\">\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement,\n    <em>\n     Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) on Facilitating Return for Lawfully Removed Aliens\n    </em>\n    (saved as ECF opinion attachment 2) (\"ICE will facilitate your return to the United States if your presence is necessary for continued adjudication of your case.
