The government appeals the grant of the motions to suppress. Concluding the district court correctly distinguished our prior decisions that upheld traffic stops for possible vehicle registration violations, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   At 9:45 p.m. on July 1, 2016, Waterloo, Iowa police officers Kye Richter and Jamie Sullivan, patrolling a high crime neighborhood, observed McLemore standing next to a BMW parked at 820 Logan Avenue, a residence frequented by members of one of two rival gangs. Two days earlier, while investigating reports of a nearby shooting, Sergeant Richter and Officer Diana Del Valle had seen Rode exit the BMW after it stopped near Logan Avenue. Del Valle had learned that Rode was affiliated with the gang that frequented 820 Logan and may have been the victim of an unreported shooting a few days earlier. Richter and Sullivan decided to stop the BMW to investigate these suspicious circumstances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Richter radioed Officer Del Valle, patrolling in a different car, and told her to go to the Logan Avenue area and wait for the BMW to leave. When the BMW departed ten minutes later, Del Valle followed. She saw that the BMW had a dealer advertising plate instead of a rear license plate, which she had noticed two days earlier, and a temporary paper card taped to the inside of the left rear window. Del Valle radioed Richter and Sullivan she had seen \"no violations yet.\" They asked about the card in the back window. Del Valle said, \"you can see a plate, but you can't read what's on it.\" Officer Sullivan replied, \"there you go.\" Del Valle activated the lights on her police cruiser and made an \"equipment\n   stop.\" She testified that she could first read the numbers on the temporary card when \"I got to the trunk area.\" She did not examine whether the temporary card was valid (it was) because \"I already had the probable cause, which was a temporary tag. I wasn't focused on whether that tag was valid or not at that time.\" During the stop, Del Valle smelled marijuana, and Sergeant Richter discovered a firearm during his pat-down search of McLemore.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Both defendants moved to suppress the firearm, raising multiple Fourth Amendment issues. After a combined hearing at which Del Valle and Richter testified, the magistrate judge issued a Report and Recommendation recommending both motions be denied, concluding that the temporary tag issue was controlled by our prior decision in\n   <em>\n    United States v.

We disagree. First, the government's witnesses failed to identify what violation of state law the BMW operator was suspected of committing. The statute primarily at issue,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Iowa%20Code%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20321.25\">\n    Iowa Code \u00a7 321.25\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , provides an exception to the requirement that visible and legible registration plates (commonly called license plates) be securely fastened to the front and back of a motor vehicle:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   A vehicle may be operated upon the highways of [Iowa] without registration plates for a period of forty-five days after the date of delivery of the vehicle to the purchaser from a dealer if a card bearing the words \"registration applied for\" is attached on the rear of the vehicle. The card shall have plainly stamped or stenciled the registration number of the dealer from whom the vehicle was purchased and the date of delivery of the vehicle.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Officer Del Valle, who made the stop, testified that she stopped the BMW for an equipment violation based on the opinion\n   of Officer Sullivan (\"there you go\"), who could not see the BMW and did not testify at the hearing. Del Valle justified the stop because she \"could not see the numbers or letters on [the] temporary registration tag which the DOT requires\" from her police cruiser. However, she knew the BMW had a car dealer's advertising plate where the rear license plate is customarily attached, and she knew the piece of paper taped to the rear window was a temporary Iowa registration \"plate\" in the form approved by the Iowa DOT. Indeed, in her Incident Report written the day after the stop, Officer Del Valle wrote, \"I observed the BMW had promotional/advertising dealer plates and I observed a paper plate affixed to the left portion of the rear window, but I was unable to see the letters or numbers on the paper plate from my vehicle.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Del Valle also did not identify what information she could not see that gave her (or Officer Sullivan) reasonable suspicion of a violation. If her reference to \"letters or numbers\" meant the unique\n   <em>\n    vehicle\n   </em>\n   registration letters and numbers on a license plate, which law enforcement officers often use to identify specific vehicles, then she had no reasonable suspicion at all, because \u00a7 321.25 only requires disclosure of \"the registration number of the dealer from whom the vehicle was purchased and the date of delivery of the vehicle.\" If she meant the\n   <em>\n    dealer's\n   </em>\n   registration number, she did not explain why she needed to see that when she could plainly see a dealer's advertising plate in the BMW's license plate location. If she meant the expiration date-and nothing in the record even hints at that-neither Del Valle nor Richter testified as to their basis for believing that the requirement in \u00a7 321.25 that this information be \"plainly stamped or stenciled\" on the temporary card meant that, unless it is readable at night from a pursuing police cruiser, the vehicle is likely breaking the law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Second, the government did not introduce into evidence either the temporary registration card taped to the rear window when the BMW was seized, or a copy of the standard-form Iowa DOT temporary card to which Del Valle referred in her testimony. Thus, the only evidence of record is Del Valle's contemporaneous opinion that the paper card she saw was a form of card that complied with \u00a7 321.25. Indeed, the government does not dispute that the temporary card satisfied the requirements of Iowa law. Third, neither Sergeant Richter nor Officer Del Valle testified that they can usually read temporary cards at night or that they had previous problems with fraudulent or invalid cards. These facts distinguish this case from facts we deemed \"critical\" in\n   <em>\n    Sanchez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Mendoza\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    Givens\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   As the district court recognized, the government's position in this case would mean that an Iowa police officer may stop a vehicle displaying a proper form of temporary registration card\n   <em>\n    whenever\n   </em>\n   the officer cannot read the dealer registration number and the card's expiration date from inside the officer's following police cruiser.

The court\n   concluded the officer \"had no suspicion at all\" that the defendant was breaking the law; it was dark, both cars were moving, and there was no evidence the \"tag was illegible or in any way obliterated, smudged, or faded.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11458821\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/205/720/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11458821\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/205/720/\">\n    at 723\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court noted that permitting a traffic stop under such circumstances would permit police officers to randomly stop any car with a temporary tag. \"The Fourth Amendment does not allow a policeman to stop a car just because it has temporary tags.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11458821\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/205/720/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11458821\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/205/720/\">\n    at 724\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Likewise, in\n   <em>\n    State v. Carmody\n   </em>\n   , the Iowa Court of Appeals reversed the denial of a motion to suppress where the officer following defendant's car could see it had a temporary tag but \"couldn't make out the markings on it.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%205949621\">\n    2013 WL 5949621\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *2,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=841%20N.W.2d%20356\">\n    841 N.W.2d 356\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Table) (Iowa App. 2013) (\"our jurisprudence does not recognize an unbridled cart blanche authority on the part of officers to make random investigatory traffic stops,\" citing\n   <em>\n    Prouse\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6187389\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/440/648/#p663\">\n    440 U.S. at 661\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6187389\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/440/648/#p663\">\n    99 S.Ct. 1391\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). We agree with these decisions and conclude, like the district court, that\n   <em>\n    Wilson\n   </em>\n   , not\n   <em>\n    Givens\n   </em>\n   , is the governing authority.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The government alternatively asserts that even if Officer Del Valle did not have reasonable suspicion to stop the BMW, she was acting under an objectively reasonable mistake of law in believing that her inability to read the card was a violation of Iowa law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Heien\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12593411\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/530/#p536\">\n    135 S.Ct. at 539\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Though the government did not make this argument to the district court, it was arguably encompassed by the Fourth Amendment issues debated before the magistrate judge and the district court. But even if not forfeited, the argument that the officers made a reasonable mistake of Iowa law is without merit: (a) it is not reasonable to construe the requirement of \"plainly stamped or stenciled\" information in \u00a7 321.25 as meaning information that can be read from a pursuing officer's police cruiser; and (b) the Iowa Court of Appeals decision in\n   <em>\n    Carmody\n   </em>\n   is directly contrary authority.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

On the other hand, if the government is arguing that Officer Del Valle (or Officer Sullivan) reasonably believed there was reasonable suspicion to make a traffic stop, \"mistakes about the requirements of the Fourth Amendment violate the Fourth Amendment even when they are reasonable.\"\n   <em>\n    Heien\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12593411\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/530/#p536\">\n    135 S.Ct. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   541 n.1 (Kagan, J., concurring, quoting the Solicitor General's\n   <em>\n    amicus\n   </em>\n   brief).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   We affirm the Order of the district court in the consolidated criminal cases dated February 28, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-32\">\n    The Honorable Leonard T.
