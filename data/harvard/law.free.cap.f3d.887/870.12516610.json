We consider here Lisa and Anthony (\"A.J.\") Demaree's contention that social workers Laura Pederson and Amy Van Ness violated their constitutional rights to family unity and companionship, and their small children's as well, by removing the children from home without a warrant or court order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   A.J. Demaree dropped off some family photos to be printed at a Wal-Mart in Arizona on Friday, August 29, 2008. While developing the pictures, an employee noticed that several pictures portrayed nude children. Wal-Mart called the police. Detective John Krause came and collected the pictures. On Saturday, he photocopied the ones that concerned the Wal-Mart employee and went to the Demarees' home.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Once there, he and his partner separately interviewed parents Lisa and A.J. Demaree. Both parents looked at the pictures, identified their daughters-five-year-old T.D., four-year-old J.D., and one-and-a-half-year-old L.D.-and said the pictures had been taken \"in the last couple of months\" by one or both parents. When asked what he would do with one photo, which portrayed his three children lying down on a towel nude, focusing on their exposed buttocks but with some genitalia showing, he responded, \"I'm not going to do anything with that one. That's not going in a photo album; that's just one we have.\" Krause said, \"Obviously you're not going to share it with somebody, I would hope,\" to which A.J. responded, \"No, absolutely not!\" Krause then asked why he would take the photo in the first place, and A.J. responded, \"So when we look back on em years later, look at their cute little butts.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   None of the photographs portrayed children engaged in sexual activity. None portrayed the children's genitalia frontally.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   After the interviews, the detectives took T.D., J.D., and L.D. to forensic and medical exams to investigate possible sexual abuse. The physical exams came back normal for all three children. After the interviews were finished, Krause's partner dropped the children back off with their parents. Krause wrote in his report, \"[a]pparently after the forensic interviews and medical exams were completed, [Child Protective Services] declined to remove the children from the parent's custody, and had directed [his partner] to return the girls to Lisa and A.J.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   While the exams were in progress, the police department requested and received a warrant to search the Demarees' home. Executing the warrant, the department seized all the evidence that might be relevant to a child pornography investigation: computers, printers, photographs, cell phones, undeveloped film, floppy discs, DVDs, CDs, VHS tapes, and cameras.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   As the home search was nearing its end, and after the children had been returned to their parents, Child Protective Services (\"CPS\") investigating officer Laura Pederson called one of the police officers to discuss the case. After the conversation, she decided to drive over to the house. There, Pederson discussed with Krause the evidence seized, the content of the pictures, and Krause's expectation that felony child sexual exploitation charges would be brought against both parents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   After reviewing the evidence Krause showed her, Pederson decided to take the children into emergency temporary custody, without obtaining a court order or a warrant. She later said, \"I was relying on the fact that ... at the time there was a pending criminal investigation with both parents named as suspects. I was relying on information that Krause obtained during the investigation ... his opinion of the criminal acts that were committed, my viewing of the pictures and the fact that the-all of this suggested these children\n   were at risk of further exploitation.\" She discussed her recommendation with her supervisor, Amy Van Ness, who agreed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Pederson gave the parents a \"Temporary Custody Notice.\" In that notice, in the space provided for investigators to \"[c]heck the circumstances (\n   <em>\n    imminent risk\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    factor\n   </em>\n   ) that most clearly describes the reason temporary custody was necessary,\" Pederson checked \"[o]ther,\" and wrote, \"mother &amp; father have taken sexually explicit pictures of all three children.\" She did not check the box for situations where \"[t]he child's caregiver has engaged in sexual conduct with a child, or has allowed the child to participate in sexual activity with others.\" On the next page, in the space provided for investigators to inform parents of the \"complaint or allegation concerning [their] family [that] is currently under investigation,\" she wrote, \"Sexual Abuse-child pornography/exploitation.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Pederson then drove T.D. and J.D. to one foster home and L.D. to another. Two days later, Pederson brought the children to their grandparents' home, where all three stayed for about a month, after which they were returned to their parents. The juvenile court never adjudicated the children abused or neglected, and neither A.J. nor Lisa were arrested or charged with any crime.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   A.J. and Lisa later filed the instant action on behalf of themselves and their children, alleging violations of various constitutional rights. The district court dismissed the claims against all defendants except Krause, Pederson, and Van Ness. The Demarees later settled their claims against Krause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   As relevant here, the district court granted summary judgment in favor of Pederson and Van Ness based on qualified immunity. It ordered the parties to propose appropriate redactions to the summary judgment order, which was temporarily filed under seal on April 23, 2014. On May 21, the Demarees requested leave to file under seal a motion to alter or amend the judgment under Federal Civil Rule 59. Six days later, the district court denied the motion for leave to file under seal, and also denied the Demarees' request to seal the summary judgment order in its entirety. The Demarees filed this appeal on June 23.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    II. DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Timeliness of the Appeal\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Before we address the merits, we consider whether this appeal is timely. Three court rules are pertinent to our inquiry here: First, Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 4(a)(4)(A) tolls the deadline to file a notice of appeal upon the timely filing of certain motions, including a motion to alter or amend the judgment under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 59, such that the time to appeal-here, 30 days-runs \"from the entry of the order disposing of the last such remaining motion.\" Second, Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 5(d)(2) provides that \"[a] paper is filed by delivering it ... to the clerk.\" And third, Arizona Local Rule 5.6(c) requires a document meant to be filed under seal first to \"be lodged with the Court in electronic form\" using the electronic filing system.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The Demarees accordingly \"lodged\" a copy of their Rule 59 motion and requested leave to file it under seal. The district court denied the request. But its order, although in form a denial of the request to file the motion under seal, did not refer to or discuss any of the factors relevant to filing documents under seal.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Foltz v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9114614\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/331/1122/#p1135\">\n    331 F.3d 1122\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1135 (9th Cir. 2003). Instead, the order addressed only the merits of the Rule 59 motion, denying the request to file under seal because the underlying motion\n   was \"unnecessary\" and \"a repeat of arguments previously made, at great length, in Plaintiffs' filings.\" The Demarees filed their Notice of Appeal twenty-seven days after the issuance of the order denying leave to file their Rule 59 motion under seal, and fifty-five days after the summary judgment order. Pederson and Van Ness contend that the Demarees' appeal was not timely because the Rule 59 motion was never actually filed and therefore could not toll the deadline for appeal under Rule 4(a)(4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     (i) Jurisdiction versus mandatory claim-processing\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The parties describe the timeliness issue as jurisdictional. Under a recent Supreme Court case, it is not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \"[A]n appeal filing deadline prescribed by statute will be regarded as 'jurisdictional'.... But a time limit prescribed only in a court-made rule ... is not jurisdictional; it is, instead, a mandatory claim-processing rule....\"\n   <em>\n    Hamer v. Neighborhood Hous.

There, Escobedo delivered her complaint to the clerk's office sixty-nine days after receiving her right-to-sue letter from the EEOC. 787 F.3d at 1227. She also filed an\n   <em>\n    in forma pauperis\n   </em>\n   application, which was later denied, and she paid her filing fee by the deadline imposed by the court, which fell 133 days after she received the right-to-sue letter.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1230. The defendant argued that the complaint was time-barred because it was \"filed\" after the ninety-day statutory deadline, even though it was originally submitted to the clerk within the time limit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The district court dismissed the lawsuit, and we reversed, holding that \"[a]s with other pleadings and papers, a complaint is filed 'by delivering it ... to the clerk.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1232-33 (quoting Fed.

There was no allegation that A.J. and Lisa were likely to put their children at risk of sexual assault or abuse; indeed, after the children were professionally evaluated for signs of sexual abuse, Detective Krause reported that \"neither could provide any information relevant to the investigation,\" and Detective Shearer stated that \"[T.D.] and [J.D.] did not make disclosures in the forensic interviews.\" At the end of the evaluations, Detective Krause reported that \"[Child Protective Services] declined to remove the children from the parent's custody [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ], and ... directed Detective Shearer to return the girls to Lisa and A.J.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Nor did Pederson act on fear of physical sexual abuse. Before removing the children, Pederson filled out a \"Temporary Custody Notice,\" which included a space instructing investigators to \"[c]heck the circumstances (\n   <em>\n    imminent risk factor\n   </em>\n   ) that most clearly describes the reason temporary custody was necessary.\" She did not check the box for situations where \"[t]he child's caregiver has engaged in sexual conduct with a child, or has allowed the child to participate in sexual activity with others.\" Instead, Pederson checked \"[o]ther,\" and wrote, \"mother &amp; father have taken sexually explicit pictures of all three children.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Further, any cognizable risk could not have been imminent in the sense our case law requires-that the children \"might again be beaten or molested during the time it would take to get a warrant.\"\n   <em>\n    Rogers\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6046099\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/487/1288/#p1294\">\n    487 F.3d at 1294-95\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The defendants did not suggest that there was any possible harm of the requisite sort to the children before the juvenile courts would reopen after the holiday. Again, there was no evidence of sexual assault or abuse; the defendants did not and do not rely on the children's forensic examination and interview as indicating otherwise.

First, the district court properly protected the privacy of the children by maintaining under seal any motions or exhibits containing their full names or identifying information. Second, Arizona law prohibits the Department of Economic Security from releasing \"files that contain information related to investigations conducted by child protective services.\" Ariz. Rev.

In short, the district court did not violate Arizona law by publishing the order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Finally, the district court order employed clinical, anatomically correct language to briefly describe the nudity depicted in the photographs at issue. The unquantifiable odds that an unsavory individual might find this language titillating does not create a compelling reason for removing it from the public record-especially since the Demarees did not file their Complaint under seal, and in fact gave public interviews in which they, themselves, described the photos and the nudity depicted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

Further, the plaintiffs in those cases each sought to file their complaint\n   <em>\n    as is\n   </em>\n   , not under seal, or if the motion to seal was denied, revised so as to protect the information they initially sought to place under seal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   Here, the Demarees understood that the motion was\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   actually before the court. The Arizona District Court's local rules (AZ LR) specifically require a movant seeking to file a document under seal to\n   <em>\n    file\n   </em>\n   the motion to file under seal and \"[t]he document or documents that are the subject of any such motion or stipulation must not be appended to the motion or stipulation, and must be\n   <em>\n    lodged\n   </em>\n   with the Court separately.\" AZ LR 5.6(b) (emphasis added). The consequences of the court denying a request to file under seal are explicit: \"[i]f a request to file under seal is denied in part or in full, the lodged document will\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   be filed.\" AZ LR 5.6(c) (emphasis added). Further, if the court does deny a request to file under seal, the party has five days to file the motion publicly. AZ LR 5.6(e). There can be no question the Demarees knew their document was not filed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   By seeking to file under seal, it is obvious that the Demarees did\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   want the motion publicly filed. After the District Court rejected the Plaintiffs' motion, it was the Plaintiffs' decision to (1) file publicly;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   (2) revise and file publicly; or (3) not file the motion. It was the Demarees' decision and the local rule respects that right.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   To accord the Plaintiffs \"an out,\" the Majority argues it has authority over this case by giving credence to the fact that the district court comments on the merits of the lodged motion in its denial of the Demarees' motion to seal. In response, the Majority, first, cites no actual legal authority for this argument, because there is none. Second, although the district court discusses the merits of the lodged motion, the ultimate ruling is that the \"Motions to Seal (Doc. 363 and 370) are\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   .\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Third, the Rule 59 motion was never actually before the district court in order for it to consider the motion. The local rule required that the lodged motion \"must\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   be appended to the motion [to seal].\" AZ LR 5.6(b) (emphasis added). Accordingly, the district court could only consider the merits of only the motion to seal because that was the only document before it. Indeed, the lodged document, in essence, disappears if the motion to seal is denied: \"[i]f a request to file under seal is denied in part or in full, the lodged document\n   <em>\n    will not be filed\n   </em>\n   .\" AZ LR 5.6(e) (emphasis added). Although, generally, \"[a] paper is filed by delivering it: (A) to the clerk,\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 5(d)(2)(A), the Demarees did not \"deliver[ ]\" the Rule 59 motion \"to the clerk\" to file it.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4229048\" index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/787/1226/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   By lodging the document, the Demarees explicitly stated they wanted it to remain\n   <em>\n    un\n   </em>\n   filed until the district court granted the motion to seal.

Otherwise, serious injustices may result. In cases of alleged child abuse, governmental failure to abide by constitutional constraints may have deleterious long-term consequences for the child and, indeed, for the entire family.

Assuming, as the majority suggests, that Pederson could have obtained a warrant on a pre-hearing motion for pickup-which neither side argued before the district court-the earliest she could have been heard was the Tuesday following the Labor Day holiday. Against this time line, Pederson had to evaluate the following information:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-123\">\n   \u2022 A Walmart employee was concerned when he discovered photos of naked children on the Demarees' memory stick, and he notified the police;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-124\">\n   \u2022 Krause reviewed the photos, interviewed the parents, served a search warrant at the Demarees' residence, and seized various cameras, computers, film, and other photos;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-125\">\n   \u2022 The children were interviewed and medically examined.

Many types of sexual abuse do not have associated physical findings significant enough to be found on medical exam;\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-127\">\n   \u2022 Krause informed Pederson that at least five of the photos met the statutory definition of sexual exploitation of a minor, and he planned to charge both parents with five felony counts of sexual exploitation of a minor;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-128\">\n   \u2022 Pederson reviewed the edited black and white copies of the photos and determined that the children were nude, with their genitals exposed to the camera, and some of the images appeared posed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   Pederson later explained the significance of her belief that the children (ages five, four, and 19 months) appeared to be posed: \"I would be very concerned if children\n   were posing in provocative manners without clothing on themselves. That would concern me as to what they've observed in their ... home.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   At the time of the removal, then, Pederson knew that there were \"[s]erious allegations of abuse\" against the Demarees, which she investigated and corroborated by reviewing the photos, speaking with Shearer about the results of the forensic interview and medical exams, and conferring with Krause about the potential criminal charges.\n   <em>\n    Rogers\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6046099\" index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/487/1288/#p1294\">\n    487 F.3d at 1294\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

This may not have been the only \"articulable\" risk, in light of the forensic interview report, but the record is clear that Pederson summarily identified the \"sexually explicit pictures\" as the basis for the emergency removal. She also provided the parents with a notice informing them that they were under investigation for \"sexual abuse - child pornography/exploitation.\" Nevertheless, viewing the facts in the light most favorable to the Demarees, a jury could conclude that the children faced no immediate danger of abuse, and it was safe to leave them with their parents over the holiday weekend. Accordingly, that same jury could find that Pederson and Van Ness committed a constitutional violation by removing the children under non-exigent circumstances without a court order.

In that case, the social worker had a court order (albeit one based on \"misrepresentation and omission\") to remove the child, and the defendants conceded there was no imminent danger of abuse.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11581234\" index=\"138\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/191/1306/#p1309\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11581234\" index=\"138\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/191/1306/#p1309\">\n    at 1311-12\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court therefore devoted little consideration to the question of exigency,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11581234\" index=\"139\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/191/1306/#p1309\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 1315 n.5 :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-135\">\n   Our conclusion that disputed facts as viewed by the district court in the light most favorable to plaintiffs-appellees support a conclusion that defendants violated clearly established law by no means restricts the authority of law enforcement and child protective officers to seek protective custody of a child when they have legitimate concerns for the child's safety. Rather, our conclusion hinges upon the district court's finding that \"[d]efendants acknowledged Julie was in no imminent danger at the time they sought the order and the facts suggest\n   it was secured only through distortion, misrepresentation and omission.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   Further, in\n   <em>\n    Malik\n   </em>\n   , the photos at issue were five months old, and the child's uncle, who took the photos, lived out of state. Law enforcement officials had also been in contact with the child's mother and her attorney for about two weeks before seeking a temporary custody order, which supports the conclusion that they did not consider the case an emergency.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   In contrast, in this case, both parents lived in the home and were subjects of an ongoing criminal investigation. They admitted to regularly taking nude photos of the children-in fact, A.J. initially thought Krause wanted to question him about additional photos that were not included in the set obtained from Walmart.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   CPS then became involved less than twenty-four hours after the photos were first discovered, and Pederson, Van Ness, and Krause all agreed that emergency removal was appropriate under the circumstances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   Despite the absence of authority directly on point, the majority concludes that it was nevertheless \"beyond debate\" in 2008 that an emergency removal is only justified to protect a child from \"imminent physical injury or molestation,\" and \"[t]he risk identified here simply does not meet that standard, as it does not involve physical injury or abuse.\" Per curiam Op. at 25-26. I respectfully disagree for two reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   First, framing the issue in this way overlooks another well-established formulation of the standard, one which is quoted earlier in the Opinion: \"Serious allegations of abuse that have been investigated and corroborated\n   <em>\n    usually\n   </em>\n   give rise to a 'reasonable inference of imminent danger sufficient to justify taking children into temporary custody'....\"\n   <em>\n    Rogers\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6046099\" index=\"140\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/487/1288/#p1294\">\n    487 F.3d at 1294\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Ram v. Rubin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"508992\" index=\"141\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/118/1306/#p1310\">\n    118 F.3d 1306\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1311 (9th Cir. 1997) ). In most cases, a serious allegation of abuse may be synonymous with a risk of physical injury. Yet I do not interpret the majority to suggest that allegations of sexual exploitation or child pornography are not \"serious.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   Here, Pederson investigated and corroborated a serious allegation of abuse. True, it did not necessarily involve traditional physical injury. But the record reflects that the nature of the concern-sexually explicit photos-is not limited to snapping a picture. In other words, the potential danger was not that the Demarees would take more\n   <em>\n    naked\n   </em>\n   pictures of the girls; rather, the risk was that the parents were sexually exploiting their children. As Pederson explained, inherent in this allegation is the concern that there is more to the situation than meets the eye-for example, that the parents may have posed the children, or that the children may have adopted provocative poses based on behavior observed in the home. Without the benefit of clearer guidance defining the \"usual\" case, a reasonable social worker could be unsure how to proceed under these circumstances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   Second, the majority treats the nature of the risk and the time required to obtain a warrant as entirely distinct considerations. I do not consider them so easily separated. Ninth Circuit authority in this area rightly focuses on whether the threat to a child's safety is sufficiently \"imminent\" to justify immediate removal, without waiting for court approval.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Kirkpatrick v. Cty. of Washoe\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12173302\" index=\"142\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/843/784/#p789\">\n    843 F.3d 784\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 791 (9th Cir. 2016) (en banc) (\"[T]he social workers here lacked cause to forgo a warrant if they had adequate time to pursue one through the ordinary judicial process without risking [the child's] well-being.\"). This is because in the typical case, judicial review is available \"within hours.\" The analysis therefore naturally focuses on whether the allegations of abuse are both severe and urgent enough that it is unacceptable to allow the child to remain in the home for even a short period of time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   This case is unique: no judicial review was available for at least several days. And this fact is both critical and, perhaps, unlikely to be repeated. As the majority correctly notes, certain allegations of abuse or neglect might lead a reasonable social worker to feel comfortable leaving a child in the custody of his parents for just a few hours.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Rogers\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6046099\" index=\"143\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/487/1288/#p1294\">\n    487 F.3d at 1291\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (bottle rot and other chronic neglect);\n   <em>\n    Mabe\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11167644\" index=\"144\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/237/1101/#p1107\">\n    237 F.3d at 1104-05\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (sexual abuse only taking place at night). But this Court has not had occasion to consider whether those same allegations might be cause for concern if the delay were extended to a few days. No one wants to inflict unnecessary trauma on children,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Concurring Op. of Berzon, J., at 38-39, but surely this worthy consideration must be balanced by protecting their physical well-being in those cases where it is actually threatened. All involved in the child welfare system would be well served by clear legal standards from this Court to assist social workers in making these difficult decisions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   Pederson faced a tough judgment call on that Saturday night: she could err on the side of caution and take the children into temporary custody, or she could wait three days until the courts reopened to seek a removal order. In August 2008, it was clearly established that a child could not be removed from the home without a court order, absent evidence that the child was in imminent danger of abuse.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kirkpatrick\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12173302\" index=\"145\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/843/784/#p789\">\n    843 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   792 (citing cases).
