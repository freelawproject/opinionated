Therefore, we state the facts as alleged in Dixon's liberally-construed complaint, viewed in the light most favorable to him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In 2013, prison officials at Everglades Correctional Institution in Miami assigned an elderly, handicapped inmate to the top bunk in Dixon's cell. This inmate was unable to reach the top bunk due to his disability. Dixon went to the officers' station to discuss this issue on August 12, 2013. Officer Nathan Pollock was present, among others.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Dixon tried to explain the problem to the officers, but they refused to listen to him. As Dixon continued to speak, Pollock began to shout at him. Dixon asked Pollock why he was shouting, and Pollock leapt out of his chair, approached Dixon threateningly, and told him to return to his assigned dormitory. Dixon turned to leave. After that, Pollock stepped on his right heel, tripping him. Pollock then picked Dixon up from the cement floor and slammed him down into it. Pollock proceeded to kick Dixon in his face and body for about two minutes before other officers approached and handcuffed Dixon. Dixon suffered serious injuries as a result. His shirt was soaked in blood and his face became unrecognizable from swelling. He fractured his ribs, bruised his sternum, lost eyesight and was unable to walk for a time, and suffered a concussion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Pollock's version of events differs significantly from Dixon's. Pollock claims that Dixon ignored several orders to leave the officers' station. After Dixon finally did turn to leave, he made a fist with his hand and turned back to lunge at Pollock. Pollock contends that he used appropriate force in a manner necessary to subdue Dixon and that no medical professional ever found evidence of any trauma or injury\n   suffered by Dixon as a result of this incident.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   On August 23, 2013, Dixon received a disciplinary report including one charge of Battery or Attempted Battery on a Correctional Officer. He was found guilty, and his punishment included a loss of gain time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On August 4, 2015, Dixon filed a lawsuit pursuant to 42 U.S.C \u00a7 1983 alleging,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , that Pollock used excessive force against him on August 12, 2013, in violation of his constitutional rights. Pollock moved to dismiss the complaint for a failure to exhaust administrative remedies and for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under\n   <em>\n    Heck\n   </em>\n   , and Pollock further moved for summary judgment. The Magistrate Judge issued a Report and Recommendation (\"R&amp;R\") recommending that Pollock's motion to dismiss be granted on the basis of\n   <em>\n    Heck\n   </em>\n   (but that it was due to be denied on exhaustion grounds) and recommending that Pollock's motion for summary judgment be denied as moot. The District Court adopted the R&amp;R and dismissed the complaint, and Dixon filed this appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \"[A]s long as it is possible that a \u00a7 1983 suit would not negate the underlying [punishment], then the suit is not\n   <em>\n    Heck\n   </em>\n   -barred.\"\n   <em>\n    Dyer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6046254\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/488/876/#p884\">\n    488 F.3d at 879-80\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Heck\n   </em>\n   bars a \u00a7 1983 suit only when it is a \"logical necessity\" that judgment for the plaintiff in that suit would contradict the existing punishment.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6046254\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/488/876/#p884\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6046254\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/488/876/#p884\">\n    at 879\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

On November 9, 2001, the plaintiff was lawfully present at the approximate location of Ridgefield Road and Country Club Drive at or about the railroad tracks in Ridgefield, in the Northern District of Illinois.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n    6. At the time and date aforesaid, the plaintiff did not pose a threat of violence or great bodily harm to the defendant, was not in the commission of a forcible felony nor was he attempting to resist, escape or defeat an arrest otherwise [\n    <em>\n     sic\n    </em>\n    ] acting so as to justify the use of deadly force by the defendant.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n    7.

Because McCann chose to plead that he did not pose a threat of violence, that he did not act in a manner that justified the use of deadly force, and that the deputy shot him without justification, the district court determined that he created a complaint impossibly inconsistent with his assault conviction, and\n    <em>\n     Heck\n    </em>\n    barred it.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3774296\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/466/619/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-41\">\n    The Seventh Circuit reversed. It determined that the district court did not give McCann \"the benefit of all reasonable inferences\" and did not appropriately view his complaint in the light most favorable to him.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3774296\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/466/619/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3774296\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/466/619/\">\n     at 622\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Had the court done so, it could have read the complaint as a claim that McCann \"never posed a threat of violence, attempted escape, or resisted arrest\n    <em>\n     to a degree\n    </em>\n    that would have justified the use of deadly force as a response.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3774296\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/466/619/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    This claim, when so construed, was not necessarily inconsistent with McCann's assault conviction.\n    <em>\n     Heck\n    </em>\n    did not bar the \u00a7 1983 suit.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-42\">\n    At this stage, a court may determine that Dixon does not dispute this fact in his complaint. Construing Dixon's complaint in the light most favorable to him, it is possible to read the Statement of Facts as silent on what transpired between the time he turned to walk away from the officers' station and the time that Pollock began to use force against him. Pollock contends that it was during this period that Dixon formed a fist with his hand and lunged at him.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
