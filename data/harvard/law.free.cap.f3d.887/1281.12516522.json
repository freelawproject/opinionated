After the Alabama Supreme Court set an execution date, Mr. Moody filed a counseled petition for a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202241\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . He named the warden of the Alabama facility where he is currently incarcerated as the respondent, and asserted in two related claims that under federal law Alabama cannot legally carry out his scheduled execution. He argued that before Alabama can put him to death, he must first be returned to the custody of the United States to serve federal sentences of life imprisonment which had been imposed on him at an earlier time. If Mr. Moody is correct, Alabama will never be able to execute him because he will die in federal prison.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The district court ruled that Mr. Moody lacked Article III standing and that he failed to obtain Eleventh Circuit authorization for his second claim, which amounted to an unauthorized second or successive habeas corpus petition under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202254\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202244\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2)-(3). It therefore dismissed his case without prejudice. When Mr. Moody appealed, we expedited briefing and invited the United States to present its views. We heard oral argument on April 12, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   We affirm the dismissal of Mr. Moody's \u00a7 2241 petition, but on different grounds. We conclude that Mr. Moody has standing, and that his second claim does not constitute an unauthorized second or successive \u00a7 2254 petition. We also hold, however, that Mr. Moody's claims fail on the merits, and we remand the case to the district court with instructions to enter a judgment dismissing those claims with prejudice.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    I\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In December of 1989, Mr. Moody mailed four package bombs to locations in Alabama, Georgia, and Florida. Two of those bombs detonated, killing United States Circuit Judge Robert Vance at his home in Alabama and civil rights attorney Robert Robinson at his office in Georgia.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   A federal jury convicted Mr. Moody of 71 charges related to the bombings, and the district court sentenced him in August of 1991 to seven consecutive terms of life imprisonment and a concurrent term of 400 years. The district court remanded Mr. Moody \"to the custody of the United States Marshal,\" D.E. 1, Exh. A at 3, and he was incarcerated at the United States Penitentiary in Marion, Illinois. His federal convictions and sentences were affirmed on direct appeal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

To secure custody of Mr. Moody for prosecution in Alabama, a state circuit court issued a writ of habeas corpus ad prosequendum on February 17, 1992. That writ ordered the United States Marshal and the Sheriff of Jefferson County to \"produce the body of\" Mr. Moody before the court for a hearing, and for a trial then scheduled for May 4, 1992.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D.E. 1, Exh. B. The writ also contemplated that Alabama authorities would return Mr. Moody to federal custody once the state proceedings were over. It stated that \"at the conclusion of said hearing the body of ... [Mr.] Moody ... be returned to the custody of the United States Marshal in\n   the U.S. Penitentiary, Marion, Illinois, all in accordance with the regulations and directions of the United States Marshal.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . Several days later, the writ was executed and Mr. Moody was brought from Marion to Jefferson County.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   An Alabama jury found Mr. Moody guilty of capital murder and assault, and in February of 1997 the trial court sentenced him to death for Judge Vance's murder. In December of 1998 the United States Marshal for the Southern District of Alabama filed a detainer with the Alabama Department of Corrections. The detainer acknowledged that Mr. Moody was in Alabama custody and requested as follows: \"Prior to [Mr. Moody's] release from your custody, please notify this office at once so that we may assume custody of [him] for service of his Federal sentence of imprisonment.\" D.E. 1, Exh. G. The detainer also stated that \"[t]he notice and speedy trial requirements of the Interstate Agreement on Detainers Act do NOT apply to this [d]etainer.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . The Alabama Department of Corrections acknowledged receipt of the federal detainer on December 22, 1998. The detainer did not request that Mr. Moody be transferred to federal custody once his state court proceedings were completed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Mr. Moody appealed his state convictions and sentences, but the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Moody v.

He has never been returned to the United States Penitentiary in Marion, Illinois. In this court, the United States has stated-in writing and at oral argument-that it has no objection to Alabama maintaining custody of Mr. Moody for the purpose of carrying out the death sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    II\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Mr. Moody argues on appeal that he is entitled to habeas relief under \u00a7 2241 because Alabama's wrongful retention of him violates the writ of habeas corpus ad prosequendum (through which he was transferred to Alabama for prosecution), federal law, and his constitutional right to due process.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Petition at 6-11.

He claims that Alabama is wrongfully exercising custody of him and that it refuses to return him to the custody of the United States to serve his federal sentences of life imprisonment. And he contends that, if Alabama is not required to relinquish custody, he will imminently suffer an injury-his scheduled execution. We think it is beyond dispute that the potential loss of life is a cognizable injury for purposes of Article III. As Judge Learned Hand put it in an almost identical case many decades ago: \"Obviously [a petitioner facing execution by the state] has actually the greatest possible interest in serving the remainder of his federal sentence.\"\n   <em>\n    United States ex rel.

He asserts that Alabama's refusal to\n   return him to the custody of the United States in accordance with federal law is what will cause his execution. This easily establishes that Mr. Moody's injury (the imminent loss of life due to execution) is \"fairly traceable to the challenged action\" of Alabama (the failure to return him to the federal government).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lujan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730070\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/555/#p560\">\n    504 U.S. at 560\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730070\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/555/#p560\">\n    112 S.Ct. 2130\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (alterations adopted). \"Proximate cause,\" after all, \"is not a requirement of Article III standing[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Lexmark Int'l, Inc. v.

If Mr. Moody is correct and succeeds in obtaining an order (such as an injunction) requiring Alabama to return him to the custody of the United States, his injury would be redressed because-given his federal sentences of life imprisonment-he would not (absent a pardon or early release) be executed.

The second claim in Mr. Moody's \u00a7 2241 petition does not seek to vacate or set aside any of the Alabama convictions and sentences. Instead, the claim requests that those sentences (including the death sentence for the murder of Judge Vance) be carried out only after Mr. Moody serves the sentences first meted out by the United States.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   We recognize, of course, that if Mr. Moody is ultimately successful in his \u00a7 2241 petition, and if he fully serves his federal sentences, he will effectively prevent Alabama from ever executing him. But that is not because the Alabama sentence of death is claimed to be legally invalid under federal law. It is because of the order in which the two sovereigns must (in Mr. Moody's view) carry out their respective sentences, and because of the length of the federal sentences. If Mr. Moody, for example, had been sentenced to a total of 20 years in prison for his federal offenses, his transfer to federal custody after the Alabama proceedings were complete would not have prevented Alabama from carrying out the death penalty because Alabama would have obtained custody of Mr. Moody again once his federal sentences were fully served.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    C\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   This brings us to the merits.

So in one sense it may be said that Alabama wrongfully retained custody of Mr. Moody once the Alabama criminal proceedings were complete.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   But the detainer which the United States lodged with Alabama in 1998 acknowledged that Mr. Moody was in state custody and requested only that Alabama provide the United States with notice \"prior to [Mr. Moody's] release from [Alabama] custody\" so that it could then \"assume custody of [him] for service of his Federal sentence of imprisonment.\" D.E. 1, Exh. G. The language of the detainer suggests that in the late 1990s the United\n   States had decided to have Alabama keep custody of Mr. Moody for an indefinite period of time.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Causey v.

It is not. ... If it was unlawful for the Attorney General to surrender custody of the prisoner, and to make it impossible for any further execution of the federal sentence, it was not a wrong for him, for that sentence was imposed only in the interest of the United States, not in any degree whatever as a benefit to the relator. He has been deprived of nothing to which he was entitled; if the United States has been so deprived, he may not vicariously assert its rights.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3698113\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/141/259/#p259\">\n    141 F.2d at 259-60\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   If these cases were the only ones on the books, we would have to decide whether to follow them as persuasive.

He was then extradited to Florida, where he was convicted and sentenced to death for another murder occurring there.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"571787\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/85/513/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"571787\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/85/513/\">\n    at 515\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . After pursuing post-conviction relief in Florida, he filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in federal court, asserting among other things that under Florida's version of the Interstate Agreement on Detainers Act he could not be executed and had to be returned to Kansas.
