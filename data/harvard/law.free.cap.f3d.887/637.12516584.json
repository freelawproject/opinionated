This case requires us to determine whether citizens may bring suit alleging a violation of the CWA when the source of the pollution, the pipeline, is no longer releasing the pollutant, but the pollutant allegedly is passing a short distance through the earth via ground water and is being discharged into surface waterways.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The district court held that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction under the CWA, because the pipeline has been repaired and the pollutants currently pass through ground water to reach navigable waters.

In December 2014, citizens in Anderson County, South Carolina, discovered dead plants, a petroleum odor, and pools of gasoline in the vicinity of the pipeline. The plaintiffs allege that gasoline and gasoline toxins have seeped and continue to seep into ground water, wetlands, and waterways in Anderson County and the Savannah River watershed. They allege that although a reported 209,000 gallons were recovered by the end of 2015, no significant amount of contaminants has been removed since that time. Consequently, at the time that the plaintiffs filed their complaint, at least 160,000 gallons allegedly remained unrecovered. Kinder Morgan repaired the pipeline shortly after the initial spill.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   When Kinder Morgan's pipeline broke six to eight feet underground, gasoline and related contaminants spilled out into soil and ground water. The plaintiffs allege that these contaminants are seeping into two nearby tributaries of the Savannah River, Browns Creek and Cupboard Creek, and their adjacent wetlands. The pipeline broke less than 1000 feet from Browns Creek and its adjacent wetland, and 400 feet from Cupboard Creek and a second wetland. Both waterways and the wetlands are downgradient from the spill site. The plaintiffs allege that gasoline pollutants from the pipeline are seeping into navigable waters as defined by the CWA, including the above two creeks in Anderson County, Broadway Lake, Lake\n   Secession, Lake Russell, and the Savannah River.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The plaintiffs allege that a \"plume\" of petroleum contaminants continues to migrate into these waterways years later through ground water and various natural formations at the spill site, including \"seeps, flows, fissures, and channels.\" Hazardous gasoline contaminants have been detected on several occasions at the spill site in ground water wells. Contaminants were also detected in Browns Creek as early as January 2015, and additional tests in Browns Creek have reported high levels of contaminants on several later dates in 2015 and in 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Kinder Morgan has implemented certain remediation and recovery measures under the guidance of the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control (DHEC). DHEC is the agency authorized to issue NPDES permits and oversee water quality in South Carolina.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Friends of the Earth, Inc. v. Gaston Copper Recycling Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4078537\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/629/387/#p390\">\n    629 F.3d 387\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 390 (4th Cir. 2011) [\n   <em>\n    Friends of the Earth III\n   </em>\n   ]; S.C. Code \u00a7 48-1-100(B).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The plaintiffs allege that Kinder Morgan has failed to comply fully with DHEC's abatement instructions. They claim that although DHEC instructed Kinder Morgan to test for pollution in March 2016, Kinder Morgan only began that additional testing after the plaintiffs made their own visit to the spill site in August 2016. The plaintiffs further allege that their testing conducted in August 2016 revealed that the levels of gasoline contaminants in Browns Creek actually were increasing almost two years after the spill. During their August 2016 visit to the area, oil sheens were visible on the surface of Browns Creek, and devices used to absorb the oil had not been maintained and were saturated with oil.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Kinder Morgan allegedly delayed by six months its submission to DHEC of the required site remediation plan and site assessment, and also refused to comply with another of DHEC's water sampling requests. Publicly available data on DHEC's website indicate that DHEC sampled surface waters at Browns Creek in February 2017 and found pollutants at three locations, each of which is being remediated.

The plaintiffs thus allege in their complaint two interrelated violations of the CWA: (1) that Kinder Morgan has caused discharges of pollutants from point sources to navigable waters without a permit; and (2) that Kinder Morgan has caused discharges of pollutants\n   that continue to pass through ground water with a \"direct hydrological connection\" to navigable waters. The plaintiffs also allege that the remediation actions taken to date by Kinder Morgan have been insufficient to abate the pollution, and seek damages, declaratory relief, and injunctive relief requiring that Kinder Morgan take further measures to control and abate the spill.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Kinder Morgan moved to dismiss the plaintiffs' complaint under Rules 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, contending both that the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction and that the plaintiffs had failed to state a claim for relief. Addressing first the sufficiency of the plaintiffs' pleadings, the district court held that the plaintiffs had failed to state a claim because the pipeline had been repaired and no longer was discharging pollutants \"directly\" into navigable waters. The court also held that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the complaint, stating that the CWA did not encompass the movement of pollutants through ground water that is hydrologically connected to navigable waters. Accordingly, the court dismissed the plaintiffs' complaint on both grounds. The plaintiffs timely noted this appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   On appeal, the plaintiffs contend that the district court erred in determining that the continuing addition of pollutants to navigable waters is not an ongoing violation of the CWA because the pipeline has been repaired. According to the plaintiffs, a claim for a discharge of a pollutant, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201311\">\n    33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1311\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), need not allege that the pollutant is being discharged\n   <em>\n    directly\n   </em>\n   from the point source into navigable waters. They assert that the CWA also prohibits the discharge of pollutants from a point source through ground water that has a direct hydrological connection to navigable waters.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In response, Kinder Morgan contends that the district court did not err because the violation ceased once the pipeline was repaired. Alternatively, Kinder Morgan asserts that if seepage is ongoing, the pollution is seeping from nonpoint sources, namely, from natural formations at the spill site. Kinder Morgan also argues that discharges into navigable waters from hydrologically connected ground water do not fall within the CWA's definition of a \"discharge of a pollutant\" in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201362\">\n    33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (12)(A).

Maj. Op. at 649. While this conclusion may seem intuitive at first glance, close examination of the text, history, and structure of the CWA reveals that not every addition of pollution amounts to a CWA violation-much less an ongoing CWA violation. Congress precisely defined a CWA violation as the addition of pollutants\n   <em>\n    from a point source\n   </em>\n   , and for there to be an ongoing CWA violation, there must be an ongoing addition of pollutants from a point source into navigable waters.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"162\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201362\">\n    33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (12). Here, the only point source at issue-Kinder Morgan's pipeline-has been repaired and is not currently adding any pollutants into navigable waters, thus negating a necessary element of a CWA violation. Because there is no ongoing violation under the meaning of the CWA, I would affirm the district court's dismissal of the complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.

In late 2014, residents of Belton, South Carolina, discovered that Kinder Morgan's pipeline released a large amount of gasoline and contaminated the nearby ground (\"spill site\"). Kinder Morgan repaired the pipeline within a few days of discovering the leak and began remediation efforts that are ongoing to this day under the supervision of the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control (DHEC). Kinder Morgan has recovered over 209,000 gallons of gasoline, but over 160,000 gallons of gasoline remain unrecovered at the spill site. Kinder Morgan's repaired pipeline is not currently leaking any additional gasoline. Nevertheless, as the gasoline from the spill site gets washed off by ground water or seeps through the ground from the spill site, gasoline is being introduced to navigable waters. In December 2016, the environmental groups Upstate Forever and Savannah Riverkeeper (collectively, \"Appellants\") initiated a citizen suit against Kinder Morgan, alleging an ongoing CWA violation. After full briefing on the matter, on April 20, 2017, the district court dismissed the Appellants' complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and failure to state a claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   We review a district court's order dismissing a complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and for failure to state a claim\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   <em>\n    Goldfarb v.

The majority notes that \"[t]he CWA's language does not require that the point source continue to release a pollutant for a violation to be ongoing.\" Maj. Op. at 648. It is difficult to see how there could be an ongoing CWA violation-defined as \"any addition of pollutants ... from any point source\"-without an ongoing discharging activity from a point source.

The majority also seemingly recognizes that pollutants must be actively \"\n   <em>\n    originating\n   </em>\n   from a point source.\" Maj. Op. at 648 (emphasis added). However, the majority's theory is that since the pollutants in the spill site\n   <em>\n    once came\n   </em>\n   from the pipeline, the continuing addition from the spill site is thus a continuing discharge from a point source. But accepting this position would effectively erase the phrase\n   <em>\n    from any point source\n   </em>\n   out of the CWA,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"292\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201362\">\n    33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (12), and find an ongoing CWA violation even though no pollutant is originating or being added from a point source any longer.

Kinder Morgan is a past violator-that is, it indirectly added pollutants to navigable waters from its point source when its pipeline leaked and released a large amount of gasoline that reached navigable waters. Although Kinder Morgan's pipeline itself is not currently leaking, the effects of Kinder Morgan's past violation continue. The spill site continues to introduce gasoline into navigable waters as gasoline migrates through the ground or as ground water washes off and carries gasoline to navigable waters. This Court has not addressed whether a past discharge with lasting effects-through an ongoing migration of pollutants through groundwater movement-can support a citizen suit.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ohio Valley Envtl.

First, ongoing migration does not involve a point source, thus negating an essential element of a CWA violation.

And Congress precisely defined a CWA violation as a point source discharge without an NPDES permit. The critical element-the addition from a point source-cannot be satisfied here because Kinder Morgan has repaired its pipeline and the pipeline is not currently leaking or adding pollutants to navigable waters. The Appellants can only point to nonpoint pollution from the spill site or the past violation, which cannot give rise to a citizen suit under the CWA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   Barring the Appellants' citizen suit would not necessarily mean that Kinder Morgan will evade accountability. Under the CWA, the primary responsibility for enforcement rests with the state and federal governments.\n   <em>\n    The Piney Run\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6050272\" index=\"333\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/523/453/#p456\">\n    523 F.3d at 456\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In fact, the State of South Carolina, through DHEC, has stepped in and is actively overseeing the remediation efforts. DHEC has directed Kinder Morgan to investigate the impact of the spill and implement corrective action plans. After a series of back and forth revisions between DHEC and Kinder Morgan, on March 1, 2017, DHEC approved the \"Startup Plan for Surface Water Protection Measures\" that was meant to implement additional remedial measures in the spill site. App. 351. Thus, even without a CWA citizen suit, the State of South Carolina is protecting and remediating the\n   waters and natural resources within its borders. In addition to ordering Kinder Morgan to remediate the spill site, the state and federal governments are also empowered to use criminal, civil, and administrative enforcement actions for even for\n   <em>\n    past\n   </em>\n   violations of the CWA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   Moreover, if a CWA citizen suit fails for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, other state and federal laws may provide actionable claims against Kinder Morgan. South Carolina state law may provide a more encompassing response. As the\n   <em>\n    amici\n   </em>\n   States have pointed out, Brief of the\n   <em>\n    Amici\n   </em>\n   States 22-23, South Carolina law provides for the state to recover monetarily from polluters for violations that includes even nonpoint source pollution,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   S.C. Code \u00a7 48-1-90(a)(1). In addition to the enforcement mechanism under state law, other federal laws could provide recourse. In response to Kinder Morgan's past spill, a federal citizen suit may perhaps be more appropriate under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"334\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%209601\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9601\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , which is \"designed to effectuate the cleanup of toxic waste sites\" and to impose cleanup costs,\n   <em>\n    Meghrig v.
