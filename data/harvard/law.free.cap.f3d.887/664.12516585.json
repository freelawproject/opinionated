AAM's member-manufacturers, only one of which is based in Maryland, typically sell their products to wholesale pharmaceutical distributors,\n   <em>\n    none of which are based in Maryland\n   </em>\n   . The vast majority of these sales occur outside Maryland's borders.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On July 6, 2017, AAM filed this action against Brian Frosh, Maryland's Attorney General, and Dennis R. Schrader, Secretary of the Maryland Department of Health (collectively, \"Maryland\"). Among other claims, AAM asserts that the Act violates the dormant commerce clause and is unconstitutionally vague. Maryland filed a motion to dismiss AAM's suit, which the district court granted as to the dormant commerce clause claim but denied as to the vagueness claim. The district court also denied AAM's motion for a preliminary injunction.

First, the Act is not triggered by any conduct that takes place within Maryland. Second, even if it were, the Act controls the prices of transactions that occur outside the state.

Md. Code Ann. Health-Gen. \u00a7\u00a7 2-801 to - 803 (2017). But a trade association representing generic pharmaceutical manufacturers-which styles itself the \"Association for Accessible Medicines\" (\"AAM\" or \"Plaintiff\")-brought this action to enjoin the Maryland statute on grounds that it violates the dormant Commerce Clause and is unconstitutionally vague. The district court upheld Maryland's authority under the dormant Commerce Clause to protect its citizens from the abusive pricing practices at issue. I agree with the district court's holding, but my colleagues in the majority hold otherwise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   In particular, the majority opinion holds that the Maryland statute violates the dormant Commerce Clause's \"extraterritoriality doctrine\" to the extent that it applies to sales of generic drugs between manufacturers and distributors consummated outside of Maryland, even when the generic drugs involved in such out-of-state transactions are subsequently resold to Maryland consumers.\n   <em>\n    Ante\n   </em>\n   at 671-72. Put differently, the majority opinion concludes that the Commerce Clause bars Maryland from protecting its citizens against unconscionable pricing practices by out-of-state generic drug manufacturers who distribute their drugs to Maryland's citizens through an out-of-state intermediary. That conclusion conflicts with the approach taken by several of our sister circuits in deciding whether a state statute's extraterritorial reach violates the dormant Commerce Clause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Contrary to the majority opinion's conclusion, Maryland is authorized under its \"general police powers to regulate matters of legitimate local concern.\"\n   <em>\n    Lewis v.

Here, Maryland legitimately targeted generic drug pricing practices specifically designed to prey on the special vulnerabilities of a defenseless group of Maryland's citizens. Simply put, the Maryland statute-which applies equally to in-state and out-of-state manufacturers and distributors-does not implicate the concerns that lie at the heart of the Supreme Court's dormant Commerce Clause jurisprudence: economic protectionism, discrimination against interstate commerce, and State regulation of streams of transactions that never cross through the State's borders.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dep't of Revenue of Ky. v.

Both reports were prompted by media stories highlighting significant increases in the price of certain generic drugs.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Jonathan D. Alpern\n   <em>\n    et al.\n   </em>\n   , High-Cost Generic Drugs-Implications for Patients and Policy Makers, 371 N. Engl. J.

The GAO Report found that for a basket of 1,441 \"established generic drugs\"-\"drugs that were continuously billed under Medicare Part D ... during [the] study period\"-prices fell, on average, 0.7 percent per quarter from the first quarter of 2010 through the second quarter of 2015.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 9. Although prices for established generic drugs generally declined during the 2010 to 2015 period, the GAO Report further found that \"315 of the 1,441 established drugs experienced an extraordinary price increase-a price increase of at least 100 percent.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12. Notably, the number of established drugs experiencing a price increase of at least 100 percent\n   <em>\n    increased\n   </em>\n   during the five-year study period:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   45 drugs experienced such an increase between the first quarter of 2010 and the first quarter of 2011, whereas 103 drugs experienced such an increase between the first quarter of 2014 and the first quarter of 2015.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12, 18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   A smaller subset of established generic drugs experienced even more \"extraordinary\" price increases-48 such drugs experienced a price increase of 500 percent or greater and 15 such drugs experienced a price increase of 1,000 percent or greater.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14. The vast majority of these extraordinary price increases persisted throughout the term of the study.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Most of the established generic drugs experiencing extraordinary price increases were not among the 100 most heavily prescribed established generic drugs covered under Medicare Part D. To that end, stakeholders interviewed by GAO reported that \"[i]f a generic drug serves a small [patient] population, ... it [is] more susceptible to price increases\" because \"there may be little financial incentive for a [competing] manufacturer to enter the market\" and thus less \"downward pressure on price.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 24. Stakeholders also reported that supplier and buyer consolidation can drive price increases, as can difficulty manufacturing a particular generic drug.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   The second report, prepared by the United States Senate Special Committee on Aging, investigated and analyzed several \"abrupt and dramatic\" price increases for certain generic drugs.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Senate Special Comm. on Aging,\n   <em>\n    Sudden Price Spikes in Off-Patent Prescription Drugs: The Monopoly Business Model that Harms Patients, Taxpayers, and the U.S. Health Care System\n   </em>\n   3 (2016) [hereinafter, \"Senate Report\"]. The Senate Report examined the circumstances surrounding large price increases for seven generic drugs, all of which had lacked patent protection for decades, sold by four generic pharmaceutical companies-two of which were formed and managed by since-convicted investor Martin Shkreli.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5-6. All seven price increases exceeded 300 percent, with five of the price increases at or exceeding 2,000 percent.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   The Senate investigation revealed that the four companies followed a common \"business model\" in acquiring and marketing the seven generic drugs.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4. In particular, each case involved a (1) single-source generic drug (2) distributed through a \"closed distribution system\" that (3) was essential to-the \"gold standard\" for-(4) treating a rare condition.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4, 30-31. Each of these four characteristics allowed the company to \"exercise de facto monopoly pricing power, and then impose and protect astronomical price increases,\" the Senate committee found.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   For example, single-source drugs distributed through closed-distribution systems-which make it harder for potential entrants to bring to market a competitive product or attract and retain patients-are unlikely to face competition, thereby allowing sellers to charge monopoly prices, notwithstanding the generic drug's lack of patent protection.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4, 30-31. Likewise, when a generic drug is the \"gold standard\" for treating a particular condition, physicians continue to prescribe the drug, even in the face of substantial price increases.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 30;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 56 (chief executive of one generic firm explaining that it had monopoly \"pricing\n   power\" for a generic drug that is the standard-of-care for treating a rare and deadly disease because, absent the drug, patients would face \"liver failure or a liver transplant or even death\"). And because the generic drugs treat a \"rare\" condition \"the patient population dependent upon them [is] too small to organize effective opposition to the price increase.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 31.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   The Senate Report found that the large price increases \"devastated patients ... across the nation,\" many of whom were \"forced to go without vital medicine[s]\" or switch to alternative, potentially less effective, therapies.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7-8. The price increases also harmed providers. For example, the Johns Hopkins Health System, which is headquartered in Maryland, reported that it lost nearly $1 million in 2015 alone as a result of several-hundred-fold price increases for two of the drugs.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6-8. The price increases also led to increases in spending by governmental health care programs, including state Medicaid programs.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 110. The report further concluded that existing federal competition laws were inadequate to prevent the dramatic price increases and suggested several statutory and regulatory remedies.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 116-25.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   After reviewing these reports, the Maryland legislature decided to enact legislation to combat what it concluded were abusive pricing practices by certain generic drug suppliers. To that end, on May 27, 2017, the Maryland General Assembly passed HB 631. That statute, which went into effect on October 1, 2017, prohibits manufacturers and distributors from engaging in \"price gouging\" in the sale of an \"essential off-patent or generic drug.\" Md. Code Ann. Health-Gen. \u00a7 2-802(a). The statute exempts \"wholesale distributors\" from liability, however, if they impose a price increase that \"is directly attributable to additional costs for the drug imposed on the wholesale distributor by the manufacturer of the drug.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 2-802(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   HB 631 defines \"essential off-patent or generic drug\" as a drug: (1) \"[f]or which all exclusive marketing rights, if any, granted under the federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, \u00a7 351 of the federal Public Health Service Act, and federal patent law have expired\"; (2) that is listed on the Model List of Essential Medicines, as adopted by the World Health Organization, or that has been has been designated, according to specified criteria, an \"essential medicine\" by the Maryland Secretary of Health; (3) \"[t]hat is actively manufactured and marketed for sale in the United States by three or fewer manufacturers\"; and (4) that is \"made available for sale\" in the State of Maryland.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 2-801(b)(1). \"Essential off-patent or generic drug\" also includes any \"drug-device combination product used for the delivery of a drug\" for which all exclusive marketing rights have expired.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 2-801(b)(2). Although HB 631 regulates only those generic drugs \"made available for sale\" in Maryland, \"a person who is alleged to have violated [the statute] may not assert as a defense that the person did not deal directly with a consumer residing in the State.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7\u00a7 2-801(b)(1), 2-803(g).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   The statute defines \"price gouging\" as an \"unconscionable increase in the price of a prescription drug.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 2-801(c). Tracking many aspects of the \"business model\" identified in the Senate Report, the statute provides that an \"unconscionable increase\" means an increase in price that (1) \"[i]s excessive and not justified by the cost of producing the drug or the cost of appropriate expansion of access to the drug to promote public health\"; and (2) \"[r]esults in consumers for whom the drug has been prescribed having no meaningful choice about whether to purchase the drug at an excessive price\" due to the \"importance of\n   the drug to their health\" and insufficient market competition.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 2-801(f).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   HB 631 authorizes the Attorney General to petition a Maryland circuit court to restrain or enjoin violations of the statute; restore money to consumers obtained as a result of violations; require manufacturers that have engaged in \"price gouging\" to provide the drug to participants in any state health plan or state health program at the drug's last permissible price for a period of up to one year; and order civil penalties of up to $10,000.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 2-803(d).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   HB 631 also confers monitoring authority on the State's Medicaid program, the Maryland Medical Assistance Program (the \"Medicaid Program\"). In particular, the Medicaid Program may notify the Attorney General of certain price increases to an \"essential off-patent or generic drug.\" Specifically, the Medicaid Program may notify the Attorney General if (1) a price increase, either by itself or together with other price increases, would cause a fifty percent or more increase, as measured within a one year time period, to the wholesale acquisition cost or price paid by the Medicaid Program; and (2) it would cost $80 at the wholesale acquisition cost to obtain a thirty day supply of the maximum recommended dosage, a full course of treatment, or if the drug is not made available in such quantities, it would exceed $80 at the wholesale acquisition cost to obtain a thirty day supply or full course of treatment.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 2-803(a). After receiving notification of such an increase, the Attorney General may demand that the manufacturer imposing the increase submit documentation that itemizes the cost of production; provides explanation for the price increase, including information related to any expenditures made to \"expand access to the drug,\" as well as the associated benefits to the public health; and any other relevant information.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 2-803(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   On appeal, AAM argues that HB 631, as applied to any transaction consummated outside of Maryland's borders, violates the Commerce Clause, regardless of whether the drugs involved in such transaction later are resold in Maryland. Before addressing the merits of that claim, it is first necessary to determine what the Maryland legislature intended when it limited HB 631's extraterritorial reach to generic drugs \"made available for sale\" in Maryland.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 2-801(b)(1). The district court held, correctly in my view, that HB 631 is \"triggered only when there is a drug ... made available for sale\n   <em>\n    within\n   </em>\n   [Maryland].\"\n   <em>\n    Ass'n for Accessible Meds. v.

Before the district court and this Court, the State repeatedly asserted that HB 631 \"\n   <em>\n    in no way prohibits\n   </em>\n   any of AAM's members from selling drugs at a conscience-shocking price to distributors, to the extent that those drugs are later sold in California or in any other state.\" J.A. 291 (emphasis added);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Appellee's Br. 7 (representing\n   that HB 631 \"applies only when drugs are sold in Maryland\").

Rather, it forbids manufacturers from imposing an \"unconscionable\" price increase for essential generic drugs. \u00a7 2-801(c). Generic drug manufacturers, therefore, retain broad discretion to set prices for essential generic drugs and to increase the prices of such drugs, even if another state adopted a similar law. Accordingly, the majority opinion's contention that a manufacturer could not comply with two such laws in a single transaction is speculative, at best, and therefore does not offer a basis for striking down a state statute on extraterritoriality grounds, particularly when AAM identifies no State which has adopted, or intends to adopt, a potentially conflicting regulation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rocky Mountain\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3703672\" index=\"311\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/730/1070/#p1103\">\n    730 F.3d at 1104-05\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"To show the threat of inconsistent regulation, Plaintiffs must either present evidence that conflicting, legitimate legislation is already in place or that the threat of such legislation is both actual and imminent.\" (internal quotation marks omitted));\n   <em>\n    Sorrell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1952955\" index=\"312\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/272/104/#p110\">\n    272 F.3d at 112\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"It is not enough to point to a risk of conflicting regulatory\n   regimes in multiple states; there must be an actual conflict between the challenged regulation and those in place in other states.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   As a matter of law, the majority opinion does not cite any authority-nor have I found any-holding that the dormant Commerce Clause entitles manufacturers to consummate all sales to a distributor in \"a single transaction.\" On the contrary, as the majority opinion acknowledges,\n   <em>\n    ante\n   </em>\n   at 673, courts have recognized that a State can adopt a consumer protection law that may require a manufacturer to sell different products or versions of products for resale in the State than it sells in other States.

On the contrary, HB 631 does not purport to regulate the price of essential generic drugs that do not enter Maryland's borders, nor does it bar other States from regulating differently the price of essential generic drugs sold to consumers within their borders. And AAM has not argued-much less proven-that its members could not restructure their distribution processes and contracts to ensure that distributors do not resell unconscionably priced generic drugs into Maryland. Again to the contrary, there would seem to be no obstacle to a generic drug manufacturer entering into a single contract with a distributor for an essential generic drug, under which the manufacturer imposes a conscience-shocking price increase for those pills the distributor resells outside of Maryland and a non-conscience-shocking price increase for the pills the distributor resells in Maryland.

I do not believe that either the Framers or the Supreme Court intended for the Commerce Clause to serve such a purpose.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   At the end of the day, AAM argues-and the majority opinion concludes-that, absent federal regulation, its members are\n   <em>\n    constitutionally entitled\n   </em>\n   to impose conscience-shocking price increases on Maryland consumers, so long as AAM's members sell their essential generic drugs to Maryland consumers through out-of-state intermediaries.
