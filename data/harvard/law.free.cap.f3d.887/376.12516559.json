In 1991, the Missouri Department of Health and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) detected TCE contamination in residential wells in the Villages of Silver Creek and Saginaw, communities south of the FAG Bearings plant. Subsequent litigation established that FAG Bearings was solely responsible for the TCE contamination in Silver Creek and Saginaw. FAG Bearings began cooperating with EPA and Missouri Department of Health remediation, efforts that continued after Schaeffler Group USA acquired the facility in 2005.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Janice and Stan Kirk moved to Silver Creek in 1987. Their daughter, plaintiff Jodelle Kirk (Kirk), was born the following year and spent her entire childhood in Silver Creek. In 2002, Kirk was diagnosed with autoimmune hepatitis (AIH), a liver disease that occurs when a person's immune system produces antibodies that attack\n   liver proteins, creating inflammation that can lead to fibrosis and cirrhosis. Kirk remains on medication to manage her AIH and faces serious medical issues in the years ahead. In 2013, Kirk brought this diversity action against FAG Bearings, LLC\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and Schaeffler Group USA (collectively, \"Schaeffler\"), seeking compensatory and punitive damages. Kirk alleged that Schaeffler's negligent release of TCE and failure to warn the community of TCE contamination caused her to develop AIH.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   After discovery, the district court denied Schaeffler's motion for summary judgment. As relevant here, the court concluded that Kirk presented sufficient evidence of causation for a jury to find defendants liable, and that Schaeffler Group USA is judicially estopped to deny it can be held responsible as successor for FAG Bearings' tortious conduct. After a lengthy trial, the district court instructed the jury to return a verdict for Kirk if it found that defendants' negligent \"handling, use, or disposal of [TCE] at the Joplin plant, or [failure] to properly warn Plaintiff of the TCE contamination,\" had directly caused or contributed to Kirk's injury. The jury awarded Kirk $7,600,000 in compensatory damages and, after submission of additional testimony and evidence addressing whether \"Defendants' conduct showed complete indifference to or conscious disregard for the safety of others,\" $13,000,000 in punitive damages. The district court denied Schaeffler's motions for judgment as a matter of law and a new trial. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On appeal, Schaeffler argues (i) the district court erred in concluding that judicial estoppel bars Schaeffler Group USA from denying that it is liable for FAG Bearings' pre-acquisition torts; (ii) the court abused its discretion by admitting Kirk's experts' opinions regarding whether TCE exposure caused Kirk's AIH, and evidence of regulatory standards governing safe levels of TCE in drinking water; and (iii) the court erred in denying judgment as a matter of law on the causation issue and on Kirk's failure to warn claim. We reverse the district court's judicial estoppel ruling and conclude that (i) Schaeffler Group USA was entitled to summary judgment on the successor liability issue, and therefore (ii) the jury's general verdict requires a new trial on Kirk's punitive damages claim against FAG Bearings, LLC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    I. The Judicial Estoppel Issue.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n   </strong>\n   Kirk's complaint alleged that Schaeffler Group USA \"owns the brand FAG and ... took on, purchased or otherwise assumed all assets, properties and liabilities of FAG Bearings LLC, and/or FAG Bearings Corporation.\" Schaeffler's motion for summary judgment alleged that, after the 2005 conversion, FAG Bearings became Schaeffler Group USA's wholly owned subsidiary; that under Missouri law a parent corporation is not responsible for its subsidiary's actions unless it is the subsidiary's alter ego or plaintiff pierces the corporate veil; that Kirk has the burden to prove Schaeffler Group USA is responsible for FAG Bearings' actions; and that Kirk had no evidence to show that the corporate veil should be pierced or that the Schaeffler parent had any role in FAG Bearings' alleged pre-acquisition tortious acts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In response, Kirk argued that Schaeffler Group USA should be judicially estopped to deny successor liability because \"it has taken the position in other litigation that its ... purchase of FAG Bearings amounted to a merger of the two companies and that it is responsible for the ... actions of FAG Bearings.\" Kirk cited a complaint Schaeffler Group USA filed against the United States before the United States Court of International Trade (CIT) in November 2006, and a February 2008 memorandum it filed in the District of Connecticut in unrelated litigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The district court denied Schaeffler Group USA's motion for summary judgment, invoking judicial estoppel based on the allegation in its complaint to the CIT that FAG Bearings Corporation \"by change of name and/or merger\" was \"absorbed into Schaeffler.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   In applying judicial estoppel, the district court considered the three non-exhaustive factors identified by the U.S. Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    New Hampshire v.

Second, courts regularly inquire whether the party has succeeded in persuading a court to accept that party's earlier position, so that judicial acceptance of an inconsistent position in a later proceeding would create the perception that either the first or the second court was misled. Absent success in a prior proceeding, a party's later inconsistent position introduces no risk of inconsistent court determinations.... A third consideration is whether the party seeking to assert an inconsistent position would derive an unfair advantage or impose an unfair detriment on the opposing party.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The district court ruled that Schaeffler Group USA's position before the CIT was \"clearly inconsistent\" with its position in this case because \"it is black letter law that a parent corporation lacks standing to sue for injuries suffered by a subsidiary.\" The court noted that the CIT stated in an opinion rejecting Schaeffler Group USA's claim on the merits that the court \"accepts [Schaeffler Group USA's] undisputed representation that it is the legal successor to ... FAG Bearings Corp.\"\n   <em>\n    Schaeffler Grp. USA, Inc. v.

Int'l Trade 2012). The district court ruled that judicial estoppel is appropriate because \"Schaeffler would derive an unfair advantage if not estopped, because it would avoid any liability that it would otherwise have to [Kirk].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The parties on appeal, like the district court, argue the judicial estoppel issue based on the above-quoted standards from\n   <em>\n    New Hampshire\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Stallings\n   </em>\n   , cases that were governed by federal law. However, in this diversity case, we apply the Missouri law of judicial estoppel.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Monterey Dev. Corp. v. Lawyer's Title Ins.

Judge Shepherd in dissent argues that the Supreme Court of Missouri has rejected the\n   <em>\n    New Hampshire\n   </em>\n   factors in favor of a \"more general\" standard: \"[j]udicial estoppel will lie to prevent litigants from taking a position, under oath, in one judicial proceeding, thereby obtaining benefits from that position in that instance and later, in a second proceeding, taking a contrary position in order to obtain benefits ... at that time.\"\n   <em>\n    State Bd. of Accountancy v.

The passage in\n   <em>\n    Zedner\n   </em>\n   quoted in\n   <em>\n    Taylor\n   </em>\n   was itself a quotation from\n   <em>\n    New Hampshire\n   </em>\n   , and after that passage, the U.S. Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Zedner\n   </em>\n   quoted the three\n   <em>\n    New Hampshire\n   </em>\n   factors. Though the Supreme Court of Missouri did not cite Taylor in its\n   <em>\n    State Board\n   </em>\n   opinion, it denied rehearing in\n   <em>\n    Taylor\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    the same day\n   </em>\n   it issued its opinion in\n   <em>\n    State Board\n   </em>\n   .

In Taylor and\n   <em>\n    State Board\n   </em>\n   , very different claims of judicial estoppel were summarily rejected without the need for extensive analysis.

App. 2014). If a party's positions can be reconciled, there is no need to protect the integrity of the judicial process from inconsistent positions. Thus, Missouri courts routinely reject invitations to apply judicial estoppel upon determining that two positions are not clearly inconsistent.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Parrott v.

Determining whether two positions are \"clearly inconsistent\" requires interpreting the allegedly contrary representations in context, identifying the underlying legal positions they represent, and analyzing whether those positions can be reconciled.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Berger v.

App. 2016). Here, this requires analysis of the context in which Schaeffler Group USA represented to the CIT that FAG Bearings had been \"absorbed\" into Schaeffler Group USA \"by change of name and/or merger.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In its 2006 lawsuit, Schaeffler Group USA alleged that a 1989 Department of Commerce antidumping order declared the domestic ball-bearings industry materially injured by foreign competitors' dumping practices, and the U.S. Bureau of Customs and Border Protection began collecting antidumping duties. The Continued Dumping and Subsidy Offset Act (CDSOA), enacted in 2000, permitted \"affected domestic producers\" to claim a share of the antidumping duties, but limited this benefit to an \"affected domestic producer\" that \"was a petitioner or interested party in support of the petition with respect to which an antidumping duty order ... has been entered, and remains in operation.\" 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1675c(b)(1)(A)-(B). FAG Bearings, though a member of the injured industry, had not supported the petition that led to the 1989 order. Schaeffler Group USA alleged that the CDSOA's petition-support requirement was unconstitutional and therefore it was entitled to FAG Bearings' \"share of CDSOA disbursements for fiscal years 2004 and 2005.\" The CIT denied relief but accepted Schaeffler Group USA's representation that it would have been entitled to FAG Bearings' share had the claim prevailed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The district court concluded that Schaeffler Group USA's claim to recover antidumping duties to which FAG Bearings was entitled was necessarily a representation that Schaeffler Group USA is a legal successor to FAG Bearings, a representation \"clearly inconsistent\" with its position denying successor liability for Kirk's tort claims based on FAG Bearings' pre-acquisition conduct. As a general matter of corporate law, we find no clear inconsistency inherent in an acquiring corporation claiming that it has succeeded to the acquired company's claim to a government benefit and also claiming that it did not assume the acquired company's liabilities. Under Missouri law, even if all or substantially all of FAG Bearings' assets were acquired, this fact alone would not constitute a merger nor transfer FAG Bearings' liabilities to Schaeffler Group USA.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Edwards v.

Customs regulations implementing the CDSOA provide:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   In the case of a company that has succeeded to the\n   <em>\n    operations\n   </em>\n   of a predecessor company that appeared on the USITC list, the successor company may\n   file a certification to claim an offset as an affected domestic producer on behalf of the predecessor company. In its certification, the company must name the predecessor company to which it has succeeded and it must describe in detail the duly authorized succession by which it is entitled to file the certification.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=19%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20159.61\">\n    19 C.F.R. \u00a7 159.61\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1)(i) (emphasis added). The regulations do not further define \"successor company\" or what constitutes \"authorized succession.\" The reference to \"operations\" suggests, consistent with the purpose of antidumping duties, that the successorship issue was focused more on domestic ball-bearing production assets than on the way those assets were acquired and owned.

Schaeffler Group USA did not explain what it meant by the ambiguous words \"merger\" and \"absorbed.\" Given the focus of antidumping duties on domestic producing assets, that was doubtless of little importance to the CIT, particularly in an order denying relief on the merits. Had the issue been fully litigated under the Customs regulation, Schaeffler Group USA would have had to \"describe in detail [its] duly authorized succession,\" and the CIT would have determined whether Schaeffler Group USA was a \"successor\" to FAG Bearings' claim for CDSOA distributions, applying an antidumping law standard that would not necessarily make Schaeffler Group USA a successor to FAG Bearings' liability for pre-acquisition torts under Missouri law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The district court erred in applying judicial estoppel based on Schaeffler Group USA's pleading before the CIT. The court stated it is \"black letter law\" that a parent corporation has no standing to assert a subsidiary's claims. That is doubtless true in many contexts, but it is not \"clearly\" applicable to the unique regulatory claim at issue before the CIT. When a party's position is not clearly inconsistent with the position taken in another proceeding, \"there is no reason to estop it from asserting that position.\"\n   <em>\n    Hossaini v. W. Mo.

But Judge Shepherd in dissent concludes that judicial estoppel is properly invoked because Schaeffler asserted that FAG Bearings \"has no distinct corporate existence,\" contrary to its position in this case that Schaeffler Group USA is not liable for the torts of its subsidiary, FAG Bearings, LLC. We disagree for numerous reasons. First, the Connecticut litigation context. Schaeffler Group USA and FAG Bearings Corporation were brought into a jet engine malfunction damage action as additional defendants when discovery revealed that engine bearings may have been manufactured by \"FAG Germany.\" Their motion for summary judgment was based on the fact that neither \"had any relationship to the bearings\" in question-the separate German corporation was not a subsidiary of Schaeffler Group USA, and FAG Bearings Corporation was not a \"distinct legal entity ... subject to suit.\" Second, after the 2005 conversion, it was FAG Bearings, LLC that survived as Schaeffler Group USA's wholly-owned subsidiary, not FAG Bearings Corporation, so the representation that \"FAG Bearings Corp., does not exist as a separate legal entity\" was accurate. Third, the memorandum did not assert that FAG Bearings, LLC was an \"unincorporated division.\" It simply cited that aspect of Connecticut law to illustrate that a non-entity lacks the capacity to be sued. Fourth, and most important, Schaeffler Group USA and FAG Bearings were voluntarily dismissed from the action before the Connecticut court ruled on their motion, so Schaeffler Group USA did not \"obtain[ ] benefits from that position in that [proceeding],\"\n   <em>\n    State Board\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8209682\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/256/48/#p54\">\n    256 S.W.3d at 54\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Schaeffler Group USA did not take \"clearly inconsistent\" positions in the CIT litigation considered by the district court, or in the Connecticut litigation on which Judge Shepherd bases his dissent. Nor do the other\n   <em>\n    New Hampshire\n   </em>\n   factors warrant invoking the equitable doctrine of judicial estoppel. Schaeffler Group USA's unopposed position that was accepted by the CIT did not mislead that court nor result in a benefit to Schaeffler Group USA other than \"standing\" to assert FAG Bearings' unsuccessful claim. Nor did Schaeffler's attempt to clarify the legal status of FAG Bearings Corporation in 2008 mislead the district court in Connecticut or benefit Schaeffler Group USA. Any disadvantage to Kirk from allowing Schaeffler Group USA to assert its position in this case will result from Missouri law limiting a parent corporation's liability for the torts of its subsidiary, not from Schaeffler Group USA playing \"fast and loose\" with the courts. For these reasons, we conclude the district court abused its discretion in ruling that Schaeffler Group USA is judicially estopped to deny successor liability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n   </strong>\n   The remaining question is the relief to which Schaeffler Group USA is entitled on appeal. Schaeffler argues the district court should have dismissed this defendant because Kirk failed to meet her burden of proving successor liability. The district court simply noted that Kirk's \"failure to plead piercing the corporate veil or [her] inability to show alter ego liability is irrelevant if judicial estoppel applies.\" Kirk's appeal brief did not address this issue. We conclude it is proper to direct Schaeffler Group USA's dismissal because the summary judgment record warranted that relief as a matter of law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nat'l Farmers Union Std.

However, the separate evidence submitted on punitive damages took only two of the sixteen trial days and focused on FAG Bearings' lack of cooperation with the government from 1991 to 1998, including its failure to warn. That evidence was relevant to both theories of liability, and since Kirk presented a submissible case as to both, the question of punitive damages may be submitted anew to a jury without retrying the issues of liability and compensatory damages as well. Likewise, Kirk's compensatory damages case was based entirely on FAG Bearings' conduct, so dismissal of Schaeffler Group USA does not affect that award. In these circumstances, we conclude that remand for a partial new trial limited to the issue of FAG Bearings, LLC's punitive damages liability is appropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

At trial, Kirk presented extensive expert testimony and reports addressing these issues. Based on their research, Dr. Kathleen Gilbert and Dr. Thomas Zizic opined that exposure to TCE causes AIH. Hydrologist Lorne G. Everett, a TCE contamination expert, testified that he had never seen higher levels of TCE contamination than at the Newton County Wells Site (the contamination zone at issue), and that Kirk was exposed to significant levels of TCE throughout her early childhood. Based on this exposure, Dr. Gilbert and Dr. Zizic specifically opined that TCE caused Kirk's AIH.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   1. On appeal, Schaeffler first argues that Kirk failed to prove causation in fact because Dr. Gilbert and Dr. Zizic failed to establish she was exposed to a level or quantity of TCE significant enough to cause her AIH, as in\n   <em>\n    Wright v.

The issue is difficult because AIH is a rare disease and what causes it has not been clearly established. While it is a known carcinogen that\n   can cause many health issues, TCE has never been definitively identified as the cause of AIH in human beings. But Dr. Gilbert and Dr. Zizic presented substantial scientific evidence tending to establish that exposure to TCE can cause AIH, and Dr. Everett testified to extensive TCE contamination in the Silver Creek community and the many ways Kirk was exposed to that contamination for many years.

As to Dr. Gilbert, the court explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   Dr. Gilbert's opinion is not connected to the existing data merely by her own empty assertion. It relies on a significant amount of admissible evidence to posit that [Kirk] was exposed to a significant level of TCE both in utero and while growing up in Silver Creek, by ingesting, inhaling, and absorbing TCE through her skin. While Dr. Gilbert's report does not estimate an exact level of exposure, it explains why such an estimate is not possible. It also provides a reliable basis for her opinion that [Kirk's] exposure to TCE was such that, over time, acting on a genetic predisposition, it caused [Kirk] to develop AIH, and it was not idiopathic [i.e., of unknown cause].\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   On appeal, Schaeffler argues, as it argued to the district court, that these specific causation opinions were inadmissible because Dr. Gilbert and Dr. Zizic (i) could not systematically rule out alternative causes of Kirk's AIH; (ii) did not establish that Kirk was exposed to an amount of TCE that can cause AIH in humans; and (iii) did not adequately explain why Kirk's AIH was more likely caused by TCE exposure rather than some unknown cause. The argument is not focused on the experts' specific trial testimony, except Dr. Gilbert's testimony that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   where a young woman in a very small community is living over a Superfund\n   Site that is contaminated with TCE, and the chances of anybody in that small group getting [AIH], which is a rare disease, is very small.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   So, to me, that seemed pretty much like a no-brainer.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   A differential etiology rules in plausible causes and then systematically rules out less plausible causes until a most plausible cause emerges.

Prior to trial, the district court denied Schaeffler's motion to exclude eight government reports, explaining they were \"generally admissible\" under the public records exception to the hearsay rule.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Evid. 803(8). On appeal, Schaeffler argues the district court abused its discretion by admitting the portions of EPA and Minnesota Department of Health reports stating the public health regulatory standards for TCE, and instructing the jury that \"exceeding these numbers does not in and of itself establish causation in this case, though it may be considered by you in determining causation.\" The standards at issue are EPA's \"maximum contaminant level\" under the Safe Drinking Water Act of five parts per billion, and a Minnesota Health Department \"Guidance for Drinking Water\" of 0.4 parts per billion TCE.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   We have little doubt the regulatory standards were probative evidence, to be compared to the concentrations of TCE found in Silver Creek wells in addressing the levels of TCE contamination to which residents were exposed. But whether exceeding the concentrations set forth in those regulatory standards was direct evidence of general and specific causation is a different question, as the district court initially recognized. Regulatory standards express risk assessments that are designed to protect public health. \"[A] regulatory standard, rather than being a measure of causation, is a public-health exposure level that an agency determines pursuant to statutory standards.\"\n   <em>\n    Sutera v.

Const. art. V, \u00a7 2 (\"The supreme court shall be the highest court in the state ... [i]ts decisions shall be controlling in all other courts.\"). In its last opinion articulating a standard for judicial estoppel, the Supreme Court of Missouri opted for a general formulation: \"[j]udicial estoppel will lie to prevent litigants from taking a position, under oath, in one judicial proceeding, thereby obtaining benefits from that position in that instance and later, in a second proceeding, taking a contrary position in order to obtain benefits ... at that time.\"\n   <em>\n    State Board\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8209682\" index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/256/48/#p54\">\n    256 S.W.3d at 54\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (second alteration in original) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Just as instructive as the\n   <em>\n    State Board\n   </em>\n   formulation is the\n   <em>\n    State Board\n   </em>\n   analysis. There, it was alleged that a \"representation\" made in a prior brief estopped a party from making an argument. The\n   <em>\n    State Board\n   </em>\n   court was not concerned with factors other courts have held to be decisive, including (1) whether the opposing party relied on the statement,\n   <em>\n    cf.\n   </em>\n   18B Charles Alan Wright &amp; Arthur R.

Instead, its analysis was straightforward: it simply looked at whether the \"representation\" in the prior proceeding foreclosed the party's position in the suit before it.\n   <em>\n    State Board\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8209682\" index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/256/48/#p54\">\n    256 S.W.3d at 55\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding that prior representation was general in nature and did not \"purport to draw a legal conclusion,\" meaning it did not foreclose the party's argument in the current proceeding).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   All this is to say that the Supreme Court of Missouri has adopted an analytic framework, binding on us, of judicial estoppel that is less focused on rigid requirements and more on \"preserv[ing] the dignity of the courts.\"\n   <em>\n    Edwards v. Durham\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10153899\" index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/346/90/#p101\">\n    346 S.W.2d 90\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 101 (Mo. 1961). This approach is not unique.

And thus our inquiry, as mandated by the Supreme Court of Missouri, should be exactly that: has Schaeffler \"tak[en] a contrary position [to one it has taken previously] in order to obtain benefits\" in this case?\n   <em>\n    State Board\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8209682\" index=\"127\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/256/48/#p54\">\n    256 S.W.3d at 54\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   I believe we can answer that question in the affirmative, which brings me to the prior representations made by Schaeffler. There are two representations in the record, one made before the Court of International Trade, and one made in the District of Connecticut.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The majority makes a plausible case that the former is not a \"contrary position.\" The majority attempts to say the same with regards to the latter. By contrast, I find the latter representation to be decisive evidence of Schaeffler \"toying with the courts.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   As a threshold matter, the majority suggests that, under\n   <em>\n    State Board\n   </em>\n   , Schaeffler did not \"obtain[ ] benefits\" from the position it took before the district court in Connecticut because it was voluntarily dismissed. This is a mischaracterization of\n   <em>\n    State Board\n   </em>\n   . The pertinent portion of the\n   <em>\n    State Board\n   </em>\n   formulation, again, is \"[j]udicial estoppel will lie to prevent litigants from taking a position, under oath, in one judicial proceeding,\n   <em>\n    thereby\n   </em>\n   obtaining benefits.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8209682\" index=\"128\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/256/48/#p54\">\n    256 S.W.3d at 54\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). The \"benefit[ ],\" as defined by\n   <em>\n    State Board\n   </em>\n   , is being able to take a litigating position under oath in court as Schaeffler did in the district court in Connecticut.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Thereby\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Black's Law Dictionary\n   </em>\n   (10th ed. 2014) (defining \"thereby\" as \"[b]y that means\" or \"in that way\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   On the substance, the majority argues that Schaeffler represented to the district court in Connecticut that \"FAG Bearings Corporation\" lacked the capacity to be sued. So, because \"FAG Bearings, LLC\"-not \"FAG Bearings Corporation\"-\"survived as Schaeffler's wholly-owned subsidiary,\" the majority finds no inconsistency with the representation made here by Schaeffler: FAG Bearings, LLC is a distinct corporate entity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   The majority does not grapple, however, with the core of Schaeffler's position in the Connecticut proceeding. After Schaeffler acknowledged FAG Bearings converted from a corporation to an LLC, it gave its bottom line: \" 'FAG Bearings' is an assumed name or a 'd/b/a' under which Schaeffler sometimes conducts business ... [i]t has no distinct corporate existence.\" D. Conn. Motion at 2.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   It is true that before asserting that FAG Bearings had \"no distinct corporate existence,\" Schaeffler referred to it as a \"wholly-owned subsidiary of Schaeffler.\" D. Conn. Motion at 2. As the majority correctly notes, even if \"Schaeffler acquired all or substantially all of FAG Bearings' assets, this fact alone would not ... transfer FAG Bearings' liabilities to Schaeffler.\" There are, however, broad-based exceptions to this, including \"when the purchaser is merely a continuation of the seller.\"\n   <em>\n    Edwards v.

Ct. App. 2013). Thus, where \"the business operations are identical\" and the \"transferee\n   uses ... [the] name of the transferor,\" continuation will typically be found.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State ex rel. Family Support Div. v.

It argued that FAG Bearings \"sold all of its assets except for some land and buildings\" to Schaeffler. D. Conn. Motion at 2. And, critically, it argued that \" 'FAG Bearings' is an assumed name or a 'd/b/a.' \" D. Conn. Motion at 2. Add that to Schaeffler's unqualified assertion that FAG Bearings \"has no distinct corporate existence,\" D. Conn.

But given that we have decided not to remand, I believe that the majority errs in reversing the district court's judicial estoppel determination. Because this is the only reason the majority dismisses Schaeffler and reverses the punitive damages verdict, I do not believe those actions are warranted. Instead, I would uphold both the compensatory and punitive damages verdicts in full against both Schaeffler and FAG Bearings. Thus, I join in Sections II.B and II.C of the majority opinion, which upholds the compensatory damages verdict against FAG Bearings, but respectfully dissent from the rest of the opinion.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-94\">\n    The majority deems it significant that the Supreme Court of Missouri once cited the U.S. Supreme Court for a general formulation of judicial estoppel.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Taylor v.
