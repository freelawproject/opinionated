Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On August 4, 2014, after being arrested, Norman Whitney, Jr. (\"Whitney\") was taken to the St. Louis University Hospital for treatment of an irregular heartbeat.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   While there, he attempted to escape and said that he wanted the police to take his life so that he would not be sent back to prison. He was evaluated and determined to be suicidal. After being treated by psychiatry and showing improvement, he was released as fit for confinement and transported to the St. Louis City Justice Center on August 8, 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On August 10, 2014, Whitney was moved to a medical unit in the Justice Center because he was suffering from a number of medical conditions, including (1) detoxification from heroin use, (2) congestive heart failure, (3) hypertension, and (4) diabetes mellitus.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Sharp was assigned to monitor Whitney in his cell via closed-circuit television. Sharp last saw Whitney pacing by the shower area at 9:05 a.m. Sometime within the next fourteen minutes, she discovered that he had hanged himself with a ligature made from his ripped hospital gown.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   After Whitney's death, an unnamed medical practitioner at the Justice Center came forward to report that Whitney had mentioned having suicidal ideation to him. There is no evidence that this information was relayed to Sharp or other jail personnel prior to Whitney's death. Whitney denied suicidal ideation when asked by other correctional officers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Whitney's father brought an action in Missouri state court against Sharp, in both her official and individual capacities, as well as the City of St. Louis, asserting claims under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and the Missouri wrongful death act. The action was removed to federal court pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201331\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The complaint alleges that Sharp caused Whitney's death through her deliberate indifference by failing to: (1) \"adequately monitor Whitney;\" (2) \"timely provide adequate medical care to his serious suicidal medical condition and need;\" and/or (3) \"timely intervene to rescue Whitney while he was committing suicide in the CCTV cell.\" The claim against the City is based on the City's failure \"to have a policy of constant surveillance under the circumstances of Whitney's incarceration.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Sharp and the City filed motions to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The district court granted the motions, dismissed with prejudice the \u00a7 1983 claims against both defendants, and dismissed without prejudice the state law claims against both defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Whitney Sr. claims the district court erred (1) when it held that the complaint did not adequately plead deliberate indifference in his claim against Sharp, and (2) when it held that the City could not be liable under \u00a7 1983 in the absence of a constitutional violation by Sharp.

He claims that\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   liability is still possible because other jail personnel who were not named as defendants \"arguably fulfilled a 'do nothing' Jail policy vis-a-vis an inmate committing suicide.\" This claim fails for the same reason as the claim against Sharp. The complaint alleges that unnamed jail personnel were deliberately indifferent while Whitney was hanging himself. Tellingly, the complaint does not allege any facts to support this legal conclusion. The surmise of the allegation is unsupported by sufficient factual allegations. There is, for example, no claim that any identifiable jail official had knowledge that Whitney was in the process of committing suicide or even that a particular jail official suspected that he might be committing an act of self-harm. In short the complaint fails to allege any constitutional violation arising out of a municipal policy that would expose the City to\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   liability.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    III.
