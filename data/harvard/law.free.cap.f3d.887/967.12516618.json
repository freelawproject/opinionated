Echlin received treatment at PeaceHealth on two different occasions but never paid the nearly $1,000 in medical bills she incurred as a result. After Echlin ignored multiple requests for payment, PeaceHealth referred her delinquent accounts to Computer Credit, Inc. (CCI), a purported collection agency, for further action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   For a number of years, CCI and PeaceHealth operated together under a \"Subscriber Agreement\" signed in 2004. Under the agreement, PeaceHealth would refer delinquent patient accounts to CCI and, for a fixed fee, CCI would perform various services related to the debt-collection process-primarily mailing letters demanding that the patients pay their bills. During the time that an account had been referred to CCI, PeaceHealth would suspend its in-house collection efforts.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   When it referred an account to CCI, PeaceHealth would give CCI the debtor's name and address, the name of any guarantor, the date of the service in question, and the amount owed on the account. CCI would then independently screen each account for potential collection problems (such as staleness of the claim). CCI's screening process was mostly automated, though a CCI employee would personally review at least some of the accounts for red flags. If an account passed CCI's screening process, CCI would then send the debtor a letter advising her that the account had been assigned to CCI for collection purposes and demanding payment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   CCI controlled the largely formulaic letter-mailing process. Although PeaceHealth was generally aware of the standard format of CCI's letters, CCI alone controlled the content of the letters it actually sent, and CCI did not seek PeaceHealth's approval prior to mailing. The letters were written on CCI letterhead, they were mailed from CCI's in-house mailing center, and they listed CCI's address and phone number (along with PeaceHealth's contact information under a section labeled \"Creditor Detail\"). The letters also directed debtors to visit a website maintained by CCI, where one could see more details about his or her debt, find information about how to repay or to dispute the debt, and submit electronic documents to CCI. Like the letters, the website encouraged debtors to contact CCI by phone, fax, or mail with questions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   CCI would mail up to two collection letters for each PeaceHealth account. The first letter informed the debtor that her account had been referred to CCI, \"a debt collector,\" for collection and requested payment either by check, by a credit card form included in the letter, or online at PeaceHealth's website. CCI itself had no ability to process or to negotiate payments for PeaceHealth, but it would forward to PeaceHealth any payments it received, including endorsing checks made out to CCI, as necessary. CCI typically allowed the debtor two weeks to respond to its first letter. If a debtor made full repayment, CCI stopped all collection activity. But if the debtor failed to pay or to respond\n   within two weeks, CCI would send a second letter, renewing its request that the debtor settle the account. If, after another two to three weeks, the debtor still had not paid her debt, CCI would refer the debt back to PeaceHealth and CCI's activity on the account would end.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Accounts sent back to PeaceHealth would often then be referred to another company for additional action. As PeaceHealth describes it, CCI's activities were the first step in a series of collections processes \"up to and including the point of an additional agency obtaining and executing on a court judgment.\" CCI did not participate in any of the later collection steps.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   CCI also handled correspondence-both in writing and over the phone-from PeaceHealth debtors. In 2013, for instance, CCI received 440 pieces of mail from PeaceHealth debtors. When it received such mail, CCI would \"review, act on it, copy it,\" and then forward it to PeaceHealth, though CCI would not necessarily respond directly to the debtor herself. For example, when it received written requests for debt verification, CCI would contact PeaceHealth to verify the validity of the debt and then either PeaceHealth or CCI would send a letter responding to the debtor. CCI also trained its staff personally to handle phone inquiries from debtors, and CCI's Collections Manager estimated that CCI handled approximately 500 calls a week from debtors for all of its clients combined.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   CCI personnel gave a variety of information to callers, including clarifying basic details about their debts, assisting in understanding their insurance benefits, advising them to look into charity programs for assistance in paying, and explaining the distinction between a payment plan and a partial payment. CCI did not generally reach out to debtors beyond the two letters, but CCI personnel would return calls to debtors if requested, and CCI sent debtors various administrative notices, such as payment or account-closure confirmations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In early April 2013, PeaceHealth sent Echlin's information to CCI for assistance in collecting the debt from her first treatment at PeaceHealth. On April 4, CCI assigned Echlin's debt a CCI account number and screened it for barriers to collection. The next day, CCI sent an initial collection letter to Echlin demanding payment. The letter was written in the form described above and stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   Your overdue balance with PeaceHealth ... has been referred to [CCI] for collection. ... This letter will serve to inform you that your account remains unpaid and we expect resolution of your obligation to [PeaceHealth].\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The letter directed Echlin to remit payment in order to \"prevent further collection activity by\" CCI. It also instructed her to notify CCI within 30 days if she disputed the validity of the debt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Having received no response, CCI sent a second letter to Echlin exactly two weeks later. The second letter was substantially the same as the first but included the additional notice:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   This is our FINAL NOTICE and you must take action to resolve this overdue account. Pay the amount due to discharge your debt owed to [PeaceHealth]. ... [T]his is our LAST ATTEMPT to collect this debt ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Echlin neither responded nor paid the debt, and CCI returned the account to PeaceHealth on May 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   CCI later sent Echlin another initial collection letter, seeking payment from her second visit to PeaceHealth. This time, Echlin sent a letter to CCI disputing the debt. CCI never responded to Echlin's letter but instead marked the account disputed, determined that all further collection activity should stop, and returned the account along with Echlin's letter to PeaceHealth.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   C\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   On March 11, 2014, Echlin filed a putative class action\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   against CCI and PeaceHealth, alleging violations of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA), \"including but not limited to 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1692e and 1692j.\" Specifically, Echlin alleged that the letters she received \"created a false or misleading belief that Defendant CCI was meaningfully involved in the collection of a debt prior to the debt actually being sent to collections\"-a practice commonly known as flat-rating. She sought statutory damages, actual damages, and attorneys fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   CCI and PeaceHealth moved for summary judgment. In response to CCI's motion, Echlin continued to press her flat-rating claims but also argued that, even if such claims failed, \"CCI's practices violate the statute in other ways.\" She gave one example, echoing a prohibition found in 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692e(5) : \"For instance, the FDCPA prohibits a debt collector from using any false representation or deceptive means to collect any debt and threatening to take any action that cannot legally be taken or that is not intended to be taken.\" Echlin argued that CCI violated such prohibition by threatening \" 'further' action against Mrs. Echlin if she refused to pay her debt, but CCI had no actual authority to take\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   action against [her] outside of sending a second demand letter.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The district court granted CCI's and PeaceHealth's motions for summary judgment. It ruled that the undisputed evidence showed that CCI indeed\n   <em>\n    did\n   </em>\n   meaningfully participate in the collection of Echlin's debt, thereby precluding any flat-rating claim. The court also struck the \u00a7 1692e(5) claim Echlin argued at summary judgment, explaining that Echlin had not fairly raised such a claim in her complaint and thus the defendants had no notice of the claim and would have been substantially prejudiced if she were allowed to add the new claim so far into litigation. Although Echlin did not formally move to amend her complaint, the court further determined that any amendment would be futile, because at that point the new claim would have been barred by the FDCPA's one-year statute of limitations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   D\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Echlin timely appealed and challenges the district court's rejection of both her flat-rating claims and her \u00a7 1692e(5) claim for CCI's allegedly false threats to take\n   further collection action against her. She also argues that she has a viable claim under \u00a7 1692e(10) for CCI's allegedly deceptive inclusion of both its and PeaceHealth's contact information in the letters it sent her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Echlin first argues that the district court erred in granting summary judgment against her flat-rating claim that CCI's letters \"created a false or misleading belief that Defendant CCI was meaningfully involved in the collection of [her] debt prior to the debt actually being sent to collections,\" in violation of 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692j.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Section 1692j prohibits a practice known as flat-rating, whereby a third-party (usually for a flat rate) sells form letters to a creditor, \"which create[ ] the false impression that someone (usually a collection agency) besides the actual creditor is 'participating' in collecting the debt.\"\n   <em>\n    White v.

As the Seventh Circuit has described, the deception in such a practice lies in giving debtors the false impression that, by involving a third party in the collection process, \"the creditor does not intend to drop the matter,\" and \"Congress's concern was that such deception might induce debtors to abandon legitimate defenses.\"\n   <em>\n    White\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4232326\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/200/1016/#p1018\">\n    200 F.3d at 1018\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

There is no doubt that CCI furnished form letters that were used to create the belief-indeed that explicitly stated-that CCI was participating in an attempt to collect the debts Echlin owed to PeaceHealth. The question we must answer is whether there is sufficient evidence in the record to support Echlin's contention that this impression was\n   <em>\n    false\n   </em>\n   -that is, whether there is any genuine issue of fact as to whether CCI actually participated in PeaceHealth's debt-collection efforts.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11349193\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/307/623/#p639\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nielsen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11349193\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/307/623/#p639\">\n    307 F.3d at 640\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"The premise of liability under section 1692j... is that the 'flat-rater' is\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   involved in debt collection.\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The statute does not define what it means for a person to \"participat[e] in the collection of or in an attempt to collect a debt\" owed by the consumer. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692j(a). A \"debt,\" of course, is an obligation to pay someone money.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692a(5) ;\n   <em>\n    Ho v.

And to \"collect\" that debt simply means to \"gather\" or to \"exact\" it from the debtor.\n   <em>\n    See Webster's Third New International Dictionary\n   </em>\n   444 (1993);\n   <em>\n    Vincent v.

But this does little to answer our question. There is no doubt that Echlin owed a debt to PeaceHealth and that PeaceHealth was trying to collect it from her. One could \"participate\" in-i.e., \"take part\" in,\n   <em>\n    Webster's Third New International Dictionary\n   </em>\n   1646 (1993)-that effort in any number of ways. Arguably, CCI participated in the attempts to collect Echlin's debts by doing so little as drafting and mailing the collection letters to her itself, rather than merely supplying letterhead to PeaceHealth for mailing.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Vincent\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3727054,3667006\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/736/88/\">\n    736 F.3d at 116\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Livingston, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (\"[The statute's] language clearly anticipates that a flat-rater does not itself communicate with debtors. ...

The Second Circuit, for example, has suggested that the relevant entity must \"meaningfully\" participate in debt collection activities rather than \"merely operat[e] as a conduit for a collection process that the creditor controls.\"\n   <em>\n    Vincent\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3727054,3667006\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/736/88/\">\n    736 F.3d at 101, 103\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted). The court opined that this likely requires more than mailing form letters at the direction of a creditor, criticizing arguments to the contrary as a relying on a \"hyper-technical\" reading of the statute.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3727054,3667006\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/736/88/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3727054,3667006\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/736/88/\">\n    at 101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Seventh Circuit has likewise suggested that a debt collector must \"genuine[ly]\" participate in the collection process and wrote that \u00a7 1692j\"bars the practice ... in which an individual sends a delinquency letter to the debtor portraying himself as a debt collector, when in fact he has no real involvement in the debt collection effort.\"\n   <em>\n    Nielsen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11349193\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/307/623/#p639\">\n    307 F.3d at 635, 639\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The district court found that CCI \"meaningfully\" participated in debt collection activities under \u00a7 1692j. The record supports that ruling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Echlin primarily argues that CCI did not meaningfully participate in the attempts to collect her debts because CCI did not engage in many of the hallmark activities of debt collection. For example, CCI did not have authority to negotiate or to process payments from debtors, it received no proceeds from payments that were made, and it was not involved in any further action that was pursued against debtors whose accounts remained delinquent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   We are not persuaded that CCI must engage in such more central debt-collection activities in order to participate meaningfully in that process. Meaningful participation in the debt-collection process may take a variety of forms. In similar cases, for example, lower courts have applied a litany of factors related to an entity's participation in the debt-collection process, including the amount of control the entity exercises over the collection letters it sends, the amount of contact the entity has with debtors, whether the entity invites and responds to debtor inquiries, whether the entity may receive or negotiate payments, whether the entity receives or retains full debtor files, and whether the entity is involved in further collection activities if the debts remain unpaid.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Hartley v. Suburban Radiologic Consultants, Ltd.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4261319\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/295/357/#p371\">\n    295 F.R.D. 357\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 371-72 (D.

Such considerations are surely not exhaustive of the ways in which one might meaningfully participate in the collection process, but we agree that activities of such sorts may evidence genuine involvement in the collection process and that our inspection of an entity's collection efforts must be holistic. The key is whether, in consideration of all that an entity does in the collection process, it genuinely contributes to an effort to collect another's debt, or instead does little more than act as a mailing service for the creditor.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Vincent\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3727054,3667006\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/736/88/\">\n    736 F.3d at 103\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[T]he appropriate inquiry is whether the third party ... merely operat[es] as a conduit for a collection process that the creditor controls.\" (internal quotation marks omitted) );\n   <em>\n    Hartley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4261319\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/295/357/#p371\">\n    295 F.R.D. at 371\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (flat-rater does \"little more than coordinate the mailing of letters and forward responses to the creditor\");\n   <em>\n    Peters v.

Undisputed evidence in the record shows that: (1) CCI independently screened accounts for barriers to collection; (2) CCI alone drafted and mailed the collection letters, without input from PeaceHealth; (3) the letters invited debtors to contact CCI by mail or phone and CCI trained its personnel to handle such inquiries; (4) CCI in fact received approximately 500 calls a week from debtors of its various clients and received several hundred pieces of mail from PeaceHealth debtors; (5) in their conversations with debtors, CCI staff provided a variety of information about their debts and how to repay them; (6) CCI maintained a website where PeaceHealth debtors could access individualized information about their debts and submit documents to CCI; and (7) CCI sometimes received and forwarded to PeaceHealth payments it received from debtors. Certainly, CCI could have been more directly interested in the outcome of\n   PeaceHealth's attempts to collect on patients' debts.

As the district court recognized, Echlin's complaint focused narrowly on her flat-rating allegations. The complaint alleged that CCI \"was not acting as a debt collector ... [but instead] was acting as a flat-rater.\" It elaborated in detail, alleging that PeaceHealth instructed CCI to send the letters to create the false impression that Echlin's debt had been \"sent to collections\" and that PeaceHealth \"employed Defendant CCI's letterhead and identity as a collection agency in an attempt to deceive Plaintiff\" about CCI's role in the process. The complaint cited \u00a7 1692j three times and alleged specifically that the letters \"created a false or misleading belief that Defendant CCI was meaningfully involved in the collection of a debt prior to the debt actually being sent to collections in violation of 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1692e and 1692j.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   By contrast, the complaint never cited \u00a7 1692e(5), nor did it mention the FDCPA's prohibition against threatening to take an action that is not intended or legally authorized. The complaint's only references to \u00a7 1692e at all were made in direct connection with Echlin's \u00a7 1692j flat-rating allegations; indeed, as explained above, Echlin has throughout argued general violations of \u00a7 1692e that mirror her \u00a7 1692j allegations.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   n.5. Although the complaint alleged that PeaceHealth was acting as a \"debt collector\" under the FDCPA-a necessary requirement for any claim under \u00a7 1692e, including of course a claim under \u00a7 1692e(5) -it did\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   allege that CCI was. In fact, the complaint expressly disavowed such a claim, alleging that CCI \"was not acting as a debt collector when it sent the Letters.\" This makes sense, as the complaint's sole theory of liability was that CCI was merely a flat-rater, not a true debt collector. But it is manifestly contrary to Echlin's suggestion that her complaint claimed that CCI's conduct also violated \u00a7 1692e(5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   The closest the complaint comes to suggesting anything resembling Echlin's \u00a7 1692e(5) argument is in its alleging that CCI \"was not authorized to take legal action regarding the alleged debts.\" Critically, however, the complaint does not allege that CCI ever threatened to take legal action despite its lack of authority to do so. In other words, the complaint does not allege the minimum facts needed to support a \u00a7 1692e(5) claim against CCI, even if one were intended. This, again, is not surprising, because Echlin's allegation\n   that CCI lacked authority to take legal action has consistently been cited to support her contention that CCI was merely a flat-rater.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   In sum, the district court did not err in concluding that Echlin's complaint and its focus on flat-rating failed to give CCI fair notice of her later-argued \u00a7 1692e(5) claim. Echlin's attempt to add such a claim at the summary judgment stage is impermissible.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Navajo Nation v.

Although Echlin never filed a formal motion for leave to amend, the district court concluded that amendment would be futile, because, at that point, any such claim would have been barred by the FDCPA's one-year statute of limitations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692k(d). Echlin concedes that the statute of limitations would generally bar a new \u00a7 1692e(5) claim, but she contends that the amended claim should \"relate back\" to the date of her original complaint. Echlin failed to make such an argument to the district court, but her argument fails in any event.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(c), an amendment to a complaint may \"relate[ ] back\" to the date of the original complaint where it \"asserts a claim or defense that arose out of the conduct, transaction, or occurrence set out-or attempted to be set out-in the original pleading.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(c)(1)(B). The claims must \"share a common core of operative facts such that the plaintiff will rely on the same evidence to prove each claim.\"\n   <em>\n    Williams v.

As discussed above, Echlin's complaint failed to allege at least two facts critical to support a \u00a7 1692e(5) claim: (1) that CCI is a debt collector under the Act and (2) that CCI threatened to take any action against her that it had no authority or intention to take. As we have noted, the first point is in fact directly contradictory to the allegations of Echlin's complaint, and thus would naturally turn on questions not presented by those original allegations. And the second point would likewise turn on different evidence than Echlin's flat-rating claims, as it focuses on the specific representations made in the letters rather than the nature of CCI's role in the collection process.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   To find in Echlin's favor, the trier of fact would be called to interpret what, if anything, CCI's letters threaten to do and whether CCI planned to follow through on those threats-questions that simply are not presented by Echlin's flat-rating\n   claims. CCI might well have called different witnesses or pursued a different litigation strategy to defend against such issues. Indeed, CCI contends that it waived certain defenses arguably available to it specifically because it understood Echlin only to be raising flat-rating claims in this lawsuit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   In short, the district court did not err in concluding that CCI would have been \"substantially prejudiced by undertaking an entirely new course of defense based on these [ \u00a7 1692e(5) ] allegations\" so far into litigation. Any amendment to add Echlin's materially different \u00a7 1692e(5) claim would not relate back to the date of Echlin's original complaint, and would therefore be time-barred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   IV\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Finally, Echlin argues that CCI also violated \u00a7 1692e(10), because its letters deceptively included contact information for both CCI and PeaceHealth and \"fail[ed] to clarify whether she should communicate with and pay CCI or PeaceHealth.\" Echlin failed to raise this argument at any point prior to this appeal. Such a claim is nowhere to be found in Echlin's complaint, and she did not even bother to argue it when opposing the motions for summary judgment.

Despite Echlin's reference to both statutory subsections, for ease of discussion we (like the district court before us) refer to Echlin's argument as a claim for a violation of \u00a7 1692e(5), because she focused on the specific type of conduct prohibited by that subsection.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-84\">\n    Echlin also alleged that the same conduct violated \u00a7 1692e's prohibition against a \"debt collector\" using \"any false, deceptive, or misleading representation or means in connection with the collection of any debt.\" The Act defines a \"debt collector\" as a person who \"regularly collects or attempts to collect ... debts owed or due ... another.\" 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692a(6). Thus, if CCI were acting merely as a flat-rater (and not actually participating in the collection of debts), it would be liable for violations of \u00a7 1692j, but would not likely be a \"debt collector\" and thus not liable\n    <em>\n     also\n    </em>\n    for violations of \u00a7 1692e.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     Vincent v.

Some courts have held that this standard is essentially the inverse of \u00a7 1692j : a creditor who deceives debtors by hiring a third-party flat-rater is the de facto debt collector and may therefore be liable for violations of \u00a7 1692e through the false-name exception.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Vincent\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3727054,3667006\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/736/88/\">\n     736 F.3d at\n    </extracted-citation>\n    103 n.16 ;\n    <em>\n     Gutierrez v.

Thus, Echlin argues, if CCI is liable for violating \u00a7 1692j, PeaceHealth is likewise liable for violating \u00a7 1692e.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-86\">\n    In any event, Echlin's \u00a7\u00a7 1692e and 1692j claims turn on the same allegation: that CCI's letters falsely suggested that CCI was \"meaningfully involved in the collection of\" her debts. Our analysis of Echlin's flat-rating claims under \u00a7 1692j therefore applies with equal force to her parallel claims of misleading representations under \u00a7 1692e.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-87\">\n    As noted above, the Second Circuit treats the \u00a7 1692a(6) false-name exception as essentially the inverse of \u00a7 1692j, and it has held that when a creditor uses the services of a flat-rater, the creditor itself can be held liable for violations of \u00a7 1692e as the de facto \"collector\" of its own debts.\n    <em>\n     See supra\n    </em>\n    n.5.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-88\">\n    Echlin appears to raise this claim against only CCI and not PeaceHealth.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"8\">\n   <p id=\"p-89\">\n    For example, at the summary judgment stage, Echlin sought to illustrate CCI's supposedly empty threats to take further action specifically by reference to representations made in the second and \"final\" letter CCI sent her on April 19, 2013, after she failed to respond to CCI's first collection letter-yet that second letter is not mentioned\n    <em>\n     at all\n    </em>\n    in Echlin's complaint.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
