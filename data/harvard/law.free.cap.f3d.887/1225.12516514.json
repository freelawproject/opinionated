Sama contends that the record compels findings that he suffered persecution and that he had a well-founded fear of being singled out for future persecution for associating with two gay friends and posting a message in a university publication condemning the treatment of gay individuals. But we disagree. The Board was entitled to find that any mistreatment that Sama suffered did not rise to the level of persecution, to find that the police investigated his mistreatment, and to rely on country reports published by the State Department that state that conditions in Cameroon are improving for gay individuals. Sama also argues that the Board denied him due process when it weighed his evidence. But due process required only notice and an opportunity to be heard, and Sama received both. We deny Sama's petition for review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This appeal arises from Che Eric Sama's most recent attempt to enter the United States. He testified that he has applied for various kinds of visas \"about five times\" and that he \"was banned from applying again\" because he submitted a bank statement that \"was not original.\" This time, he came to the United States seeking asylum,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201158\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and withholding of removal under the Immigration and Nationality Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201231\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(3), and the United Nations Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman and Degrading Treatment or Punishment,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20208.16\">\n    8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , after a friend in Nigeria told him that he \"could get out of the country and apply for asylum where [he] w[ould] be safe.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In 2015, Sama posted a message in a university publication in Cameroon \"supporting homosexuality and asking for equal rights for homosexuals.\" He testified that he protested the expulsion of two friends, Fai David and David's partner, and wrote: \"They kick them out and they are all created by God. Why, why don't you allow their rights?\" In response, the police issued a warrant for Sama's arrest that charged him with \"[t]he posting of an article on [g]ay right[s] on the [s]chool [b]oard\" and \"[c]arrying out [h]omosexual [a]ctivities.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   According to Sama, an \"anti-gay group\" attacked him at the end of November because he posted \"homosexual things.\" While he was walking home after class, four men pushed him to the ground, \"cut [his] neck,\" and warned him that he \"should stop [his] homosexual activities.\" The men told him that, \"if [he] d[id] [not] stop ..., they [we]re going to kill [him] next time they s[aw] [him.]\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Fellow students secured transportation for Sama to a hospital, where he was treated for \"[w]ounds and a big cut on [his] neck,\" a \"[h]ead ache and [s]wollen face,\" \"[s]erious[ ] [b]leeding,\" and other symptoms of an \"assault.\" While he was being treated, the hospital called the police, who came to the hospital and took a statement from Sama about the attack. Although the warrant for his arrest remained outstanding,\n   the police did not arrest him then. But his attackers were never found, which led Sama to conclude in his application for asylum that \"[no] investigation was done.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On November 25, 2015, the hospital discharged Sama, and he went to live with his cousin \"on the outskirts\" of town. On December 6, he returned to his mother's house to retrieve some belongings. While he was collecting his things, an unknown individual threw a brick through the window of his room. The brick was inscribed with the message \"we don't want gays in our community.\" Sama did not testify that he reported this incident to the police.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Two days later, the police attempted to execute the warrant for his arrest at his mother's house. When his mother refused to tell the police where Sama was, they arrested and detained her. She was released after \"about two days.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   At some point, news sources reported that David was murdered. According to the news, the police were \"making no efforts to find his killers.\" And Sama speculated that David's partner might have been kidnapped and that \"he or his body has not been found.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On December 7, Sama began his journey to the United States. He first flew to Nigeria, but he left after a friend warned him that he would not be safe there. Sama then traveled to Mexico, where his passport was stolen, and took a bus and a taxi to the United States border. The Department of Homeland Security charged Sama as an alien seeking admission without a valid entry document,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201182\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(7)(A)(i)(I), and Sama sought asylum.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   At his removal hearing, Sama introduced evidence to support his claims of persecution. He testified that he left Cameroon because his \"life was in danger.\" He stated that \"[t]he police were looking for [him] and the anti-gay group wanted to kill [him] and [he] was not safe at all.\" He also explained that \"homosexuals are treated badly,\" \"are not recognized by the community,\" and \"are perceived as evil\" in Cameroon. And Sama testified that he is not gay but that he was perceived as gay in Cameroon because of his post and his friendships.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   He submitted statements from his friends and family. Nubende Pual, a fellow student, stated that \"[t]he popular theory going around the school campus [wa]s that [Sama] was attacked because he was friendly to homosexuals and had publicize[d] comments that were homosexual friendly.\" He stated that \"[b]eing homosexual or supporting homosexuals in Cameroon is a taboo that is highly punishable by law enforcement agents and antigay groups.\" Sama's cousin, Bangeng Gideon Sama, declared that Sama had \"been warned against returning ... because of the significant likelihood that he will be arrested and tortured to dea[th] because of the previous incident and his belie[f]s.\" Another classmate of Sama's, Nutella Nelda, recounted visiting him in the hospital, where Sama told her and her boyfriend that his attackers asked why he posted the message in the university publication. Nelda also stated that Sama told them that he could not report the incident to the police because they were looking for him. And she stated that \"because the police are ... searching for him and the anti gay/lesbian mob is still at-large, there is a very high possibility that if [Sama] return[s] to Cameroon he will be hurt again and possibly kill[ed].\" Her boyfriend submitted a similar declaration. And Sama's uncle, Che Godlove, stated that he \"believe[s] [Sama] can't come back to Cameroon because the authority, anti-gay [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ] are presently looking for him.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Sama also submitted several documents, including two newspaper articles and country reports by the Department of State and Amnesty International. A 2013 State Department report stated that consensual homosexual activity is illegal and punishable by a prison sentence of six months to five years and a fine between $41 and $410 in American dollars. The report explains that, before 2013, the police \"actively enforced the law and arrested, tried, jailed, and beat alleged [lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender] individuals,\" and police officers \"cooperated with vigilante groups to entrap and arrest them.\" According to the report, lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender individuals \"regularly faced social stigmatization and mob violence, which sometimes resulted in their deaths.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   More recent reports explain that the situation in Cameroon is improving for gay individuals. For example, the 2015 State Department report concluded that \"[h]arassment of and discrimination against members of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and intersex ... community\" was \"less than in recent years,\" although the report found that it still \"continued.\" Same-sex sexual activity remained illegal, but \"reports of arrests dropped dramatically,\" and human rights organizations were advocating for decriminalization as well as defending those prosecuted. The report also stated that \"[u]nlike in previous years, there were few reports that [lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and intersex] individuals who sought protection from authorities were extorted or arrested.\" And the report described an instance in which \"[a] passing law enforcement officer rescued\" a \"transvestite individual\" from a group of assailants \"us[ing] sticks and stones to beat her.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   After reviewing this and other evidence, the immigration judge ruled that Sama was not \"eligible for the relief of asylum\" and that, because he relied on the same evidence to support his claims for withholding of removal and protection under the Convention, Sama was also not eligible for those forms of relief. Although the immigration judge ruled that Sama was credible, she found that he failed to prove past persecution. She found that Sama had not established that he had been persecuted by the Cameroonian government or that the government was \"unwilling or unable to protect him.\" She found that the police took his statement about the street assault and that \"the failure by the police to arrest [his attackers] does not indicate that the police failed to investigate.\" She found \"no indication that the police made any comment to [Sama] indicating that they would not investigate his claim, as opposed to having insufficient evidence to locate the perpetrators.\" The immigration judge also found that Sama never reported the vandalism to his mother's house and that there was no indication that the vandalism was \"officially sponsored.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The immigration judge also found that Sama failed to establish a well-founded fear of future persecution. She found that \"[w]hile the record suggests [that] the group that attacked [Sama] remains at large, there is no convincing evidence that any private citizens have continued searching for [Sama], or even if they are, that the police cannot or will not protect him as they did in the past.\" She acknowledged that a warrant for his arrest was issued in 2015, that his mother was detained for two days because she refused to tell the police where Sama was, and that Sama's friends and relatives expressed concern for him. But she found that \"no Cameroonian authorities ever stopped or arrested [Sama]\"-even though the police took his statement at the hospital after the warrant issued. Indeed, the police never \"returned [to] the hospital to search for [Sama] or seek to arrest him\" during his 15-day convalescence\n   despite the close proximity of the hospital to the \"region ... where the warrant was issued.\" In addition, the immigration judge found that the 2015 State Department report evidences that \"Cameroonian authorities are willing and able to protect [lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and intersex] persons and their allies.\" In sum, Sama \"ha[d] not shown that he has an objectively reasonable fear of persecution in Cameroon.\" So the immigration judge ruled that Sama did not qualify for asylum or any other form of relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The Board of Immigration Appeals dismissed Sama's appeal. It agreed with the immigration judge that Sama failed to prove that he had been persecuted or had a well-founded fear of \"future harm in Cameroon on account of [his] support of, or association with, homosexuals ... carried out by groups or individuals the government of Cameroon is unable or unwilling to control.\" The Board found it persuasive that the police \"came to take [Sama's] statement when called by hospital personnel\" and that the officers did not take advantage of the opportunity to arrest him. It also relied on the 2015 country report, which \"discusse[d] an incident in which police came to the aid of a member of the [lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and intersex] community.\" And it relied on the immigration judge's conclusion that, although \"homophobia is pervasive in Cameroon, incidents of arrest and extortion by [the] authorities [a]re decreasing.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Second, we explain that Sama received due process of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <em>\n    A. Substantial Evidence Supports the Decision of the Board that Sama Was Not Eligible for Asylum.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Sama argues that he is eligible for asylum because the record compels a finding that he both experienced past persecution and has a well-founded fear of future persecution. \"To establish asylum eligibility based on ... [a] protected ground, the alien must, with credible evidence, establish (1) past persecution on account of ... [a] protected ground, or (2) a 'well-founded fear' that ... [a] protected ground will cause future persecution.\"\n   <em>\n    Sepulveda\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9176708\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/401/1226/#p1230\">\n    401 F.3d at 1230-31\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20208.13\">\n    8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), (b) ).

Substantial evidence supports the findings of the Board that Sama did not experience past persecution and does not have a well-founded fear of future persecution. And because he is not eligible for asylum, he is necessarily not entitled to withholding of removal or relief under the Convention.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Zheng v. U.S. Att'y Gen.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3272350\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/451/1287/#p1292\">\n    451 F.3d 1287\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1292 (11th Cir. 2006). We address each argument in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   1. Substantial Evidence Supports the Finding that Sama Did Not Suffer Past Persecution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Sama argues that he was persecuted on account of two protected grounds. It is undisputed that Sama expressed a political opinion and is an imputed member of a protected group-namely, the gay community-because others allegedly perceive him to be gay.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Al Najjar v. U.S. Att'y Gen.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11088718,11088662\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/257/1262/\">\n    257 F.3d 1262\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1289 (11th Cir. 2001) (explaining that an imputed characteristic, \"whether correctly or incorrectly attributed, may constitute a ground for a well-founded fear of ... persecution\" (citation and internal quotation marks omitted)). But the parties dispute whether substantial evidence supports the finding that he did not experience persecution by the police.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The record does not compel a finding of past persecution by the police. \"[P]ersecution is an extreme concept\" that requires evidence of \"more than a few isolated incidents of ... harassment or intimidation.\"\n   <em>\n    Sepulveda\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9176708\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/401/1226/#p1230\">\n    401 F.3d at 1231\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). Sama never alleged that he was physically harmed by the police. Indeed, the police expressed an interest in bringing Sama's attackers to justice when they visited the hospital to take his statement about the attack. And Sama has not suggested that he was afraid to speak with the officers at the hospital. True, the police issued a warrant for his arrest because of the message he posted at his school, and they detained his mother on the basis of that warrant. But the warrant issued before he was attacked, the police did not execute the warrant when they visited him at the hospital, and the police released his mother after \"about two days\" without demanding Sama's surrender. Sama admitted that the police never questioned him about his sexuality or support for gay rights, that he has never been arrested or questioned by the Cameroonian police for any reason, and that he has never spent any time in a Cameroonian jail. These incidents do not amount to \"more than a few isolated incidents of ... harassment or intimidation.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9176708\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/401/1226/#p1230\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9176708\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/401/1226/#p1230\">\n    at 1231\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).

Substantial Evidence Supports the Finding that Sama Does Not Have a Well-Founded Fear of Future Persecution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Sama also contends that he established a well-founded fear of future persecution.

Sama argues that the police still have a warrant for his arrest, but the record does not compel a finding that he will be arrested when he returns to Cameroon. To be sure, the police attempted to execute the warrant and arrested Sama's mother shortly before he left the country. But the police did not attempt to arrest Sama when they visited him in the hospital or at any other point during his 15-day convalescence. Sama also points to statements from his friends and family that they believe he faces a continued threat of persecution by the police. For example, his cousin stated that he \"believe[s] [Sama] can't go back to Cameroon because [the cousin] ha[d] talk[ed] to friends and family members,\" who told him that the police \"[we]re still looking for [Sama.]\" And Sama's uncle similarly stated that he \"believe[d]\" the police were \"looking for\" Sama.
