Gabarette was injured in a motor vehicle accident during the course of their employment. Castillo's estate and Gabarette filed declaratory judgment actions seeking coverage under the uninsured/underinsured motorists endorsement of a third party's insurance policy for payment of the wrongful death and personal injury damages from the accident. The district court held that the policy did not extend coverage to Castillo's estate or Gabarette and granted summary judgment to the insurer. They now appeal. Because the plain language of the policy supports the district court's determination, we affirm the judgment of the district court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Purnell Furniture Services, Inc. (\"Purnell\"), a Virginia company, hired Castillo\n   and Gabarette (collectively, the \"Plaintiffs\") as independent contractors to deliver furniture in northern Virginia.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Purnell regularly hired such independent contractors to deliver its furniture in the contractors' vehicles. For this particular delivery, the originally scheduled contractors were unable to fulfill the order, and Purnell inquired whether the Plaintiffs could do the job. Due to Purnell's last-minute request, the Plaintiffs did not have a sufficient vehicle available, so Purnell permitted them to use a truck for that delivery that Purnell had rented from Penske.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Gabarette drove the truck with Castillo as passenger. En route to their destination, they pulled over on the side of the interstate so Castillo could check on the security of the furniture load. Another driver then struck the rented Penske truck, killing Castillo and injuring Gabarette.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   At the time of the accident, Purnell had a motor vehicle insurance policy (the \"Policy\") issued by Employers Insurance Co. of Wausau (\"Wausau\"), which includes an uninsured/underinsured motorists (\"UIM\")\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   endorsement as required by the applicable state law of Virginia.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Va.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2038.2-2206\">\n    Va.

These coverages are identified on the Declarations Pages as limited \"to those autos shown as covered autos.\" J.A. 68.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Covered autos are designated by a code listed next to a particular coverage on the Schedule, and the \"Motor Carrier Coverage Form\" defines each code. Under the Schedule, the Policy extends liability coverage to all autos designated by code \"61,\" which is defined as \"Any Auto\" on the Motor Carrier Coverage Form. J.A. 134. However, for UIM coverage-as opposed to liability coverage-the Schedule restricts covered autos to those designated by code \"62,\" which the Motor Carrier Coverage Form defines as \"Owned Autos Only.\" J.A. 134. The Policy lists only three vehicles on the \"Schedule of Covered Autos You Own,\" none of which are the rented Penske truck.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The Declarations Pages also reference the UIM endorsement for the limits of that particular coverage, which provides that Wausau would \"pay in accordance with the Virginia Uninsured Motorists Law, all sums the insured is legally entitled to recover as damages from the owner or operator of an uninsured motor vehicle.\" J.A. 105. For UIM purposes, an insured party is defined as \"[a]nyone ... occupying a covered auto.\" J.A. 105. The\n   UIM endorsement defines \"covered auto\" as \"a motor vehicle, or a temporary substitute, with respect to which the bodily injury or property damage liability coverage of the policy applies.\" J.A. 104.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Castillo's estate and Gabarette filed separate suits against the alleged negligent driver in the Fairfax County, Virginia, Circuit Court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because of the driver's limited insurance coverage, the Plaintiffs also brought an action in the same state court against Wausau for a declaration as to UIM coverage under the Policy and their entitlement to that coverage. Wausau removed the declaratory judgment action to the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia on the basis of diversity jurisdiction pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

First, the Court concluded that only\n   <em>\n    owned\n   </em>\n   vehicles were covered by the policy. Although specific policy provisions were not recited in the opinion, the basis for this holding is clear from the record on file with the Court. The declarations page of Whitaker's policy contained a specific section addressing vehicles included for the purpose of the UM coverage. Only \"automobiles owned by the Named Insured\" were designated for insurance coverage under the UM endorsement and, therefore, the policy did not cover a vehicle owned by Bayer.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=439%20S.E.2d%20335\">\n    439 S.E.2d at 337\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Here, as in\n   <em>\n    Bayer\n   </em>\n   , the Declarations Pages of the Policy limit the UIM coverage to only certain automobiles: code 62 autos. The Motor Carrier Coverage Form defines code 62 as \"Owned Autos Only.\" J.A. 134. Because the Penske truck is not listed in the Policy as one of the owned vehicles, there is no UIM coverage related to it under the Policy. This result is plainly required by not only the\n   <em>\n    Bayer\n   </em>\n   decision but by the clear public policy of Virginia as to UIM insurance coverage. Indeed, \"[i]n Virginia, uninsured motorist coverage is meant to protect an insured motorist, his family and permissive users of\n   <em>\n    his vehicle\n   </em>\n   against the peril of injury by an uninsured wrongdoer, not to provide insurance coverage upon each and every uninsured vehicle to everyone.\"\n   <em>\n    Bayer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=267%20S.E.2d%2091\">\n    267 S.E.2d at 93\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added).\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The thrust of the Plaintiffs' case is that the required UIM endorsement has a definition of \"covered auto\" that is broader than the UIM limitation of the Policy's Declarations Pages. However, the Supreme\n   Court of Virginia rejected a similar argument in\n   <em>\n    Bayer\n   </em>\n   .

Absent a controlling decision from the Virginia Supreme Court, this Court should follow settled state law governing the interpretation of ambiguous coverage terms in insurance contracts, which holds that the ambiguous terms should be construed in favor of coverage. Rather than applying this settled Virginia law, the majority opinion engages in complex legal gymnastics, resolving the ambiguity through interpretive principles that lack any basis in Virginia law.

Moore\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"622364\" index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va/266/155/\">\n    266 Va. 155\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"127\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=580%20S.E.2d%20823\">\n    580 S.E.2d 823\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 828 (Va. 2003) ) (emphasis added). But in\n   <em>\n    Cunningham\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court of Virginia expressly declined to address application of the canon because it found the contract at issue was not ambiguous.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12648919\" index=\"128\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/se2d/806/380/\">\n    806 S.E.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   386 n.10. Thus, the quoted language is dicta, and, more importantly, provides no support for the contention that the canon is inapplicable when the state drafts an Endorsement. Indeed, given that an insurer's status as the drafter of the contract is only a \"part\" of the rationale behind the canon,\n   <em>\n    Cunningham\n   </em>\n   implies that other reasons would still favor applying the canon, even when the insurer is not the drafter.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12648919\" index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/se2d/806/380/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   That would seem to be particularly true when, as here, a state regulator has rendered a judgment as to what language should be included in an insurance contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   The majority opinion concludes by arguing that my reasoning leads to \"absurdity\" by espousing \"a public policy choice made at no place in Virginia law\"-that an automobile insurance policy \"extend[s] UIM coverage to every vehicle to which it extended liability coverage.\"\n   <em>\n    Ante\n   </em>\n   at 632. Not so. There is no dispute that the language of the SCC's required UIM Endorsement defines \"[c]overed auto\" as \"a motor vehicle ... with respect to which the 'bodily injury' or 'property damage'\n   <em>\n    liability coverage\n   </em>\n   of the policy applies.\" J.A. 104 (emphasis added). And the SCC's requirement that insurance contracts include this form language is amenable to at least two interpretations, neither of which support the majority opinion's assertion that my position leads to \"absurdity.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   On the one hand, the Endorsement's required language could be treated as the reasoned judgment of a state regulator creating a new standard of UIM coverage, above the minimum required by statute. To be sure, the Supreme Court of Virginia has held that the\n   <em>\n    statute\n   </em>\n   does not require UIM coverage for non-owned vehicles.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Stone\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=478%20S.E.2d%20883\">\n    478 S.E.2d at 886\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But that does not necessarily mean that the SCC, as a state administrative body, cannot-and did not-use the form to create a regulatory requirement above the floor created by the statute. If that is indeed the case, the Endorsement would not lead to \"absurdity,\" but would instead represent a \"public policy choice\" made by the Commonwealth\n   of Virginia, rather than one created by this Court.\n   <em>\n    Ante\n   </em>\n   at 632.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   On the other hand, one could view the Endorsement's definition of \"[c]overed auto\" as providing a default definition from which the parties can agree to deviate through negotiated contractual provisions. To do so, however, the contract would need to include language clearly establishing that the parties intended to limit UIM coverage-language which the policy at issue here lacks and which would prevent the \"absurdity\" feared by the majority.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"131\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=478%20S.E.2d%20883\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   For example, the parties could include language in the Declarations Pages stating that, \"notwithstanding the language of the Uninsured/Underinsured Motorist Endorsement, the definition of 'covered vehicles' indicated in these Declarations controls.\" Yet, the policy at issue here makes no mention of the conflicting language in the Declarations Pages and the Endorsement, nor does it expressly provide that the coverage language in the Declarations Pages controls. Considering that the Endorsement, by its own terms, \"\n   <strong>\n    CHANGES THE POLICY\n   </strong>\n   ,\" J.A. 104, the insurance company's acquiesce to this conflict is as much evidence that the Endorsement controls as it is to the contrary. In other words, we are left without clear evidence as to how the parties in this case wanted that conflict resolved. We should therefore construe this ambiguous aspect of the contract in favor of coverage.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"132\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=677%20S.E.2d%20299\">\n    677 S.E.2d at 302\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Deciding between these two possibilities is a complex question of state law not raised by the parties in this case. As such, we are left with another level of ambiguity-not just the internal ambiguity between the documents themselves but also the ambiguity created by the competing positions of different branches of the Virginia government. The majority writes its opinion under the guise of federalism, but the majority is merely choosing to rely on language in an opinion of the Supreme Court of Virginia over language in a form promulgated by a state regulator-form language that does not even necessarily conflict with the state court opinion. That decision no doubt advances the majority opinion's policy objective. But \"[a]s a court sitting in diversity, we are bound to apply state law, not create it.\"\n   <em>\n    Ante\n   </em>\n   at 632. We should therefore not be establishing state policy, particularly when doing so potentially requires choosing between the policy preferences of two different branches of state government. Rather, we should follow undisputed state law regarding the proper approach to interpreting Virginia insurance contracts: construe ambiguous provisions in favor of coverage.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"133\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=677%20S.E.2d%20299\">\n    677 S.E.2d at 302\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   This Court should recognize the multi-layered ambiguity presented by the documents in this case and apply that canon of construction. The Plaintiffs should thus be entitled to coverage under the policy, and the district court should be reversed. Nothing presented by this case justifies the majority's efforts to create an unprecedented exception to a well-established principle of state law. For these reasons, I respectfully dissent.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"*\">\n   <p id=\"p-81\">\n    The majority opinion also relies on\n    <em>\n     Stone v.

In\n    <em>\n     Stone\n    </em>\n    , the Supreme Court of Virginia decided a question not at issue in this case-what level of uninsured motorist insurance is\n    <em>\n     required\n    </em>\n    by Virginia statute.\n    <em>\n     Stone\n    </em>\n    held that under the relevant statute, coverage is required only for owned vehicles.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"136\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=478%20S.E.2d%20883\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"136\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=478%20S.E.2d%20883\">\n     at 886\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . But\n    <em>\n     Stone\n    </em>\n    sets a floor for UIM coverage, not a ceiling. It in no way bars an insurer from contracting to provide UIM coverage for non-owned vehicles, or an insured from contracting with an insurer to obtain such coverage. The relevant question here is whether the Defendant entered into such a contract.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
