Peterson argues: (1) there was insufficient evidence to support his convictions; (2) the district court\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   erred in rejecting his theory of defense instruction; (3) the district court procedurally erred in calculating his sentence; and (4) his sentence is substantively unreasonable. We disagree and affirm Peterson's conviction and sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Peterson was a state deputy probation officer with the District 9 Probation Office in Kearney, Nebraska. From approximately October 2010 through January 2014, Peterson's caseload was comprised entirely of the highest risk offenders-offenders who are deemed most likely to re-offend based upon their criminal history, record of compliance with supervision, and alcohol and drug abuse. It was Peterson's job to supervise these offenders, including conducting home visits, monitoring compliance with terms of release, and reporting the offenders' progress to the court. A report that the offenders failed to comply with the terms of their supervision could result in the probationers having their probation revoked, sending the offenders to jail or prison.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   During the same time period, Peterson engaged in inappropriate sexual acts and inappropriate sexual contact with several of his female probationers.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Peterson would conduct home visits alone, despite the Probation Office's policy to send two officers, and would engage in inappropriate sexual behavior during those visits. He also engaged in sexual conduct with probationers in his office during their probation meetings. Peterson would warn the probationers when random drug tests were going to be conducted and when other probation officers were going to perform unannounced home visits, using this information to pressure his probationers into repaying him with sexual favors. Peterson further coerced his probationers by frequently commenting on the power he had over them and his ability to put offenders in jail. At trial, the probationers all testified that they feared standing up to Peterson or rejecting his advances because of the authority that he had over them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On July 29, 2016, a jury convicted Peterson of four counts of Deprivation of Civil Rights under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20242\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 242\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and one count of making False Statements to a Government Agent under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201001\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Prior to submitting the case to the\n   jury, Peterson requested a theory of defense jury instruction, which the district court denied. Following his conviction, the district court varied upward from the otherwise applicable Sentencing Guideline range and sentenced Peterson to 108 months imprisonment. Peterson appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Peterson first makes a blanket argument that there was insufficient evidence to support his convictions for any of the four counts of depriving his female probationers of their civil rights. \"We review challenges to the sufficiency of the evidence de novo.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Spight\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6813794\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/817/1099/#p1102\">\n    817 F.3d 1099\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1102 (8th Cir. 2016) (internal quotation marks omitted).

We also do \"not pass upon the credibility of witnesses or the weight to be given their testimony because [c]redibility determinations are uniquely within the province of the trier of fact, and are entitled to special deference.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6813794\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/817/1099/#p1102\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (alteration in original) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \" Section 242 is a ... civil rights statute making it criminal to act (1) 'willfully' and (2) under color of law (3) to deprive a person of rights protected by the Constitution or laws of the United States.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Lanier\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11651497\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/520/259/#p264\">\n    520 U.S. 259\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 264,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11651497\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/520/259/#p264\">\n    117 S.Ct. 1219\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11651497\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/520/259/#p264\">\n    137 L.Ed.2d 432\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1997). An action is under color of law if the defendant misused power that he \"possessed by virtue of state law and [the action was] made possible only because the wrongdoer [was] clothed with the authority of state law.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

And, in\n   <em>\n    Hawkins v. Holloway\n   </em>\n   , we held that a sheriff's \"repeated intentional touching of [the victim's] breasts\" was sufficient to find that he deprived the victim of her constitutional rights.\n   <em>\n    Hawkins\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9378898\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/316/777/#p785\">\n    316 F.3d 777\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 785 (8th Cir. 2003).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Here, there is no question that Peterson's conduct was willful, as he does not deny that he intentionally engaged in sexual conduct with the victims; thus, the first element is satisfied. However, Peterson does argue that the evidence is insufficient to show that the victims acquiesced to his sexual advances as a result of his abuse of his state law authority. Contrary to Peterson's contention, the record is replete with evidence that he was acting under color of law, including testimony from the probationers involved that the sexual encounters occurred in his office and on home visits while Peterson was on duty and acting in the capacity of a probation officer. Furthermore, all of the probationers testified that they acquiesced because Peterson had the power to cause them to be jailed and threatened them with that power. Thus, we find that the second element is satisfied.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Spight\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6813794\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/817/1099/#p1102\">\n    817 F.3d at 1102\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (stating that we do not pass on the credibility of witnesses or the weight given to their testimony);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Johnson v.

Because the record provides ample evidence that Peterson engaged in conduct that deprived his victims of their civil rights, we find that the third element is met. Therefore, we hold that there was sufficient evidence for the district court to find that Peterson committed four counts of depriving his probationer victims of their civil rights under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20242\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 242\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Second, Peterson argues that the district court erred in rejecting his theory of defense instruction. A criminal defendant is \"entitled to a theory of defense instruction if it is timely requested, is supported by the evidence, and is a correct statement of the law.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Chatmon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4072945\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/742/350/#p354\">\n    742 F.3d 350\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 354 (8th Cir. 2014) (internal quotation marks omitted). \"We review a district court's rejection of defendant's proposed instruction for abuse of discretion ....\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4072945\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/742/350/#p354\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Peterson argues that the jury should have been instructed that, in order to be convicted of depriving his probationers of their civil rights, he must have known both that he used his position of power to cause the victims to submit to his demands and that the victims consented because of that influence. We are unable to find any authority supporting Peterson's instruction as a correct statement of the law, and Peterson does not cite any authority in support of his argument.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Giordano\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1063947\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/442/30/#p45\">\n    442 F.3d at 46-47\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (rejecting the defendant's defense that the victims' fear \"that he could use his power as mayor to harm them and their families cannot be relevant to whether he acted 'under color of law' \" because the defendant \"actively and deliberately used his apparent authority as mayor to ensure that the victims did not resist or report the ongoing abuse\"). Therefore, we find that the district court did not abuse its discretion in rejecting Peterson's proposed defense instruction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Alvarez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12265489\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/878/640/#p641\">\n    878 F.3d 640\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 641 (8th Cir. 2017) (per curiam) (concluding that the defendant's argument was without merit when, in part, he failed to cite authority supporting his contention);\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Assuming without deciding that the district court erred in calculating Peterson's Sentencing Guidelines range, we hold that the error was harmless. When the district court explicitly states that it would have imposed the same sentence of imprisonment regardless of the underlying Sentencing Guideline range, \"any error on the part of the district court is harmless.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Davis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5757035\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/583/1081/#p1094\">\n    583 F.3d 1081\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1094-95 (8th Cir. 2009) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Here, the district court specifically stated at the sentencing hearing that it would have imposed the same sentence regardless of the Sentencing Guidelines calculations. Therefore, we find that any procedural error on the part of the district court in calculating Peterson's sentence was harmless.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12124967\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/846/277/#p280\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Fourth, Peterson argues that his sentence was substantively unreasonable. \"When we review a defendant's sentence to determine whether it is unreasonable with regard to the application of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203553\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), we apply a [deferential] abuse-of-discretion standard.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The court also stated that it imposed the sentence to reflect the seriousness of Peterson preying on these vulnerable women, \"to promote respect for the law, to provide for just punishment, to afford both specific and general deterrence,\" and to protect the public against Peterson.
