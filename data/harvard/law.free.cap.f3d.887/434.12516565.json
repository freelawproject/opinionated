Reid pled guilty to possessing heroin with intent to distribute, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20841\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1), and being a felon in possession of a firearm, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20922\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g)(1), 924(a)(2). The district court\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   increased his offense level based on two prior Missouri convictions under section 195.211, RSMo 2002: (1) attempted possession of a controlled substance with the intent to deliver not more than five grams of marijuana, and (2) delivery of not more than five grams of marijuana. Reid requested a variance to a sentence of 51 to 63 months. The district court disagreed, sentencing him to the bottom of the Guidelines range-151 months' imprisonment. Reid appeals, arguing his convictions are not for controlled substance offenses, and that the sentence is substantively unreasonable. Having jurisdiction under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201291\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , this court affirms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Reid argues that based on Missouri case law, his two convictions do not meet the Guidelines definition of controlled substance offense and thus cannot increase his offense level. As stated in this court's decision in\n   <em>\n    United States v. Thomas\n   </em>\n   , No. 17-2213,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516397\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/886/1274/\">\n    886 F.3d 1274\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%201719733\">\n    2018 WL 1719733\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (8th Cir.

This court reviews them for plain error.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     United States v.

If these conditions are met, \"the court of appeals has the\n   <em>\n    discretion\n   </em>\n   to remedy the error-discretion which ought to be exercised only if the error 'seriously affect[s] the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.' \"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Puckett v.

Missouri requires, for a conviction under section 195.211, that a defendant \"knew\" that the substance he attempted to sell was a controlled substance and did an act more than \"the mere utterance of the offer for sale.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     State v.

The district court discussed Reid's personal history. Replying to defense counsel's description of Reid's childhood as horrific and abusive, the district court agreed that he \"did have some bad things\" happen to him. The court emphasized the \"serious nature\" of the offense, noting he was \"a convicted felon, possessing 22.597 grams of heroin ... and possessing a semi-automatic firearm loaded with eight rounds of ammunition.\" The court stressed that the offense occurred while Reid was on probation, and that his criminal history was significant, including \"drug-related weapon possessions, burglary, tampering and resisting arrest convictions.\" After acknowledging the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, the court imposed a sentence that \"would address the sentencing objectives of just punishment, general deterrence and incapacitation.\" The district court did not abuse its discretion in sentencing Reid.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   * * * * * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The judgment is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-29\">\n    The Honorable Ronnie L.
