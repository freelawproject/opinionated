Phillips, a Professional Law Corporation (collectively, \"Phillips\") appeals the bankruptcy court's determination that debtor-appellee Kevin Gilman (\"Gilman\") was entitled to a homestead exemption of $100,000. Because the bankruptcy court did not determine whether Gilman had the requisite intent to continue to reside in the property in question, we vacate and remand for further fact finding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Gilman filed a voluntary petition for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Central District of California. Gilman listed Phillips and Tammy R. Phillips, a Professional Law Corporation, as creditors.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   On Gilman's initial Schedule A (Real Property), he listed two pieces of property: (1) 6553 Varna Ave., Van Nuys, California, and (2) 9010 Corbin Ave., Suite 16, Northridge, California. He described the second property as \"in escrow.\" On Gilman's initial Schedule C (property claimed as exempt), he claimed a household exemption for the Varna Avenue property. Under the column, \"Specify Law Providing Each Exemption,\" Gilman cited California Code of Civil Procedure \u00a7 704.730 and stated \"Debtor has Cancer and has not been able to work in his business.\" On Gilman's Schedule G (Executory Contracts and Unexpired Leases), he did not list any contracts relating to the sale of the Varna Avenue property.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Gilman would later admit in an interrogatory that escrow was open on this property on the day he filed for bankruptcy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Phillips filed an adversary proceeding against Gilman alleging that Gilman's debts to Phillips were non-dischargeable because of various fraudulent actions.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Phillips also objected to Gilman's homestead exemption. Gilman did not oppose the objection and did not appear at the hearing. Therefore, the bankruptcy court sustained Phillips' objections.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Shortly thereafter, Gilman filed an amended Schedule C, claiming a reduced exemption on a reduced property value. Like the initial Schedule C, the amended schedule continued to seek an exemption under \u00a7 704.730 and stated \"Debtor has Cancer and has not been able to work in his business.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Having already prevailed on the exemption issue, Phillips objected to the amended exemptions. Gilman then moved for relief from the bankruptcy court's order, arguing that his counsel's mistaken failure to oppose Phillips' objections constituted excusable neglect and warranted relief under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b)(1). Following a hearing, the bankruptcy court granted Gilman's request for relief (\"the Rule 60(b) Order\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Phillips renewed the objection to the amended exemption, which the bankruptcy court denied, except for agreeing to hold an evidentiary hearing on Gilman's entitlement to an enhanced homestead exemption based on disability. Phillips moved for reconsideration, pointing out newly discovered evidence that the Varna Avenue property was in escrow at the time of filing, and arguing Gilman was thus not entitled to a homestead exemption. The bankruptcy court denied the motion, concluding that escrow did not eliminate Gilman's right to\n   a homestead exemption (the \"Homestead Exemption Order\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Phillips then appealed the Homestead Exemption Order to the district court. Phillips also purported to appeal all \"associated and fairly incorporated interlocutory orders,\" including the Rule 60(b) Order. The district court eventually affirmed the bankruptcy court on all orders, and Phillips appeals to this court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

The bankruptcy court relied on Gilman's undisputed occupancy of the premises. The bankruptcy court further held that \"the fact that [Gilman] was in escrow on a voluntary sale does not mean that he doesn't have his Article 4 automatic homestead exemption because he filed a bankruptcy case and the trustee basically could have taken control of that property and forced a sale of the property....\" The court further noted that, \"[p]ending the potential close of escrow he retained legal title to his residence and movants do not contend that Mr. Gilman did not occupy the residence at the time he filed his Chapter 7 petition....\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The district court affirmed this conclusion, holding that the bankruptcy court \"properly considered the relevant factors\" because \"the record is replete with evidence that Debtor was a continuous resident of the property in question.\" The district court, like the bankruptcy court, relied primarily on the undisputed fact that Gilman lived at the residence when he filed his petition. It also relied on Gilman's statement in an interrogatory that \"[e]scrow was open.
