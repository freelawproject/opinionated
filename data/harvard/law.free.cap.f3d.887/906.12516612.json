The Corps circulated the Draft EIS/EIR in May 2009 for public comment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   After receiving and considering public comments on the Draft EIS/EIR, the Corps prepared a Final EIS/EIR, which included the Corps's Draft Section 404(b)(1) Guidelines Evaluation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   As part of its analysis of the Project's water quality, biological resources, and cumulative impacts, the Final EIS/EIR discussed the Project's water discharges into the Santa Clara River and the potential impacts on the Southern California steelhead, an endangered species. The Corps determined that the Project area was not part of the steelhead's critical habitat, but considered the Project's potential to affect steelhead and its habitat downstream of the Project area through increased stormwater discharges. While the Santa Clara River generally contains water on a year-round basis, a portion of the river between the Project area and the downstream steelhead areas is dry most of the year, so Project discharges would generally not impact steelhead. (This dry reach of the river is informally known as the \"Dry Gap.\") In months when there is sufficient rainfall, however, stormwater runoff may flow through the Dry Gap, and during those periods Project discharge might reach steelhead populations. The Corps nonetheless determined that these changes would not have a substantial adverse effect on the southern steelhead.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   In reaching this conclusion, the Corps analyzed the combination of wastewater and stormwater discharges from the Project, and concluded that the Project's total discharges would have a dissolved-copper concentration of 9.0 micrograms-per-liter. This concentration is less than the existing dissolved-copper concentration in the Santa Clara River that occurs during storm events large enough to flow through the Dry Gap. In addition, this concentration would be less than the limit of 32 micrograms-per-liter of dissolved copper that the California Toxics Rule (CTR), an EPA-promulgated regulation establishing water quality standards in California, set for the Santa Clara River.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, the Corps concluded in the Final EIS/EIR that the Project would not affect the steelhead, and therefore it was not required to consult with NMFS to discharge its responsibilities under the ESA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=16%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201536\">\n    16 U.S.C. \u00a7 1536\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(3) ;\n   <extracted-citation index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20325.2\">\n    33 C.F.R. \u00a7 325.2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The Corps solicited additional comments that would be considered \"before the Corps ... finalizes the Record of Decision (ROD) for the Federal action associated with the proposed project.\" Among other letters, it received a comment letter from Ventura Coastkeeper expressing its concern that the Project's discharges would contain dissolved copper at a concentration that would harm Southern California steelhead. In August 2010, the Corps also received a letter from the EPA, offering comments on the Final EIS/EIR and suggesting, among other things, that the Corps's practicability analysis for different alternatives should consider the expected revenues from the Project. The EPA subsequently sent a letter in August 2011, indicating that it would not seek review of the Corps's permit decision, citing significant improvements to the Project design and additional mitigation measures that\n   had resulted from collaboration among the EPA, the Corps, and Newhall Land.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   On August 31, 2011, the Corps issued a ROD and a provisional Section 404(b) permit to Newhall Land. The ROD addressed the comments the Corps had received on the Final EIS/EIR. In responding to Ventura Coastkeeper's comment letter, the Corps summarized the results of a Supplemental Water Quality Analysis conducted by a third-party consultant in May 2011, which showed that the additional stormwater retention measures incorporated into the Project would further reduce the dissolved-copper concentration in the Project's stormwater discharges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The Corps also appended its Final Section 404(b)(1) Guidelines Evaluation (Final Evaluation) to the ROD. The Final Evaluation stated that it was not a stand-alone document, but relied heavily on the information provided in the Draft EIS/EIR and the Final EIS/EIR. Like the Final EIS/EIR, the Final Evaluation concluded that the Project would not affect the steelhead and therefore consultation with NMFS pursuant to the ESA was not required.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The Final Evaluation defined the \"overall project purpose\" for purposes of analyzing the practicability of alternatives as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   [T]he development of a master planned community with interrelated villages in the vicinity of the Santa Clarita Valley in northwestern Los Angeles County that achieves the basic objectives of the Specific Plan by providing a broad range of land uses of approximately the same size and proportions as approved in the Specific Plan, including residential, mixed-use, commercial and industrial uses, public services (schools, parks, etc.), and a water reclamation plant.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The Corps determined that the overall project purpose also included 15 of the 37 basic objectives of the Specific Plan. The Corps stated that the \"basic project purpose,\" which is used to determine whether the project is water dependent, was \"to provide housing and commercial/industrial/mixed-use development.\" Because the basic project purpose was not water dependent, the Corps determined that the rebuttable presumption that practicable alternatives were available applied, but was rebutted because the Corps had analyzed 23 alternative sites and concluded that they were impracticable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The Final Evaluation considered the eight on-site alternatives described and analyzed in the Final EIS/EIR, in order to determine which one was the \"least environmentally damaging practicable alternative.\"\n   <em>\n    Bering Strait Citizens\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3822304\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/524/938/#p955\">\n    524 F.3d at 955\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . These alternatives included a no-build alternative (Alternative 1), Newhall Land's preferred alternative (Alternative 2), and six other alternatives (Alternatives 3 through 7 and Modified Alternative 3), each with varying project sizes and resulting impacts on waters of the United States. Alternative 2, Newhall Land's alternative, proposed developing 2,864.2 acres, which would include 20,885 residential units\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   and 5.5 million square feet of commercial space. It would have permanently filled 93.3 acres of waters of the United States, including 20.5 acres of wetlands, and would have temporarily filled 33.3 acres of waters of the United States, including 11.2 acres of wetlands.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The Corps selected Modified Alternative 3 as the least environmentally damaging practicable alternative. Compared to Newhall Land's preferred alternative (Alternative 2), Modified Alternative 3 reduced permanent impacts to waters of the United States by 29 percent and temporary impacts by 3 percent. It also reduced the acreage that could be developed for residential units by 10 percent and likewise reduced the developable commercial acreage by 14 percent, increasing the Project's cost per developable acre by 5.7 percent. The Corps concluded that further modifications to the Project would be impracticably expensive, noting that Modified Alternative 3 would be more costly than the most expensive comparable development project in the region. Accordingly, the ROD adopted Modified Alternative 3 as the basis for the Section 404 permit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   In March 2014, SCOPE sued the EPA, the Corps, and their respective agency officials in district court, alleging violations of the CWA, NEPA, and the NHPA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Newhall Land successfully moved to intervene as a defendant. In January 2015, SCOPE amended its complaint to assert an additional claim under the ESA. On cross-motions for summary judgment, the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the Corps and Newhall Land on June 30, 2015, the judgment that SCOPE now appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   III\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Before reaching the merits of SCOPE's claims, we consider whether the plaintiffs have standing to bring their NEPA and ESA claims. After this case was argued on appeal, the Corps and Newhall Land settled with four of the six plaintiffs, and stipulated to voluntary dismissal of those plaintiffs. In supplemental briefing on the effect of these dismissals, the Corps and Newhall Land argue that while both of the remaining plaintiffs, SCOPE and Friends, have standing to pursue their CWA claim, they lack standing to pursue their NEPA and ESA claims. We may consider the jurisdictional question of Article III standing for the first time on appeal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wash. Envtl. Council v.

The Corps's determination was reasonably based on its findings that Modified Alternative 3 would be more expensive than any previous comparable development project in southern California, and would also exceed the average and median costs for such projects by at least 56 percent. The alternative was 5.7 percent more costly than Newhall Land's preferred alternative, and significantly shrank the Project's footprint.

SCOPE argues that the Project may affect steelhead because, during storm events where the volume of the Project's discharges is sufficient to flow into the reach of the Santa Clara River downstream of the Dry Gap, those discharges will contain concentrations of dissolved copper that cause sublethal impacts to juvenile steelhead smolt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   We disagree. The data and analysis set forth in the Draft EIS/EIR and Final EIS/EIR consistently establish that concentrations of dissolved copper in discharges from the Project would be within the background range already observed in the Santa Clara River and well below the CTR's dissolved-copper criterion for the Santa\n   Clara River. During storm events large enough to cause discharges from the Project to flow into the reach of the Santa Clara River downstream of the Dry Gap, the background concentration of dissolved copper in the relevant portion of the Santa Clara River averages 9.9 micrograms-per-liter. The Final EIS/EIR estimated that the combined discharge from the Project's stormwater runoff and its wastewater treatment plant would contain only 9.0 micrograms of dissolved copper per liter, which would be lower than that background concentration.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   The 2011 Supplemental Water Quality Analysis (incorporated by reference into the ROD) found that the additional stormwater retention measures required by the Corps would reduce the dissolved-copper concentration of the Project's stormwater discharges from the 8.3 micrograms-per-liter referenced in the Final EIS, to 6.5 micrograms-per-liter, again well below background. Given this information, the Corps reasonably concluded that the Project's discharges of dissolved copper would not affect steelhead downstream of Dry Gap. The Corps also noted that because the Project discharges would flow into the Santa Clara River downstream of the Dry Gap only when water flows were already high, the Project discharges would constitute less than one percent of the River's flow and \"water quality in the Santa Clara River would not be significantly affected by the discharges.\" Because the Corps's determination that the Project would not affect steelhead was not arbitrary or capricious, we reject SCOPE's ESA claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kraayenbrink\n   </em>\n   , 632 F.3d at 481.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   SCOPE's argument to the contrary hinges on its contention that the Corps erred by failing to consider a 2007 Technical Memorandum published by NMFS,\n   <em>\n    An Overview of Sensory Effects on Juvenile Salmonids Exposed to Dissolved Copper\n   </em>\n   (the \"NMFS Memorandum\") which Ventura Coastkeeper submitted with its comments on the Final EIS/EIR.

The Corps could thus reasonably consider the CTR as part of its analysis. Moreover, because the Corps considered other sources of data, including project-specific modeling, in determining that issuance of the Section 404 Permit would have no effect on downstream steelhead, SCOPE's arguments regarding limitations in the applicability of the CTR are not material.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   SCOPE next argues that because the Corps published its determination that the Project would not affect steelhead in its June 2010 Final EIS/EIR, it could not rely on the Supplemental Analysis, which had been issued almost a year later in May 2011, to support its determination. We reject this argument, because the Corps did not need to rely on the Supplemental Analysis in order to reach its conclusion. The Final EIS/EIR explains the Corps's determination that the Project's stormwater and wastewater discharges would not affect steelhead because the dissolved-copper concentrations of the combined discharge would be within background ranges and lower than the average concentration during large storm events, as well as substantially below the CTR's threshold. This conclusion was not arbitrary or capricious. The Supplemental Analysis merely confirmed the Corps's initial conclusion that there would be no effect because it established that the Project's\n   stormwater retention measures would further lower the dissolved-copper concentrations in the Project's runoff. Because the Final EIS/EIR's analysis of combined stormwater and wastewater discharges was sufficient to support the Corps's determination that Southern California steelhead would not be affected by the Project, we also reject SCOPE's argument that the Corps erred by relying on the Supplemental Analysis, which did not include the effects of wastewater discharges.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   We therefore conclude that the Corps reasonably determined that the Project would have no effect on steelhead, and in the absence of a consultation request from NMFS,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"169\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=50%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20402.14\">\n    50 C.F.R. \u00a7 402.14\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), the Corps's decision not to consult with NMFS was not arbitrary and capricious.\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   C\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   In its NEPA claim, SCOPE argues that the Corps's Final EIS/EIR provided an inadequate analysis of the cumulative impacts of the Project's dissolved-copper discharges on steelhead in the reach of the Santa Clara River downstream of the Dry Gap.
