She later asked the district court judge to recuse himself from the case under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20144\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 144\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . On March 2, 2018, the district court entered an order denying Mischler's motion for recusal. On March 7, 2018, Mischler appealed the order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This court lacks jurisdiction over the appeal. The district court has not entered a final appealable order terminating all of the issues presented in the litigation. And an order denying recusal is not immediately appealable under the collateral order doctrine.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co. v. Risjord\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11716141\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/449/368/#p373\">\n    449 U.S. 368\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 373-75,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11716141\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/449/368/#p373\">\n    101 S.Ct. 669\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11716141\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/449/368/#p373\">\n    66 L.Ed.2d 571\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1981).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   We pause to note a possible exception-and to explain why it does not apply. We have previously said that a non-final order denying recusal\n   <em>\n    may\n   </em>\n   be reviewed in a mandamus proceeding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    In re Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1244972\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/919/1136/#p1143\">\n    919 F.2d 1136\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1143 (6th Cir. 1990) (en banc). But we have not said when that is the case. Today we make clear that, consistent with Supreme Court precedent, the exception applies only when a petitioner alleges that delay will cause irreparable harm.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Firestone Tire\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11716141\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/449/368/#p373\">\n    449 U.S. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   378 n.13,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11716141\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/449/368/#p373\">\n    101 S.Ct. 669\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Otherwise, a party could always circumvent the final judgment rule by petitioning for a writ of mandamus.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Roche v. Evaporated Milk Ass'n\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"366599\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/319/21/#p27\">\n    319 U.S. 21\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 27-31,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"366599\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/319/21/#p27\">\n    63 S.Ct. 938\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"366599\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/319/21/#p27\">\n    87 L.Ed. 1185\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1943) ; 16 Charles Alan Wright &amp; Arthur R. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 3932.1 (3d ed. 2017).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Where does that leave Mischler? She insists that the judge \"should have recused\" himself \"because his paramour\" is an employee of one of the defendants. R. 56 at 2. But she makes no argument \"that the harm [she] might suffer if forced to await the final outcome ... is any greater than the harm suffered by any litigant forced to wait.\"\n   <em>\n    Firestone Tire\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11716141\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/449/368/#p373\">\n    449 U.S. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   378 n.13,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11716141\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/449/368/#p373\">\n    101 S.Ct. 669\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We therefore decline to treat the appeal as a petition for a writ of mandamus.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Accordingly, the appeal is\n   <strong>\n    DISMISSED\n   </strong>\n   for lack of jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
