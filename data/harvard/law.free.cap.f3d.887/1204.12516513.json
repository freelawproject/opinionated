Prisoners interested in receiving financial support, religious materials, and other assistance items completed applications that required them to provide personal identifying information. Shabazz and his associates then used that information to submit fraudulent tax returns and collect fraudulent tax refunds. This appeal requires us to decide several questions about Shabazz's convictions and sentence for conspiracy, wire fraud, aggravated identity theft, and theft of government funds: (1) whether the district court clearly erred when it admitted evidence seized from Shabazz's clothing during the execution of a search warrant as well as Shabazz's post-arrest statements; (2) whether the district court abused its discretion when it admitted evidence of uncharged conduct and photographs of Shabazz and his wife with large sums of money; (3) whether the district court violated Shabazz's right not to wear jail clothes after he waived his right to appear in street clothes; (4) whether the district court erred when it instructed the jury about conspirator liability under\n   <em>\n    Pinkerton v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"377314\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/328/640/\">\n    328 U.S. 640\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"377314\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/328/640/\">\n    66 S.Ct. 1180\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"377314\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/328/640/\">\n    90 L.Ed. 1489\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1946) ; (5) whether sufficient evidence supports Shabazz's convictions for conspiracy and aggravated identity theft; and (6) whether the district court erred when it calculated Shabazz's Sentencing Guidelines range or imposed a substantively unreasonable sentence. We affirm Shabazz's convictions and sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   From 2009 to 2012, Qadir Shabazz used Indigent Inmate, a \"charity\" he founded and financed, to defraud prisoners throughout the country. According to the \"Member Handbook,\" the nonprofit served \"to aid and assist those who are incarcerated\" by \"provid[ing] inspirational literature, news paper [sic] subscriptions and financial assistance to those in need.\" But the evidence at trial established that the nonprofit instead served to enrich Shabazz and his associates at the expense of inmates seeking assistance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Employees of Indigent Inmate mailed prisoners applications that requested their personal identifying information, including their social security numbers and dates of birth. One employee of Indigent Inmate testified that she marked applications \"disqualified\" if they indicated that applicants had student loans, owed child support, or listed an incorrect Social Security number or booking number. Members of the conspiracy then used the personal identifying information to file fraudulent income tax returns seeking tax refunds. And they formed corporations in the names of applicants to allow the conspirators to access the funds. For example, Shabazz or one of his coconspirators created a corporation in the name of William Malone, Inc., created a William Malone, Inc., account, deposited a fraudulently obtained refund check issued to William Malone, an Indigent Inmate applicant, into that account, and wrote a check drawn on that account to Shabazz. Investigators also found a debit card for the account in Shabazz's wallet. Similarly, a corporation was created in the name of another Indigent Inmate applicant, Sandra Oyawusi, and investigators found a debit card for that account in another one of Shabazz's wallets.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Shabazz professed to have four wives-at least two of whom helped him with the day-to-day operations-but Shabazz was in charge of Indigent Inmate. For example, forms filed with the Georgia Secretary of State listed Leslie Scott-also known as Leslie Shabazz-as the CEO and registered agent of the company. And Sheena Shabazz directly managed some, if not all, of the employees. But Qadir Shabazz rented\n   the office space, hired employees, paid the employees, and held himself out as the president.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The investigation of the scheme began in Pennsylvania. Agents from the Pennsylvania Attorney General's Office and Pennsylvania Bureau of Revenue began investigating fraudulent state tax returns that listed 2615 Brownsville Road, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, as the taxpayer address. The agents discovered that one of Shabazz's associates, Dion McBride, was involved in a prisoner tax-fraud scheme, and McBride later informed the agents that Shabazz was responsible for that scheme.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   After further investigation, the agents obtained search warrants for a residence at 2864 Cheney Street, East Point, Georgia and the Indigent Inmate headquarters at 1677 Dorsey Avenue, East Point, Georgia. To establish probable cause, the search-warrant affidavit detailed evidence of the involvement of Shabazz and his wives. That evidence included not only McBride's statements, but also bank records, phone records, and surveillance records.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Shabazz and Leslie Shabazz were present at the Cheney Street address when the agents arrived to execute the warrant. Because Shabazz was wearing only boxer shorts and a T-shirt, an agent located a pair of pants at Shabazz's direction, confirmed with Shabazz that the pants were his, and emptied the pockets. The agent then discovered and seized a number of credit cards and identification cards that were in a wallet in one of the pockets. One of those cards was the debit card for the William Malone, Inc., bank account.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The agents also executed the search warrant for the Indigent Inmate headquarters at the Dorsey Avenue address. They seized 12 boxes of completed Indigent Inmate applications and approximately 20 computers on which investigators discovered over 90 fraudulent tax returns. Pennsylvania agents created a spreadsheet with the information obtained from the completed applications and sent the spreadsheet to the Internal Revenue Service. An investigative analyst recorded the information in an electronic master file of tax-return filings and noticed that 15 mailing addresses were repeatedly listed on the returns. She then created a summary spreadsheet that showed the number of returns filed and the refund amount requested for the 15 addresses. More than 2,000 tax returns included prisoner information from the Indigent Inmate files and listed one of the 15 common addresses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The evidence established a number of connections between Shabazz and the fraudulent returns. He was directly or indirectly connected to 11 of the 15 addresses. For example, Shabazz leased four of the addresses: 2945 Orr Drive, 1677 Dorsey Avenue, 1782 Neely Avenue, and 1447 Walker Avenue. And like many of the fraudulent returns introduced at trial, Shabazz's 2009 tax return claimed large car and truck expenses and falsely listed Revco Discount Drug Centers, Inc., as his employer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Pennsylvania agents arrested Shabazz and interviewed him twice. Shabazz maintains that he never received a warning and never waived his rights under\n   <em>\n    Miranda v. Arizona\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12046400\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/384/436/\">\n    384 U.S. 436\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12046400\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/384/436/\">\n    86 S.Ct. 1602\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12046400\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/384/436/\">\n    16 L.Ed.2d 694\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1966). But the agents testified that they provided Shabazz with a\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warning, though they could not produce a signed waiver form or recording to corroborate their account. According to one of the agents, Shabazz told them during the interviews that he \"ran an operation or a company known as Indigent Inmate[ ],\" that \"Dion McBride was making him out to be the mastermind of the [tax-fraud] operation, but he wasn't,\" and that\n   \"there were other people involved in the Pittsburgh area.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Before trial, Shabazz moved to suppress his post-arrest statements on the ground that the agents failed to provide a\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warning. The magistrate judge credited the contrary testimony of the agents, and the district court adopted the magistrate judge's report and recommendation. The district court explained that the two agents \"offered consistent, detailed testimony of the events ..., giving similar accounts of the interviews.\" In contrast, Shabazz \"could not recall how [one] interview concluded and could not even recall meeting with the agents twice.\" It also explained that \"Shabazz ha[d] a prior conviction for fraud, which further call[ed] into question his credibility.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Shabazz moved to suppress the contents of his wallet on the ground that the search-warrant affidavit for the Dorsey and Cheney Street addresses did not establish probable cause. The magistrate judge concluded that the affidavit was not deficient, and the district court again adopted the magistrate judge's report and recommendation. It explained that Shabazz's argument that the warrants were \"based solely upon [statements by] persons with an interest in the case as defendants, e.g. Dion McBride\" was unpersuasive because \"[t]he affidavit[ ] also refer[red] to evidence gathered from other sources such as transaction records, phone records, websites[,] and surveillance.\" And the affidavit \"recite[d] steps that investigators took to corroborate McBride's statements, including contacting a hotel where Shabazz stayed in 2010 and 2011.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Shabazz also unsuccessfully opposed a pretrial motion by the government to admit fraudulent tax returns that were not alleged in the indictment. The district court ruled that the evidence was admissible under\n   <em>\n    United States v. Ford\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4180555\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/784/1386/\">\n    784 F.3d 1386\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (11th Cir. 2015). In\n   <em>\n    Ford\n   </em>\n   , we affirmed the admission of evidence of uncharged conduct intrinsic to a tax-fraud scheme.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4180555\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/784/1386/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4180555\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/784/1386/\">\n    at 1394\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   At trial, the government introduced evidence of Shabazz's involvement in the scheme. It called several victims, and it introduced fraudulent tax returns that were both charged and not charged in the indictment. And the district court admitted, over objection, a set of photographs of Shabazz and Leslie Shabazz with large amounts of cash. After the government explained that the pictures were \"relevant to the issue of whether or not [Shabazz] had, in fact, received illicit proceeds,\" the district court ruled that \"they [were] relevant\" and \"d[id] tend to prove a fact in dispute.\" Shabazz also testified and denied any involvement in the fraudulent scheme.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On the second day of trial, Shabazz objected to wearing his prison clothes. He entered the courtroom in his prison jumpsuit and explained to the district court that he was wearing the jumpsuit because the marshals had not allowed him to take his legal work with him at the end of the previous day of trial. He stated, \"I can't take my legal work with me, because I am in jail. So why I come in here and front like I'm not[?]\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The district court explained to him that it was \"[his] choice\" \"to wear those clothes,\" but it reminded him that he did not \"have to wear them\" and warned him that \"it [wa]s a dangerous and mistaken notion to wear them because ... it sends the wrong signal to the jury.\" It stated, \"There is a reason that criminal defendants are not required to wear prison garb during trials, and it is because, for some people, that will create a presumption of guilt.\" It also stressed that it did not \"mind taking the time for [Shabazz] to put [his] suit on.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Shabazz declined the opportunity to change his clothes. The district court then stated, \"Mr. Shabazz has elected to remain in his orange jumpsuit[,] which is his right, but I am going to instruct the jury when they come in that they should not infer anything regarding guilt or innocence because of his wearing [it].\" Shabazz's counsel did not object.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Shabazz's counsel expressed concern about the clothing only\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   the jury entered the room. At a sidebar conference, counsel told the district court, \"Well, as the jury walked out, [Shabazz] said he want[ed] to put the suit on.\" The district court refused to allow Shabazz to change. It explained that \"the jury ha[d] already seen him in the orange jumpsuit, and he ... waived his right when he said no, and [the district court] called the jury back in. He c[ould]n't recall the jury after the jury c[a]me[ ] in and [change his] mind....\" It then gave a limiting instruction as promised.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   At the end of the trial, the district court instructed the jury, over Shabazz's objection, about the rule of conspirator liability established in\n   <em>\n    Pinkerton v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"377314\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/328/640/\">\n    328 U.S. 640\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"377314\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/328/640/\">\n    66 S.Ct. 1180\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"377314\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/328/640/\">\n    90 L.Ed. 1489\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1946). And the jury convicted Shabazz of all counts: one count of conspiracy to defraud the government, 15 counts of wire fraud, 15 counts of aggravated identity theft, and two counts of theft of government funds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   At sentencing, the district court heard arguments about issues related to the calculation of Shabazz's Sentencing Guidelines range. It rejected Shabazz's argument that he did not qualify for a role enhancement because he did not exercise control over other members of the conspiracy. It stated that it could not \"say that he did not exercise control over them\" and that it \"th[ought] he d[id] satisfy the enhancement's definition or description of one as an organizer or leader of criminal activity.\" It also ruled that the government had \"proved at trial sufficiently, beyond a preponderance of the evidence,\" that it was appropriate to calculate the intended loss amount by considering tax returns that were filed in the names of Indigent Inmate applicants and listed one of the fifteen common addresses-regardless of whether the evidence established that Shabazz was directly or indirectly connected to the addresses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The district court sentenced Shabazz to 277 months of imprisonment, five years of supervised release, a special assessment of $3,300, and restitution totaling $1,680,299. The sentence was below Shabazz's Sentencing Guidelines range, which was 292 to 365 months.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    II. DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Shabazz raises multiple objections to his trial and sentence. None has merit. We review and reject each of his arguments in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <em>\n    A. The District Court Did Not Err when It Admitted Evidence Seized from Shabazz's Clothing as well as Shabazz's Post-Arrest Statements.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Shabazz argues that the district court erred when it denied his motions to suppress the contents of his wallet as well as his post-arrest statements. We have explained that \"[a] ruling on a motion to suppress presents a mixed question of law and fact.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Johnson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3984510\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/777/1270/#p1273\">\n    777 F.3d 1270\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1273-74 (11th Cir. 2015) (quoting\n   <em>\n    United States v.

But \"when an argument is first raised on appeal, we review the argument for plain error.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2912438\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/488/1317/#p1321\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The district court did not err.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   1. The Contents of Shabazz's Wallet\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Shabazz challenges the admission of a debit card and the other contents of his wallet, which were seized during a search of the residence at the Cheney Street address. When the agents arrived to execute the search warrant, Shabazz was wearing boxer shorts and a T-shirt. He directed the agents to a pair of pants, and they handed the pants to him after they emptied the pockets. They then seized the contents of the wallet they found, including a debit card in the name of William Malone, Inc. As he did before the district court, Shabazz argues that the contents of the wallet should not have been admitted at trial because the search-warrant affidavit did not establish probable cause. He also makes two novel arguments on appeal: that the wallet was outside the scope of the search warrant and that the search was impermissible under\n   <em>\n    Terry v. Ohio\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6167798\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/392/1/\">\n    392 U.S. 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6167798\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/392/1/\">\n    88 S.Ct. 1868\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6167798\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/392/1/\">\n    20 L.Ed.2d 889\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1968).

Shabazz argues that the affidavit was based on the \"unreliable and uncorroborated statements of Dion McBride,\" which were \"insufficient to provide probable cause.\" But, as the district court explained, the statements by McBride\n   <em>\n    were\n   </em>\n   corroborated. And \"when there is sufficient independent corroboration of an informant's information, there is no need to establish the veracity of the informant.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10542355\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/922/249/#p253\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (alteration adopted) (quoting\n   <em>\n    United States v.

For example, surveillance confirmed that \"McBride and/or [Shabazz]\" used three known addresses to receive fraudulent tax returns. Transaction records established that they obtained debit cards using the identities of inmates. Hotel records and Shabazz's bank records confirmed that Shabazz frequently traveled to Pittsburgh, where McBride lived, for the purpose, according to McBride, of picking up fraudulently issued debit cards. A review of bank records established that, when Shabazz returned to Georgia, withdrawals from automated teller machines were made in Atlanta using the fraudulently issued debit cards. Records from bank accounts controlled by McBride established that McBride received more than $7,000 in wire transfers from Shabazz. Surveillance videos showed Leslie Shabazz withdrawing money from automated teller machines using fraudulent cards. Records from the Georgia Department of Corporations listed Leslie Shabazz as the registered\n   agent for Indigent Inmate. Records from the Georgia Department of Transportation established that Leslie Shabazz resided at the Cheney Street address. An agent observed Shabazz's vehicle at the Cheney Street address. And significant evidence corroborated McBride's statements about his own involvement in the scheme.

Because the pockets of a pair of pants are a reasonable place to look for debit cards and some of the other kinds of evidence identified in the search warrant, the agents did not exceed the scope of the search warrant when they seized the contents of Shabazz's wallet.

The admissibility of evidence of uncharged conduct depends on whether the evidence is extrinsic or intrinsic to the charged offense. If the evidence is \"(1) an uncharged offense which arose out of the same transaction or series of transactions as the charged offenses, (2) necessary to complete the story of the crime, or (3) inextricably intertwined with the evidence regarding the charged offenses,\" then it is admissible as intrinsic evidence as long as it satisfies the requirements of Rule 403.\n   <em>\n    Ford\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4180555\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/784/1386/\">\n    784 F.3d at 1393\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (alterations adopted) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). On the other hand, if the evidence is extrinsic, then Rule 404(b) prohibits its admission unless the evidence is offered for some purpose other than proving the defendant's character \"to show that on a particular occasion [he] acted in accordance with th[at] character.\" Fed.

They were all filed in the names and with the social security numbers of prisoners who had applied to Indigent Inmate. They all claimed refunds for the same time period. They all listed one of fifteen common addresses. And they had other similar features, such as Schedule C forms that claimed large car and truck expenses and false W-2s that listed Revco or CVS, which acquired Revco, as the employer. We disagree with Shabazz that the charged and uncharged returns shared only \"traits inherent in all inmate tax fraud schemes.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Shabazz misunderstands our precedent when he contends that the evidence was inadmissible because it \"was not necessary to prove the conspiracy charged in Count 1\" or otherwise \"required\" to explain the conspiracy.

[he] shouldn't let that spill over into [his] choice of clothes to wear before th[e] jury.\" Although it acknowledged that it could not \"make [him]\" change, it urged him to \"do the smart thing and put [his] suit back on.\" And it explained that it did not \"mind taking the time [to allow him] to put [his] suit on.\" But Shabazz refused the invitation and waited until the jury entered the room to object. As in\n   <em>\n    Graham\n   </em>\n   , the district court \"properly refused to delay the trial\" because Shabazz \"appeared in jail clothes before the jury as a result of his own conduct.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5648327\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/643/885/#p895\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   We also reject Shabazz's argument that the limiting instruction issued by the district court \"compounded the problem by calling undue attention to the inappropriate clothing and placing the blame for such attire solely upon [Shabazz].\" Shabazz never objected to that instruction, and we must presume that the jury followed the instruction not to hold Shabazz's attire against him.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Both worked at another of Shabazz's businesses, and both rented or occupied residences that multiple Indigent Inmate tax returns listed as a taxpayer address.

In support, he cherry picks a stray comment by the district court that it \"can't say that he did not exercise control over\" the individuals involved in the conspiracy. But the context of that statement makes clear that the district court correctly applied the law to the facts.

The district court estimated the loss amount by considering all tax returns that were filed in the names of Indigent Inmate applicants and listed one of fifteen common addresses as the taxpayer address-regardless of whether those addresses were directly or indirectly linked to Shabazz. Shabazz concedes that he may be held accountable for the returns that included the addresses of the four properties he personally leased, but he maintains that it was clear error to consider the returns that included the addresses for the other eleven properties because the government failed to establish by a preponderance of the evidence using \"reliable and specific evidence\" that the addresses were \"connect[ed] to him\" or \"within the scope of any agreement with others.\" We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Ford\n   </em>\n   , we held that the district court did not clearly err when it calculated the loss amount for a tax-fraud scheme based on the losses from returns that used one of several common addresses.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4180555\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/784/1386/\">\n    784 F.3d at 1396-97\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We explained that the district court reviewed summary charts prepared by the Internal Revenue Service and that the investigating agent \"interviewed as many victims as he could locate and visited each address and confirmed that it was highly unlikely that these addresses housed the individuals who were identified as residing there.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4180555\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/784/1386/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4180555\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/784/1386/\">\n    at 1396\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We determined that, \"[h]aving heard this testimony and the trial testimony, and having reviewed the evidence, the district court reasonably concluded that the government had proven by a preponderance of the evidence that the 'common address' returns were fraudulent.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4180555\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/784/1386/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4180555\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/784/1386/\">\n    at 1397\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   The district court was entitled to rely on the same methodology here. The evidence at trial established that Shabazz founded and financed Indigent Inmate. The district court considered only those tax returns that were filed in the names of Indigent Inmate applicants and listed one of fifteen common addresses as the taxpayer address. And eleven of the fifteen addresses\n   were either directly or indirectly linked to Shabazz. For example, Nathan Moore, Shabazz's cousin and employee, owned 1394 Metropolitan Parkway, and Shabazz listed that address as his present address and Moore as the owner of that residence in his rental application for 2945 Orr Drive. And Shabazz permitted his client, Boyd-Gordon, to reside and then take over the lease at one of his properties, and Boyd-Gordon listed Shabazz as an additional occupant when he applied to rent 2007 Sharp Street. Although investigators did not discover a similarly clear link between Shabazz and the remaining four addresses, it was reasonable for the district court to consider the returns that listed those addresses in the light of the significant evidence at trial that linked information from Indigent Inmate applications to fraudulent tax returns that listed a common address that was under Shabazz's control. Even if Shabazz was not personally involved in collecting the fraudulent refunds mailed to those addresses, there was sufficient evidence to conclude that the properties at those addresses were used in the criminal conspiracy. And if a defendant is involved in \"jointly undertaken criminal activity,\" then \"all acts and omissions ... reasonably foreseeable in connection with that criminal activity\" are relevant. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.3(a)(1)(B) ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Rodriguez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4070164\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/751/1244/#p1256\">\n    751 F.3d 1244\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1256 (11th Cir. 2014).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Shabazz responds that\n   <em>\n    Ford\n   </em>\n   is inapposite because, unlike the defendant in\n   <em>\n    Ford\n   </em>\n   , he did not file the returns himself and the methodology resulted in a far higher loss amount here than the loss amount in\n   <em>\n    Ford\n   </em>\n   , but we are unpersuaded. Although Shabazz may not have filed the returns himself, he was similarly connected to the fraudulent returns through Indigent Inmate. And no part of the reasoning in\n   <em>\n    Ford\n   </em>\n   turned on the magnitude of the resulting loss amount. The district court did not clearly err.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   3. The Substantive Reasonableness of the Sentence\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Shabazz argues that his sentence is substantively unreasonable for a variety of reasons that minimize the seriousness of his offenses, belittle the victims of his crimes, and draw irrelevant comparisons between his sentence and average fraud and theft sentences nationwide. We review for abuse of discretion whether a sentence is substantively unreasonable by considering \"the totality of the circumstances\" under the statutory sentencing factors,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203553\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).\n   <em>\n    Cubero\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6056026\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/754/888/#p892\">\n    754 F.3d at 892\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We have underscored that we must give \"due deference\" to the district court because it has an \"institutional advantage\" in making sentencing determinations.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6056026\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/754/888/#p892\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    United States v.

And the party challenging the sentence bears the burden to show that it is \"unreasonable in light of the record and the [ section] 3553(a) factors.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6051160\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/550/1319/#p1324\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Shabazz's sentence is reasonable. His sentence of 277 months of imprisonment was below the low end of the Guidelines range, which was 292 to 365 months, and the district court correctly considered the relevant sentencing factors. It stated that it had \"carefully considered all of the\n   sentencing factors set forth in ... [s]ection 3553(a),\" although it acknowledged that it placed particular weight on \"the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history, characteristics [sic] of the defendant.\" That factor \"predominated ... probably over any one particular factor,\" though \"not over all six of the others.\" We have held that \"[a]n acknowledgment [that] the district court has considered the defendant's arguments and the [ section] 3553(a) factors will suffice.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6051160\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/550/1319/#p1324\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   And though Shabazz maintains that the statements the district court made about the seriousness and mercilessness of his crimes were \"over-kill,\" we have held that a district court may attach \"great weight\" to one factor,\n   <em>\n    Cubero\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6056026\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/754/888/#p892\">\n    754 F.3d at 892\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Shaw\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3429609\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/560/1230/#p1238\">\n    560 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1237 ), including \"the nature and circumstances of the offense,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203553\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1).
