Although the record of her attempts to demonstrate disability is a complicated interplay of medical testimony, the facts to be considered in this appeal may be stated with relative economy, so far as they bear on the two issues raised before us: Whether the administrative law judge (ALJ) lapsed into error in according only slight weight to the testimony of a physician who treated Purdy for a non-displaced fracture of her left femur, and whether the ALJ was entitled to rely on evidence presented by the appellee Commissioner about available jobs that Purdy was qualified to perform.

Purdy's claim was initially denied on March 19, 2012, and again on reconsideration. In November 2012, Purdy filed a request for a hearing, which took place on February 11, 2014. On February 27, 2014, the administrative law judge who presided over Purdy's hearing issued a decision finding that Purdy was not disabled within the meaning of the Social Security Act and denying her claim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   At Step 1, the ALJ found that Purdy had not engaged in substantial gainful activity since filing her application.

The ALJ determined that Purdy retained the residual functional capacity to perform sedentary work in unskilled jobs with simple instructions and occasional interaction with others. The ALJ further determined that Purdy \"should never climb ladders, ropes or scaffolds,\" \"must not use foot controls,\" \"must avoid exposure to hazards, such as unprotected heights,\" and could engage in \"rare balancing, crouching, crawling, kneeling, and climbing of ramps or stairs.\" Add. 23-24.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The ALJ explained that though Purdy claimed that she was unable to lift, bend, sit, stand, walk, or kneel without suffering extreme pain, Purdy's \"statements concerning the intensity, persistence and limiting effects of [her] symptoms [were] not entirely credible.\" Add. 25. In particular, Purdy's October 2011 \"Function Report\" indicated that she was able to cook meals, perform all household chores, go out alone, use public transportation, shop in stores, manage her finances, socialize with friends, and attend meetings. These activities, the ALJ reasoned, established Purdy's ability to perform sedentary tasks. The ALJ also observed, based on the notes from an emergency room visit in April 2012, that \"[i]t seems [Purdy] exaggerates her symptoms and engages in opiate seeking behavior.\" Add. 26.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Significantly for purposes of this appeal, the ALJ accorded little weight to the opinion of Dr. Michael Kessler as provided on an SSA-issued form that Dr. Kessler completed regarding Purdy's ability to perform work-related activities. Dr. Kessler found that Purdy could lift or carry less than 10 pounds occasionally (and nothing frequently); could stand or walk for less than two hours in an eight-hour workday; could sit for about six hours in an eight-hour workday; was limited in her ability to push or pull with her lower extremities; could not climb, balance, kneel, crouch, crawl, or stoop; and could endure only limited exposure to vibration and humidity. Dr. Kessler attributed these limitations in Purdy's functioning to a \"fracture of [the] left femur [with] delayed union.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In the ALJ's view, Dr. Kessler's opinion was conclusory and unsubstantiated: Dr.\n   Kessler had \"simply check marked boxes indicating [Purdy] had limitations that would increase the likelihood of [her] obtaining benefits[,] but did not explain why those limitations were chosen; in particular, he gave no examples of objective laboratory findings, symptoms or other medical evidence to support the conclusions.\" Add. 27.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   By contrast, the ALJ accorded evidentiary weight to the findings of the State agency's non-examining medical and psychological consultants.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Those physicians had agreed, based on their analysis of the evidence in January and September 2012, respectively, that Purdy was capable of performing sedentary work within the limitations identified by the ALJ.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The ALJ completed Step 4 by finding that Purdy had no past relevant work and went on to Step 5, where she determined that there were jobs existing in significant numbers in the national economy that Purdy could perform. That determination was based on the testimony of an impartial vocational expert (VE). The ALJ asked the VE to consider whether jobs were available in the national economy for someone with Purdy's age and education who could lift 10 pounds frequently and 20 pounds occasionally; could stand and walk for two hours in a workday; could sit for six hours in a workday; could rarely balance, crouch, crawl, kneel, or climb; could not work around hazards; could not climb ladders, ropes, or scaffolds; could not operate foot controls; and who could perform only simple jobs with simple instructions, limited changes, and only occasional interaction with the public.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   The VE testified that such an individual could perform the sedentary, unskilled jobs of surveillance system monitor (of which she estimated there were 11,000 jobs in the national economy); document preparer (20,000 jobs in the national economy); and stem mounter (1,400 jobs in the national economy). On the basis of that testimony, the ALJ found that Purdy was not disabled within the meaning of the Social Security Act and denied her application.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The SSA's Appeals Council denied Purdy's request for review, rendering the ALJ's decision the Commissioner's final determination, which Purdy then appealed by bringing this action in federal district court. The magistrate judge recommended affirming the Commissioner's decision, and the district court, on\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   review, adopted the recommendation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    III\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   We review the district court's decision to affirm or reverse a final decision\n   of the Commissioner\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   and the Commissioner's underlying decision for substantial evidence and conformity to relevant law.\n   <em>\n    Seavey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9451142\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/276/1/#p5\">\n    276 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   9 (citing\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20405\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g) ).

The ALJ's factual findings must be supported by substantial evidence and the legal standards must be correct. The relevant legal standard for a claim filed before March 27, 2017 (as Purdy's was) is the rule that a treating physician's opinion is controlling if it is \"well-supported by medically acceptable clinical and laboratory diagnostic techniques and is not inconsistent with the other substantial evidence in [the] case record.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20416.927\">\n    20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.927\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(2). And even if not deemed controlling, a treating physician's opinion is entitled to weight that reflects the physician's opportunity for direct and continual observation.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20416.927\">\n     Id\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20416.927\">\n    .\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   There was, however, no error in the ALJ's determination to give \"little\" weight to Dr. Kessler's opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   To begin with, Dr. Kessler's opinion as reflected on the SSA-issued form made little sense on its face. Dr. Kessler indicated both that Purdy had experienced the same physical limitations since 2011 and that the cause of her limitations was the 2013 femur injury. Moreover, Dr. Kessler provided no discussion or analysis of his own prior observations, as the ALJ noted when she described his submission as merely checking the right boxes. That itself goes a long way toward supporting the ALJ's determination to accord Dr. Kessler's opinion little weight.\n   <em>\n    Matney\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Sullivan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1875152\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/981/1016/#p1019\">\n    981 F.2d 1016\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1019 (9th Cir. 1992) (\"The ALJ need not accept an opinion of a physician-even a treating physician-if it is conclusionary and brief and is unsupported by clinical findings.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   But even more significant were Dr. Kessler's examination and treatment notes. Quite simply, Dr. Kessler's medical records of treating Purdy were at odds with his conclusions purporting to support Purdy's application. Purdy was diagnosed with a probable stress fracture in April 2013. Dr. Kessler's notes tracking the progress\n   of the fracture made it clear that her prognosis was good. In July 2013, for example, Dr. Kessler noted that \"there is a very, very strong chance that she will heal satisfactorily with no surgery.\" There was no displacement of the bone, and the required treatment was to avoid stress on the area so nature could take its course. The last mention of the femur in Dr. Kessler's records was on November 5, 2013, some three months before Purdy's hearing before the ALJ, and then Dr. Kessler noted that Purdy had a good range of motion in both hips and walked with minimal to no limp and without a cane (despite his recommendation). Though Purdy was continuing to experience pain, Dr. Kessler noted that \"chances [were] she [would] end up getting away without having any surgery,\" and that even if the fracture did \"fall apart,\" which Dr. Kessler labelled a \"very small\" risk, it could be fixed with surgery. Dr. Kessler's notes regarding Purdy's three further appointments before her hearing before the ALJ focused on a wrist injury and do not mention the stress fracture, or any pain associated with it, at all.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   No one could reasonably read these records as support for finding or predicating a twelve-month duration of any impairment from the fracture. The contrary is true. There was therefore no legal error in refusing to treat Dr. Kessler's opinion as controlling or in according it little weight for purposes of determining whether the fracture constituted a severe impairment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   For the same reasons, the ALJ did not err in according Dr. Kessler's opinion little weight for purposes of determining Purdy's residual functional capacity. Based on the record and the particular circumstances of this case, the ALJ was entitled to make a \"common-sense judgment[ ]\" that the healing stress fracture did not preclude Purdy from performing some sedentary work.\n   <em>\n    Gordils\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Sec'y of Health &amp; Human Servs.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10543396\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/921/327/#p329\">\n    921 F.2d 327\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 329 (1st Cir. 1990).

The nub of the objection is that the VE testified on the basis of numbers supplied by Job Browser Pro software available from a concern called SkillTRAN.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   SkillTRAN's software has been recognized by at least one district court to be widely relied upon by vocational experts in estimating the number of relevant jobs in the national economy.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Wood\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Berryhill\n   </em>\n   , No. 17 Civ. 5430,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%206419313\">\n    2017 WL 6419313\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3 (W.D. Wash. Nov. 17, 2017) (describing Job Browser Pro as \"the commonly accepted software used by ... vocational experts\"). The software takes as its starting point the\n   <em>\n    Dictionary of Occupational Titles\n   </em>\n   (the DOT), a Department of Labor publication that identifies thousands of jobs by name and describes the skills and capacity for physical exertion required to perform each.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   The DOT \"just\n   <em>\n    defines\n   </em>\n   jobs,\" however; \"[i]t does not report how many such jobs are available in the economy.\"\n   <em>\n    Brault\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Soc.

And while the Government collects job data, it does so at an aggregated group level, rather than by DOT occupation, which renders estimating the number of jobs available in the economy for a given DOT occupation no easy task.

Drawing inspiration from\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"355769\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/509/579/\">\n    509 U.S. 579\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"355769\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/509/579/\">\n    113 S.Ct. 2786\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"355769\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/509/579/\">\n    125 L.Ed.2d 469\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1993), and Federal Rule of Evidence 702, the Seventh Circuit has charged ALJs with a version of the gate-keeping role that federal courts must play when considering whether to admit expert testimony. While recognizing that Rule 702 does not formally apply in Social Security proceedings, the Seventh Circuit has reasoned that \"because an ALJ's findings must be supported by substantial evidence, an ALJ may depend upon expert testimony only if the testimony is reliable.\"\n   <em>\n    McKinnie\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Barnhart\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9246844\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/368/907/#p910\">\n    368 F.3d 907\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 910 (7th Cir. 2004). And \"[i]f the basis of the vocational expert's conclusions is questioned at the hearing ... then the ALJ should make an inquiry (similar though not necessarily identical to that of Rule 702 ) to find out whether the purported expert's conclusions are reliable.\"\n   <em>\n    Donahue\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Barnhart\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9395030\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/279/441/#p446\">\n    279 F.3d 441\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 446 (7th Cir. 2002) (emphasis removed). Thus, in\n   <em>\n    McKinnie\n   </em>\n   , where the vocational expert's proffered basis for her job-estimate figures was vague and unsubstantiated by documentation, the Seventh Circuit held that the ALJ erred by not enquiring into the reliability of the vocational expert's opinion.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9246844\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/368/907/#p910\">\n    368 F.3d at 911\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The Seventh Circuit stands alone, however, in imposing a\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   -like requirement on ALJs in Social Security cases. The Ninth Circuit has disclaimed any such standard for testing the reliability of a VE's testimony regarding the number of relevant jobs in the national economy. Rather, that court has explained that \"[a] VE's recognized expertise provides the necessary foundation for his or her testimony.\"\n   <em>\n    Bayliss\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Barnhart\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1241092\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/427/1211/#p1218\">\n    427 F.3d 1211\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1218 (9th Cir. 2005). And the Second Circuit, too, has cast significant doubt on the Seventh Circuit's approach. In particular, in\n   <em>\n    Brault\n   </em>\n   , the Second Circuit responded to a challenge similar to the one lodged here with the observation that the Seventh Circuit's approach was inconsistent with Congress's clear determination that the Federal Rules of Evidence not apply in Social Security proceedings,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20405\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1),\n   <em>\n    Richardson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11733715\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/402/389/#p400\">\n    402 U.S. at 400-01\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11733715\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/402/389/#p400\">\n    91 S.Ct. 1420\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and deemed it puzzling that the \"the Seventh Circuit would acknowledge ... that ALJs are not bound by the Rules of Evidence, but then turn around and require ALJs to hew so closely to\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   's principles,\"\n   <em>\n    Brault\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3894328\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/683/443/#p446\">\n    683 F.3d at 449\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . For that matter, the Second Circuit was not persuaded that a\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   -like hearing would be useful given the pertinent standard of review. The \"substantial evidence\" standard, the court noted, is \"extremely flexible,\" \"giv[ing] federal courts the freedom to take a case-specific, comprehensive view of the administrative proceedings, weighing all the evidence to determine whether it was 'substantial.' \"\n   <em>\n    Brault\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3894328\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/683/443/#p446\">\n    683 F.3d at 449\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Second Circuit \"thus affirmed, not on any\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   basis, but instead on typical 'substantial evidence' grounds.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3894328\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/683/443/#p446\">\n     Id\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3894328\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/683/443/#p446\">\n    . at 450\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   We fail to see an adequate answer to the Second Circuit's argument. This is not to say that we could go to the extreme of approving reliance on evidence of the software numbers offered by a witness who could say nothing more about them than the name of the software that produced them.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   But that is not the case here. The VE, whose qualifications Purdy did not challenge, testified that the job numbers were from the Bureau of Labor Statistics and were stated in reference to job descriptions in the DOT; that is, they were specific to jobs, not to broad amalgams of jobs, some of which an applicant might be able to perform but not others. The VE testified that the software's conclusions on the described basis were generally accepted by those who are asked to give the sort of opinions sought here. She testified, in other words, to a reliable and practical basis of fact on which analysis was performed, and to a wide reputation for reliability. Given the broad discretion on the part of an ALJ, and the complete lack of any competing evidence or critique, it is hard to see an abuse of discretion in the judge's refusal to demand, say, that a VE perform her own data-gathering field work, or be a statistician capable of duplicating the software analysis of the basic\n   material.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pena\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Comm'r of Soc.

Nor does Purdy seriously confront the question of what more might be required. Rather, she simply couches her objection in the general terms that more personal \"knowledge, experience or expertise\" ought to be required of a VE relying on Job Browser Pro. At this level of generality, the argument is too ethereal to carry the day in demonstrating legal error in the ALJ's judgment to rely on the testimony here.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    IV\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The ALJ's determination that Purdy was not disabled within the meaning of the Social Security Act was supported by substantial evidence.
