As a condition of increasing its licensed generating capacity, Petitioner agreed to design and construct a fishway, which is a facility that would allow American shad\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   to swim past the dam and gain access to upstream spawning grounds. After over a decade had passed-without significant progress on the fishway, and with Petitioner having never increased its generating capacity-the Commission revoked Petitioner's license. As a result, the dam still obstructs the shad, as it always did, but given the action taken by the Commission, the dam can no longer generate hydroelectricity. Petitioner challenges the revocation of its license. Although it is unclear what useful purpose has been served by the above course of events, we conclude that the Commission's decision to revoke Petitioner's license is authorized by law. Accordingly, we deny the petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Although much could be said about the decade-and-a-half talkathon between Petitioner and the Commission over the construction of a fishway at the Juliette\n   Dam as a condition for authorization of increased generating capacity that was never even implemented, we limit our summary of the facts to only those most essential to the disposition of this case. In 1995, Petitioner obtained a license from the Commission to generate 643 kilowatts (\"kW\") of hydroelectricity at the Juliette Dam.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=150%20FERC%2061099\">\n    150 FERC 61099\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 61673-74 &amp; nn. 3-4 (2015). In 2000, Petitioner filed an application to amend its license to increase its generating capacity.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=99%20FERC%2062207\">\n    99 FERC 62207\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 64489 (2002). The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the National Marine Fisheries Service, and the Georgia Department of Natural Resources (collectively, the \"Resource Agencies\") recommended-and the Commission's staff agreed-that a fishway should be constructed to allow American shad to swim past the dam, giving the fish access to additional spawning grounds.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 64489-90.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Thereafter, in 2002, the Commission issued an order approving Petitioner's application, subject to the requirement that Petitioner design and construct a fishway. The Commission amended Petitioner's license \"to increase the total project authorized installed capacity from 643 kW to 1,843 kW.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 64490. The Commission also amended the license to incorporate the conditions imposed by the Water Quality Certification Petitioner received from the Georgia Department of Natural Resources, which required that \"a fish passage structure ... be constructed as part of the project upgrade.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 64492. The Commission \"added to the license\" Article 401, which required Petitioner to \"within 90 days from the date of the issuance of this amendment ... file with the Commission, for approval, a plan to construct a fishway at the Juliette Dam.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 64491. Article 401 also required Petitioner to \"prepare the plan after consultation with\" the Resource Agencies and to include \"(1) a fishway construction schedule; (2) a detailed description of proposed fishway design and operation; (3) a provision for consulting annually with the [Resource Agencies] to address fish passage and entrainment issues at the project; and (4) documentation of consultation with the [A]gencies.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Over the next decade, the expected costs of the fishway began to skyrocket and Petitioner struggled to come to agreement with the Resources Agencies on the details of a fishway design. Nevertheless, Petitioner and the Commission were twice able to come to preliminary agreement-in 2006 and 2012-on general fishway designs, with each agreement resulting in an order from the Commission directing Petitioner to submit finalized specifications and to construct the fishway. After each order, Petitioner ran into problems negotiating with the Resource Agencies, neglected to submit revised specifications and plans, and failed to meet construction deadlines. With each failure by Petitioner to meet the requirements set forth in the Commission's orders, the Commission repeatedly warned Petitioner that it was in violation of its license conditions and that the Commission could revoke Petitioner's license if it continued not to comply.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=149%20FERC%2061036\">\n    149 FERC 61036\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 61143-45 (2014) (summarizing Petitioner's compliance history).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Most relevant here is the aftermath of the Commission's 2012 order.

Accordingly, in December 2012, the Commission issued an order approving the new design, requiring certain modifications, and setting new deadlines for Petitioner.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 64531-32. Among other things, the order required Petitioner to file \"[w]ithin 120 days ... a Fishway Operation Plan which shall describe ... a method for determining the\n   effectiveness of the fishway following its first year of operation (i.e., are the target species finding the fishway entrance and negotiating the fishway).\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 64532. The order further specified that the plan \"shall be developed in consultation with\" the Resource Agencies and that Petitioner \"shall include with the plan documentation of consultation, copies of comments and recommendations on the completed plan after it has been prepared and provided to the [R]esource [A]gencies, and specific descriptions of how the [A]gencies' comments are accommodated by the plan.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In April 2013, after Petitioner missed the deadline to file its revisions and plans, the Commission sent Petitioner a letter instructing Petitioner to file the overdue items within fifteen days.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=144%20FERC%2062211\">\n    144 FERC 62211\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 64485 (2013).

The Commission advised Petitioner that, to comply with its license, Petitioner needed to file effectiveness protocols and documentation of consultation with the Resource Agencies.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Commission warned Petitioner that this was a violation of its license and gave Petitioner sixty days to come into compliance.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   After Petitioner failed to submit plans for effectiveness protocols and documentation of consultation with the Resource Agencies,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , the Commission issued a compliance order in September 2013. The compliance order commanded Petitioner to file within fifteen days \"a plan and schedule for complying with all of the requirements of the December 7, 2012 order,\" including \"specific protocols for monitoring the effectiveness of the fishway\" and \"copies of all correspondence between\" Petitioner and the Resource Agencies.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Commission warned that failure to comply could result in revocation of Petitioner's license.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Although Petitioner submitted some of the requested documents in response (such as an updated construction schedule pushing back construction another year), Petitioner did not submit documentation of consultation with the Resource Agencies or effectiveness protocols.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=147%20FERC%2062045\">\n    147 FERC 62045\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 64164 (2014).

The record, however, supports the Commission.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The Commission revoked Petitioner's license for \"knowingly violat[ing] the September 2013 Compliance Order,\" because, among other things, Petitioner \"never developed the required fishway effectiveness protocols in consultation with the\" Resource Agencies. 149 FERC at 61146. That compliance order required Petitioner to \"file, within 15 days ... a plan ... for complying with all of the requirements of the December 7, 2012 order. ... includ[ing] ... specific protocols for monitoring the effectiveness of the fishway.\" 144 FERC at 64486.

It required that the \"Fishway Operation Plan ... describe ... a method for determining the effectiveness of the fishway\" and be \"developed in consultation with\" the Resource Agencies. 141 FERC at 64532. In addition, the 2012 order specified that Petitioner \"shall include with the plan documentation of consultation, copies of comments and recommendations on the completed plan after it has been prepared and provided to the [R]esource [A]gencies, and specific descriptions of how the [A]gencies' comments are accommodated by the plan.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275293\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/881/823/#p834\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Petitioner was also required to provide \"a minimum of 30 days for the agencies to comment and to make recommendations before filing the plan with the Commission.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275293\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/881/823/#p834\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The record shows that Petitioner understood these requirements at the time the compliance order was issued. Petitioner stated in its response to the compliance order that it had \"actively discussed\" the effectiveness protocols with the Resource Agencies. And Petitioner \"propose[d]\" to \"continue discussions to reach the best reasonable and practical monitoring procedure which we can anticipate.\" Further, before the compliance order was issued, the Commission sent Petitioner two letters expressly stating that the 2012 order required Petitioner to consult with the Resource Agencies over the effectiveness protocols and to provide documentation of such consultations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Because Petitioner never submitted effectiveness protocols or documentation of its consultation with the Resource Agencies, Petitioner violated the compliance order. And, as described above, substantial evidence supports the Commission's conclusion that the violation was done knowingly. The record also shows that Petitioner was given adequate notice and opportunity to be heard and that the\n   Commission took into consideration the nature and seriousness of Petitioner's violation and its compliance efforts. Accordingly, the Commission was authorized under \u00a7 823b to revoke Petitioner's license.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Petitioner makes some other arguments as to why the Commission could not lawfully revoke its license, but none are persuasive. Petitioner argues that the fishway requirements are not part of its license or, if they are, they are tied to its increased generating capacity so that only the authorization for increased capacity can be revoked, not the license in its entirety. The provisions of the license, however, clearly contradict this argument. Petitioner's amended license states unambiguously in Article 401 that Petitioner was required to \"file with the Commission, for approval, a plan to construct a fishway at the Juliette Dam\" prepared \"after consultation\" with the Resources Agencies and to include \"documentation of consultation with the [A]gencies.\" 99 FERC at 64491. Article 401 is a general condition of the license, not tied to only the added generating capacity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Petitioner's above argument is really another way of saying that Petitioner would like to return to the status quo in place prior to 2002 when the Commission approved Petitioner's application to increase its generating capacity. We can understand Petitioner's desire to undo what has turned out to be an ill-advised application on its part. Had Petitioner never sought to increase its generating capacity, the Commission would not have required Petitioner to construct the fishway that has become so problematic. And given how arduous were the negotiations to construct the fishway and how prohibitive Petitioner came to perceive the costs for that project to be, combined with the fact that Petitioner never even increased its generating capacity, it is understandable why Petitioner would now like to go back to where the parties were pre-2002. That is, Petitioner's dam would continue to operate at the same generating capacity in effect at the time-and observed since that time-and no fishway would be required to be built.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The problem for Petitioner in trying to achieve what it now believes to be a common sense resolution to the fishway quagmire is Petitioner's own failure to take the appropriate steps necessary to do so. The Commission repeatedly told Petitioner that it could apply to amend its license to remove the increased generating capacity and the fishway requirements, but Petitioner never did so. Only after the Commission issued the order revoking Petitioner's license did Petitioner attempt to withdraw the application to amend that it had submitted fourteen years earlier: an application that the Commission had long ago granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Petitioner contends that this attempted withdrawal was effective based on\n   <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20385.216\">\n    18 C.F.R. \u00a7 385.216\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . That regulation allows a party to \"withdraw a pleading by filing a notice of withdrawal\" that becomes effective if no motion in opposition or order disallowing withdrawal is filed within fifteen days.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20385.216\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Yet Petitioner cites no authority to suggest that withdrawal of an application to amend that was long ago granted can serve to unilaterally void the amendment. At best, Petitioner argues that the Commission has previously accepted a notice of withdrawal years after it issued a license. But in the only such example cited by Petitioner, the applicant \"filed a timely request for rehearing\" and never actually \"accept[ed] the license.\"\n   <em>\n    Puget Sound Energy, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=106%20FERC%2062038\">\n    106 FERC 62038\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 64078 (2004).
