Sydnor, the judgment of the Court of Civil Appeals must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">The first assignment is to the effect that the court erred in not holding-that the Probate Court of Harrisburg County had no jurisdiction of the-estate of Murphy, and that the entire administration proceedings were-for that reason void, in that Murphy was not at the time of his death an. inhabitant or resident of said county, did not die therein, and did not, at the time administration was granted, nor at any time prior thereto,, have any property therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-7\">Jurisdiction is the power of a court to hear and determine a cause and enforce its decree. The exact legal signification of the word varies with the circumstances under which it is used, and a failure to observe this, fact often produces confusion and leads to the statement of inaccurate legal propositions.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-8\">The question of the validity of judicial proceedings for want of jurisdiction arises in two classes of cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-9\">Thus, there are classes of cases over which a court has not, under the very law of its creation, any possible power: e. g., an administration upon the estate of a living person, administration upon the estate of a deceased soldier when prohibited by statute, and administration in bankruptcy upon the estate of a person deceased before the institution of the-proceedings, a suit for divorce in a foreign country in which neither of the parties is domiciled, or a suit to recover against a non-resident upon service by publication a purely personal judgment. In such cases the-entire proceedings are coram non judice, the law raises no presumptions. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>in their support, and the facts bringing any particular case mfhin one of such classes may be established by evidence dehors the record, either in a direct or collateral attack, for the purpose of destroying the apparent binding force of such proceedings. This is upon the principle that the court, being as a matter of law without power to investigate or determine any question connected with such matters, can not, by a clear usurpation of power, preclude inquiry into the facts establishing such usurpation and the consequent nullity of its proceedings. In such cases the court is without jurisdiction of the subject matter, the status of the parties, or the person of the defendant, as the case may be, and other courts have n'o difficulty or hesitation in ignoring its proceedings or decrees.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">Again, there are classes of cases over which the law has conferred upon the court general judicial power, but its right to exercise such power in a particular case is challenged and the nullity of its proceedings urged, not upon the ground that the case does not belong to one of such classes, but upon the ground that no such state of facts existed or that no such preliminary steps had been taken, as authorized the court to exercise its powers in the given case: e. g., where the power of a Probate Court to grant an administration of an estate or to make an order of sale in a pending administration is called in question, and the validity of its proceedings denied on the ground that no necessity therefor existed, or where the validity of a personal judgment against a resident is questioned upon the ground that the court had not, by service of process or otherwise, acquired jurisdiction over the person of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">Much difficulty has been encountered by the courts, in passing upon this class of cases, in their efforts to shield the citizen from the unwarranted and oppressive exercise of judicial power without unduly prejudicing the property interest of the country, largely dependent upon the validity of judicial proceedings. The validity of the proceedings for want of jurisdiction may be raised in this class of cases, as in the other, in either a direct or collateral attack. On account, however, of the legal presumptions indulged in favor of the validity of the proceedings in this class, which we have seen do not obtain in the other, the time and circumstances under which the attack can be made, the character of evidence by which it must be supported, especially when the attack is collateral, the power of the court to impose -terms as a condition of relief against the record supported- by such presumptions, and the ultimate rights of the parties in case the attack is successful, are in many instances entirely different in the two classes.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-7\">What is a direct and what a collateral attack, and the reasons why, in a collateral attack on a judgment of the class under consideration, evidence of matters dehors the record will not be received, having been discussed in the case of Crawford v. McDonald, recently decided by this court (88 Texas, 630) and cases therein cited, need not be here restated. It may be well to state, however, that the opinion in that case had no reference whatever to the first class of causes above noticed.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-8\">Plaintiffs in error contend that under a proper construction of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>act of 1336, under which this administration was granted, the Probate Court of Harrisburg County had no power to grant administration upon an estate unless the decedent was an inhabitant or resident of such county at the time of his death, and that therefore said court, under the evidence in this case, had no jurisdiction over the estate of Murphy, and its proceedings were wholly void under the rules of law applicable to the first class of cases above discussed. This question was decided adversely to this contention in Pleasants v. Dunkin, 47 Texas, 343, and followed in Brockenborough v. Milton, 55 Texas, 504, and may be considered settled law.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-3\">It is true that the subsequent legislation, referred to in the opinion in the first case as persuasive of the construction adopted, had not been enacted when the administration herein was granted. Such legislation, however, did not enlarge but restricted the jurisdiction of the Probate Court under said act of 1836 as to a certain class of non-resident soldiers, thereby indicating that in the opinion of the lawmaking power such courts were not restricted in their jurisdiction by said act as contended by plaintiffs in error. The court simply adopted the legislative construction, and we see no reason to question its correctness.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-4\">We are of the opinion that the assignment is not well taken; that the court had jurisdiction over the class of cases to which Murphy\u2019s estate belonged, and that this case belongs to the second class of cases above discussed. It will be so considered in passing upon the remaining assignments.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">The next assignment is to the effect that the administration was void, because the petition therefor shows that there was no estate of Murphy to be administered.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">This assignment is predicated upon the statement in said petition that Bressie had purchased the claims of the heirs and that, therefore, it was-virtually an administration upon his own estate. If, however, the allegation be taken as establishing the purchase, it merely transferred to Bressie the interest of the heirs, but such transfer could not defeat or affect the power of the court to administer upon the estate of Murphy.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-7\">The next assignment is to the effect that the court erred in not holding the administration void, because the application was made for administration on three estates in one petition and granted in one order.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-8\">This was a mere error in procedure which can not affect the validity of the proceedings in this collateral attack. It is well settled that where a court of general jurisdiction, in the exercise of its ordinary judicial functions, renders a judgment, in a cause of which it has jurisdiction, such judgment is never void, no matter how erroneous it may appear, from the face of the record\" or otherwise, to be. (Clayton v. Hurt, recently decided by this court and cases cited, 88 Texas, 598.)</p>\n<p id=\"b82-9\">The next two assignments are as follows: \u201cThe court erred in not holding said administration void, because the record shows that there were no debts due from said estate;\u201d and \u201cthe court erred in not holding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>the sale void, because the record shows that it was not ordered or made to satisfy debts against the estate of Murphy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b83-3\">These assignments raise the question indicated in the discussion of the second class of cases mentioned under the first assignment, to the \u25a0effect that, though the court may have had power to grant administrations in the class of cases to which Murphy\u2019s estate belonged and may have had power to grant orders of sales of property, yet \u201cno such state of facts existed\u201d \u201cas authorized the court to exercise its powers\u201d in this case, either to grant the administration or order the sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-4\">They will therefore be considered together.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">We pass without comment the question as to whether the existence of \u25a0debts was necessary to authorize the grant of administration. Assuming that it was necessary to the validity of the order granting administration, \u2022as well as the order authorizing the sale, the question presents itself, does the record negative the existence of debts when read in view of the presumptions indulged by the law in support of the validity of such orders?</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">Under repeated adjudications in this State, by these assignments a \u25a0collateral attack is made upon judgments of a domestic court of general jurisdiction of estates of decedents, by parties to the proceedings in which such judgments were rendered. (Crawford v. McDonald, supra.)</p>\n<p id=\"b83-7\">In such cases it may be considered the settled rule that, if the record \u25a0of the cause in which such judgments were rendered does not negative the existence of the facts authorizing the court to make the particular \u25a0order, the law conclusively presumes that such facts were established, by the evidence before the court when such orders or judgments were rendered, and evidence of .matters dehors the record to the contrary will not be received. As said by Justice Stayton in his able opinion on this \u25a0subject in Martin v. Robinson, 67 Texas, 375: \u201cSuch a court must determine whether the facts exist which make it lawful for administration to be granted in the county in which the court sits; and if, in this respect, having power to make the inquiry, it comes to an erroneous conclusion, its decree founded on such conclusion is voidable but not void.\u201d (Crawford v. McDonald, supra.)</p>\n<p id=\"b83-8\">The petition for administration is silent as to the existence of debts, and the application for the order of sale has been lost and its contents not shown. In such eases it must be presumed that the court found the existence of debts. The fact that the final account did not show any debts antedating the administration does not rebut the presumption in iavor of the judgment of the court, for such debts may have existed and never have been presented or allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-9\">There is no fraud shown in this case, the administration purports to have been had at the instance of the legal assignee of the heirs, no question is made as to the truth of the recitals in the petition for administration, and therefore we are not called upon to decide the question as to whether any presumptions will be indulged in support of decrees rendered in a fraudulent administration.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>The next assignment is to the effect that the court erred in not holding the sale void, because not approved by the Secretary of War, and sixty days\u2019 notice thereof was not given as required by the statutes in force at time of the sale in reference to administration upon the estates of deceased soldiers. (Act approved May 18, 1838; Act approved December 24, 1838.) It is a sufficient answer to this objection to say that those statutes had no application to citizen soldiers, and the evidence above quoted, to the effect th-at Murphy came here as a soldier, and was. killed at Goliad, and that he \"never located or lived in Texas only in the service under Fannin,\u201d does not conclusively establish that he was-not a citizen soldier, for he would be such if under the facts he intended to remain in Texas. The Probate Court, in passing upon the length of' time notice should be given, must be presumed to have known that the laws in force required different notice as to citizen and non-citizen soldiers, and by expressly directing thirty days\u2019 notice to be given in the' order of sale must be presumed to have passed upon the question and determined that Murphy was a citizen soldier; and its judgment must be presumed correct in this proceeding in the absence of clear proof to-the contrary. Again, the inventory and the headlight certificate were read in evidence without objection, and we can not say that they did not justify the finding of the Court of Civil Appeals to the effect that Murphy was a citizen soldier. They seem to indicate that the Probate Court and the officers issuing the certificates, as well as Bressie and his attorneys, at the time so regarded him</p>\n<p id=\"b84-3\">Without entering into any discussion of the subject, we are of the .opinion that after so long a lapse of time, connected with the fact of open and constant assertion of title to the land by those claiming under the probate sale, the evidence was amply sufficient to establish the fact that John S. Sydnor was the purchaser of the 640-acre certificate at such sale, and that the administrator duly transferred same to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-4\">The judgment of the Court of Civil Appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
