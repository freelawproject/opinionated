If, as alleged by the defendant in his answer to the petition, as testified to in the trial and as found by the jury in its answer to the special interrogatory No. 5, the plaintiff was driving his motorcycle on the highway at night without lights, it is difficult to see how this fact can be disregarded in determining the cause of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">Where in an action arising from a motor vehicle collision there is evidence of negligence on the part of the defendant and of contributory negligence on the part of the plaintiff, a jury question exists as to whether such negligence of the plaintiff proximately contributed to the collision. <em>White </em>v. <em>Ohio Power Co., </em>171 Ohio St. 148.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-7\">Where a special finding under Section 2315.16 of the Be-vised Code is inconsistent with the verdict, the former shall control the latter, and the court may give judgment accordingly (Section 2315.17, Bevised Code). The special finding of the jury in this case was that the plaintiff was negligently operating an unlighted vehicle and that the plaintiff\u2019s negligence in this regard proximately contributed to his injuries. Such a finding is, of course, inconsistent with a verdict granting damages to the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-8\">The form of the interrogatories is not defective since they are confined to findings \u201cupon particular material allegations contained in the pleadings controverted by the adverse party,\u201d as provided in Section 2315.16, Bevised Code. See, also, paragraph two of the syllabus, <em>Miller </em>v. <em>McAllister, </em>169 Ohio St. 487. Under these pleadings we are of the opinion that paragraph four of the syllabus in <em>Davison </em>v. <em>Flowers, </em>123 Ohio St. 89, is applicable. Seasonable minds cannot but agree that the plaintiff\u2019s unlighted motorcycle proceeding in the westbound lane and into collision with the defendant\u2019s car was, under the facts of this case, a contributing cause of the collision which resulted in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>the plaintiff\u2019s injuries. The jury\u2019s answers to the interrogatories clearly find that the plaintiff was guilty of contributory negligence barring recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">In view of the language of Section 2315.16, Revised Code, the trial court under the circumstances of this case properly entered judgment for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b219-7\">Taft, C. J., Zimmerman, Matthias, O\u2019Neill, Herbert and Schneider, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b219-8\">Taft, C. J.,</author>\n<p id=\"ABp\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"A4_\">Prior to 1955 our statutes provided that, on request, the jury should \u201cfind upon particular questions of fact\u201d and specified that \u201cwhen a special finding of facts is inconsistent with the general verdict\u201d it should control that verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-9\">Prior to the decision of <em>Davison </em>v. <em>Flowers </em>(1930), 123 Ohio St. 89, this court had held that \u201cthe particular questions of facts \u2018contemplated by the statute are those, the answers to which will establish ultimate and determinative facts, and not such as are only of a probative character\u2019 \u201d (123 Ohio St. 89, 95. See also <em>Bradley, an Infant, </em>v. <em>Mansfield Rapid Transit, Inc. </em>[1950], 154 Ohio St. 154, 161, 162). Hence, the foregoing statutes had been of no use in the trial of negligence actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-10\">In paragraph four of the syllabus of <em>Davison </em>v. <em>Flowers, supra, </em>it is stated: \u201cTwo requests for finding upon particular questions of fact were made by the defendant. (1) Was the defendant negligent?\u2014which the jury answered \u2018yes\u2019\u2014(2) \u2018If your answer to defendant\u2019s request No. 1 is yes, state of what that negligence consisted.\u2019 In view of the fact that more than one specific act of negligence was pleaded and relied on, the court committed error in refusing to submit said second request. Such request and the answer thereto relate to a finding upon a particular question of fact which is of an ultimate and determinative and not of a probative character.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>To the same effect see paragraph two of syllabus in <em>Bradley </em>v. <em>Mansfield Rapid Transit, Inc., supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">These holdings apparently recognize the fact, of which we can take judicial notice, that in almost every petition in an action for negligence, the plaintiff alleges that the defendant was negligent in certain specific respects and that that negligence proximately caused the damages to the plaintiff. This is and has been done notwithstanding what is now Section 2309.04, Revised Code, which states that \u201c* * * the petition * * * must contain * <em>* * </em>a statement of <em>facts </em>constituting a cause of action.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b220-7\">The 1955 amendment to Section 2315.16, Revised Code, provided for findings \u201cupon particular material allegations contained in the pleadings controverted by an adverse party.\u201d In my opinion, this was intended to codify and approve the law as previously declared by our court.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-8\">Certainly, where the adverse party raises no question as to the form of allegations in a pleading (by motion) and denies such allegations, he should be in no position to object to the submission of special interrogatories based upon such allegations on the ground that such allegations are not \u201cmaterial allegations contained in the pleadings\u201d within the meaning of Section 2315.16, Revised Code. Likewise, a party, who makes allegations in a pleading, should not be in a position, when the opposing party seeks to have special interrogatories submitted with respect to such allegations, to contend that they are not \u201cmaterial allegations contained in the pleadings.\u201d</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
