Bryant, </em>v. <em>Akron Metropolitan Park Dist. for Summit County, </em>120 Ohio St. 464, 471, the court said:</p>\n<p id=\"b66-11\">\u201cThere can be no question of the power of the General Assembly to establish park districts and boards of park commissioners, and to define their powers. * * * These are institutions in which all the people of the state are presumably interested and by which they are benefited. Cities have freely exercised these rights, and the state has likewise, though rather sparingly, exercised them. District parks and boards of park commissioners are institutions which differ from state institutions only in the range of the interest and benefit. By the legislation now under consideration provision has been made for park districts, whose benefits are more general than those of the cities and more local than those of the state.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b66-12\">And further on page 490:</p>\n<p id=\"b66-13\">\u201c* * * upon thorough inquiry into the subject we are of the opinion that the Constitution has fully authorized the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>Legislature to create districts, <em>as separate political subdivisions, </em>and to create boards to exercise the <em>governmental </em>activities of the district * * V\u2019 (Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b67-4\">Thus, it becomes very clear that this court has found a park district to be a political subdivision of the state of Ohio which performs a function of the state that is governmental in character.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">We do not find any statutory provision that authorizes a municipality to impose a collection and remittance of an excise tax upon a governmental agency. The authority of the municipality to levy an admission tax is derived from the state Constitution (Section 3, Article XVIII) but it cannot interfere with a politcal subdivision of the state. To permit this would be tantamount to permitting a municipality to levy an excise tax against the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">This court can conclude only that the action of the municipality in imposing the duty of collecting and remitting an excise tax on the park board is an unwarranted interference with a political subdivision of the state not authorizel by statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-7\">For the reasons stated above, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-8\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b67-9\">Taft, C. J., Zimmerman, Matthias and O\u2019Neill, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b67-10\">Herbert and Schneider, JJ., dissent.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b67-11\">Van Nostran, J., of the Fifth Appellate District, sitting for Brown, J.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
