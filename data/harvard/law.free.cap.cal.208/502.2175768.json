This position is supported by the following authorities: <em>People </em>v. <em>Town of Loyalton, </em>147 Cal. 774 [82 Pac. 620, 622]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Los Angeles, </em>133 Cal. 338 [65 Pac. 749]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Town of Ontario, </em>148 Cal. 625 [84 Pac. 205]; <em>People </em>v. <em>San Diego, </em>71 Cal. App. 421 [236 Pac. 377],</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">The statute governing proceedings for the consolidation of cities requires that: \u201cWhenever a petition signed by not less than one-fourth in number of the qualified electors of any municipal corporation as shown by the registration of electors of the county in which such municipal corporation is situated is filed with the legislative body thereof asking that such municipal corporation and any other municipal corporation contiguous thereto designated in such petition and having a greater population be consolidated, such legislative body must without delay call a special election and submit to the electors of such municipal corporation the question whether such municipalities shall be consolidated.\u201d (Stats. 1913, p. 577, sec. 2.)</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">\u25a0 In the case of <em>People </em>v. <em>Los Angeles, supra, quo warranto </em>proceedings were instituted to test the legality of certain annexation proceedings. The provision of the statute governing annexation proceedings with reference to the filing of the petition therefor was substantially the same as the above-quoted provision of the statute relative to consolidation proceedings. In that case, this court said: \u201cThe jurisdiction of the city council to order an election depends \u2022upon the presentation to it of such petition, signed by the required number of electors. Whether it was so signed was a question of fact, submitted by the statute to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>decision of the council; and the question arising on this branch of the ease is whether the adjudication of that question of fact by the city council is conclusive.\u201d The court, in that decision, goes on to say: \u201cAll such adjudications are conclusive against collateral attack, and as the statute has not, in the case, at bar, given any appeal or review by a higher tribunal, it follows that it can be vacated only in the manner and upon the grounds that would justify the vacation of a judgment rendered by a court of record, and a mere error in the adjudication of a question of fact, not procured by fraud extrinsic or collateral to such question, is not a ground upon which it may be vacated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b543-4\">In the case of <em>People </em>v. <em>Town of Loyalton, supra, </em>where proceedings for the incorporation of a town were attacked on the ground of the insufficiency of the petition, this court said: \u201cUnder what appears to be the settled law of this state, the decision of the board of supervisors upon both these questions of fact must be held to be conclusive here. There was no allegation to the effect that the decision was induced by any extrinsic or collateral fraud, and in the absence of any right of appeal or review by a higher tribunal such decision could be vacated only upon grounds which would justify the vacating of a judgment rendered by a court of record.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">A similar question arose in <em>People </em>v. <em>Town of Ontario, supra, </em>and the ruling in the case of <em>People </em>v. <em>Los Angeles, supra, </em>was followed, as it must be followed in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">The judgment appealed from is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-7\">Curtis, J., Preston, J., Shenk, J., Seawell, J., Richards, J., and Waste, C. J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-8\">Rehearing denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-9\">All the Justices concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
