F. No. 13357), <em>ante, </em>p. 193 [281 Pac. 61], this day decided, is sought to be revived. This cannot be done.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>No serious question is raised as to any matter or item of accounting except the main question which is foreclosed by <em>Bauer </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra. </em>We have examined the account and feel satisfied that it was justly settled. Many items were examined, passed upon and allowed or disallowed as the justice of the situation seemed to warrant. The allowances made to the attorney and executors for extraordinary services performed, considering the many proceedings instituted and objections made during the course of administration in an effort to oust them and obstruct them in the settlement of the estate, do not appear to be unreasonable. Neither do we find any error committed in the matter of distribution.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">The decree and orders are affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
