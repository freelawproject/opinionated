Far well Co., appellants, .and I. P. Norton, to compel'the defendants to pay to him attorney\u2019s fees included in judgment notes taken by them from Thompson &amp; McLean when the makers were insolvent, and afterwards reduced to judgment and collected, and to enforce an alleged verbal agreement between complainant and the president of said bank that the bank should pay complainant one-half of any loss he might sustain through failure to collect from said Thompson &amp; McLean certain debts due from them.</summary><summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b555-14\" pgmap=\"555(54) 556(349) 557(33)\">\u201cThe bill alleged that complainant recovered a judgment in vacation, January 21, 1891, against Thompson &amp; McLean for \u00a74200 damages, and costs, on which execution was issued the same day, and returned June 15,1891, satisfied as to \u00a7624.91 and unsatisfied as to the balance, which judgment remained in full force; that Thompson &amp; McLean had been insolvent since January 1,1891; that on January 19, 1891, they gave John V. Farwell Co. a judgment note for $2473.83 and $250 attorney\u2019s fee, upon which the payee, knowing the insolvency, entered judgment January 21,1891, and collected the same out of the property of said insolvents; that on January 20, 1891, said insolvents gave I. P. Norton a judgment note for $220 and $25 attorney\u2019s fee, on which judgment was entered January 21,1891, which was collected in full; that on January 21, 1891, said insolvents gave to the bank a judgment note for $2043.67 and $102.18 attorney\u2019s fee, on which judgment was entered the same day and which was collected in full; that said Thompson &amp; McLean, on December 1, 1890, and prior thereto, were indebted to complainant about $4000, on account of his being surety for them, with one Johnson, as Johnson, Thompson &amp; McLean, to said bank, John V. Farwell Go. and Locke, Hulet &amp; Co., and were also indebted to said bank on other notes on which complainant was not surety and on which the bank had no security; that about January 17, 1891, it was agreed between complainant and the bank that nothing should be done by either toward collecting said indebtedness until Thompson &amp; McLean should complete an inventory of stock then being made, and that they would work together in protecting their claims, and in case of loss on either of said claims, would bear it equally; that the bank disregarded its agreement, and obtained said note and judgment covering only the unsecured debt to it, and sued Johnson, Thompson &amp; McLean and complainant on the note on which complainant was surety, then amounting to $3671.89; that complainant had been compelled to pay Locke, Hulet &amp; Co. $237.60 on his said liability as surety for them, and that complainant\u2019s total loss, after deducting the amount collected on execution and the profit realized by him on goods purchased at sheriff\u2019s sale, amounted to $2400, one-half of which the bank should pay under said agreement. The prayer of the bill was that the defendants should be decreed to pay complainant said attorney\u2019s fees, and that the bank should be decreed to pay to him one-half of his said loss.</summary><summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b557-3\" pgmap=\"557\">\u201cThe bank, in its answer, denied the making of the alleged agreement, as well as the authority of any officer of the bank to make an agreement of that kind, and pleaded the Statute of Frauds as a defense to such alleged agreement.</summary><summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b557-4\" pgmap=\"557\">\u201cThe answer .of John Y. Farwell Co. denied any knowledge on January 19,1891, of the insolvency of Thompson &amp; McLean, and admitted the taking of the judgment note with attorney\u2019s fee, but averred that it was taken in renewal of previous notes, given when complainant represented the makers to be insolvent, which contained provisions for attorney\u2019s fees.</summary><summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b557-5\" pgmap=\"557\">\u201cThe court, on a hearing of the cause, found that the complainant was entitled to the relief pra;md for, and referred the cause to the master to state the account and find the net loss of complainant because of his surety-ship. The master reported that complainant, as surety for Thompson &amp; McLean, was compelled to pay the bank $3500 and Locke, Hulet &amp; Co. $237.80; that after crediting $624.71 realized on execution, $900 profit made on sale of goods, $250 attorney\u2019s fee to be paid back by John Y. Farwell Co. and $25 attorney\u2019s fee to be paid back by Norton, the amount paid by complainant as such surety was $1938.86, and that there was due complainant from the bank, under the agreement, one-half of that sum, or $969.43.</summary><summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b557-6\" pgmap=\"557(70) 558(12)\">\u201cObjections and exceptions to said report were overruled, and the court decreed that John Y.

Fafwell Co., and that Thompson &amp; McLean were insolvent, but he had not then paid any qf said liabilities. The judgment note was given for the purpose of indemnifying him for what he would have to pay, and it was taken and judgment entered for that purpose. Before the hearing he paid the judgment on the $3500 note, amounting to $3976.66, and the account of $237.80.\u201d</summary><summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b558-5\" pgmap=\"558\">The Appellate Court affirmed the decree as to John V.

The determination of this question is dependent on whether the agreement is an original and independent one, or whether collateral to the agreement of another person, whereby the promise is to answer for the debt or default of that other. In the first case it is not within the statute, in the second it is. Eddy v. Roberts, 17 Ill. 505 ; Resseter v. Waterman, 151 id. 169.</p> <p id=\"b559-10\" pgmap=\"559(61) 560(177)\">The question whether an agreement is an original and independent one is often attendant with much difficulty in .its determination. In this case, Thompson &amp; McLean were primarily liable and the principal debtors, and if the agreement was made as claimed, their liability was in no manner changed thereby. By their discharge of their indebtedness neither party to the agreement would have had to pay any sum to the other, even if the agreement had been in writing and a sufficient consideration for the promise of each to the other. The promise, if any was made by the bank, was a collateral promise. There was no change in the original indebtedness, the original debtors remaining liable to the original creditors precisely the same as when the indebtedness was originally contracted. Spear had no lien of any kind and gave up and yielded no right he had against the debtors, but, as he says, he orally undertook to share with the bank its loss, if any, on the $2000 note, and the bank, as Spear says, undertook orally to share with Spear any loss he might have by reason of his being security for debtors,\u2014 that is, the promise of each was a collateral undertaking to be answerable for the debt of Thompson &amp; McLean, and Johnson, Thompson &amp; McLean, if Thompson &amp; McLean should make default in payment. Such a contract is within the statute.</p> <p id=\"b560-5\" pgmap=\"560\">It is urged that the promise of the bank president was founded upon a new and independent consideration moving from appellee to appellant by the agreement that each should share the loss jointly sustained, and each should delay action until a certain fixed time, and then to take action only upon consultation with the other, and that this promise was for the mutual advantage of the contracting parties. The promise to share the loss is the material thing promised, and that promise was collateral to the debt of Thompson &amp; McLean to each of the parties, and if it be admitted that the consideration of the promise of one\" to the other is sufficient as a consideration, still the requirement of the statute that the agreement shall be in writing is not complied with, and the promise would still be void. Eddy v. Roberts, supra.</p> <p id=\"b560-6\" pgmap=\"560\">From a consideration of the record we must affirm the judgment of the Appellate Court. \"</p> <p id=\"b560-8\" pgmap=\"560\">Judgment affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
