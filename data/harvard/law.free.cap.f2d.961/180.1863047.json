The court sentenced defendant to two concurrent 87 month sentences on Counts One and Three and to a five year sentence on Count Two running consecutive to those on Counts One and Three.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-17\">Defendant now appeals, challenging only the application of the official victim provision to enhance his offense level and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-18\">We must uphold Bailey\u2019s sentence unless it \u201cwas imposed as a result of an incorrect application of the sentencing guidelines.\u201d 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3742(e)(2) (West 1985 and Supp.1991); <em>see also U.S. v. Crawford, </em>906 F.2d 1531, 1536 (11th Cir.1990). We must accept the district court\u2019s findings of fact unless clearly erroneous and \u201cgive due deference to the district court\u2019s application of the guidelines to the facts.\u201d 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3742(e). <em>See Crawford, </em>906 F.2d at 1536.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-19\">The party seeking to invoke a sentence adjustment pursuant to a guidelines provision has the burden of proving that the provision applies. <em>U.S. v. Wilson, </em>884 F.2d 1355, 1356 (11th Cir.1989). Therefore, the government has the burden of proving that \u00a7 3A1.2 applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-20\">The enhancement provision involved, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3A1.2(a) states, <em>inter alia:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-21\">\n<em>Official Victim</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AmF\">If\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-22\">(a) the victim was ... an officer or employee included in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1114 ... and the offense of conviction was motivated by such status ... increase by 3 levels.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b297-23\">This language indicates that enhancement for an official victim is mandatory. Application Note 1 of the Commentary to \u00a7 3A1.2 instructs that enhancement should be invoked only in those cases in which \u201cspecified individuals are victims of the offense\u201d rather than organizations, agencies, or the government in general. Application Note 4 defines \u201cmotivated by such status\u201d as \u201cthe offense of conviction was motivated by the fact that the victim was a ... person covered under 18 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>\u00a7 1114_\u201d The Note warns that enhancement should not be invoked in situations where the crime was motivated by a personal dispute between two employees of the same governmental agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">As noted above, 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1114 includes \u201cofficer or employee of the Postal Service\u201d in its compendium of official victims.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">Defendant contends that two factors must have been present to justify application of \u00a7 3A1.2 to enhance his sentence. First, the victim must have been an official within the scope of \u00a7 1114. Defendant concedes that the postmistress falls within the scope of the statute. Second, the offense must have been motivated by the official status of the victim. Defendant contends that the government has not met its burden of demonstrating that the armed robbery was motivated by the victim\u2019s status as a Postal Service employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-7\">At trial the government presented the following evidence. Defendant entered the Fountain, Florida post office and asked the postmistress for information regarding a Fountain resident. The postmistress was the only employee present. The postmistress gave some information to defendant and he left. He returned, again asking the postmistress about the Fountain resident. Unable to learn anything more about this resident, he then asked the postmistress for a $150 money order. As she was preparing the money order, defendant displayed his gun to her and demanded the money orders along with the money order validation machine, which she handed to him. Defendant did not demand any of the postmistress\u2019 personal belongings. Defendant forced the postmistress into the back room of the post office and used adhesive tape to bind her hands, feet, and mouth. While no direct evidence of defendant\u2019s motivation in selecting this particular victim was presented at trial, the record demonstrates that defendant robbed the postmistress because, as a postal employee, she was in possession of money orders and a money order validation machine.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-8\">The district court adopted the presen-tence report\u2019s factual findings and guidelines applications with the exception of several recommended adjustments unrelated to \u00a7 3A1.2. The presentence report-summarily addressed the applicability \u25a0 of \u00a7 3A1.2 as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-10\">1119. Guideline 3A1.2 provides for an increase of 3 levels if the victim was an \u201cofficial victim\u201d as described in 18 USC 1114. Since the victim was a postal employee, 3 levels are added.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b298-11\">The court\u2019s computation of defendant\u2019s offense level indicates that it followed this recommendation.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-12\">At the sentencing hearing defendant objected to the recommended application of \u00a7 3A1.2 on the ground that the armed robbery was not motivated by the victim\u2019s official status. The court overruled the defendant\u2019s objection observing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-13\">She\u2019s a postmistress.... He knew it and he came in and looked at the place. She was a public official. She was performing her public duty at the time and she got robbed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b298-14\">Defendant continued to object, contending that he robbed this particular victim only because she was in possession of the money orders and money order validation machine and not because she was an official. The court responded that the victim was in possession of the money orders and machine at that time solely because of her official status as a Postal Service employee and that defendant\u2019s commission of an armed robbery upon her was a result of her official status. The court concluded that defendant\u2019s sentence should be enhanced three levels.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-15\">The court in <em>U.S. v. Sanchez, </em>914 F.2d 1355, 1362-63 (9th Cir.1990), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 111 S.Ct. 1626, 113 L.Ed.2d 723 (1991), a \u00a7 3A1.2 case, reasoned, just as the district court did here, that defendant was fully aware of the victim\u2019s official status and \u201cthat the assault was motivated by that knowledge.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In <em>U.S. v. Schroeder, </em>902 F.2d 1469, 1471 (10th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014;\u2014, 111 S.Ct. 181, 112 L.Ed.2d 145 (1990), the court vacated a \u00a7 3A1.2 sentence enhancement on the ground that the official victim was merely the recipient rather than the object <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>of a criminal threat. While Bailey did not rob the postmistress of her personal belongings, the present case is clearly distinguishable from <em>Schroeder </em>insofar as defendant subjected the postmistress to having her hands, feet, and mouth bound.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-4\">The enhancement of defendant\u2019s sentence pursuant to \u00a7 3A1.2 was not clearly erroneous. 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3742(f)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
