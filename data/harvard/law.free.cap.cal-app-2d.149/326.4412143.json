It was conceded at the hearing that there was no evidence to establish that the convictions involved moral turpitude.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-3\">The hearing officer in his proposed decision found that the Doctor had been convicted of the two felonies and proposed a one-year suspension of his license to practice medicine and that the execution of such a penalty be suspended for three years on specified terms and conditions. The Board did not adopt the proposed decision, notified the parties accordingly and afforded to them an opportunity to file written arguments with the Board. The Board then determined the case and found that the Doctor had been convicted of the felonies in question and ordered that his license be suspended for one year. The Doctor petitioned for a rehearing, which was denied by the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\">The Doctor then sought a writ of mandamus in the superior court in Los Angeles County, the purpose of which was to set aside the order of the Board. The administrative record was incorporated in the Doctor\u2019s first amended petition for a writ of mandate. The demurrer of the Board to the petition was sustained without leave to amend and a judgment of dismissal was thereafter made and entered. This appeal is from the judgment of dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">The Doctor contends that a conviction of a felony, not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>involving moral turpitude, based on a plea of <em>nolo contendere, </em>is not a ground for disciplinary action against a physician and surgeon under section 2383 of the Business and Professions Code. The Board asserts, in this connection, that a conviction of a felony and a conviction of a criminal offense involving moral turpitude are separate, distinct and different grounds for disciplinary action. Further, that by the statute, a conviction following a plea of <em>nolo contendere </em>to a charge of a felony is expressly deemed to be a conviction for the purposes with which we are here concerned. The Doctor also contends that the convictions do not constitute felonies under the California law.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-4\">The Doctor further argues that the statute in question is an <em>ex post facto </em>law as to him, in that the offenses were committed in 1947 and 1948, and it was the 1951 amendment to the law which was applied to him. He also claims that it was an abuse of discretion for the Board to suspend his license to practice medicine for one year.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">Section 2383 of the Business and Professions Code is set forth in a footnote hereto.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> When the section was added to the statutes in 1937, it consisted of the first two sentences of the section as now constituted, excepting that there was no comma following the word \u201cfelony,\u201d and no comma following the word \u201cturpitude\u201d in the first sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">In 1951, the section was amended by adding the commas to the first sentence and the balance of the section.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-7\">Title 26, U.S.C., section 145(b) (1939 Code), reads in part as set forth in the footnote hereto.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b346-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>In our opinion, the Doctor failed to state a cause of action warranting the issuance of a writ of mandate.  The use of the disjunctive in the section in question, that is, \u201cThe conviction of a felony, <em>or </em>of any offense involving moral turpitude, constitutes unprofessional conduct\u201d (emphasis added) \u2014makes it abundantly clear that the Legislature intended that the <em>conviction of a felony </em>in and of itself, without any qualifications, constitutes unprofessional conduct. It is also clear that \u201cany offense involving moral turpitude, constitutes unprofessional conduct\u201d\u2014and such conduct does not necessarily have to be a felony.  Further, for the purposes of this proceeding, the record of conviction is conclusive evidence of the questioned conduct, and by the very terms of the section itself, a \u201cplea of <em>nolo contendere </em>made to a charge of a felony <em>or </em>of any offense involving moral turpitude\u201d (emphasis added)-\u2014is deemed to be a conviction within the meaning of the section. <em>(Lorenz </em>v. <em>Board of Medical Examiners, </em>46 Cal.2d 684, 686 [298 P.2d 537].)</p>\n<p id=\"b346-3\">Under the federal law it is the punishment which the statute authorizes which determines whether the crime is a felony or a misdemeanor. <em>(Cartwright </em>v. <em>United States, </em>146 F.2d 133, 135.)</p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\">For disciplinary purposes the law of the jurisdiction where the crime was committed determines the character of the offense as a felony or a misdemeanor. <em>(Caminetti </em>v. <em>Imperial Mut. L. Ins. Co., </em>59 Cal.App.2d 476, 490 [139 P.2d 681]; <em>Karrell </em>v. <em>Watson, </em>116 Cal.App.2d 769, 771, 774 [254 P.2d 651, 255 P.2d 464] ; <em>Murrill </em>v. <em>State Board of Accountancy, </em>97 Cal.App.2d 709, 710, 712 [218 P.2d 569].)</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">The statute here clearly intended to make the conviction of a felony in the federal courts grounds for disciplinary action. The use of the words <em>\u201cnolo contendere\u201d </em>are, for all intents and purposes, meaningless, unless the Legislature so intended, for there is no such plea in the California state courts, and there is such a plea in the federal courts. Had the Legislature not so intended, it could, and undoubtedly would have used language such as is contained in sections 2391.5 and 2390 of the Business and Professions Code, where the restrictive term \u201cstatutes of this State\u201d is Used.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">The contention that the 1951 amendment is an <em>ex post facto </em>law as to the Doctor is without merit. It is the law that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>\u201cthe phrase, ex post facto laws, is not applicable to civil laws, but to penal and criminal laws, which punish no party for acts antecedently done which were not punishable at all, or not punishable to the extent or in the manner prescribed.\u201d <em>(Watson </em>v. <em>Mercer, </em>8 Pet. (U.S.) 88 [8 L.Ed. 876, 884].) The Supreme Court of this state, in <em>Foster </em>v. <em>Police Comrs., </em>102 Cal. 483 [37 P. 763, 41 Am.St.Rep. 194], in substance, held to the same effect and further said (at page 492), \u2018\u2018 [t] hough not an <em>ex post facto </em>law, it is retrospective insofar as it determines from the past conduct of the party his fitness for the proposed business. Felons are also excluded from obtaining such license, not as an additional punishment, but because the conviction of a felony is evidence of the unfitness of such persons as a class; nor can we perceive why such evidence should be more conclusive of unfitness were the act done after the passage of the ordinance than if done before.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">The revocation or suspension of a license is not penal, but rather, the Legislature has provided for such to protect the life, health and welfare of the people at large and to set up a plan whereby those who practice medicine will have the qualifications which will prevent, as far as possible, the evils which could result from ignorance or incompetency or a lack of honesty and integrity.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">The Doctor in this case was convicted in 1953, and the suspension was not based upon substantive acts which occurred in 1947 and 1948. The disciplinary action is predicated solely upon the two felony convictions in 1953, almost two years after the law was amended and was in full force and effect. <em>(Karrell </em>v. <em>Watson, supra, </em>116 Cal.App.2d 769, 774.)</p>\n<p id=\"b347-7\">It is urged that in the case of <em>In re Hallinan, </em>43 Cal.2d 243 [272 P.2d 768], which involved an attorney at law, the Supreme Court specifically held that a conviction of a felony is insufficient to justify disciplinary action unless there is a showing of moral turpitude. Counsel state that it is difficult for the Doctor to understand how the doctor should be treated one way and the attorney another. Suffice it to say that the law is different as to each of them and that the Legislature amended the section having to do with the doctor in 1951, as heretofore set forth, and it did not amend section 6101 of the Business and Professions Code, which has to do with the attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-8\">The Hallinan case, heretofore referred to, does not hold that a conviction following a plea of <em>nolo contendere </em>made to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>charge of a felony may not be declared to be grounds for disciplinary action by statute. Under the State Bar Act a conviction without moral turpitude is insufficient for summary disciplinary proceedings, and, at the time of the first Hallinan decision, the <em>nolo contendere </em>plea was not designated as a conviction by statute. Under the Medical Practice Act, a hearing is required, a conviction of a felony is an independent ground for disciplinary action without regard to whether moral turpitude was in fact involved, and a conviction following a <em>nolo contendere </em>plea was expressly defined as a conviction for disciplinary purposes. In <em>In re Hallinan, </em>48 Cal.2d 52 [307 P.2d 1], the court held that the evidence disclosed that Hallinan had intentionally and for the purpose of personal gain filed false income tax returns and ordered that he be suspended from the practice of law in the state for three years.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-3\">The remaining contention of the Doctor is that it was an abuse of discretion to suspend the Doctor\u2019s license for one year. The extent of the penalty within the Board\u2019s discretion is for the Board to determine. The penalty imposed against the Doctor was well within the power of the Board.
