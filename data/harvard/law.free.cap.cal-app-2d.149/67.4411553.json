They agreed to personally make such reimbursement. Therefore we need consider this matter no further.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>Appellant\u2019s notice of appeal from the decree of distribution was filed February 2, 1955. On February 9 she filed a request for a reporter\u2019s transcript which apparently was not to include the testimony of the attorneys above mentioned. On February 16, naturally assuming from the fact that as appellant had appealed from the entire decree including the \u201cfixing of attorneys\u2019 fees and costs, and for additional compensation for extraordinary services rendered by administratrix with the will annexed, and her attorneys,\u201d that appellant was attacking the awards therein to the seven sets of attorneys, respondent on February 16 requested that the testimony of said attorneys as to the services rendered the estate by them be included in the transcript. February 21, the clerk sent appellant\u2019s attorneys an estimate of the cost of preparing the transcript on appeal, which included the cost of transcribing said testimony, the latter being $452.70. February 23, appellant filed a request for correction of transcript. It was set for hearing March 8. March 16 appellant filed an amended notice of appeal withdrawing her appeal as to certain portions of the decree including those portions allowing fees to said attorneys.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On April 28, a minute order was entered denying \u201cthe motion to vacate estimate cost of preparing the Clerk\u2019s and Reporter\u2019s Transcript on appeal made on the 21st day of February, 1955. \u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">No transcript of the proceedings on March 8 appears in the record. As, at that time, appellant\u2019s appeal was still from the entire decree of distribution, the court properly refused to eliminate the requested testimony from the transcript and its cost from the estimate.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">The order is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-7\">Peters, P.
