Clapp, </em>Assistant Attorney General, for the Commonwealth.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b563-12\"><em>D. A. Foley, (M. L.

L. [Ter. Ed.] c. 29, \u00a7 18); but that the Governor and Council have taken no action thereon, and the money has not been paid. As we construe the petition, breach of the contract of settlement is the gist of the petitioners\u2019 case.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-13\">The principal contentions of the respondent are that the department of public works had no authority to make the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>settlement, and that, at least in the absence of authority specifically given to others, any such settlement can be made only by the Governor with the advice and consent of the Council. See G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 79, \u00a7 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">The department of public works had authority to make a settlement binding upon the Commonwealth. G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 81, \u00a7 7, gives the department authority to take land \u201cby eminent domain on behalf of the commonwealth under chapter seventy-nine\u201d for the purposes of a State highway. It may fairly be inferred from the petition that the settlement was made under \u00a7 39 of said c. 79. That section permits \u201cthe body politic or corporate\u201d which is liable for damages to effect a settlement with the person entitled thereto. In this instance the \"body politic\u201d was the Commonwealth. Of course the Commonwealth must act through its lawfully authorized officers, and the officers authorized to take the land were the members of the department. If it be said that a settlement is not a taking, yet \u00a7 39, under which this settlement was made, is an integral part of the eminent domain statute. That section by its own terms becomes operative only after there has been a taking and \u201cafter the right to . . . damages has become vested.\u201d It describes one of the steps in the condemnation proceedings and furnishes a means by which either a settlement may be effected without a trial or an offer made which will reduce the liability for interest. We think that when the Legislature gave to the department power to take land by eminent domain \u201cunder chapter seventy-nine\u201d it intended to give to the department full and complete power to carry the necessary proceedings through to a final termination, with all the incidents and alternatives set forth in c. 79. It would be strange if a department which has authority to take the land and to make the initial award required by \u00a7 6 of c. 79 should be powerless when it becomes advisable to effect a settlement under \u00a7 39 of that chapter, especially as the initial award itself can be recovered under \u00a7 41, and no offer under \u00a7 39 can be of a less amount than the award.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">An examination of the history of G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 81, \u00a7 7, points toward the same conclusion. It is clear that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>former Massachusetts highway commission, to whose powers the present department of public works has succeeded (St. 1919, c. 350, \u00a7\u00a7 111, 113), had authority to effect binding settlements of damages for highway takings. St. 1894, c. 497, \u00a7 3. Neither in the subsequent amendments to the statutes relating to State highways nor in the gathering together into what is now G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 79 of the former scattered statutes relating to eminent domain is there manifest any intent to deprive the department in control of State highways of its authority to represent the Commonwealth in the matter of settlements for State highway taldngs.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">There is nothing in c. 2, \u00a7 1, art. 11, of the Constitution or in G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 29, \u00a7 18, which affects the right of the petitioners to recover on this petition. The purpose of those provisions was to insure that no payments should be made from the public treasury except for public purposes and in accordance with the law. It was not the purpose to give the Governor and Council power to veto contracts or purchases lawfully made by authorized officers or to refuse to honor debts and obligations lawfully incurred. See <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>13 Allen, 593; <em>Boston &amp; Albany Railroad </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>296 Mass. 426; <em>Daly </em>v. <em>Mayor of Medford, </em>241 Mass. 336, 339; <em>Godfrey Coal Co. </em>v. <em>Gray, </em>296 Mass. 323, 325. G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 258, under which petitions against the Commonwealth are brought, provides in \u00a7' 3 that if the decision is in favor of the petitioner, \u201cthe governor shall draw his warrant\u201d for the amount found due.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">The respondent further suggests in favor of its demurrer that the department has no authority to take land for any highway except a \u201cstate highway,\u201d and therefore that the petitioners should have alleged that the taking was for a \u201cstate highway.\u201d We think, however, that the petition, taken as a whole, should be construed as alleging a valid taking by the Commonwealth for the \u201cpublic highway\u201d to which it refers, and that if it is necessary to such valid taking that the \u201cpublic highway\u201d be a \u201cstate highway,\u201d it should be deemed that a \u201cstate highway\u201d was meant.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-7\">\n<em>Order overruling demurrer affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
