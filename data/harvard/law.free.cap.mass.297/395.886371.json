The defendant Cunningham was its servant. The defendant Sarah C. Hall owned an automobile, and was insured by the defendant Aetna Life Insurance Company under the Massachusetts' compulsory motor vehicle liability insurance law. G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 90, \u00a7 34A. It is agreed that on October 29, 1934, Sarah C. Hall \u201cgave her daughter-in-law, Marguerite A. Hall, permission to use the . . . automobile, to drive to Boston, and to park in a private parking space if she wanted to, and to allow the attendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>to drive the car around within the parking space so far as necessary to allow other automobiles to get out.\u201d Marguerite A. Hall left the automobile in the care of the defendant General Trading Company within its parking place, with implied consent to drive it therein, paid the parking charge, and went away.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-3\">The defendant Cunningham, coming on duty later as attendant at the parking place, drove Mrs. Hall\u2019s automobile out of the parking place and stopped it at a point on Bowdoin Street where parking was prohibited. He did this to make room for an automobile in the middle of the parking place to get out. After he had returned to the parking place to relieve the congestion further, Mrs. Hall\u2019s automobile started, coasted down Bowdoin Street, and hurt the plaintiff. He obtained judgment in tort for negligent personal injury against Cunningham and the General Trading Company. He then brought this bill, under G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 175, \u00a7\u00a7 112, 113; c. 214, \u00a7 3 (10), to reach and apply in satisfaction of the judgment the obligation of the defendant Aetna Life Insurance Company under the compulsory liability policy issued to Sarah C. Hall. From a decree for the plaintiff the insurer appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-4\">That policy, as required by G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 90, \u00a7 34A, provided indemnity, not only to the insured but also to \u201cany person responsible for the operation of the insured\u2019s motor vehicle with his express or implied consent,\u201d against loss by reason of the liability to pay damages to others for bodily injuries \u201carising out of the ownership, operation, maintenance, control or use upon the ways of the commonwealth of such motor vehicle.\u201d In <em>Blair </em>v. <em>Travelers Ins. Co. </em>291 Mass. 432, 434, it was said that earlier cases had \u201c settled that a statutory policy of insurance such as this must be construed broadly to effectuate the legislative purpose that automobiles actually permitted to be on the public ways be covered by indemnity insurance for the benefit of persons who may suffer personal injury through their operation; that the bailee of an automobile becomes 'responsible\u2019 to the owner for its operation; and that the required ' consent\u2019 is consent to the bailment, not consent-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>to the particular use which is being made of the automobile at the moment of the accident.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b433-3\">In the present case, the bailment to the General Trading Company was designed to keep the automobile wholly off the public ways. There is nothing to show that either the owner or her daughter-in-law authorized or contemplated its removal from the parking place to Bowdoin Street.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-4\">But the General Trading Company and Cunningham as its servant were authorized, as the parties agreed, to operate the automobile within the limits of the parking place. They thus became \u201cresponsible for the operation of the insured\u2019s motor vehicle with his Cher] express or implied consent,\u201d within G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 90, \u00a7 34A. The case of <em>Novo </em>v. <em>Employers\u2019 Liability Assurance Corp. Ltd. </em>295 Mass. 232, where the bailment to the operator was without the consent of the owner, does not apply. The statute does not by its terms require that the responsibility, consented to by the insured, be for the operation of the automobile upon the ways of the Commonwealth or in any other place. It requires only that the insured consent to responsibility on the part of the person, against whom judgment is obtained, for the operation of the automobile somewhere, and that the judgment be based upon an operation or use of the. automobile \u201cupon the ways of the commonwealth.\u201d In <em>Dickinson </em>v. <em>Great American Indemnity Co. </em>296 Mass. 368, 370, it did not appear that the owner authorized the operation of the motor vehicle anywhere on the occasion in question. We think that the fact that Cunningham, as servant of the General Trading Company, operated the automobile beyond the limits set and on a public way, has no more effect than a violation of the terms of the bailment had in <em>O\u2019Roak </em>v. <em>Lloyds Casualty Co. </em>285 Mass. 532, <em>Guzenfield </em>v. <em>Liberty Mutual Ins. Co. </em>286 Mass. 133, <em>Boudreau </em>v. <em>Maryland Casualty Co. </em>287 Mass. 423, or <em>Blair </em>v. <em>Travelers Ins. Co. </em>288 Mass. 285.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">\n<em>Decree affirmed with costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
