No direct evidence was introduced by either the plaintiff or the defendant in regard to what caused the hose to burst.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-4\">The defendant requested seven rulings which were denied. The judge found for the plaintiff and assessed damages. The defendant, being aggrieved by the denial of its requests for rulings, claimed a report. The judge reported the case to the Appellate Division, which found no prejudicial error and ordered the report dismissed. The case is before this court on the defendant\u2019s appeal from the decision of the Appellate Division,</p>\n<p id=\"b96-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>The first request, that upon all the evidence the finding should be for the defendant, was refused properly under Rule 27 of the District Courts (1932) which reads, in part: \"No review as of right shall lie to the refusal of a request for a ruling 'upon all the evidence\u2019 in a case admitting of specification of the grounds upon which such request is based unless such grounds are specified in the request, and then only upon the grounds so specified.\u201d <em>Holton </em>v. <em>American Pastry Products Corp. </em>274 Mass. 268.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">The remaining requests, in different forms, are expressed in the second request, which reads: \"On all the evidence the doctrine of <em>res ipso loquitur </em>does not apply.\u201d The case presented for decision is one where the injurious agency, at the time of the spraying of the oil upon the plaintiff\u2019s premises, was in the control of the defendant; and the only issue argued by the parties, and considered by the Appellate Division, is whether the accident was one that in the ordinary course of operating a hydraulic dump truck does not happen if those who have charge of its operation use due care. <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Colonial Air Transport, Inc. </em>278 Mass. 420, 425. <em>Washburn </em>v. <em>R. F. Owens Co. </em>252 Mass. 47, 54.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">The doctrine of <em>res ipso loquitur </em>applies where the conditions are such that a fair minded man would say that, if the instrument of injury (here the hose with its connections) had been properly examined before the accident, in all probability the accident would not have occurred. The doctrine when applicable establishes, not a <em>prima facie </em>case, but one where, in the absence of explanation, the inference of negligence from the happening of the accident is warranted. That is to say, the doctrine means nothing more than that the facts of the injury are sufficient to warrant an inference of negligence, but are not such as require the jury, or a judge sitting without a jury, to find negligence in fact. In the case at bar the hose which burst and through which the oil was sprayed on the plaintiff\u2019s premises was \u201cconstructed of rubber reinforced with wire and known as a high pressure hose,\u201d and it led from an oil pump under the cab of the motor truck to a hydraulic lifting device. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>The pump was operated by a lever whereby the motor of the truck operated the pump. The report shows that excessive speed of the motor could have no effect upon the pressure of the oil upon the hose, because the pump was so constructed and controlled by governors that the pressure of oil from the pump would remain constant. The report does not indicate that any evidence was offered that the truck or its dump body and its mechanical connection with the truck were purchased from a recognized dealer or manufacturer, as in <em>Fitzmaurice </em>v. <em>Boston, Revere Beach &amp; Lynn Railroad, </em>256 Mass. 217, or in <em>Burnham </em>v. <em>Lincoln, </em>225 Mass. 408, 409. Nor does it show that the mechanism had been recently inspected, as in <em>Lutolf </em>v. <em>United Electric Light Co. </em>184 Mass. 53, 57. A rubber hose constantly in contact with oil, often under pressure, obviously would need frequent inspection. In the absence of any explanation of the cause of the bursting of the hose, the judge could find that the circumstantial evidence of negligence, afforded by the bursting .of the rubber hose, justified a finding for the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">This case is not within the doctrine of <em>Rylands </em>v. <em>Fletcher, </em>L. R. 3 H. L. 330, <em>Ainsworth </em>v. <em>Lakin, </em>180 Mass. 397, and <em>Bratton </em>v. <em>Rudnick, </em>283 Mass. 556; and the principle of trespassing upon real estate at one\u2019s peril is not involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">Order \"Report dismissed\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b97-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
