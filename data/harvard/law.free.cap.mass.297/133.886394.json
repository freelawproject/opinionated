No return was filed by the respondents, but \u201cIt is hereby agreed and stipulated that the petition for the writ of certiorari contains the full and accurate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>record of the entire proceedings and actions of the respondents . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b170-3\">The petitioner seeks to quash the action and proceedings of the respondents in denying the appeal of the petitioner from the refusal of the licensing board of the city of Med-ford to grant to him a renewal of his license to sell alcoholic beverages as a registered pharmacist under the provisions of \u00a7 30A of G. L. c. 138, in the amended form appearing in St. 1935, c. 440, \u00a7 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-4\">The petitioner is a retail druggist who, as a registered pharmacist, is actively engaged in the business on his own account in the city of Medford. In 1936 he was the holder of a license, issued to him by the licensing authorities of the city of Medford, which permitted him to sell all alcoholic beverages in original sealed packages only, not to be drunk on the premises. The petitioner duly and seasonably applied for a renewal of the license, which was denied by the local licensing authorities, and thereupon he duly and seasonably appealed to the respondents, as provided by \u00a7 67 of G. L. c. 138, in the amended form appearing in St. 1935, c. 440, \u00a7 42. This appeal, after hearing, was denied by the respondents \"on the ground that as a matter of law the Commission cannot lawfully order the said Licensing Board to issue a license to the appellant under the said Section [said \u00a7 30A] in view of the vote taken at the biennial state election in the City of Medford on November 3, 1936. At the said election a majority of the voters voting thereon voted \u2018No\u2019 on Questions 1 and 2 and \u2018Yes\u2019 on Question 3 as appearing upon the ballot used in the said election. Questions 1, 2 and 3 were those set forth in Section 11 of Chapter 138 of the General Laws as most recently amended by Chapter 207 of the Acts of 1936.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">The petitioner contends that although the voters of said city of Medford voted \u201cNo\u201d upon the first question with relation to licenses, they voted \"Yes\u201d upon the third question with relation to licenses submitted to them upon said ballot, and that, therefore, the petitioner was entitled to have a druggist\u2019s license issued to him under the provisions of said \u00a7 30A. The petitioner states that the respondents <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>contend that, despite the fact that a majority of the voters of the city of Medford voted \u201cYes\u201d on question 3, which authorizes the issuance of licenses for the sale in the city of Medford of all alcoholic beverages in packages, so called, not to be drunk on the premises, said question 3 should be construed as permitting the issuance of licenses for the sale of all alcoholic beverages in packages, so called, to be sold only in package goods stores and not in drug stores, although under the provisions of said \u00a7 30A all alcoholic beverages are authorized to be sold by retail druggists, only in the original sealed packages, not to be drunk on the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-3\">The single issue involved in the case is whether question 3 as contained in G. L. c. 138, \u00a7 11, in the amended form appearing in St. 1936, c. 207, upon which question a majority of the voters of, the city of Medford voted \u201cYes,\u201d should be restricted in its application to package goods stores, so called, which may be licensed to sell alcoholic beverages in packages only, not to be drunk on the premises, or whether it is applicable also to retail druggists who are authorized under said \u00a7 30A, to sell alcoholic beverages in the same way, namely, in packages only, not to be drunk on the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-4\">Concerning this issue, it is the contention of the petitioner that said question 3 applies to all dealers in alcoholic beverages sold in packages not to be drunk on the premises. It is the contention of the respondents that under the provisions of said \u00a7 30A the petitioner is not entitled to a license to sell alcoholic beverages without a physician\u2019s prescription, as a registered pharmacist, unless the voters of the city in which he did business had voted in the affirmative upon the first question submitted to them upon the ballot; and that it is immaterial that they voted \u201cYes\u201d upon the third question submitted to them on the ballot in view of the fact that they had voted in the negative upon the first question.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">The respondents direct attention to the fact that said \u00a7 30A, under which the petitioner applied for his pharmacist\u2019s license, was approved on July 25, 1935; that at that time there was in existence, with relation to the granting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>of licenses to sell alcoholic beverages in cities or towns, only a statutory provision for submitting two questions to the voters of such cities or towns for determining whether licenses should be granted therein. This statutory provision was contained in \u00a7 11 of G. L. c. 138, as appearing in St. 1933, c. 376, \u00a72:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-3\">\"... <em>Section 11. </em>The state secretary shall cause to be placed on the official ballot used in the cities and towns at each biennial state election the following questions: \u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-4\">\u201c1. Shall licenses be granted in this city (or town) for the sale therein of all alcoholic beverages (whisky, rum, gin, malt beverages, wines and all other alcoholic beverages)? YES. NO.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-5\"><em>\u201c2. </em>Shall licenses be granted in this city (or town) for the sale therein of wines and malt beverages (wines and beer, ale and all other malt beverages) ? YES. NO.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-6\">\u201cThe following directions shall also be placed on said ballot immediately above the foregoing questions: \u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-7\">\u201cTo obtain a full expression of opinion, voters should vote on both of the following questions, (a) If a voter desires to permit the sale of any and all alcoholic beverages in this city (or town) he will vote \u2018 YES \u2019 on both questions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-8\">\u201c (b) If he desires to permit the sale of wines and malt beverages only herein, he will vote \u2018NO\u2019 on question 1 and \u2018YES\u2019 on question 2.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-9\">\u201c(c) If he desires to prohibit the sale of any and all alcoholic beverages herein, he will vote \u2018NO\u2019 on both questions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-10\">\u201cIf a majority of the votes cast in a city or town in answer to question one are in the affirmative, such city or town shall be taken to have authorized, for the two calendar years next succeeding, the sale in such city or town of all alcoholic beverages, subject to the provisions of this chapter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-11\">\u201cIf a majority of the votes cast in a city or town in answer to question one are not in the affirmative, but a majority thereof in answer to question two are in the affirmative, such city or town shall be taken to have authorized, for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>said calendar years, the sale therein of wines and malt beverages only, subject to the provisions of this chapter.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Arq\">Said \u00a7 30A, approved July 25, 1935, reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-3\">\u201cA registered pharmacist in a city or town wherein the granting of licenses to sell all alcoholic beverages is authorized may be licensed by the local licensing authorities to sell alcoholic beverages for medicinal, mechanical or chemical purposes without a physician\u2019s prescription subject to the limitations contained in section thirty-three, the said sales to be recorded in the manner prescribed in section thirty E. Sales of alcoholic beverages hereunder shall be made only in the original sealed packages and such beverages shall not be permitted to be drunk on the premises. Sales of such beverages by a licensee hereunder shall be permitted only during such hours as sales thereof may be made by a licensee under section fifteen. The fee for a license under this section shall be not less than fifty nor more than three hundred dollars.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b173-4\">On the above facts the respondents contend that, when \u00a7 30A regarding pharmacists\u2019 licenses in its present form was enacted, \u201cthe granting of licenses to sell all alcoholic beverages\u201d in a city could refer only to the unrestricted licenses for the sale therein of all alcoholic beverages, as set forth and described in the first question required to be placed upon the ballot by the above quoted \u00a7 11 in the form in which it existed at that time; and that the phrase, as used in said \u00a7 30A, could not conceivably have referred to or have been intended by the Legislature to relate to the granting of another and limited form of license not then required to be specifically authorized.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">In 1936, the year following the enactment of said \u00a7 30A, concerning the granting of licenses to pharmacists, the Legislature added to the provisions of \u00a7 11, as they stood in 1935, a third question which was to be voted on at biennial elections in cities and towns. This question reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-6\">\u201c3. Shall licenses be granted in this city (or town) for the sale therein of all alcoholic beverages in packages, so called, not to be drunk on the premises?\u201d TES. xo.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b174-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>This amendment, which was created by St. 1936, c. 207, and approved April 8, 1936, resulted in three questions being placed upon the ballot in the city of Medford at the biennial election, with the directions created by said amending statute with relation to the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-3\">The respondents direct attention to the fact that the Legislature, after the passage of the amendment of St. 1936, c. 207, did not further amend in any way said \u00a7 30A. On the other hand, the petitioner contends that there is nothing in question 3 which restricts the right \u201cto sell all alcoholic beverages in packages\u201d to so called package goods stores only, and that since retail druggists may only sell all alcoholic beverages in packages, not to be drunk on the premises, the language of the statute is clearly broad enough to include within its intended scope the retail druggist as well as the package goods stores, so called, or any other dealer in alcoholic beverages who is authorized under G. L. c. 138, to sell alcoholic beverages in packages.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-4\">The answer to the petitioner\u2019s argument would seem to be that, had it been the intent of the Legislature that an affirmative vote on question 3 should have the same effect with relation to pharmacists\u2019 licenses under said \u00a7 30A in 1936 as an affirmative vote upon question 1, it would have so amended \u00a7 30A in 1936 that such intent would not be disputable. We think the respondents\u2019 contention, that the fact that the Legislature did not amend \u00a7 30A in 1936 shows that the Legislature intended to leave the same dependent, as originally, upon the authorization by the city or town, through its voters, of licenses to sell \u201call alcoholic beverages\u201d as set forth in question 1, is correct. When in 1935 \u00a7 30A was enacted in its present form, licenses to sell all alcoholic beverages had a well defined, distinct and legal significance. The provisions of said \u00a7 30A are not ambiguous, and a resort to changed conditions is not permissible to ascertain or enlarge the conditions which govern the issuance of licenses to pharmacists. <em>Dunn </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Civil </em>Service, 281 Mass. 376, 382. <em>Libby </em>v. <em>New York, New Haven &amp; Hartford Railroad, </em>273 Mass. 522, 525. <em>Allen </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Corporations &amp; Taxation, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>272 Mass. 502. <em>Selectmen of Natick </em>v. <em>Boston &amp; Albany Railroad, </em>210 Mass. 229. It results that the demurrer should be sustained and the petition be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
