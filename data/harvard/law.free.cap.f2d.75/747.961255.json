He cites Standard Company of Raleigh, Inc. (unreported)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and Emigrant Ind. Savings Bank v. Scott\u2019s B. R. Co., 240 App. Div. 779, 266 N. Y. S. 27.</p>\n<p id=\"ayx-dedup-0\">Appellee contends that, upon'the trustee\u2019s deposit of money with the depository bank, which is required to give a bond, the relation of debtor and creditor is created and upon the bank\u2019s failure the trustee\u2019s claim is in no better position than that of any other depositor. He cites Lamb v. Townshend (C. C. A.) 71 F.(2d) 590, 592, and Gardner, Trustee, v. Chicago Title &amp; Trust Co., 261 U. S. 453, 43 S. Ct. 424, 67 L. Ed. 741, 29 A. L. R. 622.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-13\">We are satisfied that the District Court correctly disposed of \u2022 the case. Upon the trustee\u2019s depositing money in the bank, die relation of debtor arid creditor arose. The trustee was not entitled (save as he may be protected by a bond) to a treatment different from that shown other depositors.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-15\">In Lamb v. Townshend, supra, the court said:</p>\n<p id=\"b772-16\">\u201cThe deposit of bankruptcy funds in an authorized depository ordinarily vests the ownership of the funds in the bank and creates a mere indebtedness on the part of the bank to the trustee making the deposit. Florida Bank &amp; Trust Co. v. Union Indemnity Co. (C. C. A. 5th) 55 F.(2d) 640, 83 A. L. R. 1102; In re Bologh (D. C.) 185 F. 825, 828, 829; Gardner, Trustee, v. Chicago Title &amp; Trust Co., 261 U. S. 453, 43 S. Ct. 424, 67 L. Ed. 741, 29 A. L. R. 622; Hood, Com\u2019r of Banks, v. Brownlee (C. C. A. 4th) 62 F.(2d) 675. And the bank, does not become charged with the duties of a trustee to segregate and invest the funds because it accepts them with knowledge that they are subject to a trust. Santee Timber, Corporation v. Elliott et al. (C. C. A. 4th) 70 F.(2d) 179 [93 A. L. R. 874]; 3 R. C. L. 518; 7 C. J. 633; notes in 37 A. L. R. 120, and 53 A. L. R. 564. As said by the Supreme Court in Marine Bank <em>v. </em>Fulton County Bank, 2 Wall. 252, 256, 17 L. Ed. 785: All deposits made with bankers may. be divided into two classes, namely, those in which the bank becomes- bailee of the depositor, the title to the thing deposited remaining with the latter; and that other-kind of deposit of money peculiar to banking business, in which the depositor, for his own- convenience, parts with the title to his-money, and loans it to the banker; and the latter, in consideration of the loan of the money and the right to use it for his own profit, agrees to refund the same, amount, or any part thereof, on demand.The case before us is not of the former class. It must be of the latter.\u2019\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b772-17\">In Gardner v. Chicago Title &amp; Trust Co., supra, the court said:</p>\n<p id=\"b772-18\">\u201cWe assume that when money is deposited in ,a designated bank under section 61 of the Bankruptcy Law of July 1, 1898, c. 541,'30 Stat. 562 (11 USCA \u00a7 101), it is deposited as other money is, and becomes-the property of the bank, leaving the bank' a debtor for the amount.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b772-19\">The order is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b772-20\"> No opinion filed.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
