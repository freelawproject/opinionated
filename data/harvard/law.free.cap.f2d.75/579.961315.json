S. C. \u00a7 445, 38 USCA \u00a7 445), which provides that, \u201cNo suit on yearly renewable term insurance shall be allowed under this section unless the same shall have been brought within six years after the right accrued for which the claim is made or within one year after July 3, 1930, whichever is the later date\u201d; and \u201cthat this limitation is suspended for the period elapsing between the filing in the bureau of the claim sued upon and the denial of said claim by the director.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b603-22\">This action was commenced Aitgust 4, 1932, and was based upon the appellant\u2019s original renewable term policy, which lapsed in 1919 after his discharge from the service. The government contends that the claim for the benefits of this policy was filed June 22, 1931, that a disagreement was issued July 11, 1932, which was received by the appellant July 13, 1932, and that therefore the suit could not be maintained after July 25, 1932. The appellant contends that he first filed a claim for his term insurance on October 3, 1922, and that he next filed a claim for it on August 13, 1930. He concedes that if the documents which he asserts constitute claims for the benefits of his policy of term insurance were not claims, then his action was commenced too late. The government concedes that if the two documents which are asserted to be claims are such, the action was brought in time.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-25\">It is necessary, therefore, to determine only whether the documents referred to by the appellant as claims come within section 19 of the World War Veterans\u2019 Act of 1924, as amended (38 U. S. G, \u00a7 445, 38 USCA \u00a7 445), which provides: \u201cThe term \u2018claim\u2019 as used in this section, means any writing which alleges permanent and total disability at a time when the contract of insurance was in force, or which uses words showing an intention to claim insurance benefits and the term \u2018disagreement\u2019 means a denial of the claim by the director or some one acting in his name on an appeal to the director.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b603-26\">The first writing which the appellant says was a claim is his affidavit of October 3, 1922, which was sent to the Veterans\u2019 Bureau on or about that date. It reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AKU\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>\u201cState of Minnesota, County of Otter Tail \u2014ss.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ASz\">\u201cOn this, the 3rd day of October, A.

Army on June 14, 1918, in excellent physical condition, that he was a farmer by trade and able to do continual manual labor without undue fatigue.'</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A-f\">\u201cThat while crossing the English Channel in September he was taken very ill of influenza and upon arriving at La Havre, France, he was removed to a hospital where he remained for about two weeks and then was sent to a Convalescent Camp at La Havre for about two weeks.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A7k\">\u201cThat he was then sent to his organization but that by some mistake he became connected with another organization which was at the Front. He was still too weak for active duty but was subjected to gas. This was in the Argonne Wood. He was very ill and suffered from headache and vomiting. That he rejoined his organization in about two weeks and was relieved of all duty for two weeks.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AF8c\">\u201cDeponent swears that he has suffered intermittently from a pain in his left side of his chest ever since, that it comes and goes\u2019according to the weather and according to the amount of work he does, that he has been unable to do a full day\u2019s work since discharge and that he has not been able to do any heavy work at all and that when he attempts to do so the pain in his chest'becomes more acute and that it is also affected by damp weather. Deponent further swears that he is much inclined to cough during damp weather and that he sweats some, Deponent further swears that while at \u2022Nantes, France, while on M. P. duty he was hit in the nose by a drunken soldier and that his nose was broken and that he was in the hospital for three days. Deponent swears that his nose now seems to be'clogged on one side and that he is unable to breathe through that side and that his hearing seems to be affected.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"aqb-dedup-0\">\u201cDeponent further swears that the pain in his side became very severe in the summer of 1920, improves some but that he was .taken with severe attack of pleurisy in Oct., 1920, and consulted Dr. Esser about in January, 1921, (See Dr. Esser\u2019s statement previously sent in) and that he was unable to work because of the pain in his side before' late in April or early in May.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"aec-dedup-1\">\u201cDeponent filed a claim in the Spring of 1922 and was examined in Fargo on June 3rd. That he was told to send in a sputum specimen which he did about a week later.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"aqv-dedup-1\">\u201cDeponent further swears that late in August 1918 he developed eye trouble and that was confined to quarters for about two weeks. His eyes were inflamed and sore and the doctor kept them bandaged for about eight days. He received treatment on the boat going-over, and has had some trouble with his eyes ever since. Deponent further swears that he is very nervous and is frequently unable to sleep. Inasmuch as he has been unable to do any heavy work since his discharge because of the aforesaid dis-abilities he feels that he is entitled to compensation from date of discharge and asks tllat his case be given careful consideration.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AcL3\">[Signed] Paul J.

There is nothing m the affidavit wblcb amounts to an allegation that perma4 and total disability existed at any time when the appellant s original policy was in force. The facts stated would not justify a finding to that <em>effect. </em>Eggen v. United States (C. C. A. 8) 58 F.(2d) 616; Falbo v. United States (C. C. A. 9) 64 F.(2d) 948; United States v. Green (C. C. A. 8) 69 F.(2d) 921, <em>922, 933. </em>Therefore the affidavit 5a1nn\u00b0t be regarded as a claim for insurance benefits wltbm the statutory definition,</p>\n<p id=\"AZ7s\">The second writing which the appellant regards as a claim was an application for permanent and total disability benefits under a $3,000 government policy, No. K-839,436, which the appellant had procured June 1, 1927, by reinstating and converting $3,000 of his original $10,000 of term insurance which had lapsed. The application for the benefits under the converted policy was filed in response to the following communication <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>from the Veterans\u2019 Bureau dated August 5, 1930, and directed to the appellant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-4\">\u201cDear Sir: This Bureau has been furnished a rating made in the Regional Office at Minneapolis, Minnesota which shows that you have been rated permanently and totally disabled from March 17, 1930.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-5\">\u201cIn order to present a claim for permanent total disability insurance benefits under your U.

The application refers to it by name and number, and gives the name of the beneficiary as Hanna Josephine Stender, to whom the appellant was married September 15, 1923, and states that no change of beneficiary has been made. The original policy of term insurance was payable to the appellant\u2019s mother. There is no suggestion in the writing anywhere that the insured claims to be entitled to the benefits of his term insurance; unless that is to be inferred from the question, \u201cDate disability began,\u201d and the answer, \u201cSept. 1918.\u201d If this question and answer are equivalent to a statement that the insured claimed to have been permanently and totally disabled since that date, then the writing could be regarded as one in which the insured alleged permanent and total disability at a time when his original contract of insurance was in force.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-7\">While the contention that this writing shows that the appellant therein claimed that he was permanently and totally disabled in September, 1918, is not without some force, we think that the most that can be said for the writing is that it contains an allegation that permanent and total disability occurred while the converted policy was in force, and that such disability had its origin in September, 1918, at a time when the insured was in the service. In other words, it shows a permanent and total disability while the converted policy was in force, which disability had a service origin. But even, if the writing could be considered one which might possibly come within the broad meaning of the statutory definition of a claim, there is nothing in it which would in any way notify those receiving it that the appellant was presenting any claim for the benefits of his term insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-8\">In United States v. Peters (C. C. A. 8) 62 F.(2d) 977, 978, 979, we said with reference to a letter which it was contended constituted a claim for insurance:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-9\">\u201cSince the United States consented to be sued only in case of the existence of a disagreement, it was incumbent upon the plaintiff to allege and prove that she or some one in her behalf had written to the Veterans\u2019 Bureau, claiming that the insured, David A. Peters, had become totally and permanently disabled while his contract of insurance was still in force, or using words which showed an intention to claim insurance benefits. In addition, it was incumbent upon her to prove that her claim was denied by the Director, or by some one acting in his name, on an appeal to him. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-11\">\u201cIt seems clear that there can be no disagreement within the meaning of the statute unless the Director is given information as to who is making a claim and as to what the claim is. Unless the Director is advised that some person is claiming to be entitled to the benefits of the contract and is asserting that, while it was in force, a contingency insured against occurred, he is in no position to agree or to disagree with the claimant as to the question of liability under the contract. The letter of J. F. Peters was not a writing which alleged total and permanent disability of the insured while the insurance was in force, nor did it use words which showed an intention on the part of any one beneficially interested in the contract to claim insurance benefits under it. The letter indicated that the insured was not disabled prior to 1921. It did not state that the writer was a beneficiary or that he was representing any one who was. It did not assert or intimate that the contract had matured prior to its lapse. Furthermore, the letter of the Assistant Director did not purport to be a denial by the Director of the claim of any one for insurance benefits. It gave Mr. Peters the information he requested.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b606-12\">See, also, United States v. Collins (C. C. A. 4) 61 F.(2d) 1002; Wilson v. United States (C. C. A. 10) 70 F.(2d) 176.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-13\">We fail to see how the Director could either grant or deny a claim for the benefits of term insurance unless he was in some way notified that such a claim was being made. Had he acted upon the application for the benefits of the converted policy, as requested by the appellant on August 13, 1930, his granting or denial of the application would clearly have constituted neither the granting nor the denial of any claim for the benefits of the original term policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-14\">Our conclusion is that the court below was correct in determining that neither the affidavit of October 3, 1922, nor the appli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>cation of August 13, 1930, had the effect of tolling the statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-4\">The judgment of dismissal is therefore affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
