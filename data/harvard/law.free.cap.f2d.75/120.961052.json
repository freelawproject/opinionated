Pursuant to those acts, the state filed its claim against the receivership estate of Producers <em>&amp; </em>Refiners, Inc., Limited. The claim was allowed in the sum of $12,121.71.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-23\">The appellee state contends that it has a lien for that amount upon all the property of the Producers &amp; Refiners Company, and to the proceeds from the sale of such property in the possession of the receiver, and that by virtue of the lien it is entitled to priority over all the general unsecured creditors.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-24\">The appellant maintains (1) that the statutes above referred to are unconstitutional, and (2) that, even if the acts are constitutional, still the state is not entitled to any priority of payment because no valid lien was created by those statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>\u25a0 \u25a0 The- amount of the tax is not in dispute. When the appellant receiver rejected the claim, the court below referred the hearing of objections to a special master. The question of the validity of the acts and the priority, of any claim thereunder was submitted on briefs, without the introduction of any testim'ony.'</p>\n<p id=\"b146-4\">The special master filed his report with the court' below recommending that the Mor tor Vehicle Fuel Tax Acts were valid, and that' the state\u2019s claim was entitled to priority over all other claims in the receivership estate. The court below confirmed the report of the special master, and the present appeal resulted.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-17\">In view of the varied, grounds of attack relied upon by the appellant with regard to the legislation in question, we are transcribing in the margin, with some degree of fullness, the pertinent portions of the statutes.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b146-18\">The appellant\u2019s first assault upon the constitutionality of the acts in question is bottomed on the fact that \u201cthe flat sum of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>three cents per gallon of gasoline * * * is not in proportion to the value of said gasoline. It does not take into consideration the various qualities of gasoline, together with their corresponding deviation in value, nor does it take into consideration the fluctuations in value of gasoline, nor does it take into consideration the value of gasoline at all.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AYPS\">Article 13, \u00a7 1, of the Constitution of California provides in part: \u201cAll property-in the State except as otherwise in this Constitution provided, not exempt under the laws of the United States, shall be taxed in proportion to its value, to be ascertained as provided by law, or as hereinafter provided. The word \u2018property,\u2019 as used in this article and section, is hereby declared to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>include moneys, credits, bonds, stocks, dues, franchises, and all other matters and things, real, personal, and mixed, capable of private ownership. * * * \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\">The appellant asserts: \u201cThe right to engage in a business is a property right, and even though it may be contended that the, tax is not a tax upon the property, referring to the gasoline, it must be conceded that it is a tax upon the property, to-wit, the right to engage in the sale and distribution of gasoline.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">At the outset, it is to be observed that the legislation in question has been repeatedly held to be constitutional by the courts of California. People v. General Petroleum Corp., 204 Cal. 297, 299, 268 P. 352, 283 P. 60; People v. Sterling Refining Co., 86 Cal. App. 558, 567, 261 P. 1080. See, also, State of California v. Gillis, 69 F.(2d) 746, 748, decided by this court, and affirmed by the Supreme Court of the United States on November 5, 1934, 55 S. Ct. 4, 79 L. Ed. \u2014. In this connection, however, it should be stated that in none of those cases was there presented the precise constitutional questions that we are here considering.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">For a proper solution of the constitutional problems involved in the instant case, it is first necessary to determine the classification to which the statutes in question belong.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-7\">The title of each of the two acts (Act 2964 and Act 2965) describes the legislation as designed \u201cto regulate and license the business of producing, refining or distributing gasoline,\u201d etc. The Supreme Court of California has definitely classified these statutes as levying \u201can excise or occupation tax\u201d or a \u201clicense tax,\u201d and has declared that the title of the acts was so apt as to \u201csatisfy even the most hypercritical mind.\u201d People v. Ventura Refining Co., 204 Cal. 286, 294, 297, 268 P. 347, 283 P. 60; People v. General Petroleum Corp., supra, 204 Cal. at pages 299 and 300, 268 P. 352, 283 P. 60; People v. Richfield Oil Co., 204 Cal. 301, 304, 268 P. 353. See, also, People v. Sterling Refining Co., supra, 86 Cal. App. at pages 563, and 567, 261 P. 1080; George E. Breece Lumber Co. v. Mirabal, 34 N. M. 643, 287 P. 699, 700, 701, 84 A. L. R. 827, affirmed George E. Breece Lumber Co. v. Asplund, 283 U. S. 788, 51 S. Ct. 352, 75 L. Ed. 1415.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-8\">A license-tax is an \u201cexcise,\u201dor a \u201cprivilege\u201d or \u201coccupation\u201d tax. Within - the meaning of the constitutional provision that we are now discussing, it is not a \u201cproperty\u201d tax. The Supreme Court of California has repeatedly so held.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-10\">In City and County of San Francisco v. Pacific Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., 166 Cal. 244, 249, 135 P. 971, 974, the court said: \u201cIt is true that a license tax upon an occupation or business is not a tax upon property, even though, by constitutional or statutory definition, franchises are included in the meaning of the word \u2018property.\u2019 This is clearly decided in City of Los Angeles v. Los Angeles Independent Gas Co., 152 Cal. 765, 93 P. 1006.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b148-11\">The appellant seeks to distinguish the Los Angeles Case, cited supra, from the case at bar, on the ground \u2018that the former involved a city license tax for a flat sum, \u201cand not a tax for revenue purposes,\u201d as in the instant case. But the levying of a <em>flat sum </em>as a license tax, \u201cregardless of business done,\u201d is even less a proportioning to value than is a tax measured by the number of gallons of fuel sold. And in its statement that the tax in the Los Angeles Case was not a revenue measure, the appellant is in-error; for there the Supreme Court plainly said, at page 769 of 152 Cal., 93 P. 1006, 1007: \u201cThe tax here levied is not an exercise of the police power, but of the power of taxation. * * * \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b148-12\">The essential difference between a privilege tax and a property tax was elaborated by the state Supreme Court, in the case of Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Co. v. Roberts, 168 Cal. 420, 430, 143 P. 700, 703: \u201cThe essential difference between an ad valorem tax and any form of privilege tax is that the ad valorem tax is based upon the value of the property, tangible or intangible. <em>The privilege tax need not be based upon such value at alL </em>Privilege taxes themselves fall into two general classes: the first, a tax upon that intangible thing known as the right to conduct business; and the second, a tax upon specific personal property as a condition of the right to use it generally or for some specific purpose. * * * Thus such a tax may be imposed upon the right to conduct the business of a taxicab company, and again a tax may be imposed upon each taxicab, to be paid before that particular piece of personal property may be employed in the business. Of course, as in the case of every tax, and upon whatsoever form or kind of property it may be laid, in its essence, it is a tax upon the owner of the property.\u201d (Italics our own.)</p>\n<p id=\"b148-13\">Referring to a \u201ccorporation license tax,\u201d the Supreme Court of California has classi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>fied such a measure as a \u201cprivilege\u201d tax, saying, in the case of Kaiser Land &amp; Fruit Co. v. Curry, 155 Cal. 638, 653, 654, 103 P. 341, 347: \u201cIt is substantially the purchase price which the state has seen fit to charge for the continuance of the privilege of being and acting as a corporation. Although this privilege had already been granted to plaintiff and all other existing corporations, it had been granted subject to the power reserved by the state, to be exercised by general laws, of revocation, or the imposition of new charges therefor, or new conditions upon which it might be enjoyed. The charge is in no sense a tax <em>upon the thing granted, </em>as is the tax imposed under section 1, art. 13. It is a mere license fee charged for the privilege, and is not a tax upon property at all, and the requirements of section 1, \u00bfrt. 13, of the Constitution do not apply thereto. [Many cases cited.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b149-4\">It is worthy of note that in the foregoing case, the \u201clicense tax\u201d was \u201cproportioned to the amount of the authorized capital stock of the corporation,\u201d just as in the instant case, the amount of the \u201clicense tax\u201d is proportioned to the amount of gasoline sold. Yet in that case, the court held that the \u201clicense fee\u201d \u201cwas not a tax upon property at all.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">In 1876 when the case of City of Santa Barbara v. Stearns, 51 Cal. 499, 501, was decided, the Constitution of 1849 was in effect in California. Section 13 of article 11 of that organic law read as follows: \u201cTaxation shall be equal and uniform throughout the State. All property in this State shall be taxed in proportion to its value, to be ascertained as directed by law. * * * \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">It will thus be seen that the pertinent provision of the Constitution was substantially the same as the one in force at the present time, save that there was then no attempt to define the word \u201cproperty.\u201d With such a provision before it, the Supreme Court of the state said: \u201cA license charge or fee for the transaction of business, is in our opinion a tax within the meaning of the term \u2018tax,\u2019 as employed in those sections [not pertinent here]. It is not a tax within the meaning of section 13 of article 11 of the Constitution, but is a tax in a large sense, as being a charge or burden imposed upon persons, property or business, to raise money for public purposes. [Many cases cited.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b149-7\">See, also, 16 Cal. Jur., \u00a7\u00a7 3, 9, pp. 189, 190, 200; and 24 Cal. Jur., \u00a7 25, p. 43.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-8\">According to the jurisprudence of California, the mere fact that, as a <em>measure </em>of the amount of license tax that is to be paid, the statute designates a standard other than the <em>value </em>of the property involved, does not militate against the validity of the tax. In 16 Cal. Jur., \u00a7 32, pp. 235, 236, we find the following statement: \u201cThe license tax to be paid by those engaged in a certain business or occupation may be, and often is, made to depend on its magnitude \u2014 the receipts, sales or business transacted. * * * And, it has been stated, among the varying standards which may be adopted, it cannot be objected to as unfair or unreasonable that a distinction is based upon the number of vehicles and animals which are used in the prosecution of the business; this, as in the case of distinguishing a class by the number of persons engaged, is a method of gauging the amount of business done or the capital employed and of imposing a tax upon the occupation under such gradation. A license tax upon the operation of motor vehicles may properly be graduated according to horse-power.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b149-9\">If horse power is not an objectionable standard for the fixing of a license tax, assuredly the number of gallons of gasoline distributed by a dealer cannot be said to be a violation of the organic law.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-10\">License taxes measured by standards of volume other than value have been repeatedly upheld by the Supreme Court of California.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-11\">In San Jose v. S. J. &amp; S. C. R. R. Co., 53 Cal. 475, 476, 481, the court had before it an ordinance passed by San Jose, taxing street railroads $20 <em>on every car </em>used in the business. The ordinance was held to be a revenue measure, and was sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-12\">In Ex parte Mirande, 73 Cal. 365, 374, 375, 14 P. 888, 892, the license tax was imposed upon sheep growers, and was measured by <em>the number of sheep </em>owned by them. Declaring that the question of whether the license had been imposed for revenue or for regulatory purposes was unnecessary to discuss, because the board of supervisors \u201cpossessed authority to impose it for either or for both,\u201d the' Supreme Court dismissed a writ of habeas corpus that had been sued out by one convicted of having violated the ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-13\">The constitutionality of the Motor Vehicle Act of 1913 (St. 1913, p. 639) was upheld by the court in Matter of Application of Schuler, 167 Cal. 282, 285, 289, 290, 139 P. 685, 689, Ann. Cas. 1915C, 706. That stat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>ute provided for the registration of automobiles according to their horse power. The smallest fee was fixed at $5 for every vehicle of less than twenty horse power and the largest at $30 for every car of sixty horse power and more. The court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-4\">\u201cThe contention is made (and correctly made) that it imposes an <em>excise tax or privilege tax </em>for the purpose of providing a fund for 'roads under the dominion of the state authorities. Similar laws have been upheld in other states upon exactly that theory. In Kane v. State, 81 N. J. Law, 594, 80 A. 453 [L. R. A. 1917B, 553] Ann. Cas. 1912D, 237, a statute very much like this was under review. A resident of another state was attacking the New Jersey law which imposed the tax upon the owners of all automobiles using the public roads of New Jersey. The law was sustained.' It was conceded that under the proofs before the court <em>the statute was a revenue measure and not one passed purely in the exercise of the state\u2019s police power. There, as here, the point was made that the act was void because it sought to fix the amount of the tax arbitrarily and not in accordance with the value of the property. </em>The court, among other things, said:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-5\">\u201c \u2018The charging of an annual sum for the use of its highways by automobiles, instead of a mileage fee, is clearly a matter within the discretion of the state. No constitutional objection lies in the way of a legislative body prescribing any mode of measurement to determine the amount it will charge for the <em>privilege </em>it bestows. Home Insurance Co. v. New York, 134 U. S. 594, 10 S. Ct. 593, 33 L. Ed. 1025. The only limit upon its power is that the amount charged shall not be unreasonable; and there is no suggestion that such a condition is created by the present law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-6\">\u201c \u2018We conclude therefore that the contention of the plaintiff in error that the act of 1908 contravenes the federal Constitution, is without substance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-7\">\u201c \u2018It is further contended, on behalf of the plaintiff in error, that the imposition provided by the act of 1908 is a <em>property </em>tax, and invalid because it is imposed without regard to the value of the property upon which it is laid. What we have already said disposes of this contention. <em>The character of the imposition is not determined by the mode adopted in fixing its amount. </em>[Case cited.] The imposition is a license or privilege tax charged in the nature of compensation for the damage done to.the.roads of the state by the driving of these machines over them, and is properly based, not upon the value of the machine, but upon the amount of destruction caused by it.\u2019 [Case cited.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-9\">\u201cThe fact that an ad valorem tax is levied by local authorities upon all automobiles as property does not make this double taxation, which only occurs when the same property is taxed twice by the same government during the same period. [Many cases cited.]\u201d (Italics our own.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b150-10\">In the discussion of the three preceding decisions, we have emphasized the question of whether or not the statutes there considered were for revenue or for regulation. We have done so because the appellant earnestly contends that, because the gasoline tax acts that we now have before us are revenue measures, they \u201ccannot be construed as an inspection or license tax, constituting an exception to the provisions of said article 13, \u00a7 1, of the California Constitution.\u201d We have seen, however, that the mere revenue character of a license tax statute in no way brings it within the constitutional requirement that \u201call property in the State * * * shall be taxed in proportion to its value.\u201d See, also, City and County of Sacramento v. Crocker,. 16 Cal. 119.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-11\">The jurisprudence of California on this subject accords with general law.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-12\">In Bowman v. Continental Oil Co., 256 U. S. 642, 649, 41 S. Ct. 606, 608, 65 L. Ed. 1139, the Supreme Court of the United States had before it a New Mexico excise tax of 2 cents for each gallon of gasoline sold or used, and an annual \u25a0 license tax of $50 for each distributing station or place of business. Of the former tax, similar to the one at bar, the court said: \u201cSection 1, art. 8, of the state Constitution, invoked by plaintiff, reads: \u2018Taxes levied upon tangible property shall be in proportion to the value thereof, and.taxes shall be equal and uniform upon subjects of taxation of the same class.\u2019 Clearly the first part of this refers to property taxation. The tax imposed by the act under consideration upon the \u2018sale or use of all gasoline sold or used, in this state\u2019 is not property taxation, but in effect, as in name, an excise tax. We see no reason to doubt the power of the state to' select this commodity, as distinguished from others, in order to impose an excise tax upon its sale and use; and since the tax op-, erates impartially upon all, and with territorial uniformity throughout the state, we deem.it \u2018equal and uniform upon subjects,, of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>taxation of the same class,\u2019 within the meaning of section 1 of article 8.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">The appellant seeks to distinguish the foregoing case from the one at bar, on the ground that the New Mexico Constitution provides that taxes only upon \u201ctangible\u201d property \u201cshall be in proportion to the value thereof.\u201d But the Supreme Court laid down, the broad principle that \u201cthe tax imposed by the act * * * is not property taxation,\u201d without distinguishing between <em>tangible </em>and <em>intangible </em>property.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-7\">In Alaska Fish Co. v. Smith, 255 U. S. 44, 50, 41 S. Ct. 219, 65 L. Ed. 489, the court sustained statutes of Alaska levying \u201clicense taxes' of two dollars a barrel and two dollars a ton respectively, upon persons manufacturing fish oil, fertilizer and fish meal in whole or in part from herring.\u201d Of such legislation, Mr. Justice Holmes said: \u201cThis is not a property tax.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b151-8\">In Ohio Tax Cases, 232 U. S. 576, 592, 593, 34 S. Ct. 372, 376, 58 L. Ed. 737, the court considered a state tax on the gross intrastate earnings of railroads. The court denominated the tax an \u201cexcise or privilege tax,\u201d \u201cnot a property tax,\u201d and thus emphasized the distinction: \u201c * * * The exaction of 4 per cent of the gross intrastate earnings is not a property tax, but an excise tax, whose amount is fixed and measured by such earnings; and double taxation in a legal sense does not exist unless the double tax is levied upon the same property within the same jurisdiction. Plaintiffs in error pay one tax with respect to property, another with respect to the privilege or occupation ; hence the taxation is not double. [Cases cited.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b151-9\">See, also, State of Maine v. Grand Trunk Ry. Co., 142 U. S. 217, 228, 229, 12 S. Ct. 163, 35 L. Ed. 994; Knowlton v. Moore, 178 U. S. 41, 88, 20 S. Ct. 747, 44 L. Ed. 969; Thomas v. United States, 192 U. S. 363, 370, 24 S. Ct. 305, 48 L. Ed. 481.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-10\">This court has on more than one occasion held that a license tax, though measured in terms of property, is not a property tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-11\">In Alaska Pacific Fisheries v. Territory of Alaska, 236 F. 52, 58, 61, this court had before it an act of the territorial Legislature of Alaska (chapter 76) providing as follows: \u201cSection 1. That any person, firm or corporation prosecuting or attempting to prosecute any of the following lines of business in the Territory of Alaska shall apply for and obtain a license and pay for said license for the respective lines of business as follows: * * * 8th. Fish Traps: Fixed or floating, one hundred dollars per annum. So called dummy traps included.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b151-13\">Of such a license tax, Judge Hunt said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-14\">\u201cDoes it follow that, because the license tax imposed by the territorial Legislature is a measure <em>creating revenue, </em>it conflicts with that portion of section 9 of the Organic Act providing that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-15\">\u201c \u2018All taxes shall be uniform upon the same class of subjects and shall be levied and collected under general laws, and the assessment shall be <em>according to the actual value thereof.\u2019</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-16\">\u201cWe take it to be indisputable that the creation of revenue by the imposition of license taxes upon carrying on of business is, in a general sense, a rightful subject of legislation. But in this matter inquiry into the general question is unnecessary, for, as already pointed out, we have express transfer of authority to the territorial Legislature <em>to impose license taxes. </em>The power, therefore, being in the Legislature, <em>such taxes may be imposed without the restrictive limitations which must control in levying taxes upon property in its usual sense.\u201d </em>(Italics our own.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b151-17\">The foregoing decision was cited with approval by Mr. Justice Holmes in the Alaska Fish Co. Case, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-18\">Another territorial statute of Alaska was involved in Northern Commercial Co. v. Territory of Alaska (C. C. A. 9) 289 F. 786, 787. In that case, however, the license tax was. even more nearly like the one at bar, for there, too, the amount of the tax was proportioned, in part at least, to the <em>units </em>,and not the <em>value </em>of the merchandise involved. The Legislature of the territory (Laws 1921, c. 42) prescribed in section 1 of the act a license fee of $10 for the business of fur farming, etc., and in section 3 further provided: \u201cIn addition to the license fee above provided for the licensee shall pay to the Commissioner who issued, the license the following license fees on each pelt taken by a fur-farmer or purchased or otherwise acquired by a fur-buyer, or taken by a trapper and not sold to a licensed fur-buyer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b151-19\">Then followed a designation of the various kinds of skins dealt in by such licensees, with the amount of license tax payable upon each kind. The following language was used by the late Judge Gilbert, who delivered the opinion of the court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-20\">\u201cThe plaintiff in error contends that in levying the tax prescribed in section 3, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>Legislature imposed a tax upon each article of property handled by the fur dealer under his license, and that it is therefore an ad valorem tax on property, and void for the reason that it is not levied in accordance with the provisions of the Organic Act, section 9 of which provides that\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-4\">\u201c \u2018All taxes shall be uniform upon the same'class of subjects and shall be levied and collected under general laws and the assessment shall be according to the actual value thereof. No tax shall be levied for territorial purposes in excess of one per cent, upon the assessed valuation of the property therein in any one year.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-5\">\u201cIt is not disputed that the tax here involved is valid, if it is an excise tax, <em>as distinguished from a property tax. </em>In determining its nature, section 1 and section 3 must be construed together. Property taxes are taxes assessed on all property of a certain class in proportion to its value on a specified date. It is assessed at a stated period and collected at an appointed time. An excise tax, as the term itself indicates, is a sum <em>cut out </em>of that which is received or enjoyed by the person subjected thereto.. It includes every tax upon the privilege of performing an act or engaging in a business or occupation. Society for Savings v. Coite, 6 Wall. 594, 18 L. Ed. 897. Measured by these definitions the tax here in question is clearly an excise tax. The exaction thereof does not require the intervention of assessors or appraisers to estimate the value of the property. It does not become a property tax by reason of the fact that a certain prescribed sum is exacted upon the sale of each pelt. The fact that it establishes a schedule by which a specific sum is levied upon each article of commerce dealt in by the fur buyer does not change the nature of the tax. 26 R. C. L. 37.\u201d (Italics our own.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">The foregoing decision was cited with approval in Haavik v. Alaska Packers' Ass\u2019n, 263 U. S. 510, 513, 514, 44 S. Ct. 177, 68 L. Ed. 414.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-7\">See, also, Utah Power &amp; Light Co. v. Pfost (D. C.) 52 F.(2d) 226, 230, an Idaho three-judge case decided in this circuit; Breece Lumber Company Case, supra, 34 N.

On the contrary, he is merely asserting that \u201cin some instances\u201d the statutory requirement <em>may </em>result in \u201casking a small distributor to place a greater bond,\u201d etc. As we have seen, the undisputed amount of the tax is $12,121.71. According to report of the special master, the principal amount of the surety bond posted with the state to insure the payment of the tax in question was $6,000, less than one-half of the tax actually claimed. The appellant does not question the special master\u2019s statement in this respect.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-11\">The appellant, therefore, is in no position to attack the provisions of the statute regarding the distributor\u2019s bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-12\">In Moore v. Webb, 219 Cal. 304, 26 P.(2d) 22, 24, 89 A. L. R. 925, decided October 27, 1933, the Supreme Court of the state had before it, inter alia, section 2 of the Motor Club Service Act of 1929 (St. 1929, p. 1730), which required the deposit with the insurance commissioner of the <em>flat sum </em>of $100,000 in cash or securities approved by the commissioner, or a surety bond,' also to be approved by him, to insure faithful performance in the sale or rendering of motor club service and the payment of any fines or penalties for failure to comply with the act. A certificate to be issued by the commissioner was also required, for which an annual license fee of $10 was exacted.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-13\">It will be observed that the Motor Club Service Act requires a bond in no way graduated according to the individual motor club <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>company\u2019s ability to pay. Yet with even such a tax before it, and in answer to a contention almost identical with the one here made, the Supreme Court of California said: \u201c[The plaintiff contends] that the cash or bond deposit prescribed is excessive and that it is illegal because the requirement is imposed on all alike without any inquiry into the size of the company or the possible extent of its financial liabilities. The power to impose this requirement in a proper case is not questioned. [Cases cited.] The specific inquiry, outside of any showing that the exercise of the power is arbitrary or unreasonable, is one of economics for the Legislature and not subject to review. Central Lumber Co. v. South Dakota, 226 U. S. 157, 161, 33 S. Ct. 66, 57 L. Ed. 164. However, in passing, we note that the facts alleged in the complaint show that the deposit required does not seem to be disproportionate to the present size and the possibilities in growth of the plaintiff\u2019s membership and its possible financial liabilities. No contention is made that the deposit required, compared to the regulations to insure financial responsibility on the part of insurance companies, is disproportionate, unreasonable, or arbitrary.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">See, also, City and County of Sacramento v. Crocker, supra, and Old Homestead Bakery, Inc., v. Marsh, 75 Cal. App. 247, 252, 264-265, 242 P. 749, petition for hearing denied by the Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">Here again the doctrine in California accords with general law. In Monamotor Oil Co. v. Johnson, 292 U. S. 86, 96, 54 S. Ct. 575, 579, 78 L. Ed. 1141, decided on April 2, 1934, Mr. Justice Roberts observed that \u201cthe appellant is not in a position to complain of any alleged discrimination arising from the terms of the statute, since it has not sustained injury and none is threatened which can affect it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b153-7\">The appellant urges another ground for its charges that the tax in question is discriminatory. Pointing out that \u201cthe purpose of the tax\u201d is \u201cto maintain, repair and reconstruct highways\u201d in the state, the appellant asserts : \u201cThe classification of distributors of gasoline, therefore, is not a reasonable one, inasmuch as it casts the burden on a portion of the persons affected or benefited by the maintenance and constructions of roads. The burden should fall on the users of the highway, not upon a part only of such users. The distributors of tires; the distributors of batteries, the fuel of electric-driven cars; <em>the distributors of feed for horse-drawn vehicles, etc., </em>are not so taxed.\u201d [Italics our own.]</p>\n<p id=\"b153-9\">At least one California tribunal has already adequately disposed of a similar contention. In the Old Homestead Bakery Case, supra, at pages 264, 265 of 75 Cal. App., 242 P. 749, 755, the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-10\">\u201cNothing could be clearer than that the automatic segregation by the acts in question of the persons operating fuel gas motor vehicles employed in the transportation of passengers for hire or the transportation of property and electric motor vehicles likewise used for the purpose of fixing a tax charge peculiarly appropriate to the character of such motor vehicles with respect to the means by which they are propelled, into different classes, involves a classification founded upon an intrinsic distinction arising from the essential difference in the agencies by which such motor vehicles are operated. The classification is as well grounded as is the classification made by one of the acts herein concerned as between electric motor vehicles used in the business of transporting passengers for hire or of property and electric motor vehicles used for other purposes, of which classification counsel for petitioner, as seen, voluntarily vouchsafe their approval. Indeed, the distinction upon which the classification herein is based is no less intrinsic or natural than that which exists or would exist as between those persons conducting a trucking or a freight or passenger business by means of motor vehicles fed with fuel gas or by electricity <em>and those operating trucks or passenger stages solely by the aid of horses or mules. </em>All persons belonging to either of the classes thus established stand in precisely the same relation to the law with respect to the burdens it imposes. There is, in other words, no discrimination as between any of the persons belonging to either class. All in each class stand upon an absolute equality in so far as are concerned the duties enjoined or the burdens imposed by the law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-11\">\u201cConcluding the discussion, it is pertinent to observe that other states have adopted such a plan of classification for the imposition of a <em>privilege tax </em>upon those using the public highways by means of motor vehicles as the acts in question have established in California, and that, although attacked in the higher courts of such states upon \u2019 every conceivable constitutional ground, the plan has been upheld. Among the sister states referred to are Ohio, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, and Maryland. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>the case of Graves v. Janes, 2 Ohio App. 383, decided in February, 1914, the court, dealing with a statute which in principle makes such a classification as is involved in the acts in question here, used the following language, which is cogently pertinent in all respects to the case in hand:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-4\">\u201c \u2018The uniformity clause of the Constitution does not prevent reasonable classification of the subjects of legislation. Motor vehicles are a just subject of classification in respect to the use of public highways <em>as distinguished from horse-drawn vehicles. </em>* * * This classification deals more especially with the necessity of police regulation. The burden of highway maintenance as between motor vehicles, and horse-drawn vehicles is as clearly pronounced/ \u201d (Italics our own.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">In the foregoing decision, the court was considering the constitutionality of the Motor Vehicle Act of 1923 (St. 1923, p. 517), the purpose of which, as in the instant case, was \u201cto raise funds with which * * * highways may be improved and kept in repair in such manner as is suitable to the mode of transportation peculiar to motor vehicles.\u201d The case is therefore directly in point.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-7\">In San Francisco Shopping News Co. v. City of South San Francisco, 69 F.(2d) 879, 887, 888, certiorari denied October 22, 1934, 55 S. Ct. 122, 79 L. Ed.-, we quoted and cited a large number of decisions of the United States Supreme Court to sustain the proposition that \u201cthe great latitude allowed to the Legislature in the exercise of its police power as well as its taxing power, with respect to necessity for regulation, reasonableness of classification, and the like,, has been * * <em>* </em>frequently recognized by the Supreme Court.\u201d We need not here repeat those quotations and citations.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-11\">The appellant quotes from two decisions to support his contention that the taxing acts in question are discriminatory. The first is Ex parte Richardson, 170 Cal. 68, 148 P. 213, 214, 215, involving the validity of an ordinance entitled, \u201cImposing a license on nickel-in-the-slot machines.\u201d The Supreme Court of California found that section 2 of the ordinance, imposing a tax upon \u201csuch vendors of small articles of merchandise as use such a machine in making their sales and deliveries as is described therein,\u201d could not \u201cbe upheld as a valid enactment.\u201d' The court said: \u201cBut, and we are now speaking solely of revenue taxes, we know of no principle that warrants the imposition of a tax on <em>some </em>of those engaged in a certain business, solely because of the method they use in making their sales and deliveries, and the exemption of all engaged in <em>the very same business </em>who do not use that method.\u201d (Italics our own.)</p>\n<p id=\"b154-13\">Can it be argued that gasoline dealers and feed distributors are in \u201cthe very same business,\u201d and that the taxing acts now under consideration discriminate against the former \u201csolely because of the method they use in making their sales and deliveries\u201d? Furthermore, the court at once proceeded to distinguish the situation that it was there considering from facts such as we have here: \u201cWe are speaking, of course, of methods not involving any occupancy or use of public property, such, for instance, as the use by wagons of a public highway.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b154-14\">The other case relied upon by the appellant on the subject of discrimination is Little v. Tanner (D. C. Wash.) 208 F. 605. In that case, the court held that a statute imposing a license tax of $6,000 a year upon any merchant using trading stamps violated the equality clause of the Federal Constitution (Amendment 14), inasmuch as such a law singled out for taxation a legitimate <em>system </em>of advertising to the exclusion of other systems. The case has no pertinency to the problem we are here considering. Furthermore, counsel for neither side seem to have noticed that Little v. Tanner was reversed by the Supreme Court 240 U. S. 369, 380, 381, 36 S. Ct. 379, 60 L. Ed. 691, on precisely the point of the \u201ccharge of discrimination\u201d urged \u201cagainst the statute.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b154-15\">Accordingly, we find no unconstitutional discrimination in either of these taxing statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-16\">The final attack made by the appellant upon the constitutionality of the tatx in question is based upon the ground that it does \u201cnot afford due process of law to the parties affected thereby,\u201d in that \u201cthere is nowhere within the acts a. provision allowing the distributor a hearing on the matter of refunds or any dispute which might arise.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-17\">The text of Act 2964 does not bear out the appellant\u2019s assertion. As we have seen, the statute contains elaborate provisions for \u201ccollection of tax if delinquent,\u201d \u201cseizure of property,\u201d <em>\"notice of intended sale\" \u201csale in accordance with law \u201d </em>\u201cforfeiture of bond or deposit,\u201d \u201cproceedings if tax not paid,\u201d with citation of the distributor to appear before the state board of equalization, etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>It is fundamental law that \u201cdue process in tax matters does not mean \u201cjudicial process.\u201d In the early case of Lent v. Tillson, 72 Cal. 404, 413, 414, 14 P. 71, 74, affirmed, 140 U. S. 316, 327, 328, 11 S. Ct. 825, 35 L. Ed. 419, the Supreme Court of California said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-4\">\u201cIt has been repeatedly held that proceedings for the levy and collection of taxes are not necessarily judicial, and that due process of law, as applied to such matters, does not require such notice as is considered essential to the validity of a judgment. In Kentucky Railroad Tax Cases, 115 U. S. 331, 6 S. Ct. 571 [29 L. Ed. 414], it is said:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-5\">\u201c \u2018Notice by statute is generally the only notice given, and that has been held sufficient. \u201cIn judging what is due process of law,\u201d said Justice Bradley in Davidson v. New Orleans, 96 U. S. 97 [24 L. Ed. 616], \u201crespect must be had to the cause and object of the taking, whether under the taxing power, the power of eminent domain, or the power of assessment for local improvements, or none of these; and, if found to be suitable or admissible in the special case, it will be adjudged to be due process of law; hut if found to he arbitrary, oppressive, and unjust it may be declared to be not due process of law.\u201d \u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-6\">\u201cIn other words, the sufficiency of the notice must be determined in each case from the particular circumstances of the case in hand. And further, in matters of assessment and taxation, the same character of notice is not required as in ordinary actions in a court of justice; for the reason, I presume, that in such summary proceedings it is not practicable or usual.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b155-7\">See, also, Wulzen v. Board of Supervisors, 101 Cal. 15, 18-20, 35 P. 353, 40 Am. St. Rep. 17; In re Sutter-Butte By-Pass Assess. No. 6, 191 Cal. 650, 668, 669, 218 P. 27; 24 Cal. Jur., \u00a7 38, pages 58, 59.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-8\">This court so interpreted the phrase \u201cdue process of law\u201d with reference to taxation matters, in Nevada National Bank of San Francisco v. Dodge, 119 F. 57, 62, 63, where the following language was used:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-9\">\u201c3. The appellant also contends that the statute under which its shares were assessed is void, in that it does not provide for notice to the stockholders of the proceeding by which the assessment of their shares is to be made, and does not give to them an opportunity to be heard in relation thereto. Section 3610 of the Political Code [of California] provides that: \u25a0</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-10\">\u201c \u2018The assessor charged by law with the assessment <em>of </em>said shares shall, within ten days after he has made such assessment, give written notice to each national banking association of such assessment of the shares of its respective shareholders; and no personal or other notice to such shareholders of such assessment shall be necessary for the purpose of this act.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-11\">\u201cWe are unable to assent to the proposition that the notice thus provided for is insufficient, when considered in connection with other sections of the Political Code of the state (sections 3672-3682), which provide for a board of equalization, with power to hear complaints respecting the justice of any assessment, and also prescribe the time and place when and where such complaints may be heard. The shares of national banking associations are assessed under a general law, of which the stockholders must take notice; and the time and place when and where a stockholder may appear for the purpose of applying for a reduction of the valuation placed upon his property is fixed by a general law, of which he must also take notice. This is, we think, under all of the authorities, sufficient notice of proceedings for the assessment and taxation of property. In the language of the supreme court in Palmer v. McMahon, 133 U. S. 669, 10 S. Ct. 324, 33 L. Ed. 772:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-12\">\u201c \u2018The power to tax belongs exclusively to the legislative branch of the government; and when the law provides for a mode of confirming or contesting the charge imposed, with such notice to the person as is appropriate to the nature of the case, the assessment cannot be said to deprive the owner of his property without due process of law.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-13\">\u201cAnd in Kentucky Railroad Tax Cases, 115 U. S. 321, 6 S. Ct. 57, 29 L. Ed. 414, it was said:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-15\">\u201c \u2018It has, however, been repeatedly decided by this court that the proceedings to raise the public revenue by levying and collecting taxes are not necessarily judicial, and that \u201cdue process of law,\u201d as applied to that subject, does not imply or require the right to such notice and hearing as are considered to be essential to the validity of the proceedings and judgments of jttdicial tribunals. Notice by statute is generally the only notice given, and that has been held sufficient.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b155-16\">A study of the statutes in question convinces us that, in the matter of due process, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>they fully meet the standards laid down in the foregoing decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-4\">It might be well' to conclude our discussion of the constitutionality of these statutes, with the closing language of our opinion in the Shopping News Case, supra: \u201cIn conclusion, we desire to advert to the salutary reluctance displayed by the courts \u2014 especially, as we have seen, by the federal courts \u2014 with regard to declaring unconstitutional ah enactment of the lawmaking body of a state or of' any of its agencies or subdivisions. That reluctance we share.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">We press on. to a consideration of the appellant\u2019s final contention; namely, that \u201ceven though the acts are held to be valid and constitutional, nevertheless they do not create a lien upon the property, of the distributor, and therefore do not entitle the State to any priority over general creditors.\u201d We are assuming herein that the question of the priority of the state\u2019s tax liens over <em>antecedent liens </em>is not involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">Under this heading, the appellant\u2019s first objection is that \u201cthe lien attempted to be created is indefinite; uncertain, and contradictory,\u201d \u201cin that, in one part of said paragraph 4, it is provided that the tax shall be a lien upon all property of the distributor; while further on, in said paragraph, it is provided that the Controller shall seize any property, real or personal, used by the distributor in the operation of his business, thereby limiting the lien to property used by the distributor in the operation of his business rather than all of the property of the distributor as theretofore provided.\u201d \u201e</p>\n<p id=\"b156-8\">In other words, the appellant seems to complain that, though the lien is created upon <em>all </em>of the distributor\u2019s property, the statute provides for the enforcement of only such part of the lien as may be attached to the distributor\u2019s <em>business </em>property. We cannot see how the appellant is harmed by such a provision; for, accepting the appellant\u2019s interpretation of section 4, we find that the controller is permitted to exercise his lien upon <em>less, </em>and not <em>more, </em>of the property originally covered thereby. Furthermore, the record here contains no suggestion <em>that, </em>in the instant case, any attempt was being made improperly to subject <em>any </em>of the appellant\u2019s property to the statutory lien.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-9\">Again, the appellant objects that \u201cit further cannot be ascertained whether the property used by the distributor in the operation of his business be deemed the property as it existed at the time of the particular sale or distribution, or whether it be the property used by the distributor at the time of the seizure.\u201d Here, again, the record is absolutely silent as to there having been any change in the quantum or identity of the distributor\u2019s property since the lien attached. The appellant therefore raises a moot question; and, in the words of the Supreme Court, he \u201cis not in a position to complain.\u201d Whatever might be the ambiguities that <em>might </em>arise under the statutes, no such practical question is here presented, and none should therefore be considered.</p>\n<p id=\"AFR\">Next, the appellant asserts that \u201cone of the essential elements of a lien on personal property is that of the right of possession,\u201d but \u201cthat we have the situation of a lien without the right of possession to personal property being fixed at a time when the tax is not yet payable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b156-11\">In support of this objection, the appellant quotes from Lineker v. Ayeshford, 1 Cal. 75, 80, decided more than three-quarters of \u00e1 century before the statute in question was enacted; and from 17 Ruling Case Law, \u00a7 9, pages 601, 602.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-12\">The latter quotation, we believe, discloses the appellant\u2019s evident misconception of the nature of a statutory lien:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-13\">\u201cIt is indispensable to the existence of \u00e1 <em>common law </em>lien that the party who claims it should have an independent and exclusive possession of the property, the right to the lien being based directly upon the idea of possession. * * * \u201d (Italics our own.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b156-14\">Statutory liens do <em>not </em>depend upon possession for their validity. In Duncan v. Hawn, 104 Cal. 10, 13, 14, 37 P. 626, 627, the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-15\">\u201cThe conflict upon the subj ect has doubtless largely arisen from a failure to distinguish between common-law liens, to the existence of which possession, actual or constructive, is necessary, and those liens of purely statutory origin which had no existence at common law. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-16\">\u201cLiens which are not merely declaratory of the common law do not require possession to support them. They have the same operation without possession, and the same efficacy as common-law liens have with possession, and the assignment of the claim carries with if the right to the lien.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b156-17\">The Political Code of California specifically creates and recognizes tax liens. Section 3716 provides; <em>\"Tax Liens. </em>Every <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>tax has the effect of a judgment against the person, and every lien created by this title has the force and effect of an execution duly levied against all property of the delinquent; the judgment is not satisfied nor the lien removed until the taxes are paid or the property sold for the payment thereof. * * * \u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-4\">Section 3717 reads as follows: <em>\u201cTax on Personal Property a Lien on Real Property. </em>Every tax due upon personal property is a lien upon the real property of the owner thereof, from and after twelve o\u2019clock m. of the first Monday in March in each year.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">And section 3718:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-6\"><em>\u201cLiens of Taxes on Real Property and Taxes on Improvements. </em>Every tax due upon real property is a lien against the property assessed; and every tax due upon improvements upon real estate assessed to others than the owner of the real estate, is a lien upon the land and improvements; and the taxes on all assessments of possession of, claim to, or right to the possession of land, and the taxes on taxable improvements located upon land exempt from taxation, arc respectively liens upon such taxable real property, if any, as the owner or claimant of such possession of, claim to or right to possession, or improvements, owns in the county in which such possession, claim to, or right to possession of land, or taxable improvements are situated; which several liens attach as of the first Monday of March in each year.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b157-7\">Section 3785b of the same compilation declares that the provisions of sections 3786 and 3787 of the Code shall be made applicable to the deed provided for in section 3785b; namely, a deed \u201cto a purchaser other than the state of California at a delinquent tax sale.\u201d Section 3787 reads as follows: <em>\u201cEffect of Deed to State. </em>Such deed, duly acknowledged or proved, is (except as against actual fraud) conclusive evidence of the regularity of all other proceedings, from the assessment of the assessor, inclusive, up to the execution of the deed. Such deed conveys to the state the absolute title to the property described therein, free of all encumbrances, except any lien for taxes levied for municipal * * * purposes,\u201d etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-8\">Having before it Code provisions similar to. those now found in sections 3716, 3717, 3785b, and 3787, the Supreme Court of California, in the case of California Loan Co. v. Weis, 118 Cal. 489, 494, 50 P. 697, 699, said: \u201cNo distinction is made by these laws between the lien which exists upon the land for the tax on personalty and the lien which exists for the tax upon the land itself. \u2018Every lien\u2019 created by this title remains until the taxes are paid or the property sold. The title which the purchaser gets under the enforcement of any tax lien by sale is free from all incumbrances. \u2018A lien for taxes does not stand upon the footing of an ordinary incumbrance, and is not displaced by a sale under a pre-existing judgment or decree, unless otherwise directed by statute. It attaches to the res, without regard to identical ownership, and when it is enforced by sale pursuant to statute the purchaser takes a valid and unimpeachable title.\u2019 Os-terberg v. Union Trust Co., 93 U. S. 424 [23 L. Ed. 964]. The mandate of our statutes puts all tax liens upon the same plane, <em>makes them all paramount to other liens, and, under sale for their enforcement, gives to the purchaser a title free and unincumbered.\" </em>(Italics our own.)</p>\n<p id=\"b157-10\">Furthermore, as the appellee points out, \u201cthe State of California, by its adoption of the common law, has succeeded to the prerogative right of the British Crown to priority in payment for taxes out of the assets of insolvent debtors, as against all persons not having antecedent liens.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-11\">Section 4468 of the Political Code provides : <em>\u201cCommon Law When Rule of Decision. </em>The common law of England, so far as it is not repugnant to or inconsistent with the constitution of the United States, or the constitution or laws of this state, is the rule of decision in all the courts of this state.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b157-12\">Marshall v. New York, 254 U. S. 380, 382-385, 41 S. Ct. 143, 144, 65 L. Ed. 315, involved, not a franchise tax, as contended by the appellant herein, but \u201clicense fees or taxes for the privilege of doing business within the state.\u201d The propriety of allowing to the state a preference as to amounts due for the annual <em>franchise </em>taxes, also owned by the corporation, was admitted by the receiver in that case. The lien for <em>license </em>taxes alone was in question. The Supreme Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-13\">\u201cThe single question is presented whether the state of New York has priority in payment out of the general assets of the debtor over other creditors whose claims are not secured by act of the parties nor accorded a preference, by reason of their nature, by the state Legislature or otherwise.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-14\">\u201cAt common law the crown of Great Britain, by virtue of a prerogative right, had priority over all subjects for the payment out of a debtor\u2019s property of all debts due <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>it. The priority was effective alike whether the property remained in the hands of the debtor, or had been placed in the possession of a third person, or was in custodia legis. The priority could be defeated or postponed only through the passing of title to the debt-tor\u2019s property, absolutely or by way of lien,before the sovereign sought to enforce his right. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-4\">\u201cThis priority arose and exists independently of any statute. The Legislature has never, in terms, -limited its scope; and the courts have rejected as unsound every contention made that some statute before them for construction had, by implication, effected a repeal or abridgment of the priority. The only changes of the right made by statute have been by way of enlarging its scope in certain cases. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-5\">\u201cThe priority of the state extends to all property of the debtor within its borders, whether the debtor be a resident or nonresident and whether the property be in his possession of in custodia legis. The priority is therefore enforceable against the property in the hands of a receiver appointed by a federal court within the state.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">The appellant seeks to distinguish the Marshall decision from the case at bar, on the ground that \u201cthe State of California has not adopted that rule [that \u2018claims of the state and taxes are preferred as to payment\u2019] but, on the contrary, the law is and the courts of this state have, contrary to the courts of New York state repeatedly, consistently and uniformly held that every levy of tax is in invitum,\u201d etc. A study of the California statutes and of the California Loan Case, supra, however, will convince one that the appellant is in error, and that the law of California clearly recognizes the priority of the state\u2019s liens for taxes.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-7\">See, also, Chase v. Trout, 146 Cal. 350, 365, 80 P. 81 (street assessment lien\u2019s priority over <em>antecedent liens </em>of a private nature) ; Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. v. Johnson Shipyards Corp. (C. C. A. 2) 6 F.(2d) 752, 754, 756-758, affirmed Stripe v. United States, 269 U. S. 503, 46 S. Ct. 182, 70 L. Ed. 379.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-8\">The appellant seeks to weaken the authority of the Liberty Mutual Insurance Case, supra, by quoting a. passage therefrom to the effect that \u201cthe right of the <em>United States </em>to priority in the payment of <em>debts </em>depends exclusively upon <em>statute.\u201d </em>(Italics our own.) But the appellant omits no doubt, inadvertently, the following significant passages from the opinion, which at once bring it within the situation with which we are now dealing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-10\">\u201cIt has frequently been pointed out that a tax lawfully imposed is not to be regarded as an ordinary <em>debt, </em>but is an obligation which is to be regarded as paramount to all other demands, although the law imposing the tax does not expressly provide that it is to have priority. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-11\">\u201cThe courts have sustained in numerous cases the right to priority of payment of taxes over all other claims. [Many cases cited.] But these cases relate to the right of a <em>state </em>to priority of payment of a <em>state tax, </em>which is to be distinguished from the right of the United States to a similar priority, possibly in the fact that <em>the states have a common law </em>while it has often been said by the Supreme Court that the United States has no common law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-12\">\u201cHowever, instances are numerous in which the common-law prerogatives of the sovereign have been held applicable to the United States in its sovereign capacity. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-13\">\u201cAnd we think that, <em>independently of any specific statutory provision, the United States in its capacity as a sovereign is entitled to a priority in the payment of taxes over unsecured creditors; such priority being possessed by it as a prerogative right.\u201d </em>(Italics our own.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b158-14\">Thus it will be seen that, in the foregoing case, the court distinguished between ordinary debts and taxes, and held that not only the states, but the United States,- was entitled to priority in the payment of taxes over unsecured creditors, such priority being possessed by it as a prerogative right. The case is therefore clearly authority here, where the prerogative, not of the United States, but of a state, is involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-15\">To recapitulate, we find that the taxing statutes in question violate neither the Federal nor the State Constitution; that they have created valid liens in favor of the ap-pellee; and that such liens are entitled to priority over the claims of the general unsecured creditors of the receivership estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-16\">Accordingly, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"AUE\"> Act 2964, printed under title 220, \u201cGasoline,\u201d 1 Deering\u2019s General Laws of California, 1931, pages 1425-1439, contains, the following provisions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-8\">\u201cAct 2964 \u2014 An act to regulate' and license .the business of producing, refining \u2022or distributing gasoline,\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AbH\">\u201c\u00a7 2. <em>Distributors\u2019 License.
