A jury having been waived, the court found him guilty as charged in each count of the indictment. The charges, aside from the conspiracy count, deal with the passing of counterfeit obligations of the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-21\">We have examined the evidence and conclude that it is sufficient to support a conviction, but it persuasively points to appellant\u2019s guilty participation in the offenses charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-22\">A codefendant, Tomczak, pleaded guilty. The passing of the counterfeit $10 bills in different saloons by appellant\u2019s friends while he remained outside and joined them after their successful efforts in two saloons, their subsequent arrest and his flight from the scene, the unexplained disappearance of the money which his associates obtained when the counterfeit $10 bills were cashed, the falsehoods told by him upon his return to his room the same night\u2014all tend to sustain the charges and necessitate an affirmance of the finding of the trial judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-23\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
