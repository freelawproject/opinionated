Appeal was duly taken to the Board of Appeals, and on June 21, 1934, the- latter tribunal affirmed the action of the Examiner.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-25\">Thereafter appeal was taken to this court and a. certified transcript of the record was duly filed with the clerk of. the court on September 21, 1934. On October 20, 1934, for satisfactory reasons, the court granted a motion of appellant, for a sixty-day extension of .time for printing the record. Later, the court, of its own-motion, entered an order giving an addir tional extension. .</p>\n<p id=\"b227-26\">On November 12, 1934, a petition was filed on behalf of appellant, seeking a remand and return of the cause \u201cand \u00a1the transcript of record filed herein\u201d to the United States Patent Office, At the* end of this petition there was a \u201cjoinder\u201d on the part of the Commissioner of Patents, the same being signed by the Solicitor for the Patent Office. We here quote the texts of the petition and \u201cjoinder\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-27\">\"Petition to Remand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-28\">\u201cTo the Honorable, the Judges of said court:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-29\">' \u201cYour petitioner, George A. Robert-shaw, appellant in the above-entitled case, respectfully represents that: '</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-30\">\u201c1. The application for Letters Patent involved in this appeal was drily, filed in the United States Patent Office ,on\u2018 September 17, 1.926 and was thereafter duly prosecuted before the Primary Examiner in revision 39. After prosecuting this case before the Primary Examiner from Septermber 17, 1926 until July 24, 1933, this application was finally rejected by-the Primary Examiner on the latter date; Thereafter on. January 20, 1934 an appeal was du.ly taken to the Board of Appeals of the-United States Patent Office which, on June 21, 1934, denied applicant\u2019s request for a patent and affirmed the action of the Pri-, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>mary Examiner. Thereafter this appeal to this Honorable Court was duly taken, which appeal is now pending before it and remains unheard by said Court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-4\">\u201c2. On September 25, 1934, United States Letters Patent No. 1,974,975 were issued by' the United States Patent Office to Louis Stein and Walter C. Peters on an application therefor filed September 30, 1932. This patent relates to exactly the same subject matter as the application involved in this appeal; both applicants were claiming exactly the same subject matter; and the applications were copending in the Patent Office. \u25a0 An interference should have been but was not declared by the Patent Office between these two applications during their pendency in the Patent Office.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-5\">\u201c3. Since the. discovery by petitioner of this error on the part of the United States Patent Office, appropriate steps have been taken by the petitioner in order to obtain an adjudication of the question of priority as between petitioner and the patentees of the aforesaid patent. On November 7,1934, the United States Patent Office in accordance with the statutes and rules in such cases made and provided, declared an interference between petitioner\u2019s application Serial No. 136,039, the application involved in this appeal to this court, and said Stein et al. patent No: 1,974,975, said interference being identified as No. 69,678. A correct copy of the declaration of the aforesaid interference' is attached hereto and marked \u2018Exhibit A.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-6\">\u201c4. It is essential that this cause and the transcript of record filed herein be remanded and returned to. the United States Patent Office to.the end that full and appropriate proceedings may be had in the United States Patent. Office in accordance with the statutes and rules in such cases made and provided. As appears from paragraphs 2 and 3 of page 2 pf \u2018Exhibit A\u2019 attache^ hereto consideration de novo will be given this application including the claims now pending before this Court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-7\">\u201cWherefor your petitioner prays that this cause.,and the transcript of record filed herein be remanded and returned to the United States Patent Office for further proceedings in accordance with. the statutes and rules in such cases made and provided.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-8\">\u201cJoinder.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-9\">\u201cThe Commissioner of Patents hereby joins in the foregoing petition to remand and return this cause and the transcript of record therein to the United States Patent Office for further proceedings.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b228-11\">Affidavit in support of the petition was made by one of the attorneys for appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-12\">It is noted from the transcript of record, filed in the .appeal to this court, that appellant gave the notice of appeal to the Commissioner of Patents on August 7, 1934, and, in a brief in support of the petition to remand, the statement is made that the decision of the Board of Appeals sustaining the right of' Stein and Peters to patent was rendered on that same day. The patent in fact issued under date of September 25, 1934, according to the petition. The petition does not state the date upon which notice of the patent was first brought to appellant\u2019s attention, but it does allege that \u201cthis patent relates to exactly the same subject-matter\u201d as appellant\u2019s application; that since the application of appellant and that of Stein and Peters were copending, an interference should have been declared; and that, following discovery of this situation, appellant took appropriate steps \u201cto obtain an adjudication of the question of priority\u201d between the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-13\">The exact nature of the steps taken is not revealed by the record, but apparently the procedure comprised, at least in part, the copying of two claims from the patent into appellant\u2019s application and requesting an interference. These were claims 1 and 2 of the patent and they became claims numbered 38 and 39, respectively, in appellant\u2019s application. The interference so sought was declared, apparently, on November 7, 1934.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-14\">As Exhibit A to the petition for remand, there was filed what purports to be a copy of the interference so declared. It sets forth two counts numbered 1 and 2, respectively, they being in the identical language of claims 1 and 2 of the patent. .</p>\n<p id=\"b228-15\">These two counts, however, are not in th'e specific language of any of the claims involved' in the appeal and no one of the appealed claims is embraced in the interference. It should be s.aid that the appeal involves only three claims. These are numbered 33, 34, and 35, respectively. At one period during the prosecution of the case in the Patent Office two other claims numbered 36 and 37, respectively, apparently were presented, but these had been, in some way, eliminated prior to the final decision of the Examiner.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>For the purposes of the question now before us, it will be assumed by us that the procedure above related was in conformity with the Patent Office practice, and that, although the appeal to this court as to certain claims had been taken, the application of appellant still remained in the Patent Office in such position as that he was entitled to proceed as he did proceed.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-4\">We deem it of importance to note just here that the petition for remand does not set forth the taking of any action by appellant, in the Patent Office itself, looking toward a <em>reconsideration </em>by the tribunals -of that office of the claims involved in the appeal. It may be assumed that it was the view of appellant that since the appeal to this court had been perfected, before he had any notice of the patent, nothing further concerning the appealed claims could be done in the Patent Office, unless they were remanded without any decision upon the merits by this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">However this may be, it is sufficient \u25a0at this point to say that the only specific action sought of the Patent Office (other than possibly the securing of the joinder by the Commissioner in the petition for remand) was the declaration of the interference which did not relate specifically to the appealed claims, and this action was taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">In view of the apparent novelty of the question presented by the petition for remand, this court requested counsel for petitioner to furnish brief with any authorities available \u201cin support of the right of the court to remand without a reversal, affirmance, or modification\u201d of the decision \u25a0of the Board of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">Counsel has favored us by so doing. The only authority cited which relates specifically to procedure in appeals to the courts from decisions of the tribunals of the Patent Office is the case of Podlesak v. McInnerney, 26 App. D. C. 399, 1906 C. D. 558. The Solicitor for the Patent Office appended a statement to the brief supplied \"'by attorneys for petitioner, in which he stated his agreement therewith, \u201cparticularly in view of\u201d the said Podlesak Case, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-8\">We note that while in the said case, the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia, obviously upon its own motion, did remand the cause (an interference proceeding) for certain specific reasons without a formal declaration of reversal, nevertheless si stated in the body of the opinion: \u201c * * * We consider that an error has been committed in this case. * * * \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b229-10\">It is our view that while the Podlesak Case, supra, constitutes a precedent for remanding a case to the Patent Office, under certain circumstances, without any formal reversal, affirmation, or modification of the decision on appeal, the facts of the instant case do not justify the application of the rule there followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-11\">It may be pointed out that this court, in the case of In re Benjamin Greenfield, 40 F.(2d) 775, 17 C. C. P. A. (Patents) 1217, of its own motion, remanded certain claims for consideration de novo, but there was an express reversal of the decision of the Board of Appeals as to such claims for reasons specifically pointed out in our opinion. The course followed in the Green-j field Case, supra, has no applicability here.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-12\">The brief on behalf of petitioner presents the view that there is an analogy between the situation here and that respecting cases wherein a hearing has been had before a United States District Court and a final decree entered and an appeal to the Circuit Court of Appeals, and during the pend-ency of the appeal, and before determination thereof, a rehearing or review is desired \u201cbecause of some error of law apparent on the face of the record or because of new matter or newly discovered evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b229-13\">Specifically, the brief says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-14\">\u201cThe present case is more closely analogous to those cases wherein a rehearing is desired before the District Court while the appeal to the Circuit Court of Appeals is still pending but remains undecided, for [because] the request for a declaration of the interference between appellant\u2019s application and the Stein et al. patent is akin to a petition for rehearing based on new matter or error of law apparent on the face of the record. The decision of the Board of Appeals of the' Patent Office denying appellant\u2019s right to a patent was rendered on June 21, 1934 and this decision could not be said to be final so as to be not subject to rehearing until after the expiration of six months from June 21, 1934.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b229-15\">In illustration of the practice in United States District and Appellate- Courts, there are cited numerous authorities, including the cases of Roemer v. Simon et al., 91 U. S. 149, 150, 23 L. Ed. 267, recently approved by the Supreme Court in Realty Acceptance Corp. v. Montgomery, 284 U. S. 547, 551, 52 S. Ct. 215, 76 L. Ed. 476; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>Cimiotti Unhairing Co. v. American Unhairing Mach. Co. and Cimiotti Unhairing Mach. Co. v. Mischke (C. C. A.) 99 F. 1003.

Lipp, 28 F.(2d) 863 (C. C. A. 9) and Jensen et al. v. New York Life Ins. Co., 50 F.(2d) 512 (C. C. A. 8).</p>\n<p id=\"Ai5\">The. foregoing list of authorities is here given because of pur thought that the question present\u00e9d is one which may be of moment to ail those interested in patent prcn cedur'e. It is not necessary here to review the'cases m detail,' nor toq\u00fcot\u00e9 elaborately from the opinions. The principle announced in tliedeading case,-that of Roemer v. Simon et al., supra, and as stated, recently reaffirmed! by the Supreme Court in the Realty Acceptance Corp. Case, supra, has been consistehtly followed practically without modification in all the subsequent\u2019cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"Ap7\">In the Roemer v. Simon et al. Case, suprh, the situation was that a final decree had been rendered (in 1874) by the United States Circuit Court for the District of New Jersey, dismissing the bill of complaint and an appeal taken tp the Supreme Court During the pendency of this appeal there was presented bn <em>behalf of appellant </em>a petition and affidavit stating in substance that new and material evidence previously unknown to him, had been discovered after the appeal, and motion was made, that leave be granted the appellant to give appellees the requisite notice of a further motion for a rule requiring them to show cause why the Supreme Court should not remit the record to the court below for a rehearing of the cause.</p>\n<p id=\"AUh\">In denying the motion, Mr. Chief Justice Waite said:</p>\n<p id=\"AVq\">\u201cIt is clear that, after an appeal in equity to this court, we cannot, Upon motion, set aside a decree, of the court; below, and grant a rehearing. We can only affirm, reverse, or modify the decree appealed from and that upon the hearing of the cause. No new evidence can be received here. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 698. . The court below cannot grant a rehearing after, the term at which the final decree was rendered. Equity Rule, 88. It would be useless to remand this cause, therefore, as the term at which the decree was rendered has passed. If the term still continued, the proper practice \u25a0 would be to make application to the court below for a rehearing, and have that court send to us a request for a \u2022 return of the record, in order that it might proceed further with the cause. Should such a request be made, we might, in a proper case and under proper restrictions, make the necessary order; but we cannot make such an order on the application of the parties. The court below alone can make the request of us. The application of the parties must be addressed to. that court, and not-to us.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b230-9\">Assuming, without deciding, that there is such an analogy between the procedure with .respect to patents, where matters are appealed to this court; and the- procedure in the. District and Appellate Courts- of the United States,. :as that the practice in. the latter may be and. should be applied in the former) it seems proper to point out that the practice stated to be proper in the Roemer v. Simon Case, .supra, was not followed by appell\u00e1nt here.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-10\">Appellant here comes directly to this court (which, except where procedure is had under section 4.915, Revised Statutes, as amended [35 USCA \u00a7 63], is, under the authorities, the tribunal of- final jurisdiction over appeals from the - Patent- Office) with a petition for remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-11\">\u25a0'\u25a0It would seem that his course should have been to make the proper application to the proper tribunal of the Patent Office (and we do not undertake here to say which would be the proper' tribunal) and have that tribunal alone send to us a request for a return of the record with such a statement of reasons for the request as were pertinent and proper. \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b230-12\">We do not overlook the fact that the Commissioner of Patents joined in appellant\u2019s petition ' in the manner already set forth, b'ut neither may w\u00e9 overlook the further fact that there is no statement by the Commissioner which concedes error Of Ci-ther law' or fact) or even states any belief that error may have been committed. We db not' find any statement <em>by the Commissioner </em>indicating any desire or purpose that the appealed claims shall -be reconsidered by the tribunals of the Patent Office.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-13\">It- is true that the copy of the Declaration pf Interference, filed as Exhibit .A to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>the petition, contains the following statements :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-4\">\u201cAfter termination of the interference this application will be held for restriction and revision under Rule 96.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-5\">\u201cClaims 33 to 37 will be held subject to rejection as unpatentable over the issue in the event of an award of priority adverse to applicant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">And that, alluding to the foregoing statements, the petition says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-7\">\u201cAs appears from paragraphs 2 and 3 of page 2 of \u2018Exhibit A\u2019 attached hereto consideration de novo will be given this application including the claims now pending before this Court.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b231-8\">Except for whatever implication might arise from the joinder by the Commissioner in a petition containing such averment, we are unable to concur in the suggestion that such is the purpose. We do not de-, duce from the quoted statements themselves that there is any purpose of reconsidera^ tion by the tribunals of, the Patent Office; of the appealed claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-9\">The normal construction of the statements, it seems to us, -is that the application, with only such of i-tS' claims as are now in the Patent Office,- wili be held for' revision, and that the appealed claims, now standing rejected-upon prior art, \u2018eventually will be also subject-to -rejection as unpatentable over the interference issue, should priority be awarded adverse\u2019 to appellant. In other words, even if this court should reverse the decision of the Board of Appeals in the ex parte case, and hold the claims patentable over the cited art, they still will be subject to rejection over the issue of the interference should appellant lose on the issue of priority. However, should appellant be awarded priority in the interference proceeding and should this court in a hearing upon \u2019the merits hold the appealed claims patentable, appellant presumably will then receive patent both upon those claims which are in interference and those upon appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-10\">In any event, we are unable to construe the petition obviously prepared wholly by a party \u2014 indeed the only party, since it is an ex parte case \u2014 and merely joined in by the Commissioner, as constituting a request, such as brings the case within the rule of \u201cproper practice\u201d announced by the court in the Roemer v. Simon Case, supra. Under the rule of that case (still assuming, without holding, that it is applicable in patent practice), \u201cwe cannot'make such an order [of remand] on the application of the <em>parties. </em>The court [here the proper tribunal of the Patent Office] below alone can make the request of us.\u201d (Italics ours.)</p>\n<p id=\"b231-12\">It may be further observed that it is not seen how appellant\u2019s legal rights are in anywise jeopardized by a declination to remand the case, nor indeed how they would be promoted or protected by such remand. The case is before us ex parte and may be heard and disposed of upon its merits without prejudice to the interference proceeding and the Commissioner of Patents makes no statement as to either facts or law indicating that determination of the interference proceeding is\u2019 in anywise dependent upon having the appealed claims returned,, or that they might \u2019be placed in the in-' terference if returned. \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b231-13\">In the cases of In re McPherson, 64 F.(2d) 364, 20 C. C. P. A. (Patents) 1022, and In re Schaeffer, 65 F.(2d) 474, 20 C. C. P. A. (Patents) 1208, we held that, even assuming, without,,deciding, our authority to remand, the reasons then presented did. not justify such a course. The same is true here, but becaus'e'the matter has been'here presented in. a new and more formal way, \u2019 wte'have felt Constrained to discuss-certain phases of the question at greater length than at any time heretofore.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-14\">The petition for remand is denied;</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
