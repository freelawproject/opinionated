The only contention we need to consider is that the first count was fatally defective because it failed to allege ah intent to defraud the United States or any named individual.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-24\">As regards- intent, the indictment is in the language of the statute, 26 USCA \u00a7 273, under which it. was drawn. That statute, like those designed to punish offenses against the currency, 18 USCA \u00a7\u00a7 262, 265, 267, 270, 271, 272, uses the comprehensive term \u201cwith intent to defraud\u201d for the very purpose of making it immaterial whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"825\">*825</page-number>the offender intended to defraud the government or some particular individual. One engaged in counterfeiting and kindred crimes may not, and probably does not usually, know who may be the victim of his fraudulent scheme; his real intention is that the forged instrument shall be accepted as genuine. A prosecutor cannot possibly know more about the intent of the possessor of counterfeit stamps than such possessor himself knows. The intent to defraud may therefore, in cases like this, be averred in general terms. Evans v. United States, 153 U. S. 584, 594, 14 S. Ct. 934, 38 L. Ed. 830; United States v. Sacks, 257 U.
