C. A.) 75 F.(2d) 256, except that long before the proceeding was started the debtor had here conveyed away its interest in the mortgaged property. By these conveyances it had stripped itself of all its property except for a somewhat dubious residue in some bank accounts, amounting at most to a few thousand dollars. We have held that a substantial equity is not necessary to justify the proceeding. We see no reason to stick at a phantom equity whose value is a mere visionary possibility. The debtor is itself made up of its shareholders, considered as a class, and, just as they are bound together by the corporate form, so are the secured creditors by their <em>common </em>trust. Indeed, the shareholders, the unsecured creditors, and the secured, are each a separate order in one hierarchy; each has its proper unity; the section is intended as a remedy to allow all or some of these classes to establish a concourse which will avoid that dismemberment of their interests which other remedies occasion. Thus it can 'make no difference that the group of shareholders has been definitely eliminated, either by a legal transaction as here, or by such a collapse in value that there is no reasonable expectation of revival.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-10\">Order affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
