C. P. A. (Patents) 1041; In re Dann, 47 F.(2d) 356,18 C. C. P. A. (Patents) 1031; Ex parte Conrad, 388 O. G. 525; Ex parte McCullough, 355 O. G. 185, 1927 C. D. 12. That ground of rejection was not reversed by the Board of Appeals, and is, therefore, before us for consideration. In re Wagenhorst, 64 F.(2d) 780, 20 C. C. P. A. (Patents) 991.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-25\">In the case of In re Leroy J. Buttolph, Patent Appeal No. 3116, decided December 24, 1934, 73 F.(2d) 936, 22 C. C. P. A. (Pat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>ents)-, this court affirmed the decision of the Board of Appeals holding that appellant did not disclose in his original application, of which the application in the case'at bar is a division, a \u201cdischarge tube for positive column light,\u201d and that, therefore, he was not entitled to claim a device of that character.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">Claims 51, 52, 53, 54, and 64, of which claim 51 is illustrative, relate either to discharge tubes for \u201cpositive column light,\u201d or to a process for operating such tubes. We are in accord with the board\u2019s rejection of those claims on the ground that appellant did not disclose the subject-matter defined therein in his original application. In re Buttolph, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-6\">Claims 23, 24, 25, 61, 62, 63, 65, and 67 contain the specific limitation, substantially as stated in claim 24 hereinbefore quoted, an \u201celongated tubular envelope, the length of said envelope being materially greater than its diameter, in a minimum ratio, of approximately five to one.\u201d In addition to other grounds of rej ection, those claims, except claim 25, were rejected by the Board of Appeals because of failure to disclose in appellant\u2019s original application those dimensions, which it is contended vitalize those claims and make them patentable. This issue has been fully discussed in the decision of the Primary Examiner, and his conclusions concurred in by the Board of Appeals; the board stating that such limitations were based entirely, and without justification, upon a \u201cdiagrammatic disclosure.\u201d The conclusion reached by the tribunals of the Patent Office relative to those claims is so obviously correct that we deem it unnecessary to enter upon a discussion of the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-7\">Claim 2 was rejected by the Board of Appeals on the patent to Skaupy, in view of the patent to Lederer. That claim contains the statement \u201can alternating current arc lamp for commercial circuits,\u201d and it is contended by counsel for appellant that the patent to\u2018Skaupy, hereinafter referred to, relates to a high voltage device; whereas appellant\u2019s lamp is of the low voltage type; and that, therefore, the patent to Skaupy is not a proper reference. It is a sufficient answer to appellant\u2019s contention to say that the claim is not limited to a \u201clow voltage\u201d device. It is limited, however, to \u201cmeans co-operating with said filamentary terminals for maintaining the said gas or vapor in a conducting state over, the zero points in the alternating current source.\u201d With reference to that limitation, the board stated that the patentee Skaupy obtained the same result \u201cby use of thick tungsten spirals and possibly also by the use of a rare gas. He states as one characteristic of his lamp that the ionization may exceed in duration the time from one-half wave to another. It seems obvious that this must have depended on some such expedient as above referred to, and incidentally also upon the use of alkaline metal although perhaps not recognized by the patentee.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b655-9\">In view of the fact that the Board of Appeals has concisely stated the teachings of the patents to Skaupy and Lederer, we deem it sufficient to quote from its decision relative thereto:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-10\">\u201cSkaupy contemplates utilizing a gaseous filling for his tube and states that with rare gas the danger occasioned by the use of high voltages is reduced; in other words, this is a disclosure of the second of appellant\u2019s means for facilitating easy starting, the first .being the heated cathodes which correspond in all .respects with those of Skaupy. Skaupy also proposes to use in his tube small quantities of alkaline metals. While these are not introduced for appellant\u2019s particular purpose, it is the examiner\u2019s view that they would inherently serve as emitters of electrons and would accordingly lower the starting resistance of the Skaupy tube. From the Lederer patent cited it appears that \u2018traces of these metals or alloys are sufficient.\u2019 Such being the case, we think the alkaline metals -employed by Skaupy would inherently function in the manner of the corresponding metals used by applicant. Skaupy is not particularly definite as to the location of these metals, they being placed, according to the translation, in the path of the discharge. .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-11\">\u201cLederer uses the same metals for substantially the same purpose and so introduces them that a deposit will be formed on the wall of the tube in the region of the anode and possible also along the anode itself. Any. deficiencies in the Skaupy disclosure with respect to mixtures of gases or the location of metallic emitters is in our opinion s\u00fapplied by the Lederer patent. Lederer, like appellant, was interested in reducing the necessary potential across the electrodes. He brought about this reduction of potential.by using certain of appellant\u2019s expedients, viz., the use of a gas or mixture of gases and the use of an emitting alkali metal.\u201d ..</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AtRG\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>Claim 55 was rejected by the Board of Appeals on the patent to Skaupy in view of the patent to Friederich. As stated by the board: \u201cThe Friederich patent shows an arc lamp having electrodes, one or both of which may be heated, which may embody an active emitter, which are designed to operate in a gaseous medium and in one which is charged with mercury vapor. Among the gases contemplated argon is mentioned, also nitrogen, and a statement is made that these gases may be mixed. Mercury vapor is also employed, as above intimated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AtK\">In view of the teachings of the patents <em>to </em>Skaupy and Friederich, the board con<em>cluded </em>that: \u201cThe disclosure of this patent is anticipative of anything taught with respect to the use of mixtures of mercury vapor and gases in this application as filed, It also anticipates its generic teachings as to the use of alkali metals to assist starting.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Acgb\">With reference to the question of undue multiplicity of claims, the Solicitor for the Patent Office stated in his brief that: \u201cAside from the electrical circuits and connections to the electrodes, which are involved in the appealed claims only in a broad way, there is left nothing of appellant\u2019s device but the tube with electrodes at each end and a gaseous filling therefor. On this simpie subject matter, aside from the ten claims allowed, appellant has seen fit to present the some tirty-four claims involved on the appeal. The statutes require (U. S. C. title 35, \u00a7 33 [35 USC \u00a7 33]) that the applicant, in order to obtain a patent, shall particularly point out and distinctly claim the part, improvement, _ or combination which he claims as his invention or discovery.</p>\n<p id=\"agw-dedup-0\">In the case of Ex parte McCullough, supra, the Commissioner of Patents pointed out the difficulties attending the filing of patent applications containing undue multiplicity of claims, and stated that such applications interfered with the work of the Patent Office; that.they were unfair to the applicants themselves, to other inventors, and to the public; that they had been condemned by a committee representing the \u201cPatent Bar Association\u201d; that protracted consideration of such applications by the Patent Office had been criticized by committees of Congress; and that the courts had, at times, expressed disapproval of the issuance of patents con-taming an unnecessarily large number of claims.</p>\n<p id=\"aea-dedup-1\">Obviously, if permanent relief is to be had in the premises, it is necessary for the Patent Office tribunals to enforce complianee with the provisions of section 4888 of the Revised Statutes, as amended (U. S. C. title 35, \u00a7 33 [35 USCA \u00a7 33]), which read: \u201cBefore any inventor or discoverer shall re-ceive a patent for his invention or discovery he shall make application therefor, in writ-ing, to the Commissioner of Patents, and shall file in the Patent Office a written description of the same, and of the manner and process of making, constructing, compound-ing, and using it, <em>in such full, clear, concise, and exact terms as to enable any person skilled in the art or science to which it appertains, or with which it is most nearly connected, to make, construct, compound, and use the same; </em>and in case of a machine, he shall explain the principle thereof, and the best mode in which he has contemplated applying that principle, so as to distinguish it from other inventions; <em>and he shall particularly point out and distinctly claim the part, improvement, or combination which he claims </em>as_ <em>his invention or discovery. </em>The specification and claim shall be signed by inventor. No plant patent shall be dedared invalid on the ground of noncomplianee with this section <em>if the description is made as complete as is reasonably possible.\u201d </em>(Italics ours.)</p>\n<p id=\"aou-dedup-0\">We are not unmindful of the fact that it is sometimes difficult to define an alleged in vertion with conciseness and precision. However, such difficulty ought not to be used as an excuse to present an unnecessary large number of claims, the net result of which is to confuse, rather than to clarify the issues relative to an alleged improvement which it is claimed, involves invention.</p>\n<p id=\"Apbh\">,Although we are in entire accord with sPecffic reasons assigned and discussed by the Board of. Appeals m its rejection of appealed claims, we are of opinion, nevertheless, that' they might well have been rejected on the sole ground of undue multiplicity. In re Duncan, 49 App. D. C. 372, 265 F. 1012, affirming the decision of the .Commissioner of Patents in Ex parte Duncan, 1920 C. D. 36. See, also, In re Dann, supra; In re Spencer, supra,</p>\n<p id=\"A_2\">The appeal as to claims 1, 8, 9, 10, 32 to 43 inclusive 56, 57 and 66 is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"ARx4\">As to the other appealed claims, the decision of the Board of APPeals is affirmed,</p>\n<p id=\"Ap_k\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
