Even if Elliott alone is not enough to anticipate claim _1, we cannot hold that invention was involved in making the adjustments necessary for the patent m suit out of parts shown in Brownson, Pitney, Elliott, and Kreuger\u2019s first patent. The defendants\u2019 new ground of attack, based on failure to disclaim after Judge Hickenlooper\u2019s decision holding invalid certain claims of the parent patent, No. 1,638,815, has not been considered, as it is not presented by this record,</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
