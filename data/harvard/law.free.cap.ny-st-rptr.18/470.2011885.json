Y., 515; 2 N. Y. State Rep., 29.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b512-15\">By the terms of that written agreement, the plaintiff Clark contracted to manufacture certain material supplied him by the defendants, into \u201c available phosphoric acid.\u201d There is nothing in that agreement providing that the phosphoric acid, when thus manufactured, should possess any quality other than that meant and described by the word, \u201c available.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b512-16\">On delivery by plaintiff to defendants of the phosphoric acid, when thus manufactured by him, defendants sold it to a firm doing business in Bedford, Massachusetts, at a price agreed on between them. This firm, on examination of the phosphoric acid, refused to take it at the agreed price, on the ground that it was not equal in quality to a sample shown them, and was inferior in character. Subsequently, however, they agreed to take it on a reduction of the price,and did take it, and paid for it the price as reduced. This reduction of price was made with the assent of both the plaintiff and the defendants.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b512-17\">This sale of the phosphoric acid is sufficient proof that it was \u201cavailable\u201d for one at least of the chief purposes for which the parties plaintiff and defendant made their agreement.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b512-18\">There is no evidence that the inferiority in the phosphoric acid, as manufactured by the plaintiff, was the result of any negligence on his part. On the contrary, it appears that its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>inferiority was the result of inherent defects in the condition of the material itself, before the process of its manufacture into phosphoric acid was applied. \"</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b513-3\">The loss caused by the reduction in the selling price should, in my opinion, have been borne jointly by the plaintiff and the defendants, in proportion to the amounts invested by each of them, and such was, I think, the manifest intention of the written agreement between them.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b513-4\">The plaintiff should, therefore, have judgment in his favor granting him the relief demanded in his complaint, with costs.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b513-5\"><em>Jacob F. Miller, </em>for app'lts; <em>Hugh </em>A. <em>McTernan, </em>for resp\u2019t.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b513-6\">Per Curiam.</author>\n<p id=\"AmAI\">The reason assigned' by the trial judge for refusing to dismiss the complaint was erroneous, but the ruling was correct. The action was for an accounting and the record shows that the counterclaim to which the plaintiff made no reply, was allowed to the defendants in the computation of the amount for which the plaintiff had judgment. As to the merits, the opinion delivered by the learned judge at special term is correct. The record discloses no error, and, upon the whole case, it appears that, substantial justice has been done.\"</p>\n<p id=\"b513-7\">Judgment affirmed with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
