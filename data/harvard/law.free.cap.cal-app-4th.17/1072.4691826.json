The board initiated disciplinary action against Stempf and a hearing was set before an administrative law judge (acting under the auspices of the Department of General Services of the State of California). In anticipation of the hearing, Stempf served 17 or more subpoenas duces tecum on Sehlmeyer\u2019s past and present physicians and psychotherapists and her former attorneys. Copies of the subpoenas were served on the board but no notice of any kind was given to Sehlmeyer. The records were produced to the ALJ at a prehearing conference and the ALJ gave them to Stempf s attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-8\">When Sehlmeyer discovered the disclosure, she filed a petition for a writ of mandate to compel the Department of General Services to quash the subpoenas and return the documents. The Board of Psychology (as one real party in interest) did not oppose the petition and disclaimed any interest in Sehlmeyer\u2019s personal records.  Stempf (the other real party in interest) claimed the petition was moot because the disciplinary action had been settled but nevertheless insisted the records had been properly subpoenaed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b813-9\">The trial court granted the petition, finding service of the subpoenas without prior notice to Sehlmeyer violated her right of privacy, and ordered Stempf to pay Sehlmeyer\u2019s attorney fees of $70,830.  Stempf appeals from the judgment commanding the Department of General Services to quash the subpoenas and return the records, and from the order directing him to pay Sehlmeyer\u2019s attorney fees.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b814-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1076\">*1076</page-number>Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b814-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-5\">Stempf contends his subpoenas comply with the literal letter of the law as expressed in the Government Code. According to Stempf, this means no notice to Sehlmeyer was required (and also means the trial court was wrong). We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-7\">Section 1985 et seq. of the Code of Civil Procedure covers the means of production of persons and papers in civil proceedings. Section 1985 defines a subpoena, sets forth the requirement of an affidavit to support a subpoena duces tecum, and provides for the issuance of signed subpoenas in blank. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1985, subds. (a)-(c).) Section 1985.1 covers agreements to appear at a time other than specified in the subpoena and section 1985.2 addresses the notice to be given to the subpoenaed witness. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7\u00a7 1985.1, 1985.2.) Finally (at least for purposes of this case), section 1985.3 of the Code of Civil Procedure conditions the issuance of a subpoena duces tecum requesting specified personal records upon timely notice to the consumer whose records are sought.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b814-8\">In proceedings conducted pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act (Gov. Code, \u00a7 11370 et seq.), section 11510 of the Government Code authorizes issuance of subpoenas duces tecum in accordance with the general provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure and specifically incorporates Code of Civil Procedure sections 1985, 1985.1, and 1985.2\u2014but section 11510 of the Government Code does not incorporate (or even refer to) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1077\">*1077</page-number>section 1985.3 of the Code of Civil Procedure.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> According to Stempf, the Legislature\u2019s failure to mention Code of Civil Procedure section 1985.3 in subdivision (a) of section 11510 of the Government Code demonstrates a specific intent to exclude administrative subpoenas from the operation of section 1985.3. We do not engage in the somewhat sticky statutory analysis required to resolve this point\u2014because even if Stempf is correct, there still exists a constitutional and common law right to privacy which resolves the underlying issue against Stempf.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-6\">The road to Code of Civil Procedure section 1985.3 was paved by our Supreme Court in <em>Valley Bank of Nevada </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1975) 15 Cal.3d 652 [125 Cal.Rptr. 553, 542 P.2d 977], <em>(Sasson </em>v. <em>Katash </em>(1983) 146 Cal.App.3d 119, 124 [194 Cal.Rptr. 46].) Although the Legislature later constructed a direct route to resolve the issue in civil proceedings (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1985.3), the old road still exists and it leads ineluctably to the conclusion we reach in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-7\">In <em>Valley Bank, </em>a bank sued a borrower to recover the balance due on a construction loan. The defendant, in turn, claimed the bank had misled him with misrepresentations that additional financing would be provided. To prove his allegations, the defendant noticed the deposition of the bank\u2019s chairman and asked him to bring with him records of the bank\u2019s transactions with several named persons, corporations and associations, all of whom were customers of the bank. The bank objected to the disclosure of its customers\u2019 records, asserting its obligation to protect the privacy of its nonparty customers. The trial court overruled the objection and ordered the bank to produce the records. On the bank\u2019s petition, the Supreme Court issued a writ of mandate. <em>(Valley Bank of Nevada </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>15 Cal.3d at pp. 654-655.)</p>\n<p id=\"b816-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1078\">*1078</page-number>First, the Supreme Court concluded the records were relevant to establish an estoppel or fraud defense to the bank\u2019s suit. Second, the court held that \u201cit is clear that the privileges contained in the Evidence Code are <em>exclusive </em>and the courts are not free to create new privileges as a matter of judicial policy.\u201d (15 Cal.3d at p. 656.) But the court also held that, despite the exclusivity of the Evidence Code on the subject of privileges and the absence of either common law or statutory protection, overriding constitutional considerations compelled recognition of some limited form of protection for confidential information given to a bank by its customers.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-4\">The basis for this conclusion was, of course, the constitutional amendment adopted in 1974 which \u201celevated the right of privacy to an \u2018inalienable right\u2019 expressly protected by force of constitutional mandate. (Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a7 1.)\u201d <em>(Valley Bank of Nevada </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>15 Cal.3d at p. 656.) Although the amendment was then new, the court considered it safe to \u201cassume that the right of privacy extends to one\u2019s confidential financial affairs as well as to the details of one\u2019s personal life.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>The issue then was one of \u201ccareful balancing of the right of civil litigants to discover relevant facts, on the one hand, with the right of bank customers to maintain reasonable privacy regarding their financial affairs, on the other.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 657.) As there was then no statutory attempt to achieve any balance at all, and no provision in the existing discovery scheme to protect the customers\u2019 constitutional right to privacy, it fell to the court to do the balancing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b816-5\">\u201cThe protection of such right should not be left entirely to the election of third persons who may have their own personal reasons for permitting or resisting disclosure of confidential information received from others. On the other hand, we readily acknowledge that relevant bank customer information should not be wholly privileged and insulated from scrutiny by civil litigants. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b816-6\">\u201cStriking a balance between the competing considerations, we conclude that before confidential customer information may be disclosed in the course of civil discovery proceedings, the bank must take reasonable steps to notify its customer of the pendency and nature of the proceedings and to afford the customer a fair opportunity to assert his interests by objecting to disclosure, by seeking an appropriate protective order, or by instituting other legal proceedings to limit the scope or nature of the matters sought to be discovered.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b816-7\">\u201cThe variances of time, place, and circumstance which may invoke application of the foregoing principle cannot be anticipated, but in evaluating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1079\">*1079</page-number>claims for protection of bank customers, the trial courts are vested with the same discretion which they generally exercise in passing upon other claims of confidentiality. . . . They include *. . . the purpose of the information sought, the effect that disclosure will have on the parties and on the trial, the nature of the objections urged by the party resisting disclosure, and ability of the court to make an alternative order which may grant partial disclosure, disclosure in another form, or disclosure only in the event that the party seeking the information undertakes certain specified burdens which appear just under the circumstances.\u2019 <em>(Greyhound Corp. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1961) 56 Cal.2d 355, 382 [15 Cal.Rptr. 90, 364 P.2d 266].) Where it is possible to do so, \u2018. . . the courts should impose partial limitations rather than outright denial of discovery.\u2019 <em>(Id., </em>at p. 383.)\u201d <em>(Valley Bank of Nevada </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>15 Cal.3d at pp. 657-658.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b817-5\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-6\">The procedure adopted by the Supreme Court in <em>Valley Bank </em>works just as well in the administrative context as it did in civil proceedings. Using the facts of this case, we offer a road map for future administrative cases, borrowed from <em>Valley Bank, </em>modified as necessary to fit the administrative context and enhanced by the legislative insight afforded by section 1985.3 of the Code of Civil Procedure.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b817-7\">First, we give the benefit of the doubt to Stempf and assume Sehlmeyer\u2019s medical, psychiatric and legal records were somehow relevant to the disciplinary proceedings against Stempf.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-8\">Second, we conclude that the Legislature\u2019s failure to incorporate the notice provisions of Code of Civil Procedure section 1985.3 into Government Code section 11510 could not and does not diminish rights created by the California Constitution and that here, as in <em>Valley Bank, </em>overriding constitutional considerations compel recognition of some form of protection for information which is indisputably confidential. (Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a7 1; <em>Valley Bank of Nevada </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>15 Cal.3d at p. 656.) If this was true in <em>Valley Bank </em>in the absence of a statutory privilege to protect the bank\u2019s records, it must a fortiori be true here, where it appears all of the requested records were in fact privileged under express provisions of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1080\">*1080</page-number>Evidence Code. (Evid. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 950-955 [lawyer-client], 990-995 [physician-patient], 1010-1015 [psychotherapist-patient]; see also <em>Gilbert </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1987) 193 Cal.App.3d 161, 176 [238 Cal.Rptr. 220].)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b818-4\">Third, the issue is one of careful balancing of the rights of <em>administrative </em>litigants (as opposed to <em>civil </em>litigants, a distinction without a difference in this context) to discover relevant facts, on the one hand, with the rights of a third party witness to maintain reasonable privacy regarding her personal affairs, on the other. <em>(Valley Bank of Nevada </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>15 Cal.3d at p. 657.) As there is no provision in the existing administrative scheme to protect the third party witness\u2019s constitutional right to privacy or her statutory privilege rights, it falls to us and, ultimately, to the administrative tribunal to do the balancing.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-5\">Striking a balance between these competing considerations, we conclude that before confidential third party personal records<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> may be disclosed in the course of an administrative proceeding, the subpoenaing party<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> must take reasonable steps to notify the third party of the pendency and nature of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1081\">*1081</page-number>proceedings and to afford the third party a fair opportunity to assert her interests by objecting to disclosure, by seeking an appropriate protective order from the administrative tribunal, or by instituting other legal proceedings to limit the scope or nature of the matters sought to be discovered.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-5\">The variances of time, place, and circumstance which may invoke application of the foregoing principle cannot be anticipated, but in evaluating claims for protection of third party personal records, administrative law judges are vested with the same discretion which they generally exercise in passing upon other claims of confidentiality. (See Gov. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 11512, 11513; see Cal. Administrative Hearing Practice (Cont.Ed.Bar 1984) Hearing Procedure, \u00a7 3.50, pp. 194-195.) In exercising discretion in this context, the ALJ should consider the purpose of the information sought, the effect disclosure will have on the parties and on the hearing, the nature of the objections urged by the party resisting disclosure, and the ability of the ALJ to make an alternative order granting partial disclosure, disclosure in another form, or disclosure only in the event the party seeking the information undertakes certain specified burdens which appear just under the circumstances. <em>(Greyhound Corp. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>56 Cal.2d at p. 382.) Whenever possible, the ALJ should impose partial limitations rather than an outright denial of discovery. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 383.)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b820-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1082\">*1082</page-number>We hope this approach works on an interim basis and encourage the Legislature to act expeditiously to address the problem.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-4\">II.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b820-5\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b820-6\">The judgment and order are affirmed.

Accordingly, the facts alleged in the petition are uncontroverted and are deemed true on this appeal. <em>(Pacific Indem. Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1966) 246 Cal.App.2d 63, 65, fn. 2 [54 Cal.Rptr. 470].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b813-11\">After Stempf filed his appellant\u2019s opening brief, Sehlmeyer filed a motion for an \u201corder summarily affirming [the] judgment,\u201d contending Stempi\u2019s failure to present evidence at trial affects his right to appeal. We disagree. The issue is one of law and we therefore reach the merits of the appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b814-9\">Under section 1985.3 of the Code of Civil Procedure, books, documents and other writings \u201cpertaining to a consumer\u201d and maintained by any \u201cwitness\u201d who is a physician, psychotherapist, hospital, attorney or other specified provider of consumer services cannot be subpoenaed unless, 15 days prior to the date of production specified in the subpoena, the subpoenaing party serves on the consumer whose records are sought a copy of the subpoena duces tecum, of the affidavit supporting the issuance of the subpoena, and of a notice informing the consumer that the records are being sought from the designated witness; notice that the consumer may object to the production of the records by filing papers with the court prior to the date specified in the subpoena for production; and notice that if the requesting party refuses to agree in writing to cancel the subpoena, an attorney should be consulted. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1985.3, subds.

(Stats. 1986, ch. 597, \u00a7 1, p. 2067.) Section 1985.3 of the Code of Civil Procedure existed at that time (it was enacted in 1980).

We do not address Sehlmeyer\u2019s rights, if any, against the health care providers who turned over records without her consent. (See also Evid.

But we emphasize that we do not in this case intend to express an opinion about whether a person who complains to a licensing agency thereby waives any privilege which would otherwise exist between the complainant and the licensee, under the patient-litigant exception to the physician-patient privilege (Evid. Code, \u00a7 996) or otherwise. (See Gov. Code, \u00a7 11513, subd.

Although we agree with Stempi that this issue must at some point be resolved, we don\u2019t agree that this is the case in which to do it. The absence of notice to Sehlmeyer precluded resolution of this issue at the administrative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1082\">*1082</page-number>level and the state of the record before us precludes resolution at this stage.
