The sole issue is whether a third party claim, resulting from an auto accident, is covered under a business liability policy which purports to exclude coverage for automobile-related losses. We conclude that the policy does not provide coverage for the losses in this case, and we affirm the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b93-7\">The facts are based on a stipulation of the parties and are undisputed. Defendant\u2019s insured, Wilcox, owned a welding business which was insured by defendant. In his spare time, Wilcox rebuilt cars. He owned and rebuilt a 1934 Bantam Coupe, including welding the chassis to the frame of the vehicle. In October 1984, Wilcox, with plaintiff\u2019s decedent Hayes as a passenger, drove the vehicle at speeds exceeding 90 miles per hour. The vehicle crossed the center line of the road and struck a vehicle operated by plaintiff Gurrola, who was seriously injured. Both Wilcox and Hayes were killed in the accident. The accident was caused by Wilcox\u2019s negligent operation of the vehicle and negligent reconstruction of the vehicle, including the welding. Both Hayes\u2019s survivors and Gurrola sued the Wilcox estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-8\">Defendant insured Wilcox\u2019s welding business under a comprehensive general liability policy. Wilcox was the named insured. The policy provided as relevant: \u201cThis insurance does not apply ... [to injury or damage] arising out of the ownership, maintenance, operation, use, . . . of . . . any automobile . . . owned or operated by . . . any insured . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b93-9\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b93-10\">The simple issue in this case is, as noted, whether the business liability policy issued by defendant covers the injuries and damage resulting from the auto accident, notwithstanding the apparently clear exclusion of injury or damage arising out of the ownership, maintenance, operation or use of any automobile. Plaintiffs\u2019 theory is that because the accident was caused both by the negligent operation of the vehicle and the negligent welding of the vehicle, the injuries and damages are covered under Wilcox\u2019s welding business policy. The theory is without merit, and has been rejected by nearly every Court of Appeal which has ruled on the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-11\">Plaintiffs rely on <em>State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Partridge </em>(1973) 10 Cal.3d 94 [109 Cal.Rptr. 811, 514 P.2d 123], In <em>Partridge, </em>the insured under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>a homeowners policy was a hunting enthusiast who had filed the trigger mechanism of his handgun so that the weapon had a hair-trigger action. The insured and his friends were hunting by shooting from the windows of the insured\u2019s vehicle. The insured hit a bump and the weapon discharged, hitting one of his friends, who, as a result, was paralyzed. (10 Cal.3d at pp. 97-98.) Although the insured\u2019s homeowners policy contained an exclusion for injuries arising out of the use of a motor vehicle, the court held that the policy provided coverage for the injuries sustained. The court found that \u201calthough the accident occurred in a vehicle, the insured\u2019s negligent modification of the gun suffices, in itself, to render him fully liable for the resulting injuries. . . . [I]nasmuch as the liability of the insured arises from his non-auto-related conduct, and exists independently of any \u2018use\u2019 of his car, we believe the homeowner\u2019s policy covers that liability.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 103.)</p>\n<p id=\"b94-4\">In <em>State Farm Fire &amp; Cas. Co. </em>v. <em>Camara </em>(1976) 63 Cal.App.3d 48 [133 Cal.Rptr. 600], <em>Partridge </em>was distinguished based on facts that are effectively identical to those involved in our case. In <em>Camara, </em>the insured under a homeowners policy with an auto use exclusionary clause, was driving a dune buggy when a \u201ccollision\u201d occurred causing injuries to the plaintiff passenger. The plaintiff alleged that the insured had negligently designed, constructed and assembled the vehicle so as to \u201c \u2018proximately cause the vehicle to overturn.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 50.) The court held that under <em>Partridge, </em>\u201cthe nonvehicle-related cause must be independent of the vehicle-related cause in order for the liability to be covered\u201d by the homeowners policy <em>(id., </em>at pp. 54-55) and found no coverage under that policy. The <em>Camara </em>court pointed out that \u201cthe <em>only </em>way in which plaintiff could have been exposed to the claimed design risk was through the operation or use of the motor vehicle.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 55.) In this case, too, the only way that plaintiff or the decedent could have been exposed to the risk of the negligent welding was through the operation or use of the motor vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">We are aware of no case after <em>Camara </em>which has not applied the principle that a homeowners policy provides no coverage for auto-related accidents unless there are \u201c \u2018two negligent acts or omissions of the insured, one of which, <em>independently of the excluded cause, </em>renders the insured liable for the resulting injuries. [Citations.]\u2019 \u201d <em>(National American Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Cobum </em>(1989) 209 Cal.App.3d 914, 919 [257 Cal.Rptr. 591], and see discussion therein.)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">Plaintiffs, however, rely on <em>Gonzalez </em>v. <em>St. Paul Mercury Ins. Co. </em>(1976) 60 Cal.App.3d 675 [131 Cal.Rptr. 626], in which coverage was found under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>a homeowners policy with an auto use exclusionary clause, based on the facts that the insured negligently repaired the brakes, \u201ca negligent act occurring on the premises of the insured,\u201d and that the insured was involved in an accident injuring a third party while driving the vehicle. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 680.)  We agree, however, with <em>Camara </em>and cases following that the liability must arise from nonvehicular conduct and must exist independently of the use or ownership of the vehicle: \u201cWe can only observe that the <em>St. Paul Mercury </em>court has fallen into the same error as the <em>Pacific Employers [Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Maryland Casualty Co. </em>(1966) 65 Cal.2d 318 (54 Cal.Rptr. 385, 419 P.2d 641)] court. A hundred similar cases can be conceived. Today the defendant-owner negligently repairs the brakes; tomorrow he carelessly leaves worn tires on the vehicle (which later result in a blowout) or he fails to apply the hand brake when parked on a hill (as a result of which it rolls uncontrolled down the hill). . . . Injury from any such acts unquestionably arises out of the ownership, maintenance, operation, use, etc. of the vehicle, yet under the <em>St. Paul Mercury </em>holding it is still covered when the homeowner\u2019s policy\u201d\u2014here, business liability policy\u2014\u201cclearly says it is not.\u201d <em>(State Farm Fire &amp; Cas. Co. </em>v. <em>Camara, supra, </em>63 Cal.App.3d at p. 55.)</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">Plaintiffs, recognizing the uphill battle, rely on <em>Garvey </em>v. <em>State Farm Fire &amp; Casualty Co. </em>(1989) 48 Cal.3d 395 [257 Cal.Rptr. 292, 770 P.2d 704], for language which, plaintiffs contend, bolsters their position that <em>Partridge </em>does not say what it said and that <em>Camara </em>and cases following are simply wrong. <em>Garvey </em>cannot rationally be read to support plaintiffs\u2019 hopes. First, <em>Garvey </em>had nothing to do with a third party claim; rather <em>Garvey </em>held that the dual causation concept, allowed in <em>Partridge </em>in third party claims, does not apply in first party claims. <em>(Garvey </em>v. <em>State Farm Fire &amp; Casualty Co., supra, </em>48 Cal.3d at pp. 406-408.) Second, the language quoted by plaintiffs from <em>Garvey </em>about the intended meaning of <em>Partridge </em>as applied to third party claims is too remote from the issues facing the court in <em>Garvey </em>to be read as a reinterpretation of <em>Partridge, </em>particularly in light of the disclaimer also quoted by plaintiff.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b96-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>Finally, plaintiffs contend that the insured\u2019s negligent welding of the vehicle is not an excluded risk because the welding involved \u201creconstruction\u201d and not \u201cmaintenance.\u201d Plaintiffs\u2019 point is not clear; the exclusionary clause, as discussed, excludes injury arising out of the ownership, maintenance, operation or use of the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-4\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">Epstein, Acting P. J., and Vogel (C. S.), J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-7\">Appellants\u2019 petition for review by the Supreme Court was denied July 15, 1993. Mosk, J., was of the opinion that the petition should be granted.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b93-12\">Judge of the Los Angeles Superior Court sitting under assignment by the Chairperson of the Judicial Council.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b94-7\">Plaintiffs do <em>not </em>contend that a different result should obtain because this policy is a business liability policy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b95-6\">We quote some of plaintiffs\u2019 quote: \u201cIn analyzing the liability coverage [in Partridge], we explicitly recognized, the efficient cause language [of Sabella] is not very helpful, for here both causes were independent of each other: the filing of the trigger did not cause the careless driving, nor vice versa. Both, however, caused the injury. . . . We concluded by stating, Although there may be some question whether either of the two causes in the instant case can be properly characterized as <em>the </em>prime, moving or efficient cause of the accident we believe that coverage under a liability insurance policy is equally available to an insured whenever an insured risk constitutes simply a concurrent proximate cause of the injuries. \u201d (See 48 Cal.3d at p. 405.)</p>\n<p id=\"b95-7\">\u201cAlthough the Court of Appeal refused to confine the application of <em>Partridge </em>to liability cases, the court did attempt to limit the scope of <em>Partridge\u2019s </em>concurrent causation standard in both liability and property cases by requiring the included and excluded perils to be</p>\n<p id=\"AWj\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>independent of origin <em>and </em>independent in operation. Specifically, the Court of Appeal interpreted <em>Partridge, supra, </em>10 Cal.3d 94, as holding that because each act could have caused the loss regardless of the existence of the other act [citation], they were independent of each other. According to the Court of Appeal: Neither [cause in Partridge] can be said to have necessarily acted upon a condition created by the other, or to have propelled the other, or to have brought to fruition the potential for damage inherent in the other. The Court of Appeal believed the <em>Partridge </em>court would not have found the covered risk to be independent if that risk (negligence).existed only in relation to, [or was dependent on] an excluded risk. Thus, the Court of Appeal determined that in order for coverage to be found under <em>Partridge, </em>the concurrent event <em>alone </em>must have been a sufficient condition of the loss\u2014i.e., capable of producing damage itself.\u201d (See 48 Cal.3d at p. 409.)</p>\n<p id=\"b96-9\">\u201cThe term \u2018sufficient condition\u2019 as used by the Court of Appeal <em>misapplied the Partridge holding </em>because it implied that negligent driving alone could have caused plaintiff\u2019s injury in that case. Although we point out the court\u2019s analytical error for purposes of clarifying any confusion the term may have caused, we leave the application of <em>Partridge </em>in the liability context to a future liability case that raises the concurrent causation issue.\u201d (See 48 Cal.3d at p. 409, fn. 8, italics added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
