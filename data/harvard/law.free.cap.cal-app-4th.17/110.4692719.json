J.</author>\n<p id=\"Af\">Permea, Inc., and its subsidiary, Zeks Air Dryer Corporation (collectively Zeks) appeal after a jury awarded plaintiff Anthony J. Roslan approximately $563,000 in his action for personal injuries. One third of the award was for noneconomic damages. The primary problem with this case is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>that the trial court did not allow the jury to assess the comparative fault of two defendants which settled before trial, and also refused to allow Zeks to present evidence of the culpability of one of those settling defendants. The jury was therefore unable to assess the settling defendants\u2019 comparative fault. Such a determination was crucial because, under Proposition 51 (Civ. Code, \u00a7 1431.2), Zeks is only severally liable for any noneconomic damages. Without knowing the settling defendants\u2019 proportionate fault, we have no way of determining how much of the noneconomic award that Zeks must pay. Accordingly, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-4\">Facts<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">I*</p>\n<p id=\"b100-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b100-8\">Defendant Allied Container (Allied), which designed and manufactured the shipping carton which allegedly caused Roslan\u2019s injuries, settled before trial for $15,000, and another defendant (Benz Engineering) settled for $10,000. The trial court found these settlements to be in good faith. At trial, Zeks sought to introduce deposition testimony of an Allied representative which, according to Zeks\u2019 counsel, would show that Allied \u201ccontributed in the design of this packaging system and that they came out to the Zeks plant\u2014\u2018they\u2019 being the Allied representatives\u2014[] in an attempt to come together on a packaging scheme suitable to the 35-model [i.e., the shipping carton]. . . .\u201d The trial court refused to admit this evidence.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Thus, the jury did not assess the amount of comparative fault of either of the settling defendants. That may not seem like a striking development; however, the passage of Proposition 51 (Civ. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 1431 to 1431.5) greatly complicates matters. Under that initiative, Zeks is only responsible for its comparative percentage of fault for the noneconomic damages (i.e., pain and suffering) of $268,481.56. (See generally <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Stouffer </em>(1992) 9 Cal.App.4th 70, 82-83 [11 Cal.Rptr.2d 454].) While that award was reduced by the 30 percent comparative fault of Roslan, it was not reduced by the comparative fault of the settling defendants. This error mandates reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>In <em>DaFonte </em>v. <em>Up-Right, </em>Inc. (1992) 2 Cal.4th 593 [7 Cal.Rptr.2d 238, 828 P.2d 140], our Supreme Court set forth why we reach this result: \u201cThe express purpose of Proposition 51 was to eliminate the perceived unfairness of imposing \u2018all the damage\u2019 on defendants who were \u2018found to share [only] a fraction of the fault.\u2019 ([Civ. Code,] \u00a7 1431.1, subd. (b).) In this context, the only reasonable construction of section 1431.2 is that a \u2018defendant\u2019s]\u2019 liability for noneconomic damages cannot exceed his or her proportionate share of fault <em>as compared with all fault responsible for the plaintiff\u2019s injuries, </em>not merely that of \u2018defendants]\u2019 present in the lawsuit.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 603, italics in original.) The <em>DaFonte </em>court cited Justce Kaufman\u2019s separate opinion in <em>Evangelatos </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1988) 44 Cal.3d 1188 [246 Cal.Rptr. 629, 753 P.2d 585] for the proposition that damages must be apportioned among the \u201c \u2018universe\u2019 of tortfeasors,\u201d including nonjoined defendants. <em>(DaFonte, supra, 2 </em>CalAth at p. 603, citing <em>Evangelatos, supra, </em>44 Cal.3d 1188, 1242, fn. 4 (cone, and dis. opn. of Kaufman, J.).)</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">In the present case, liability was not apportioned among the \u201cuniverse of tortfeasors,\u201d which included Allied and Benz Engineering. The trial court went even further, however, and refused to permit Zeks to present evidence of Allied\u2019s alleged culpability. Thus, the settling defendants were not included in the special verdict form, and the jury had no evidence from which to assess their comparative fault. The matter must be remanded so that the jury can make these determinations, because Zeks is only liable for its fair share of Roslan\u2019s noneconomic damages.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">Ill, IV<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b101-7\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b101-8\">The judgment is reversed and remanded for a new trial consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-9\">Moore, J., and Crosby, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-10\">A petition for a rehearing was denied August 12, 1993.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b100-9\">See footnote, <em>ante, </em>page 110.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b100-10\">Zeks did not offer any evidence as to the culpability of Benz Engineering.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b101-11\">On remand, we suggest using a modified version of BAJI No. 16.00 or BAJI No. 16.73 (1992 re-revisions), which are special verdict forms and which contemplate allocation of fault among defendants not present at trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b101-12\">See footnote, <em>ante, </em>page 110.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
