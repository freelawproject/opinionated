She sued the organization sponsoring the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>dance and the public agency owning the dance hall. The trial court granted summary judgment against plaintiff based upon her assumption of the risk. We shall reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-4\">Factual and Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">Plaintiff filed a complaint for personal injury against the local and international chapters of Parents Without Partners (collectively, Parents Without Partners), sponsors of the event, and the Chico Area Recreation and Park District (District), owner of the Melody Dance Hall where the incident occurred. Plaintiff alleged general negligence and premises liability in her complaint. Parents Without Partners cross-complained against the District for indemnity.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">The District and Parents Without Partners jointly moved for summary judgment based on the doctrine of reasonable implied assumption of risk.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-7\">The following facts are taken from the defendants\u2019 separate statements of undisputed facts which plaintiff agreed were not in dispute:</p>\n<p id=\"b251-8\">Before her accident, plaintiff attended at least 36 dances sponsored by Parents Without Partners at the Melody Dance Hall in the past 7 years. When plaintiff first arrived at the dance on the night in question she observed a substance on the dance floor which she thought to be Ivory Snow Rakes. She had seen this substance used on the floor on at least three prior occasions and was aware the substance made it easier for the dancer\u2019s foot to slide on the floor. At dances before her accident when she saw the substance of the floor, plaintiff would not dance until the floor was swept. On those prior occasions, the floor would continue to be swept on and off through the evening.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-9\">On the evening of her accident, plaintiff waited until the substance had been swept once before she danced. Although the floor had been swept once, the substance was still visible. Plaintiff slipped and fell while dancing. After her fall, she noticed the substance on her clothes.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-10\">In addition to plaintiff\u2019s response to the defendants\u2019 statement of undisputed facts, plaintiff filed her own statement of undisputed facts.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In that statement plaintiff asserted the following facts were undisputed:</p>\n<p id=\"b252-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>The substance was applied to the floor to make it easier to dance, not to make the floor slippery. Plaintiff never danced on the floor when she was able to see that the substance was on the floor.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Plaintiff had danced two dances without incident on the night of the accident and was dancing the third dance when she slipped and fell. She did not see any other person slip and fall that night before her accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-4\">The trial court granted the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b252-7\">\n<em>Standard of Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b252-8\">\u201cA motion for summary judgment \u2018shall be granted if all the papers submitted show that there is no triable issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u2019 (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 437c, subd. (c).)  The purpose of summary judgment is to penetrate evasive language and adept pleading and to ascertain, by means of affidavits, the presence or absence of triable issues of fact.\u201d <em>(Molko </em>v. <em>Holy Spirit Assn. </em>(1988) 46 Cal.3d 1092, 1107 [252 Cal.Rptr. 122, 762 P.2d 46].) Consequently, \u201c[a] defendant is entitled to summary judgment if the record establishes as a matter of law that none of the plaintiff\u2019s asserted causes of action can prevail.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b252-9\">\u201cSince a summary judgment motion raises only questions of law regarding the construction and effect of the supporting and opposing papers, we independently review them on appeal, applying the same three-step analysis required of the trial court. . . . First, we identify the issues framed by tiie pleadings since it is these allegations to which the motion must respond by establishing a complete defense or otherwise showing there is no factual basis for relief on any theory reasonably contemplated by the opponent\u2019s pleading. ...[&lt;][] Secondly, we determine whether the moving <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>party\u2019s showing has established facts which negate the opponent\u2019s claim and justify a judgment in movant\u2019s favor. . . . [f] When a summary judgment motion prima facie justifies a judgment, the third and final step is to determine whether the opposition demonstrates the existence of a triable, material factual issue.\u201d <em>(AARTS Productions, Inc. </em>v. <em>Crocker National Bank </em>(1986) 179 Cal.App.3d 1061, 1064-1065 [225 Cal.Rptr. 203], citations omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b253-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">\n<em>Assumption of the Risk</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">After the trial court entered judgment in this case, the Supreme Court issued two opinions concerning the doctrine of assumption of the risk. <em>(Knight </em>v. <em>Jewett </em>(1992) 3 Cal.4th 296 [11 Cd.Rptr.2d 203, 834 P.2d 696]; <em>Ford </em>v. <em>Gouin </em>(1992) 3 Cal.4th 339 [11 Cal.Rptr.2d 30, 834 P.2d 724].) As we recently explained, \u201c[i]n <em>Ford, </em>Justice Arabian authored a lead opinion in which no other justice joined. In <em>Knight, </em>Justice George penned the lead opinion in which Chief Justice Lucas and Justice Arabian concurred. Justice Mosk provided a majority vote with a concurring opinion that agreed for the most part with the lead opinion. <em>(Knight, supra, </em>3 Cal.4th at p. 321, cone. &amp; dis. opn. of Mosk, J.) Because <em>Knight </em>commands a strong plurality, and because it speaks generally to the doctrine of implied assumption of the risk, we will follow <em>Knight </em>here.\u201d <em>(Davis </em>v. <em>Gaschler </em>(1992) 11 Cal.App.4th 1392, 1397 [14 Cal.Rptr.2d 679].)</p>\n<p id=\"b253-7\">According to the <em>Knight </em>court, the term \u201cassumption of risk\u201d applies to two different situations: \u201c(1) those instances in which the assumption of risk doctrine embodies a legal conclusion that there is \u2018no duty\u2019 on the part of the defendant to protect the plaintiff from a particular risk\u2014the category of assumption of risk that the legal commentators generally refer to as \u2018primary assumption of risk\u2019\u2014and (2) those instances in which the defendant does owe a duty of care to the plaintiff but the plaintiff knowingly encounters a risk of injury caused by the defendant\u2019s breach of the duty\u2014 what most commentators have termed \u2018secondary assumption of risk.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Knight, </em>supra, 3 Cal.4th at p. 308.) Thus, a primary assumption of risk bars a defendant\u2019s liability to the plaintiff for injury because the defendant has no legal duty to eliminate, or protect the plaintiff from, the risks.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-8\">\u201cAs a general rule,\u201d the <em>Knight </em>court went on, \u201cpersons have a duty to use due care to avoid injury to others, and may be held liable if their careless conduct injures another person. (See Civ. Code, \u00a7 1714.) Thus, for example, a property owner ordinarily is required to use due care to eliminate dangerous conditions on his or her property. (See, e.g., <em>Rowland </em>v. <em>Christian </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>(1968) 69 Cal.2d 108 [70 Cal.Rptr. 97, 443 P.2d 561, 32 A.L.R.3d 496].) In the sports setting, however, conditions or conduct that otherwise might be viewed as dangerous often are an integral part of the sport itself. Thus, although moguls on a ski run pose a risk of harm to skiers that might not exist were these configurations removed, the challenge and risks posed by the moguls are part of the sport of skiing, and a ski resort has no duty to eliminate them. (See generally Annot. (1987) 55 A.L.R.4th 632.) In this respect, the nature of a sport is highly relevant in defining the duty of care owed by the particular defendant.\u201d <em>(Knight, supra, </em>3 Cal.4th at p. 315.)</p>\n<p id=\"b254-4\">The plaintiff in <em>Knight </em>was injured in a touch football game when the defendant, another player, collided with her, knocked her over, and then stepped on her hand. Just before the play which resulted in the collision, the plaintiff had asked the defendant to be careful. (3 Cal.4th at p. 300.) The <em>Knight </em>court held this situation fell within the doctrine of primary assumption of risk because the risk of collision and injury is inherent in the game and the defendant\u2019s conduct was not \u201cso reckless as to be totally outside the range of the ordinary activity involved in the sport.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 320.)</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">In our view, the recreational dancing at issue here is not a sport within the ambit of <em>Knight. </em>Duty is constricted in the sports setting because the activity involves inherent risks which cannot be eliminated without destroying the sport itself. Sky diving, to take an extreme example, is inherently dangerous and cannot be made completely safe without altering the nature of the sport. Thus, in the sports context duty is fashioned \u201cin the process [of] defining the risks inherent in the sport not only by virtue of the nature of the sport itself, but also by reference to the steps the sponsoring business entity reasonably should be obligated to take in order to minimize the risks without altering the nature of the sport.\u201d (3 Cal.4th at p. 317.)</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">Indeed, it is an open question whether all sports are included within the limited duty of care rule of <em>Knight. </em>As the <em>Knight </em>court noted, the rule has been \u201cin situations involving a wide variety of active sports, ranging from baseball to ice hockey and skating. Because the touch football game at issue in this case clearly falls within the rationale of this rule, we have no occasion to decide whether a comparable limited duty of care appropriately should be applied to other less active sports, such as archery or golf.\u201d (3 Cal.4th at p. 320, fn. 7.) But whatever the reach of the rule, it would seem to apply only when engaging \u201cin a potentially dangerous activity or sport.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 311.) As we perceive it, recreational dancing is not such a dangerous activity. Consequently, this case involves what the <em>Knight </em>court calls \u201csecondary assumption of risk.\u201d In this type of case\u2014\u201cwhere the defendant does owe a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>duty of care to the plaintiff, but the plaintiff proceeds to encounter a known risk imposed by the defendant\u2019s breach of duty\u2014the doctrine [of assumption of the risk] is merged into the comparative fault scheme, and the trier of fact, in apportioning the loss resulting from the injury, may consider the relative responsibility of the parties.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 315.)</p>\n<p id=\"b255-4\">But even if the <em>Knight </em>rule governs recreational dancing, the trial court still erred in granting a summary judgment. Assuming for the sake of argument that falling is an inherent risk of social dancing (itself a dubious proposition), it does not follow that defendants have no duty when they increase the risk of falling by adding a slippery substance to the floor. Plaintiff argues that even if this case falls under primary assumption of risk, the defendants should be held liable because they increased the risk beyond that inherent in the activity. Plaintiff contends: \u201cHere [the defendants] increased the risk by putting the slippery substance on the floor, and by sweeping it up, giving the false impression of safety, but doing so negligently so that it left some of the substance on the floor, which was not apparent to plaintiff when she began dancing.\u201d We agree.  The <em>Knight </em>court warned: \u201cAlthough defendants generally have no legal duty to eliminate (or protect a plaintiff against) risks inherent in the sport itself, it is well established that defendants generally do have a duty to use due care not to increase the risks to a participant over and above those inherent in the sport. Thus, although a ski resort has no duty to remove moguls from a ski run, it clearly does have a duty to use due care to maintain its towropes in a safe, working condition so as not to expose skiers to an increased risk of harm. The cases establish that the latter type of risk, posed by a ski resort\u2019s negligence, clearly is not a risk (inherent in the sport) that is assumed by a participant.\u201d (3 Cal.4th at pp. 315-316.)</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">Assuming that falling is a risk inherent in dancing (say by tripping on the feet of one\u2019s partner or by losing one\u2019s balance due to the nature of the steps required), the dance hall operators and owners still have a duty to maintain the dance floor in a safe and useable condition. They breach that duty by adding a substance to the floor which makes it too slippery and thus increases the dancers\u2019 risk of harm by falling. After all, the nature of recreational dancing is not altered if the owners do not spread Ivory Snow Flakes on the floor. Consequently, falling on a dance floor because the operator negligently placed a slippery substance on the floor \u201cclearly is not a risk (inherent in the sport) that is assumed by a participant.\u201d (3 Cal.4th at pp. 315-316.)</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">It is no answer to say that dancing is inherently dangerous because some dancers have been known to injure themselves by falling. The same could be said of driving a vehicle or virtually any human activity. Once a defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>has breached a duty of care, plaintiff is not precluded from recovery simply because she chose to encounter a known risk of harm. <em>(.Knight, supra, </em>3 Cal.4th at p. 311.) \u201cAlthough every driver of an automobile is aware that driving is a potentially hazardous activity and that inherent in the act of driving is the risk that he or she will be injured by the negligent driving of another, a person who voluntarily chooses to drive does not thereby \u2018impliedly consent\u2019 to being injured by the negligence of another, nor has such a person \u2018impliedly excused\u2019 others from performing their duty to use due care for the driver\u2019s safety. Instead, the driver reasonably expects that if he or she is injured by another\u2019s negligence, i.e., by the breach of the other person\u2019s duty to use due care, the driver will be entitled to compensation for his or her injuries.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 311-312.) In this case the defendants breached a duty of care to the dancers by spreading a slippery substance on the floor and thereby increasing the risk of falling. Whatever fault may be attached to plaintiff for dancing on the slippery floor, that fault does not operate as a complete bar to her recovery. Because defendants failed to establish as a matter of law that none of plaintiff\u2019s asserted causes of action can prevail, they were not entitled to summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-4\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">The judgment is reversed and the cause remanded to the trial court with directions to enter a new and different order denying defendants\u2019 motions for summary judgment. Plaintiff shall recover her costs on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">Blease, Acting P. J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b251-11\">The summary judgment statute does not contemplate that the opposing party will file a statement of undisputed facts. Instead, it provides that \u201c[t]he opposition papers shall include a separate statement which responds to each of the material facts contended by the moving party to be undisputed, indicating whether the opposing party agrees or disagrees that those facts are undisputed. The statement also shall set forth plainly and concisely any other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>material facts which the opposing party concedes are disputed.\u201d (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 437c, subd. (b).) The defendants, however, did not object to the unorthodox procedure used by plaintiff and we shall therefore construe each of plaintiff\u2019s claimed undisputed facts as an obverse claim that these facts are disputed for purposes of the summary judgment motion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b252-11\">This statement is somewhat inconsistent with the plaintiff\u2019s earlier admission that after the floor had been swept the first time the substance was still visible on the floor. In plaintiff\u2019s opposing papers, her counsel explains that in her deposition plaintiff \u201cstates that she saw the floor was swept <em>after </em>her arrival and <em>before </em>she danced. It was only after plaintiff believed the substance was removed from the dance floor that she participated in dancing.\u201d (Italics in original.)</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b256-7\">NICHOLSON, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A82\">I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-8\">In my opinion, the type of activity in which the plaintiff engaged falls within the range of activities covered by the analysis in <em>Knight </em>v. <em>Jewett </em>(1992) 3 Cal.4th 296 [11 Cal.Rptr.2d 2, 834 P.2d 696]. While <em>Knight </em>involves an activity traditionally considered a \u201csport,\u201d the distinction between what is or is not a sport is unclear. In any event, the determination of whether primary assumption of risk applies does not hinge on whether the particular activity was a sport. \u201c[T]he question of the existence and scope of a defendant\u2019s duty of care is a <em>legal </em>question which depends on the nature of the sport <em>or activity </em>in question and on the parties\u2019 general relationship to the activity, . . .\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 313, first italics in original, latter italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b256-9\">The activity in which the plaintiff voluntarily engaged here was participation in a dance in which a slippery substance is spread on the floor. A substance was commonly spread on the floor at the dances intentionally to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>make the floor slippery and thereby enhance the activity. On and off through the evening of each dance, the floor was swept because, evidently, the first sweeping did not remove all of the substance. Thus, the activity was not just dancing; it was dancing on a slippery floor.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-4\">That the plaintiff did not like the fact the organizers spread the substance on the floor is beside the point. Likewise, her alleged perception the slippery substance had been swept up is irrelevant because \u201cthe duty approach . . . does not depend on the particular plaintiff\u2019s subjective knowledge or appreciation of the potential risk.\u201d <em>(Knight, supra, </em>3 Cal.4th at p. 316.)</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">The lead opinion in <em>Ford </em>v. <em>Gouin </em>(1992) 3 Cal.4th 339, 345 [11 Cal.Rptr.2d 30, 834 P.2d 724], explains the courts should not impose liability which \u201cmight well have a generally deleterious effect on the nature of the sport . . . .\u201d Imposing liability for the plaintiff\u2019s slip and fall here would effectively spell the discontinuation of slippery floor dancing, leaving only more docile forms of dancing. The majority effectively bans slippery floor dancing by finding a duty to the participant is breached when the dance hall operators and owners add a slippery substance to the floor. This is akin to forcing the ski resorts to remove all moguls by imposing liability on ski resorts for injuries caused by the moguls, a judicial imposition which <em>Knight </em>specifically disapproves. (3 Cal.4th at pp. 315-316, 318-319.)</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">I would find the plaintiff made a primary assumption of risk by participating in dancing on a slippery floor. Accordingly, I would affirm the judgment in favor of the defendants.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
