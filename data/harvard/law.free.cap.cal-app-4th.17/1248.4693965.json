J.</author>\n<p id=\"ASn\">Defendant and appellant Steven L. Edwards appeals the judgment entered following his conviction by jury of first degree burglary and two counts of grand theft. (Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 459, 460, subd. (a), 487, subd. 1.) Edwards admitted he had suffered a prior serious felony conviction within the meaning of Penal Code section 667, subdivision (a). The trial court sentenced Edwards to a term of nine years in state prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-5\">Summary Statement</p>\n<p id=\"b980-6\">Edwards burglarized the apartment of his former lover, Neil G. (Neil), and Neil\u2019s roommate, Michael H. (Michael), while they were away for the weekend.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-7\">The matter was tried commencing October 7,1991, in a courtroom usually occupied by a division of the Los Angeles Municipal Court and was presided over by a judge of the municipal court who had been assigned to sit as a judge of the superior court. Edwards contends the conviction must be reversed because, absent his consent to the location of the trial, the municipal court lacked jurisdiction to try the matter. (Gov. Code, \u00a7 69753; Cal. Rules of Court, rule 245.5(b).)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> However, because the trial was conducted at a location designated by ordinance as appropriate for sessions of the superior court, Edwards\u2019s consent to the location of the trial was not needed.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-8\">Also in issue is the propriety of a discovery sanction by which the trial court precluded Edwards from introducing evidence relative to Edwards\u2019s claim that, as Neil\u2019s business partner, he had a right to the property taken from the apartment. We evaluate this sanction in light of California\u2019s reciprocal discovery statute (Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 1054-1054.7) and United States Supreme Court cases which permit a preclusion sanction where an accused <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1253\">*1253</page-number>intentionally violates a discovery order so as to gain a tactical advantage at trial. We conclude such a sanction may be imposed if (1) both the intentional violation of the discovery order and the improper intent are shown on the record and, (2) all other less restrictive sanctions which would achieve the purposes of discovery have been exhausted.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-5\">Although the instant sanction reviewed under the foregoing standard was improper, no reversible prejudice to Edwards appears. Accordingly, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-6\">Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b981-7\">1. <em>Prosecution evidence.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b981-8\">Viewed in accordance with the usual rule of appellate review <em>(People </em>v. <em>Thomas </em>(1992) 2 Cal.4th 489, 514 [7 Cal.Rptr.2d 199, 828 P.2d 101]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Johnson </em>(1980) 26 Cal.3d 557, 575-578 [162 Cal.Rptr. 431, 606 P.2d 738, 16 A.L.R.4th 1255]), the evidence established that on May 24, 1991, Neil and Michael locked their apartment on Whitsett Avenue in North Hollywood and went to Palm Springs. As they were leaving, Edwards telephoned Neil and asked to retrieve property he had stored in Neil\u2019s garage. Neil told Edwards he would be out of town.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-9\">When Neil and Michael returned, they found the apartment had been broken into and the door to a locked bedroom had been forced open. Michael\u2019s microwave oven, coffee maker, phone answering machine, stereo equipment, wallet, credit cards and money were missing. Neil\u2019s TV, videocassette recorder, credit cards, and money were also missing.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-10\">Neil admitted he and Edwards previously had lived together at another residence and that the TV and videocassette recorder had been purchased while they lived there, but claimed he alone had paid for them. Neil\u2019s personal relationship with Edwards ended in April of 1989 and Neil moved into the Whitsett apartment in October of 1989.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-11\">On cross-examination, Edwards, who represented himself both at the preliminary hearing and at trial, asked Neil if he had commenced this action in order to \u201cappropriate our property to your own use.\u201d Neil denied he had.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-12\">Michael testified he and Neil had lived together in the Whitsett apartment since April of 1990 and Edwards had not lived there during that time. None of Michael\u2019s property taken in the burglary ever had belonged to Edwards. Edwards had visited the Whitsett apartment and at one time had a key to one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1254\">*1254</page-number>of the locks on the door. However, Michael took Edwards\u2019s key in March of 1991 when he learned Edwards had been evicted from his residence and was staying in Neil\u2019s garage.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-4\">Darryl Moore lived in the apartment above Neil and Michael. About 2 a.m. on May 26, 1991, Moore saw Edwards outside the back door of Neil\u2019s apartment. Twenty minutes later Moore heard glass breaking. The next day he was aware of someone moving about in Neil\u2019s apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-5\">In the early morning hours of May 27, 1991, Edwards awakened Donald Goodell at his residence and asked to spend the weekend at his home. Goodell reluctantly agreed and allowed Edwards to move items of personal property into Goodell\u2019s living room.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-6\">The following day Goodell discovered a check Edwards had given him a week earlier had bounced. The check was drawn on a business account and had Neil\u2019s telephone number on it. Goodell telephoned Neil and learned of the burglary. Neil\u2019s description of the property taken in the burglary matched the property Edwards had brought to Goodell\u2019s residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-7\">Neil received notice the check had bounced from the bank on May 24, 1991, the day he left for Palm Springs. After receiving this notice, Neil inspected his business checkbook and found three checks missing. Neil believed Edwards had taken the checks on May 15,1991, while he was at the apartment to store property in the garage.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-8\">In a telephone conversation with Neil in July 1991, Edwards admitted he had taken the property and said he had discarded Michael\u2019s wallet.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-9\">2. <em>Defense evidence.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b982-10\">Edwards produced a witness who testified he met Edwards at a party given by Neil to introduce Edwards as Neil\u2019s lover. The witness recalled Neil had a business which he and Edwards operated and that they had lived together in a furnished house.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-11\">3. <em>Edwards\u2019s theory of the case at trial.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b982-12\">During closing argument, Edwards asserted he and Neil had accumulated property during their relationship and that he had a right to take the property from the apartment. Edwards stated the case involved the purported burglary of \u201cwhat I\u2019ve alleged to be my own place.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b982-13\">Contentions</p>\n<p id=\"b982-14\">Edwards contends the trial court lacked jurisdiction to try this case and improperly excluded defense evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1255\">*1255</page-number>Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b983-5\">1. <em>Edwards was tried at a superior court location as required by section 69753.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b983-6\">a. <em>Background information.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b983-7\">On October 7, 1991, this case was transferred for trial from the Northwest District of the Los Angeles Superior Court located at 6230 Sylmar Avenue in Van Nuys, across the street to Division 115 of the Los Angeles Judicial District of the Los Angeles Municipal Court located at the Van Nuys Branch at 14400 Erwin Street Mall, Van Nuys. The judge of the municipal court presiding in that division was assigned to sit as a judge of the Superior Court of Los Angeles County by a blanket assignment issued by the Chief Justice and Chairperson of the Judicial Council.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b983-8\">Edwards contends the trial improperly was conducted at a municipal court location without his express written consent as required by section 69753 and California Rules of Court, rule 245.5(b). (See fn. 1, <em>ante.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b983-9\">The People concede Edwards\u2019s written consent to trial at a municipal court location was not obtained but point out he was tried before a judge of the superior court. They argue Edwards\u2019s submission to the authority of the court and the failure to object constituted a tantamount stipulation to the location of the trial. (See <em>In re Horton </em>(1991) 54 Cal.3d 82, 98-100 [284 Cal.Rptr. 305, 813 P.2d 1335] [defendant\u2019s participation in a death penalty trial, knowing the presiding judicial officer was a court commissioner, is tantamount to a stipulation to the authority of the commissioner to sit as a temporary judge].)</p>\n<p id=\"b983-10\">Because we conclude Edwards was tried at a location at which the superior court is authorized to hold sessions, his consent to the location of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1256\">*1256</page-number>the trial was unnecessary.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Accordingly, we need not address whether Edwards\u2019s conduct constituted a tantamount stipulation to trial at a municipal court location.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-4\">b. <em>Each of the Van Nuys county courts buildings is a superior court location.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b984-6\">Initially, we note the assignment of municipal court judges to sit as judges of the superior court falls within the Chief Justice\u2019s constitutional authority \u201cto expedite judicial business and to equalize the work of judges.\u201d (Cal. Const., art. VI, \u00a7 6; <em>People </em>v. <em>Najera </em>(1979) 88 Cal.App.3d 930, 933 [152 Cal.Rptr. 124].) Therefore, it is beyond dispute Edwards was tried by a judge of the superior court.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-7\">The defect in the proceedings that Edwards seeks to exploit on appeal is the failure to obtain his consent to the <em>location </em>of the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-8\">This claim is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-9\">The Government Code provides each superior court shall hold its sessions at locations specified by ordinance adopted pursuant to section 69640 et seq., or at the county seat or other location provided by statute. (\u00a7 69741.)</p>\n<p id=\"b984-10\">By ordinance adopted pursuant to sections 69641, 69643, and 69645, the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors (the Board) divided the County of Los Angeles into 11 superior court districts. Section 69642 empowers the Board to designate one or more location within each district at which sessions of the superior court shall be held.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-11\">Pursuant thereto, the Board enacted ordinances specifying the location of sessions for each of the 11 superior court districts within the county. Generally, these ordinances direct that the sessions of the various districts of the Los Angeles Superior Court are to be held in a particular city within the county. For example, section 1.16.260 of the Los Angeles County Code (LACC) provides: \u201cThe sessions of the Superior Court in the West District shall be held in the city of Santa Monica.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b984-12\">With respect to the Northwest District, which is in issue here, the LACC provides in part: \u201cThe sessions of the Superior Court in the Northwest District shall be held in the city of Los Angeles at the Van Nuys County Courts Building.\u201d (LACC, \u00a7 1.16.270.)</p>\n<p id=\"b985-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1257\">*1257</page-number>The term \u201cVan Nuys County Courts Building\" is not defined. However, both the superior and municipal court buildings in Van Nuys are county court buildings.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-5\">We reach this conclusion because, like the superior courts, the municipal and justice courts are regulated with respect to local matters by the respective county boards of supervisors. <em>(Whittaker </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1968) 68 Cal.2d 357, 362 [66 Cal.Rptr. 710, 438 P.2d 358]; <em>County of Madera </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1974) 39 Cal.App.3d 665, 669 [114 Cal.Rptr. 283]; \u00a7 71040.)</p>\n<p id=\"b985-6\">The California Constitution directs the Legislature to divide each county into municipal court districts and, pursuant to this directive, the Legislature created a judicial district embracing the City of Los Angeles (\u00a7 72700) which is part of the Municipal Court of the County of Los Angeles (tit. 8, ch. 9, \u00a7 72600 et seq.).</p>\n<p id=\"b985-7\">Accordingly, the municipal, as well as the superior, courts located in the County of Los Angeles are county courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-8\">It follows that all of the court buildings in the County of Los Angeles in the area of the City of Los Angeles known as Van Nuys properly may be referred to as \u201cVan Nuys County Court Buildings.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Indeed, each of these buildings is dedicated to County of Los Angeles court business, and the court buildings have been constructed virtually next to each other. To interpret \u201cVan Nuys County Courts Building\u201d in any other fashion also would be inconsistent with the broad citywide location the Board has specified for every other superior court district.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-9\">Section 69753 therefore applies only when a superior court matter is transferred to a location at which sessions of the municipal or justice court are authorized but sessions of the superior court are not. In Los Angeles County there are numerous such locations including the cities of Alhambra, Avalon, Bellflower, Beverly Hills, Culver City, Downey, El Monte, Huntington Park, Inglewood, Monrovia, Redondo Beach, South Gate, West Covina, and Whittier, and the unincorporated portions of the county known as East Los Angeles, and the towns of Malibu, Calabasas, and Valencia. (See LACC, \u00a7\u00a7 1.20.270 through 1.20.500.)</p>\n<p id=\"b985-10\">It is therefore clear that, although Edwards was tried in a courtroom usually occupied by a division of the municipal court, the courtroom was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1258\">*1258</page-number>situated at a location the Board has designated as appropriate for sessions of the superior court. Section 69753 thus has no application here and Edwards\u2019s written consent to the location of the trial was not needed.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-4\">2. <em>The trial court\u2019s sanction for refusal to comply with its discovery order was improper but did not constitute reversible error.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b986-6\">Edwards contends the trial court improperly sanctioned his failure to comply with discovery by excluding certain defense evidence. Specifically, Edwards claims the trial court erroneously prevented him from proving he and Neil had been partners in a business which was operated from Neil\u2019s apartment, the property taken from the apartment had belonged to the partnership, and Edwards had been entitled to possession of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-7\">a. <em>The alleged partnership.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b986-8\">Edwards asserts the partnership defense is presaged by Neil\u2019s testimony at the preliminary hearing on July 23, 1991. At that hearing Neil admitted he and Edwards had operated a business together at a house they occupied before Neil moved into the Whitsett apartment and that in early 1989 he had signed an agreement drafted by Edwards respecting the business. The day after Neil signed the agreement Edwards terminated their personal relationship. Thereafter, Neil rented the Whitsett apartment and moved the business there.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-9\">Neil admitted that in early 1990 Edwards was still involved in the business, had a key to one of the two locks to the apartment and sometimes worked at the apartment when Neil was not there.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-10\">Edwards, appearing in propria persona at the preliminary hearing, asked Neil if he remembered the contract they signed that \u201cstated all the property, the T.V., the V.C.R., the stereo, the phone, the beds, all of the things we bought for the business or for oursel[ves] was to be turned over to the business, that the individual who paid for the property would be reimbursed from the business?\u201d Neil admitted they had entered into a written agreement but denied it had so stated; Neil testified the agreement covered only property \u201cthat was business related that could be used for the business\u2014 there is no way a V.C.R. and a T.V. could be used for the business I conduct.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b986-11\">At that juncture, Edwards advised the trial court he had the written agreement and it would show they had so agreed. However, Neil stated that in June of 1990 Edwards signed a second written agreement in which he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1259\">*1259</page-number>promised to leave Neil alone and acknowledged that the business belonged solely to Neil.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-5\">b. <em>Relevant statutory provisions and discovery proceedings.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b987-6\">On June 5, 1990, the electorate adopted Proposition 115, the \u201cCrime Victims Justice Reform Act,\u201d which, inter alia, mandated reciprocal discovery in criminal matters. <em>(Izazaga </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1991) 54 Cal.3d 356, 363 [285 Cal.Rptr. 231, 815 P.2d 304].) Pursuant to the discovery provisions enacted with the passage of Proposition 115, the People gave Edwards notice in the information they sought informal discovery pursuant to Penal Code sections 1054.3 and 1054.5, subdivision (b).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b987-7\">This case trailed from day to day in a master calendar courtroom. During this time Edwards repeatedly sought dismissal of the charges based upon Neil\u2019s admission at the preliminary hearing of the existence of a partnership agreement between them. The trial court denied the motions.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b987-8\">On October 1, 1991, Edwards sought discovery of numerous items from the People. On the following day the prosecutor asked Edwards to produce all documents he intended to use during trial including the partnership agreement. The trial court asked Edwards if he had those documents and Edwards responded, \u201cThe documents, contracts and so forth are housed with [Neil].\u201d The trial court told Edwards to make copies of the documents he had and bring them to court the next day. Edwards stated he would.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-9\">On October 3, 1991, Edwards advised the trial court the partnership agreement was in the possession of his private investigator and Edwards would \u201chave that for [the People] tomorrow.\u201d After a recess during which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1260\">*1260</page-number>Edwards and the prosecutor discussed possible disposition of the case without trial, Edwards again indicated he had the partnership agreement and it would be available the next day.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-4\">On October 4, 1991, Edwards again sought dismissal based upon the failure of the People to demonstrate a dissolution of the partnership. After the trial court denied the motion, Edwards stated the \u201cpartnership agreement was a lost document.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b988-5\">The trial court admonished Edwards, \u201cIf you don\u2019t turn it over today and you have it, you are not going to be able to use it at trial.\u201d Edwards responded Neil already had admitted the existence of a partnership. The trial court told Edwards, \u201c[T]he point is you said you had a partnership agreement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b988-6\">On October 7, 1991, the trial court once more asked Edwards to produce the partnership agreement and Edwards again stated the document had been lost. The trial court ruled Edwards could not introduce evidence of the partnership at trial because he had failed to comply with discovery. \u201cWe gave you a whole week every day.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b988-7\">When the matter was sent out for trial before a judge other than the one who had imposed the discovery sanction, the prosecutor referred the trial court to a minute order in the file which stated: \u201cCourt finds defendant has failed to comply with discovery re: . . . partnership therefore defendant is not to present any evidence re: partnership.\u201d After reading the minute order the trial court stated, \u201cOkay.- That ruling has been made. I\u2019ll stand by that ruling.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b988-8\">c. <em>Edwards\u2019s contentions.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b988-9\">Edwards asserts: (1) the People failed to make an informal request for discovery and the information\u2019s nonspecific request did not comply with the statutory command the People ask opposing counsel for the desired materials; (2) the trial court did not make a discovery order before imposing sanctions; (3) the trial court improperly imposed the harshest possible sanction without considering lesser sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-10\">Edwards\u2019s first and second contentions clearly are without merit. The record demonstrates the People repeatedly sought discovery of the partnership agreement and the trial court directed Edwards to produce it. Moreover, by agreeing to produce the document, Edwards acquiesced in the trial court\u2019s order. Edwards therefore has waived any procedural objection which might <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1261\">*1261</page-number>have been interposed prior to trial based upon the manner of the request or the trial court\u2019s issuance of a discovery order without first allowing Edwards 15 days to respond to informal discovery as required by section 1054.5, subdivision (b). (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Walker </em>(1991) 54 Cal.3d 1013, 1024 [1 Cal.Rptr.2d 902, 819 P.2d 861]; <em>Doers </em>v. <em>Golden Gate Bridge etc. Dist. </em>(1979) 23 Cal.3d 180, 184-185, fn. 1 [151 Cal.Rptr. 837, 588 P.2d 1261].)</p>\n<p id=\"b989-5\">We next turn to the propriety of the sanction imposed by the trial court.  Because preclusion sanctions implicate substantial federal constitutional rights, we look to the United States Supreme Court to establish the minimal requirements for imposition of such a sanction. Additionally, given the recent enactment of California\u2019s reciprocal discovery statutes, we consider decisions of the federal courts for guidance in this area.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-6\">d. <em>Preclusion sanctions are drastic and must be used sparingly.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b989-7\">Prior to 1988, there was a split in the federal courts as to whether a <em>preclusion sanction </em>could be imposed against a criminal defendant solely as a sanction to enforce discovery rules or orders. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Davis </em>(5th Cir. 1981) 639 F.2d 239, 242-243, held such a sanction could not be imposed. Other jurisdictions employed a balancing test. (See <em>Fendler </em>v. <em>Goldsmith </em>(9th Cir. 1983) 728 F.2d 1181, 1185-1187 and authority cited there.)  <em>Davis, </em>and the commentators who adopted its view, reasoned a preclusion sanction (1) violated the fundamental right to present a defense, (2) was unrelated to the probative value of the evidence excluded, and (3) ignored the fact the sanction would be borne by a blameless criminal defendant rather than an incompetent or negligent attorney. <em>(Fendler </em>v. <em>Goldsmith, supra, </em>at pp. 1185-1187.)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b989-8\">The United States Supreme Court settled this conflict in <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Illinois, supra, </em>484 U.S. 400, and upheld a preclusion sanction imposed against a criminal defendant. In <em>Taylor </em>the accused\u2019s counsel failed to disclose, pursuant to an Illinois notice-of-alibi statute, the name of a defense witness despite the fact counsel had been aware of the witness a week before trial and had added other names to the defense witness list shortly before trial. The undisclosed witness testified outside the presence of the jury he had seen the victim with weapons prior to the alleged offense and had warned the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1262\">*1262</page-number>defendant. However, on cross-examination the witness admitted he had not met the defendant until two years after the incident. The trial court expressed \u201c \u2018a great deal of doubt. . . as to the veracity of\u2019 \u201d the witness and excluded his testimony. <em>(Taylor </em>v. <em>Illinois, supra, </em>484 U.S. at p. 405 [98 L.Ed.2d at p. 808].)</p>\n<p id=\"b990-4\"><em>Taylor </em>stated: \u201cIt is elementary, of course, that a trial court may not ignore the fundamental character of the defendant\u2019s right to offer the testimony of witnesses in his [or her] favor. But the mere invocation of that right cannot automatically and invariably outweigh countervailing public interests. The integrity of the adversary process, which depends both on the presentation of reliable evidence and the rejection of unreliable evidence, the interest in the fair and efficient administration of justice, and the potential prejudice to the truth-determining function of the trial process must also weigh in the balance. [Fn. omitted.]\u201d <em>(Taylor </em>v. <em>Illinois, supra, </em>484 U.S. at pp. 414-415 [98 L.Ed.2d at p. 814].)</p>\n<p id=\"b990-5\"><em>Taylor </em>concluded the preclusion sanction was justified in that case because the accused deliberately had violated the discovery order to gain a tactical advantage and the proffered evidence likely had been fabricated. <em>(Taylor </em>v. <em>Illinois, supra, </em>484 U.S. at p. 417 [98 L.Ed.2d at pp. 815-816].)</p>\n<p id=\"b990-6\">In <em>Michigan </em>v. <em>Lucas </em>(1991) 500 U.S. 145 [114 L.Ed.2d 205, 111 S.Ct. 1743], the United States Supreme Court again held a preclusion sanction may be imposed against a criminal defendant in a proper circumstance, but emphasized such cases are the exception rather than the rule. There, the accused in a rape prosecution failed to give statutorily required notice of his intent to introduce evidence of prior sexual contact between himself and the victim. As a discovery sanction, the trial court excluded the evidence at trial. The state appellate court reversed and adopted a per se rule that notice requirements could never be used to preclude evidence of past sexual conduct between a rape victim and a criminal defendant. The Supreme Court held the per se rule improper in that preclusion may be an acceptable sanction in some cases but noted that \u201c[Restrictions on a criminal defendant\u2019s rights to confront adverse witnesses and to present evidence \u2018may not be arbitrary or disproportionate to the purposes they are designed to serve.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Michigan </em>v. <em>Lucas, supra, </em>500 U.S. at p__[114 L.Ed.2d at p. 213].)</p>\n<p id=\"b990-9\">The high court also clarified <em>Taylor </em>and stated: \u201cWe did not hold in <em>Taylor </em>that preclusion is permissible every time a discovery rule is violated. Rattier, we acknowledged that alternative sanctions would be \u2018adequate and appropriate in most cases.\u2019 [Citation.] We stated explicitly, however that there could be circumstances in which preclusion was justified because a less <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1263\">*1263</page-number>severe penalty \u2018would perpetuate rather than limit the prejudice to the State and the harm to the adversary process.\u2019 [Citation.] <em>Taylor, </em>we concluded, was such a case. The trial court found Taylor\u2019s discovery violation amounted to <em>\u2018willful </em>misconduct\u2019 and was designed to obtain <em>\u2018a tactical </em>advantage.\u2019 [Citation.] Based on these findings, we determined that, \u2018[rjegardless of whether prejudice to the prosecution could have been avoided\u2019 by a lesser penalty, \u2018the severest sanction [wa]s appropriate.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Michigan </em>v. <em>Lucas, supra, </em>500 U.S. at p__[114 L.Ed.2d at p. 214], italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b991-5\">We interpret these authorities to instruct that preclusion sanctions may be imposed against a criminal defendant only for the most egregious discovery abuse. Specifically, such sanctions should be reserved to those cases in which the record demonstrates a willful and deliberate violation which was motivated by a desire to obtain a tactical advantage at trial such as the plan to present fabricated testimony in <em>Taylor.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b991-6\">e. <em>It is unclear whether Edwards willfully failed to comply with the discovery order in an effort to gain a tactical advantage at trial.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b991-8\">The record in this case does not demonstrate Edwards willfully and deliberately refused to produce the agreement. Although such an inference could be drawn, the record also reasonably could be interpreted so as to conclude that Edwards misrepresented possession of the agreement in order to enhance the possibility the trial court would grant his motions to dismiss the case based upon the existence of the partnership, or to gain some perceived leverage in plea bargain negotiations with the People. That is, Edwards may have been bluffing.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-9\">Additionally, it is possible Edwards had the document and lost it, or that he overestimated his ability to locate it.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-10\">The trial court did not make a factual finding as to what it believed had occurred or ask Edwards to explain the circumstances under which the agreement had been lost.  Where the failure to comply with a discovery order is susceptible of contrary inferences on the issue of willfulness, and no attempt is made by the trial court to establish the facts underlying the violation, imposition of a preclusion sanction is an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-11\">Further, Edwards would have enjoyed a tactical advantage at trial only if he willfully had refused to produce the agreement. In that circumstance he would have been able to cross-examine Neil about the agreement without fear of being contradicted by the document itself. However, in none of the alternate explanations for the failure to produce the agreement did Edwards obtain any tactical advantage <em>at trial.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b992-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1264\">*1264</page-number>In sum, the preclusion sanction was not supported by a showing of willful and deliberate discovery abuse calculated to obtain a tactical advantage at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-4\">f. <em>Even where an intentional violation is shown, the discovery statute allows use of a preclusion sanction only as a last resort.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b992-6\">Under federal law, the factors to be considered in determining the appropriate remedy for discovery violations include: (1) the effectiveness of less severe sanctions, (2) the impact of preclusion on the evidence at trial and the outcome of the case, (3) the extent of prosecutorial surprise or prejudice, and (4) whether the violation was willful. <em>(Taylor </em>v. <em>Illinois, supra, </em>484 U.S. at p. 415, fn. 19 [98 L.Ed.2d at p. 814] citing <em>Fendler </em>v. <em>Goldsmith, supra, </em>728 F.2d at pp. 1188-1190.)</p>\n<p id=\"b992-7\">Under California\u2019s reciprocal discovery scheme, there is an additional statutory requirement. Subdivision (c) of Penal Code section 1054.5 allows a trial court to preclude the testimony of a witness <em>\u201conly </em>if all other sanctions have been exhausted.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b992-8\">The sanction imposed by the trial court here did not preclude the entire testimony of any one witness. Rather, it precluded the testimony of <em>all </em>witnesses respecting the partnership theory of defense. The fact the trial court excluded an entire category of evidence rather than the testimony of a particular witness is inconsequential. Both sanctions infringe constitutionally protected rights of a criminal defendant. Indeed, the exclusion of an entire class of evidence in many instances is more offensive than the exclusion of the testimony of a witness. The former limits the accused\u2019s right to confront and cross-examine adverse witnesses as well as the right to right to compel the attendance of favorable witnesses and the right to produce evidence in one\u2019s own behalf. Either type of order is a preclusion sanction. Accordingly, the trial court\u2019s order had to comply with the dictate of Penal Code section 1054.5, subdivision (c). Thus, even if the facts of this case had demonstrated a willful violation of the trial court\u2019s discovery order, the trial court nonetheless had a statutory duty to exhaust all other sanctions before precluding the production of defense evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-9\">Penal Code section 1054.5, subdivision (b), suggests several discovery sanctions a trial court may impose \u201cincluding, but not limited to, immediate disclosure, contempt proceedings, delaying or prohibiting the testimony of a witness or the presentation of real evidence, continuance of the matter, or any other lawful order. Further, the court may advise the jury of any failure or refusal to disclose and of any untimely disclosure.\u201d The statutory duty to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1265\">*1265</page-number>exhaust all other sanctions requires a trial court to consider these endorsed sanctions before imposing a preclusion sanction.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-5\">Here, no such attempt was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-6\">g. <em>Consideration of less restrictive alternatives.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b993-7\">Consideration of the sanctions set forth in the statute reveals most would have been ineffective here. Immediate disclosure was not available and contempt proceedings would have had no effect on Edwards as he already was in custody and thus had no fear of incarceration. There was no suggestion a continuance would have allowed Edwards to locate the agreement and, in any event, Edwards refused to waive time for trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-8\">Similarly ineffective would have been an order preventing Edwards from introducing the written agreement at trial. If Edwards willfully had suppressed the agreement, an order precluding its introduction into evidence would have rewarded his failure to comply with discovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-9\">Finally, consistent with the last sentence of Penal Code section 1054.5, subdivision (b), the trial court might have allowed Edwards to present evidence relating to the partnership and thereafter instructed the jury Edwards had admitted possession of the partnership agreement but had failed to produce it when ordered to do so. This sanction would have served the object of discovery in that it would have allowed the People to argue Edwards had concealed the document because its terms were not favorable to him. At the same time, such a sanction would not have infringed Edwards\u2019s right to present a defense and would have permitted him to attempt to explain his failure to produce the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-10\">Moreover, in the event the record had demonstrated Edwards intentionally had concealed the agreement, the trial court could have further instructed the jury to infer the terms of the agreement were adverse to Edwards\u2019s position. (See, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Zamora </em>(1980) 28 Cal.3d 88, 103 [167 Cal.Rptr. 573, 615 P.2d 1361].)</p>\n<p id=\"b993-11\">In light of the effectiveness of these less restrictive alternatives, the trial court\u2019s preclusion sanction was improper under California law even if the violation had been shown to be willful and perpetrated in order to gain a tactical advantage at trial. That is, even if a preclusion sanction would have been proper under <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Illinois, supra, </em>484 U. S. 400, and <em>Michigan </em>v. <em>Lucas, supra, </em>114 L.Ed.2d 205, the trial court also had to comply with the California discovery scheme which permits preclusion \u201conly if all other sanctions have been exhausted.\u201d (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1054.5, subd, (c).)</p>\n<p id=\"b994-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1266\">*1266</page-number>For all the foregoing reasons, the trial court\u2019s preclusion sanction was inappropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-4\">h. <em>The error was harmless.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b994-5\">Because the order precluding Edwards\u2019s partnership defense affected his substantial constitutional rights, we must determine whether the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>(Chapman </em>v. <em>California </em>(1967) 386 U.S. 18 [17 L.Ed.2d 705, 87 S.Ct. 824, 24 A.L.R.3d 1065]; <em>Fendler </em>v. <em>Goldsmith, supra, </em>728 F.2d at p. 1190.) We conclude the sanction had no impact on the outcome of this case. <em>(U.S. </em>v. <em>Alexander </em>(5th Cir. 1989) 869 F.2d 808, 811-812.)</p>\n<p id=\"b994-6\">There was overwhelming evidence Edwards had burglarized the Whitsett apartment. Edwards\u2019s partnership defense was improbable and, even if believed, established a claim only to Neil\u2019s television and videocassette recorder. It would not have constituted a defense to the crimes arising out of the taking of Neil\u2019s credit cards and money or the theft of Michael\u2019s property.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-7\">Edwards\u2019s strongest defense was the assertion he and Neil had acquired the property taken in the burglary in the course of their personal relationship, a theory he advanced at trial. Because the jury rejected Edwards\u2019s claim of personal entitlement to the property, the weaker claim of a business-based right to the property similarly would have failed.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-8\">Moreover, Edwards\u2019s partnership defense would have been undermined by rebuttal evidence related to a second agreement signed in June of 1990, alluded to by Neil at the preliminary hearing, by which Edwards agreed to stay away from Neil and acknowledged the business was Neil\u2019s sole property.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-9\">Additionally, notwithstanding the trial court\u2019s order, evidence concerning the business relationship between Edwards and Neil came into the record on numerous occasions. Ifiis occurred primarily because the preclusion order had been made by the master calender judge and the trial court, although willing to abide by it, was not entirely comfortable with the prospect of precluding the presentation of defense evidence. Thus, the trial court uniformly erred in favor of allowing Edwards leeway in the questioning of witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-10\">For these reasons, we conclude beyond a reasonable doubt the trial court\u2019s discovery sanction did not affect the result of Edwards\u2019s trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1267\">*1267</page-number>Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b995-5\">Edwards was tried at a location at which the superior court is authorized to conduct sessions and thus, his consent to the location of trial was not required.
