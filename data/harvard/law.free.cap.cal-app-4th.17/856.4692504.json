Insureds claim language in a \u201cpollution exclusion\u201d clause is ambiguous, and should be construed in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"858\">*858</page-number>favor of Insureds.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The trial court found the language unambiguous, and granted summary judgment in favor of Insurer. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-4\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">In December 1985, the Insureds purchased the Parkway Car Wash in Escondido, a facility that also sold gasoline. The car wash included three underground gasoline storage tanks which were connected to the gasoline pumps. Insureds purchased a comprehensive liability policy for the business which was issued by Insurer.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-6\">The policy issued to Insureds by Insurer provided for liability coverage and defense of lawsuits arising from an \u201coccurrence\u201d or \u201can event, or series of events, including injurious exposure to conditions, proximately caused by an act or omission of the insured\u201d resulting in damages which are \u201cneither expected nor intended\u201d by Insureds.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-7\">The policy contained a standard \u201cpollution exclusion\u201d clause limiting coverage. The clause excluded coverage for property damage \u201carising out of the discharge, dispersal, release or escape of . . . liquids or . . . waste materials or other . . . contaminants . . . into or upon the land, ... but this exclusion does not apply if such discharge, dispersal, release or escape is sudden and accidental.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b684-8\">The policy further defined \u201caccidental\u201d as \u201cneither expected nor intended by the insured,\u201d and defined \u201csudden\" as \u201cnot continuous or repeated in nature.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b684-9\">The \u201coccurrence\u201d here is long-term leakage of gasoline from one underground storage tank on the property purchased by Insureds in December 1985. Insureds did not discover the leakage until September 1986. While the leakage may have been going on since before Insureds purchased the property, it was stipulated below that the leakage had been going on for at least 60 days.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-10\">The trial court determined the word \u201csudden\u201d was not ambiguous, that it had a temporal meaning, and that a leak of at least 60 days\u2019 duration was \u201cclearly not sudden, under a reasonable interpretation of that term.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b685-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"859\">*859</page-number>Having determined that the exception to the pollution exclusion clause did not apply to the leakage in this case, the court entered summary judgment for Insurer.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-4\">Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">The appeal presents for review a decision of the trial court on a pure question of law, the interpretation of the language in an insurance policy. We thus determine the question de novo, under a nondeferential standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b685-7\">The California Supreme Court has provided guidance for construing insurance policy language in <em>AIU Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Superior </em>Court, supra, 51 Cal.3d at pages 821-822: \u201cUnder statutory rules of contract interpretation, the mutual intention of the parties at the time the contract is formed governs interpretation. (Civ. Code, \u00a7 1636.) Such intent is to be inferred, if possible, solely from the written provisions of the contract. <em>(Id., </em>\u00a7 1639.) The \u2018clear and explicit\u2019 meaning of these provisions, interpreted in their \u2018ordinary and popular sense,\u2019 unless \u2018used by the parties in a technical sense or a special meaning is given to them by usage\u2019 <em>(id., </em>\u00a7 1644), controls judicial interpretation. <em>(Id., </em>\u00a7 1638.) Thus, if the meaning a layperson would ascribe to contract language is not ambiguous, we apply that meaning.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b685-8\">Here, of course, the parties clearly intended, as the policy language unambiguously states, that \u201cdischarge, dispersal, release or escape of . . . liquids or . . . waste materials or other . . . contaminants . . . into or upon the land\u201d would be <em>excluded </em>from coverage. The exception to this exclusion is a case where the discharge is \u201csudden and accidental.\u201d In other words, precisely the situation here involved, a leakage of extended duration, must be deemed to have been intentionally excluded from coverage by the parties.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b685-9\">The principles set forth in <em>AIU </em>have been followed in the recent case of <em>Shell Oil Co. </em>v. <em>Winterthur Swiss Ins. Co., supra, </em>12 Cal.App.4th 715. That case, involving coverage for pollution extending for over 30 years at the Rocky Mountain Arsenal in Colorado, also involved policy language setting forth a \u201cpollution exclusion.\u201d Some of the policies at issue \u201cstated that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"860\">*860</page-number>\u2018exclusion does not apply if such discharge, dispersal, release or escape is <em>sudden and </em>accidental.\u2019 (Italics added.)\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 753.)</p>\n<p id=\"b686-4\">There, the insureds argued, as here, \u201cthat \u2018sudden\u2019 is ambiguous and that we should construe it to cover unexpected or unintended events <em>without any temporal </em>limitation.\u201d <em>(Shell Oil Co. </em>v. <em>Winterthur Swiss Ins. Co., supra, </em>12 Cal.App.4th at p. 752, italics added.) The court rejected that assertion, and held instead that \u201cin the phrase, \u2018sudden and accidental,\u2019 \u2018accidental\u2019 conveys the sense of an unexpected and unintended event, while \u2018sudden\u2019 conveys the sense of an unexpected event that is abrupt or immediate in nature. \u2018Sudden and accidental\u2019 is not ambiguous if we give the words their full significance. A court should not make a phrase ambiguous by unreasonably truncating a word\u2019s meaning.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>(Id. </em>at p. 755.)</p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">Just as the <em>Shell Oil </em>court refused to create ambiguity in the phrase \u201csudden and accidental,\u201d there is no need for us to create ambiguity by \u201cunreasonably truncating\u201d the meaning of the single word \u201csudden.\u201d This is particularly true here, as distinguished from the other cases discussed in which the policy itself does not define the term used. In this case, we need not go outside the policy language, for the policy itself <em>does </em>define \u201csudden\u201d as \u201cnot continuous.\u201d Any continuous event, whether it be of 30 years\u2019 or 2 months\u2019 duration, is simply not \u201csudden.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b686-6\">In this case, Insureds purchased an insurance policy with language expressly <em>precluding </em>coverage for pollution which was <em>continuous </em>rather than sudden. There is no issue as to the continuous nature of the pollution here.  \u201c[A] court that is faced with an argument for coverage based on assertedly ambiguous policy language must first attempt to determine whether coverage is consistent with the insured\u2019s objectively reasonable expectations. In so doing, the court must interpret the language in context, with regard to its intended function in the policy.\u201d <em>(Bank of the West </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1992) 2 Cal.4th 1254, 1265 [10 Cal.Rptr.2d 538, 833 P.2d 545].)</p>\n<p id=\"b686-7\">Here, Insurer clearly intended to exclude all coverage for pollution except in the case of a \u201csudden\u201d accident. If the underground storage tank had exploded (the \u201cclassical accident\u201d envisaged by the drafter) causing pollution damage to surrounding property, the Insureds\u2019 expectation of coverage would be \u201cobjectively reasonable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b687-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"861\">*861</page-number>In this case, however, the pollution process was both continuous and long-term, and thus Insureds could not have reasonably expected coverage for an event which was <em>expressly </em>excluded therefrom. The trial court\u2019s conclusion that the word \u201csudden\u201d has a temporal meaning was correct, as it coincides with \u201cthe meaning a layperson would ascribe\u201d to the contract language in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-4\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">The judgment is affirmed. Respondent to recover costs on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"A0v\">Kremer, P. J., and Froehlich, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-6\">Appellants\u2019 petition for review by the Supreme Court was denied November 17, 1993.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b684-11\">This question has been frequently litigated in appellate courts across the country, and there are numerous cases on both sides of the issue. (See, e.g., the authorities reviewed in <em>Shell Oil Co. </em>v. <em>Winterthur Swiss Ins. Co. </em>(1993) 12 Cal.App.4th 715, 751-756 [15 Cal.Rptr.2d 815].) Insureds in particular cite to numerous federal district court cases \u201cpurporting to apply state law.\u201d <em>(AIU Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1990) 51 Cal.3d 807, 820 [274 Cal.Rptr. 820, 799 P.2d 1253].) We need not further refer to these cases, however, as we find California authority, particularly <em>Shell Oil, </em>adequate to resolve the issue before us.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b685-10\">As Id Insurer this is clearly correct, as the principal draftsman of the pollution exclusion clause has stated it was intended to wholly eliminate coverage for pollution except in the case of a \u201cclassical accident,\u201d which he defined as a \u201csudden, boom-type accident\u201d such as an explosion. (Williams, <em>Intent of the Drafters: The Pollution Exclusion And The Insurance Commissioner Documents </em>in Environmental and Toxic Tort Claims Insurance Coverage in 1990 and Beyond (1990) pp. 25-26. [Author is the editor.])</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b686-8\">Insureds point to language in <em>Shell Oil </em>opining that \u201ca sudden and accidental discharge of a dangerous pollutant could continue unabated for some period because of a negligent failure to discover it, technical problems or a lack of resources that delay curtailment, or some other circumstance. Liability from such an event could well be covered.\" <em>(Shell Oil Co. </em>v. <em>Winterthur Swiss Ins. Co., supra, </em>12 Cal.App.4th at p. 756.) This observation is dicta, rather than a holding, and in any event has no application to the facts of the matter before us.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
