Introduction</p>\n<p id=\"b1309-10\">Insurance claims arising out of leaking underground storage tanks raise the question of who will pay for the cleanup of millions of tons of toxic waste produced in the United States since World War II. This problem has sparked a legal war that has raged in both federal and state courts from Maine to California. (See <em>Northern Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Aardvark Associates </em>(3d Cir. 1991) 942 F.2d 189, 191; see also <em>Avondale Industries, Inc. </em>v. <em>Travelers Indent. Co. </em>(2d Cir. 1989) 887 F.2d 1200, 1201 [\u201cthe vast carelessness that created the conundrum of hazardous waste . . . will not be quickly or easily remedied\u201d].) Much of the strife has focused on the precise issue of whether the \u201csudden and accidental\u201d exception to the pollution exclusion contained in the 1973 version of the standard comprehensive general liability insurance policy (CGL) allows for coverage for pollution which escaped gradually.</p>\n<p id=\"b1309-11\">This case, like many throughout the country, involves a claim for expenses to clean up pollutants which leaked from rusted and corroded underground storage tanks. The trial judge found the release of the pollutants was gradual. He therefore held, among other things, that the pollution exclusion precluded coverage. We agree and affirm the judgment in favor of the insurer. Gradual is the opposite of sudden.</p>\n<p id=\"b1309-12\">II. Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b1309-13\">In August 1984 ACL Technologies purchased some property in an industrial section of Santa Ana. About the same time the company obtained a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1778\">*1778</page-number>CGL policy from Northbrook Property and Casualty Insurance Company, with tiie policy period from September 28, 1984, to September 28, 1985. Unknown to ACL at the time, the property contained underground storage tanks which had been used to store hazardous substances for over two decades.</p>\n<p id=\"b1310-4\">ACL first learned of the tanks in late 1985 or early 1986 when the Santa Ana Fire Department ordered the company to \u201cestablish testing conditions\u201d on the tanks or remove them. City officials later explained that a city ordinance required all underground storage tanks be monitored and used or declared out of service and removed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1310-5\">In January, February, and April 1988 the tanks were removed. They were rusted and had many small holes (largest about an inch in diameter); a particularly large (12,000-gallon) tank had a split seam about an inch and one-half long at the junction of the end and side plates. Corrosion was visible in the area of the split. Photographs were taken of the newly removed tanks.</p>\n<p id=\"b1310-6\">Soil samples from the area around the tanks showed contamination. The city and the California Regional Water Quality Control Board then ordered ACL to develop a cleanup plan. ACL presented Northbrook with a claim for the cost of the cleanup, which Northbrook denied. ACL then filed this lawsuit for breach of contract and declaratory relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b1310-7\">The CGL policy issued by Northbrook contained this exclusion: \u201cThis part does not insure: [f] (f) bodily injury or property damage arising out of the discharge, dispersal, release or escape of smoke, vapors, soot, fumes, acids, alkalis, toxic chemicals, liquids or gases, waste materials or other irritants, contaminants or pollutants into or upon land, the atmosphere or any water course or body of water; but this exclusion does not apply if such discharge, dispersal, release or escape is sudden and accidental.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1310-8\">Trial was to the court, which specifically found that the pollutants escaped through leaks caused by corrosion, and that this corrosion occurred gradually over an \u201cextended\u201d period of time. Accordingly, the court concluded that any coverage otherwise provided by the policy was excluded under the policy\u2019s pollution exclusion. As the judge put it, \u201c[t]he word \u2018sudden\u2019 is directed at rupture or human error, an explosion, a spill, something which occurs abruptly, and the term is used to specifically exclude the situation which happens in this case, and that is the corrosion over an extended period of time of the pipes or tanks in the ground which could actually cause a leaking situation over several years, such as in this case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1311-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1779\">*1779</page-number>ACL now appeals from the ensuing judgment.1<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1311-5\">III. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b1311-6\">A. <em>Gradual Is the Opposite of Sudden</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1311-7\">The Supreme Courts of Massachusetts,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Michigan,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> North Carolina,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and Ohio<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> have held that the word \u201csudden\u201d or the phrase \u201csudden and accidental\u201d as used in the 1973 pollution exclusion did not allow for liability coverage arising from gradual pollution, with state intermediate appellate courts and federal courts construing state law unanimously taking the same position in Indiana,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Kansas,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Kentucky,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> New Hampshire,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Pennsylvania,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1780\">*1780</page-number>South Carolina,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Tennessee,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and Utah.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> With our opinion today, and the recent decision in <em>Shell Oil Co. </em>v. <em>Winterthur Swiss Ins. Co. </em>(1993) 12 Cal.App.4th 715, 752 [15 Cal.Rptr.2d 815] (\u201c <em>\u2018Sudden' Events Start Abruptly''), </em>California should be added to this list.</p>\n<p id=\"b1312-4\">On the other hand, state Supreme Courts in Colorado,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Georgia,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Illinois,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> West Virginia,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> and Wisconsin<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> have held the words allowed for coverage of gradual pollution as long as the pollution was unintended and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1781\">*1781</page-number>unexpected. State intermediate appellate courts and federal courts construing state law appear united on the same result in Delaware,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Minnesota,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> New Jersey <footnotemark>21</footnotemark> and Washington.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1314-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1782\">*1782</page-number>Courts have divided on the subject in Florida,<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> with no definitive word yet from its state Supreme Court.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Also, while not directly considering the gradual-sudden dichotomy, the state high courts of New York<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> and Iowa<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> have treated the \u201caccidental\u201d component of the pollution exclusion in such a way as to indicate that they probably will construe \u201csudden\u201d as unambiguous. Dicta from state intermediate appellate courts in Oregon<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> and Maryland<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> indicate that those jurisdictions would probably also hold the same way. On the other hand, dicta from the state Supreme Courts of Arkansas,<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> and Alaska<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> lean in the opposite direction. And there is a comparatively early decision from the state Supreme Court of Maine, which, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1783\">*1783</page-number>while it is sometimes put in the sudden-is-ambiguous column, did not address the gradual-sudden dichotomy and contains something for both sides.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> The same may be said for a federal district court decision out of Missouri.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1315-5\">In light of the foregoing, it would appear that claims by one side or the other for possession of the \u201cmajority rule\u201d are at present premature.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark>\n                   The best we can do is note how the jurisdictions are divided as we write in the late spring and summer of 1993.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1315-6\">Courts on both sides of the divide have generally joined issue on the problem of the multiple shades of meaning inherent in the word \u201csudden.\u201d (See Holmes, <em>The Theory of Legal Interpretation </em>(1899) 12 Harv. L. Rev. 417 [\u201cA word generally has several meanings, even in the dictionary. You have to consider the sentence in which it stands to decide which of those meanings it bears in the particular case, and very likely will see that it there has a shade of significance more refined than any given in the wordbook.\u201d], quoted in <em>Shell Oil, supra, </em>12 Cal.App.4th at p. 737.) As ACL and amicus <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1784\">*1784</page-number>curiae Montrose Chemical Company remind us, \u201csudden\u201d (at least in some contexts) can mean \u201cunexpected.\u201d<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> Courts holding in favor of coverage have tended to emphasize that some dictionary definitions of the word do not necessarily convey a sense of abruptness. (See, e.g., <em>New Castle, supra, </em>933 F.2d at 1193 (\u201cthe word has more than one reasonable definition\u201d).)<footnotemark>36</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1316-4\">While ACL and Montrose Chemical Company have emphasized that this court is not bound by the recent decision in <em>Shell Oil Co. </em>v. <em>Winterthur Swiss Ins. Co., supra, </em>12 Cal.App.4th 715, we believe that <em>Shell Oil </em>was correctly decided. It followed the basic framework for interpreting insurance contracts articulated by our Supreme Court in <em>Bank of the West </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1992) 2 Cal.4th 1254, 1264-1265 [10 Cal.Rptr.2d 538, 833 P.2d 545] and <em>AIU Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1990) 51 Cal.3d 807, 822 [274 Cal.Rptr. 820, 799 P.2d 1253]. Using this framework, there is no way that we could come to any other conclusion than that reached in the <em>Shell Oil </em>decision: the \u201csudden and accidental\u201d language in the CGL pollution exclusion does not allow for coverage for gradual pollution.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> Here is that framework:  \u201cIf contractual language is clear and explicit, it governs.\u201d <em>(Bank of the West, supra, </em>2 Cal.4th at p. 1264, citing Civ. Code, \u00a7 1638; <em>AIU, supra, </em>51 Cal.3d at p. 822 [the intent of the parties \u201cis to be inferred, if possible, solely from the written provisions of the contract.... Thus, if the meaning a layperson would ascribe to contract language is not ambiguous, we apply that meaning\u201d]; see <em>Shell Oil, supra, </em>12 Cal.App.4th at p. 737 [\u201cThe parties\u2019 intent is found, if possible, solely in the contract\u2019s written provisions.\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1316-5\">If there is ambiguity in a promise, its terms must be \u201c \u2018interpreted in the sense in which the promisor believed, at the time of making it, that the promisee understood it.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Bank of the West, supra, </em>2 Cal.4th at pp. 1264-1265, quoting Civ. Code, \u00a7 1649; <em>AIU, supra, </em>51 Cal.3d at p. 822 [\u201cIf there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1785\">*1785</page-number>is ambiguity, however, it is [to be] resolved by interpreting the ambiguous provisions in the sense the promisor (i.e., the insurer) believed the promisee understood them at the time of formation.\u201d]; see <em>Shell Oil Co., supra, </em>12 Cal.App.4th at p. 737 [\u201cWhen particular policy language is ambiguous, it is interpreted in the sense the insurer believed the insured understood it at the time of formation.\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1317-5\">\u201cOnly\u201d if application of this last rule does not resolve the ambiguity should the courts \u201cthen\u201d resolve the ambiguity against the insurer. <em>(Bank of the West, supra, 2 </em>Cal.4th at p. 1265; <em>AIU, supra, </em>51 Cal.3d at p. 822 [\u201cIf application of this rule does not eliminate the ambiguity, ambiguous language is construed against the party who caused the uncertainty to exist.\u201d]; accord, <em>Shell Oil, supra, </em>12 Cal.App.4th at p. 737 [\u201cIf that principle cannot remove an ambiguity, as when there is no basis for a belief that the insured understood a term in a specific sense, then the ambiguity is construed against the party who caused the uncertainty to exist.\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1317-6\">Applying the <em>Bank of the West </em>and <em>AIU </em>framework, the first question is whether the contract language is \u201cclear and explicit\u201d as a layperson would understand it.  In deciding this question, we keep in mind that \u201c <em>\u2018language in a contract </em>must be construed in the context of that instrument as a whole, and in the circumstances of that case, and <em>cannot be found to be ambiguous in the </em>abstract.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Bank of the West, supra, 2 </em>Cal.4th at p. 1265, quoting <em>Producers Dairy Delivery Co. </em>v. <em>Sentry Ins. Co. </em>(1986) 41 Cal.3d 903, 916, fn. 7 [226 Cal.Rptr. 558, 718 P.2d 920], italics by the <em>Bank of the West </em>court.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1317-7\">The most immediate \u201ccontext\u201d for the word \u201csudden\u201d is its link, in the pollution exclusion, to the word \u201caccidental.\u201d Plainly, for there to be coverage (i.e., for the exclusion not to apply), the release must be both \u201csudden and accidental.\u201d If, in the context of the pollution exclusion, \u201csudden\u201d meant <em>merely </em>\u201cunexpected,\u201d then it would have no independent meaning, as the idea would also be subsumed within the word \u201caccidental.\u201d The word would be reduced to surplusage. In California, however, contracts \u2014even insurance contracts\u2014are construed to avoid rendering terms surplus-age. (E.g., <em>AIU, supra, </em>51 Cal.3d at p. 827 [declining to apply a definition of \u201cdamages\u201d which would render \u201credundant\u201d the phrase \u201clegally obligated to pay\u201d]; <em>Shell Oil, supra, </em>12 Cal.App.4th at p. 753 [\u201cThe way we define words should not produce redundancy . . . .\u201d]; <em>Stein </em>v. <em>International Ins. Co. </em>(1990) 217 Cal.App.3d 609, 613-614 [266 Cal.Rptr. 72] [distinguishing between \u201cclaims\u201d and \u201csuits\u201d to avoid redundancy]; <em>Mid-Century Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Bash </em>(1989) 211 Cal.App.3d 431, 438 [259 Cal.Rptr. 382] [\u201cTo interpret the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1786\">*1786</page-number>policy provision as respondent does would render the words \u2018financial responsibility\u2019 mere surplusage.\u201d]; <em>Southern Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Domino of California, Inc. </em>(1985) 173 Cal.App.3d 619, 624 [219 Cal.Rptr. 112] [rejecting policyholder interpretation that would render words \u201cof property\u201d redundant].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1318-4\">To avoid the surplusage problem, the Third Circuit turned cartwheels in <em>New Castle County </em>to extract a meaning for \u201csudden\u201d that was not \u201ccompletely synonymous\u201d with \u201caccidental.\u201d (See 933 F.2d at p. 1194 [\u201cWe believe that the word \u2018sudden,\u2019 even if defined to mean \u2018unexpected,\u2019 is not completely synonymous with the word \u2018accidental.\u2019 \u201d].)<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> The flaw in such an approach is that it strains the word accidental, wrenching the word from its natural embrace of the concept of unexpectedness. It is thus necessary, to give the word \u201csudden\u201d a definition severed from any idea of temporality and still not run afoul of the strictures against surplusage, to strip the concept of \u201caccident\u201d of one of its most common ideas, unexpectedness. This is contrary to both established canons and common sense. (See <em>Reserve Insurance Co. </em>v. <em>Pisciotta </em>(1982) 30 Cal.3d 800, 807 [180 Cal.Rptr. 628, 640 P.2d 764] [\u201cCourts will not adopt a strained or absurd interpretation in order to create an ambiguity where none exists.\u201d]; <em>Aim Insurance Co. </em>v. <em>Culcasi </em>(1991) 229 Cd.App.3d 209, 219 [280 Cal.Rptr. 766] [\u201cCourts, however, should not strain to find ambiguity where none reasonably exists.\u201d]; <em>Barrett </em>v. <em>Farmers Ins. Group </em>(1985) 174 Cal.App.3d 747, 752 [220 Cal.Rptr. 135] [\u201cCourts should not indulge in forced construction so as to cast upon the insurance company liability which it has not assumed.\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1318-5\">Even if, for the sake of argument, there is some \u201cabstract\u201d sense in which the word \u201csudden\u201d does not necessarily convey a temporal meaning, the context of its placement in the phrase \u201csudden and accidental\u201d necessarily conveys a temporal meaning. In the context of that phrase, the word <em>must, </em>if it is to be anything more than a hiccup in front of the word \u201caccidental,\u201d convey a \u201ctemporal\u201d meaning of immediacy, quickness, or abruptness.</p>\n<p id=\"b1318-6\">The best argument that can be adduced to meet the surplusage point is that insurance policies \u201croutinely use words that, while not strictly redundant, are somewhat synonymous.\u201d <em>(New Castle, supra, </em>933 F.2d at p. 1194.) So what, ACL asks rhetorically, if confining \u201csudden\u201d to \u201cunexpected\u201d results in a redundancy?</p>\n<p id=\"b1318-7\">The first answer, of course, is that defining terms in contracts to render them redundant is contrary to established principles of contract interpretation as laid down by our Supreme Court. As we have already shown, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1787\">*1787</page-number>antiredundancy principle extends to insurance contracts, including, as in <em>AIU </em>and <em>Shell Oil, </em>those involving questions of coverage for pollution.</p>\n<p id=\"b1319-5\">Additionally, the argument founders within the context of the so-called redundancies in the pollution exclusion itself. It is not enough that the meanings of two words, \u201csudden\u201d and \u201caccidental,\u201d overlap. Of course they overlap. The world is full of accidents which happen suddenly. The critical point, however, is that the interpretation ACL and Montrose Chemical Company proffer renders \u201csudden\u201d a mere subset of \u201caccidental,\u201d making it totally redundant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1319-6\">It is one thing for meanings of individual words to overlap. It is quite another to interpret them so that they add nothing in the context in which they are used. In the earlier portion of the pollution exclusion, for example, it is undoubtedly true that the meanings of the words \u201cdischarge, dispersal, release or escape\u201d overlap. But they also each convey a different nuance of meaning bearing on just exactly how \u201cpollution\u201d may have \u201cgotten out.\u201d Likewise the words \u201csmoke, vapors, soot, fumes, acids, alkalis, toxic chemicals, liquids or gases, waste materials or other irritants, contaminants or pollutants\u201d also obviously overlap, but again each conveys a slightly different thought. Given that the phrase \u201csudden and accidental\u201d consists of only two words, there is all the more reason to conclude that \u201csudden\u201d was intended to convey some independent meaning not subsumed by \u201caccidental.\u201d Giving \u201csudden\u201d a meaning independent of \u201caccidental,\u201d therefore, requires giving it a meaning with a temporal aspect\u2014immediacy, quickness or abruptness\u2014that does not allow it to cover events, such as happened in this case\u2014that occurred gradually.  We therefore conclude, in the context of this case, that \u201csudden and accidental\u201d unambiguously does not include gradual pollution.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1320-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1788\">*1788</page-number>However, even if, for sake of argument, one concludes that \u201csudden and accidental\u201d is ambiguous, the judgment must still be affirmed. Following the framework of <em>Bank of the West </em>and <em>AIU, </em>ambiguity would require us to address whether coverage is consistent with the <em>objectively reasonable </em>expectations of the insured. It clearly is not.</p>\n<p id=\"b1320-4\">One of the less remarked aspects in the great war over the pollution exclusion is this: whatever \u201csudden\u201d means, it does not mean gradual. The ordinary person would never think that something which happened gradually also happened suddenly. The words are antonyms. As our colleagues in <em>Shell Oil </em>put it, \u201cWe cannot <em>reasonably </em>call \u2018sudden\u2019 a process that occurs slowly and incrementally over a relatively long time.\u201d (12 Cal.App.4th at p. 754, italics added.) The word \u201csudden\u201d has been recognized as conveying a meaning <em>opposite </em>to that of gradual in usage by both the California Supreme Court and the various state courts of appeal. (See <em>City of Long Beach </em>v. <em>Mansell </em>(1970) 3 Cal.3d 462, 469, fn. 4 [91 Cal.Rptr. 23, 476 P.2d 423] [contrasting \u201cgradual natural accretion\u201d with \u201csudden <em>avulsion\u201d]; Prudential-LMI Com.

Their argument may be summarized this way: prior to 1970, the CGL had no pollution exclusion and the policy\u2014at least as interpreted by the courts\u2014allowed for coverage for gradual pollution as long as the damages were not intended by the policyholder. Between 1970 and 1973 the pollution exclusion was phased in, but, as Montrose puts it, \u201cindustry spokesmen\u201d stated that the intent of the exclusion \u201cwas to clarify the existing scope of coverage, rather than to restrict it.\u201d Specifically, the phrase \u201csudden and accidental,\u201d having been construed in the context of boiler and machinery policies to mean unforeseen and unexpected, the \u201cindustry\u201d incorporated the pollution exclusion into the CGL to emphasize the idea that coverage should be restricted to \u201cunintended and unexpected\u201d pollution, even if it occurred gradually, and the \u201cinsurance industry\u201d represented as much to state insurance regulatory bodies.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1322-5\">Montrose Chemical Company argues that \u201cevery appellate court which has examined the drafting history has concluded that the policyholder interpretation should prevail.\u201d The argument is a well-veiled tautology, even assuming the assertion that \u201cevery\u201d court which has \u201cexamined\u201d the drafting history has decided the same way (at least up to now) is true. Given the rule that unambiguous language should control, use of drafting history indicates that the court involved has already decided that the language is ambiguous.</p>\n<p id=\"b1322-6\">In any event, the drafting history argument is unpersuasive. First and foremost, the drafting history argument is inconsistent with the rules of insurance contract interpretation articulated in <em>Bank of the West </em>and <em>AIU. </em>Both <em>Bank of the West </em>and <em>AIU </em>clearly require a showing of ambiguity before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1791\">*1791</page-number>extrinsic evidence may be admitted to shed light on that ambiguity. (See <em>Bank of the West, supra, 2 </em>Cal.4th at p. 1264 [\u201cIf contractual language is clear and explicit, it governs.\u201d]; <em>AIU, supra, </em>51 Cal.3d at p. 822 [intent of parties to be derived, \u201cif possible, <em>solely </em>from the written provisions of the contract\u201d (italics added)]; <em>Shell Oil, supra, </em>12 Cal.App.4th at p. 737 [\u201conly\u201d the basic principles are needed to interpret contract language]; see also <em>Aim Insurance Co. </em>v. <em>Culcasi, supra, </em>229 Cal.App.3d at pp. 218-219 [following <em>AIU </em>and starting analysis by asking whether the meaning a layperson would give to the policy language was unambiguous].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1323-5\">As shown above, the phrase \u201csudden and accidental\u201d unambiguously does not include \u201cgradual.\u201d Indeed, if there is a key word in California\u2019s statement of the parol evidence rule (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1856) it is \u201ccontradict.\"<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> Whatever else extrinsic evidence may be used for, it may not be used to show that words in contracts mean the exact opposite of their ordinary meaning. <em>(Cf. Brant v. California Dairies, Inc. </em>(1935) 4 Cal.2d 128, 133-134 [48 P.2d 13] [testimony of the vice president of a corporate defendant was not admissible to show an understanding contrary to the plain meaning of the series of letters forming the contract].) To allow extrinsic evidence to show that \u201csudden and accidental\u201d may mean \u201cgradual as long as unintended and unexpected\u201d is to allow extrinsic evidence to contradict the terms of the contract by stripping from \u201csudden\u201d its unambiguous meaning of \u201cnot gradual.\u201d The idea is not judicially sound.  \u201cUnlike the deconstructionists at the forefront of modern literary criticism, the courts still recognize the possibility of an unambiguous text.\u201d <em>(Ideal Mut. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Last Days Evangelical Ass\u2019n </em>(5th Cir. 1986) 783 F.2d 1234, 1238.)<footnotemark>45</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1323-6\">Second, reliance on extrinsic drafting history contradicts the basic rule that words in insurance policies should be interpreted as laypersons would interpret them. <em>(American Star Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Insurance Co. of the West </em>(1991) 232 Cal.App.3d 1320, 1330-1331 [284 Cal.Rptr. 45] [rejecting use of industry publication as interpretative aide because use would contravene <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1792\">*1792</page-number>layperson interpretation principle].) As another panel of this court stated in <em>American Star, </em>policyholders do not have ready access to insurance industry publications (232 Cal.App.3d at p. 1331). Nor, we might add in reference to the current litigation, do either insurers or policyholders have ready access to what members of a trade group committee supposedly told some state regulators in the early 1970\u2019s. The drafting history argument assumes that all insurers <em>and </em>all policyholders were aware of \u201cindustry interpretations\u201d of the 1973 pollution exclusion, a proposition for which there is obviously no support in either this record or in the briefs of amici curiae. (See <em>AIU, supra, </em>51 Cal.3d at p. 823 [no evidence insured understood policy language in any technical sense].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1324-4\">Third, and related to this last point, the drafting history argument assumes that individual insurers should be bound by statements made by \u201cindustry spokesmen\u201d years before. Yet there is no authority cited requiring they should be so bound. In the present case, for example, there was no evidence that <em>this </em>insurance company, Northbrook, ever represented to <em>this </em>policyholder, ACL, that despite what the ordinary person might think about the relationship between gradual and sudden, in this particular policy the word \u201csudden\u201d would have some <em>special </em>meaning in contradiction to that relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b1324-5\">Finally, there is no legal authority for the use of drafting history. Montrose Chemical Company cites two cases for the proposition that California courts treat contemporaneous statements by the drafters as highly probative of contractual intent: <em>ITT World Communications, Inc. </em>v. <em>City and County of San Francisco </em>(1985) 37 Cal.3d 859 [210 Cal.Rptr. 226, 693 P.2d 811] and <em>Fireguard Sprinkler Systems </em>v. <em>Scottsdale Ins. </em>(9th Cir. 1988) 864 F.2d 648, 651. However, <em>ITT World </em>was a constitutional interpretation case which merely noted in passing that the California Supreme Court may disregard the \u201cliteral language of enactments ... to avoid absurd results.\u201d (See 37 Cal.3d at p. 867.)<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> There is, of course, no argument here that to read \u201csudden\u201d as <em>not </em>gradual is absurd (the absurdity lies in the opposite direction).</p>\n<p id=\"b1324-6\">The other case, <em>Fireguard, </em>was a federal decision construing Oregon law. See 864 F.2d at page 651: \u201cUnder Oregon law we may examine extrinsic evidence as an aid to determining the meaning of contract language, even if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1793\">*1793</page-number>the contract, on its face, is not ambiguous.\u201d As shown by the statements from <em>Bank of the West </em>and <em>AIU </em>above, that is not the rule in California.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1325-5\">Montrose also contends that even if \u201csudden and accidental\u201d is not ambiguous \u201con its face,\u201d we should still \u201cconsider\u201d the drafting history \u201cas an initial matter\u201d to show the words really are ambiguous. For this it relies solely on <em>Pacific Gas &amp; E. Co. </em>v. <em>G. W. Thomas Drayage etc. Co. </em>(1968) 69 Cal.2d 33 [69 Cal.Rptr. 561, 442 P.2d 641, 40 A.L.R.3d 1373],</p>\n<p id=\"b1325-6\"><em>Pacific Gas </em>has been criticized for casting doubt on the very possibility of finding meaning in language.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> (See <em>Trident Center </em>v. <em>Connecticut General Life Ins. </em>(9th Cir. 1988) 847 F.2d 564, 569 [\u201cIf we are unwilling to say that parties, dealing face to face, can come up with language that binds them, how can we send anyone to jail for violating statutes consisting of mere words lacking \u2018absolute and constant referents\u2019?\u201d].) In citing <em>Pacific Gas </em>for the idea that extrinsic evidence is <em>always </em>available to show ambiguity, no matter how plain the actual words of a contract may be, Montrose would appear to be tacitly agreeing with the critics\u2019 reading of <em>Pacific Gas.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1325-7\">With all due respect to the critics of <em>Pacific Gas, </em>the case is not an endorsement of linguistic nihilism. Despite what might be called its \u201cdeconstructionist\u201d dictum,<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> the actual holding of the case is a fairly modest one: courts should allow parol evidence to explain <em>special </em>meanings which the individual parties to a contract may have given certain words.</p>\n<p id=\"b1325-8\">No such evidence, of course, was ever offered in the case before us. There is nothing to indicate, for example, that an agent of Northbrook told an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1794\">*1794</page-number>officer of ACL that, despite the ordinary meaning of \u201csudden\u201d as \u201cnot gradual,\u201d Northbrook would agree to give the word a special meaning in the particular policy it was about to issue so that it would mean \u201cgradual.\u201d <em>That </em>is the sort of thing contemplated by <em>Pacific Gas.</em><footnotemark><em>50</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1326-4\">C. <em>Other Contentions</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1326-5\">ACL asserts that the pollution exclusion should be confined to \u201cactive polluters.\u201d This is merely a restatement of the idea that \u201csudden\u201d should be redefined to mean \u201cunexpected even if gradual.\u201d Moreover, the \u201cactive-passive\u201d distinction has nothing to do with the plain meaning of the word \u201csudden,\u201d and the distinction appears to have played no role in the state high court decisions holding that gradual pollution is inconsistent with a sudden and accidental release. (E.g., <em>Hybud Equip., supra, </em>597 N.E.2d 1096 [leakage from landfills]; <em>Upjohn Co., supra, </em>476 N.W.2d 392 [leakage from underground storage tank which had three holes due to corrosion]; accord, <em>Powers Chemco, supra, </em>548 N.E.2d 1301, 1302 [\u201cWe also reject plaintiff\u2019s contention that since it was not the actual polluter, but merely inherited the problem from the prior landowner, the pollution exclusion clause cannot bar its present insurance claim.\u201d].)<footnotemark>51</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1326-6\">ACL also suggests (albeit somewhat obliquely) that the trial judge in this case improperly put the burden on the insured of showing that the release in this case was sudden and accidental. We do not, however, need to decide who exactly has the burden of proof on the sudden and accidental issue to affirm the judgment here.  Assuming, for sake of analysis, that the insurer has the burden of showing that a release is not sudden and accidental, that burden was met in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1327-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1795\">*1795</page-number>There was substantial evidence presented to the trier of fact that the release of contaminants was a result of holes in the tanks which developed over time as a result of rust. Corrosion is, by definition, a gradual process. On the other hand, there was no evidence of any specific trauma to the tanks during the Northbrook policy period. This absence distinguishes this case from <em>Brian Chuchua\u2019s Jeep, Inc. </em>v. <em>Farmers Ins. Group </em>(1992) 10 Cal.App.4th 1579 [13 Cal.Rptr.2d 444], a recent decision of another panel of this court which employed concurrent causation analysis to rule in favor of first party insurance coverage for cleanup expenses of an underground gasoline storage tank that had been damaged in an earthquake. Even so, the court noted that the \u201crisk of leaking pollutants\u201d was not covered. (10 Cal.App.4th at p. 1583.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1327-5\">ACL\u2019s very theory that the release occurred during the policy period is necessarily predicated on the idea of a series of gradual, continuous leaks which might have taken place during the period September 1984 to September 1985. Under such circumstances, where there is no evidence of any traumatic release during the policy period, and substantial evidence of release from gradual corrosion, it is reasonably obvious that an insurer has carried any burden it might have to show the applicability of the pollution exclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1327-6\">IV. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b1327-7\">The language of the pollution exclusion is clear and unambiguous. Whatever shades of meaning inhere in the word sudden, gradual is not one of them.

(See, e.g., <em>New Castle County, supra, </em>933 F.2d at p. 1196 [\u201cWe agree with this assertion to a certain extent.\u201d]; <em>Just </em>v. <em>Land Reclamation, </em>Ltd1, <em>supra, </em>456 N.W.2d at p. 578 [\u201cthe fact that substantial conflicting authority exists . . . merely serves to strengthen the conclusion that the terms are susceptible to more than one meaning, and thus ambiguous\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1319-8\">The argument is unpersuasive. Different jurisdictions apply different rules governing the issue of textual ambiguity, and so may reach different results which are not necessarily logically inconsistent. The mere fact that judges of diverse jurisdictions disagree does not establish ambiguity under the particular principles which govern the interpretation of insurance contracts in California (see <em>ante, </em>at pp. 1784-1785).</p>\n<p id=\"b1319-9\">Specifically, cases which have held, on linguistic grounds, that the words sudden and accidental are ambiguous have typically relied on the simple fact there are nontemporal dictionary definitions of the word sudden (see fn. 36, <em>ante) </em>to reach their result. (See, e.g., <em>New Castle County, supra, </em>933 F.2d 1162; <em>Hecla Min. Co. </em>v. <em>New Hampshire Ins. Co., supra, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1788\">*1788</page-number>811 P.2d 1083.) In essence, these courts considered it sufficient that ambiguity be established <em>in the abstract. </em>Whatever the intrinsic merits of this idea, it is contrary to the rule in California. <em>iBank of the West, supra, </em>2 Cal.4th at p. 1265, quoted <em>supra </em>at p. 1785.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1320-6\">Other cases have reached different results on nonlinguistic grounds. Some jurisdictions\u2014 but not California\u2014allow extrinsic evidence even where contract terms are unambiguous (see discussion, <em>infra, </em>at p. 1792 [Oregon allows, California does not]). And some jurisdictions have relied on an \u201cestoppel\u201d or regulatory history rationale not necessarily related to any textual ambiguity (see, e.g., <em>Joy Technologies </em>v. <em>Liberty Mut. Ins., supra, </em>421 S.E.2d 493; see also <em>Queen City Farms, supra, </em>827 P.2d 1024, 1049-1050 [partial reliance on drafting history]).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"40\">\n<p id=\"b1321-5\">The tendency of some courts to define \u201csudden\u201d in such a way as to encompass gradual pollution brings to mind W.

(E.g., <em>Outboard Marine, supra, </em>607 N.E.2d at pp. 1217-1220.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1321-9\">The closest <em>Outboard </em>comes to confronting the mutual exclusivity of the ideas of sudden and gradual is this (relatively obscure) passage:</p>\n<p id=\"b1321-10\">\u201cTo construe \u2018sudden\u2019 to mean \u2018abrupt\u2019 results in a contradiction if one accepts the insurers\u2019 own definition of the term \u2018accident.\u2019 (See <em>Hecla Mining Co., </em>811 P.2d at 1092.) Such a construction would result in the pollution exclusion exception clause retriggering coverage for toxic releases which are \u2018abrupt\u2019 <em>and </em>gradual or \u2018continuous or repeated\u2019 releases. Clearly, under such a construction this clause would be rendered absurd.\u201d <em>(Outboard Marine, supra, </em>607 N.E.2d at p. 1219.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1321-11\">The flaw in this passage is the unsupported assumption that \u201cthe insurers\u2019 own definition of the term \u2018accident\u2019 \u201d <em>is synonymous </em>with gradual events. This is incorrect. The \u201cdefinition\u201d to which the passage refers is the definition of \u201coccurrence\u201d as \u201can accident, including continuous or repeated exposure to conditions.\u201d The definition shows that a \u201crepeated exposure to conditions\u201d can fall within the meaning of occurrence. But there is obviously no requirement that repeated exposure <em>must </em>fall within the meaning of \u201caccident.\u201d The definition of \u201coccurrence\u201d cannot reasonably be read to mean that an accident must entail \u201crepeated exposure to conditions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1321-12\">Then again, this is only common sense. Most accidents do not involve a \u201crepeated exposure to conditions\u201d and most \u201crepeated exposure to conditions\u201d does not involve an accident. Accordingly, it is hardly \u201cabsurd\u201d to give \u201csudden\u201d its natural meaning of \u201cnot gradual.\u201d If an event is both accidental and sudden, there is no possibility that it will be both gradual and abrupt.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"42\">\n<p id=\"b1321-13\">A relatively well-known example of how \u201csudden\u201d can mean \u201cunexpected\u201d is from the popular comic strip, \u201cPeanuts.\u201d The character Snoopy is sometimes shown typing out a story beginning, \u201cIt was a dark and stormy night. Suddenly a pirate ship appeared on the horizon. . . .\u201d In these two sentences, \u201csuddenly\u201d can mean either unexpected (the pirate ship appeared without warning) or abrupt (one moment there was no ship, the next moment there was).
