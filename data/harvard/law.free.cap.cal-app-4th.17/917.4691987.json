Code, \u00a7 1538.5) was denied and he pleaded guilty to possession for sale and sale of phencyclidine (PCP). (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 11378.5,11379.5.) He claims the trial court erred in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"921\">*921</page-number>denying his motion to suppress evidence against him. He argues that the evidence was the product of an unlawful pretextual traffic stop. We disagree and affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">\n<em>Facts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b713-6\">At approximately 9:20 p.m. on February 8,1991, Officer Steve Becerra of the Gilroy Police Department was driving a marked police car on patrol near the Gilroy Apartments, when a car containing three people passed him going the other way. Becerra recognized Yvonne Lucero, the driver, and defendant, the front seat passenger, from previous arrests involving PCP. He recognized the other passenger Leticia Cuellar but did not know her name. Their car entered a parking lot, and Becerra decided to follow them. He made a U-turn and entered the lot. He passed Lucero\u2019s car and noticed that Cuellar had a blank stare.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-7\">Lucero parked her car, and Becerra moved on to an adjacent lot. From there, he watched Lucero and Cuellar get out of the car and walk away. Cuellar still had a blank look and walked slowly and deliberately and at times needed Lucero\u2019s help. Becerra thought Cuellar might be under the influence of something, perhaps PCP. Defendant also got out of the car but stayed near it.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-8\">After about two minutes, Lucero and Cuellar returned, and Cuellar reentered the backseat. Lucero went to the trunk, opened it, put her hands inside, and moved them around. One of her hands had been closed, and Becerra thought she had put something inside. During this time, defendant stood slightly behind her and kept looking around and out toward the driveway. After Lucero closed the trunk, she and defendant reentered the car and drove out of the parking lot.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-9\">Becerra followed Lucero out of the lot and down Murray Street. He had no idea how far or where he was going to follow them and had no plan at that time to stop them. However, about one block from the Gilroy Apartments, Lucero made a left turn without signalling, in violation of Vehicle Code section 22107.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Becerra activated his lights and made a stop.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-10\">Becerra asked Lucero for her driver\u2019s license. She told him it was suspended. Becerra brought her to his patrol car to get more information and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"922\">*922</page-number>begin writing a citation. He then returned to Lucero\u2019s car to check on Cuellar\u2019s condition and see whether there was a validly licensed driver who could drive Lucero\u2019s car.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-4\">Becerra again saw that Cuellar\u2019s movements were slow and deliberate. When asked her name, date of birth, and address, she was not able to complete a sentence. Becerra, who the parties later agreed had expertise concerning the symptoms of PCP use, concluded that Cuellar was under the influence of PCP. He also spoke to defendant, who appeared to be coherent.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">Becerra returned to Lucero, talked with her about her license, and asked for her address and car registration information. When he told her he thought Cuellar was under the influence of PCP, Lucero became very concerned. She said she did not believe or know anything about that and told Becerra that she was already on probation for a PCP-related offense and would not have anything to do with PCP. Becerra asked who her probation officer was, and Lucero told him. He asked if she had a probation search clause, and she said she did. He then asked if he could search her car, and she consented.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-6\">Becerra had defendant and Cuellar get out of the car so he could search inside without having to lean over them and expose the items on his gun belt. At that point, a backup officer arrived. Becerra then searched the car, and in the trunk he found a blue binder. Inside it, he found a baggie containing several hand-rolled cigarettes which were later found to contain PCP. Defendant, Lucero, and Cuellar were then arrested.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b714-7\">\n<em>Standard of Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b714-8\">In reviewing the denial of a motion to suppress evidence, we view the record in the light most favorable to the trial court\u2019s ruling and defer to its findings of historical fact, whether express or implied, if they are supported by substantial evidence. We then decide for ourselves what legal principles are relevant, independently apply them to the historical facts, and determine as a matter of law whether there has been an unreasonable search and/or seizure. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Williams </em>(1988) 45 Cal.3d 1268, 1301 [248 Cal.Rptr. 834, 756 P.2d 221].)</p>\n<p id=\"b714-9\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b714-10\">Defendant concedes that Lucero\u2019s failure to signal her left turn provided a \u201cnominal\u201d basis for a traffic stop. He contends, however, that Becerra used the stop as a pretext to investigate his suspicion of criminal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"923\">*923</page-number>activity unrelated to the traffic violation. He argues that such a stop is unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution and that here the illegal stop vitiated Lucero\u2019s consent to search the car. Thus, he claims that the warrantless search of the trunk was illegal and the evidence found therein should have been suppressed.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">According to one court, \u201ca pretextual arrest occurs when the police employ an arrest based on probable cause as a device to investigate or search for evidence of an unrelated offense for which probable cause is lacking. [Citations.] As such, the arrest serves as a means to circumvent the warrant requirement of the [F]ourth [AJmendment.\u201d <em>(U.S. </em>v. <em>Trigg </em>(7th Cir. 1989) 878 F.2d 1037, 1039.)</p>\n<p id=\"b715-6\"> Although federal courts long ago decried this practice (see, e.g., <em>Henderson </em>v. <em>United States </em>(4th Cir. 1926) 12 F.2d 528, 531 [51 A.L.R. 420]; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Lefkowitz </em>(1932) 285 U.S. 452, 467 [76 L.Ed. 877, 883-884, 52 S.Ct. 420, 82 A.L.R. 775]), recent pronouncements by the United States Supreme Court have made analyzing a claim of pretextual arrest more complicated.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b715-7\">On the one hand, the definition of a \u201cpretextual arrest\u201d noted above suggests that a police officer\u2019s subjective ulterior investigative motive can render an ostensibly valid search incident to an arrest unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment. (See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Smith </em>(9th Cir. 1986) 802 F.2d 1119, 1124 [claim of pretext is question of the \u201cmotivation or primary purpose\u201d of the arresting officer].) On the other hand, the Supreme Court in <em>Maryland </em>v. <em>Macon </em>(1985) 472 U.S. 463 [86 L.Ed.2d 370, 105 S.Ct. 2778] stated, \u201cWhether a Fourth Amendment violation has occurred \u2018turns on an objective assessment of the officer\u2019s actions in light of the facts and circumstances confronting him at the time,\u2019 and not on the officer\u2019s actual state of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"924\">*924</page-number>mind at the time the challenged action was taken.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 470-471 [86 L.Ed.2d at pp. 377-378]; see also <em>Horton </em>v. <em>California </em>(1990) 496 U.S. 128 [110 L.Ed.2d 112, 123-125, 110 S.Ct. 2301, 2308-2309]; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Villamonte-Marquez </em>(1983) 462 U.S. 579, 584, fn. 3 [77 L.Ed.2d 22, 27-28, 103 S.Ct. 2573]; <em>Scott </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1978) 436 U.S. 128, 138 [56 L.Ed.2d 168, 178, 98 S.Ct. 1717]; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Hill </em>(1974) 12 Cal.3d 731 [117 Cal.Rptr. 393, 528 P.2d 1] [overruled on other grounds in <em>People </em>v. <em>DeVaughn </em>(1977) 18 Cal.3d 889, 896, fn. 5 (135 Cal.Rptr. 786, 558 P.2d 872)].)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b716-4\">The effort to harmonize the concept of pretextual arrests with the Supreme Court\u2019s pronouncements has precipitated a conflict in case law and robust academic debate concerning how to analyze a claim of pretextual arrest, especially when based on a traffic stop. (See <em>Cummins </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1991) _ U.S. _ [116 L.Ed.2d 448, 449, 112 S.Ct. 428, 429 (dis. opn. of White, J. [certiorari should be granted to resolve conflict among circuits]; see, e.g., <em>U.S. </em>v. <em>Causey, supra, </em>834 F.2d 1179 (maj., dis., and cone, opns.); compare <em>U.S. </em>v. <em>Trigg, supra, </em>878 F.2d 1037; <em>U.S. </em>v. <em>Guzman </em>(10th Cir. 1988) 864 F.2d 1512; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Smith, supra, </em>802 F.2d 1119; see also discussion and cases and authorities cited in 1 LaFave, Search &amp; Seizure (2d ed. 1987) [LaFave] \u00a7 1.4(e), pp. 90-97, and Supp. (1993) p. 17, fn. 3 and pp. 19-21; 3 LaFave, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 7.5(e), pp. 141-145, and Supp. (1993) pp. 35-36.)</p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">Some courts have not considered the impact of the Supreme Court\u2019s statements and hold that the officer\u2019s <em>subjective </em>motivation or primary purpose in making the arrest is dispositive on the reasonableness of a subsequent search. (See, e.g., <em>United States </em>v. <em>Smith, supra, </em>802 F.2d at p. 1124 [following <em>Williams </em>v. <em>United States </em>(9th Cir. 1969) 418 F.2d 159, 161]; <em>U.S. </em>v. <em>Reeves </em>(E.D.Wash. 1992) 798 F.Supp. 1459, 1463; <em>U.S. </em>v. <em>Hill </em>(D.N.D. 1987) 666 F.Supp. 174, 176; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Keller </em>(N.D.Ill. 1980) 499 F.Supp. 415, 416; <em>United States </em>v. <em>D\u2019Alo </em>(D.R.I. 1979) 486 F.Supp. 945, 949; see also <em>U.S. </em>v. <em>Lillard </em>(9th Cir. 1991) 929 F.2d 500, 502; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Prim </em>(9th Cir. 1983) 698 F.2d 972, 975.)</p>\n<p id=\"b716-6\">Most federal courts, however, have rejected this view and conclude that the Supreme Court\u2019s statements require that the reasonableness of an arrest and search be solely determined by the <em>objective </em>circumstances. Two conflicting objective tests have emerged.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-7\">Under the majority test, the inquiry focuses on whether the officer was legally authorized to make an arrest and conduct a search. If, in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"925\">*925</page-number>abstract, the officer does no more than he or she is legally permitted to do, regardless of the subjective intent with which it was done, the arrest and search are objectively reasonable and constitutionally proper. <em>(U.S. </em>v. <em>Mitchell </em>(D.C. Cir. 1991) 951 F.2d 1291, 1295; <em>U.S. </em>v. <em>Cummins </em>(8th Cir. 1990) 920 F.2d 498, 500-501; <em>U.S. </em>v. <em>Trigg, supra, </em>878 F.2d at p. 1041; <em>U.S. </em>v. <em>Causey, supra, </em>834 F.2d at pp. 1084-1085; <em>U.S. </em>v. <em>Hawkins </em>(3d Cir. 1987) 811 F.2d 210, 212-215.)</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">Under the minority test, the arresting officer\u2019s conduct is measured against a \u201creasonable officer\u201d standard. The pertinent question is not whether the officer <em>could </em>validly have made an arrest and conducted a search but whether under the same circumstances a reasonable officer <em>would </em>have done so in the absence of the invalid purpose. <em>(United States </em>v. <em>Smith </em>(11th Cir. 1986) 799 F.2d 704, 709; <em>U.S. </em>v. <em>Guzman, supra, </em>864 F.2d at p. 1517; <em>U.S. </em>v. <em>Johnson </em>(5th Cir. 1987) 815 F.2d 309, 315.) Relevant objective circumstances might include, among other things, whether there has been an investigation of the defendant for other criminal activity prior to the arrest; whether the duties of the arresting officer would normally include making this particular kind of arrest (e.g., a Federal Bureau of Investigation officer making a traffic stop); whether the arresting officer is required to or normally would arrest the defendant for his or her conduct. (See <em>U.S. </em>v. <em>Guzman, supra, </em>864 F.2d at p. 1518; <em>Amador-Gonzalez </em>v. <em>U.S. </em>(5th Cir. 1968) 391 F.2d 308, 314.)</p>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">Recently, in <em>People </em>v. <em>Uribe </em>(1993) 12 Cal.App.4th 1432 [16 Cal.Rptr.2d 127], the defendant claimed that a traffic stop was merely a pretext to search for drugs.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> On appeal, the court noted the United States Supreme Court\u2019s statements discussed above <em>(ante, </em>pp. 923-924) and held that the subjective motivation of the arresting officer could not render an objectively reasonable traffic stop improper. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1436.) The court recited the majority and minority tests but did not clearly adopt one over the other. Rather, it implicitly concluded that the stop was proper under either test, stating it was objectively reasonable for a traffic officer to stop the defendant because of the way he was driving. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1438.)</p>\n<p id=\"b717-7\">We agree with <em>Uribe </em>and the overwhelming majority of courts that the subjective motivation of an arresting officer is irrelevant in determining the propriety of a traffic stop. Thus, we decline to follow those cases, cited above <em>(ante, </em>p. 924), in which the subjective motivation of the arresting officer was still considered dispositive.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"926\">*926</page-number>Unlike the <em>Uribe </em>court, however, we formally adopt the majority test for determining the propriety of an officer\u2019s conduct during a traffic stop. Only this test properly maintains analytical focus on the objective reasonableness of an officer\u2019s conduct and can produce results that are predictable and consistent and therefore useful to the law enforcement and the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-4\">Furthermore, we believe the rules that now govern official conduct during traffic stops preclude the police from using a stop for a traffic violation to conduct a general, warrantless search for evidence of any criminal conduct. Indeed, it was the very lack of such limits on the scope of a search incident to an arrest that gave rise to most of the case law on pretextual arrests. (See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Lefkowitz, supra, </em>285 U.S. 452; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Robinson </em>(D.C. Cir. 1972) 471 F.2d 1082, 1108 [153 App.D.C. 114] [revd. in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Robinson </em>(1973) 414 U.S. 218 (38 L.Ed.2d 427, 94 S.Ct. 467)]; <em>Amador-Gonzalez </em>v. <em>United States, supra, </em>391 F.2d 308.)</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">In particular, a police officer can legally stop a motorist <em>only </em>if the facts and circumstances known to the officer support at least a reasonable suspicion that the driver has violated the Vehicle Code or some other law. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1972) 7 Cal.3d 186, 200 [101 Cal.Rptr. 837, 496 P.2d 1205]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Griffith </em>(1971) 19 Cal.App.3d 948, 950-951 [97 Cal.Rptr. 367]; see <em>Terry </em>v. <em>Ohio </em>(1968) 392 U.S. 1, 16-19 [20 L.Ed.2d 889, 902-905, 88 S.Ct. 1868]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Franklin </em>(1985) 171 Cal.App.3d 627, 633 [217 Cal.Rptr. 529]; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>McGaughran (1979) </em>25 Cal.3d 577, 582 [159 Cal.Rptr. 191, 601 P.2d 207]; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Fouche </em>(9th Cir. 1985) 776 F.2d 1398, 1403 [80 A.L.R.Fed. 605] [traffic infraction always a basis for a stop].)</p>\n<p id=\"b718-6\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, 7 </em>Cal.3d 186, our Supreme Court explained the statutory scheme and procedures to be followed after a warrantless arrest for a Vehicle Code violation. Pertinent to our discussion here, the court observed that the scheme \u201cin effect presumes that in the vast majority of cases the violator will not be taken into custody[.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 199.)  With certain exceptions, an officer \u201cmust prepare a written notice to appear (i.e., a citation or \u2018ticket\u2019), and must release the violator \u2018forthwith\u2019 when the latter in turn gives his written promise that he will appear as directed [citations].\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b718-7\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>McGaughran, supra, 25 </em>Cal.3d 577, the court held that when an officer makes such a traffic stop, the stop may last only so long as is reasonably necessary to perform the duties incurred by virtue of the stop. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 584-587.)</p>\n<p id=\"b719-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"927\">*927</page-number>Thus, an officer may order the driver out of the car <em>(Pennsylvania </em>v. <em>Mimms </em>(1977) 434 U.S. 106, 108 [54 L.Ed.2d 331, 335, 98 S.Ct. 330]), ask for and examine the motorist\u2019s driver\u2019s license and the car registration, discuss the violation and listen to any explanation, write a citation, and obtain the driver\u2019s promise to appear. <em>(People </em>v. <em>McGaughran, supra, </em>25 Cal.3d at p. 584.)</p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">If the officer reasonably believes the vehicle is in a dangerously unsafe condition, then he or she may submit it to \u201cappropriate \u2018inspection\u2019 and \u2018tests[,]\u2019 \u201d and if the vehicle is exposed to danger, the officer may require the driver to proceed to a safer location before continuing the process. <em>(People </em>v. <em>McGaughran, supra, </em>25 Cal ,3d at p. 584.)</p>\n<p id=\"b719-6\">If the driver is unable to produce a driver\u2019s license, registration, or satisfactory proof of identity, then the officer may, depending on the circumstances, reasonably expand the scope of the stop, making it incrementally more intrusive. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Webster </em>(1991) 54 Cal.3d 411, 430-431 [285 Cal.Rptr. 31, 814 P.2d 1273]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Monroe </em>(1993) 12 Cal.App.4th 1174, 1182 [16 Cal.Rptr.2d 267]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Grant </em>(1990) 217 Cal.App.3d 1451, 1459 [266 Cal.Rptr. 587].)</p>\n<p id=\"b719-7\">However, since minor traffic offenses do not reasonably suggest the presence of weapons, an officer may not search the driver or those areas of a car where a weapon may be hidden and accessible unless the objective circumstances furnish reasonable grounds to believe the driver is armed and/or dangerous and may gain immediate control of a weapon. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>7 Cal.3d at p. 206; <em>Michigan </em>v. <em>Long </em>(1983) 463 U.S. 1032, 1049 [77 L.Ed.2d 1201, 1219-1220, 103 S.Ct. 3469]; <em>Terry </em>v. <em>Ohio, supra, </em>392 U.S. at p. 30 [20 L.Ed.2d at p. 911]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Williams </em>(1992) 3 Cal.App.4th 1100, 1104 [5 Cal.Rptr.2d 59]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Lafitte </em>(1989) 211 Cal.App.3d 1429, 1431-1432 [259 Cal.Rptr. 915].)</p>\n<p id=\"b719-8\">We acknowledge that a traffic stop can provide an officer with an opportunity to observe what is in plain view. However, it is settled that a plain view observation is not itself an invasion of privacy, that is, a search. (See <em>Horton </em>v. <em>California, supra, </em>496 U.S. at pp. 133-134 [110 L.Ed.2d at pp. 120-121, 110 S.Ct. at p. 2306].) And although the officer may not make an unlawful detention or arrest to gain plain view, a traffic stop for a vehicle code violation is not, standing alone, an unlawful arrest. In this regard, we agree with the analysis of Judge Wisdom in <em>Amador-Gonzalez </em>v. <em>United States, supra, </em>391 F.2d 308, that \u201c[flhere is a similarity between the effect of a \u2018pretextual arrest\u2019 and the effect of an unlawful arrest, but the two cannot be equated. Proof that a traffic arrest was only a pretext to search for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"928\">*928</page-number>evidence of another offense is significant legally only because it bears on the reasonableness of the search.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 315.)</p>\n<p id=\"b720-4\">In sum, the rules and procedures outlined above demand that every action taken by an officer in the course of making a traffic stop be objectively reasonable and justified by the specific facts and circumstances confronting the officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">These rules effectively prevent the use of routine traffic stops for vehicle code violations solely as a opportunity to search drivers, passengers, and/or vehicles without a warrant for purposes unrelated to traffic violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-6\">We conclude, therefore, that if, in the course of a traffic stop, the police do no more than they are legally authorized to do, a defendant\u2019s claim that the stop was nevertheless a pretext to conduct an otherwise unjustifiable search must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-7\">Those who urge adoption of the \u201creasonable officer\u201d test\u2014would a reasonable officer have made the arrest in the absence of an invalid purpose\u2014 submit that this test allows courts to determine whether an officer\u2019s decision to effect a traffic stop was arbitrary and therefore unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b720-8\">We, however, find this test to be problematic.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-9\">In essence, the \u201creasonable officer\u201d test asks courts to determine whether the arresting officer\u2019s conduct deviated from the usual practice of a \u201creasonable officer.\u201d To do this in a given case, the court must inquire into how police normally treat the particular Vehicle Code violation on which the stop was based. This \u201cusual practice\u201d is then elevated to a standard of procedure which the \u201creasonable officer\u201d would have followed. (See, e.g., <em>U.S. </em>v. <em>Valdez </em>(11th Cir. 1991) 931 F.2d 1448.) However, such a case-by-case, police-department-by-police-department approach fails to provide the consistency and predictability officers need to meaningfully understand their obligations under the Fourth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-10\">For example, in <em>U.S. </em>v. <em>Bates </em>(11th Cir. 1988) 840 F.2d 858, the court concluded that because the officer testified that he always stops cars for following too closely, the stop of the defendant\u2019s car was lawful despite the secondary suspicion of narcotics activity. On the other hand, in <em>State </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"929\">*929</page-number><em>Arroyo </em>(Utah.Ct.App. 1989) 770 P.2d 153 (revd. on other grounds in <em>State </em>v. <em>Arroyo </em>(Utah 1990) 796 P.2d 684), the court concluded that because the arresting officer was off duty, heading in the opposite direction, and rarely made stops for following too closely, a reasonable officer would not have stopped the defendant for this offense absent some unspecific suspicion. (See also, e.g., <em>United States </em>v. <em>Smith, supra, </em>799 F.2d at p. 711, fn. 10 [although traffic stop for weaving was a pretext, under <em>other </em>circumstances the same weaving might be grounds for a stop].)</p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">We do not believe the reasonableness of a traffic stop for an observed traffic violation should depend on the jurisdiction in which it occurs. Nor do we think that what the arresting officer does, or even the majority of officers in a department do, necessarily establishes a valid standard of what a reasonable officer would do under the same circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-6\">The usual-practices-of-the-police analysis, which is aimed at preventing the arbitrary exercise of the arrest power, has itself been criticized by one court for not really responding to the problem identified in pretext cases. <em>(U.S. </em>v. <em>Trigg, supra, </em>878 F.2d at p. 1041.) For example, \u201can arrest made for a improper reason will be valid so long as the decision to arrest for a particular offense is not a departure from the norm while an arrest made for proper reasons will be invalid if the decision to arrest for the particular offense is a departure from the norm.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>Consequently, this analysis has been rejected as an inappropriate, unwarranted, and far reaching check on the discretion of individual police officers to effect custodial arrests. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b721-7\">We next note that, in essence, the \u201creasonable officer\u201d test tries to divine what a reasonable officer\u2019s subjective motivation would be under similar circumstances. However, a significant factor in this determination is the arresting officer\u2019s invalid purpose, i.e., his or her subjective investigative motivation. Thus, although the \u201creasonable officer\u201d test purports to be objective, the analysis is not so different from a purely subjective approach to the question of whether police conduct was unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment. For this reason, the test has been rejected as inconsistent with the United States Supreme Court\u2019s direction to analyze police conduct without regard to the individual officer\u2019s subjective motivation. <em>(U.S. </em>v. <em>Cummins, supra, </em>920 F.2d at p. 501.)</p>\n<p id=\"b721-8\">Finally, we agree with the observation that this test places police \u201cunder the apprehension that their actions\u2014which often require the exercise of great discretion\u2014would be subject to misinterpretation months later in the antiseptic atmosphere of the courtroom.\u201d <em>(U.S. </em>v. <em>Trigg, supra, </em>878 F.2d at p. 1042 (conc. opn. by Ripple, J.).)</p>\n<p id=\"b722-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"930\">*930</page-number>Turning to the facts here, it is undisputed that Officer Becerra observed Lucero commit a moving traffic violation. Thereafter his conduct remained reasonably related to the duties incident to the stop, especially when Lucero informed him that her driver\u2019s license was suspended. Defendant does not claim otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-4\">In particular, it was reasonable for Becerra to speak with the passengers to determine if they could assume responsibility for driving Lucero\u2019s car. In the course of doing so, Becerra confirmed his suspicion that Cuellar was under the influence of PCP. He then returned to Lucero. In the course of obtaining pertinent information from Lucero, Becerra informed her about Cuellar\u2019s condition. Only then did Lucero volunteer information about a previous PCP-related offense, her probationary status, and search condition. This information, coupled with Lucero\u2019s denial of knowledge about Cuellar\u2019s condition and her conduct in the parking lot, reasonably justified Becerra\u2019s request for consent to search the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">In all, Becerra was legally authorized to make a stop for a traffic violation, his conduct thereafter remained reasonable and proper under the circumstances, and the search was effected pursuant to Lucero\u2019s consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-6\">Defendant notes that Officer Becerra did not testify that Lucero\u2019s unsignalled left turn was actually unsafe or that there was any other traffic around. That Lucero might not have been driving in an obviously dangerous manner is irrelevant. Under Vehicle Code section 22107, the failure to properly signal where another \u201cmay be affected by the movement\u201d is prima facie unsafe, for it creates the possible danger the statute was designed to prevent. Moreover, defendant is mistaken that there was no other traffic around. Officer Becerra was behind Lucero, and the primary benefit of the signal requirement is for the vehicles to the rear of the signalling vehicle. <em>(Stephens </em>v. <em>Hatfield </em>(1963) 214 Cal.App.2d 140, 144 [29 Cal.Rptr. 436].)</p>\n<p id=\"b722-7\">Citing <em>People </em>v. <em>Marquez </em>(1992) 1 Cal.4th 553 [3 Cal.Rptr.2d 710, 822 P.2d 418] and <em>People </em>v. <em>Haven </em>(1963) 59 Cal.2d 713 [31 Cal.Rptr. 47, 381 P.2d 927], defendant claims that our Supreme Court has recognized the illegality of pretextual traffic stops. Thus, he suggests that we, as a lower appellate court, are without power to adopt the majority test, which, he argues, effectively abolishes claims of pretextual traffic stops. (See <em>Auto Equity Sales, Inc. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1962) 57 Cal.2d 450 [20 Cal.Rptr. 321, 369 P.2d 937].) We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-8\">Although the court in <em>People </em>v. <em>Haven, supra, </em>59 Cal.2d 713, 719, quoted older federal cases for the proposition that \u201c \u2018an arrest may not be used as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"931\">*931</page-number>pretext to search for evidence\u2019[,]\u201d that case involved the <em>delay </em>of an arrest so that the search incident thereto would encompass a location different from where the defendant was located when probable cause to arrest allegedly arose.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">The federal cases cited in <em>Haven </em>involved either a general exploratory search incident to an arrest or an arrest made after consent to search had been refused. Moreover, <em>Haven </em>and the federal cases predate both the development of rules governing the scope of traffic stops and the United States Supreme Court\u2019s more recent statements concerning how to analyze Fourth Amendment violations. Consequently, we do not believe that under the doctrine of stare decisis, the court\u2019s general comments in <em>Haven </em>preclude us from adopting the majority test.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-6\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Marquez, supra, </em>1 Cal.4th 553, the California Supreme Court in dictum observed that it was not \u201cfaced with a situation in which the traffic stop is used as a pretext for investigation of other crimes for which there were not grounds to stop.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 578.) We do not consider this dictum a bar to our holding. We note, moreover, that the court cited <em>Cummins </em>v. <em>United States, supra, </em>_ U.S. _ [116 L.Ed.2d 448, 449, 112 S.Ct. 428, 429] and thus implicitly recognized the conflict among federal courts concerning the proper analysis of pretext claims and that the law in this area is unsettled.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-7\">Defendant also relies on <em>People </em>v. <em>Franklin, supra, </em>171 Cal.App.3d 627, where the court stated that a traffic stop \u201cmay not be used solely for the purpose of discovering evidence of another charge (i.e., to effect a so-called pretext search).\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 633.) There, however, the court found the rule inapplicable because after the stop but <em>before </em>the search, officers observed in plain view evidence of a recent robbery that <em>independently </em>established probable cause to search the car. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 631.)</p>\n<p id=\"b723-8\">The result in <em>Franklin </em>is sound and consistent with our analysis in this case. However, to the extent <em>Franklin </em>implies that an arresting officer\u2019s ulterior investigative purpose can render a stop for a violation of the Vehicle Code unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment, we respectfully disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-9\">Nevertheless, even under <em>Franklin, </em>defendant\u2019s claim of pretext here must fail. There, the evidence observed after the traffic stop independently justified an immediate warrantless search, even if the stop was initially made to investigate unrelated criminal conduct. Similarly, here the circumstances confronting Officer Becerra after the stop warranted his request for consent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"932\">*932</page-number>to search. Lucero\u2019s consent, in turn, independently justified the search of her car.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b724-4\">\n<em>Conclusion and Disposition</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">In light of our discussion, we conclude that the stop and search of Lucero\u2019s car were reasonable and proper. Thus, the trial court did not err in denying defendant\u2019s motion to suppress evidence found in the trunk.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-7\">Cottle, P. J., and Bamattre-Manoukian, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-8\">Appellant\u2019s petition for review by the Supreme Court was denied October 28, 1993. Lucas, C. J., and Mosk, J., were of the opinion that the petition should be granted.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b713-11\">Vehicle Code section 22107 provides, \u201cNo person shall turn a vehicle from a direct course or move right or left upon a roadway until such movement can be made with reasonable safety and then only after the giving of an appropriate signal in the manner provided in this chapter in the event any other vehicle may be affected by the movement.\u201d (See Veh. Code, \u00a7\u00a722108 [requiring signal for last 100 feet before turn]; 22110 [requiring signals by hand/arm or signal light] and 22111 [prescribing manner of giving hand/arm signals].)</p>\n<p id=\"b713-12\">A violation of this section is an infraction.

Code, \u00a7 40000.1.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b714-11\">Both defendant and Lucero were charged with possession for sale and sale of PCP.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b715-8\">In addition to the issue of pretextual police conduct, on which the parties here focus exclusively, the facts of this case suggest two additional issues. One is whether defendant, a passenger in Lucero\u2019s car, has \u201cstanding\" to challenge the search inside the trunk, that is, whether he personally had a reasonable expectation of privacy there. (See <em>Rakas </em>v. <em>Illinois </em>(1978) 439 U.S. 128, 148-149 [58 L.Ed.2d 387, 404-405, 99 S.Ct. 421].) The second is whether Officer Becerra was generally authorized to search Lucero and her property, including the trunk of her car, without probable cause, or even a reasonable suspicion of criminal conduct, pursuant to the search condition of her probation. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Viers </em>(1991) 1 Cal.App.4th 990, 993-994 [2 Cal.Rptr.2d 667].) The record before us was not sufficiently developed below to resolve the case on either of these grounds. Moreover, since the parties have neither briefed nor argued these issues, we too focus solely on the issue of pretextual traffic stops.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b715-9\">Questions regarding the suppression of evidence are controlled by federal constitutional law. <em>(In re Lance W. </em>(1985) 37 Cal.3d 873, 896 [210 Cal.Rptr. 631, 694 P.2d 744].)

He then asked for and obtained the defendant\u2019s consent to search the truck and found drugs. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Uribe, supra, </em>12 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1434-1435.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b720-11\">(See <em>U.S. </em>v. <em>Guzman, supra, </em>864 F.2d at p. 1516, and authorities cited therein; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Smith, supra, </em>799 F.2d at p. 711; <em>U.S. </em>v. <em>Causey, supra, </em>834 F.2d at p. 1189 (dis. opn. by Rubin, J.); 1 LaFave, Search &amp; Seizure, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 1.4(e), p. 95.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b724-9\">Defendant also cites <em>People </em>v. <em>Aguilar </em>(1991) 228 Cal.App.3d 1049 [279 Cal.Rptr. 246], However, that case involved the impoundment and inventory search of a car for which there was no objectively reasonable basis.
