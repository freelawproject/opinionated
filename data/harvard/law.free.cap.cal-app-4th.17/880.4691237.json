Concluding that appellants could not obtain a minimum bid under Code of Civil Procedure section 704.800,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the trial court denied the application. Our interpretation of the statute does not lead to the same conclusion, and we disapprove of its reasoning on that point. As explained below, the application should have been denied because it was not timely under section 704.750,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and we affirm the order on that alternate ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-7\">II., III.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b690-8\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-9\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"AP9\">\n<em>The Appeal</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AVQ\">A., B.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b690-10\">C. <em>The Term \u201cAll Liens and Encumbrances\u201d Under Section 704.800 Does Not Include the Lien of the Judgment Creditor Requesting the Sale</em></p>\n<p id=\"b690-11\">The trial court did not fix the amount of the homestead or the fair market value of the dwelling because it concluded that section 704.800<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> was determinative; and it found that the section prohibits the sale of a dwelling unless <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"883\">*883</page-number>a court can anticipate a bid that exceeds the amount of the homestead plus any additional liens and encumbrances, including the lien of the judgment creditor seeking the sale. Under the trial court\u2019s reasoning, if a bid were to match the highest appraisal of $325,000, and the maximum homestead exemption of $75,000 plus the $9,728.21 balance of the trust deed were deducted from the sale price, defendant\u2019s share of the remaining proceeds would fall far short of the $461,381.76 due to appellants. Since appellants\u2019 liens could not be satisfied, the court concluded that \u201call liens and encumbrances\u201d could not be satisfied and concluded further that it was prohibited from ordering the sale. While the trial court\u2019s reading of the statute appears to be supported by the statutory language, it is not supported by the statutory scheme or by the statutory history.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">In construing a statute, we begin with the fundamental rule that we must determine the intent of the Legislature to effectuate the purpose of the law. <em>(California Teachers Assn. </em>v. <em>San Diego Community College Dist. </em>(1981) 28 Cal.3d 692, 698 [170 Cal.Rptr. 817, 621 P.2d 856]; <em>Khan </em>v. <em>Medical Board </em>(1993) 12 Cal.App.4th 1834, 1842 [16 Cal.Rptr.2d 385].) Generally, courts look first to the language of the statute to determine meaning. <em>(Brown </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1984) 37 Cal.3d 477, 485 [208 Cal.Rptr. 724, 691 P.2d 272].) When statutory language is capable of two interpretations, we must look at the purpose of the law to ascertain the Legislature\u2019s intent. <em>(Ibid.) </em>Words must be construed in context and statutes must be harmonized with each other to the extent possible. <em>(California Mfrs. Assn. </em>v. <em>Public Utilities Com. </em>(1979) 24 Cal.3d 836, 844 [157 Cal.Rptr. 676, 598 P.2d 836].)  In addition, legislative history is a legitimate and valuable aid in determining statutory purpose.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> (24 Cal.3d at p. 844.) It is well established that reports of legislative committees and commissions are part of a statute\u2019s legislative history and may be considered when the meaning of a statute is uncertain. <em>(Hutnick </em>v. <em>United States Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Co. </em>(1988) 47 Cal.3d 456, 465, fn. 7 [253 Cal.Rptr. 236, 763 P.2d 1326].)</p>\n<p id=\"b691-7\">The phrase \u201call liens and encumbrances\u201d is capable of two interpretations. The Legislature could have intended the phrase to include the lien of the executing judgment creditor, or it could have meant only those liens which preceded the judgment lien being executed. The latter interpretation is supported by other parts of the statutory scheme. For example, as noted by the trial court, the distribution of the proceeds of the sale as found in section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"884\">*884</page-number>704.850 places the judgment creditor fourth on the list, separate from and later than \u201call liens and encumbrances.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In addition, once the dwelling is sold to enforce the judgment, \u201cthe lien under which it is sold [and] any liens subordinate thereto . . . on the property sold are extinguished.\u201d (\u00a7 701.630, made applicable to the homesteaded property by \u00a7 704.780; <em>Little </em>v. <em>Community Bank </em>(1991) 234 Cal.App.3d 355, 360 [286 Cal.Rptr. 4].) Section 701.630\u2019s application would be pointless if the phrase \u201call liens and encumbrances\u201d was not limited to those senior to the lien being executed. Thus, it appears that in light of these two sections, section 704.800 does not require the bid to include the amount due to the judgment creditor. For further support, we turn to the legislative history.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-4\">Section 704.800 was adopted in 1982 as part of a comprehensive statutory scheme governing the enforcement of judgments contained in Assembly Bill No. 707. (Stats. 1982, ch. 1364, \u00a7 2, p. 5168.)<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> When the bill was first introduced in March 1981, it did not contain the language at issue here, which was added by a Senate amendment in April 1982. According to a memorandum prepared by the California Law Revision Commission in May 1982, under the earlier version the sale of a dwelling required \u201conly the satisfaction of the total of (1) preferred labor claims and state tax liens that are superior to the judgment creditor\u2019s lien and (2) the amount of the homestead exemption.\u201d The memorandum noted that the phrase \u201call liens and encumbrances on the property\u201d was added to afford greater protection to the debtor in the event of an involuntary sale. The Commission explained the import of the language: \u201cThe purchaser at the execution sale must pay in cash as a minimum bid the total of (a) the amount of all liens and encumbrances (except that the judgment creditor need not pay the amount of his or her judgment in cash) and (b) the amount of the homestead exemption. It is unlikely that any sales will actually occur since the required minimum bill will ordinarily leave nothing in addition for the judgment creditor on the sale.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b692-5\">The commission quite clearly differentiated between the lien of the judgment creditor and other liens and encumbrances and determined that only the latter must be satisfied before the sale is approved.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"885\">*885</page-number>In addition, there is a memorandum by the Senate Committee on the Judiciary analyzing the June amendments to the bill. The memorandum cites the California Law Revision Commission as its source and states that the bill would provide that \u201ca homestead could not be sold for less than the amount of the homestead exemption plus any additional amount necessary to satisfy all liens and encumbrances on the property. According to the Commission, this provision is intended to enforce the principle that the debtor\u2019s property should not be sold at a sacrifice if <em>none </em>of the proceeds are to be applied to pay the debtor\u2019s debts.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">An August 1982 Senate amendment added the phrase \u201cincluding but not limited to any attachment or judgment lien\u201d to the reference to all liens and judgments. That additional language did not seem to change the section\u2019s meaning. In an analysis by the Assembly Office of Research of the Senate\u2019s amendments dated August 26,1982, we find: \u201cThe Senate Amendments . . . [s]pecify that other lien holders are to be paid before the judgment creditor upon the sale of a homestead. An additional court order would be required for any sale, and the debtor\u2019s property would be protected from sale at a sacrifice if <em>none </em>of the proceeds are to be applied to pay the debtor\u2019s debts.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">These analyses of the language at issue in this case do not support the trial court\u2019s reading of the statute. The Legislature was not attempting to ensure that all debts, including the judgment being executed by the sale, be satisfied by the sale of the dwelling. Rather, its purpose was to ensure that senior liens and encumbrances would be paid. It was repeatedly noted that the Legislature wanted to avoid the situation in which none of the sale proceeds went to pay debts. We place great meaning on the fact that the memoranda did not indicate that the Legislature wanted <em>all </em>debts to be satisfied by the proceeds of the sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-7\">The legislative materials also include a summary of the bill that was prepared by the Law Revision Commission and sent to then-Governor Brown in September 1982. It states: \u201cThe new law provides that, if a homestead declaration has been recorded, a judgment lien attaches to the surplus value of the homestead over the total of (1) all liens and encumbrances and (2) the amount of the homestead exemption.\u201d It is clear from the use of the phrase in that sentence that \u201call liens and encumbrances\u201d excludes the lien of the judgment creditor seeking the sale. Furthermore, if the Legislature meant that \u201call liens and encumbrances\u201d included the lien of the judgment creditor seeking the sale, it would have emphasized that the surplus value would have to equal the amount of that particular lien.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-8\">Based on the foregoing, we hold that \u201call liens and encumbrances\u201d in section 704.800 refers to those which are senior to the lien of the executing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"886\">*886</page-number>judgment creditor, and that the sale of the dwelling in this case is not prohibited by section 704.800. The bid on defendant\u2019s interest in the dwelling need not exceed the total amount of the judgments against defendant. The bid must exceed the amount of the homestead and the balance due on the deed of trust, and after defendant\u2019s wife receives her share, there must be some amount<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> remaining to partially satisfy plaintiffs\u2019 judgments.
