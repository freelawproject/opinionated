Citizens Casualty Co. of New York et al., 5 Cir. 1970, 431 F.2d 409, Part I.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b1120-8\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b1120-9\">The District Court denied the petition of plaintiff to proceed in forma pauperis and permitted plaintiff\u2019s complaint, brought under \u00a7 1983, to be filed for record purposes only. The District Court then denied leave to appeal in forma pauperis on the ground that the appeal was not taken in good faith. This court granted leave.</p>\n<p id=\"b1120-10\">The basis of the District Court\u2019s denial was that plaintiff could await his release from prison to pursue this litigation, his cause of action remaining viable during that time by reason of a Georgia statute, Tit. 3, \u00a7 801, Ga.Code Ann., which tolls the statutes of limitations for an imprisoned person.</p>\n<p id=\"b1120-11\">The right of a person to proceed in the courts of the United States without prepayment of fees and costs or security therefor rests upon his making affidavit \u201cthat he is unable to pay such costs or give security therefor.\u201d 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1915. If the affidavit establishes such inability, as this plaintiff\u2019s does, leave cannot be denied on the ground that at some future time the person\u2019s economic status might be improved and until that time in the future when things may be better the statutes of limitations are tolled. The statute permits no such standard, and employment of such a standard would present constitutional issues which we need not discuss.</p>\n<p id=\"b1120-13\">The District Court did not reach the question of whether the allegations of poverty were untrue or whether the action was frivolous or malicious. 28 U. S.C.A. \u00a7 1915(d). In the interest of judicial economy we note that the complaint states a valid cause of action under the notice pleadings standard enunciated in Campbell v. Beto, 460 F.2d 765 (CA5, 1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b1120-14\">The order of the District Court denying leave to commence his suit without prepayment of fees and costs or security therefor is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
