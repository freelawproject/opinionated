S.C. \u00a7 1623.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Appealing his conviction, Paolicelli\u2019s assignments of error include (1) that his responses to questions before the grand jury were literally accurate and were not false as a matter of law and, (2) that the Government failed to establish that the declarations made by him were material to the grand jury\u2019s inquisition.</p>\n<p id=\"b1068-17\">The charges against Paolicelli stemmed from his appearance before a grand jury which was investigating the activities of his employers, the Pomponio brothers, and particularly their alleged bribery of one Paul S. Fry to influence him relative to certain business transactions. One of the items was a Continental Mark III automobile allegedly given to Fry by the Pomponios in December of 1968. The record indicates that while the automobile was in fact purchased by the Pomponios, the purchase order and specifications were placed with the dealer by Paolicelli. Before the grand jury Paolicelli was asked whether he had purchased a vehicle from the dealer to which he responded in the negative. The record shows that his answers were something less than responsive and during the questioning counsel for the Government made it clear that in using the term \u201cpurchase\u201d or \u201cbuying\u201d he was attempting to elicit from Paolicelli whether he had placed an order or otherwise indicated to the dealer the specifications relative to the Continental Mark III. The examination closed with this exchange:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1068-18\">\u201cQ. My question to you is: did you \u2014 and I\u2019m not saying that you did and that I have any definite evidence that you did or didn\u2019t, I just want to get it fairly definite on the record <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"973\">*973</page-number>that you did not tell a Mr. Lyon at O\u2019Brien and Rohall the specifications that you wanted with regard to a Continental Mark III.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1069-5\">A. No, sir, I don\u2019t remember.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1069-6\">Q. If you had, you would remember?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1069-7\">A. I\u2019m pretty sure, if it comes to that type of car.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1069-8\">Q. Have you ever ordered a Continental Mark III in your life ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1069-9\">A. No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1069-10\">Q. Or got involved in the purchase of one in any way?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1069-11\">A. No, sir.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1069-12\">The foregoing questions and answers excerpted from Paolicelli\u2019s grand jury testimony were included in the indictment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1069-13\">Relying upon Bronston v. United States, 409 U.S. 352, 93 S.Ct. 595, 34 L.Ed.2d 568 (1973), Paolicelli takes the position that since the automobile was purchased by the Pomponios and not by him his answers were literally accurate and cannot support his conviction. We, of course, recognize the validity of the premise that if a party does not understand the question and gives a non-responsive answer, such an answer is not perjurious, nor can a charge of perjury \u201cbe sustained by the device of lifting a statement of the accused out of its immediate context and thus giving it a meaning wholly different than that which its context clearly shows.\u201d Fotie v. United States, 137 F.2d 831, 842 (8 Cir. 1943). However, we agree with the Government that the questions and answers in the present case, running from the general to the particular was precisely the kind of questioning which the Supreme Court indicated in <em>Bronston </em>would be sufficient to support a charge of perjury. The answer to Paoli-celli\u2019s additional contention that he was confused by the questioning is that the district judge as the finder of the facts resolved this issue against him and we accept that finding. The record demonstrates that the minds of the Government counsel and Paolicelli did, in fact, meet on the definition of the words being used in the interrogation, and in the context thereof Paolicelli\u2019s denial that he had ever been involved in any way in the purchase of the Continental Mark III was a false declaration knowingly made by him.</p>\n<p id=\"b1069-17\"> The second issue raised on this appeal by Paolicelli with respect to the materiality of his statements is, of course, one of law, Brooks v. United States, 253 F.2d 362 (5 Cir. 1958), cert. denied, 357 U.S. 927, 78 S.Ct. 1374, 2 L.Ed.2d 1372; United States v. Alu, 246 F.2d 29 (2 Cir. 1957), and the record amply supports the conclusion of the district court. The latitude of materiality with respect to grand jury proceedings was stated in United States v. Stone, 429 F.2d 138, 140 (2 Cir. 1970).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1069-18\">\u201cHowever, materiality of statements made in a grand jury investigation may more readily appear than that of similar evidence offered on an issue in civil or criminal litigation, since the purpose of the investigation is to get at facts which will enable the grand jury to determine whether formal charges should be made against someone rather than prove matters directly at issue. * * * Leads to further inquiry may be of material worth to an investigation. Thus the test of materiality is whether the false testimony has the natural effect or tendency to impede, influence or dissuade the grand jury from pursuing its investigation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1070-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"974\">*974</page-number>The relationship between the interrogation of Paolicelli and the grand jury\u2019s objective in investigating the possible bribery of Fry by the Pomponios is obvious and his false statements in respect thereto assuredly tended to impede the grand jury\u2019s investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1070-4\">We have carefully considered the other assignments of error and find them to be without merit. Accordingly, the conviction is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1070-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1068-13\">. 18 U.'S.C. \u00a7 1623 reads in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1068-14\">\u201c(a) Whoever under oath in any proceeding before or ancillary to any court or grand jury of the United States knowingly makes any false material declaration or makes or uses any other information, including any book, paper, document, record, recording, or other material, knowing the same to contain any false material declaration, shall be fined not more than $10,000 or imprisoned not more than five years, or both.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1069-14\">. In his brief and oral argument counsel for the defendant attached considerable significance to a typographical omission in the first question quoted in the indictment. However, it is clear from the record that the defendant and his trial counsel relied upon the transcript of the grand jury testimony and were neither misled nor prejudiced by such omission. Additionally, the failure to raise this issue at or prior to trial in the district court constituted a waiver of this technical defect. <em>See </em>Pifer v. United States, 158 F.2d 867 (4 Cir. 1946) ; Rule 12(b)(2), Fed.R.Cr.P.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b1070-6\">CRAVEN, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"ahv-dedup-0\">(dissenting):</p>\n<p id=\"b1070-7\">This perjury conviction rests on murky answers to imprecise questions about defendant\u2019s minor role in the purchase of a Lincoln Continental five years previously. Everyone agrees the defendant did not \u201cbuy\u201d the car in any sense of the word. All that he did was initiate the purchase made by his bosses, transmit special equipment specifications and confirm the order by telephone. The final retail purchase order ran to Paul Fry. The car was titled in Fry\u2019s name, and one of the Pomponios, defendant\u2019s employers, paid by check delivered directly to the salesman. The subsequent delivery to Fry occurred without the defendant\u2019s participation. There is no evidence the defendant knew the purchase was to bribe Fry or that he even knew Fry was to receive the car. Yet the majority concludes that the prosecutor \u201cmade it clear that in using the term \u2018purchase\u2019 or \u2018buying\u2019 he was attempting to elicit from Paolicelli whether he had placed an order or otherwise indicated to the dealer the specifications relative to the Continental Mark III.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1070-22\">I think the record points strongly in the opposite direction.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In light of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"975\">*975</page-number><em>Bronston\u2019s </em>observation that \u201c[p]recise questioning is imperative as a predicate for the offense of perjury,\u201d 409 U.S. at 362, 93 S.Ct. at 602, I do not think a prosecutor can be excused from the repeated application of the words \u201cbuy\u201d and \u201cpurchase,\u201d themselves words of art, to a set of facts that everyone agrees did not amount to buying or purchasing. He especially cannot be excused when, as here, the prosecutor himself had knowledge of the facts and the defendant was a bricklayer with a grade-school education,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> who had, as a matter of fact, actually bought a car for himself from the same dealer.</p>\n<p id=\"b1071-26\">The defendant expressed his obvious confusion with the questioner\u2019s attempts to pinpoint a transaction involving a Continental Mark III in which the defendant was neither the purchaser nor the ultimate recipient:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ABm\">Q. <em>[Y]ou </em>did not <em>purchase </em>an automobile at O\u2019Brien and Rohall?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1071-28\">A. . . . You\u2019re confusing me now.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1071-29\">A. ... I don\u2019t remember buying it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1072-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"976\">*976</page-number>Q. I\u2019m talking about a Continental Mark III.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1072-4\">A. No, sir, not that I recall.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1072-5\">Q. <em>You </em>didn\u2019t buy a Continental Mark III, or place the order or have anything to do with the purchase of a Continental Mark III at O\u2019Brien and Rohall ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1072-6\">A. No, sir, I don\u2019t remember <em>buying </em>the car.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1072-7\">Q. When I say \u201cbuying\u201d, I\u2019m talking about place the order and nothing else.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1072-8\">A. That <em>I, myself, </em>went and placed an order that says <em>I want a certain carl</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1072-9\">Q. <em>Right.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1072-10\">(Emphasis added.) To the defendant\u2019s last answer above, which showed him still responding in the context of a car for himself, the prosecutor responded with a confirmatory \u201cRight,\u201d followed immediately by:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1072-11\">Q. If <em>you </em>had, <em>you </em>would have remembered <em>buying </em>a Continental Mark III?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1072-12\">A. [Yes, if] <em>I had laid out any money </em>for a car like that, I think\u2014 I <em>bought </em>a Cougar from them, that\u2019s what I <em>bought.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1072-13\">Q. You <em>bought </em>a Cougar from them?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1072-14\">A. That\u2019s right.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1072-15\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1072-16\">Finally, the prosecutor got somewhat on target and began to ask questions that related to defendant\u2019s limited participation in the transaction. It is defendant\u2019s answers to these questions that are held false. Where the majority errs, I respectfully suggest, is in failing to read the answers in the context of the preceding questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1072-17\">Q. My question to you is: did you . . . tell a Mr. Lyon at O\u2019Brien and Rohall the specifications that you wanted with regard to a Continental Mark III?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1072-19\">A. No, sir, I don\u2019t remember.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1072-20\">Q. If you had, you would remember?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1072-21\">A. I\u2019m pretty sure, if it comes to that type of car.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1072-22\">Q. Have you ever ordered a Continental Mark III in your life?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1072-23\">A. No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1072-24\">Q. Or got involved in the purchase of one in any way ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1072-25\">A. No, Sir.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1072-26\">The first three questions, though perhaps merely ambiguous seen alone, were consistent with the preceding questions relating to the purchase of another car by the defendant \u2014 one for his own use. The answers were contextually truthful, and the majority does not indicate otherwise. The perjury conviction must therefore rest on the premise that the last question brought about the necessary meeting of the minds: that it clearly signaled to the defendant that the direction of the previous dozen questions was being reversed; that the defendant now suddenly understood that \u201cpurchase\u201d didn\u2019t mean purchase but meant telephoning an order in for his boss; and that with instant insight the defendant then knew the inquiry was whether he placed an order for his employers for a Continental Mark III to be purchased and delivered later by them to an unknown third party. Maybe so, but I respectfully suggest that one last question in a long series isn\u2019t enough for clarity, and that the prosecutor failed to carry his burden of pinning \u201cthe witness down to the specific object of the questioner\u2019s inquiry.\u201d Bronston v. United States, 409 U.S. at 360, 93 S.Ct. at 601.</p>\n<p id=\"b1072-27\">I would reverse.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1070-8\">. The prosecutor asked the following series of questions of defendant before the grand jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"aot-dedup-0\">Q.

No, sir, not that I know \u2014 I\u2019ve dealt with a lot of the cars though.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1070-10\">Q. What cars ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1070-11\">A.

Did you ever order a car for Mr. Lou Pomponio, Sr.?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1070-14\">A. No, I don\u2019t remember it. I don\u2019t remember ordering the car, no. I remember ordering a ear that I was using myself, yes, which was an LTD.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1070-15\">Q. You ordered a car that you were using yourself?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1070-16\">A. Yes, that\u2019s right, a company car.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1070-17\">Q. Is it your testimony that you have never ordered a car for Mr. Louis Pomponio, Sr., or for any of the Pomponio corporations?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aerc\">A. Let\u2019s put it this way: they allow me to go ahead and buy a car and I buy it. If that\u2019s purchasing, yes, I have done it that way.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1070-18\">Q. Who was the car for?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1070-19\">A. For me. I used it on the job.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1070-20\">Q.

Not that I can remember, no. I don\u2019t remember doing anything like that. I remember going \u2014 when my brother-in-law, Mr. Pomponio, bought his car, I went with him \u2014 and this was quite a while ago we\u2019re talking about. I went to see the car, the color and \u2014 I brought him up there, he took a car back \u2014 I don\u2019t remember how the thing goes, but to actually buy the car, no, I don\u2019t remember.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1070-24\">Q. When I say \u201cbuy\u201d, I don\u2019t mean pay for the car. I don\u2019t want to split hairs with you.
