Article 32 of the Convention provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1267-15\">\n<em>Expulsion</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1267-16\">1. The Contracting States shall not expel a refugee lawfully in their territory save on grounds of national security or public order.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1267-17\">Appellants are citizens of the People\u2019s Republic of China who had left Mainland China for Hong Kong several years before coming to the United States. Both are seamen, having Hong Kong seaman\u2019s documents, and were permitted to enter this country only as nonimmi-grant crewmen. As such they were authorized to remain in the United States only for a period not to exceed 29 days under \u00a7 252 of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1282. Both appellants deserted their ships in the United States and overstayed the 29-day period. Both were apprehended by officers of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, given deportation hearings and were found to be deportable to Hong Kong. Neither appealed the finding. Both remain in the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b1267-18\">The United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, Robert L. Carter, Judge, held that appellants were not \u201clawfully\u201d in the United States under the clear meaning of Arti-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1172\">*1172</page-number>ele 32 of the Convention, supported by the history of the treaty, its legislative history in the Senate, court rulings and the plain language of the words in question. Thus Article 32 affords no protection to the appellants, even if they are refugees. We agree with Judge Carter, whose careful opinion below, Chim Ming v. Marks, 367 F.Supp. 673 (S.D.N.Y. 1973), we rely upon and adopt. His opinion in turn finds support in and relies upon Kan Kam Lin v. Rinaldi, 361 F.Supp. 177 (D.N.J.1973), aff\u2019d, 493 F.2d 1229 (3d Cir. 1974) (per curiam), petition for cert. filed, 42 U.S.L.W. 3693 (U.S. May 15, 1974) (No. 73-1710).</p>\n<p id=\"b1268-4\">Denying the applicability of Article 32 in these cases is also supported by Article 31 <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> of the Convention, relating to refugees unlawfully in the country of refuge, which characterizes such refugees as those persons who \u201center or are present in their territory without authorization.\u201d Under Article 31 it is possible that the status of a refugee who has entered illegally the territory of a contracting state may subsequently be regularized. Conversely, the stay of a refugee who has entered in a regular manner may subsequently become unlawful as here, where appellants were admitted for a limited period only. Thus, the only rational interpretation that can be placed upon the term \u201clawfully in their territory\u201d in Article 32 is one consistent with the definition of unlawfulness in Article 31 as involving the status of being in a nation \u201cwithout authorization.\u201d Since a nation\u2019s immigration laws provide authorization, one unlawfully in the country is in violation of those laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b1268-9\">We need only add that Judge Carter\u2019s interpretation of Article 32 by no means makes the treaty a nullity and without benefit to refugees. There is protection under Subsection 2 of Article 31 insofar as it provides that \u201cContracting States shall allow such refugees a reasonable period and all the necessary facilities to obtain admission into another country.\u201d Under Paragraph 1 of Article 33 of the Convention, moreover, there need be no concern that the United States would return a refugee unlawfully here to a country where the refugee would be persecuted.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> This savings clause, so to speak, is further supported by the express terms of \u00a7 243(h) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1253(h).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Section 243(h) provides</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1268-10\">The Attorney General is authorized to withhold deportation of any alien within the United States to any country in which in his opinion the alien would be subject to persecution on account of race, religion, or political opinion and for such period of time as he deems to be necessary for such reason.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1268-11\">That an alien may be barred from seeking protection under Article 32 by virtue of his being unlawfully in this country does not prevent him from obtaining re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1173\">*1173</page-number>lief under available provisions of our immigration laws, including not only \u00a7 243(h), but also \u00a7 203(a)(7) of the Act, 8 \u00dc.S.C. \u00a7 1153(a)(7), referring to conditional entries.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1269-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1267-12\">. 19 U.S.T. 6259, T.I.A.S.
