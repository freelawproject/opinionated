The defendant appeals, raising four issues. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-10\">Two of defendant\u2019s four points on appeal relate solely to his 1967 conviction. The Government urges us to bypass consideration of these issues as Burrell received concurrent sentences on all three convictions. We feel we must decline the invitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-11\"> The concurrent sentence doctrine is one of \u201cjudicial convenience,\u201d Benton v. Maryland, 395 U.S. 784, 791, 89 S.Ct. 2056, 23 L.Ed.2d 707 (1969); United States v. Varner, 437 F.2d 1195 (5th Cir. 1971); United States v. Bigham, 421 F.2d 1344 (5th Cir. 1970), and does not pose a jurisdictional bar to consideration of any of the issues the defendant raises, Benton v. Maryland, <em>supra. </em>It is a matter of discretion whether to withhold full appellate review of a conviction the outcome of which could not affect the defendant\u2019s penal interest. Hirabayashi v. United States, 320 U.S. 81, 63 S.Ct. 1375, 87 L.Ed. 1774 (1943); United States v. Johnson, 496 F.2d 1131 (5th Cir. 1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-17\">Here we believe it is important to review all three of the counts for which the defendant was convicted, despite the fact that we affirm each of them. The crimes of tax evasion and filing a false income tax return involve delicate questions of intent; while the defendant\u2019s \u00a7 7201 conviction of tax evasion involves a jury finding of specific intent to avoid taxes, his two \u00a7 7206(1) convictions of knowingly filing false income tax returns also require a finding of scienter. Particularly in \u00a7 7201 cases, we have frequently held the trier of fact may properly rely on a pattern of understatement of income in previous years to infer the requisite specific intent of tax evasion. <em>See, e. g., </em>Holland v. United States, 348 U.S. 121, 139, 75 S.Ct. 127, 99 L.Ed. 150 (1954); United States v. Tunnell, 481 F.2d 149 (5th Cir. 1973); Holbrook v. United States, 216 F.2d 238 (5th Cir. 1954), cert. denied, 349 U.S. 915, 75 S.Ct. 605, 99 L.Ed. 1249 (1955). Thus in this case, Burrell\u2019s 1968 tax evasion conviction may very directly have been affected by the jury\u2019s finding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"907\">*907</page-number>of understatement of income in 1967, a finding the defendant challenges as being based on improper evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-6\">Burrell\u2019s 1967 return was found by the jury to be false in that it failed to report as income a $34,400.05 cheek which Burrell received from his employer, Hirseh and Co., in December, 1967. The fact that Burrell received this check is undisputed. Rather the defendant claims the check wasn\u2019t taxable income because it was in effect a loan.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-7\">Burrell was the office manager for the Miami office of Hirseh and Co., a stock brokerage firm. He had margin accounts established with his employer which he used for his own stock transactions. It was his practice to occasionally request that checks be drawn against his margin accounts to prepay a commission he was expecting within the next few days on a sale he had effected. These cheeks were drawn out of sequence on the firm\u2019s check blotter, to attempt roughly to predict at what point the normal commission would be paid. Thus here, Hirseh and Co. check No. 54944 was drawn on December 1, 1967 but the checks immediately preceding it on the blotter weren\u2019t drawn until January, 1968, and it wasn\u2019t until that time that the check in question was discovered by Hirseh and Co. to have been written.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-8\">How check No. 54944 came to be written is still uncertain. Burrell testified he had no recollection of it. Both Bur-rell\u2019s assistant manager and his head cashier testified they did not remember writing such a check \u2014 this despite the defendant\u2019s statement that he assumed the cashier must have drawn it. Burrell was shown to be one of only four individuals with access to the <em>check </em>blotter who could have written the check. In any event, once the check was discovered in January, several weeks after Burrell had been discharged by Hirseh and Co., the complany demanded repayment. After seven months of negotiations Bur-rell repaid the $34,400.05 in July, after the company made the formal statement that it was prepared to accept Burrell\u2019s assertion that it must have been drawn inadvertently.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-10\"> The question presented to the jury was whether this $34,400.05 was money Burrell embezzled from his employer, or whether it was simply an inadvertent advance on the defendant\u2019s margin account which was meant to be repaid. The jury found it to be taxable income, and thus inferentially must have found it to be embezzled. Money misappropriated from one\u2019s employer is taxaable, James v. United States, 366 U.S. 213, 81 S.Ct. 1052, 6 L.Ed.2d 246 (1961); Nordstrom v. United States, 360 F.2d 734 (8th Cir. 1966). We believe the jury\u2019s finding was a permissible one in light of all the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-11\">The evidence must be taken in the light most favorable to the Government, Glasser v. United States, 315 U.S. 60, 62 S.Ct. 457, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1942); United States v. Warner, 441 F.2d 821 (5th Cir. 1971), cert. denied, 404 U.S. 829, 92 S.Ct. 65, 30 L.Ed.2d 58 (1971) and after reviewing the record we do not conclude that a \u201creasonably minded jury\u201d aware of all the facts in the record, <em>\u201cmust </em>have a reasonable doubt\u201d of the defendant\u2019s intention to misappropriate the funds, United States v. Stephenson, 474 F.2d 1353, 1355 (5th Cir. 1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-12\">The Government proved the normal procedure employed by Burrell in the past when he wished an advance payment on expected commissions was to have his cashier draw the check out of sequence by <em>a few days </em>and credit that amount against his margin account. Burrell claimed that was all that happened in this case \u2014 but the Government proved Burrell\u2019s cashier had no knowledge of the check, that it was drawn not a few days out of sequence but <em>more than a month, </em>and that further it was immediately cashed by Burrell and used to cover a previous check for $34,400.00 which he had received in November. The December check was shown to be used to cover the bulk of this earlier ad-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"908\">*908</page-number>vanee, inasmuch as Burrell\u2019s checking account was substantially overdrawn. The balance over the amount his margin account was in arrears was used to cover a part of the overdrawn checking account. Thus, despite Burrell\u2019s claim that he had been completely unaware that the December 1 check had even been issued to him, the Government proved it was used immediately to cover past debts which Burrell apparently would have been unable to pay. Despite Burrell\u2019s further claim that he was so active in trading on his own account that he was oblivious to checks being drawn (for as he testified he was very active in the market, buying and selling $687,277 worth of securities in November, 1967 and $428,958 in December, 1967), he was shown to have been suffering huge losses in the market \u2014 and had a capital loss carryforward of over $170,000 in 1968. We believe the jury could properly find, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the $34,400.05 check was not merely an inadvertent advance on a loan account, but represented Burrell\u2019s intentional misappropriation of his employer\u2019s funds for his own use and thus was taxable income to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-4\">The defendant challenges the method by which the Government proved its case of embezzlement. First the defendant argues Government\u2019s Exhibit 35 was improperly admitted into evidence; second the defendant argues a statement made by one of the Government\u2019s witnesses was prejudicial and reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-5\">Exhibit 35 was an investigatory report compiled by an accounting firm engaged by Hirsch and Co. to audit Burrell\u2019s accounts following his discharge. The report by its own terms is a summary of findings, encompassing both conclusory impressions of the accountant who performed the audit as well as selected portions of Hirsch and Co. records. This report was admitted into evidence as a business record, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1732.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1004-9\">The Government contends United States v. DeFrisco, 441 F.2d 137 (5th Cir. 1971) is authority for the admissibility of such a report. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-10\">In <em>DeFrisco </em>a credit report was held to be admissible in a prosecution against DeFrisco\u2019s employer for giving false credit information and thereby assisting DeFrisco in misrepresenting his income to the Federal Housing Administration. As part of the FHA\u2019s investigation of DeFrisco it engaged a commercial credit reporting agency which inquired what DeFrisco\u2019s annual salary was from his employer. This investigation was done in the credit reporting agency\u2019s normal course of business, and the results of its inquiry were recorded within the time required by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1732. In <em>De-Frisco </em>the credit reporting agency\u2019s inquiry was itself a transaction of crucial importance to the case, and thus its report was \u201ca memorandum or record\u201d of an \u201cact, transaction, occurrence or event\u201d which was at issue in the case. As we said in <em>DeFrisco:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1004-11\">\u201cThe purpose of the federal Business Records Act is to dispense with the necessity of proving each and every book entry by the person actually making it. The theory underlying the Act is that business records in the form regularly kept by the particular company and relied on by that company in the ordinary course of its business have a certain probability of trustworthiness. . . . Therefore, \u2018so long as regard is paid to the indispensable fundamental trustworthiness <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"909\">*909</page-number>of the proffered record, the statute\u2019 . should of course be liberally interpreted so as to do away with the anachronistic rules which gave rise to its need and at which it was aimed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AJPt\">441 F.2d at 139-140. These standards were not met in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-4\">Exhibit 35 was a summary of Hirsch and Co.\u2019s records of Burrell\u2019s margin accounts. It was not a record of any act, for the fact that an audit was performed was not of significance to the case, for were it to be argued it constituted a \u201crecord\u201d of Burrell\u2019s dealings in his margin account it would obviously have been recorded long after the conduct at issue occurred, and thus fall outside \u00a7 1732 for that reason. Further the auditor\u2019s impressions and conclusions are not in our view vested with the type of indicia of reliability which complies with the policies of the Federal Business Records Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-5\">Despite its inadmissibility, however, we must hold that the admission of Exhibit 35 was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. Chapman v. California, 386 U.S. 18, 87 S.Ct. 824, (1967); United States v. Resnick, 483 F.2d 354 (5th Cir. 1973), cert. denied, 414 U.S. 1008, 94 S.Ct. 370, 38 L.Ed.2d 246 (1973). The information it contained was wholly cumulative; the fact that the check was issued was undisputed, indeed the check itself was admitted into evidence. The fact that Burrell occasionally took checks out of sequence to prepay commissions was shown by both the Hirsch and Co. records admitted into evidence and by the testimony of the cashier. The fact that Burrell used the check to pay another margin account in arrears was shown by the Hirsch and Co. records and the records of Burrell\u2019s bank. The fact that Burrell\u2019s checking account was substantially overdrawn was shown by the records of the bank and not even mentioned in Exhibit 35. If anything, these facts were shown far more clearly in the other exhibits and testimony, for Exhibit 35 was a technical report couched in technical accounting terminology.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-6\">The sole ground offered by the defendant to show Exhibit 35\u2019s prejudicial effect was the fact that it was referred to by the U. S. Attorney in closing argument. We cannot attach the same significance to the reference as the defendant argues \u2014 for despite the fact the U. S. Attorney did refer to Exhibit 35 as showing the facts we have just discussed, in his argument the U. S. Attorney himself stated that all of those facts were proven in one or more other ways as well. The defendant does not cite any fact which Exhibit 35 documents which is not in evidence elsewhere as well. We can perceive no prejudice which the defendant suffered through the erroneous admission of Exhibit 35, and thus do not feel it warrants reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-7\">The defendant also attacks the statement of Special Agent Wanderscheid that the defendant \u201cembezzled\u201d the $34,400.05. The defendant points to the fact that this reference to the defendant\u2019s \u201cembezzlement\u201d was the first time the word was used by any witness. The full statement of Agent Wanderscheid was that this check was money \u201cMr. Burrell received, or took or embezzled from Hirsch and Company,\u201d and the trial court sustained defense\u2019s objection to the use of the term \u201cembezzlement\u201d and instructed the jury to disregard the witness\u2019 characterization of the receipt of the check as \u201cembezzlement.\u201d Essentially what the defendant argues is the sufficiency of the evidence on the point, not the use of the conclusory phrase of Agent Wanderscheid \u2014 and as we have previously said, we feel the evidence was sufficient to permit the jury to find embezzlement and not an innocent and inadvertent receipt of a check erroneously drawn in Burrell\u2019s favor by the cashier. We do not believe the use of the term \u201cembezzlement\u201d by the witness constituted reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-9\">The defendant raises two issues concerning his \u00a7\u00a7 7201 and 7206(1) convictions arising out of his 1968 tax return. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"910\">*910</page-number>The jury found he understated his income in 1968 by over $100,000 primarily due to his failure to report income arising out of two separate sets of transactions concerning a corporation called Meter Maid Industries, Inc.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-4\">Burrell assisted in a merger between North American Cigarette Manufacturing Co. and Meter Maid Laundries, Inc. which took the form of a stock for stock exchange, whereby North American acquired control of Meter Maid Laundries and renamed itself Meter Maid Industries. For his role in facilitating this transaction Burrell received 600,000 restricted common shares of North American on February 20, 1968 \u2014 eventually returning 400,000 of these shares but retaining 200,000 shares for his own use. He disposed of these shares by pledging them as security for a loan he had previously obtained, and the pledgee exchanged them for shares of Meter Maid Industries, Inc. in July, 1968. Burrell reported no income on this transaction. The Government\u2019s expert witness on securities valuation, John O\u2019Farrell, placed a value of $27,500 on these 200,000 shares as of February 20,1968.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-5\">Following the reincorporation of North American as Meter Maid Industries, Burrell engaged in a protracted and successful effort to sell shares in the new corporation. Between February and September of 1968 he sold $73,029.-30 worth of restricted and unrestricted common shares of Meter Maid Industries which he reported as long-term or short-term capital gains. Due to his large capital loss carryforward from previous years,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> were these proceeds to constitute capital gains Burrell would have owed no tax. In fact, as the jury found, he was not authorized to sell the shares of Meter Maid Industries which he sold and thus they did not constitute capital assets and the proceeds on the sales should have been reported as ordinary income.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-6\">Burrell first challenges the method by which O\u2019Farrell valued the North American shares he received. Despite the fact the defendant poses this issue as one involving the use of hearsay records in violation of our <em>en banc </em>decision in United States v. Williams, 447 F.2d 1285 (5th Cir. 1971), actually the only serious issue raised concerns the completeness of the information the expert relied upon, rather than its hearsay components. <em>Williams </em>held that \u201can expert\u2019s testimony need not be based solely upon records which are themselves introduced in evidence so long as the sources of information are of the type reasonably relied on by experts in forming opinions or inferences upon the subject.\u201d 447 F.2d at 1291. The defendant attempts to make the argument that O\u2019Farrell\u2019s use of the so-called \u201cpink sheets\u201d quotations of over-the-counter bids on unlisted securities fell outside the <em>Williams </em>rule. We find this argument invalid. O\u2019Farrell was an expert of long experience, whose expertise was unchallenged by the defense; he explained what \u201cpink sheets\u201d were, and their use in the securities industry \u2014 as indeed Burrell did himself \u2014 and we do not believe any serious question can be raised that over-the-counter bids for North American shares prior to February 20, 1968 can be said to fall outside the rule established in <em>Williams.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1006-8\">Rather the defendant actually repeats the attacks first raised in cross-examination of O\u2019Farrell concerning his failure to examine North American\u2019s assets in addition to researching the stock\u2019s market history and recent trading prices. Admittedly North American was a shell corporation without assets at the time of the merger with Meter Maid Laundries, but O\u2019Farrell explained the market price for a security isn\u2019t necessarily related to the asset value of the corporation, and he testified he studied the market performance of North American prior to the Meter Maid Laundries merger, and thereafter, and his valuation of $0.13% per restricted share was based on the then-existing market for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"911\">*911</page-number>the shares. The defendant\u2019s criticisms of O\u2019Farrell\u2019s failure to make a precise estimate of North American\u2019s assets went to the weight of his testimony, not its admissibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-4\">We should further note Burrell\u2019s counter testimony that the shares he received had no value whatever seemed to contrast starkly with his admitted ability to sell Meter Maid Industries shares shortly thereafter, at prices well above $0.-13% Per share, despite the fact Meter Maid Industries experienced no sudden increase in its assets.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AtO\">We believe the jury was entitled to accept O\u2019Farrell\u2019s estimate of value.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-5\">Finally the defendant argues the Government failed to sustain its burden to prove the understatement of income in 1968 was more than mere understatement and amounted to tax evasion as required for a conviction under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7201.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-6\">The Government clearly must prove that the defendant acted willfully in attempting to evade the payment of taxes in 1968. Spies v. United States, 317 U.S. 492, 63 S.Ct. 364, 87 L.Ed. 418 (1943); <em>see, also, </em>United States v. Bishop, 412 U.S. 346, 93 S.Ct. 2008, 36 L.Ed.2d 941 (1973). It must be shown that the defendant not only understated his income but committed some overt act or acts as part of his attempt to evade or defeat the tax. Such affirmative acts of evasion such as concealment of financial transactions and the providing of false or incomplete information in an attempt to hamper the investigation have been held to constitute sufficient evidence to permit the trier of fact to infer the specific intent to evade taxes. Holland v. United States, 348 U.S. 121, 75 S.Ct. 127, 99 L. Ed. 150 (1954); United States v. Stone, 431 F.2d 1286 (5th Cir. 1970), cert. denied, 401 U.S. 912, 91 S.Ct. 879, 27 L.Ed.2d 811 (1971); Windisch v. United States, 295 F.2d 531 (5th Cir. 1961); McGrew v. United States, 222 F.2d 458 (5th Cir. 1955). A consistent pattern of understatement has been held to present a jury question as to willfulness, United States v. Tunnell, 481 F.2d 149 (5th Cir. 1973); Holland v. United States, <em>supra, </em>as had the failure to report a very substantial amount of income, United States v. Schechter, 475 F.2d 1099 (5th Cir. 1973); Wardlaw v. United States, 203 F.2d 884 (5th Cir. 1953). Finally making false statements 'to Treasury agents has been held to constitute the type of affirmative act of evasion necessary to permit a \u00a7 7201 conviction. United States v. Beacon Brass Co., 344 U.S. 43, 73 S.Ct. 77, 97 L.Ed. 61 (1952); United States v. Newman, 468 F.2d 791 (5th Cir. 1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-9\">The defendant argues the record fails to disclose the types of clandestine financial dealings which the Supreme Court in <em>Spies, supra, </em>described as examples of the type of overt act necessary to justify a conviction under the earlier version of \u00a7 7201 \u2014 such as double bookkeeping, false entries, false documents, and the like \u2014 but in <em>Spies </em>the Supreme Court carefully noted its examples were intended to illustrate the type of conduct required, but not limit the list of overt acts to those described. Burrell did not attempt to maintain secret records or deal under false names, but neither was he completely candid with - the investigators of the Internal Revenue Service \u2014 originally maintaining he made no sales of Meter Maid Industries stock and later supplying a less than complete listing of the transactions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"912\">*912</page-number>he did complete. Further his understatement of income was more than a \u201cmere understatement\u201d of income, it was a substantial understatement \u2014 increasing his tax liability from zero as originally reported to $27,959.14. Given these facts, as we have held before, \u201c[t]he appellant can point, as defendants have done in many similar cases, to the lack of certain badges of fraud. That is not enough. The question of wilfulness is for the jury.\u201d Windisch v. United States, 295 F.2d 531, 532 (5th Cir. 1961).
