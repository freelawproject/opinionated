The District Court\u2019s Memorandum Opinion and Order, reported at 374 F.Supp. 15 (E.D.Mo.1974), set aside that portion of the Referee\u2019s order which required First Federal to turn over the rents from two of the five apartment units in the mortgaged premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b1346-16\">Upon a careful consideration of the record, briefs, and arguments of the parties, the Court has concluded that the decision of the District Court should be affirmed on the basis of the reasons set forth in Judge Regan\u2019s opinion. We think that the District Court correctly applied Missouri law to the undisputed facts in the record. When viewed in the totality of the circumstances appearing in the record, the District Court\u2019s conclusion that First Federal was a mortgagee in possession before bankruptcy is correct and entitled to affirmance upon appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1346-20\">For these reasons the judgment appealed from is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1346-18\">. The Honorable John K. Regan, United States District Judge for the Eastern District of Missouri.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
