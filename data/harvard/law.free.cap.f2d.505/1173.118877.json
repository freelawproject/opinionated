On August 4, 1972, a longshoreman, Norman Burris, filed suit against Global for injuries sustained in an accident aboard a ship owned by Global. Global joined Lavino, the stevedoring concern which was the employer of Burris at the time of his accident, as a third-party defendant, claiming, <em>inter alia, </em>counsel fees and litigation expenses. Prior to trial Lavino and Burris settled; pursuant to their agreement, Burris\u2019 suit against Global was dismissed with prejudice. There remained Global\u2019s indemnification claim against Lavino for counsel fees and other litigation expenses incurred by Global. This action went to trial on November 19, 1973, before Judge Luongo, sitting without a jury. Judge Luongo found that Lavino had breached its warranty of workmanlike service when it brought on board the vessel faulty forklift trucks which emitted oil, but he also found that the unevenness in the stow over which the trucks operated in unloading the ship had contributed to the accident. N.T. 31-32. Because Global had failed to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that Lavino\u2019s breach of contract was the sole cause of Burris\u2019 injury, the court entered judgment for the third-party defendant Lavi-no, relying on Gilchrist v. Mitsui Sem-paku K. K., 405 F.2d 763 (3d Cir. 1968). From this judgment Global now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b1270-14\">This appeal presents the narrow question of the circumstances under which a stevedore is liable to a shipowner for the latter\u2019s litigation expenses in defending a suit brought by an employee of the stevedore for injuries sustained while working onboard the shipowner\u2019s vessel. In Ryan Stevedoring Co. v. Pan-Atlantic S. S. Corp., 350 U.S. 124, 76 S.Ct. 232, 100 L.Ed. 133 (1956), the Supreme Court held that a shipowner can recover indemnification from a stevedore even where, as in the case before us, the shipowner\u2019s failure to correct hazards in the stow may have been partly responsible for the longshoreman\u2019s injury.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> 350 U. S. at 134-135, 76 S.Ct. 232. <em>Accord, </em>Italia Soc. per Azioni di Navigazione v. Oregon Stevedoring Co., 376 U.S. 315, 321, 84 S.Ct. 748, 11 L.Ed.2d 732 (1964); Humble Oil &amp; Refining Co. v. Philadelphia Ship Maintenance Co., 444 F.2d 727, 731 (3d Cir. 1971); Gilchrist v. Mitsui Sempaku K. K., 405 F.2d 763, 767 (3d Cir. 1968). The <em>Ryan </em>decision was an effort to alleviate the shipown<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1175\">*1175</page-number>er\u2019s absolute liability under the unseaworthiness doctrine, see Seas Shipping Co. v. Sieracki, 328 U.S. 85, 66 S.Ct. 872, 90 L.Ed. 1099 (1946), in situations where the shipowner has relinquished control of some operations on the vessel to the stevedore. See Italia Societa v. Oregon Stevedoring Co., <em>supra, </em>376 U.S. at 323 n. 10, 84 S.Ct. 748; Hobart v. Sohio Petroleum Co., 445 F.2d 435, 438 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 404 U.S. 942, 92 S.Ct. 288, 30 L.Ed.2d 256 (1971). While the unseaworthiness doctrine tends to ensure seamen and longshoremen recovery for their injuries, see <em>Seas Shipping, supra, </em>328 U.S. at 93-95, 66 S.Ct. 872, it also places the loss on the party least able to police the risk of injury during the time that the longshoremen are on board. By allowing the shipowner to recover indemnification from the stevedore, the <em>Ryan </em>doctrine reallocates some of the loss to the stevedore, who, as the longshoreman\u2019s employer and the person in immediate control of loading and unloading operations, is in a better position to minimize the risk. See <em>Italia Societa, supra; Hobart, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1271-4\">The Supreme Court has never been called upon to decide whether litigation expenses incurred by a shipowner in defending a suit brought by a longshoreman are included in the damages recoverable under <em>Ryan. </em>However', the <em>Ryan </em>Court did cite Restatement of Contracts, \u00a7 334, in its analysis of the contract between shipowner and stevedore. See <em>Ryan, supra, </em>350 U.S. at 129 n. 3, 76 S.Ct. 232. Section 334 provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1271-5\">\u201cIf a breach of contract is the cause of litigation between the plaintiff and third parties that the defendant had reason to foresee when the contract was made, the plaintiff\u2019s reasonable expenditures in such litigation are included in estimating his damages.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A9T\">It thus appears that in creating the shipowner\u2019s right to sue for indemnification, the Court contemplated that the shipowner's litigation expenses would be part of the damages. This view is consistent with the ordinary law of indemnification, see A. C. Israel Commodity Co. v. American West African Line, Inc., 397 F.2d 170, 172 (3d Cir.), cert. denied, 393 U.S. 978, 89 S.Ct. 446, 21 L.Ed.2d 439 (1968), and has been adopted repeatedly in decisions of this court and other circuits subsequent to <em>Ryan. </em>See Guarracino v. Luckenbach Steamship Co., 333 F.2d 646, 648 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 379 U.S. 946, 85 S.Ct. 439, 13 L.Ed.2d 543 (1964); Brown v. San Alberto CIA Armadora S.A., 305 F.2d 602, 603 (3d Cir. 1962); Rogers v. United States Lines Co., 303 F.2d 295, 298-299 (3d Cir.), cert. denied, 371 U.S. 876, 83 S.Ct. 148, 9 L.Ed.2d 114 (1962); Paliaga v. Luckenbach Steamship Co., 301 F.2d 403, 407-411 (2d Cir. 1962). See also H. Baer, Admiralty Law of the Supreme Court, \u00a7 8-4 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b1271-8\">Contrary to the approach of the foregoing cases, the appellee relies on language in Gilchrist v. Mitsui Sempaku K. K., <em>supra, </em>where this court stated that the shipowner\u2019s counsel fees should be indemnified only if the stevedore\u2019s breach of contract is the sole responsible cause of the longshoreman\u2019s injury. See <em>Gilchrist, supra, </em>405 F.2d at 769.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> For this proposition, the <em>Gilchrist </em>court relied on dicta in Ellerman Lines, Ltd. v. Atlantic &amp; Gulf Stevedores, Inc., 339 F.2d 673 (3d Cir. 1964), cert. denied, 382 U.S. 812, 86 S.Ct. 23, 15 L.Ed.2d 60 (1965). In <em>Ellerman, </em>the shipowner had alleged that the stevedore\u2019s breach of warranty was the sole responsible cause of the longshoreman\u2019s injury and the court observed in passing that, if this allegation were true, the shipowner would be able to recover its litigation expenses as part of the damages in its indemnification action against the stevedore. <em>Id. </em>at 674. This was not a holding that the shipowner could not recover its litigation expenses if the stevedore\u2019s breach were not the sole cause of the injury, and the <em>Ellerman </em>court cited with approval the <em>Guarraeino </em>and <em>Brown cas</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1176\">*1176</page-number>es, <em>supra, </em>in which the courts had held that litigation expenses are a part of the damages in a shipowner\u2019s indemnification action' without requiring the stevedore\u2019s breach to be the sole responsible cause of the longshoreman\u2019s injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b1272-4\">The <em>Gilchrist </em>court was undoubtedly motivated by the extraordinary circumstances of that case. In <em>Gilchrist, </em>the shipowner had failed to introduce at trial evidence regarding the amount of its counsel fees. In a post-trial memorandum, the shipowner requested that \u201cthe judgment be formed to include the shipowner\u2019s counsel fees and expenses in defending the principal action.\u201d <em>Gilchrist, supra, </em>405 F.2d at 768. Although this request was not granted, the district court reserved the question of the shipowner\u2019s right to counsel fees and, over a year after the entry of judgment, informed counsel that if they could not agree on the amount of counsel fees, the issue would be brought to trial before a jury. <em>Id., </em>405 F.2d at 768-769. The case thus raised difficult questions concerning <em>res judicata </em>and the power of the district court to grant a separate trial on its own motion more than ten days after the entry of judgment. See F.R.Civ.P. 59. The <em>Gilchrist </em>court admitted that, by adopting the language in <em>Ellerman, </em>it would be able to avoid these difficult issues.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Id., </em>405 F.2d at 769.</p>\n<p id=\"b1272-8\">The only cases which have followed <em>Gilchrist </em>have similarly involved exceptional circumstances which required the courts to create an \u201cequitable modification of the normal rule of indemnification.\u201d Farrell Lines, Inc. v. Carolina Shipping Co., Nos. 73-2079/80, slip opinion at 9 (4th Cir., June 7, 1974). Farrell involved a \u201cunique\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> factual situation in which the shipowner sued the stevedore who loaded the ship for the liability and litigation expense the shipowner had incurred as the result of injuries suffered by the employee of the stevedore who unloaded the ship. In this situation, the court of appeals found that it had not been error for the district court to deny the shipowner recovery from the loading stevedore of the litigation expenses it incurred in an earlier action involving the shipowner, the longshoreman, and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1177\">*1177</page-number>unloading stevedore.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Similarly, in Humble Oil &amp; Refining Co. v. Philadelphia Ship Maintenance Co., 444 F.2d 727 (3d Cir. 1971), where this court directed the district court\u2019s attention to the <em>Gilchrist </em>holding for purposes of remand <em>(id., </em>405 F.2d at 737, n. 19), the principal suit by the longshoreman against the shipowner was not consolidated with the indemnification action of the shipowner against the stevedore. To reach its conclusion that the jury verdict in the principal action did not bind the stevedore in the subsequent indemnification action, the court found that the stevedore\u2019s refusal of the shipowner\u2019s tender of defense in the principal action did not collaterally estop the stevedore from reliti-gating, in the subsequent indemnification action, the original jury\u2019s findings. <em>Id. </em>at 735. In view of' this holding, there was no reason to require the stevedore to pay the shipowner\u2019s costs in defending the principal action.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1273-5\">Since the district court did not include in its findings any similarly extenuating circumstances in the instant case, we find that the normal rule of indemnification, stated by this court in <em>Rogers </em>and <em>Brown, supra, </em>should be applied to the facts on which the district court reached its judgment.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In reaching this decision, we are not unmindful of Lavino\u2019s argument that <em>Gilchrist </em>represents a general relaxation of the strictness of the <em>Ryan </em>doctrine. It must be noted, however, that in <em>Humble Oil, supra, </em>444 F.2d at p. 731, Judge Aldisert carefully described the limitations inherent in the <em>Ryan </em>doctrine:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1273-10\">\u201cIn Weyerhaeuser S.S. Co. v. Nacirema Operating Co., 355 U.S. 563, 78 S.Ct. 438, 2 L.Ed.2d 491 (1958), the Supreme Court, again faced with facts indicating that the stevedore was substantially responsible for a longshoreman\u2019s injuries, reaffirmed the shipowner\u2019s right to indemnification created in <em>Ryan, </em>but not without reservation: \u2018If [the stevedore] rendered a substandard performance which led to foreseeable liability of [the shipowner] , the latter was entitled to indemnity <em>absent conduct on its part sufficient to preclude recovery.\u2019 </em>Id. at 567, 78 S.Ct. at 441 (emphasis supplied).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1273-11\">The court in <em>Humble Oil </em>remanded to determine \u201cwhether the shipowner\u2019s breach of his absolute duty to furnish a safe and seaworthy vessel so prevented or hindered the stevedore from complet<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1178\">*1178</page-number>ing its performance that the subsequent breach of warranty by the stevedore may be deemed excused.\u201d <em>Id., </em>444 F.2d at 733. We believe that this language of Judge Aldisert states the proper test for liability in the instant case as well. Considered in this light, the appellee is not justified in characterizing the <em>Ryan </em>doctrine and its progeny as being unduly harsh.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1274-4\">The appellee finally contends that the court should stay its hand because the issue raised by this case will soon be mooted by the recent amendments to the Longshoremen\u2019s and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, Act of October 27, 1972, Pub.L. 92-576, \u00a7 18(a), 86 Stat. 1263, codified at 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 905(b), which went into effect November 26, 1972. While there can be no doubt that those amendments rationalize the relative liabilities of shipowners and stevedores by replacing maritime concepts of liability with \u201ca new cause of action for negligence in which a shipowner is not to be held liable as a third party unless the former\u2019s negligence was such as would render a land-based third party in non-maritime pursuits liable under similar circumstances,\u201d Vickery, Some Impacts of the 1972 Amendments to the Longshoremen\u2019s &amp; Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, Insurance Counsel Journal, January 1974, at 63, 64, these amendments do not apply to the instant case,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and cannot be used to justify an inconsistent interpretation of the settled law of indemnification under <em>Ryan, </em>which does apply to the instant case. Since we do not believe that the facts before us justify application of the <em>Gilchrist </em>\u201csole responsibility\u201d test, the district court judgment will be reversed.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1274-9\">The November 19, 1973, judgment will be reversed and the cause remanded for proceedings consistent with this opinion. Costs to be taxed against the appellee.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1270-12\">. The primary significance of the <em>Ryan </em>case was its holding that the shipowner\u2019s indemnification action lies in contract, so that it is not barred by \u00a7 5 of the Longshoremen\u2019s and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, 44 Stat. 1426, as amended, 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 905(a). See <em>Ryan, supra, </em>350 U.S. at 128-132, 76 S.Ct. 232.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1271-9\">. See note 3 below.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1272-5\">. The pertinent language in <em>Gilchrist, supra, </em>405 F.2d at 769, is :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1272-6\">\u201cIn the case of Ellerman Lines, Ltd. v. Atlantic &amp; Gulf Stevedores, Inc., 339 F.2d 673, Judge Hastie, now Chief Judge of this Court, said at p. 674: \u2018If conduct of [the stevedoring company! in violation of its warranty to [the shipowner] was the <em>sole </em>responsible cause of [the longshoreman\u2019s] injury, as the libel alleges, the expense to which [the shipowner] is subjected in defending [the longshoreman\u2019s] suit against it to recover for that injury is an element of damages caused by the [steve-doring company\u2019s] breach of warranty, even if [the shijjowner] succeeds in defeating [the longshoreman\u2019s] claim.\u2019 (Cited cases omitted and emphasis added.) There has been no showing in the actions here involved that the conduct of the stevedor-ing company was the sole responsible cause of the plaintiff-longshoreman\u2019s injury. Therefore, the shipowner was not entitled to recover t'..e expenses to which it was subjected in defending the plaintiff-longshoreman\u2019s action against it from the stevedoring company. Hence we need not determine whether the verdict was res adjudicata on the defending expense issue and whether the district court had the power to sever that issue and grant a separate jury trial on its own motion, and even though it did have such power in this action, whether it had to be exercised within ten days from the entry of judgment on the verdict.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1272-10\">This holding was never appealed to the Supreme Court. The stevedore filed a petition for writ of certiorari, but since it had prevailed on the counsel fee issue it did not include that issue in its petition. The questions presented by the petition for writ of certiorari appear in the joint appendix filed in this action at 48a. The Supreme Court denied the petition. Jarka Corp. v. Mitsui Sempaku K. K., 394 U.S. 920, 89 S.Ct. 1195, 22 L.Ed.2d 453 (1969). It is noted that Judge Hastie wrote the opinion in Miller v. A/B Svenska Amerika Linien, 454 F.2d 1094 (3d Cir. 1971), where the court pointed out at note 2, p. 1096:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1272-11\">\u201cWe do not reach the question of indemnifying stevedore\u2019s liability for the shipowner\u2019s litigation expenses where stevedore and shipowner shared responsibility for longshoreman\u2019s injury, a situation considered in <em>Gilchrist </em>. . .</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1272-12\">. See <em>Farrell, supra </em>at p. 9 of slip opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1273-6\">. Although the court in <em>Farrell </em>based its decision on the ground that the loading stevedore was not solely responsible for the longshoreman's injuries. <em>Farrell, supra </em>at p. 9 of slip opinion, the result might also be explained on the ground that the loading stevedore was entitled to contribution from the vessel as a joint tortfeasor. <em>Cf. </em>Cooper Stevedoring Co. v. Fritz Kopke, Inc., 417 U.S. <em>106, </em>94 S.Ct. 2174, 40 L.Ed.2d 694 (1974).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1273-7\">. The last sentence of the last footnote in <em>Humble </em>is not controlling, both because it refers to \u201ccosts,\u201d rather than litigation expenses, and because further proceedings on remand were necessary to determine the controlling facts. Furthermore, in Miller v. A/B Svenska Amerika Linien, 454 F.2d 1094 (3d Cir. 1971), decided after <em>Humble, </em>this court, having found that the stevedore\u2019s conduct was the sole responsible cause of the accident, <em>id. </em>at 1096, explicitly left undecided the continuing vitality of the <em>Gilchrist </em>language. <em>Id. </em>at 1096 n. 2 (quoted in part at note 3 above).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1273-12\">. See also Paliaga v. Luckenbach Steamship Co., 301 F.2d 403 (2d Cir. 1962). The trial court\u2019s decision was based solely on its finding that Global failed to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that Lavino\u2019s breach of warranty was not the sole responsible cause of Burris\u2019 injuries. N.T. 31. Whether other aspects of the case, for example, Global\u2019s refusal to allow Lavino to undertake the defense contingent upon Global\u2019s waiver of costs and expenses prior to Lavino\u2019s undertaking the defense, N.T. 22, constitute the sort of unusual circlumstances which should affect Global\u2019s indemnification, we leave to the determination of the trial court on remand. See also note 8, <em>infra. </em>We note in this regard that the trial judge did not prejudge the amount of counsel fees and other expenses to which Global would be entitled should this court reach a different conclusion than the trial judge on the <em>Gilchrist </em>issue. See N.T. 33-34.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1274-5\">. A further limitation on the <em>Ryan </em>doctrine is the principle that the shipowner is entitled to recover only the litigation expenses incurred in defending the action brought by the longshoreman, but not the expenses incurred in prosecuting his indemnification action against the stevedore. See Rogers v. United States Lines Co., 303 F.2d 295, 299 (3d Cir. 1962); H. Baer, Admiralty Law of the Supreme Court, \u00a7 8-4 (1969).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b1274-13\">.

We note that the district court understandably considered that it was \u201cbound\u201d (N.T. 32) by the language used in <em>Gilchrist, supra, </em>which we now hold must be limited to the facts presented by that case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b1274-10\">JAMES HUNTER, III, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"A8q\">(concurring):</p>\n<p id=\"b1274-11\">I agree with the majority opinion insofar as it reverses the judgment of the district court and remands for consideration of whether, under <em>Ryan </em>and <em>Weyerhaeuser, </em>Global\u2019s conduct might have been such as to preclude recovery in this action. However, rather than try to limit <em>Gilchrist </em>to its facts, I would prefer to have this Circuit call an <em>en banc </em>hearing to reconsider its validity. I believe that the \u201csole responsible cause\u201d test adopted by <em>Gilchrist </em>is contrary to general principles of indemnity, which permit indemnification for the full loss suffered by the indemnitee. Where the indemnitor\u2019s breach has caused the indemnitee to incur reasonable costs and legal expenses in connection with the defense of the principal action, those costs and expenses are recoverable as part of the loss suffered by the indemnitee. This general principle is explicitly adopted in section 334 of the Restatement of Contracts, cited by the Supreme Court in <em>Ryan, </em>and had been recognized in several other decisions of this Circuit. See <em>A. C. Israel, supra; Brown, supra; Rogers, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1274-12\">Nowhere do any of these authorities carve out a special rule for legal fees and expenses where the fault between the indemnitor and indemnitee is mutually shared, and such a rule is hard to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1179\">*1179</page-number>accept logically. So long as the relative faults are such that the shipowner-in-demnitee can still recover the full amount of any judgment paid over to the injured longshoreman,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> there is no reason why he should not be entitled to recover counsel fees and expenses incurred in defending against the principal action, since the incurring of such costs and expenses is a foreseeable result of the stevedore\u2019s breach. This rule does not seem unduly harsh, because the shipowner must still prove that the stevedore breached its warranty of workmanlike performance and that the breach was the proximate cause of the longshoreman\u2019s injury. <em>Gilchrist </em>is thus contrary to general principles of indemnity and to cases from other circuits which awarded counsel fees and expenses despite specific findings of negligence on the part of the shipowner. See, e. g., Guidry v. Texaco, Inc., 430 F.2d 781 (5th Cir. 1970); Nicroli v. den Norske Afrika Og Australielinie, 332 F.2d 651 (2d Cir. 1964); De Gioia v. United States Lines Co., 304 F.2d 421 (2d Cir. 1962). Furthermore, the precedential value of <em>Gilchrist </em>is somewhat weakened by the fact that, as the majority notes, it adopted the \u201csole responsible cause\u201d test by relying on dicta in the <em>Ellerman </em>case in which the latter court was merely repeating an allegation made in the pleadings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1275-5\">I agree with the majority that there may be unusual circumstances which would justify the denial of attorney\u2019s fees and expenses despite the right to recover indemnity proper. However, for such circumstances to create \u201can equitable modification of the normal rule of indemnification,\u201d it would appear necessary that those circumstances be such as to require modification so as to prevent undue hardship to one of the parties. I agree that <em>Farrell, supra, </em>might well be such a case, since it involved two stevedores, both of whom, along with the shipowner, had been found partially negligent. I do not see how the facts in <em>Gilchrist </em>required such a modification, as there was no logical nexus between the unusual circumstances present in that case and any harshness that might result from application of the general rule of indemnification. As the majority notes, the court in <em>Gilchrist </em>applied the \u201csole responsible cause\u201d test in part to avoid resolving the difficult issues of <em>res judicata </em>and the trial court\u2019s grant of a separate trial. While these unusual circumstances may have motivated the <em>Gilchrist </em>court in reaching its decision, I do not see how they would justify a departure from or a modification of the established law of indemnity. In short, I am concerned that today\u2019s decision does not offer a clear framework as to what kinds of circumstances would justify \u201can equitable modification of the normal rule of indemnification.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1275-9\">I concur in the majority\u2019s disposition of this case, however, since it reverses the district court judgment and since I agree that the district court should consider on remand whether Global\u2019s conduct might constitute such unusual circumstances as to affect its right of indemnification. See note 7 <em>supra. </em>While I disagree with the majority\u2019s distinguishing of <em>Gilchrist, </em>I believe that any uncertainty that the majority\u2019s opinion may create for other litigants is minimal in light of the recent amendments to the Longshoremen\u2019s and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. Those amendments seem to have mooted the issues raised by this case for accidents occurring after November 26, 1972, by prohibiting shipowner indemnity actions against stevedore/employers.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1275-6\">. While the Supreme Court in <em>Weyerhaeuser </em>held that fault on the part of the shipowner does not necessarily preclude recovery of indemnity from the stevedore, it recognized that conduct by the shipowner may nevertheless be such as to preclude recovery. <em>Weyerhaeuser, supra, </em>355 U.S. at 567, 78 S.Ct. 438.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
