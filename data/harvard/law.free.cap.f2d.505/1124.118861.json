Foley, <em>Chief Judge, </em>convicting him of failure to report for induction in the armed forces of the United States, in violation of Section 12(a) of the Military Selective Service Act of 1967, 50 U.S.C. App. \u00a7 462(a) (1970). He was adjudged a Young Adult Offender, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4209 (1970); imposition of a prison sentence was suspended; and he was placed on probation for a period of two years, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 5010(a), with the special condition that he perform work contributing to the national interest during his probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1221-10\">The only issue open to us on this appeal<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> is the correctness of Judge Foley\u2019s holding that a I-S(C) deferment terminates on completion of a registrant\u2019s actual course of study for the school year, rather than 12 months from the date the registrant begins his course of study as claimed by appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1221-15\">We agree with Judge Foley\u2019s interpretation of \u201cacademic year\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> since the purpose of a I-S(C) deferment is fully served on completion of the actual course of study for the school year. We assumed that to be the proper interpretation in United States ex rel. Vacca v. Commanding Officer, 446 F.2d 1079, 1083 (2 Cir. 1971). We see no reason for departing from that view here. See McLain v. Local Board 47, 439 F.2d 737, 741-42 (8 Cir. 1971); Nestor v. Hershey, 425 F.2d 504, 512-13 (D.C.Cir. 1969); Marowitz v. Local Board 12 (N.D.N.Y.1973); Peller v. Local Board 65, 313 F.Supp. 100, 103-04 (N.D.Ind. 1970) . To the extent that Walsh v. Local Board 10, 305 F.Supp. 1274 (S.D.N.Y.1969), construed \u201cacademic year\u201d to mean the 12 month period following the beginning of the registrant\u2019s course of study, we disapprove that construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1221-18\">In the instant case, appellant\u2019s induction order was mailed to him on August 24, 1970, some two months after the end of his academic year in June, but was returned by appellant to the local board on September 15. Judge Foley found that the government had proven beyond a reasonable doubt all the requisite elements of a knowing and wilful refusal to report for induction as required by law. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1221-19\">We affirm on the well reasoned opinions of Judge Foley, reported at 383 F.Supp. 353 (N.D.N.Y.1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b1221-20\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1221-12\">. Appellant\u2019s argument that, as a Mohawk Indian and as such a member of the Six Nations of Indians (although born in Hanover, New Hampshire, the son of a United States citizen), he is exempt from service under the Military Selective Service Act of 1967, is foreclosed by our decision in Ex parte Green, 123 F.2d 862 (2 Cir. 1941), cert. denied, 316 U.S. 668 (1942), to which we continue to adhere.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1221-22\">.
