Suarez had been charged in a three-count indictment with possession with intent to distribute, distribution, and conspiracy to distribute one-eighth of a kilogram of cocaine. A co-defendant, Alberto Vera, pleaded guilty to one count of the indictment and Suarez went on trial on October 11, 1973. Count three, which charged Suarez with abetting Vera\u2019s possession with intent to distribute, was dismissed by Judge Dooling at the conclusion of the Government\u2019s direct case. The rest was given to the jury on the two counts of conspiracy and the abetting of Vera in distributing the cocaine. The jury failed to reach an agreement, Judge Dooling declared a mistrial, and the trial was terminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-18\">At the conclusion of the Government\u2019s case, counsel for Suarez had moved for judgments of acquittal pursuant to Rule 29, Fed.R.Crim.P. The motion was denied by Judge Dooling but, after the mistrial, the motions for acquittal on both counts were renewed by counsel for Suarez, and granted in the memorandum and order of Judge Dooling.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-19\">While it is clear that the Criminal Appeals Act, as amended by the Omnibus Crime Control Act of 1970 (now 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3731) was intended to authorize an appeal by the Government from an order of a district court terminating a criminal case as far as is constitutionally permissible, in our view the Double Jeopardy Clause prohibits further prosecution. The issue has been exhaustively discussed in our recent opinion, United States v. Jenkins, 490 F.2d 868 (2d Cir. 1973), cert. granted, 417 U.S. 908, 94 S.Ct. 2603, 41 L.Ed.2d 211 (1974). While this case and others presenting similar questions are present<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>ly on review before the Supreme Court,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> we see no reason to delay our decision here. In <em>Jenkins, </em>Judge Lumbard\u2019s dissent was based on the lower court\u2019s characterization of the order appealed from as the dismissal of an indictment. He agreed that if the decision below had been described as an acquittal, the Double Jeopardy Clause would prohibit the appeal. <em>Jenkins, supra, </em>490 F.2d at 881. No such problem exists here. Judge Dooling\u2019s order provides: \u201cOrdered that the motion of the defendant, Juan Suarez, for a judgment of acquittal is granted.\u201d As Justice Harlan pointed out in United States v. Sisson, 399 U.S. 267, 290, 90 S.Ct. 2117, 2129, 26 L.Ed.2d 608 (1970) it makes no difference that \u201cin this case it was the judge \u2014 not the jury \u2014who made the factual determinations . [Jjudges, like juries, can acquit defendants . . . .\u201d Further, there is no doubt here that Judge Dooling\u2019s ruling was based on the evidence presented at the trial, which he deemed insufficient to establish active participation by Suarez in the venture, so as to constitute conspiracy or abetting. As Judge Friendly pointed out in <em>Jenkins, supra, </em>490 F.2d at 878, even though the lower court ruling be based upon an erroneous legal ground, a new trial is prevented by the Double Jeopardy Clause. We do not reach and express no opinion on the merits of the position taken below. There has been a legal determination of innocence on the basis of the facts, adduced at' the trial, relating to the general issues of the case, and therefore on the basis of <em>Jenkins </em>and the authorities relied upon in the majority opinion, the appeal is dismissed for lack of jurisdiction by virtue of the constitutional ban of the Double Jeopardy Clause.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b264-5\">. In addition to Jenkins, the applicable cases are United States v. Wilson, 492 F.2d 1345 (3d Cir. 1973), cert. granted, 417 U.S. 908, 94 S.Ct. 2603, 41 L.Ed.2d 211 (1974) (does Doable <em>Jeopardy </em>bar a <em>government </em>appeal from a district court order, entered after a jury verdict of guilty, dismissing an indictment on the ground of unnecessary pre-indictment delay), and Serfass v. United States, 492 F.2d 388 (3d Cir. 1974), cert. granted, 416 U.S. 955, 94 S.Ct. 1967, 40 L.Ed.2d 304 (1974) (does Double Jeopardy bar a government appeal from an order, entered prior to the empanelling of a jury, dismissing an indictment on the basis of a legal ruling by the district court after examination of records and affidavits setting forth the evidence to be adduced at trial).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
