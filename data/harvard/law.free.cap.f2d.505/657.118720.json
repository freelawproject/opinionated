The trial court applied the proper legal test, whether \u00fase of the allegedly infringing mark is likely to confuse consumers as to the source of the product. American Foods, Inc. v. Golden Flake, Inc., 312 F.2d 619 (5th Cir. 1963). The evidence consisted largely of conflicting testimony by each party\u2019s witnesses as to whether such confusion was likely. The district judge rested his finding of no infringement not only on his evaluation of this testimony, but also on the lack of direct competition between the parties <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>and the visual dissimilarity of the marks. We cannot say he was clearly erroneous in so ruling, and the judgment is therefore</p>\n<p id=\"ABN\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
