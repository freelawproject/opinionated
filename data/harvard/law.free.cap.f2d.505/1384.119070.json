The factual issues were sharply in dispute; this required the District Court to submit such issues to the jury. Defendant engaged in just too much activity, not only in this country but also in Turkey, to make plausible its claims that the minds of the parties had not met on the terms and provisions of the contract or that its agents lacked authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b1481-13\">After the minds of the parties had met, defendant appointed a resident agent in Turkey, applied to Petroleum Administration of Turkey and secured an extension of time within which to drill the well, and attempted to interest some four hundred other people to participate in its project.</p>\n<p id=\"b1481-14\">We are further of the opinion that the verdict of the jury is supported by sufficient evidence; that the Court did not commit prejudicial error in its admission of evidence, nor in its instructions to the jury; and that the correspondence, cablegrams and telegrams passing between the parties were sufficient to take the case out of the operation of the Ohio statute of frauds.</p>\n<p id=\"b1481-15\">The judgment of the District Court is therefore affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
