Offenses and Penalties). Count I charged failure to report for induction into the armed forces, Count II failure to keep the Local Board advised of appellant\u2019s current address. The case was tried, upon consent, by the court without a jury. At the close of the case Count II was dismissed for failure of proof, the government consenting thereto. The case was then submitted to the court upon written argument. The court\u2019s decision is contained in its \u201cMemorandum and Order.\u201d Appellant was convicted on Count I. Imposition of sentence as to imprisonment was suspended, probation for a period of five years was imposed as was a fine of $3,000 payable at the rate of $50 per month. From the judgment of conviction, appellant appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-15\">On appeal, appellant raises three points of error (1) admission of an unidentified entry in his Selective Service file of his failure to report for induction; (2) failure of the Local Board to grant appellant an interview with its Medical Advisor; and (3) failure of the Local Board to consider his student deferment status.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-16\">The facts are quite simple. Chronologically, on December 19, 1968, appellant was classified 1-A; on May 13, 1969, he received his pre-induction physical examination; on May 21, 1969, he was examined by a psychiatrist; and on June 18, 1970, he was ordered to report for induction on July 16, 1970.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-17\">The government\u2019s proof to establish the charges contained in Count I consists solely of appellant\u2019s original Selective Service file which was produced by Mrs. Magdalene Barker, Executive Secretary for some six years of Local Board #74 at Yisalia, California. Mrs. Barker testified that she was the custodian of the original file and that the entries therein were made by the personnel of the Board, i.e., the staff and the Board members. The salient entry appears on page 11 under the heading \u201cMinutes of Actions by Local Board and Appeal Board and an Appeal to the President,\u201d as follows: \u201cJUL 24 1970 Failed to Report for Induction on 16 JULY 1970.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b592-18\">Appellant argues that this entry, since the entrant was unidentified and unknown, was inadmissible hearsay and, despite 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1733(a),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> should have been excluded as \u201cdouble hearsay.\u201d This proof, appellant claims, was too vague and tenuous as a matter of law to remove reasonable doubt as to appellant\u2019s failure to report.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>The district court\u2019s opinion held that the \u201chearsay objection to the admissibility of \u2018Failed to Report\u2019 being stamped in the file has been laid to rest by United States v. Richardson, 9th Cir. #73-1245 [484 F.2d 1046], which found it admissible under 28 U.S.C. 1733(a).\u201d The Court further said that the entry \u201cwas corroborated by the fact that defendant was in court and would have been in the Army if in fact he had reported.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">In <em>Richardson, supra, </em>the trial court found Richardson guilty of a failure to report for physical examination and not guilty of a failure to report for induction. The majoi\u2019ity held that a stamped entry \u201cFailed to Report,\u201d on the minute sheet of his Selective Service file was admissible under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1733(a), citing United States v. Hudson, 479 F.2d 251 (9th Cir. 1972) and United States v. Grans, 472 F.2d 597 (9th Cir. 1972) in support thereof. Judge Hufstedler in her dissent in <em>Richardson, supra, </em>although recognizing that <em>\u201cHudson </em>permitted the admission of an anonymous hearsay entry contained in Selective Service file <em>* * </em>expressed the view that <em>\u201cHudson </em>is plainly wrong\u201d both for reasons given by Judge Lumbard in his dissent therein and also because she believed that it was in conflict with decisions in this Circuit and with Supreme Court authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-8\">There is no doubt that the creation of a status of sanctity to \u201cBooks or records of account or minutes of proceedings of any department or agency of the United States\u201d thereby making them \u201cadmissible to prove the act, transaction or occurrence as a memorandum of which the same were made or kept.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1733(a), is a far cry from the days of the \u201cshop book\u201d rule. However, times have changed\u2014 particularly in government and in the enormous expansion of its agencies with their thousands of employees. It would be utterly impractical in most cases to attempt to identify, as has been suggested, the persons who made the entries or ascertain the information, and source thereof, upon which the entries were based. Probably no one in any department would be able, after the expiration of a comparatively few years, to even trace the name of the entrant or the nature or the extent of his or her knowledge. But we need not confront these broader problems in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-10\">As stated in 5 Wigmore on Evidence \u00a7 1635 (3d ed. 1940) there are exceptions to any personal knowledge requirement in</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-11\">eases in which the officer\u2019s duty clearly does involve ascertainment of facts occurring out of his presence and requiring his resort to sources of information other than his own senses of observation; for example, an assessor\u2019s record of the value of real estate and of its occupancy, or a registrar of voters\u2019 record of electors\u2019 residences. When such a duty clearly exists, the general doctrine above, that a witness should have personal knowledge, need not stand in the way, for (as already noted) it has its conceded limitations; and where the officer is vested with a duty to ascertain for himself by proper investigation, this duty should be sufficient to override the general principle.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b593-12\"><em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 1635, at 531. This exception to the \u201cpersonal knowledge\u201d rule is consistent with the fundamental theory underlying the official documents exception to the hearsay rule, that where \u201can official duty exists to make an accurate statement, . . . this special and weighty duty will usually suffice as a motive to incite the officer to its fulfillment. . . . It is the influence of the official duty, broadly considered, which is taken as the sufficient element of trustworthiness, justifying the acceptance of the hearsay statement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1632, at 514.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-15\">The regulations that prescribe the relationship between the induction center and the local boards that feed registrants to it for induction impose official duties upon the local boards that serve to insure the reliability of the kind of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>entry that is the subject of this appeal. The local board is responsible for assembling registrants for delivery to the induction center. Absences at the forwarding site are to be noted on the Delivery List, Selective Service System Form 261, which is sent to the induction center along with the registrants. 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1632.15(a) (1974). After induction proceedings have taken place, the commanding officer of the induction center is required to return the original Form 261 to the local board, \u201cindicating in column 4 the disposition of each registrant forwarded for induction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1632.20(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b594-4\">Thus the regulations impose a duty on the commanding officer of the induction center to transmit facts on Form 261 to the local board that are based either on the commanding officer\u2019s own perception or that of his subordinates. The regulations also impose a duty on the local board to file this information. This duty to report and record suggests a line of responsibility analogous to and perhaps stronger than that running from subordinate to superior, and information running along this line of responsibility should be recognized as equally reliable.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">The record does not affirmatively establish Form 261 as the source of the entry in appellant\u2019s file. But even if that form was not the source of the information, it is reasonable to infer a duty on the part of the executive secretary or other staff personnel of the Local Board to verify a failure to report against the Form 261, either at the time of the entry in the registrant\u2019s file or before forwarding his file to regional or national headquarters for a decision on whether or not the registrant should be prosecuted. The \u201cofficial duty to make an accurate statement\u201d in a registrant\u2019s file \u201cwill usually suffice as a motive to incite the officer to its fulfillment.\u201d <em>Cf. </em>Wigmore on Evidence \u00a7 1632, at 514. Entries made pursuant to that duty are sufficiently trustworthy to justify their admission into evidence in a case such as this.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">If every entry has to be proved through the mouth of the entrant who is then to be subjected to cross-examination, then such books and records would be of value only to refresh a witness\u2019 recollection. This would not appear to be the intent of Congress in enacting section 1733.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-7\">The district court\u2019s finding that the Local Board has no reason to review appellant\u2019s medical status in view of the fact that he \u201cwas found medically qualified for induction, even after special psychiatric consultation by the Armed Forces doctors,\u201d is supported by the record as is the finding that on the facts appellant was not entitled to a II-S (student deferment) classification.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-8\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b592-13\">. \u00a7 1733.
