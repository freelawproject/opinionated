Appellant is a corporation engaged in the food brokerage business, acting as an independent sales agent in northern California for various food processors and manufacturers. Appel-lee, among other things, is a corporation engaged in processing and manufacturing food.</p>\n<p id=\"b1143-13\">FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1143-14\">A summary of the facts, stated favorably for appellee, is as follows: In 1952 when Van Camp Sea Food Company, a predecessor of appellant, decided to change its marketing scheme from direct sales' to brokerage, J. Thomas Trixler, president of appellant, resigned as an employee of Van Camp and became its broker and a broker for other food processors. Trixler then incorporated his business, and his company was orally appointed by Van Camp as broker for northern California. Later, the appellant company was formed and took over the California operations of its predecessor. Since that time it has been managed by Trixler, its president and principal shareholder.</p>\n<p id=\"b1143-15\">In 1963, appellee acquired Van Camp, the latter continuing as an administrative division of the former. Trixler continued as broker for the Van Camp tuna products under an arrangement which was not formally expressed, either orally or in writing. From 1953, appellee, in accordance with accepted business practice, conducted regular studies to, determine the relative economics of marketing its products through brokers as opposed to direct sales. In the early fifties, it marketed all of its consumer products through a direct sales force. Later, in the mid-fifties, it changed courses and by 1960 all of its consumer products were marketed by brokers. By the use of brokers, appellee was unable to give its junior management personnel sufficient sales experience to enable them effectively to supervise and work with food brokers. Consequently, in 1965, appellee established a direct sales force in St. Louis to provide a training ground for sales management personnel. This force failed to provide a sufficient number of trained personnel, and in 1966 another force for training purposes was established in Los Angeles.</p>\n<p id=\"b1144-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1048\">*1048</page-number>In 1965, and subsequently, appellant inquired from time to time as to appel-lee\u2019s overall policy concerning brokers and was told that appellee was \u201cbroker minded\u201d or \u201cbroker oriented\u201d and that there were no plans to terminate appellant. To this date, no national sales force has been established by appellee, none is planned, and most of its tuna products are still marketed through brokers. Even after the establishment of the direct sales force in Los Angeles in 1966, there was no decision or plan to extend the direct sales training force until February, 1968. In the so-called \u201cOperation February\u201d report, San Francisco, Philadelphia and Baltimore-Washington were selected as feasible markets for the institution of a direct sales training area. The recommendation that San Francisco be selected was dated April 23, 1968, and approval for it was given on April 24th. Appellant was notified on May 6, 1968, of its termination as broker for Chicken of the Sea tuna, but was asked to continue as broker through July 31, 1968.</p>\n<p id=\"b1144-4\">From at least 1968 until the time appellant ceased representing appellee, appellant was aware of the fact that appellee might consider returning to direct sales in northern California. When the termination decision was made, appellant was offered two months equivalent brokerage.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The offer of equivalent brokerage was extended to retain the good will of appellant during the change-over period and to provide payment to appellant during the transition. On May 28, 1968, appellant notified appellee that it was ceasing to represent appellee as of June 30, 1968. On July 1, 1968, appellant began representing Carnation, a competitive brand of tuna. Appellant received brokerage through June 30th.</p>\n<p id=\"b1144-11\">PLEADINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b1144-12\">On December 24, 1968, appellant filed a complaint charging breach of contract, bad faith and violations of the antitrust laws previously noted. Ralston answered and counter-claimed for brokerage paid by mistake. No jury was requested by either party. On September 8, 1969, appellant moved for a jury trial. The motion was denied as untimely. Then appellant filed a motion for leave to amend the complaint, stating two additional causes of action. The amended complaint was filed, and appellant then filed a demand for a jury trial on its two additional causes. A motion to strike the jury demand was granted. Subsequently, the court denied appellant\u2019s motion to reconsider the demand for a jury trial, and the case proceeded to trial before the court. After trial, the court rendered its memorandum of decision against appellant and in favor of appellee. The court later signed and filed detailed findings of fact and conclusions of law on which judgment was entered against appellant on its claims and in favor of appellee on its counterclaim for $1,558.78.</p>\n<p id=\"b1144-13\">CONTENTIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b1144-14\">Briefly stated, appellant\u2019s contentions are:</p>\n<p id=\"b1144-15\">(I) that it was entitled to a jury trial on its sixth and seventh claims; <footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1144-16\">(II) that appellee\u2019s conduct constituted an unreasonable restraint of trade which proximately caused damage to appellant in violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act;</p>\n<p id=\"b1144-17\">(III) that the trial court applied an erroneous rule of law in requiring direct evidence of intent to monopolize on a claim of attempted monopoly under Section 2 of the Sherman Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1145-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1049\">*1049</page-number>JURY REQUEST</p>\n<p id=\"b1145-5\">Appellant concedes that it failed to file a timely motion for a jury trial on its first five claims. It asserts, however, that a timely demand was made for a jury trial on the issues created by the sixth and seventh claims set forth in the amended complaint. The answer lies in whether the sixth and seventh claims created new <em>issues </em>within the meaning of Rule 38(b), F.R.Civ.P.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> [Emphasis supplied.]</p>\n<p id=\"b1145-6\">In addition to incorporating by reference all of the allegations in the previous four claims charging Sherman Act violations, the fifth claim of appellant\u2019s original complaint \u2014 on which appellant failed to ask for a jury trial \u2014 alleged that in May, 1968, the appellee and another surreptitiously attempted to induce salesmen and other employees of appellant to breach and terminate their employment contracts with appellant and to accept employment with appellee. The claim then went on to charge that this conduct and \u201c . . . <em>the termination of Trixler\u2019s brokerage agreements, . </em>were performed [by appellee] <em>in bad faith and in violation of </em>[appel-lee\u2019s] <em>obligation to act in good faith and to deal fairly with . . </em>. \u201d appellant. [Emphasis supplied.]</p>\n<p id=\"b1145-10\">The appellee, not surprisingly, sought additional information with reference to the charges of bad faith and unfair dealings set forth in the fifth claim. On discovery, in answer to an interrogatory as to the facts on which it based its bad faith charges in that claim, the appellant\u2019s response was vague and indefinite. Being dissatisfied with this response, appellee sought additional details on the nature of the bad faith charges. In answer to this request for clarification, the appellant expanded on its previous statement of the bad faith charges in the fifth claim and stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1145-12\">\u201cOver a period of several years, commencing in or about 1965 and continuing through April 1968, Ralston Purina represented to Trixler' that there was no possibility in the foreseeable future of Ralston Purina substituting a direct sales force for brokers in Northern California, or in any area other than in St. Louis (in April 1965) and in Los Angeles (in August 1966) , and that such a substitution was not the subject of consideration or study by Ralston Purina. Said representations were made by Ralston Purina to Trixler on at least the following occasions, by and to the following named individuals:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1145-15\">(a) In or about August 1965, R. H. Dean so represented to J. Thomas Trixler;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1145-16\">(b) In or about January 1966, R. H. Dean so represented to J. Thomas Trixler;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1145-17\">(c) In or about May 1966, Glenn Copeland so represented to J. Thomas Trixler;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1145-18\">(d) In or about November 1967, R. L. Siler, Guy Dougherty and Bob McMath so represented to J. Thomas Trixler and John T. O\u2019Leary.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1145-19\">It will be observed that each allegation in the supplemental response amounts to a charge of bad faith and a violation of \u201cappellee\u2019s obligation to act in good faith and to deal fairly with\u201d the appellant, as alleged in the fifth claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1145-20\">Particularly significant is the fact that appellant\u2019s alleged sixth and seventh claims use substantially the same language employed by appellant in its supplemental response to appellee\u2019s inquiry into the basis of the bad faith charges in the fifth claim. Clearly, the allegations of bad faith in the fifth claim are sufficiently broad to permit evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1050\">*1050</page-number>of the acts charged in the sixth and seventh <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b1146-4\">Although designated as the sixth and seventh causes of action, they are in fact neither causes of action nor claims. At most, they clarify the charges already made in the fifth claim. The sixth and seventh claims, by elaborating on the charges of bad faith in the fifth claim, did not create new <em>issues. </em>By any reasonable analysis, the identical issue of bad faith is charged in each one of the claims. We need not further clutter the legal publications by citing authority to support the statement that pleadings under F.R.Civ.P. are to be liberally construed. In these circumstances, having waived its right to a jury trial on its fifth claim, the appellant is not entitled to a jury trial on a more detailed statement of the same charge in the sixth and seventh claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b1146-5\">Cataldo v. E. I. DuPont De Nemours &amp; Co., 253 F.Supp. 235 (S.D.N.Y.1966), upon which appellant relies, would be a fragile foundation on which to rest our decision. First of all, the case is not binding on us. Next, we question if in the circumstances of this case appellant\u2019s sixth and seventh claims introduced new <em>theories </em>of recovery. Bad faith is the underlying theory of all. Finally, we hold that the presentation of a new <em>theory </em>does not constitute the presentation of a new <em>issue </em>on which a jury trial should be granted under F.R.Civ.P., Rule 38(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b1146-6\">Manifestly, the <em>issue </em>contemplated by the Rule is one of fact. When read in context, the word <em>issue </em>must have been intended by the Supreme Court to mean nothing other than an issue of fact. Obviously, appellant would not be demanding a jury trial on an issue of law. A <em>theory </em>of recovery, as distinguished from an issue of fact, in normal parlance presents a question of law. Even a casual reading of the applicable subdivision of the Rule makes it clear that the <em>issue </em>on which demand may be made for a jury trial is not created until service of the \u201clast pleading directed to such <em>issue.\u201d </em>The <em>theory </em>of a case relates to the ultimate basis of liability, rather than to an <em>issue </em>created by the pleadings. An <em>issue </em>of fact does not exist unless there is an allegation and a responsive denial. A <em>theory </em>of recovery exists from the outset, irrespective of a responsive pleading. A word, such as <em>issue, </em>with a fixed legal meaning is presumed to have been used in that sense. Bradley v. United States, 410 U.S. 605, 609, 93 S.Ct. 1151, 35 L.Ed.2d 528 (1973); Barber v. Gonzales, 347 U.S. 637, 74 S.Ct. 822, 98 L.Ed. 1009 (1954). Moreover, the use of the word <em>issue, </em>in these circumstances, would imply the exclusion of the word <em>theory. </em>Matheson v. Armbrust, 365 U.S. 870, 81 S.Ct. 904, 5 L.Ed.2d 860 (1961); Arley v. United Pacific Ins. Co., 379 F.2d 183 (CA9 1967), cert. denied, 390 U.S. 950, 88 S.Ct. 1039, 19 L.Ed.2d 1140 (1968). We decline to follow <em>Cataldo.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1146-8\">Much more in point, although factually distinguishable, are Alcoa S. S. Co. v. Ryan, 211 F.2d 576 (CA2 1954); Railex Corp. v. Joseph Guss &amp; Sons, Inc., 40 F.R.D. 119 (D.D.C.1966), aff\u2019d, 127 U.S. App.D.C. 230, 382 F.2d 179 (1967), and Reeves v. Pennsylvania R. Co., 9 F.R.D. 487 (D.Del.1949). All of the evidence which might be introduced under the specific allegations set forth in claims six and seven was, in fact, received by the trial court under the allegations of the fifth claim. Specific findings against appellant were made on all of these charges. In finding against appellant on its allegations in the fifth claim, the lower court necessarily disposed of appellant\u2019s contentions as set forth in its alleged sixth and seventh claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b1146-9\">RESTRAINT OF TRADE</p>\n<p id=\"b1146-10\">Despite appellant\u2019s forceful arguments to the contrary, we agree with the district court\u2019s findings that appellee did not violate Section 1 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1, and thus hold that they are not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b1146-11\">Under the doctrine stated in Bushie v. Stenocord Corp., 460 F.2d 116 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1051\">*1051</page-number>(CA9 1972), appellee was entitled to terminate appellant\u2019s brokerage services provided that valid business reasons underscored the termination and that there was no parallel arrangement for restraining trade. Appellant concedes that a manufacturer may normally control the distribution of its own products, choose its customers as it sees fit, and cease doing business with a particular distributor at any time. United States v. General Motors Corp., 384 U.S. 127, 86 S.Ct. 1321, 16 L.Ed.2d 415 (1966); United States v. Parke, Davis &amp; Co., 362 U.S. 29, 80 S.Ct. 503, 4 L.Ed.2d 505 (1960), and Joseph E. Seagram &amp; Sons, Inc. v. Hawaiian Oke &amp; Liquors, Ltd., 416 F.2d 71 (CA9 1969), cert. denied, 396 U.S. 1062, 90 S.Ct. 752, 24 L.Ed.2d 755 (1970), rehearing denied, 397 U.S. 1003, 90 S.Ct. 1113, 25 L.Ed.2d 415. Appellant also concedes that the district court properly held that the standard for determining whether an arrangement violates Section 1 of the Sherman Act is whether it is so inherently anti-competitive in purpose or effect, or both, as to constitute an unreasonable restraint of trade. At this point, however, the appellant parts company with the lower court and argues that it committed reversible error by holding that the \u201cnon-compete\u201d provision was reasonable in scope and duration and served a legitimate business purpose not in restraint of trade. Our examination of the record convinces us that the trial court did not erroneously apply the standards mentioned in Alpha Distributing Co. of Cal., Inc. v. Jack Daniel Distillery, 454 F.2d 442, 452 (CA9 1972), and that there is ample evidence in support of its finding that the \u201cnon-compete\u201d provision was reasonable in scope and duration and served a legitimate business purpose not in restraint of trade.</p>\n<p id=\"b1147-5\">Appellant\u2019s contention that there was an oral brokerage contract between appellant and appellee to last as long as appellant ably performed its responsibility, and that appellee breached that contract, presents a question of fact. Appellant is here faced with the adverse finding of the trial court that no such oral contract existed and that there was no fixed term of duration, either explicit or implicit, or that appellant would continue to have appellee\u2019s account as long as appellant \u201ccontinue to do a good job.\u201d These findings are not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b1147-7\">Nor do we find substance in appellant\u2019s claim that appellee\u2019s qualified offer of 60 days\u2019 \u201cequivalent\u201d brokerage constituted an unreasonable restraint of trade. Again, on this issue, the lower court made specific findings against the appellant and, additionally found that appellant was not \u201cotherwise entitled\u201d to equivalent brokerage. These findings are supported by the record and are controlling on the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b1147-8\">ATTEMPTED MONOPOLIZATION</p>\n<p id=\"b1147-9\">Finally, appellant urges that the trial court applied an erroneous rule of law in requiring direct evidence of intent to monopolize on a claim of attempted monopolization under Section 2 of the Sherman Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1147-10\">At the outset, we must recognize that a manufacturer, such as appellee, has a natural monopoly over its own products, especially when the products are sold under trademark. Industrial Bldg. Materials, Inc. v. Interchemical Corp., 437 F.2d 1336, 1344 (CA9 1970). Under such circumstances, there is no violation of the antitrust laws unless the manufacturer uses his natural monopoly to gain control of the relevant market in which his products compete.</p>\n<p id=\"b1147-11\">Appellant\u2019s argument that the establishment of his claim in restraint of trade under Section 1, creates a <em>prima facie </em>case of attempting to monopolize under Section 2, falls of its own weight. Since we have already held against appellant on its Section 1 claim, that claim cannot be used to create a <em>prima facie </em>case for a Section 2 claim of attempting to monopolize.</p>\n<p id=\"b1147-12\">Utilizing language in Lessig v. Tidewater Oil Co., 327 F.2d 459, 474 (CA9 1964), cert. denied, 377 U.S. 993, 84 S.Ct. 1920, 12 L.Ed.2d 1046, and Industrial Bldg. Materials, Inc. v. Interchemical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1052\">*1052</page-number>Corp., <em>supra, </em>appellant argues that the lower court was in error when it held that appellee had no intent to monopolize the tuna business and did not attempt to monopolize it. In each of those cases, the attempt to monopolize claim was founded upon a substantial claim of restraint of trade, and in those circumstances we held that the specific intent required for a claim of attempting to monopolize could be inferred. Since appellant failed on its restraint of trade claim, no basis for the inference ever existed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1148-4\">Appellant challenges the lower court\u2019s conclusion that: \u201cTo prove a violation of section 2 of the Sherman Act, the plaintiff must show a specific intent to monopolize <em>and sufficient market power to establish a \u2018dangerous probability\u2019 of success.\u201d </em>[Emphasis Supplied.] Even conceding that the relevant market is not in issue where the charge is attempt to monopolize, rather than monopolization, <em>Industrial Bldg. Materials, Inc., supra, </em>437 F.2d at 1344, nonetheless, the district court\u2019s finding that appellee had no intent to monopolize the tuna business and did not make such an attempt, is controlling. The conclusion of the court on appellant\u2019s burden with reference to the relevant market is surplus-age and in no way prejudiced the appellant. The court\u2019s finding of a lack of intent<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> is sufficient, in itself, to destroy appellant\u2019s attempted monopolization claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1148-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1148-6\">Without going into further detail, we hold the there is ample evidence to support the findings of fact of the lower court, that the court correctly applied the law to the facts before it, and that none of its findings is clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b1148-9\">We have not discussed in detail each of appellant\u2019s contentions. However, we have considered them and feel that a more detailed discussion would unduly lengthen this opinion, without enlightenment to the bench or bar, and without change in the ultimate result.</p>\n<p id=\"b1148-10\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1144-5\">. Equivalent brokerage is the sum computed by applying the broker\u2019s commission to sales actually made in the period for which bro- . kerage is being paid, even though the sales are made by another broker or a direct sales force.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1144-18\">.

Ralston Purina had no intent to monopolize the tuna business here involved and did not attempt to monopolize that business. The limitation in its offer was reasonable in time and scope.

There was no shortage of brokers to handle the products of Ralston Purina\u2019s competitors\u201d (R.Vol. 6,1390).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b1148-11\">MERRILL, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"A5y\">(concurring) :</p>\n<p id=\"b1148-12\">I concur in Judge Kilkenny\u2019s opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1148-13\">In addition to the facts recited by him I would note that the offer of equivalent brokerage was conditioned upon appellant not representing products which ap-pellee considered \u201ccompetitive\u201d with its tuna products; that the offer further provided that appellant would be free to begin representing competitive brands at any time and would nevertheless be entitled to receive equivalent brokerage for such time during the two-month period as it did not represent competitive brands.</p>\n<p id=\"b1148-14\">I understand Judge Kilkenny to hold that the basic issue here presented under \u00a7 1 of the Sherman Act is whether, in light of the e'ourse of dealing between the parties, this offer of equivalent brokerage conditioned on this covenant not to compete was, as matter of law, reasonable or unreasonable. On this I agree with Judge Kilkenny that as matter of law it was reasonable.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
