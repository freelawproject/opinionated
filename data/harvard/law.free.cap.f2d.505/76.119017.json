Citizens Casualty Co. of New York et al., 5 Cir., 1970, 431 F.2d 409, Part I.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b173-7\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b173-8\">Lundy stands convicted of buying food stamps face-valued at $100.00 or more for cash, in violation of 7 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2023(b). The only issue which warrants discussion on his appeal from that conviction is whether the District Court erred in permitting the jury to consider the felony charge.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We hold it did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-9\">Mrs. Dawson, a Government \u201cinvestigative aide\u201d testified she received $115.-00 (face value) in food stamps from Mr. Rowe, a full time Special Agent for the Department of Agriculture. Mr. Rowe directly corroborated this much of her testimony. On direct examination, Mrs. Dawson positively testified she sold all those stamps to the defendant. On cross-examination, however, Mrs. Dawson\u2019s recollection of the incident was less clear. To refresh her memory, she used a memorandum on which she had written the serial numbers of the books she was taking into Lundy\u2019s store.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-10\">First, she testified her books were in 10 and 30 dollar denominations.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Second, her memo contained three entries. From this the defense deduced the maximum value Mrs. Dawson could have taken into the store was $70.00 (2-$30\u2019s and 1-$10). When questioned by counsel, she conceded that must have been so. Tr. at 33. The Government asked no questions in rebuttal \u2014 indeed, it does not discuss this point in its appellate brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-12\">Nevertheless, we think the dollar-amount question was fully and properly presented to the jury. By choosing among alternative special verdicts \u2014 a procedure we approved in a similar case, United States v. Devall, 5 Cir., 1972, 462 F.2d 137 \u2014 they specifically found the defendant bought stamps face valued at $100.00 or more.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-13\">We hold the jury could so have found beyond a reasonable doubt. Each book of stamps was marked with a serial number, which number was borne by ,,each stamp in the book. Mr. Rowe testified to the serial numbers of the food stamp coupons.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The jury could reasonably conclude that Mrs. Dawson\u2019s list may have merely combined the serial numbers of books (1) and (2) and books (3) and (4), separating them only at the end where the digits diverge.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b173-14\">Whether or not we would hold this proof of value beyond a reasonable doubt had this been her testimony on direct is not the question. The question is whether this explanation, together with the other positive testimony that all five books were sold to Lundy, is \u2014 as a matter of law \u2014 enough to serve as a basis for the jury\u2019s verdict. Drawing those inferences most favorable to the Government from this evidence, and if the jury believed Mrs. Dawson\u2019s direct testimony, they could reasonably have concluded Lundy was guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-15\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b173-16\">.
