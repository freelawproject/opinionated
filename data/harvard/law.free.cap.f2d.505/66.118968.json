The plaintiffs contend that the company defendant\u2019s past discrimination in the hiring of road drivers has been perpetuated by the company\u2019s no-transfer policy and by the maintenance of separate seniority rosters for road and city drivers without provision for seniority carryover by the defendant unions. As a result of these policies, the plaintiffs argue, they have been discriminatorily \u201clocked in\u201d their city driver jobs without any realistic opportunity to transfer to a higher paying road job position. The district court found no discrimination. On the authority of Rodriguez v. East Texas Motor Freight, 5 Cir. 1974, 505 F.2d 40, decided today, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-20\">In almost every respect this suit is a carbon copy of <em>Rodriguez, </em>except that <em>Rodriguez </em>was a class action while this is brought only on behalf of the individual plaintiffs. The plaintiffs here work as city drivers in Yellow Freight\u2019s San <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>Antonio terminal. Like East Texas Motor Freight, Yellow Freight domiciles no road drivers in San Antonio. Like East Texas Motor Freight, Yellow Freight\u2019s history of road-driver hiring is heavily tainted by discriminatory exclusion of minority drivers.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> And like East Texas Motor Freight, Yellow Freight, and the unions, have hindered the transfer of city drivers to road driver jobs by a no-transfer policy and the maintenance of separate seniority rosters. This case was brought before the same district judge that heard <em>Rodriguez </em>a few days later. Similar to its finding in <em>Rodriguez, </em>the court found that none of the plaintiffs \u201ccould satisfy all the qualifications for a road driver position according to the company manual due to age or weight or driving record\u201d. The court concluded that \u201c[t]he defendants did not discriminate against the plaintiffs or any other employee or Union member on the basis of race or otherwise\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-4\"> The defendants here advance many of the same arguments in support of the district court\u2019s conclusion that the defendants advanced in <em>Rodriguez, </em>and again we reject them. It is our considered view that the plaintiffs established a prima facie case of hiring discrimination perpetuated by the racially neutral no-transfer and no-seniority-carryover policies of Yellow Freight, Local 657, and the Southern Conference.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The discriminatory effect of these policies was not justified by a showing of business necessity. The district court\u2019s finding of no discrimination, therefore, is erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">Because this is not a class action, we pause to amplify our discussion in <em>Rodriguez </em>of McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 1973, 411 U.S. 792, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668. In <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>the Court outlined the following test for a complainant in a Title VII action:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-10\">The complainant in a Title VII trial must carry the initial burden under the statute of establishing a prima fa-cie case of racial discrimination. This may be done by showing (i) that he belongs to a racial minority; (ii) that he applied and was qualified for a job for which the employer was seeking applicants; (iii) that, despite his qualifications, he was rejected; and (iv) that, after his rejection, the position remained open and the employer continued to seek applicants from persons of complainant\u2019s qualifications.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AP8\">411 U.S. at 802, 93 S.Ct. at 1824. The defendants argue here that <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>must control. In <em>Rodriguez </em>we distinguished <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>on three grounds. Rodriguez was a class action; there was a history of hiring discrimination sufficient to make application for a road driving job a futile exercise; and the plaintiffs had been denied the opportunity to show that they were qualified to become road drivers, because they had not been given a road test. Although the instant case is not a class action, we are of the view that McDonnell Douglas is distinguishable on the other two grounds. Here there is a history of past hiring discrimination, and, as in <em>Rodriguez, </em>the plaintiffs had no opportunity to take a road test and thus to prove their qualifications.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b164-11\">We reverse and remand to the district court for consideration of the remedy question in light of <em>Rodriguez.</em></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b164-6\">. Yellow Freight responded to the plaintiffs\u2019 interrogatories by stating that it employed 50 line drivers at. Dallas and 40 line drivers at Amarillo. Yellow Freight employed no Mexican-American line drivers at either terminal until after the complaint was filed in this suit.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b164-7\">. Because the separate seniority lists originate at the Southern Conference level, we find no violation of Title VII by the defendant Teamsters International.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b164-13\">. Jim Xorman, road operations manager for Yellow Freight, at its Baxter Springs, Kansas, terminal, testified that he would consider a line driver qualified only after personally testing t.he driver in the equipment and checking his knowledge of safety requirements.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
