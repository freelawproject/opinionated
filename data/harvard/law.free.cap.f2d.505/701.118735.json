Petitioner concedes that its failure to shore, sheet, brace, slope, or otherwise support a trench of a depth greater than five feet, which permitted the collapse of the trench and the death of an employee, constituted a \u201cserious\u201d violation of the OSHA,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> but challenges the conclusion of the OSHRC that such failure was \u201cwillful\u201d under section 17(a) of the Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 666(a).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b798-4\">The Commission\u2019s conclusion of willfulness was fully warranted. Petitioner was obviously aware of the shoring requirements applicable in cases of trenches exceeding five feet in depth, having been convicted of a previous violation within a year. In the present case its foreman, Wilfred Bisson, himself measured the depth of the trench the afternoon before the accident, recording a distance of <em>\u00e1]/2 </em>feet from the ground surface to the top of a transite water main just uncovered. At that point Bisson knew that \u201cwe had quite a distance to go to reach the depth that we needed. . . . [W]e would have to clear . . . off [the pipe] and start digging in . . . \u201d The following morning Bisson began that operation, instructing James DeMenezes to dig around and beneath the water main, which of necessity would result in passing the five foot mark. Yet, knowing this, and that the men were already beginning to dig, he left without giving any instructions as to shoring. The Commission could properly conclude that Bisson did not expect, under these circumstances, that the men would install the shoring the moment five feet was reached, even though, in the past, there had been general instructions. Bisson neither ordered shoring nor returned to the trench until the shouts of his men informed him that DeMenezes had been buried beneath the mud. Such indifference to the requirements of law may alone represent a willful statutory violation <em>see </em>United States v. Illinois Central R. R., 1938, 303 U.S. 239, 243, 58 S.Ct. 533, 82 L.Ed. 773, and is not met by Bis-son\u2019s private determination that in this case it would not be dangerous. The regulation unambiguously forecloses such discretion. In addition, we believe the Commission was justified in taking Bis-son\u2019s testimony to mean that he had consciously decided not to shore the trench at that time because it would have been difficult, although not impossible, to do in the presence of the transite pipe; again, a factor precluded under the regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-13\">Petitioner, through its foreman, made its choice, a conscious, intentional, deliberate, voluntary decision, which, regardless of a venial motive, properly is described as willful.
