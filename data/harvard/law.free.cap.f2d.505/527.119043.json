In their treble damage complaint, plaintiffs alleged that they had authorized the defendant savings and loans and other agents<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (hereinafter Taiman) to purchase title insurance<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> for them. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>Taiman obtained policies solely from defendants Chicago Title &amp; Trust Co. and Chicago Title Insurance Co. (hereinafter CT&amp;T); without plaintiffs\u2019 knowledge, Taiman received from CT&amp;T a payment equal to 10,% of the amount paid as premiums by plaintiffs. The district court dismissed \u2022 the complaint on the ground that \u00a7 2(c) has no applicability to payments made in connection with the sale of intangibles such as insurance. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">The dispute in this case centers largely around the proper reading of \u00a7 2(c) of the Clayton Act. The statute provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-7\">\u201c(c) Payment or acceptance of commission, brokerage or other compensation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-8\">It shall be unlawful for any person engaged in commerce, in the course of such commerce, to pay or grant, or to receive or accept, anything of value as a commission, brokerage, or other compensation, or any allowance or discount in lieu thereof, <em>except for services rendered in connection with the sale or purchase of goods, wares, or merchandise, </em>either to the other party to such transaction or <em>to </em>an agent, representative, or other intermediary therein where such intermediary is acting in fact for or in behalf, or is subject to the direct or indirect control, of any party to such transaction other than the person by whom such compensation is so granted or paid.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b625-15\">Plaintiffs note that there is no comma between the words \u201crendered\u201d and \u201cin.\u201d Thus, they contend that the statute expressly prohibits commissions paid to the other party or his agent in any transaction in commerce, without limitation to transactions involving tangibles, and that the statutory reference to \u201cin connection with the sale or purchase of goods, wares or merchandise . . . \u201d limits the exception of \u201cservices rendered\u201d and is not a limitation of the broad prohibition itself. The district court, however, read the statute as if a comma had been inserted between the two words. Under its reading \u00a7 2(c) has applicability only if \u201cgoods, wares, or merchandise.\u201d <em>i. e., </em>tangibles,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> are involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-17\">Section 2(c) was enacted as part of the Robinson-Patman Amendments to the Clayton Act. <em>See </em>Act of June 19, 1936, Pub.L.No. 74-692, \u00a7 2(c), 49 Stat. 1527. The courts have consistently interpreted the other provisions of the Robinson-Patman Act as being restricted to transactions involving tangible products.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In Baum v. Investors Diversified Services, Inc., 409 F.2d 872, 875 (7th Cir. 1969), for example, this court held that \u00a7 2(a) of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 13(a), was so restricted. As one scholar has observed, the result reached in these decisions \u201ccomports with the Act\u2019s legislative history and textual structure.\u201d F. Rowe, Price Discrimination Under the Robinson-Patman Act 61 (1962). Since we find no affirmative evidence that Congress intended \u00a7 2(c) to be the only Robinson-Patman provision applicable to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>intangibles,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> we are satisfied that the district court\u2019s interpretation of this section is the proper one.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b626-4\">Plaintiffs argue that this interpretation in effect requires judicial repunctu-ation of \u00a7 2(c) and that such is improper. The Supreme Court, however, has stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Axu\">\u201cPunctuation marks are no part of an act. To determine the intent of the law, the court, in construing a statute, will disregard the punctuation, or will repunctuate, if that be necessary, in order to arrive at the natural meaning of the words employed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">United States v. Shreveport Grain &amp; Elevator Co., 287 U.S. 77, 82-83, 53 S.Ct. 42, 44, 77 L.Ed. 175 (citing cases). In our opinion, it is appropriate to read \u00a7 2(c) as though it contained one more comma in order to effectuate apparent congressional intent.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b626-13\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-14\">Insofar as title insurance bears the same qualities as any other insurance, it can properly be characterized as an intangible not subject to \u00a7 2(c).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> According to plaintiffs, however, the purchaser of a CT&amp;T policy is not as interested in insurance as he is in the report on the presence or absence of title defects which accompanies every policy; the \u201cinsurance aspect simply indemnifies the \u2018insured\u2019 against loss should the report as to the status of the title prove inaccurate.\u201d Pl.Br. at 41. Plaintiffs thus contend that, even if \u00a7 2(c) is limited to tangibles, it prohibits the alleged rebates because the report itself is a tangible physical document.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-15\">Assuming <em>arguendo </em>that plaintiffs\u2019 determination of the principal purpose of title insurance is correct,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>must nevertheless reject their contention. The transfer of any intangible can rarely be accomplished without the \u201cincidental involvement\u201d of documents or other tangibles; consequently, it is the \u201cdominant nature\u201d of such transactions which determines whether they are subject to \u00a7 2(c).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">CT&amp;T does provide purchasers of title insurance with a tangible, physical document. More importantly, however, it provides them with a professional service, namely, the search of records which might reveal a defect in the title and the rendering of an opinion based upon this search; the reports, like legal memo-randa, are merely the embodiment of that service. Clearly, it is the performance of this service and not the delivery of a physical document which constitutes the dominant nature of the transaction between CT&amp;T and its customers. <em>Compare Tri-State Broadcasting, supra </em>note 10. Since services are intangible, see <em>Baum, supra </em>note 3, at 875, even plaintiffs\u2019 characterization of title insurance\u2019s principal purpose is insufficient to invoke \u00a7 2(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-7\">Section 2(b) of the McCarranFerguson Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1012(b), contains the following proviso:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-8\">\u201c[AJfter June 30, 1948 . . . the Act of October 15, 1914, as amended, known as the Clayton Act . shall be applicable to the business of insurance to the extent that such business is not regulated by State law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ajv-dedup-0\">Plaintiffs contend that \u00a7 2(b) is a substantive amendment to the Clayton Act which makes each of the provisions of this Act, including \u00a7 2(c), applicable to the insurance industry \u2014 regardless of whether the provision applies according to its terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-17\">The legislative history of the McCar-ran-Ferguson Act demonstrates that Congress intended no such amendment. In 1868 the Supreme Court determined that the business of insurance was a matter of purely state concern. <em>See </em>Paul v. Virginia, 75 U.S. (8 Wall.) 168, 19 L.Ed. 357. Some 75 years later, however, in United States v. South-Eastern Underwriters Ass\u2019n, 322 U.S. 533, 64 S.Ct. 1162, 88 L.Ed. 1440 the Court reversed itself; it held that the insurance business was commerce and, therefore, subject to the federal antitrust laws. As a result of this ruling, there arose great uncertainty over the constitutionality of state statutes regulating insurance. The McCarran Act was passed in response to this uncertainty.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b627-18\">Congress\u2019 intent was to make certain \u25a0that the states\u2019 power to regulate insurance should continue. This is apparent not only in the debates and legislative material accompanying the Act\u2019s pas<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>sage,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> but in the language of the Act itself.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> As Justice Rutledge, speaking for the Court in Prudential Insurance Co. v. Benjamin, 328 U.S. 408, 66 S.Ct. 1142, 90 L.Ed. 1342 noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-4\">\u201cObviously Congress\u2019 purpose was broadly to give support to the existing and future state systems for regulating and taxing the business of insurance. This was done in two ways. One was by removing obstructions which might be thought to flow from its own power, whether dormant or exercised, except as otherwise expressly provided in the Act itself or in future legislation. The other was by declaring expressly and affirmatively that continued state regulation and taxation of this business is in the public interest and that the business and all who engage in it \u2018shall be subject to\u2019 the laws of the several states in these respects.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b628-15\">328 U.S. at 429-430, 66 S.Ct. at 1155 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b628-16\">While Congress\u2019 concern with ensuring the states\u2019 power is clear from the Act\u2019s legislative history, there is nothing in that history indicating any intent to expand federal power. The legislators correctly recognized that the Supreme Court, in <em>South-Eastern, </em>broadened the coverage of the federal antitrust laws. Thus, they were concerned only with making certain that, insofar as these laws already were applicable as a result of the <em>South-Eastern </em>decision, they should not be construed as invalidating or displacing state laws.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b629-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>Plaintiffs note that, when the Senate initially passed what is now the McCar-ran-Ferguson Act, it provided in part that nothing in the Robinson-Patman Act \u201cshall apply to the business of insurance or to acts in the conduct of that business.\u201d <em>See </em>91 Cong.Rec. 488 (1945). The ultimate rejection of this provision is, according to plaintiffs, persuasive evidence of Congress\u2019 intent to make the Robinson-Patman Act, and therefore \u00a7 2(c), applicable to insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">Congress\u2019 action does not, in our opinion, admit of that interpretation. Indeed, it is likely that some legislators withdrew support for the provision because they recognized that it was unnecessary since insurance was not covered by the Robinson-Patman Act;<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> others, erroneously believing that insurance was covered, were unwilling to change the Act so as to exempt the insurance industry.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> There is, however, nothing in the legislative history to suggest that any legislator thought he was broadening the coverage of the Robinson-Patman Act by rejecting an amendment which would expressly exempt the insurance industry from its coverage. The net result of the elimination of the provision was merely to permit the impact of the Robinson-Patman Act on the insurance industry to be unaffected, one way or another, by the enactment of the McCarran-Ferguson Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-14\">Before a court will find that Congress has amended a statute, there must be clear evidence of an intent to do so. <em>See </em>United States v. Welden, 377 U.S. 95, 84 S.Ct. 1082, 1087, 12 L.Ed.2d 152, 103 n. 12 (\u201cAmendments by implication . . . are not favored\u201d). In this case, there is nothing in the language or legislative history<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> of the McCarran-Ferguson Act which indicates that Congress intended to enlarge the scope of the Clayton Act; and, since the clear purpose of the Act was to protect the states\u2019 power of regulating insurance, such an intent can hardly be presumed. Consequently, plaintiffs\u2019 construction of \u00a7 2(b) is untenable.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b630-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-4\">Plaintiffs\u2019 final contention, that CT&amp;T .is collaterally estopped by the judgment in United States v. Chicago Title &amp; Trust Co., 242 F.Supp. 56 (N.D.Ill.1965), from denying that \u00a7 2(c) applies to title insurance, also is without merit. In <em>Chicago Title </em>the court determined only that \u00a7 7 of the Clayton Act applies to the title insurance business. Since the prohibition of \u00a7 7, unlike that of \u00a7 2(c), is not limited to \u201cgoods, wares, or merchandise,\u201d the <em>Chicago Title </em>decision cannot have the estoppel effect for which plaintiffs contend.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">In conclusion, it should be noted that our decision in this appeal is simply that \u00a7 2(c) of the Clayton Act, as amended by the Robinson-Patman Act, has no applicability where the \u201cproduct\u201d involved is title insurance. We, of course, express no opinion on the propriety of the rebate practices described in the complaint and, specifically, on whether such practices might be prohibited by other state or federal laws.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">The judgment of the district court dismissing plaintiffs\u2019 complaint for failure to state a cause of action is</p>\n<p id=\"b630-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b624-16\">.

It might be noted that, under plaintiffs\u2019 interpretation, \u00a7 2(c) would apparently prohibit the payment of a commission in connection with the purchase or sale of intangibles even if \u201cservices\u201d had been rendered.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b626-7\">.

Senator O\u2019Mahoney, who had drafted a bill similar to the McCarran Act and served as a manager of the Senate in connection with this Act, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-22\">\u201cIn drafting those two bills we sought to spell out each particular law which <em>might apply </em>to insurance. ...

Representative Gwynne stated that this provision</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AHF\">\u201cis not necessary in the bill, but it was inserted, I suppose, to make it clear that the Federal Trade Commission Act should not apply to insurance and that the Robinson-Patman Act should not apply to insurance. The reason is this: The Robinson-Patman</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-9\">Act was passed with the intent that it should regulate and control the sale of commodities. It was not meant to cover insurance any more than it was meant to cover the banking business. If the Members wish a bill of the character of the Robinson-Patman Act to cover insurance, then I submit a special bill should be introduced which should cover it more equitably and more accurately than the Robinson-Patman Act, which was not written with insurance in mind.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b629-10\">91 Cong.Rec. 1090 (1945).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b629-11\">.

Plaintiffs argue that \u00a7 2(b) is clear on its face and, therefore, there is no need to resort to legislative history. This contention was effectively answered by the Supreme Court in Harrison v. Northern Trust Co., 317 U.S. 476, 479, 63 S.Ct. 361, 363, 87 L.Ed. 407:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-20\">\u201cBut words are inexact tools at best, and for that reason there is wisely no rule of law forbidding resort to explanatory legislative history no matter how \u2018clear the words may appear on \u201csuperficial examination.\u201d \u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A5m\">Moreover, \u00a7 2(b) must be considered in light of the other provisions of the McCarran Act. See authority cited in 2A Sutherland, Statutory Construction \u00a7 46.05 (4th ed. C. Sands ed. 1973). Given the congressional purpose apparent in these provisions, the language in \u00a7 2(b) is by no means as clear as plaintiffs suggest.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b629-21\">. That Congress intended the Clayton Act to apply only to the extent that it applied prior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>to the <em>South-Eastern </em>decision is apparent from the remarks of several congressmen. Senator McCarran, for example, stated with reference to \u00a7 2(b) :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-12\">\u201cUnder the provisions of the section in the conference report to which the Senator addresses himself, the States are advised and warned that they have a moratorium of 3 years during which they may bring themselves into compliance by way of regulation. If at the end of the 3 years they have not brought themselves into compliance, if they have not regulated the business of insurance, then they must take the consequences because after that period is over the Sherman Act and the Clayton Act and the other acts become immediately <em>again </em>in force as regards the business of insurance.
