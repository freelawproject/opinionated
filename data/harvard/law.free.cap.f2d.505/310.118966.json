The Board, in an earlier proceeding conducted pursuant to section 10 (k) of the Act, issued an affirmative award of the disputed work to the Company\u2019s employees represented by Laborers\u2019 International Union of North America, Local Union No. 343, AFL-CIO and Local Union No. 835, International Union of Operating Engineers, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>AFL-CIO and determined that employees represented by Dock Builders were not entitled to perform the disputed work.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">This decision is not contested on the merits. The contention raised by the Dock Builders on this petition to review is that there was no jurisdictional dispute and that even if there had been a violation the scope of the award should have been limited.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">The underlying facts are presented in some length in the decision of the Administrative Law Judge, adopted by the Board, and we do not think it necessary to restate them.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-7\">While the issues presented by petitioner are framed in alternative ways, what seems to us to be the salient contention of the Dock Builders is that the Board\u2019s order should not be sustained because the Dock Builders were merely attempting to claim work that it had become contractually entitled to in the past, and it had only become the subject of dispute because of the company\u2019s attempt to create conflicting claims by offering the work to another union (the Laborers), which had not claimed it but was willing to accept the employer\u2019s assignment. The difficulty is the Board\u2019s finding that the record contains no evidence of the contract that is the key ingredient of the Dock Builders\u2019 contention. After the hearing held in June, 1972, in the 10 (k) proceeding, the Dock Builders presented to the Board a letter moving for a re-opening of the 10(k) record. That motion was opposed by the Company. The Board denied the motion on the ground that the union had failed to set forth facts establishing that the evidence was previously unavailable or could not have been made available at the time of the scheduled 10(k) hearing by the exercise of proper diligence. An effort was made in the 8(b)(4)(D) hearing to present testimony concerning such contract. This was excluded. The Union did not specifically alert the Administrative Law Judge or the Board that this evidence was sought to be admitted for a purpose other than the merits of the resolution of the jurisdictional dispute. We think that under the particular circumstances the Board cannot be held to have acted arbitrarily in treating this case as being made on a record that did not contain a showing of the contract. In that limited fact setting, we see no substantial basis for sustaining petitioner\u2019s contentions that the order exceeded the Board\u2019s authority. The petition to review will be denied. The Board\u2019s cross-petition for enforcement of its order will be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-10\">So ordered.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b406-15\">.
