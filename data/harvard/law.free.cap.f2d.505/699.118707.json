He claimed that insiders and institutions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>owned so large a portion of the 5,573,895 Levitz shares outstanding that the \u201cfloat\u201d \u2014 or public ownership \u2014 was \u201conly\u201d 1.3. million shares. This, he asserted, was inadequate in light of existing demand, and gave rise to liability based on ASE Rules 170 and 177, \u00a7 6 of the Securities Exchange Act, and rule 10b-5. Judge Lasker dismissed the action under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-4\">The gist of Sehonholtz\u2019s complaint is that Ramsey and ASE failed in their obligation to insure a market in which float would be adequate, yet the complaint fails to disclose a source for such an obligation. Rule 170 of ASE, on which he relies most heavily, limits the affirmative duty of the specialist to \u201cassist in the maintenance, insofar as reasonably practicable, of a fair and orderly market\u201d to a requirement that he</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b796-5\">engage, to a reasonable degree under the existing circumstances, in dealings for his own account . . . when lack of price continuity or lack of depth in the full lot market or temporary disparity between supply and demand . . . exists or is reasonably to be anticipated.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b796-8\">ASE Rule 170(d). It is thus apparent that the rule is concerned with temporary dislocations in trading, rather than a condition of inadequate float which might persist, as Schonholtz alleged, for two years.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-9\">Indeed, the very definition of \u201cfair and orderly\u201d which Schonholtz cites in his brief (P. 24), demonstrates the error of his reliance on the rule:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b796-10\">\u201cFair\u201d and \u201chonest\u201d presumably encompass the notion of freedom from manipulative and deceptive practices of all kinds and may be regarded as positive expressions of the act\u2019s ban on such practices, acts, and devices. \u201cOrderly\u201d presumably implies efficiency and economy of operations, but also embraces concepts of regularity and reliability of operation \u2014 \u201ca market which does not \u2018fold up\u2019 when the pressure on dealers becomes too heavy\u201d and the concept of avoidance of wide price swings within relatively short spans of time.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b796-14\">Securities and Exchange Commission, Report of Special Study of Securities Markets, H.R. Doc. No. 95, 88th Cong., 1st Sess., pt. 2, ch. V, 14,15 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b796-15\">Even the most charitable reading of Schonholtz\u2019s allegation that Levitz stock traded at artificially high prices falls short of a charge that the market had \u201cfolded up\u201d or otherwise failed to comply with the elements of the above definition. Thus, even if a private right of action otherwise exists for violation of Rule 170, a matter which we need not decide, <em>see </em>Colonial Realty Corp. v. Bache &amp; Co., 358 F.2d 178 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 385 U.S. 817, 87 S.Ct. 40, 17 L.Ed.2d 56 (1966), no valid claim is asserted here.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-16\">Schonholtz\u2019s reliance on ASE Rule 177 is equally misplaced. It is farfetched to assume that the specialist\u2019s duty under Rule 177(a) to report <em>\u201cunusual </em>activity or price change\u201d imposes upon him the obligation to report an inadequate float that allegedly persisted for two years, a matter which is hardly \u201cactivity,\u201d surely not a \u201cprice change,\u201d and certainly not \u201cunusual.\u201d And it is obvious that the market conditions alleged by Schonholtz are by no means conventionally thought of as \u201cmaterial information,\u201d the subject of Rule 177(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b796-17\">Given that the facts alleged show no violation of ASE rules, the claims based on \u00a7 6 and rule 10b-5 fail as well. Schonholtz maintains that under \u00a7 6, the ASE has the duty to enforce its rules and the securities laws, and is liable to a private party if that duty is violated. Without pausing to discuss the merits of this assertion, <em>see </em>Baird v. Franklin, 141 F.2d 238 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 323 U. S. 737, 65 S.Ct. 38, 89 L.Ed. 591 (1944), we note that no valid claim based on a failure to enforce rules can exist.when no rules were violated. Similarly, the 10b-5 claim is based on an alleged implied representation by ASE and Ram<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>sey that the float in Levitz stock was adequate. But the complaint does not suggest any possible source for such an implied representation other than the ASE rules and \u00a7 6, nor do we perceive any. Thus, at most ASE and Ramsey represented that all relevant statutes and ASE rules were complied with; and it is apparent from what we have already said that none of Schonholtz\u2019s allegations establishes that this representation was false.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b795-25\"> Bear, Stearns &amp; Co., Ramsey\u2019s parent, was also joined as a defendant because of the claim it was a \u201ccontrolling person\u201d under \u00a7 20 of the Securities Exchange Act, and the complaint was dismissed as to it as well,</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
