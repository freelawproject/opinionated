D. Lazier sought damages for an alleged conspiracy to prevent him from exercising his right to express his views and to picket a place of public accommodation which employed a racially restrictive patronage policy. By a pre-trial stipulation, the contention was sharpened to assert a conspiracy to have plaintiff arrested because of his inquiries about the integration of this establishment. The complaint also included claims for false arrest and malicious prosecution. Upon the conclusion of an extensive hearing, the district court directed a verdict for the defendants. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-6\">Examination of the tediously-tried, objection-filled transcript reveals that on at least one occasion prior to the night of his arrest Lazier, a Negro, had indeed threatened to integrate the premises of the Nook Bar, a public tavern, after being advised by its management that blacks were not served there, except for off-premises consumption. The reason plaintiff did not get his claims to the jury despite this favorable start, can be found in the remaining proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-7\">In the following statement of events which culminated in plaintiff\u2019s arrest, we have resolved all conflicts and inferences most favorably to plaintiff\u2019s position. Boeing Co. v. Shipman, 411 F.2d 365 (5th Cir. 1969). Late in the night of August 1, 1971 Reverend Lazier was operating his automobile on the streets of Bradenton, Florida when he observed a widowed member of his congregation, Violet Thomas. He picked up Mrs. Thomas and they drove to the home of Shirley Murray, a friend of Mrs. Thomas, and asked her to go with them to \u201cpick up a beer some place.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> When Mrs. Murray accepted and joined the group she had her hair put up on rollers and was wearing a bathrobe.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-8\">No precise chronology for the pastor and his ladies was established, but at approximately'2:00 a.m. on August 2 the party arrived at the Nook Bar. Reverend Lazier ordered two or three cans of beer from the take-out window and then backed his car across the street onto the apron of a service station. At that point he noted a sheriff\u2019s patrol car drive onto the parking lot of the Nook Bar and decided to wait to see if the officer was \u201cgoing to buy some whiskey or something.\u201d Instead the officer, after conversing with the manager, walked across the street and told Reverend Lazier, \u201cThese people [the operators of the Nook Bar] don\u2019t want your business there no more.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b993-11\">The following excerpts from the testimony of Reverend Lazier most aptly describe the next sequence of events:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b993-12\">Q. All right. Now, up to this point, may I assume that your reason for being there at the Nook was that you wanted to buy some beer ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b993-13\">A. Correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b993-14\">Q. That is the only reason you were there ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b993-15\">A. Eminently correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b993-16\">* * X X X X-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b993-17\">Q. You didn\u2019t go there to picket;- did you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b993-18\">A. No sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b993-19\">Q. You didn\u2019t go there to express your views; did you ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b993-20\">A. I went there to get a beer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b993-21\">X X X X X- X-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b993-22\">Q. All right, Reverend Lazier. As a matter of fact, isn\u2019t it true the reason you drove back there was simply because [Deputy Sheriff] Steve Abrams told you not to ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b993-23\">A. Well, I guess that is part of it. Nobody tells me where I can go, you know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b993-24\">XXX X X X</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b993-25\">Q. But he did tell you, \u201cDon\u2019t go back on there because the people don\u2019t want you on there ?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b994-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"898\">*898</page-number>A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b994-4\">Q. And you took that as a dare; didn\u2019t you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b994-6\">A. Certainly so.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b994-7\">Q. And you took his dare, and you went back on there ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b994-9\">A. Eminently correct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b994-10\">When Reverend Lazier drove back on the parking lot of the Nook Bar Deputy Sheriff Abrams arrested him for trespassing after warning, pursuant to Fla. Stat.Ann. \u00a7 821.01.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-11\">In this case the law arises from the facts. The reasoning which brought about the Nook\u2019s call for assistance by the sheriff and its manager\u2019s request to Deputy Abrams to \u201cbar\u201d Reverend Lazier this night appears with less than crystal clarity. The Nook\u2019s sole employee at this hour stated that she became frightened when Lazier observed to her that the parking lot contained only one car other than her own and that' it was almost closing time. She also testified she feared that if he came inside the bar and other customers came in, a fight might start. The Deputy Sheriff testified that when he arrived at the scene the barmaid told him that Reverend Lazier had asked her to go out with him. It is plain, however, that Reverend Lazier possessed absolutely no intention or purpose of desegregating the Nook Bar on this occasion, and no reasonable juror could have thought such would be his purpose. Indeed, Reverend Lazier himself testified that his intentions to picket the establishment would have involved conduct during daylight hours rather than at night. His companions on this occasion were among the most unlikely he could have selected for demonstrating against segregation. While the barmaid may have had his threats to integrate in mind when she asked Officer Abrams to prevent his return, that threat of action at another time had nothing to do with his 2:00 a. m. arrest. The proof established beyond cavil that his arrest resulted when he \u201ctook the dare.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b994-13\">The District Judge correctly applied the law by directing a verdict on plaintiff\u2019s first count, which charged a conspiracy to prevent the exercise of plaintiff\u2019s rights of expression and to picket. The court also acted within the permissible ambit of its discretion in declining to continue to exercise pendent jurisdiction to try the remaining counts of the complaint, which asserted false arrest and malicious prosecution. United Mine Workers v. Gibbs, 383 U.S. 715, 86 S.Ct. 1130, 16 L.Ed.2d 218 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b994-14\">The judgment appealed from is</p>\n<p id=\"b994-15\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b993-9\">. The state of Mrs. Thomas\u2019 sobriety during the ensuing events is in conflict. However, she admitted having consumed several highballs earlier in the evening, was arrested for public drunkenness and did forfeit bail pn this charge.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
