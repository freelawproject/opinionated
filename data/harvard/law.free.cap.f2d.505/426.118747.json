He was convicted of violating \u00a7 841 of the Act, which forbids prescriptions without authorization. We find \u00a7 841 inapplicable to appellant and reverse his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-7\">Our conclusion is reached by force of the established principle that \u201cwhen [a] choice has to be made between two readings of what conduct Congress had made a crime, it is appropriate, before we choose the harsher alternative, to require that Congress should have spoken in language that is clear and definite.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This rule, of course, cannot serve to \u201coverride evident statutory purpose.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In the search for an \u201cevident statutory purpose,\u201d our analysis necessarily covers a complex maze of statutory language, regulatory provisions, and previous legislation.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-9\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b523-10\">Methadone is an addictive drug which can be used in the treatment of narcotics addiction.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> A heroin addict who switches to methadone may experience neither a craving for heroin nor a euphoric \u201chigh.\u201d Moreover, methadone can be taken orally once a day, while heroin must often be injected several times a day.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-16\">There are two general approaches to the use of methadone in treating addicts \u2014maintenance and detoxification. Under a system of maintenance, a large dose of methadone is given once a day for an indefinite period in order to keep the patient from taking heroin. In detoxification, the less controversial approach, a large dose of methadone is given for the first few days in order to keep the patient free of withdrawal symptoms. The dose is then gradually reduced, ultimately to achieve abstinence from all drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-17\">The evidence at appellant\u2019s trial established that from August, 1971 to February, 1972 appellant prescribed methadone to numerous patients: Under the Controlled Substance Act only those doctors who have obtained registration from the Attorney General can prescribe a \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d such as methadone.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Appellant had obtained such registration for the period in question and it was never revoked during that period.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-18\">Appellant contended at trial that he prescribed methadone in good faith for detoxification. The government argued that appellant was no more than a \u201cpusher\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-19\">[H]e used the physician\u2019s cloak as a cover to sell drugs . . . There was no medical purpose behind this\u2014 there was only one purpose: money.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b523-21\">As appellant concedes in his brief to this court,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the evidence at trial established that he engaged in certain highly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>irregular practices during the period in question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-4\">1. ) He prescribed methadone in whatever quantities the patient requested ;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-5\">2. ) His fees were graduated in accordance with the quantity of methadone prescribed;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-6\">3. ) He did not make certain that the patients for whom he was prescribing methadone were addicts. Some were not, and some delivered their methadone to non-patients.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b524-7\">In a 639-count indictment filed June 27, 1972,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> appellant was charged with violating \u00a7 841(a) of the Controlled Substances Act;</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-8\">(a) Except as authorized by this subchapter, it shall be unlawful for any person knowingly or intentionally\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-9\">(1) to . . . distribute, or dispense [that is, prescribe] a controlled substance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b524-12\">When appellant was arraigned, the trial judge told the prosecutor that the theory of the government\u2019s case would have to be spelled out in greater detail since \u201cthe indictment doesn\u2019t tell the defendant anything.\u201d Accordingly, at a pre-trial hearing government counsel offered an oral bill of particulars. Counsel noted that pursuant to a provision in the Controlled Substances Act the Attorney General had promulgated regulations governing those registered to prescribe controlled substances. The government relied on appellant\u2019s alleged violation of one of those regulations:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-13\">[Government Counsel]: [T]he Government would rely on the Section numbered 306.04. And, the two main sections or the two main parts of that section that apply to this case, that is, the specific theories of the Government\u2019s case, is section (a) which states in part: \u201cA prescription for a controlled substance to be effective must be issued for a legitimate medical purpose by an individual practitioner, acting in the usual course of his professional practice.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-16\">It is the Government\u2019s contention and theory that the conduct by Dr. Moore in giving out these prescriptions was not for a legitimate medical purpose, and secondly, that he was not acting in the usual course of his professional practice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-17\">The second aspect of that regulation is part (c), which states in part: \u201cA prescription may not be issued for the dispensing of narcotic drugs to a drug addict for the purposes of continuing his dependence upon such drugs.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-18\">It is the Government\u2019s contention that these prescriptions were issued to maintain these drug addicts as drug addicts, and that he was not issuing these prescriptions to detoxify them, but retaining them as drug addicts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-19\">So, that really boils down to the end result of what I stated, that he was conducting methadone maintenance or maintaining drug addicts rather than detoxifying them as he was only authorized to do by his regulations, and by his violation of these regulations he violated 841(a) of the CSA.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-20\">THE COURT: I will take that statement which you made, Mr. Alto, in the nature of a Bill of Particulars, and limit your proof accordingly, and it will be of notice to [defense counsel] as to the theory of the case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-22\">[Government Counsel]: Yes, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b524-23\">Appellant\u2019s trial commenced on October 17, 1972. After the prosecution rested, the defense moved for a judgment of acquittal, noting that the government had failed to establish that appellant was not authorized to write prescriptions for methadone. The motion was denied. After the defense rested, the court, in keeping with the govern<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>ment\u2019s theory of the case, instructed the jury that it had to find:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"aby-dedup-0\">beyond a reasonable doubt that a physician who knowingly or intentionally did dispense or distribute [methadone] by prescription, did so other than in good faith for detoxification in the usual course of a professional practice and in accordance with a standard of medical practice generally recognized and accepted in the United States.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">The jury returned a verdict of guilty on 22 counts. Appellant was sentenced to prison terms of five to fifteen years on each of fourteen counts, all to run concurrently, and ten to thirty years on each of the remaining eight counts, to run concurrently to each other but consecutively to the first set of sentences. Fines totalling $150,000 were also imposed.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b525-7\">Appellant contends that his indictment must be dismissed because \u00a7 841 of the Controlled Substances Act does not apply to doctors registered to dispense methadone. He argues that if he acted unlawfully he was subject to trial only under those sections of the statute which specifically govern the activities of registered doctors \u2014 sections with less severe penalties than those in \u00a7 841. This contention is the only one we address. We do not decide under what circumstances, if any, an individual such as appellant could lawfully administer a methadone maintenance program. Nor do we decide whether appellant was in fact maintaining addicts, detoxifying them, or simply pushing drugs. We may assume that appellant, a licensed physician registered to prescribe methadone, acted wrongfully. We are only concerned with the consequences of such action.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-13\">There is support in the language and history of \u00a7 822 of the Act for appellant\u2019s contention that \u00a7 841 does not apply to him. \u00a7 822(b) specifically provides that persons registered by the Attorney General to dispense controlled substances are \u201cauthorized [to do so] to the extent authorized by their registration and in conformity with the other provisions of this subchapter.\u201d The language echoes the \u201cexcept as authorized\u201d language of \u00a7 841, suggesting immunity for registrants from the penal sanctions provided for in that section. Of course, that a registrant is \u201cauthorized . . to the extent authorized\u201d lends some credence to a theory that Congress did not intend authorization for registrants to extend beyond compliance with the other provisions of the Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-15\">The legislative history of \u00a7 822, however, weighs against such a theory. The Act, as it was originally passed by the Senate,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> did not contain a section comparable to \u00a7 822(b). The provision was inserted by the House Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce, which flatly stated in its report that the purpose of the addition was \u201cto make it clear that persons registered under this title are authorized to deal in or handle controlled substances.\u201d <footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The Committee\u2019s explanation contains no suggestion that it intended to authorize only registrants who complied in every way with responsibilities established under other sections of the Act.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b526-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>Appellant\u2019s reading of \u00a7 841 gathers further support from its place in the overall scheme of the Act. The Act insures the close regulation of registrants. Section 822(f) gives the Attorney General authority to inspect the offices of registrants. Standards and procedures are set forth in \u00a7 824 for revoking or suspending an individual\u2019s registration; revocation and suspension, as tools for the administrative control of the flow of drugs, have recently been strengthened by the passage of the Narcotic Addict Treatment Act.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Under \u00a7\u00a7 828 and 829, requirements are detailed for the proper order forms and prescriptions in the distribution or prescription of drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-4\">This administrative machinery is backed up by the penalties provided for in \u00a7\u00a7 842 and 843. \u00a7 842 outlaws issuing prescriptions in violation of \u00a7 829, mislabelling drugs and similar misconduct. Violators of \u00a7 842 are subject to a civil penalty of $25,000 and, if a violation is knowing, a criminal penalty of a year imprisonment and a fine of $25,000. \u00a7 843 defines more serious offenses for registrants, such as distributing a controlled substance when there is no proper order form and using a fictitious registration number. Violations are punishable by four years\u2019 imprisonment and a $30,000 fine.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-9\">In contrast to \u00a7\u00a7 842 and 843, \u00a7 841 does not mention \u201cregistrants\u201d as the focus of any of its provisions. It provides for sentences of up to 15 years and fines of up to $25,000. This broad outline strongly suggests that Congress intended to deal with registrants primarily through a system of administrative controls, relying on modest penalty provisions to enforce those controls, and reserving the severe penalties provided for in \u00a7 841. for those seeking to avoid regulation entirely by not registering.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-10\">As already noted, the regulations which served the Government as a bill of particulars in appellant\u2019s trial appear in \u00a7 306.04 of the regulations implementing the statute. Part 306 is specifically limited to:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-11\">[rjules governing the issuance, filling, and filing of prescriptions pursuant to ... 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 829 . . . <footnotemark>13</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b526-12\">Punishment for violation of \u00a7 829 is specifically provided for in \u00a7 842. Against the statutory background which we have sketched, it cannot have been evident to appellant that he would <em>also </em>be punishable under \u00a7 841(a), which makes no reference to \u00a7 829 or the obligations which it imposes on registrants.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b527-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">The government seeks to justify its prosecution of appellant by reference to judicial construction of the Harrison Narcotic Act of 1914,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> the predecessor of the Controlled Substances Act. In order to evaluate this contention we must consider the structure of the Harrison Act. Section 1 required that persons selling or prescribing certain narcotics register with the \u201ccollector of internal revenue of [their] district\u201d and pay an annual tax. Section 2 made it unlawful to sell or prescribe narcotics except to persons with order forms issued by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue. Section 2 exempted the prescribing \u201cof any of the aforesaid drugs to a patient by a physican . . . [regularly] registered under this Act in the course of his professional practice only . . .\u201d All violations of the Act were punished under Section 9 by imprisonment of up to five years and fines of up to $2,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-8\">The government notes that under court decisions construing the Harrison Act a physician could lose his exemption from Section 2 by distributing drugs in an unprofessional manner.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> They refer to decisions such as Jin Fuey Moy v. United States, in which the Supreme Court held in 1920 that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-9\">Manifestly the phrases \u201cto a patient\u201d and \u201cin the course of his professional practice only\u201d are intended to confine the immunity of a registered .physician, in dispensing the narcotic drugs mentioned in the act, strictly within the appropriate bounds of a physician\u2019s professional practice, and not to extend it to include a sale to a dealer or a distribution intended to cater to the appetite or satisfy the craving of one addicted to the use of the drug. A \u201cprescription\u201d issued for either of the latter purposes protects neither the physician who issues it nor the dealer who knowingly accepts and fills it.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b527-15\">The government maintains that the foregoing principles are \u201canalogously dispositive\u201d <footnotemark>18</footnotemark> and dictate that under the Controlled Substances Act appellant was stripped of his exemption from \u00a7 841 by his unprofessional conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-16\">The Controlled Substances Act, however, is fundamentally different from the Harrison Narcotic Act. Indeed, as its legislative history indicates, the Controlled Substances Act replaces the Harrison Act\u2019s single penalty provision with a series of penalty provisions specifically designed to treat registered and unregistered individuals differently.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-17\">The penalty provisions now embodied in \u00a7\u00a7 841, 842, and 843 of the Controlled Substances Act were first before Congress when the Senate considered the Controlled Dangerous Substances Act of 1969. \u00a7\u00a7 501-503 of the Senate bill<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> contained the identical offenses as \u00a7\u00a7 841-843: \u00a7 501 outlawed drug dealing by those not \u201cauthorized\u201d under the Act; \u00a7 502 prohibited, <em>inter alia, </em>actions by registrants which violated the \u201cprescriptions\u201d section;<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> and \u00a7 503 prohibited, <em>inter alia, </em>distribution by registrants in the absence of proper order forms. The relative severity of the penalties was also identical to the present Act: the most severe penalty was for vi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>olation of \u00a7 501, the least severe for violation of \u00a7 502.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-4\">The Judiciary Committee\u2019s Report on the Senate bill states that while \u00a7 501 applies to \u201ctraffickers,\u201d <footnotemark>21</footnotemark> \u00a7 502 contains \u201cpenalties . . . for those involved in the legitimate drug trade,\u201d <footnotemark>22</footnotemark> and \u00a7 503 contains \u201cfurther penalties . for registrants for illegal distribution of [controlled] drugs . . . \u201d <footnotemark>23</footnotemark> The Section-By-Section Analysis in the Report states that \u00a7 502 makes it unlawful to prescribe a controlled substance \u201ccontrary to the terms of registration requirements,\u201d <footnotemark>24</footnotemark> and \u00a7 503 makes it unlawful to distribute controlled substances \u201ccontrary to registration requirements and contrary to order forms established by the Attorney General.\u201d <footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Thus it was clear at the time of the Senate Report that \u00a7\u00a7 502-503 (\u00a7\u00a7 842-843) were designed to regulate registrants \u2014 those within the legitimate drug business \u2014 while \u00a7 501 (\u00a7 841) was for those outside of legitimate channels. The debtate on the floor of the Senate confirms this view. Senator Dodd, the manager of the bill and chairman of the relevant subcommittee, noted that \u00a7\u00a7 502-503 provided penalties \u201cfor those involved in the legitimate drug trade.\u201d <footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Senator Hruska, a leading proponent of the bill and a member of Senator Dodd\u2019s subcommittee, emphasized that the Harrison Act was outdated.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> He explained that in the Senate bill \u201cwe are not merely redecorating the existing legal structure. Rather we have laid a new foundation . . . \u201d <footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Senator Hruska further noted that in the Senate bill \u201cthe penalties are tailored to fit the crime and the person who committed that crime.\u201d <footnotemark>29</footnotemark> He described \u00a7 501 as applying to \u201ctraffickers,\u201d <footnotemark>30</footnotemark> and \u00a7\u00a7 502 and 503 as defining \u201coffenses committed by registrants.\u201d <footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b528-19\">On January 28, 1970, the Controlled Dangerous Substances Act passed the Senate. The House then held hearings in the field. On September 10, 1970, the House Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce reported out the bill which became the present Act.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> The three penalty provisions passed by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>Senate were retained in the House bill.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> The House Committee\u2019s Report emphasized the unique structure of the proposed legislation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-5\">The bill provides for control by the Justice Department of problems related to drug abuse through registration of manufacturers, wholesalers, retailers, and all others in the legitimate distribution chain, and makes transactions outside the legitimate chain illegal.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">Thus the House Committee was aware, as the Senate was, of a distinction between \u00a7 841, which covers unauthorized individuals, and \u00a7\u00a7 842 and 843, which cover those in the \u201clegitimate distribution chain.\u201d The House Report notes that \u201cmore or less technical violations\u201d are set forth in \u00a7 842 <footnotemark>35</footnotemark> \u2014 there is no comparable explanatory phrase concerning \u00a7 841 or \u00a7 843. We find no merit in the government\u2019s view that this phrase mandates that appellant be tried under \u00a7 841 since his violations were not \u201ctechnical.\u201d At most, the phrase might indicate that \u00a7 843, which has more severe penalties than \u00a7 842, be used for certain serious offenses committed by those within the legitimate distribution chain. In any event, the phrase \u201cmore or less technical violations\u201d is hardly self-explanatory \u2014 the penalty for a knowing violation of \u00a7 842 includes a year imprisonment, implying that Congress was concerned with serious misbehavior.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b529-12\">The House Report provides further support for the view that the Controlled Substance Act fundamentally revises the penalty structure of the Harrison Act. The Report, in its discussion of the need for medical treatment for narcotics addicts,<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> cites with approval the reports of two Presidential Commissions \u2014 the Prettyman Commission of 1963<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> and the Katzenbach Commission of 1967.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> Both Commissions noted the difficulties physicians faced under the Harrison Act, where a controversial drug prescription for a patient could result in a doctor being punished as a pusher<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> The House Report quoted at length from the Prettyman Commission\u2019s discussion of this problem, including its references to the very line of cases relied on by the government in this appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-13\">Since the passage of the Harrison Act of 1914, the Federal narcotics laws have expressly permitted a physician to prescribe narcotic drugs for a patient in the course of \u201cprofessional practice only\u201d and for \u201clegitimate medical uses\u201d and \u201clegitimate medical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>purposes.\u201d Under this statutory language there is no doubt that a physician may prescribe narcotic drugs for a patient suffering acute pain or from a painful and incurable disease. But a controversy has existed for 50 years over the extent to which narcotic drugs may be administered to an addict solely because he is an addict.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-4\">During the first 10 years following enactment of the Harrison Act, the Supreme Court affirmed several convictions under the act involving the indiscriminate prescribing of narcotic drugs for addicts. In 1925, however, in Linder v. United States, 268 U.S. 5, 45 S.Ct. 446, 69 L.Ed. 819, the Court indicated that the dispensing of narcotic drugs by a physician for the purpose of relieving conditions incident to addiction was not in every instance a violation of the act. .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-5\">The regulations of the Bureau of Narcotics, however, do not seem to be in accord with [Linder]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-6\">The practicing physician has thus been confused as to when he may prescribe narcotic drugs for an addict. Out of a fear of prosecution many physicians refuse to use narcotics in the treatment of addicts except occasionally in a withdrawal regimen lasting no longer than a few weeks. In most instances they shun addicts as patients.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b530-7\">We are aware, as the dissent notes,<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> that this passage appears in the House Report\u2019s consideration of a section of the Act which provides for the determination of \u201cappropriate methods of treatment for addicts\u201d in order to \u201cclarify for the medical profession in the United States the extent to which they may safely go in treating narcotic addicts as patients.\u201d<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> Yet the publication of acceptable methods, as one response to the impact of the <em>Linder </em>holding, does not exclude the implementation of other responses as well, including the exemption of registered practitioners from some penalty provisions. In any event, the general concern of Congress expressed here, taken together with the other aspects of the Act\u2019s legislative history which we have reviewed, forcibly undermines the Government\u2019s position that precedents under the Harrison Act should be considered \u201canalogously dis-positive.\u201d <footnotemark>44</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b530-15\">Reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-16\">APPENDIX I</p>\n<p id=\"b530-17\">Selected Provisions of the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 801 et seq.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-19\">\u00a7 802.

Act of May 14, 1974, Pub.L.No. 93-281, 88 Stat. 124.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">That Act amended \u00a7\u00a7 822 and 824, which provides for the revocation and suspension of registrations. It requires a special registration for practitioners administering maintenance or detoxification programs and authorizes tlie Attorney General to revoke this registration for failure to meet standards which he is authorized to promulgate. The dissent contends that the legislative history of NATA refutes our reading of \u00a7 841. The case of Dr. Moore is discussed in the Senate Report on NATA as a \u201cmost notorious\u201d example of the diversion of drugs for illicit use and sale by a registered practitioner, and his conviction and the length of his sentence are noted with apparent approval. S.Rep.No. 93-192, 93 Cong., 1st Sess. 7 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b526-7\">NATA, of course, was passed after this appeal had been briefed and argued in our court, and there is a question therefore as to how much its history can be relied on in meeting appellant\u2019s arguments. In any event, it seems to us that Congress\u2019 approbation of Dr. Moore\u2019s conviction is not strong evidence of its purpose in passing \u00a7 841, which incidentally was enacted some four years earlier by a differently constituted Senate and House. Section 841, in fact, is not considered in the Senate or House Reports on NATA, and with good reason, for Congress\u2019 central concern in the passage of that Act was not criminal prosecutions at all but the deregistration of abusers. The step which it took is perfectly consistent with the view that its broad intent, from the outset, was to deal with registrants through administrative controls rather than the harsh penal provisions of \u00a7 841.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b526-14\">. 36 Fed.Reg. 7799 (1971).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b526-15\">.

The Government also relies, by way of judicial authority, on three decisions in other circuits in conflict with our holding here. The first of these is United States v. Bartee, 479 F.2d 484 (10th Cir. 1973), wherein \u00a7 841 was held to apply to a licensed physician found to be in violation of \u00a7 829 and the regulations thereunder. The court\u2019s reasoning rested on an agreement between the parties that \u201cthe provisions exempting medical practitioners are found in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 829 (a) and (b) and 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 306.04.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 488. The court therefore never considered the effect of \u00a7 822, providing for the registration of dispensing physicians, which is the cornerstone of appellant\u2019s claim of exemption in this case. The later cases of United States v. Jobe, 487 F.2d 268 (10th Cir. 1973), and United States v. Leigh, 487 F.2d 206 (5th Cir. 1973), rely solely upon <em>Bartee. </em>As we respond to a line of reasoning which was not explored in any of these cases, we do not consider them persuasive authority.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b540-23\">MacKINNON, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"A0d\">dissenting:</p>\n<p id=\"b540-24\">The majority today reverses the conviction of a medical doctor, clearly prov<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>en to be a drug pusher (trafficker), on the ground that he was prosecuted under the wrong section of the Controlled Substances Act. They reach this result despite the fact that the section is aimed at drug pushers and \u201ctraffickers,\u201d which Dr. Moore clearly was. The majority holds that the authorization of a doctor to dispense controlled substances for legitimate medical purposes absolutely immunizes him from prosecution under section 401(a) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a) (1970), even when he dispenses narcotic drugs clearly for illegitimate purposes. The majority thus holds that Congress intended to exempt trafficking doctors, merely because they were doctors, from the penalties applicable to other traffickers. The fatal defect in this holding is the failure to recognize that the provision of section 401(a) which excepts authorized conduct does not create a special class of <em>persons </em>immune from prosecution for trafficking; rather, it recognizes the legality of the <em>acts and conduct </em>of a physician when he dispenses a narcotic drug in good faith for a legitimate medical purpose consistent with the terms of his registration under the Act. The remainder of this opinion points out that the terms of the Act, its prior and subsequent legislative history, and plain common sense demonstrate the fallacy of the majority\u2019s approach to this case. I therefore respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-15\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b541-16\">Dr. Moore, a physician registered under the Act to dispense methadone for detoxification purposes,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> was charged in a 639-count indictment<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> filed June 27, 1972, with the knowing and unlawful distribution and dispensation of methadone (dolophine), a Schedule II narcotic drug controlled substance,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> in violation of section 401(a), 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a) (1970). Dr. Moore was tried by jury on a retyped indictment containing thirty-eight counts of the original indictment and was convicted on twenty-two of those counts.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> **He was sentenced to concurrent prison terms of five to fifteen years on fourteen counts, and ten to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>thirty years on the remaining eight counts, to run concurrently with each other but consecutively to the other sentences. He was fined a total of $150,000, a special parole term of twelve years was imposed on each count, to run concurrently as to all counts, and his license to practice medicine in the District of Columbia was revoked pursuant to D.C.Code \u00a7 2-131.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\">The conditions at Dr. Moore\u2019s office are indicative of what transpired there and place his dispensing of methadone and his \u201ctreatment\u201d of narcotic addicts in perspective. For example, the Doctor employed two armed guards at his office, one of whom carried a .38 caliber pistol which he kept beside him or in his belt, a loaded shotgun, held in both hands with the muzzle pointed upwards (Tr. at 374), and a blackjack (Tr. at 376). The other guard, stationed in the hallway, carried a .45 caliber handgun which he held at the ready in his hand (Tr. at 375). Dr. Moore had a German shepherd dog which sat beside him on the floor in his inner office (Tr. at 376), and on at least one occasion he had a .22 caliber handgun on his desk (Tr. at 129). On another occasion a patient was standing in the hallway outside the office and was told by a guard to move. When he did not respond, \u201cfists [started] flying,\u201d and the guard \u201cknocked him down the steps\u201d and out of the office (Tr. at 130-32).</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">It is unnecessary to recount here the testimony of all the witnesses for the Government which established beyond any doubt the illegal activity of Dr. Moore, since it was substantially cumulative. Rather, the general pattern that emerges from the evidence is detailed and then several representative case histories are discussed.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">On a patient\u2019s first visit to Dr. Moore's office a nurse would request identification, give the patient several forms to complete, take his weight, height and blood pressure, and request an unsupervised urine specimen. After standing in line for one or two hours with up to 100 other patients, he would finally see Dr. Moore. Moore would ask the patient to display track marks and then ask what he could do for him. The patient would ask for a prescription for dolophine pills. Moore would inform the patient that a prescription for 50 pills was $15, 75 pills for $25, 100 pills for $35 and 150 pills for $50. The patient generally would request and invariably receive a prescription for as many pills as he could afford.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-8\">Appointments were never required and return visits followed the same gen-, eral pattern as initial visits but without any physical examination. The established pattern on return visits was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-9\">I would go in there, the secretary would take my name; and she would put my folder out and put it in line, you know; on top of the other ones; and when it was my turn, he would call me in the office .... (Tr. II 285.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-10\">* * * * * #</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-11\">He would ask how many I wanted, and 50, 75 or a hundred, he told me the price; and I told him how much I wanted; and I paid him. (Tr. II 265.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b542-12\">Each witness was able to procure a prescription for any number of dolophine pills for which he had sufficient cash on hand. Moore generally did not inquire about the daily dosages of his patients and did not give directions as to their proper use.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-13\">Bobby James King, a twenty-two year old student at Howard University (Tr. at 57), first went to Dr. Moore with a friend who had visited Moore before. The friend obtained the pills which they then shared, each paying half. He returned to Dr. Moore\u2019s on his own (Tr. at 60) because methadone \u201cwas cheaper [than heroin] and [he] could get high\u201d (Tr. at 88). He went to Moore not for detoxification but only to procure as much methadone as possible from the Doctor (Tr. at 90-91), since he could get higher on methadone than on heroin (Tr. at 85).</p>\n<p id=\"b543-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>The procedure King went through to join Dr. Moore\u2019s program included producing identification to prove he was twenty-one or over and giving an unsupervised urine specimen (Tr. at 61). Blood pressure may have been taken (Tr. at 61, 94-95) and height and weight noted, and finally King saw Dr. Moore, who examined his arms for track marks (Tr. at 63, 95). He then received a half bottle of liquid methadone and a prescription for dolophine pills. On subsequent visits the Doctor typically would ask, \u201cWhat can I do for you?\u201d and King would respond \u201c100 pills or 50, depending upon the amount of money I had.\u201d (Tr. at 65, 113). After filling the prescription, King ingested a sufficient number of dolophines to get high and sold the rest on the street at $1.50 per pill (Tr. at 67). He began by taking two to three dolophines per day and at the end of his \u201cdetoxification\u201d treatment his daily dosage was 30-35 dolo-phines. <em>Id. </em>On several occasions King visited Moore twice on one day and received his second prescription for the day without any questions asked (Tr. at 69). He finally quit methadone after Moore\u2019s office was closed down: \u201cI just cold turkey kicked it.\u201d (Tr. at 78.)</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">Karen Bryan, a plain clothes policewoman with the Metropolitan Police Department assigned to undercover narcotics duty, visited the Doctor under an assumed name (Tr. at 133-35). She was not, of course, a narcotics user (Tr. at 136) but nonetheless was able to obtain prescriptions for dolophine pills from Moore. After the usual minimal examination she saw Moore for about three minutes, exhibited her \u201ctracks,\u201d placed there in a police clinic, and Moore wrote a prescription for 50 dolophines. When leaving, Officer Bryan asked the nurse, \u201cHow much for a visit?\u201d, the nurse laughed and said, \u201cnothing.\u201d (Tr. at 137-38.) On subsequent visits her conversations with Dr. Moore were limited to telling him how many pills she desired (Tr. at 139). Although her urinalysis was negative as to all types of narcotics (Tr. at 146), Moore never referred to the test results (Tr. at 141).</p>\n<p id=\"b543-7\">Forris Ensor went from 5 to 70 dolo-phines per day while under Dr. Moore\u2019s \u201cdetoxification\u201d treatment program (Tr. at 171), but Moore never questioned him about the ever-increasing dosages (Tr. at 194). Roger Wheeler \u201cjust gave him the money and got the prescription\u201d (Tr. at 200), always used the dolophines to get high (Tr. at 203) and bought as many as he could afford (Tr. at 200, 202). Ivan Gower was not examined for track marks (Tr. at 240); he asked Moore to detoxify him and Moore replied that he had too many patients and not enough time to attempt detoxification (Tr. at 231). William Burgee \u201cdoctored\u201d his unsupervised urine specimen since he was not a narcotics addict (Tr. at 247), but simply purchased prescriptions for a friend (Tr. at 248). Moore never instructed his patients on the proper use of dolophine (Tr. at 254). Herbert Holland would see Moore just long enough to inform Moore of the amount of money he had available and obtain a prescription (Tr. at 286). John Mann initially was on seven dolo-phines daily, and at the end of detoxification treatment by Dr. Moore he was taking over 100 pills per day (Tr. at 310). James Frazier asked Moore how to detoxify and Moore said \u201cyou have to detox, you know, cut down, cut down,\u201d but Moore continued to give Frazier prescriptions for any amount of dolophines desired (Tr. at 323).</p>\n<p id=\"b543-8\">As established by expert medical testimony at trial, the above evidence conclusively demonstrates that Dr. Moore\u2019s detoxification treatment was not \u201cconsistent with any method . . . throughout the United States that is accepted by the medical profession in this country.\u201d (Tr. at 396, 447-50). Nothing in Dr. Moore\u2019s procedures would suggest a \u201cnew, effective, good-faith technique in the treatment, detoxificational cure of an addict.\u201d (Tr. at 474.) Moore\u2019s fee arrangement of increasing prices for a prescription based solely on the number <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>of dolophines prescribed was characterized by one medical expert as follows: \u201cThat is not only not acceptable medical practice; that is unethical medical practice.\u201d (Tr. at 452, 396-97.)</p>\n<p id=\"b544-4\">In contrast to Dr. Moore\u2019s procedures, accepted medical practice in the treatment of drug addicts dictates a complete, thorough physical examination (Tr. at 387, 447), not only to correctly diagnose their addiction but also because addicts generally are subject to other diseases that need treatment (Tr. at 447-48). The initial evaluation of a professed addict desiring treatment includes a determination as to (1) the fact of addiction, (2) the nature of the addiction, and (3) the nature of the underlying difficulties that led to addiction (Tr. at 386-87). After determining the daily dosage necessary to prevent withdrawal symptoms, detoxification begins by reducing that dosage by approximately 5-10 milligrams (the equivalent of (4 to 1 dolophines) every three days (Tr. at 441, 443). The methadone is administered daily under direct staff supervision since addicts, especially in the early stages of detoxification, cannot be trusted (Tr. at 389-90, 445). After four to six weeks an addict who proves trustworthy may be given \u201cweekend privileges,\u201d that is, two dosages to be taken without staff supervision (Tr. at 445).</p>\n<p id=\"b544-11\">Thus the evidence credited at trial by the jury conclusively establishes that Dr. Moore operated far beyond the pale of accepted medical practice. He clearly did not dispense methadone for detoxification purposes, but rather, quite simply, preyed upon the insatiable cravings of those unfortunate victims he purported to treat solely to get their money. In short, Moore was a drug pusher, a trafficker in illegal narcotics.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b544-12\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b544-13\">What sanction then, does the law impose on this drug pusher masquerading in the honorable profession of medicine? The majority opines that the manifest congressional intent is to prosecute drug-pushing doctors under a section reserved for \u201ctechnical\u201d violations, one that normally contemplates only <em>civil </em>penalties but which may result in misdemeanor penalties if the violation is done \u201cknowingly\u201d or more severe penalties if the offender is a repeater. This is facially absurd.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-14\">The basic criminal provisions of the Act impose sanctions for three types of illegal conduct. Section 401, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841, is aimed at drug pushers and traffickers in narcotics and thus provides the most severe penalties.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Section 402, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 842, is a regulatory provision primarily aimed at \u201ctechnical viola<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>tions\u201d and accordingly normally contemplates a civil rather than criminal penalty against violators; but where such violations are committed \u201cknowingly,\u201d misdemeanor punishment may be imposed if prosecuted by indictment or information.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Repeat offenders may be subjected to greater punishment. Like <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>section 402, section 403, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 843, includes a number of regulatory provisions (some applicable to registrants! but provides more severe sanctions than section 402, and also prohibits the use of communication facilities in the commission of any offense.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"a0d-dedup-0\">Section 401(a) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-4\"><em>Except as authorized </em>by this title, it shall be unlawful for <em>any </em>person knowingly or intentionally\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-5\">(1) to manufacture, distribute, or dispense ... a controlled substance ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b546-8\">21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a) (emphasis added). From a \u201cplain language\u201d perspective two things are immediately clear: (1) section 401(a) in terms applies to <em>\u201cany person\u201d </em>and (2) the exception does not state \u201cexcept for registrants,\u201d but rather, \u201cexcept as authorized.\u201d There is thus no expressed intent in the language of section 401(a) absolutely to immunize registrants, or any <em>person, </em>from prosecution under its terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-18\">The knowing dispensation of controlled substances by any person is made unlawful unless such act is authorized by some other provision of the Act. Thus, any person may defend against a charged violation of section 401(a) by proof that the Act elsewhere authorized his conduct. In the instant case, Moore would have a defense if he could prove that his conduct as a registrant was within the limits defined by his registration :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-19\">Persons registered ... to distribute, or dispense controlled substances <em>are authorized </em>to . distribute, or dispense such substances <em>... to the extent au</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number><em>thorized by their registration </em>and in conformity with the other provisions of this title.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b547-4\">Act, \u00a7 302(b), 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 822(b) (emphasis added). Dr. Moore admitted at trial that his registration authorized him to dispense methadone only for detoxification purposes in the course of professional practice (Tr. at 711-12). As demonstrated above, it was proven beyond a reasonable doubt that Dr. Moore was not dispensing methadone for detoxification purposes. Rather, he was simply pushing drugs for profit with no intention, and without the effect, of treating his \u201cpatients\u201d for <em>any </em>medical purpose. Thus, since section 401(a) only provides an exception \u201cto the extent authorized by [the applicable] registration,\u201d Dr. Moore clearly was violating section 401(a) by dispensing methadone for other than detoxification purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">The majority holds that section 401(a) simply does not apply to registrants. This holding is untenable because section 401(a) prohibits knowing or intentional \u201cdispensing\u201d and by definition of the Act registrants are practically the <em>only </em>persons who are capable of dispensing.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-6\">The term \u201cdispense\u201d means to deliver a controlled substance to an ultimate user . . . by . . .a <em>practitioner, </em>including the prescribing and administering of a controlled substance .... The term \u201cdispenser\u201d means a practitioner who so delivers a controlled substance to an ultimate user or research subject.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b547-8\">Act, section 102(10), 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 802(10) (1970) (emphasis added). And a \u201cpractitioner\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-10\">means a physician [and other professional people] . . . <em>registered . . </em>. to . . . <em>dispense . . . </em>a controlled substance <em>in the course of professional practice </em>....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b547-13\"><em>Id. </em>\u00a7 102(20), 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 802(20) (emphasis added). Accordingly, in the prohibition of unauthorized \u201cdispensing\u201d as defined by the Act, Congress clearly indicated its intention to have section 401(a) apply to all registrants.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-16\">The entire thrust of the Act, moreover, demonstrates that registered physicians are \u201cauthorized\u201d to dispense controlled substances only in the course of their professional practice, that is, for a legitimate medical purpose. The Act is replete with provisions that manifest a congressional intent to limit a registrant\u2019s authorization to conduct conforming to accepted medical practices. Section 102(20), 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 802(20) (\u201cregistered . to . dispense ... in the course of professional practice\u201d); \u00a7 202(b)(2)(B), 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 812(b)'(2)(B) (definition of Schedule II drug: \u201cThe drug . has a currently accepted medical use in treatment\u201d); \u00a7 307(c)(1)(A), 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 827(e)(1)(A) (excepting registrants from the requirement of making certain records and reports with respect to narcotics prescribed or administered \u201cby a practitioner in the lawful course of his professional practice\u201d); \u00a7 308(e), 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 828(e) (\u201cunlawful for any person to obtain . . . controlled substances for any purpose other than their use ... in the course of his professional practice\u201d); \u00a7 404(a), 21 U.S. C. \u00a7 844(a) (\u201cunlawful for any person knowingly or intentionally to possess . unless . . . obtained directly, or pursuant to a valid prescription or order, from a practitioner, while acting in the course of his professional practice\u201d); \u00a7 515(a)(2), 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 885(a)(2) (\u201cobtained pursuant to a valid prescription from a practitioner while acting in the course of his professional practice\u201d). These provisions combine to establish an accurate context within which the \u201cexcept as authorized\u201d proviso of section 401(a) must be construed. And that context indicates an interpretation of the Act that limits a registered physician\u2019s authorization to the dispensation of controlled substances in accordance with currently accepted medical practices. When the conduct of a registrant violates this authorized standard <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>he excludes his acts from the exception of section 401(a) and makes himself subject to its penalties. This interpretation results from a plain reading of the statute and is not based on provisions that are reasonably susceptible to \u201ctwo readings\u201d or dependent on prior decisions interpreting the Harrison Narcotic Act of 1914, 38 Stat. 785.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\">The majority perceptively notices that Dr. Moore has violated section 309 of the Act, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 829,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and that the Act provides that such a violation is punishable under section 402(a)(1), 21 U.S. C. \u00a7 842(a)(1). Having demonstrated their keen sense for the obvious, the majority then conclude that since Congress covered a segment of section 401 offenses under section 402, Dr. Moore must be prosecuted under section 402 because it has less severe penalties. Majority Op. at 427. The majority fail to recognize that a registered physician cannot violate section 401(a) without also necessarily violating sectipn 402(a)(1).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Their reasoning, then, leads to the pat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>ently absurd conclusion that one who commits a lesser included offense cannot be prosecuted for the greater offense because the lesser included offense provides for less severe penalties. In fact that is the basic reasoning of their opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-4\">That ambiguity which the majority professes to find so obvious, however, does not exist in fact. Section 401(a) clearly applies to registered physicians when their conduct is outside the scope of their authorization, while section 402(a)(1) is clearly limited in its application to those \u201c[m]ore or less technical violations\u201d outlined in section 309. H. R.Rep.No.91-1444, 91st Cong., 2d Sess. 10 (1970), U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin. News 1970, p. 4566. Section 309 demonstrably is purely a regulatory provision designed to insure compliance with certain procedural, in contradistinction to substantive, requirements of the Act. Thus the section designates the <em>form </em>of prescriptions issued for various scheduled controlled substances; the more dangerous the drug the more formal the prescription required. Schedule I drugs are excluded from section 309 since by definition they have \u201c[no] currently accepted medical use in treatment\u201d and may not be prescribed. Act \u00a7 202(b) (1) (B), 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 812(b)(1)(B). Schedule II drugs, which have \u201ca currently accepted medical use\u201d but may result in \u201csevere psychological or physical dependence,\u201d <em>id., </em>\u00a7 202(b)(2), 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 812(b)(2), may be dispensed only by a <em>\u201cwritten </em>prescription,\u201d and such prescription may not be refilled. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 309(a), 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 829(a) (emphasis added). Schedule III and IV drugs, which are relatively less dangerous, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 202(b)(3), (4), 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 812(b)(3), (4) , \u201cmay be dispensed <em>without a written or oral </em>prescription in conformity with\u201d the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, and such prescriptions may be refilled. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 309(b), 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 829(b) (emphasis added). Schedule V drugs, relatively the least dangerous, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 202(b)(5), 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 812(b) (5) , are subject only to the requirement of dispensation for a medical purpose. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 309(c), 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 829(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b549-11\">Consistent with this interpretation, the House referred to violations of section 309 punishable under section 402 as \u201c[m]ore or less technical violations.\u201d H.R.Rep.No.91-1444, 91st Cong., 2d Sess. 10 (1970), U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1970, p. 4566. Section 402, moreover, normally contemplates only a civil proceeding to remedy violations of the procedural requirements of section 309. If committed \u201cknowingly,\u201d however, the violation may be prosecuted as a misdemeanor, Act \u00a7 402(c)(2)(A), 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 842(c)(2)(A); <em>id. </em>\u00a7 102(13), 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 802(13); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1 (1970), and repeat offenders may receive up to two years. In contrast to sanctions available under section 402 for procedural irregularities, section 401(a) applies to substantive conduct which exceeds the scope of that authorized by one\u2019s registration and provides for felony prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-12\">To further demonstrate the error of the majority\u2019s approach, assume the following hypothetical situation. Suppose the existence of all the facts proven in this case with the exception that Dr. Moore personally sold and delivered the dolophine pills to the individuals named in the indictment rather than writing prescriptions to be filled at a pharmacy. Since section 309 permits a physician to dispense drugs directly to the ultimate user without a written prescription, Dr. Moore would not have violated section 309 and thus could not be prosecuted under section 402(a)(1). I assume the majority would nevertheless adhere to the position that Dr. Moore \u201cacted wrongfully.\u201d Majority Op. at 429. Assuming all the predicates of the majority opinion as given, then, Moore could not be prosecuted in this situation under either section 401 or 402. Section 402(a)(1) would not be triggered by a violation of section 309, and under the majority\u2019s theory the difference between personal and prescriptive delivery of controlled substances would be meaning<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>less because registrants are not subject to section 401(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b550-4\">The majority\u2019s holding that Dr. Moore can only be prosecuted for a misdemean- or under section 402 rather than for a felony under section 401(a) produces a result not easily susceptible to rational explanation. It is beyond question, I assume, that Congress intended the revocation of registration of any physician who engaged in such palpably unlawful drug pushing as that engaged in by Dr. Moore. Revocation, however, is limited to those situations where a registrant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-5\">(1) has materially falsified any application filed pursuant to or required by this title or title III;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-6\">(2) has, been convicted of a felony under this title or title III or any other law of the United States, or of any State, relating to any substance defined in this title as a controlled substance ; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-7\">(3) has had his State license or registration suspended, revoked, or denied by competent State authority and is no longer authorized by State law to engage in the manufacturing, distribution, or dispensing of controlled substances.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b550-8\">Act, \u00a7 304(a), 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 824(a). There is no evidence that condition (1) has been satisfied. Revocation of Dr. Moore\u2019s registration may not be premised on condition (2) since the majority holds that he may only be prosecuted under the misdemeanor provisions of section 402, rather than under the felony provisions of section 401(a). Nor would it appear that revocation can be premised on condition (3), since D.C.Code \u00a7 2-131 similarly requires conviction of a felony before a physician\u2019s license or registration to practice medicine may be revoked. Thus section 304, premising revocation of registration upon a felony conviction, presuasively suggests that the Congress intended the felony provisions of section 401(a) to be applicable to registrants, such as Dr. Moore, who exceed the scope of conduct authorized by their registration. Otherwise, doctors who trafficked in drugs could never have their registrations revoked.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b550-11\">Moreover, the majority\u2019s decision that no registered physician can be prosecuted under section 401 of the Act is in direct conflict with recent decisions in the First, Fifth, Ninth and Tenth Circuits. In United States v. Bartee, 479 F.2d 484, 488 (10th Cir. 1973) (emphasis in original), the court specifically held that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-12\">when a medical practitioner issues a prescription which is <em>not </em>for a legitimate medical purpose and is <em>not </em>in the usual course of his professional practice,</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b550-13\">he is subject to prosecution under section 401. The court also considered that the cases under the now repealed Harrison Narcotics Act were analogous, as the Government has argued in this case. The Tenth Circuit reaffirmed <em>Bartee </em>in United States v. Jobe, 487 F.2d 268 (10th Cir. 1973). The Fifth Circuit has aligned itself with the Tenth, indicating that a registered physician may be prosecuted under section 401</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-14\">for the unlawful dispensing of a controlled substance, if his prescription is not for a legitimate medical purpose in the usual course of his professional practice ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b550-15\">United States v. Leigh, 487 F.2d 206, 207 (5th Cir. 1973). United States v. Badia, 490 F.2d 296 (1st Cir. 1973) and United States v. Larson, 507 F.2d 385 (9th Cir. 1974) are to the same effect. Thus four circuits have held that a registered physician may be prosecuted under section 401 when he issues prescriptions for controlled substances in an unauthorized manner. I agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>hi</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">The legislative history of the Controlled Substances Act is fairly straightforward and supports the foregoing interpretation. The Act fundamentally revised the penalty structure of the Harrison Narcotic Act of 1914, 38 Stat. 785, by implementing more rational and sophisticated sanctions based upon the nature of particular violations. Under the Harrison Act a violation of <em>any </em>of the Act\u2019s provisions uniformly was punishable by a fine of not more than $2,000 or imprisonment for not more than five years, or both. By contrast, the present Act, passed in 1970, was</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-6\">designed to deal in a comprehensive fashion with the growing menace of drug abuse ... by providing for an overall balanced scheme of criminal penalties for offenses involving drugs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-7\">* -x- * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-8\">The bill revises the entire structure of criminal penalties involving controlled drugs by providing a consistent method of treatment of all persons accused of violations.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b551-9\">H.R.Rep.No.91-1444, 91st Cong., 2d Sess. 1, 4 (1970), U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1970, pp. 4567, 4570. In short, the comprehensive revision was designed to make the penalty fit the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-10\">The House Report indicates that registered physicians were intended to be subject to felony prosecution under section 401(a). On this point, the majority misrepresents the basic thrust of the House Report insofar as it relates to the Prettyman Commission Report by only quoting the Commission\u2019s discussion without noting or analyzing the conclusions drawn from that discussion by the House and by ignoring the specific legislative solution enacted by Congress. The Prettyman Commission focused on the difficulties faced by physicians in determining the conditions under which they lawfully could dispense narcotics in the treatment of addicts. As a result of such difficulties, \u201c[i]n most instances they shun addicts as patients.\u201d The house reacted to this problem not by absolutely immunizing registered physicians from felony prosecution for trafficking in narcotics, as the majority holds, but by joining with the Senate in enacting section 4 of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 257a (1970) (emphasis added):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-13\">The Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare, after consultation with the Attorney General and with national organizations representative of persons with knowledge and experience in the treatment of narcotic addicts, <em>shall determine the appropriate methods of professional practice in the medical treatment of the narcotic addiction </em>of various classes of narcotic addicts, and shall report thereon from time to time to the Congress.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b551-14\">With respect to this legislation the House Report stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-15\">Section 4 of the reported bill provides that the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare, after consultation with national organizations, shall determine appropriate methods of professional practice in the medical treatment of the narcotic addiction of various classes of narcotic addicts, and report thereon from time to time to the Congress. The purpose of this provision is to clarify for the medical profession in the United States the extent to which they may safely go in treating narcotic addicts as patients.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b551-16\">H.R.Rep.No.91-1444, 91st Cong., 2d Sess. 14 (1970), U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1970, p. 4580. Immediately following this paragraph the House Report quotes that portion of the Pretty-man Commission Report cited by the majority and discussed above, and then continues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-17\">The committee expects that the determinations made by the Secretary of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>Health, Education, and Welfare will clarify for the medical profession <em>the conditions under which narcotic drugs may be prescribed for the medical treatment of narcotic addicts. </em>Although the committee is concerned about the appropriateness of having Federal officials determine the appropriate method of the practice of medicine, it is necessary to recognize that for the last 50 years this is precisely what has happened, through criminal prosecution of physicians whose methods of prescribing narcotic drugs have not conformed to the opinions of Federal prosecutors of what constitutes appropriate methods of professional practice. In view of this situation, this section will provide guidelines, determined by the principal health agency of the Federal Government, after consultation with appropriate national professional organizations. Those <em>physicians who comply </em>with the recommendations made by the Secretary will no longer jeopardize their professional careers by accepting narcotic addicts as patients.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b552-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 15, U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1970, p. 4581 (emphasis added). See also H.R.Rep.No. 91-1603, 91st Cong., 2d Sess. 5 (Conference Report) (1970), U. S.Code Cong. <em>&amp; </em>Admin.News 1970, p. 4657. Thus the Congress provided a completely different legislative and administrative solution to the problem than the majority indicates. And it is one in which the manifest intent of the Act is that physicians who comply with the terms of their registration and other applicable regulations are \u201cauthorized\u201d under section 401(a). When they act outside the clearly defined bounds of their registration, they act in an unauthorized manner and are subject to prosecution under section 401(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">Sharply distinguished in the legislative history from the unauthorized drug pushing engaged in by Dr. Moore and punishable under section 401(a), are violations of the regulatory provisions of section 402. A registered physician may be punished under section 402(a)(1) if he violates section 309. Section 309 simply regulates the type and nature of prescriptions required to be issued when dispensing controlled substances. As discussed previously,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> section 309 imposes purely formal requirements \u2014 written, oral or no prescription \u2014 which vary according to the dangerousness of the drug dispensed. Thus, as the House Report states, these \u201c [m] ore or less technical violations . . . are punishable by less severe penalties.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 10, U. S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1970, p. 4576. Indeed, section 402 provides that a violation of its provisions does not constitute a crime, except when committed knowingly, and then a maximum punishment of one year, or two years for repeat offenders, may be imposed. To impose such minor punishment on drug pushers would be completely inconsistent with the maximum punishments authorized by the Act for other violations. For example, under section 403(a), 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 843(a), registrants who distribute controlled substances without using the proper order form can be sentenced to imprisonment for up to four years for an initial violation and up to eight years for a second offense.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <em>Nonetheless, the majority here holds that drug pushing registrants can only be prosecuted under section U02, the principal thrust of which is to impose civil penalties, and misdemeanor punishment not to exceed one year imprisonment for the initial offense or two years for subsequent offenses. </em>Certainly Congress never intended such gross inequality of penalties which would punish lesser offenses more severely than greater offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-9\">Further evidence that the Congress intended section 401(a) to apply to reg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>istered physicians is contained in the Narcotic Addict Treatment Act of 1974 (NATA), Pub.L. No. 93-281 (May 14, 1974), 88 Stat. 124, and its legislative history. NATA amended the Controlled Substances Act to provide greater controls against the illegal diversion of narcotics by unscrupulous physicians, recognizing that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-5\">most methadone diverted for illegal use and sale is derived from one of four major sources: (1) unscrupulous activities of certain individual practitioners ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">H.R.Rep.No.93-884, 93d Cong., 2d Sess. 3 (1974), U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin. News 1974, p. 3031; S.Rep.No.93-192, 93d Cong., 1st Sess. 6 (1973). NATA implemented this objective by requiring a separate, special registration for practitioners engaged in detoxification and maintenance programs and by providing for summary revocation of such registration for failure to comply with specific standards. This special registration was designed to enable the Attorney General immediately to halt illegitimate and dangerous narcotic detoxification and maintenance programs where successful felony prosecution of registered physicians under section 401(a) would be either too difficult or too slow and time-consuming. <em>Id. </em>at 3, 11-15, U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1974, p. 3035.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-8\">Moreover, the Congress continues specifically to contemplate prosecution under section 401(a) of registered physicians who engage in such illegal activities as Dr. Moore. Indeed, the Senate Report on NATA used the case of Dr. Moore as the most egregious example of an unscrupulous physician operating in illicit drug traffic prosecutable under the drug-pushing section of the Controlled Substances Act:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-9\">In some communities, one or more physicians have contributed substantially to the illicit traffic in methadone. Some of these instances involved careless or unscrupulous physicians who were prescribing methadone as a pain killer, while others involved physicians who were operating as pushers under the guise of a detoxification program, for which no special registration was required. One of the most notorious cases is that of Dr. Thomas Moore who operated a \u201cmethadone program\u201d in the District of Columbia until his final conviction of illegal distribution of methadone on an indictment alleging 38 separate counts. Moore operated from his office with impunity for over two years during which time drugs obtained by addicts from him were often found in the illicit traffic and believed to be involved in cases of narcotic overdose deaths.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-13\">* * * * * -x-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-14\">Dr. Moore was eventually found guilty on 22 counts and sentenced to a term of 15 to 45 years and fined $150,000. However, if the Attorney General had had the authority provided in S. 1115, as amended, the BNDD could have moved against this dangerous profiteer far more expeditiously.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b553-15\"><em>Id. </em>at 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-16\">The only concern manifested by the Congress with felony prosecution of doctors under section 401(a) was that it may be too difficult to establish that a physician acted outside \u201cthe course of professional practice,\u201d thereby exceeding the authorization exception of section 401(a). Congress indicated its concern with</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-17\">the present difficulty in such prosecutions because of the intricate and nearly impossible burden of establishing what is beyond \u201cthe course of professional practice\u201d for criminal law purposes when such a practitioner speciously claims that the practices in question were ethical and humanitarian in nature.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>\u2022X- * * -X- * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-4\">As illustrated by the example of Dr. Moore, . . . the Attorney General was unable to take successful criminal action against profiteering practitioners except in the most aggravated of circumstances and then only after prolonged effort to make undercover penetrations.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b554-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 14, 13.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Thus the Congress is completely aware of the prosecution of trafficking physicians as such and it clearly was, and is, Congress\u2019 intent that registered physicians be prosecuted under the felony provisions of section 401(a) when they knowingly or intentionally dispense controlled substances other than in \u201cthe course of professional practice\u201d and in excess of their registration.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-7\">In holding that drug trafficking registrants are absolutely immune from prosecution under the regular drug trafficking section applicable to \u201cany person,\u201d the majority has totally misread the Act and misconstrued the legislative history. I would accordingly hold to the contrary and, having considered all the other points raised by appellant and found them to be without merit, would affirm the convictions on all counts except those in which double sentences were imposed for dispensing to minors without any such allegations being set forth in the indictment. It is my view that the count upon which a sentence is imposed must allege that the victim is a minor if the additional punishment for sale to a minor is sought to be adjudged. As to these counts, I would remand the case for resentencing.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b541-5\">. Tr. at 711-12. Methadone detoxification is a currently accepted medical practice designed to cure a narcotic addict of his addiction. It involves initially a \u201cholding stage\u201d in which the methadone dosage necessary to prevent withdrawal symptoms is determined, after which such dosage is gradually reduced until the patient hopefully reaches a drug-free state. <em>See </em>text as 447-448 <em>infra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">The Controlled Substances Act was recently amended to include a specific definition of detoxification for purposes of the Act:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-7\">The term \u2018detoxification treatment means the dispensing, for a period not in excess of twenty-one days, of a narcotic drug in decreasing doses to an individual in order to alleviate adverse physiological or psychological effects incident to withdrawal from the continuous or sustained use of a narcotic drug and as a method of bringing the individual to a narcotic drug-free state within such period.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b541-8\">Narcotic Addict Treatment Act of 1974 \u00a7 2, Pub.L.

A registered physician necessarily violates the prescription requirements of section 309 when he violates section 401(a). This is true because a prescription is an order of a physician which states the medicine to be used by a patient to treat his particular illness and is the objective manifestation of applied medical skill and experience. In short, it specifies the prescribed remedy for a particular, diagnosed illness and is thus issued for a valid medical purpose. Unless dispensed directly by a practitioner other than a jiharmacist, <em>see </em>text at 451 <em>supra, </em>a Schedule II controlled substance may be dispensed by a practitioner only with a \u201cwritten prescription.\u201d Act \u00a7 309(a), 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 829(a) (1970). A practitioner who dispenses a controlled substance in violation of section 401(a) without a diagnosis and not for the treatment of an illness does so for a non-medical purpose. In so doing he does not \u201cprescribe\u201d the drug as a remedy, even though he may have written words on an order form, and thus also violates section 309(a) by dispensing without a \u201cprescription.\u201d <em>See </em>21 C.F.R. \u00a7 306.04 (1973). Actually, the paper is a fictitious prescription and thus not a valid prescription within the meaning of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-13\">Conversely, a physician may violate section 309 without necessarily being subject to prosecution under section 401(a). That is, a physician who dispenses a controlled substance for a legitimate medical purpose in the course of professional practice but simply fails to comply with the procedural formalities of section 309 could not be prosecuted under section 401(a). For example, if a physician in good faith and for a legitimate medical purpose within the scope of his registration <em>(e. g., </em>detoxification) \u201cknowingly\u201d dispenses methadone by an oral rather than by a written prescription as required under section 309(a), he could only be prosecuted for a misdemeanor under section 402(a)(1), since this procedural infraction is specifically covered by that section. Also, his substantive conduct would be within the scope of his authorization for section 401(a) purposes, but he nevertheless would have acted in a proeedurally irregular manner in violation of section 309(a). This is not, however, the situation before the court today.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b550-9\">. The Narcotic Addict Treatment Act of 1974, Pub.L.No. 93-281 (May 14, 1974), 88 Stat. 124, enlarged the powers of the Attorney General to revoke registrations. <em>See </em>text at 457 <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b552-6\">. <em>See </em>text at 453, <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b552-10\">. <em>See </em>note 8 <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b554-8\">. When the Dr. Moore investigation was finished, there was abundant proof that lie acted outside the course of professional practice. Dr. Moore also admitted that his registration was limited to detoxification (Tr. 711-12).

This refers to the sentences imposed on counts 16, 17, 18, 20, 21, 23, 24 and 25 of 10 to 30 years and $10,000 on each such count, that is, $80,000 total. I would not in any way require the district court to interfere with the consecutive nature of these sentences to the sentences on the other counts, but the court of course would also correct the total sentence in keeping with the ultimate sentences imposed.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
