The district court conducted a two-part suppression hearing and held that the Rule 41(d) violation infected the otherwise valid search, rendering the seized items and their fruits inadmissible in evidence. The government appealed pursuant, to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3731. We vacate the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1058-4\">Appellee is under indictment for possession of an illegal still in violation of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5601(a)(1) and for possession of non tax-paid distilled spirits in violation of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5604(a)(1). On July 20, 1973, Special Agent O\u2019Connell of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms sought and received a warrant to search appellee\u2019s premises, situated near Connellsville, Pennsylvania, for illicit distilling equipment, mash and distilled spirits. Several agents accompanied O\u2019Connell during the July 23, 1973, execution of the warrant, seizing, among other things, a \u201ccopper pot type still\u201d and \u201cillicit distilled spirits.\u201d Agents also took photographs of the site during their search and allegedly witnessed incriminating statements by the appellee. Chemical analysis of the seized liquid was later made.-</p>\n<p id=\"b1058-5\">Upon completion of the search, the original return and a copy were filled out. O\u2019Connell signed the copy, swearing to the accuracy of the inventory, and handed it to appellee.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> It is undisputed that the copy of the return received by appellee was complete.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> However, the original return has never been signed by any agent; nor has it been returned before the issuing magistrate.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Indeed, it was not filed in the office of the Clerk of the District Court until January 17, 1974. Although the district court made no finding as to the reason for this failure to adhere to the proper return procedures, it did receive testimony, which, if credited, explained the reason for this irregularity. Agent Wallington, a participant in the search, testified that O\u2019Connell gave him the unsigned original to take to Pittsburgh, and that he, Wallington, delivered the return, along with others, to the magistrate\u2019s office on or before July 27, 1973. Because the magistrate was not in his office at the time Wallington arrived, and because Wallington was needed at Uniontown, Pennsylvania, he left the original return with the magistrate\u2019s secretary.</p>\n<p id=\"b1058-11\">Appellant does not dispute the district court\u2019s conclusion that Rule 41(d) was violated in this ease. Instead, it mounts an attack on the district court\u2019s imposition of the suppression remedy. Specifically, it argues that a Rule 41(d) viola<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"963\">*963</page-number>tion is not a deprivation of appellee\u2019s Fourth Amendment rights and that the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure do not mandate suppression if appellee receives a complete copy of the return and has failed to demonstrate prejudice from the violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1059-5\">Appellee does not seriously dispute appellant\u2019s Fourth Amendment contention. He concedes that certain failures in the return procedure do not warrant this draconian sanction; but contends that where, as here, there is an utter failure to make the return before the magistrate, both the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure and the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment require suppression. Otherwise, argues appellee, a serious potential for abuse exists, presaging a breakdown of the rul\u00e9s and the protections they afford.</p>\n<p id=\"b1059-6\">Cady v. Dombrowski, 413 U.S. 433, 93 S.Ct. 2523, 37 L.Ed.2d 706 (1973), squarely addressed appellant\u2019s Fourth Amendment contention. There, the Wisconsin police had failed to recite on the search warrant return that a sock and a floor mat had been seized pursuant to a search warrant. At a subsequent hearing the sheriff who had executed the warrant did not state that these two items had been seized. The Court rejected the argument that the defective return rendered the underlying search invalid under the Fourth Amendment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1059-7\">The seizures of the sock and the floor mat occurred while a valid warrant was outstanding, and thus could not be considered unconstitutional .... As these items were constitutionally seized, we do not deem it constitutionally significant that they were not listed in the return of the warrant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A3oz\">413 U.S. at 449, 93 S.Ct. at 2532.</p>\n<p id=\"b1059-8\">Here, the district court specifically found that there was probable cause to search appellee\u2019s premises.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> At the time of this seizure, appellee\u2019s rights under the Fourth Amendment were not being infringed. The irregularity occurred only after a valid search and seizure. We hold that, under the facts of this case, such irregularity is not \u201cconstitutionally significant\u201d under the Fourth Amendment.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Therefore, the ramification of this procedural violation is a matter of federal law governed, in this case, by the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b1059-12\">The procedural requirements of Rule 41(d) are essentially ministerial in nature. United States v. Harrington, 504 F.2d 130 (7th Cir., 1974); United States v. Kennedy, 457 F.2d 63, 67 (10th Cir.), cert. denied, 409 U.S. 864, 93 S.Ct. 157, 34 L.Ed.2d 112 (1972); United States v. Wilson, 451 F.2d 209, 214 (5th Cir. 1971), cert. denied, 405 U.S. 1032, 92 S.Ct. 1298, 31 L.Ed.2d 490 (1972); United States v. McKenzie, 446 F.2d 949, 954 (6th Cir. 1971). The rule commands the officer to perform specific acts \u2014 to leave a copy of the warrant, to issue a receipt for property taken, to make a return and to prepare a written inventory in the presence of certain persons. While the rule outlines detailed procedures, it does not expressly address the remedies, if any, which flow from a failure to adhere to those procedures. Therefore, we turn to Rule 2, F.R.Cr.P. as our interpretive polestar. Rule 2 expresses values sought to be achieved by the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. We are commanded to give the rules a construction which secures \u201csimplicity in procedure, fairness in administration and the elimination of unjustifiable expense and delay.\u201d The manifest intent of the rules is to ensure a just determination of every criminal proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b1060-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"964\">*964</page-number>Applying these precepts to the issue before us, we do not believe that it was intended that every violation of the procedures in the rule, however insignificant and however lacking in consequences, should give rise to the remedy of suppression. If such had been the intent, we think the rules would have specifically so provided. At the same time, we do not believe that Congress would enact Rule 41(d), expressly requiring certain actions on the part of the government, and not also intend some remedy to flow from certain violations of that rule. Therefore, we conclude, along with the Sixth<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and Tenth<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Circuits, that a motion to suppress, Rule 41(f), F.R.Cr.P.,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> should be granted by the district court only when the defendant demonstrates prejudice from the Rule 41(d) violation. We believe that this interpretation furthers the governing intent of the rules \u2014 a just determination of every criminal proceeding \u2014 and that the wholesale opportunity for abuse appellee fears simply will not materialize. The suppression remedy remains viable where a sufficient showing of prejudice is made, that is, prejudice in the sense that it offends concepts of fundamental fairness or due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b1060-4\">Here it is undisputed that appellee timely received a copy of the return and that it accurately listed each item seized by the agents. Because appellee has failed to demonstrate that he was prejudiced by the Rule 41(d) violation in this case, we hold that it was error for the district court to suppress the seized items and their fruits.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1060-5\">The judgment of the district court will be vacated, and the proceedings will be remanded in accordance with the foregoing.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1057-15\">. <em>(d) Execution and Return unth Inventory. </em>The officer taking property under the warrant shall give to the person from whom or from whose premises the property was taken a copy of the warrant and a receipt for the property taken or shall leave the copy and receipt at the place from which the property was taken.

We likewise reject appellee\u2019s Fifth Amendment due process argument. Assuming that the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment is applicable to Rule 41(d) violations and that the suppression remedy is applicable to such a deprivation, the undisputed facts of this case do not rise to such a deprivation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1060-6\">.
