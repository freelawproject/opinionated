We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b1385-7\">Schedule 7, Part 5, covers, among other things, Games and Toys. Subpart E provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1385-9\">\n<em>Subpart E headnates:</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1385-10\">1. The articles described in the provisions of this subpart (except parts) shall be classified in such provisions, whether or not such articles are more specifically provided for elsewhere in the tariff schedules, but the provisions of this subpart do not apply to\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1385-11\">*x- -jf <em>&amp; </em>\u25a0$\u00a3 -X\u2019 \u25a0x* \u2022x*</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1385-12\">(iii) games and other articles in items 734.15 and 734.20, toy balls (items 735.09-.12), and puzzles and games in item 735.20 (see part 5D of this schedule).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1385-13\">2. For the purposes of the tariff schedules, a \u201ctoy\u201d is any article chiefly used for the amusement of children or adults.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1385-14\">* -X* -X- * * 'X- -X*</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1385-15\">Toys, and parts of toys, not specifically provided for:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1385-16\">-X- * -X- * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1385-17\">737.90 Other ................................ 35% ad val.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1385-18\">Subpart D provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1385-19\">734.15 Chess, checkers, pachisi, backgammon, darts, and other games played on boards of special design, all the foregoing games and parts thereof (including their boards); mahjong, and dominoes; any of the foregoing games in combination with each other, or with other games, packaged together as a unit in immediate containers of a type used in retail sales; poker chips and dice................. 20% ad val.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1385-22\">734.20 Game machines, including coin or disc operated game machines and including games having mechanical controls for manipulating the action, and parts thereof ................................. 11.5% ad val.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1385-25\">*******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1385-26\">735.20 Puzzles; game, sport, gymnastic, athletic, or playground equipment; all the foregoing, and parts thereof, not specifically provided for ........................ 20% ad val.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1386-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1290\">*1290</page-number>The merchandise is a miniature pinball article consisting of a tilted cardboard base, resting on two short pegs, and clear plastic sides and upper surface, and is approximately %\" x 14\" x 8\" in size. The cardboard surface depicts a spaceship-planet or baseball motif. Six small plastic balls are provided, which can be projected by a manually-operated spring mechanism or trigger into nine slots (numbered 400, 500, 600, 750, 800, 900, 1000, 1200, and 2000) or behind various barriers on the cardboard surface. It is designed for use by children from ages six to twelve.</p>\n<p id=\"b1386-4\">The Customs Court, in dismissing the action, concluded as a matter of law that appellant had failed to establish, prima facie, that the imported merchandise was chiefly used as a game and had failed to overcome the presumption that it was chiefly used for the amusement of children or adults and was, therefore, properly classified as a toy under item 737.90.</p>\n<p id=\"b1386-5\">As a general rule, the plaintiff in a customs classification case has a dual burden of showing that the classification by the Customs Service was incorrect and that the plaintiff\u2019s proposed classification is correct. Morris Friedman v. United States, 50 CCPA 53, 56, C.A.D. 819 (1963). According to this rule, if the record supported appellant\u2019s contention that the merchandise was not chiefly used for the amusement of children or adults and was, therefore, not a toy, the record would also have to support classification under item 734.20, 734.15, or 735.20 for appellant to prevail ; and appellant could prevail by showing that the merchandise was chiefly used as a game, which would rebut the presumption of correctness that it was chiefly used for amusement of children or adults and was, therefore, a toy.</p>\n<p id=\"b1386-9\">However, we do not believe the conclusions of the Customs Court or appellee\u2019s arguments correctly state appellant\u2019s burden. The Subpart E headnotes provide that games and other articles in 734.15 and 734.20 and puzzles and games in item 735.20 are <em>excepted </em>from the requirement of classification under Sub-part E even though they are described in the provisions of Subpart E (e. g. \u201cToys\u201d). Therefore, we conclude that appellant\u2019s burden is to show (not necessarily by chief use) that its merchandise is described in one or more of items 734.15, 734.20, or 735.20, and in which one of them it is most specifically described. See Broderick &amp; Bascom Rope Co. v. United States, 59 CCPA 130, C.A.D. 1053, 460 F.2d 1070 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b1386-10\">In our determination of whether appellant has sustained this burden, we direct our attention to the description in item 734.20, \u201cgames having mechanical controls for manipulating the action,\u201d because an examination of the article (importer\u2019s exhibits 1 and 2) and the testimony of record leave no question that the article has a mechanical control (manually operated spring mechanism) for manipulating the action.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Appellee argues that the phrasing of item 734.20, \u201c[g]ame machines, including coin or disc operated game machines and including games having mechanical controls for manipulating the action,\u201d requires that appellant\u2019s article be a \u201cmachine.\u201d However, the legislative intent<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> derived from the Tariff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1291\">*1291</page-number>Classification Study (1960) and the First Supplemental Report thereto (January, 1962) clearly was otherwise. The Study (Subpart D, Part 5 of Schedule 7) proposed the following provision for item 734.20 (p. 264):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1387-5\">Game machines, including coin or disc operated game machines and parts thereof</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1387-6\">The First Supplemental Report recommended the following insertion before \u201c, and parts thereof\u201d (p. 80):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1387-7\">and including games having mechanical controls for manipulating the action</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1387-8\">The following comments accompanied this recommendation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1387-9\">The proposed change in the definition of \u201ctoy\u201d might cause a significant change in the existing treatment of certain hockey games imported in substantial volume from Canada. These games have simple, mechanical controls for manipulating the hockey players, but might not be regarded as a game \u201cmachine\u201d. The foregoing change in item 734.20, together with the change in headnote 1 of part 5E [to except games and other articles in items 734.15 and 734.20] will insure that the existing treatment of these games will be substantially continued.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1387-10\">The key question is whether appellant\u2019s merchandise is a \u201cgame,\u201d regardless of whether it is also a toy.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Both parties agree that the common meaning of \u201cgame\u201d should be followed. Both cite various dictionary definitions which indicate that a \u201cgame\u201d must be competitive or involve a contest, and must possess an element of skill, chance, or endurance.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1387-15\">Although the only witness was the director of creative projects for appellant, his unrebutted testimony and an examination of the article clearly show that the objective is to get the balls into the highest numbered slots to make the highest score, so that the element of contest is present. The manual operation of the spring mechanism to trigger the balls gives the article an element of skill, and the barriers provide an element of chance. As the Customs Court said in Montgomery Ward &amp; Co. v. United States, 66 Cust.Ct. 233, 238, C.D. 4195 (1971):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1387-16\">Of course, a game is necessarily a contest, but one which may be between two or more persons, or between one person and the game itself. For example, a slot machine can only be played by one person at a time . . . . A pinball machine can only be played by one person at a time and is a contest between man and machine which involves an element of skill, while the slot machine is essentially a game of chance. Darts can be played or practiced by one person alone simply as a test of skill of the player, with no necessity for an opposing player. All the above are \u201cgames\u201d or \u201cgame machines\u201d within the provisions for \u201cgames and sporting goods\u201d in schedule 7, part 5, subpart D of the tariff schedules, and do not necessarily involve more than one person in their playing. The point is that these activities are games since they result <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1292\">*1292</page-number>in a \u201cscore\u201d measuring one\u2019s skill or luck or combination thereof against a given set of rules.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1388-4\">With respect to the construction of appellant\u2019s merchandise, the witness testified that the plastic cover, cups, and pegs are made of high-impact styrene\u2014 \u201cjust about the strongest plastic\u201d; that the board is \u201cnot of an extremely good grade but fairly strong.\u201d Additionally, an examination of the article confirms that it is reasonably sturdy and is not of \u201cflimsy\u201d construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1388-5\">Appellee points out that the article was not accompanied by any instructions or rules for play, but it seems obvious that the contest would be to make the highest score with the six balls; moreover, no instructions would be needed for operating the spring mechanism. By its very design and construction, the article is directed to a contest or competition.</p>\n<p id=\"b1388-6\">Appellee argues that the fact that the article has numbers which might be added to achieve a score, or, a score higher than one\u2019s opponent, \u201cmeans nothing to a five to twelve year old who is unable to total a combination of four, three, and one digit numbers,\u201d and suggests that judicial notice be taken of \u201cthe fact that the average child, at least until age 11, cannot add up a combination of four, three and one digit numbers, with or without the aid of paper and pencil or pen.\u201d However, the court is inclined to take judicial notice that such average child <em>can </em>do so. Even if we were to adopt appellee\u2019s suggestion, however, such child would learn which slots were more important and would engage in a contest or competition on that basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b1388-7\">Appellee also argues that appellant\u2019s witness was unable to recollect how he observed the merchandise being used during the relevant period. On the contrary, appellant\u2019s witness declared that he had seen the article being used \u201cliterally hundreds of times,\u201d and further testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1388-12\">Q. Will you please explain how the article was being used in accordance with your observations and your sales experience ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1388-13\">A. As a contest; a game of skill. Two people play it or one person plays it to see how good he is at it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1388-14\">Q. Where is it used, according to your knowledge and observations?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1388-15\">A. I\u2019ve seen it used in homes; I\u2019ve seen it used in front yards and on stoops; I\u2019ve seen it used in our showroom, of course; and I've seen it used in stores.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1388-16\">Appellee further argues that the record shows that appellant failed to prove that the merchandise was chiefly used as a game, citing General interpretative rule 10(e)(i).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> However, items 734.15, 734.20, and 735.20 are not \u201cchief use\u201d provisions. The comments on Sub-part D, Part 5 of Schedule 7, in the Tariff Classification Study (1960) include the following (Schedule 7, pp. 287-288):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1388-17\">The classification problems connected with sports equipment and <em>games </em>and game equipment which may be <em>chiefly used for the amusement of children </em>are particularly troublesome. . Such equipment may be diminutive in size for use by children, such as a boy\u2019s baseball glove, but it would nevertheless be classified under these provisions so long as it was of a character <em>suitable for use </em>in organized play of these games. [Emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1389-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1293\">*1293</page-number>Thus, even though an article may be \u201cchiefly used\u201d for amusement of children, it is nevertheless to be classified under Subpart D if it is a \u201cgame.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1389-4\">It is noteworthy that the Fifth Supplemental Report (1963) to the Tariff Classification Study (1960) recommended amendment of Subpart E headnotes to add puzzles and games in item 735.20, with the following comment (p. 53):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AC86\">Explanation: This change is for clarification to fully reflect the intention that games provided for in item 735.-20 are not to be included in the provisions for toys.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1389-5\">In view of the foregoing and on the basis of the record before us, we hold that appellant has established a prima facie case that its merchandise is a game having a mechanical control for manipulating the action and, as such, is more specifically described in item 734.-20, TSUS.</p>\n<p id=\"b1389-6\">The judgment is reversed. However, inasmuch as the judgment was rendered on appellee\u2019s motion prior to presenting its case, the cause is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1389-7\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1385-27\">.

On the basis of the record, we agree with appellee that the merchandise is not a game played on a board of special design under item 734.15 under the doctrine of <em>ejusdem generis, </em>considering the <em>eo nomine </em>designations of chess, checkers, pachisi, backgammon, and darts. And the Tariff Classification Study (1960) states (Schedule 7, p. 287) that item 735.20 is a \u201cbasket\u201d provision which covers games, puzzles, and sport equipment \u201cnot specially provided for elsewhere in the schedules.\u201d As our discussion discloses, we are satisfied that appellant\u2019s merchandise is specially provided for under item 734.20.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1386-12\">.
