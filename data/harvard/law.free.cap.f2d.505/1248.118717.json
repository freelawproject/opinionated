The purchaser failed to file a counteraffidavit, but orally asserted in the district court that unresolved questions of fact existed. (The only possible question of fact was whether or not a disclaimer of warranty appearing in the purchase order had been \u201cbargained for\u201d within the meaning of Washington law.) A legal memorandum handed to the court in opposition to the summary judgment also purported to tender factual questions, but did not constitute an affidavit or other evidence within the meaning of Rule 56(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b1345-7\">On this record, there was no error. Legal memoranda and oral argument, in the summary-judgment context, are not evidence, and do not create issues of fact capable of defeating an otherwise valid motion for summary judgment. James v. The H.M.S. Port Lyttleton Port Line Limited, 51 F.R.D. 216, 218 (E.D.Pa.1971). Further, any allegations fact contained in appellant\u2019s complaint do not create an issue against a motion for summary judgment supported by affidavit. First National Bank v. Cities Service Co., 391 U.S. 253, 289, 88 S.Ct. 1575, 20 L.Ed.2d 569 (1968); Chapman v. Rudd Paint &amp; Varnish Co., 409 F.2d 635, 643 (9th Cir. 1969); C. Wright, Federal Courts \u00a7 99, at 444 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b1345-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
