There was a total failure to prove this allegation. The plaintiff himself, when called to tell how the accident occurred, testified that while he was on the first step of the front platform, in the act of getting on the car, which was standing still, the driver thereof pushed him in his breast with his hand off the car against the wall. This testimony was admissible as a part of the transaction resulting in the accident complained of, and also for the purpose of negativing the cause of action alleged. The cause of action alleged was one for negligence of the driver; the one proved was for an assault upon a passenger by the driver. This point was raised by defendant\u2019s request to charge that, unless the plaintiff was thrown from the car by reason of its being started suddenly, as alleged in the complaint, he cannot recover. This request was refused 'and defendant excepted. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>After the jury had retired the court allowed the complaint to he amended by setting up the cause of action for the assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-4\">The question for our consideration is not whether such amendment can be made at Special Term on notice, but whether it can be made <em>at the trial </em>of the case. There was a total failure in its entire scope to prove the cause of action alleged. Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7 531. The court, upon the trial, is not authorized to allow an amendment which substantially changes the claim or defense (id. \u00a7 723), and the amendment was not only a substantial change of the claim, but was the substitution of another cause of action for the one pleaded, and that is forbidden by the law at the trial, notwithstanding the broad discretion confided to courts in the matter of liberal amendments.
