The New Jersey Steamboat Co., Respondent.</parties>\n<court data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"court\" id=\"b188-4\">(New York Common Pleas</court>\n<p data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"misc\" id=\"AL8\">General Term,</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"Agn\">November, 1894.)</decisiondate>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b188-5\">Plaintiff shipped certain bales of hops by the defendant\u2019s line, which, upon arrival in New York, were lightered to a dock, and the consignee was notified of their arrival. He replied that they would be removed during the day, but only one load was taken, and late in the afternoon he sent word that no more would be taken that day. The captain of the lighter then covered the bales with tarpaulins to protect them, but, in consequence of a heavy storm during the night, the hops were damaged, and the consignee refused to receive the balance. <em>Held, </em>that the space of one day afforded a reasonable time for the removal of the bales, and that there was a constructive delivery sufficient to relieve defendant of liability as carrier; that under the circumstances it was not required to store the goods, and having used the usual means of protection, was not liable as warehouseman.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b188-6\">Appeal from a judgment entered upon the report of a referee. \u2022 '</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b188-7\">Action for injuries to goods when in the defendant\u2019s custody under contract for carriage.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b188-8\">The plaintiff shipped sixty-three bales of hops by the defendant\u2019s steamboat from Albany, consigned to the Claus Lipsius Brewing Company in Williamsburgh, under a verbal contract of affreightment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b188-9\">The goods were lightered by the defendant upon their arrival in New York, and were transported to a dock within one mile of the consignee\u2019s place of residence, the lighter reaching the dock at eight-thirty in the morning of July 19, 1889. The consignee was notified of the arrival of the goods and a reply was received that removal of the hops would be made early in the morning of the above date. By nine o\u2019clock that morning a dray arrived from the consignee\u2019s brewery and took on a load of seventeen bales, delivering the same at the brewery by ten o\u2019clock, but no other wagons from the consignee arrived at the dock that day. At' one o\u2019clock the captain of the lighter telephoned to the brewery with regard to the delivery of the remaining bales, and was told that they would be sent for during the day; at five he telephoned again <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>and received word that no more hops would be taken that day. .Thereupon the bales were covered with tarpaulins, in the manner followed by lightermen, and remained on board during: the. night. Before morning a particularly heavy rain storm-t.ook place and damage to the goods occurred, resulting in their refusal by the consignee and a consequent loss to the\" plaintiff. It appeared that an order had been given by the consignee to its servants to send three drays for the purpose of unloading these goods, and that a number of drays sufficient for the carrying out of the order could have been made available; also, that three loads would have sufficed for the transportation of the. entire consignment. The evidence tended to show that this transportation was not made owing to the opinion of the consignee\u2019s servants that the weather was threatening, and the testimony as to the state of the weather during the day presented a conflict.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b189-4\">The referee rendered judgment in favor of the defendant for dismissal of the complaint upon the merits.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b189-5\"><em>William O. </em>Ccvnvpbell, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b189-6\"><em>W. P. </em>Prentice, for respondent.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b189-7\">Bischokf, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AnQ\">No claim is made that the goods in suit were injured while in the course of actual transportation by the defendant carrier, and the only question raised by the appellant relates to the defendant\u2019s liability for the damage occurring, under the state of facts above recited, either in the capacity of carrier or of warehouseman.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-8\">It is well settled that a carrier of goods retains its character as such, with the attendant liability as insurer, until the goods have been delivered to the consignee either actually or constructively, and that to constitute a constructive delivery there must be notice of arrival and the affording of a reasonable time for the removal of the goods by the consignee. After this reasonable time has elapsed, and the carrier should fail to divest itself of all liability by storing the goods for the consignor, as it may, a liability as warehouseman attaches, and an. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>absence of ordinary and reasonable care of the goods must be shown,fin order that a liability for their injury may be imposed. <em>Tarbell </em>v. <em>Royal Exchange Shipping Co., </em>110 N. Y. 180 <em>; McKinney </em>v. <em>Jewett, </em>90 id. 271 ; <em>Redmond </em>v. <em>Liverpool, etc., Co., </em>46 id. 578 ; <em>McAndrew </em>v. <em>Whitlock, </em>52 id. 40 ; <em>Fenner </em>v. <em>R. R. Co., </em>44 id. 505 ; <em>Draper v. Prest., etc., D. &amp; H. C. Co., </em>118 id. 118. The circumstances of the particular case must control in determining the extent of this reasonable time <em>(McAndrew </em>v. <em>Whitlock, </em>52 N. Y. 40), and, in this connection, the consignee\u2019s obligation to exercise due diligence in removing the goods is a material element of consideration. <em>Tarbell </em>v. <em>R. E. S. Co., </em>110 N. Y. 180.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-4\">As to the defendant\u2019s liability as carrier, then, the case turns upon the question whether or not the space of one day afforded a reasonable time for the unloading of the hops in suit, and, in view of the circumstances of the case, we agree with the learned referee that this was such a reasonable time.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">There was no provision for <em>\u201c </em>lay days \u201d in the contract of carriage, and the consignee, at intervals during the day of the lighter\u2019s arrival, expressed his intention of removing the goods before night, which removal, by the means contemplated, could readily have been accomplished in a short space of time, and it appears from the evidence, considering the perishable nature of the goods, that the carrying out of its expressed intention by the consignee would have been but the performance of its duty to the carrier as imposed by law There is ample evidence to support the referee\u2019s finding that upon this particular day the state of the weather reasonably admitted of the safe transportation by the consignee of the goods, notwithstanding the conflict upon this point, and the defendant is in no way to be held accountable for errors of judgment on the part of the consignee\u2019s servants with regard to the expediency of carting the hops during the period in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">Not being liable as carrier for the injury which occurred to the goods, is the defendant chargeable with negligence in caring for them as warehouseman ?</p>\n<p id=\"b190-7\">That the defendant\u2019s agent, the captain of the lighter, exer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>cised reasonable care in covering the hops for the night cannot, we think, be seriously disputed, and, indeed, the appellant\u2019s argument upon this point is confined to the proposition that it was the defendant\u2019s duty to place the goods in storage for their proper protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">It is not contradicted that the captain carefully employed the usual means provided for protecting goods upon a lighter, nor that these means, under ordinary circumstances, would suffice for their purposes, and in view of the repeated expressions by the consignee of its intention to remove the goods that day, together with its failure to give notice of its change of intention until the end of the day, it cannot be questioned that the placing of the goods in storage over night would have been an act of extraordinary diligence not required of the defendant. The duties of the parties were correlative (Tar<em>bell </em>v. <em>R. E. S. Co., </em>110 N. Y. 180), and those of the defendant were not to be increased by the consignee\u2019s failure to observe those on its part to be performed. <em>Button </em>v. <em>R. R. Co., </em>18 N. Y. 256.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">The appellant raises no points which require a further discussion, and we are well content to affirm the judgment, \"whereby the respondent appears to have obtained but justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-7\">The judgment should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-8\">Bookstaveb and Pbyob, JJ., concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-9\">Judgment affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
