Proc. \u00a7 3165. The provision, being for acquisition of jurisdiction, must be strictly complied with.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-6\">Manifestly the order fails to conform to the mandate of the Code, 'in that it omits to specify the exact time, less than six days, within which the defendants were to answer. The requirement of the order is merely that the summons shall cite the defendants to answer within a period <em>\u201c </em>not less than two days; \u201d but whether they are to answer on the third, fourth, fifth or sixth day after service of summons is not specified in the order. The order leaves with the plaintiffs the privilege of designating the time within which the defendants shall answer, with the restriction only that they be summoned to answer within \u201c hot less than two days.\u201d Accordingly, the the plaintiffs summoned the defendants to answer \u201cwithin two days.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b723-7\">But the Code prescribes that the court shall specify the shorter time (than six days) within which the defendants should be summoned to answer. The order was the only authority for the issuance of the summons; and as the order failed to define the period, within which the defendants were to answer, the conclusion is that the plaintiffs were powerless to supply the omission.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>Clearly, the summons does-not \u201c correspond with the order,\u201d for the one does, and. the other does not, limit the time for answering.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">It is not to be argued that the objection urged by the appellants is merely technical. Legal procedure is a system of technicalities, the observance of which, especially upon points of jurisdiction, is indispensable to the orderly administration of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-6\">Order reversed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-7\">Daly, Ch. J., and Bischoff, J., concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-8\">Order reversed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
