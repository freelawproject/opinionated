Casey, 41 N. Y. St., Repr. 339 ; <em>Porter </em>v. McGrath, 41 N. Y. Super. Ct. 84.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-8\">The finding that the value of the premises in the year 1873 was \u201c about $15,000,\u201d the exact words of defendants\u2019 expert, is not in conflict with the evidence that the precise sum paid as consideration for the sale of the property at that time was $15,250, which would seem to have been the basis upon which the court\u2019s computation was founded. Upon this basis the award of fee damage of $1,400 finds support and in no way is in conflict with the other findings made.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>The evidence shows that the value of the land at the period considered could be \u2022 taken as $8,000, leaving the sum of $7,250 to represent the value of the building. Deducting from this last sum the decrease in value by reason of .wear and tear, as shown to be $1,500, and allowing fifty per cent for increase of land values, we have the following result:</p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\">Original value of property (1873)........ $15,250</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">Value of land (1873)................... 8,000</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">Value of building (1873)................ 7,250</p>\n<p id=\"b196-7\">Building with deduction........................ $5,750</p>\n<p id=\"b196-8\">Value of land and increase...................... 12,000</p>\n<p id=\"b196-9\">Normal value. ............................ $17,750</p>\n<p id=\"b196-10\">Present value .............................. 16,125</p>\n<p id=\"b196-11\">Decrease ................................. $1,625</p>\n<p id=\"b196-12\">which sum, less a reasonable deduction for benefits, as found generally by the court, would justify the finding as to damage which was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-13\">The judgment should he affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-14\">Daly, Ch. J., and Pryor, J., concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-15\">Judgment affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
