Taylor, his wife, was Louise <em>&amp; Go. </em>in New York, and he was vice-president of Louise <em>&amp; Go. </em>of Chicago. He produced certain checks, which he claimed represented the amounts of the vouchers, and by which they had been paid. He sought to show by the cashier of Louise <em>&amp; </em>Co. of New York that plaintiff, when she left their employ, had taken with her certain vouchers which had been given by defendant to Louise <em>&amp; Go. </em>for cash. The question asked was excluded, and inasmuch as the testimony is very conflicting, and the line of inquiry sought to be introduced by this excluded question would probably have shown light upon an obscure and conflicting state of facts, we think that the justice erred in excluding the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>The judgment should, therefore, be reversed and a new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-4\">Bisohoff, J., concurs.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-5\">Judgment reversed and new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide event.
