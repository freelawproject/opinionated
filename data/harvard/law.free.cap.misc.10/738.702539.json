Such a statement in the order, where the amount of the matter in controversy, as in this case, does not exceed $500, is required in order to authorize an appeal to the Court of .Appeals. Laws of 1874, chap. 322; <em>Squire </em>v. <em>McDonald, </em>138 N. Y. 554 <em>; Bastable </em>v. <em>City of Syracuse, </em>72 id. 64. The application for the amendment is opposed on the ground that we have no jurisdiction to make the amendment, and <em>De Freest </em>v. <em>City of Troy, </em>34 Hun, 580 ; 101 N. Y. 608, is cited as authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-14\">The last-named case holds that the power to allow an appeal to the Court of Appeals can only be exercised by the General Term which, rendered the decision, or by the next General Term held after judgment thereon has been entered. The cas\u00e9 has no bearing upon the question of amending an order .whereby permission to appeal .to the Court of Appeals was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>heretofore and seasonably granted. The court possesses unrestricted power at all times to make the record declare the truth as to its judgment. <em>National Bank </em>v. <em>N. Y. Bank, </em>97 N. Y. 645. In that ease it was held that the General Term had power to amend its order after an appeal had been taken therefrom to the Court of Appeals by adding a statement that the reversal was upon the facts as well as the law, although the effect was to give the respondent a better position in the Court of Appeals; following <em>Guernsey </em>v. Miller, 80 N. Y. 181, and <em>Buckingham </em>v. <em>Dickinson, </em>54 id. 682. If the decision appealed from could be amended after appeal, the decision upon the application for leave to appeal is equally amendable. The amendment allowed in the cases cited is more radical than that which is now applied for, and the decisions amply justify the relief asked. 1</p>\n<p id=\"b799-5\">Motion granted, without costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-6\">Bischoff and Pryor, JJ., concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-7\">Motion granted, without costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
