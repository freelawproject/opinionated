Jones, Respondent, <em>v. </em>Jacob Wick, Jr., Appellant.</parties>\n<court data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"court\" id=\"b172-5\">(New York Common Pleas</court>\n<p data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"misc\" id=\"ACI\">General Term,</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"ADP\">November, 1894.)</decisiondate>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b172-6\">A contract for the excavation of land which makes no provision for the disposition of the soil remdved does not, as matter of law,. imply a transfer of title to materials of value removed in the performance of its requirements. Whether the title thereto may be held to have passed by abandonment in any case depends upon the fact of an intent to so abandon on the part of the original owner.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b172-7\">In an action upon a contract for excavating land and furnishing sand and stone for the building to be erected thereon, the defendant counterclaimed for the value of sand for which he had been charged and which he claimed had been taken from the land in excavating. The referee refused to admit evidence in support of the counterclaim, holding that it was immaterial and that defendant could not counterclaim for the value of sand taken out within the limits of the contract. <em>Meld, </em>that in the absence of proof of an intent on defendant\u2019s part to abandon the title to the sand, or of a custom governing such contracts, such ruling was erroneous.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b172-8\">Appeal from a judgment entered upon the report of a referee.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b172-9\"><em>Dcmiel Daly, </em>for respondent.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b172-10\"><em>Albert Zimmermarm, </em>for appellant.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b172-11\">Bisohoff, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ASF\">To an action upon a contract for the excavation of a certain area of ground, and for the supplying of sand and stone to be used in the building erected upon the land so excavated, the defendant set up a counterclaim for the value of the sand for which he had been- charged by the plaintiff in the course of their transactions, and which, it was claimed, had been taken from the former\u2019s ground as a part of the. soil excavated.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-12\">Although some evidence was given by which it was sought to prove a custom governing such contracts as that in suit, the rulings of the referee, both before and after this testimony was adduced, upon questions calculated to show that the building sand supplied and charged for by the plaintiff came from the defendant\u2019s soil, proceeded upon a strict assumption that the title to all material excavated passed to the plaintiff, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>and that no claim for its value, or for any recovery of the amount paid to the plaintiff therefor, could be entertained, and the question thus raised is amply presented by the exceptions taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">The evidence of custom alluded to was given solely by the witness Q-ent, and is of no value in support of these rulings or of the final determination, since it is found to be so inconsistent with itself and so directly contradictory as to be unintelligible in any aspect. Such is the character of this testimony that that part of-it which appears within the same folio in the printed case is relied upon, and with reason, by the respective parties in support of their contentions as to facts which are in hopeless opposition. At best, however, this testimony tends merely to show that under certain accepted conditions contracts are differently made with regard to such matters as those in suit, and fails to establish any usage in this regard. Moreover, it appears that the evidence noted did not enter into the considerations of the learned referee, even if any weight were to be accorded it, for the position taken by him in ruling upon evidence offered by the defendant in support of the counterclaim is defined in the following language: \u201cYou can raise your questions of law by a series of questions on the sand, but I shall hold it immaterial; that you cannot recover for any sand that he took out. I shall hold as a general proposition that the defendant cannot counterclaim for the value of any sand taken out by the plaintiff within the limits of his contract.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">In so far as it touches this subject, .the contract, as shown by the evidence, was simply for making excavations upon the defendant\u2019s land, and no provision for the disposal of the soil removed in the course of the work was shown to have been made.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-7\">We are unable to agree with the learned referee that the. contract to excavate implied a transfer of title to materials of value removed in the performance of its requirements, as a matter of law, for this would involve a determination that, under the agreement proven, an abandonment to the plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>\u2022of these materials had resulted, and as a matter strictly of law it- cannot be held that such was the result upon the record before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">The question whether or not title may be held to have passed by abandonment, in any case, turns fundamentally upon the fact of an intent to so abandon upon the part of the original owner (<em>Wyman </em>v. <em>Hurlburt, </em>40 Am. Dec. 464, note and cases cited ; <em>Lacustrine, etc., Co, </em>v. <em>Lake Guano, etc., Co., </em>82 N. Y. 476), and this question becomes one of law only where the evidence with regard to such fact is conclusive. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">The rulings of the referee in the case at bar concluded the question of title against the defendant, and this, in the absence of any evidence as to an intent on his part to abandon the chattels in question to the plaintiff, and upon the assumption that further proof was immaterial. This evidence might, indeed, have been furnished by proof of some established custom of trade in the light of which the contract 'in suit could have been construed <em>(Marine Nat. Bank </em>v. <em>Nat. City Bank, </em>59 N. Y. 67 ; 17 Am. Rep. 305 ; <em>Eager </em>v. <em>Ins. Co., </em>14 Pick. 141 ; 25 Am. Dec. 363 ; <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Hamilton, </em>12 Pick. 425 ; 23 Am. Dec. 619 ; <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Baker, </em>11 Metc. 186 ; 45 Am. Dec. 199 ; <em>South Western, etc., Co. </em>v. <em>Stanard, </em>44 Mo. 71 ; 100 Am. Dec. 255 ; <em>Farnsworth </em>v. <em>Chase, </em>19 N. H. 534 ; 51 Am. Dec. 206 ; <em>Sampson </em>v. <em>Gazzam, </em>6 Porter, 123 ; 30 Am. Dec. 578), but standing alone as it does, the agreement shown by the evidence fails to afford that proof which is essential to any support of the rulings made.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-7\">The question raised as to the plaintiff\u2019s second cause of action does not call for special consideration, since for the error noted a reversal of the entire judgment must result. <em>Canavan </em>v. <em>Stuyvesant, </em>7 Misc. Rep. 113.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-8\">Judgment reversed, reference discharged and new trial ordered, with costs to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-9\">Bookstaveb and Pbyoe, JJ., concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-10\">Judgment reversed, reference discharged and new trial ordered, with costs to abide event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
