Two visits made by the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>upon the real estate agents, Birdsall &amp; Co., appear, at first sight, like admissions that the defendant regarded himself as a tenant of the premises in question. Upon his first visit, he requested these agents, who, as the plaintiff\u2019s manager had told him, were the ones usually employed by the plaintiff, to-find a tenant for a part of the loft; but the defendant explains this by saying that he wanted to find whether a part of the loft could be let before he engaged to take it all, as it was more than he needed. When he called the second time, he directed Birdsall <em>&amp; </em>Co. to <em>\u201c </em>change the entry and make it the entire loft for Mr. Hamblett.\u201d But this direction by its own terms disclaims any liability on his part, and cannot be regarded as evidence that he considered himself as being bound by a lease of the entire floor, and that he was in search of someone to take his place as tenant.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-5\">Judgment affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-7\">Present: Bookstaveb and Bischoff, JJ.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-8\">Judgment affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
