The answer denies all the material allegations of the complaint except the ownership of the theater by the defendant, and sets up the following affirmative defenses:</p>\n<p id=\"b262-15\">\u201c Y. As and for a second and complete as well as partial answer and defense, this defendant alleges, upon infor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>mation and belief, that at the time claimed by the plaintiff in his complaint to have purchased the license for himself and wife to witness the performance given at the Car-den Theater on the 22d day of May, 1893, the license and privilege to witness the performance at the said theater on said evening was a revocable license; and the said license and privilege for said evening, if ever granted to the plaintiff or his wife, to witness the performance on said 22d day of May, 1893, was duly and regularly revoked, and there was duly and regularly tendered and offered to the plaintiff the sum claimed by him to have been paid for said license, and thereupon all rights of the plaintiff and his said wife to witness the said performance or to remain in said theater ceased and terminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-4\"><em>\u201c </em>VI. As and for a third and further and separate answer, and complete as well as partial defense, this defendant, reiterating and reasserting each and every allegation and denial hereinbefore contained, further alleges, on information and belief, that only such request was made to the plaintiff to leave the said theater as was proper and necessary, and was made after the revocation of any license plaintiff claimed to have to remain in said theater or witness said performance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">The plaintiff now moves that the defendant be required to state in his answer whether the so-called second and third separate defenses thereof are each relied upon and intended as a complete or as a partial defense to the complaint, and to strike out from the so-called separate answer the words \u201c reiterating and reasserting each and every allegation and denial hereinbefore contained,\u201d and for such other and further relief as may be proper in the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">One of the chief grounds urged by the plaintiff in support of the first branch of the motion is, that the question whether the facts set forth, respectively, in paragraphs V and VI, above, constitute a complete defense, cannot be tested by demurrer in the form now pleaded, since the same would be overruled if the facts stated were g\u00f3od in mitigation of damages. No authority directly in point is cited by either side; but considerations of convenience and orderly pleading require that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>the defenses should be separately stated and numbered, and relied upon, respectively, as complete and partial defenses. Pom. Code Def. [3d ed.] \u00a7 690, p. 756. This is in harmony with the provisions of section 507 of the Code of Civil Procedure, which provide that \u201cA defendant may set forth, in his answer, as many defenses or counterclaims, or both, as he has. * * * Each defense or counterclaim must be separately stated and numbered.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b264-4\">I do not perceive why, under modern rules of pleading, the defendant may not count upon the same facts both as a complete and a partial defense. A defendant, may put his defense upon separate and even inconsistent grounds <em>(Goodwin </em>v. Wertheimer, 99 N. Y. 157), and he may plead several pleas to distinct parts of the same count. <em>Longworthy </em>v. <em>Knapp, </em>4 Abb. Pr. 115, 117 ; Stephen\u2019s PI. 269. It seems to follow that the same facts may be pleaded both as a complete and a partial defense, provided each defense is separately stated and numbered. These views lead to fhe denial of that branch of the motion under consideration, provided the defendant shall separately state and number the defenses set forth in paragraphs numbered V and VI of the answer. The granting of which relief, although not specifically prayed for, nevertheless finds ample justification in the concluding sentence of the notice of motion herein. <em>Van Slyke </em>v. Hyatt, 46 N. Y. 259, 264 ; <em>Myers </em>v. <em>Rosenback, </em>7 Misc. Rep. 560 ; 9 id. 89.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">As to the motion to strike out the words \u201c reiterating and reasserting each and every allegation and denial hereinbefore contained,\u201d the following remarks of Professor Pomeroy in his work on Code Eemedies (3d ed.), at page 756, and section 690, are directly in point, viz.: \u201c It is elementary that a defense of new matter should be pleaded, and as- new matter must of necessity be a distinct defense from a denial, it follows that it cannot properly be associated or mingled up with denials, general or specific, in one paragraph or plea.\u201d Consequently the words \u201cand denial\u201d in the last phrase quoted must be stricken out. To hold otherwise would enable the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>defendant to nullify the provisions of section 494 of the Code of Civil Procedure, which allow a demurrer to a defense consisting of new matter contained in the answer. <em>De Witt </em>v. <em>Brill, </em>6 Misc. Rep. 44.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">Except as above indicated the motion is denied, with ten dollars costs to the plaintiff to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">Ordered accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
