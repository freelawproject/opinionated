R. Co., </em>45 N. Y. 628, 632.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-14\">Kor can the appellant, in view of the failure to make such a motion at the close of the whole case, bring up the questions involved under his exception to the denial of his motion to dismiss at the close of the plaintiff\u2019s case. A defendant who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>proceeds to introduce testimony after denial of his motion for a nonsuit at the close of plaintiffs evidence in chief thereby waives his exception to that denial. He has an undoubted right to stand upon his motion for a nonsuit, but he has no right to insist upon his exception after having subsequently put in his testimony and made his case upon the merits, since the court and jury have the right to consider the whole case as made by the testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-4\">It not infrequently happens that the defendant himself by his own evidence supplies the missing link; and if not, he may move to take the case from the jury upon the conclusion of the entire testimony. <em>Bogk </em>v.
