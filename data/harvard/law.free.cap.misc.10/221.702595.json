Corbitt, as Administrator of Mary O\u2019Connor, Respondent, <em>v. </em>The Metropolitan Life Insurance Co., Appellant.</parties>\n<court data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"court\" id=\"b281-4\">(City Court of New York</court>\n<p data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"misc\" id=\"AlO\">General Term,</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AYgD\">November, 1894.)</decisiondate>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b281-5\">Where correct answers are given to an insurance agent to questions contained in the application, but, through fraud or mistake, the agent inserts incorrect and untrue answers, the insurer, and not the insured, is liable for their falsity, and a defense of breach of warranty is not sustainable in an action on the policy.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b281-6\">Appeal by the defendant from a judgment entered on a verdict in favor of the plaintiff.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b281-7\"><em>Arnoux, Bitch, &amp; Woodford, </em>for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b281-8\"><em>M.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ayj\">The jury found, upon evidence justifying the conclusion, that the decedent was the person insured; that the insurance was for the benefit of the estate; that the answers which she made to the agent of the defendant were true, and that the answers which appear in the written application, and on which the defendant founds its defense of breach of warranty, were inaccurately put down by the defendant\u2019s agent, so that, in point of fact, there was no fraud or misrepresentation by the insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-10\">Treating these facts as found adversely to the defendant, the law applicable is that where correct answers are given to an insurance agent to questions contained in the application, but either through fraud or mistake the agent-inserts incorrect and untrue answers, the insurer, and not the insured, is responsible for their falsity, and in an action on the policy the defense of breach of warranty is not sustainable. <em>O\u2019Brien </em>v. <em>Home Benefit Society, </em>117 N.
