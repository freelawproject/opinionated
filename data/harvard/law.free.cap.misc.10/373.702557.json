Wilson and John 0. Van Houten for ten years from May 1, 1893, the lease being dated February 7, 1893, and recorded in the office of the register of said city and county two days thereafter. Among other things the lessees covenanted to <em>\u201c </em>keep the said demised premises, with the improvements, in good repair and condition at their own expense, * * * these repairs to include all inside and outside repairs, roofs, or anything else of whatever kind and description connected with the demised premises, it being understood and intended that no repairs shall fall on or be made by the parties of the first part (the lessors) or that they shall be liable therefor; \u201d and further, that they would <em>\u201c </em>either improve the building now upon said premises or erect new buildings thereon,\u201d and at the expiration of the term surrender to the lessors <em>\u201c </em>the said demised premises * * * and all improvements or repairs of whatsoever nature, * * * together with all and any new or repaired buildings.\u201d On the day succeeding the date of the lease the lessors executed and delivered their written consent to the lessees to \u201c make such alterations in the buildings demised by said lease as they (the lessees) may elect.\u201d Before the commencement of the term the lessees entered into possession of the demised premises and began making improvements and repairs thereto. Between April 15,1893, and June 15, 1893, both dates inclusive, the plaintiffs, at the instance and request of the lessees, performed services and furnished materials of the aggregate value of $584.40, of which $233.76 was for <em>\u201c </em>concreting the cellar, making and laying the cellar floor, and facing the cellar walls,\u201d and $350.64 was for <em>\u201c </em>making and laying an artificial stone sidewalk, and repairing the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>sidewalk,\u201d in the street immediately adjacent to the lot and buildings demised. While the plaintiffs\u2019 work was in progress Charles Lewis, one of the lessors and owners defendant, on several occasions visited the premises, saw the work and orally expressed his approval thereof. Up to the time of the completion of their work the plaintiffs were in actual ignorance of the provisions of the lease, though they knew Wilson and Van Houten\u2019s interest in the premises to be that of lessees only. The lessees having failed to pay the plaintiffs for the work, the latter claimed to be entitled to a lien therefor upon the premises, as against the lessors and owners defendant, pursuant to the provisions of the Mechanics\u2019 Lien Law (Chap. 342, Laws of 1885, as amended by chap. 316, Laws of 1888), and filed a notice of such lien, having in that respect complied with every requirement of the statute to render the notice effectual. This action was brought to foreclose the lien, and upon the facts stated the learned trial judge dismissed the complaint, upon the merits, as against the lessors and owners defendant. From the judgment entered upon such direction this appeal was taken by the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">The question presented, therefore, on this appeal is whether the plaintiffs had acquired a valid hen as against the lessors and owners defendant for the whole or any part of their claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">With regard to so much of the plaintiffs\u2019 claim as is for \u201c concreting the cellar, making and laying the cellar floor and facing the cellar walls \u201d the hen is indisputable. Section 1 of the Mechanics\u2019 Lien Law confers the lien, if the services were performed, or the materials were furnished, with the \u201c consent \u201d of the \u201c owner.\u201d That the \u201c owner \u201d comprehended by the statute is not only the correlative of the \u201c contractor,\u201d as both terms may be popularly understood, and that the \u201c consent\u201d of the \u201cowner\u201d may be predicated of his agreement with another, the lessee or vendee, whereby the latter undertakes to make improvements or repairs at his own expense, was ruled in <em>Husted </em>v. Mathes, 77 N. Y. 388 <em>; Burkitt </em>v. <em>Harper, </em>79 id. 273, and <em>Otis </em>v. <em>Dodd, </em>90 id. 336. True, these cases arose under former statutes, the first under chapter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>402, Laws of 1854, as amended by chapter 489, Laws of 1873, the second under chapter 478, Laws of 1862, and the third under chapter 489, Laws of 1873, as amended by chapter 233, Laws of 1875. Nevertheless, the provisions of the several statutes alluded to are so substantially alike to the provisions of the corresponding sections of the present Mechanics\u2019 Lien Law that the 'rulings last above alluded to have been approved or cited in <em>Schmalz </em>v. <em>Mead, </em>15 Daly, 223 ; 125 N. Y. 188 ; <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Mead, </em>127 id. 544 ; <em>Pell </em>v. <em>Baur, </em>133 id. 377 <em>; Cowen </em>v. <em>Paddock, </em>137 id. 188, and <em>Spruck </em>v. <em>McRoberts, </em>139 id. 193, each of which arose under the present law (Chap. 342, Laws of 1885). The learned trial judge thought the present case distinguishable from those above referred to because of the plaintiffs\u2019 alleged notice of the fact that, pursuant to agreement with the lessees, at whose request and upon whose promise to pay the plaintiffs performed the services and furnished the materials, the lessors and owners defendant were in no manner to be answerable for the improvements or repairs. Neither in <em>Otis </em>v. <em>Dodd, </em>nor in any other of the cases referred to, did it appear that the lienors had, or did not have, notice of a like provision in the agreement under which the persons causing the improvements or repairs to be made were in possession of the premises. Hence, the circumstance of such notice is to be taken as immaterial. But though the determination of the last-mentioned proposition may not be involved in the former decisions, it is our opinion that such notice cannot impair the right to a lien as against the lessors and owners defendant\u2019s interest in the premises. The right to such a lien did not exist at common law. <em>Spruck </em>v. <em>McRoberts, </em>139 N. Y. 193, 197 ; <em>Benton </em>v. <em>Wickwire, </em>54 id. 226 <em>; Mushlitt </em>v. <em>Silverman, </em>50 id. 360 ; <em>Freeman </em>v. <em>Cram, </em>3 id. 305 ; <em>Grant </em>v. <em>Van Dercook, </em>8 Abb. Pr. (N. S.) 465 ; <em>Huxford </em>v. <em>Bogardus, </em>40 How. Pr. 94. It \u201c is a peculiar, particular and special remedy given by statute, founded and circumscribed by the terms of its own creation.\u201d 15 Am. &amp; Eng. Ency. of Law, 5. It is created by the statute, but arises, not from contract, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>but from the employment of services and the use of materials in improvements or repairs with the <em>\u201c </em>owner\u2019s \u201d consent, though it may be incidental to a contract. 15 Am. &amp; Eng. Ency. of Law, 65, note 5 ; <em>Frost </em>v. Ilsley, 54 Maine, 345, 351. The present Mechanics\u2019 Lien Law does not prescribe ignorance of the mechanic or materialman of the \u201cowner\u2019s\u201d agreement with another, whereby the latter has assumed the expense, as a condition of the right to acquire the lien. Hence, we may not annex it. The determinative fact is that the services were employed, or the materials furnished, with the \u201c owner\u2019s \u201d consent. In <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Mead, </em>127 N. Y. 544, 549, it was held that the <em>\u201c </em>owner \u201d and <em>\u201c </em>contractor cannot, by agreement among themselves, to which the lienor was not a party, and of which he had no notice, subordinate the lien of a mechanic or materialman to the <em>\u201c </em>owner\u2019s \u201d claim for advances. Whether the lienor\u2019s rights, as such, would have been impaired if he had notice of the provisions of the agreement the court did not undertake to say.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">However, the question of notice cannot arise in the present case. That the plaintiffs did not have <em>achual </em>notice of the lessees\u2019 covenant to make the improvements and repairs at their own expense appeared from unchallenged proof, if indeed affirmative proof of non-notice was requisite to the plaintiffs\u2019 case, and <em>constructive </em>notice to the plaintiffs, <em>in famor of the lessors and owners </em>defendant, did not arise from the fact of the record of the lease. The Recording Act (3 R. S. 2215, \u00a7 1, Banks <em>&amp; </em>Bros.\u2019 7th ed.) is that \u201c Every conveyance of real estate within this state, hereafter made, shall be recorded in the office of the clerk of the county where such real estate shall be situated, and every such conveyance not so recorded shall be void as against any subsequent purchaser, in good faith, and for a valuable consideration, of the same real estate, or any \"part thereof, whose conveyance shall be first duly recorded.\u201d Its only effect is to afford a means of protection to the grantee against the acts of the grantor. <em>Lacustrine Fer. Co. </em>v. <em>L. G. Fer. Co., </em>82 N. Y. 476, 485. Ho advantage can accrue therefrom to a grantor.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>It appeared on the trial from the testimony of Wilson, one of the lessees, called as a witness for the plaintiffs, that the improvements and repairs were designed to fit the demised premises for the purposes of a hotel and cafe which the lessees proposed to conduct thereon. We are unable to understand how that fact can impair the plaintiffs\u2019 lien in view of the further facts that the improvements and repairs appear to have been of a character which made them substantially a part of the premises, and that the statute under which the lien was acquired does not discriminate against improvements and repairs which are designed for special uses. A different question might have been presented if it had appeared in evidence that the improvements were mere trade fixtures which did not constitute an integral part of the realty. <em>Baum </em>v. Covert, 62 Mass. 113.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">With regard to the improvements and repairs to the <em>sidewalk, </em>however, the lien was not established. We do not question the right of a mechanic or materialman to acquire a lien for improvements or repairs to the <em>sidewalk </em>when made with the <em>\u201c </em>owner\u2019s \u201d consent. This right is expressly given by section 1 of the present Mechanics\u2019 Lien Law. But we predicate our conclusion of the absence of sufficient evidence of the lessors\u2019 and owners defendant\u2019s <em>consent. </em>The <em>\u201c </em>premises demised \u201d were the <em>\u201c </em>lot of ground \u201d with the \u201c buildings \u201d thereon, and the <em>\u201c </em>appurtenances.\u201d Though this must be construed to include the easements of light, air and the means of access in the street adjacent to the premises and necessary to their usual and proper enjoyment <em>(In re </em>N. <em>Y. C. R. R. Co., </em>49 N. Y. 414, 419 ; <em>Mott </em>v. <em>Palmer, </em>1 id. 564, 569 ; 12 Am. &amp; Eng. Ency. of Law, 983 ; Wood Landl. &amp; Ten. 310, \u00a7 213 ; Taylor Landl. <em>&amp; </em>Ten. 111, \u00a7 161 ; Gear Landl. <em>&amp; </em>Ten. \u00a7\u00a7 67, 170), it included no part of the street itself, the control of which was presumptively in the public authorities for such purpose by law established. <em>Prima facie </em>the obligation to maintain the street in proper repair was upon the municipality. <em>Rochester </em>v. <em>Campbell, </em>123 N. Y. 405 ; 24 Am. &amp; Eng. Ency. of Law, 87. That by section 21 of chapter 569, Laws <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>of 1887, the municipality is authorized, in certain cases, to impose the expense incurred as a charge upon the adjacent property does not change the rule. The lessees\u2019 covenant to keep the \u201c demised premises\u201d in good repair cannot be taken as evidence of the lessors\u2019 consent to improvements or repairs elsewhere. Neither was the lessees\u2019 further covenant to \u201c either improve the <em>building </em>now upon said premises, or to erect new <em>buildings </em>thereon,\u201d evidence of a consent to improvements or repairs to the <em>sidewalk. </em>Again, the lessors\u2019 written consent, made subsequent to the date of the lease, was expressly limited to <em>\u201c alterations </em>\u201d in the \u201c <em>buildings </em>demised.\u201d It remains only to inquire whether Charles Lewis\u2019 oral expression of approval while the plaintiffs\u2019 work was in progress may be taken as a <em>consent </em>to the work.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">Waiving the objection that without express authority from his co-owner Charles Lewis\u2019 <em>consent </em>at most subjected his own interest to the lien (<em>White </em>v. <em>M. R. </em>Co., 139 N. Y. 19, 30), the evidence of an oral <em>consent </em>to the plaintiffs\u2019 employment and use of materials for improvements and repairs to the <em>sidewalk </em>is equally deficient. It nowhere appeared that the lessors and owners defendant could lawfully authorize another to make such improvements or repairs, or prevent him from making the same. To <em>consent </em>implies the power to authorize and to prevent, a degree of superiority which arises from the presence of a combined mental and physical ability to act. One cannot properly be said to have <em>consented </em>to an act which he could neither authorize nor prevent. <em>Ottiwell </em>v. Muxlow, 24 N. Y. St. Repr. 38 ; <em>Ottiwell </em>v. <em>Watkins, </em>15 Daly, 308 <em>; Havens </em>v. <em>W. S. El. L. &amp; P. Co., </em>44 N. Y. St. Repr. 589 ; <em>Robbins </em>v. <em>Arendt, </em>4 Misc.
