The plaintiff claims he was not a competent workman, and had not operated the machine long enough to acquire dexterity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>and speed, which seems reasonable, as it is conceded that only 720 coils were made in all, which would be only about twelve hours\u2019 work at the rate of one coil per mihute. This fact also reflects upon the credibility of Washburn, who testified that he \u201c worked at it steadily all day for two or three weeks.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b812-5\">Besides, it is undisputed that owing to Washburn\u2019s inability to see clearly the progress of the wire in the machine and to check the revolution at the proper point, an automatic stop was put on, which necessitated a reversal each time a coil was made, and thereby increased the time required.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-6\">It is to be inferred that this same contrivance was still upon the machine when Lauer made his trial, although there is no direct evidence upon the point.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-7\">Judgment affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-8\">Present: Bookstaveb and Bisohoef, JJ.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-9\">Judgment affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
