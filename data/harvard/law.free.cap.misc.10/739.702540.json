Plaintiff sent the machine to one Balliard, who was to receive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>it as her agent, at his office address, No. 1300 Broadway. Balliard gave the hill of lading to defendant\u2019s driver. Defendant brought the machine to 1300 Broadway, carried it up to the door of Balliard\u2019s office and found the door locked. On the door was a notice directing that articles for Balliard should be delivered to the janitress. It 'appears that defendant went up to Balliard\u2019s office and then returned and carried the machine up-stairs. On his way back with the machine he met the janitress who asked, \u201c What have you got ? \u201d to which he answered, \u201c A machine box for Mr. Balliard.\u201d She then asked if that was all he had, and he replied, \u201cYes,\u201d and went away. The machine was subsequently stolen by parties unknown. We think the defendant delivered the machine in accordance with the directions given him, and his liability thereupon ceased. There was only a-question of fact to be determined. \u2019 The justice decided in favor of defendant and we think the evidence fully sustains his finding. No error of law affecting the verdict was argued.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-4\">The judgment is, therefore, affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-5\">Bischoff, J., concurs.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-6\">Judgment affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
