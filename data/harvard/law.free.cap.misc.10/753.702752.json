A motion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>by the appellant for leave to amend the return by supplying this paper has been denied because not made until after this court had intimated upon the argument its decision upon the questions presented by the return as filed. <em>Warren </em>v. <em>Campbell, </em>37 N.

The appellant has consequently failed to show error of law and only a question of fact remains to be passed upon, and after a review of the evidence we are confirm\u00e9d in our opinion, formed and intimated upon the argument, that the facts would not warrant a reversal of the justice\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-6\">Judgment affirmed, with costs. ,</p>\n<p id=\"b814-7\">Present: Bookstaveb and Bischoff, JJ.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-8\">Judgment affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
