Prior, Appellant, <em>v. </em>Henry M. Flagler, Respondent.</parties>\n<court data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"court\" id=\"b556-6\">(City Court of New York</court>\n<p data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"misc\" id=\"AC7P\">General Term,</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AKF\">December, 1894.)</decisiondate>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b556-7\">Plaintiff was employed as chief cook in defendant\u2019s hotel, the employment being concluded as to details by the defendant\u2019s steward. Shortly afterwards plaintiff was severely injured and claims that the steward agreed that if he would resign his position he should be paid the salary for the remainder of the season. <em>Held, </em>that this was a new and independent contract, and not binding upon defendant without proof of the steward\u2019s authority to make it.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b556-8\">In the absence of proof of authority to make an agreement, evidence as to its terms is inadmissible.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b556-9\">Appeal from a judgment entered upon the dismissal of a complaint at the close of plaintiff\u2019s case.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b556-10\"><em>Dudley R. </em>Horton, for appellant. \u25a0</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b556-11\"><em>Lemitt, Wood d\u00a1 Keith, </em>for respondent.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b556-12\">Conlan, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AWY\">The only question presented on this appeal is whether Tomlinson had authority to make the contract sued on. The plaintiff was employed as chief cook in defendant\u2019s hotel for the season of 1892-1893.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-13\">The evidence shows that plaintiff\u2019s employment originated with a Mr. Seavey, who was general manager of the hotel, and concluded as to details with one Tomlinson, who was acting in the capacity of steward.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-14\">The evidence shows that shortly after plaintiff\u2019s employment he was injured so badly that he was unable to continue his duties as chief cook and was taken to a hospital, when, as plaintiff claims, an agreement was made with the steward Tomlinson that if plaintiff would resign this position the balance of his salary for the season would be paid him. This was an entirely new and independent contract, and to be binding on the defendant must be made by some person having authority to make it.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-15\">We do not think that authority in Tomlinson was shown, and it follows, therefore, that the evidence as to the terms of the agreement was properly excluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>At the close of the plaintiff\u2019s case the court offered to submit the questions of fact to the jury, which was declined by plaintiff\u2019s counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">No errors of law appear in the case, and the complaint was properly dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">Judgment affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-7\">Van Wyck, J., concurs.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-8\">Judgment affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
