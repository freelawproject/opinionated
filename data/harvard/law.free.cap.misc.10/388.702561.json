Tengzelius, called as a witness for the plaintiff, testified that he received the note from the defendant in payment for services to be rendered by him in the investigation of the financial ability of one Collingwood, against whom she at the time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>asserted a claim, and that he transferred the note to the plain- \" tiff in payment of a precedent debt. Defendant admitted Tengzelius\u2019 employment for the purposes mentioned, but denied that she executed or delivered the note produced, and contended that her promise to pay Tengzelius for his services was contingent upon the collection of her claim against Collingwood. The only substantial contest between the litigants was with regard to the genuineness of the note. Upon evidence, to the sufficiency of which neither party at any time objected, the jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff. Hence, for the purposes of this appeal, we may consider only rulings made during the trial, and to which due exception was taken. <em>Schwinger </em>v. <em>Raymond,, </em>105 N. Y. 648 ; <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Pryor, </em>16 Daly, 169 <em>; Gundlin </em>v. <em>Hamburg-American Packet Co., </em>8 Misc. Rep. 291.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-4\">The issue was substantially one of veracity between the plaintiff\u2019s witness, Tengzelius, and the defendant. Evidence of Tengzelius\u2019 reputation as a person of bad character generally was, therefore, admissible to impeach his credibility as a witness in this action (1 Greenl. Ev. \u00a7 461 ; 1 Rice Ev. 630 ; <em>Wright </em>v. <em>Paige, </em>3 Keyes, 581, 586 ; <em>People </em>v. <em>Mather, </em>4 Wend. 229, 257 <em>; Wehrkamp </em>v. <em>Willet, </em>4 Abb. Ct. App. Dec. 548, 556), the credibility of a witness always being in issue. <em>Pharo </em>v. <em>Beadleston, </em>2 Misc. Rep. 424. To an inquiry of Forwood, called by the defendant for the purpose of discrediting Tengzelius concerning the latter\u2019s general .reputation, the plaintiff\u2019s counsel objected on the ground that the evidence called for was irrelevant, incompetent and immaterial, unless confined to reputation for veracity, and <em>\u201c </em>that no foundation has been laid.\u201d The last objection specifically raised the question of the witness\u2019 competency in the absence of evidence that he had knowledge concerning the subject-matter of the inquiry. It was thereupon incumbent upon the defendant, before proceeding with the inquiry, to establish the witness\u2019 competency (1 Greenl. Ev. \u00a7 461 ; 1 Rice Ev. 630 ; <em>Wright </em>v. <em>Paige, </em>3 Keyes, 581, 586), but, though admonished by the learned trial justice in that respect, the defendant\u2019s counsel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>omitted even the effort to do so. The evidence was thus\" properly excluded. To two subsequent inquiries of the same witness, one as to the <em>\u201c </em>general reputation \u201d of Tengzelius, the, other as to his \u201c general reputation as to moral character,\u201d both of which were excluded, the plaintiff\u2019s counsel did not renew his objection that the witness was incompetent; but, having once made the proper objection, he was not called upon to repeat it every time his adversary chose to renew his futile efforts to elicit the testimony excluded from the same witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">A further .inquiry of the same witness, and tending to show that Tengzelius had forged his name to a note, was also properly excluded under objection by the plaintiff\u2019s counsel that the evidence was incompetent, irrelevant and immaterial. Evidence of specific acts of moral obliquity are inadmissible for the purpose of discrediting a witness. <em>Corning </em>v. <em>Corning, </em>6 N. Y. 97, 104 <em>; Wehrkamp </em>v. <em>Willet, supra ; </em>Rice Ev. 629. Without evidence of Tengzelius\u2019 reputation and of the competency of the witness called to discredit him, the exclusion of the inquiry as to whether or not he, the witness, would believe Tengzelius under oath, was obviously proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">Upon Tengzelius\u2019 cross-examination by the defendant\u2019s counsel he admitted that he had suffered a term of imprisonment in the penitentiary. The record of his conviction, however, was not produced, and, against objection, Tengzelius was permitted, upon re-direct examination, to testify that his imprisonment was upon his conviction of a forgery involving two dollars and eighty cents. The admission of this last-mentioned testimony is claimed to have been error. Without discussing the proposition, the alleged error is so palpably harmless that a reversal of the judgment should not result.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-7\">The judgment of the General and Trial terms of the court below should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-8\">Daly, Ch. J., concurs.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b450-9\">Pbyob, J. (dissenting).</author>\n<p id=\"Ae0\">I cannot concur in the affirmance of this judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>Against objection and exception plaintiff\u2019s counsel was permitted to ask the jurors whether the fact that plaintiff\u2019s principal witness had served a term in the penitentiary for forgery would so prejudice them that they would not believe him if his testimony in other respects appeared trustworthy or was corroborated. To me, at all events, the inquiry is without precedent. Interrogation of jurors before impanelled is with a view to a challenge, but a challenge may be made only for matter tending to their disqualification1 or to the revelation of their relations to the cause or the parties. I had not supposed that a juror\u2019s mental attitude toward a witness or species of evidence was ground of challenge either for cause or for favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">In impeachment of plaintiff\u2019s principal witness defendant produced a witness and inquired of him: \u201c What is his (plaintiff\u2019s witness) general reputation?\u201d The evidence was objected to as \u201c irrelevant, incompetent and immaterial,\u201d and because \u201c no foundation had been laid.\u201d That proof of the general character of a witness, without restriction to reputation for truth and veracity, is competent is abundantly sustained by authority. <em>People </em>v. Mather, 4 Wend. 230, 257 ; 2 Cowen &amp; Hill\u2019s Phillips Ev. note, 598.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-7\">Further on the defendant asked his witness: \u201c What is his (plaintiff\u2019switness) general reputation as to moral character?\u201d To which the objection is simply that the evidence was \u201c immaterial, irrelevant and incompetent,\u201d omitting the ground previously stated, \u201c that no foundation had been laid.\u201d The prevailing opinion goes upon the rule that, a party is not obliged to repeat a rejected objection to the same sort of evidence (C<em>hurch </em>v. <em>Howard, </em>79 N. Y. 415) ; but this is not to say that if he renew the objection he need not state the grounds. And, if he states some but not all his former grounds of objection, the inference is that he waives the unspecified and abandoned ones. <em>Hxpressio unius exelusio alterius.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b451-8\">A general objection on -account of incompetency or immateriality is considered as applying only to the competency or materiality of the facts sought to be proved, and not to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>competency of the witness to testify to the facts. <em>Stevens </em>v. <em>Brennan, </em>79 N. Y. 254 ; <em>Schwander </em>v. <em>Birge, </em>10 N. Y. St. Repr. 802. Special objection is indispensable to present the point that the witness is incompetent to testify to the fact. <em>Ward </em>v. <em>Kilpatrick, </em>85 N. Y. 413, 416 ; <em>Amadon </em>v. <em>Ingersoll, </em>34 Hun, 132 ; <em>New Jersey, etc., Co. </em>v. <em>Mayor, </em>14 N. Y. St. Repr. 57. The evidence having been excluded, the plaintiff must stand or fall upon the ground stated.. <em>Tooley </em>v. <em>Bacon, </em>70 N. Y. 34, 37.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">Waiving all this, however, defendant\u2019s witness was competent to speak to the character of plaintiff\u2019s witness. Defendant\u2019s witness knew plaintiff\u2019s witness, saying <em>\u201c </em>He was with us two or-three years,\u201d meaning in the same employment. In <em>People </em>v. Davis, 21 Wend. 309, the impeaching witness-had known the other for a number of years and knew his associates, but was <em>\u201c not acquainted with Sis general character for truth and, veracity ; \u201d </em>and yet he was allowed to testify that \u201c he would believe the other on oath.\u201d The ruling was \u2022 followed in <em>Adams </em>v. <em>Ins. Co., </em>70 N. Y. 166.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">On the authority of these decisions the evidence tendered was legal, and it was error to exclude it. In the cases cited the impeaching witness was not,acquainted with the character of the other; here <em>non constat, </em>but the impeaching witness knew the character he was offered to discredit. The presumption is that were the witness ignorant of the other\u2019s character he would have so answered; or, had he answered that the character of the other was bad, the presumption i\u00a1vould be that he testified to what he knew. The practice is habitual to ask a witness for a fact without first inquiring whether he knows the fact. It is the office of cross-examination to ascertain the means and opportunity of knowledge.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-7\">My conclusion is that the judgment should be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-8\">Judgments of the General and Trial terms of the court below affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
