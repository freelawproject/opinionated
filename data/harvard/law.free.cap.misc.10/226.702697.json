These receipts, signed Peter Otto, are proof that the materials were sold and delivered to him, and it was not error for the court to instruct the jury to find for the plaintiff for the balance of $168.50, unless they should determine that the defendant had paid the same, as he claimed by his evidence. The verdict for plaintiff for such balance and interest is not against the weight of evidence, and the judgment and order are affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-7\">McCarthy, J., concurs.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-8\">Judgment and order affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
