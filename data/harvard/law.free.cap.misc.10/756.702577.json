The chattels in suit had been placed by plaintiff\u2019s vendor in the possession of the New York <em>Herald </em>under a contract for certain printing work in performance of which the use of such forms was required, the contract being made through the defendant, the superintendent of the New York <em>Herald.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b816-12\">Prior to the sale of the chattels to the plaintiff a demand for their return was made of the defendant by the plaintiff\u2019s attorney, then acting on behalf of the vendor, and in reply a - letter was received by him bearing as heading \u201c <em>The Herald </em>\u201d and subscribed \u201cJames. Gordon Bennett, Dulany Howland, Superintendent,\u201d which was to the effect that a deposit would be required as a condition to the return of the goods.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-13\">Recovery below was resisted by the defendant upon the ground that he was but an employee of Bennett, the proprietor of the Herald, and that he had not the possession-of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>chattels, and it is upon such ground that the appeal is rested.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-5\">It is true that a wrongdoer may not plead agency for ' another in extenuation of his wrongdoing, yet, on the other hand, a servant is not to be made liable as for a conversion of chattels of which he has the custody at the hands of his employer and which he refuses to surrender at the demand of a stranger, and this, also, even where he may have reason to believe the stranger to have good title to the chattels. <em>Goodwin </em>v. <em>Wertheimer, </em>99 N. Y. 153 ; <em>Mount </em>v. <em>Derick, </em>5 Hill, 456.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-6\">There appears to be no conflict as to the essential facts of the case, and it was shown that the plaintiff\u2019s vendor in makr ing his contract for the printing work understood that the H\u00e9w York <em>Herald </em>was to assume the performance. His contract was with the <em>Herald </em>through Mr HoAvland; he knew that the defendant \u201cwas superintendent of the <em>Herald; </em>\u201d he ordered the chattels \u201c to be delivered to the Hew York Herald,\u201d and he \u201cemployed the proprietor of the Hbav York <em>Herald </em>to do this work.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b817-7\">Thus, in making the agreement in accordance with which the goods were delivered, the plaintiff\u2019s vendor dealt knowingly Avith the defendant as an agent, and the goods were not then intrusted to the defendant\u2019s personal custody, but to the Hew York <em>Herald.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b817-8\">Possession was not, therefore, in defendant when dominion over the goods Avas originally transferred from the plaintiff\u2019s vendor to the <em>Herald, </em>and the evidence fails to show any change in his relation toward the same, either before or after their sale to the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-9\">Hot having possession, his failure to return the chattels upon demand cannot form the basis of an action against him for their conversion (26 Am. &amp; Eng. Ency. of Law, 729, and cases cited), and while he may have had some control over or access to the goods, this appears to have been but in his character as servant, the identity of his employer being fully disclosed to the parties, and he was thus under no duty to comply with the demand made.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>Upon the facts disclosed the recovery below is not to be sustained, and the judgment is, therefore, reversed and a new trial granted, with costs to abide the event.
