It is, therefore, an insuperable obstacle to the motion that we no longer have jurisdiction of the cause. <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Anderson, 71 N. </em>Y. 599 ; <em>People ex rel. Smith </em>v. <em>Village of Nelliston, </em>79 id. 638.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-7\">. The reason urged for the motion, namely, that since our decision the Court of Appeals has enunciated the principle for which the plaintiff contends, if accepted as ground for a reargument, would be equally valid at any period, however remote from the determination of the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-8\">It had been, understood to be the law of this state that a secret advantage secured by a creditor nullifies a composition agreement as to him, but in June, 1894, the Court of Appeals established the contrary doctrine; may the countless creditors who in the past have lost by operation of the superseded principle now reassert their rights under the new adjudication ? <em>Exped\u00c1t reipubliecB ut sit finis Utium.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b427-9\">A retrospective statute affecting vested rights is void (1 Kent. Com. 455), and of no more efficacy is a retroactive adjudication. <em>Gelpcke </em>v. <em>Dubuque, 1 </em>Wall. 175.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-10\">Motion denied, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-11\">Daly, Ch. J., and Bischoff, J., concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-12\">Motion denied, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
