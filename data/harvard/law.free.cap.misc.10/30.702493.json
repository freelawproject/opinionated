The order of interpleader adjudges that the controversy is about one and the same debt, and that the debt is due to one or the other of the parties in litigation. Which of these parties has the true title to the money is the question for decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-16\">The Supreme Lodge of the Knights and Ladies of the Golden Star is a benevolent association, incorporated under and pursuant to the laws of Hew Jersey. By its certificate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>of incorporation a principal object of the society is \u201c to establish a benefit fund, from which, on satisfactory evidence of the death of a member of the order, a sum not exceeding two thousand dollars shall be paid <em>the family, orphans </em>or <em>dependents, </em>as the member may direct.\u201d A by-law prescribes that <em>\u201c </em>each applicant for membership shall enter upon his application the name of the person to whom he desires the benefit shall be paid in case of death, subject, however, to such future disposal of the benefit as lie may direct; and that any m \u00a1ember may, at any time, surrender his benefit certificate, and a new certificate shall thereafter be issued payable to such person as the member may direct.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">Hpon his admission into the order, in 1887, Charles Gern designated his wife, the defendant, as the beneficiary; and in his certificate of membership directed the bounty to be paid to her on his decease. Afterward, in 1893, he procured a substitute certificate, in which he directed payment of the benefit to the plaintiff. She is not the <em>\u201c </em>orphan \u201d of Gern, nor of his \u201c family,\u201d nor in any sense his \u201c <em>dependents </em>In his application he describes her simply as \u201c friend.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">Which of these certificates authenticates the right to the benefit ?</p>\n<p id=\"b91-7\">The proof is clear and complete that plaintiff\u2019s certificate originated in fraud. Pretending that a Mrs. Wagner proposed to change the destination of <em>her </em>benefit, shortly before his death Gern obtained from the lodge a blank form of application, which he filled in with a direction that a new certificate be issued to <em>hi/m </em>payable to Lina St. Clair Di Messiah. Hence plaintiff\u2019s certificate.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-8\">It is said that the lodge alone may avail of this fraud, and that by bringing the fund into court it signifies its assent to a payment to the plaintiff. Plaintiff\u2019s certificate is the sole muniment of her title, and if that be invalidated she has no claim to the money. By interpleading the parties the lodge brings the fund into court for the one to whom it shall be adjudged. This, surely, is no waiver of the fraud, but is a submission of its effect to the decision-of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>Until the decease of a member of the society his nominee has no right to the benefit; and hence it may be inferred that the fraud of Gern was of no detriment to the defendant. But if the plaintiff\u2019s certificate be nullified by the fraud, then by the death of Gern the defendant\u2019s right is consummate. And, conversely, if plaintiff\u2019s certificate be valid, the defendant\u2019s title is annihilated. If the effect of the fraud were merely to intercept an intended gratuity to the defendant, in a legal sense she would suffer no injury <em>(Hutchins </em>v. <em>Hutchins, </em>7 Hill, 104); but the result of the fraud is the apparition of a rival right destructive of hers, and that competing right she may invalidate by proof of the fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">It is not an answer to the argument that Gern might change the destination of his benefit at pleasure; since he could change it only by a prescribed method and means, and the means and method he employed were vitiated by his fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">Were it necessary, therefore, to a decision in defendant\u2019s favor, I should not hesitate to hold that plaintiff\u2019s certificate is avoided by fraud in its inception, and the formal cancellation of defendant\u2019s certificate of no effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-7\">But, on another ground, defendant\u2019s right to the fund is still more obvious and unimpeachable.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-8\">\u201c The act of incorporation is to corporate bodies an enabling \u25a0 act. It gives to them all the power they possess. It enables them to contract, and when it prescribes to them a mode of contracting, they must observe that mode, or the instrument no more creates a contract than if the body had never been.incorporated.\u201d Mabshall, Oh. J., in <em>Head </em>v. <em>Ins. Co., </em>2 Cranch, 127, 169. Hence, the fundamental principle, that a corporation can exercise no power not communicated by its charter, nor in any other manner than as prescribed by its charter. How, by the certificate of incorporation of the Knights and Ladies of the Golden Star, participation in the benefit fund is restricted to the \u201c family, orphans or dependents \u201d of members. True, the by-laws provide for the issue of a new certificate \u201c to such person as th\u00e9 member may direct; \u201d but -the charter being the supreme law of the body, the by-laws must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>be taken in subordination to the paramount authority and their provisions reconciled therewith. And any provision in the by-laws transcending the power imparted by the charter is <em>ultra 'owes </em>and void. Hence, the only legitimate and the inevitable construction of the by-laws is that the person to be designated as a beneficiary must be of the class specified in the charter. The nomination of a person not of that class is nugatory. <em>Massey </em>v. Mutual, <em>etc., </em>Society, 102 N. Y. 523, 530 ; cases collected in note, 19 Am. St. Rep. 786-790 ; Niblack Mut. Ben. Soc. \u00a7 206 ; Black Ben. Soc. \u00a7 311.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">Hot being of the family of Gem, the plain tiff cannot be the beneficiary of the fund, unless she were his \u201c dependent.3\u2019 But of that relation to Gem no evidence was adduced except such as might authorize the inference that she was his concubine ; and such connection the law disdains to recognize as embraced within the term either of family or dependent. <em>Keener </em>v. <em>Grand </em>Lodge, 38 Mo. App. 543.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">The designation of plaintiff as the beneficiary was without effect, and the certificate under which she claims invalid as a muniment of title. <em>Wendt </em>v. Iowa, <em>etc., </em>72 Iowa, 682. She has no right, therefore, to the fund in dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-7\">Still it may be argued that, at all events, the futile designation of plaintiff as beneficiary suffices to nullify the nomination of defendant as the recipient of the money. To which the sufficient answer is that by the law of the lodge it is not the intent, but the act of changing the destination of the benefit, that replaces the original by the substituted beneficiary; and here, as seen, has been no effectual appointment of the plaintiff. It follows, therefore, that the defendant\u2019s certificate still subsists, and that she is yet the beneficiary of the fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-8\">Upon the supposition, even, that the designation of defendant has been annulled and her certificate valueless, she might, nevertheless, be entitled to the benefit, especially in an action in which the only issue is whether she or the plaintiff has the better right. <em>Hannigan </em>v. <em>Ingraham, </em>55 Hun, 257 ; <em>Keener </em>v. <em>Grand Lodge, </em>38 Mo. App. 543 ; <em>Arthur </em>v. <em>Odd </em>Fellows, <em>etc., Assn., </em>29 Ohio St. 557 ; <em>Supreme Council </em>v. Priest, 46 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>Mich. 429 ; <em>Maryland, etc., Society </em>v. <em>Clendinen, </em>44 Md. 429 ; <em>Bishop </em>v. <em>Grand </em>Lodge, 112 N. Y. 627.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">The special authority adduced by the plaintiff in support of her right <em>(Story </em>v. <em>Williamsburgh M. M. B. Association, </em>95 N. Y. 474) is essentially distinguishable from the case on trial. In the case cited the decision of the court proceeded on the ground that, by issuance of the certificate in favor of the plaintiff, the defendant contracted to pay her. Here, Gern procured the certificate in favor of this plaintiff by imposition on the lodge, and fraud nullifies consent. Ror would even an intelligent and voluntary assent to the nomination of the plaintiff as beneficiary, being beyond the power of the corporation, avail to bind it to the exclusion of the defendant\u2019s prior and paramount right.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">Again, in the <em>Story </em>case the court said: \u201c Ror did the \u25a0appropriation of the fund for her benefit contravene the policy or objects of the association. The plaintiff for sixteen years lived with Story believing herself to be his lawful wife. They had children dependent upon them for support. It was a case where it was the duty of Story to provide for them, and the provision he made through this insurance was in entire accord with the objects of the defendant\u2019s organization.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b94-7\">For thirty years the defendant in the present action was the faithful wife of Charles Gern; she has borne him many children, and doubtless by her industry and self-denial she has assisted him in the accumulation of the means for the purchase of the endowment in question. Upon the evidence it is apparent that, her youth and beauty gone, his affection departed with them, and that by the destination of the bounty to the plaintiff he intended a recompense of services odious in law and abhorrent to a society of which the praiseworthy mission is the succor of the widow and the orphan.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-8\">Between two such claimants, I am happy to be able to award the benefit to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-9\">Judgment for the defendant, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
