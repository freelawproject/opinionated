By express provision of the Revised Statutes (Banks Bros. 7th ed., vol. II, pp. 978, 979, title IV, \u00a7 3, subds. 2, 9) \u201c the fees of the district attorney and all expenses necessarily incurred by him in criminal cases arising within the county, <em>\u2018 </em>and \u2019 the moneys necessarily expended by any county officer in executing the duties of his office in cases in which no specific compensation for such services is provided <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>by law \u201d are made proper charges against the county; and by section 27 of the Consolidation Act (Chap. 410, Laws 1882) all proper charges against the county of Hew York are made such against the corporation of the city and county of New York.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">One who is employed to render services of a particular kind cannot, in the course of such employment, be required to render services of a different character and distinct from those which he has engaged to perform, and if he is commanded by his employer to perform services requiring special qualification, skill and capacity, unconnected with his regular employment, an implied promise arises to pay him, by way of additional compensation, what those services are reasonably worth.

The district attorney of the county of New York is, however, also a city officer within the meaning of the Consolidation Act (Chap. 410. Laws 1882). By chapter 304, Laws of 1874 (Consol. Act, \u00a7 26), the political divisions known as the city and the county of New York were constituted one body corporate and politic, and from thenceforth all county officers were city officers as well. <em>People ex rel. Schultze </em>v. <em>Myers, Comptroller, etc., </em>61 Hun, 500. Sections 46 and 47 of the Consolidation Act (Chap. 410, Laws 1882) require all <em>\u201c </em>heads of departments,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>\u201cboards\u201d and \u201cofficers\u201d of the city so to regulate their expenditures as not to exceed the yearly appropriation, and inhibit the incurring of any expense for which no appropriation was previously made. In the absence of proof of such an appropriation, therefore, it cannot be said that the implied authority of the district attorney, as a public officer, to subject the municipality to liability for the plaintiffs services was extant. No such proof was adduced on the trial. Hence, the facts did not constitute a cause of action against the defendant. In <em>Macdonald </em>v. Mayor, <em>etc., </em>32 Hun, 89, upon which case counsel for respondent here partly relies, the element of an appropriation was present.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-4\">The judgment and order should be reversed and a new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">Bookstaver and Pryor, JJ., concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">Judgment and order reversed and new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
