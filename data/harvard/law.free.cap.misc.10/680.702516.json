As a matter of fact the signatures affixed to the withdrawal notices were forged by Beardsley, and having obtained the checks for delivery to the respective payees he forged their indorsements and placed the checks to his individual credit in the Shoe <em>&amp; </em>Leather Bank of this city, by which bank they were accepted, and to which, upon its indorsement, the amounts called for were paid by defendant and charged against plaintiff\u2019s account.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">It was claimed, and the referee in fact found, that the plaintiff had delayed giving notice of these forgeries to the defendant, after their discovery, beyond a reasonable time, but no proof of damage resulting from such failure was adduced on behalf of the defendant, a\u00bbnd the referee, therefore, determined this point in favor of the plaintiff upon the authority of <em>Third Nat. Bank </em>v. <em>Merchants' Nat. </em>Bank, 76 Hun, 475, where it was held that such a defense proceeds upon the theory of-an estoppel, and that damage to the defendant must be shown in order that it may prevail.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-6\">The case cited was properly followed by the referee in determining this question as to the effect of the plaintiff\u2019s delay upon the matters in suit. It is true that in other states the courts have held that a change of circumstances and resulting damage to the bank\u2019s interest will be presumed where the depositor has unreasonably delayed giving notice to the bank of a discovered forgery, but such a rule has not as yet been adopted by our courts, and at all events its application could hardly be well called for in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-7\">As a matter of fact this defendant cannot be said to have been damaged in any way by the delay noted. The forged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>indorsements were guaranteed by the Shoe <em>&amp; </em>Leather Bank by the force of the latter\u2019s indorsement <em>(White </em>v. <em>Bank, </em>64 N. Y. 320 ; <em>Turnbull </em>v. <em>Bowyer, </em>40 id. 456), and it is-against that institution that the defendant\u2019s remedy lies; not against the forger whose escape the plaintiff\u2019s failure to give' prompt notice of the forgeries may have possibly facilitated. The referee has found that the Shoe <em>&amp; </em>Leather Bank is-\u201ca banking corporation of good credit and repute,\u201d and it does not appear that the plaintiff\u2019s delay in giving notice of these forgeries has injured that credit and repute or affected the defendant\u2019s recourse as against such bank in any way.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-4\">It is further claimed that the plaintiff was negligent in issuing checks payable to its members upon forged applications,, the means of verifying the signatures affixed thereto being at-hand, but we can find no force in the contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">As between these parties the circumstances leading to the issuing of the checks cannot affect the plaintiff\u2019s right that the moneys held. by the defendant upon its account should be paid out only upon its orders, and to the payees named ther\u00e9in or to their order. This is not a case where the doctrine of contributory negligence finds any application in the aspect considered, and it certainly cannot be said that the defendant was at all misled or injured by the plaintiff\u2019s having issued these checks under the circumstances noted. Whatever the methods leading to their preparation, the outward form of these checks, then- validity and the duties of defendant with respect to them were alike unchanged.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-6\">Mor are we to hold that the plaintiff\u2019s failure to earlier discover the fact that the indorsements of the payees\u2019 names-were forged precluded the opening of the accounts periodically stated. It is the duty of the bank to ascertain whether or not the signature of the depositor or the indorsement of the designated payee upon a check is genuine, and the depositor has the right to assume that the question has been determined by the bank when the check is returned to him as evidence of a payment made by his direction. <em>Shipman </em>v. <em>Bank, </em>126 N. Y. 328 <em>; Wachsman </em>v. <em>Bank, </em>8 Misc. Rep. 280 <em>; Frank </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number><em>Bank, </em>84 N. Y. 209 ; <em>Weisser </em>v. <em>Denison, </em>10 id. 68. In this case the plaintiff\u2019s treasurer examined the returned checks as received from the defendant with regard to their dates and amount, and while the signatures of the payees, as indorsed thereon, might have been verified by reference to the records of the association, such verification would appear to be an act in excess of the duty owing from the plaintiff to the defendant. Cases <em>sufra,. </em>True, in <em>Frank </em>v. <em>Bank </em>the court say that a depositor might be held to a duty of making some examination of his returned checks for the purpose of detecting forgeries of his own signature, yet in that case it was further held that in order to preclude a recovery by reason of a failure to make such an examination an injury resulting to the bank would be a necessary element in the consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-5\">The cases do not go to the length of holding that an examination of the indorsements of payees should thus be made, and moreover, as shown above, no injury to the defendant resulted in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-6\">It appears that the issues presented were correctly determined by the learned referee, and the judgment is, therefore, affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-7\">Halt, Oh. J., and Pryor, J., concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-8\">Judgment affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
