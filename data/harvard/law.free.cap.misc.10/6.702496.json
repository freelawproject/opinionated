Proc. Upon the refusal of the trial court to charge a general request that for trespass only nominal damages can be recovered error cannot be predicated, for it cannot be seriously insisted upon that for trespass against the person (an assault) such a rule is correct. We think the testimony sustains the verdict, and that the verdict is not excessive.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-14\">Judgment and order must be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-15\">Osborhe, J., concurs.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-16\">Judgment and order affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
