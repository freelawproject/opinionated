B. did not avail herself of the privilege, but pledged the diamonds with the defendant. <em>Held, </em>that B. had no title and could not confer one upon the defendant, and that the plaintiff was entitled to recover the property.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b130-10\">A pledgee is not a subsequent purchaser or mortgagee, and is not entitled to any benefit under the statute requiring the filing of conditional sale agreements.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b130-11\">Motion by defendant for new trial on minutes.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b130-12\"><em>Geo.

She never availed herself of the privilege of buying, never did buy, and the pin. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>remained the property of Seale <em>&amp; </em>Co. until it was transferred by their general assignment to the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-4\">The baroness had no title whatever to the property, and could not, therefore, convey or pledge it;. and the fact that the defendant in good faith advanced $800 upon the pin gives him no greater right than the baroness herself had. The latter had .a mere naked possession; this has never been held to confer a power of disposition; and an unauthorized sale, although for a valuable consideration, and to one having no notice that another is the true owner, vests no title in the vendee. See authorities collated in <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Clews, </em>114 N. Y. 190 ; <em>Heilbron </em>v. <em>McAleenan, </em>16 N. Y. St. Repr. 957 ; <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>McAleenan, </em>29 id. 406.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">Plaintiff\u2019s assignors never furnished the defendant with any <em>indicia </em>of title, nor have they or he been estopped in any way from asserting title.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">Though the goods were charged to the baroness, it was proved that the entries were made without instructions from the principals, who testified that they would not have sold on credit to a stranger, without security, such goods as diamond ornaments. The jury evidently weighed these considerations in reaching a result. They found for plaintiff for the possession of the property, assessing its value at $1,409.70.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-7\">The defendant, being a pledgee, was not \u201ca subsequent purchaser or mortgagee \u201d within the meaning of the act of 1884, chapter 315, in reference to the filing of conditional sale agreements; he was, therefore, entitled to no benefit thereunder. Can<em>ton S. </em>&amp; <em>D. Co. </em>v. <em>Webb, </em>42 N. Y. St. Repr. 187 ; 16 N. Y. Supp. 932.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-8\">The evidence sufficiently sustains the verdict, and, for the reasons stated, the motion for a new trial must be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-9\">Motion denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
