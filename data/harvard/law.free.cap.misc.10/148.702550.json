J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ajh\">The action was to recover $150 upon a contract for services as musician and leader of orchestra. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>complaint alleged a contract made in November, 1891, for the period of one year, at a weekly salary of $500; that plaintiff entered upon his duties under said agreement, and performed all his obligations toward the defendant, and claimed a balance of fifty dollars a week for three weeks of the 9th, 16th and 23d of April, 1892. The answer denied these allegations, and set up that the contract was not in writing and was not, by its terms, to be performed within one year.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-4\">The defendant\u2019s exceptions present for review the questions whether the plaintiff\u2019s contract was made with defendant or with one Biringer; whether it was within the Statute of Frauds, as alleged in the answer; whether it was performed so as to entitle plaintiff to recover, and also present certain rulings of the trial court in the admission of evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">The contract was undoubtedly made directly with the defendant through its president, Mr. Heilman. Although Mr. Biringer negotiated with plaintiff by means of cable dispatches and letters between America and Europe, it was expressly stipulated between them that no contract was to be made until the arrival of the plaintiff in this country, and after that occurred, which was on December 22, 1891, the contract was made directly with Heilman. Two or three days after his arrival the plaintiff went to Heilman and asked for a written contract, and Heilman replied: \u201cWe do not need a written contract. You will be paid promptly. My word should be sufficient and yours is sufficient for me.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">There had been on plaintiff\u2019s arrival a conversation between plaintiff, Heilman and Biringer, looking to the making of a written contract between Heilman and Biringer and then a contract betw^gi Biringer and the plaintiff, guaranteed by Heilman; but this was not carried out and was merely intended to give Biringer a standing as manager and to secure him a commission or payment out of the plaintiff\u2019s salary. Biringer, while not an employee of the defendant, \u201c was continually in the Eden Musee; it was his business; he had superintendence over the musicians, made out programmes, received applications for engagements,\u201d and all his negotia<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>tions by letter and cable with plaintiff disclosed that he was acting for Heilman, who had originally, as early as June, 1891,, in Europe; negotiated with plaintiff for the proposed engagement, and had stipulated for all the material points of the contract, viz., an orchestra of sixteen men, to include plaintiff\u2019s brother Bela, at $560 a week, with a commission or allowance to Biringer of $50 weekly out of that sum. The first cable from Biringer to the plaintiff in the following October was \u201c Cable if you can begin December 8th in New York on terms arranged with Heilman; \u201d to which plaintiff replied: <em>\u201c </em>Heilman\u2019s condition accepted, sixteen including Bela; arrange for passage on my account; advance $300.\u201d In the last communication, a letter to plaintiff from Biringer, the latter writes <em>\u201c </em>at the request of Mr. Heilman,\u201d and says: \u201c With respect to the contract for a year, Mr. Heilman is of the opinion to make the same first here with me in order to have no difficulties in the country. I hope that in the meantime the word of Mr. Heilman and that of mine will be sufficient.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b210-4\">When plaintiff arrived no such written contract was made, and the only agreement was, as we have seen, directly between plaintiff and Heilman. There was, therefore, no question on that point to submit to the jury, and it is not necessary to discuss the correctness of the instruction of the court to the jury upon the submission of that question, nor the ruling excluding Biringer\u2019s statement as to the arrangements between him and the Eden Musee. Long after the engagement of plaintiff commenced, and on January 26, 1892, Heilman, as president, made a written contract with Biringer, by which the latter agreed to furnish the plaintiff\u2019s orchestra, but this arrangement could in no way affect plaintiff\u2019s ^ect agreement with Heilman.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">The conversation between Heilman and the plaintiff at and after his arrival in this country and the commencement of his service was the only contract between the parties, and while it was not in writing, it was for services then actually commenced and to be performed within the year, and, therefore, was not within the statute. The communications, verbal and written, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>before the plaintiff\u2019s arrival in New York, did not constitute a contract, because it was expressly stipulated that no contract was to be made until arrival. Upon the day of arrival the plaintiff commenced his services at defendant\u2019s request, and a few days after, while they continued, the verbal stipulation was entered into with the president. Although there was then no reference to the terms and conditions previously settled by the president in his oral communication with plaintiff at Marienbad and in the subsequent cables with Biringer, it was manifest that the service then commenced and continued at the president\u2019s request was the employment previously negotiated for and settled upon, and that this was so was manifest from the regular payment of the weekly sums stipulated for up to the last three weeks of the engagement. The case is like <em>Blake </em>v. Voight, 11 N. Y. Supp. 716, where the agreement was not to take effect until a subsequent date, that of the actual commencement of the services; and in this case we have what was wanting in <em>Blake </em>v. Voight, an express verbal agreement at and after the time of the actual commencement of the services.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-4\">The remaining question is as to performance by plaintiff of his obligations so as to entitle him to recover in the action. His orchestra was to consist of sixteen persons, including his brother Bela. This person became insubordinate and was discharged by Biringer, with defendant\u2019s concurrence, for infractions of the rules. In fact, Biringer paid him a large sum to rid the establishment of his presence. The defendant then deducted from plaintiff\u2019s weekly payment fifty dollars, the amount of Bela\u2019s salary. It is for these deductions that the present action 'isTwought.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">The plaintiff is entitled to his whole weekly payment unless he has committed a breach of his contract. Misconduct of one of his employees, for which the latter has to be discharged, is a constructive breach of the contract; for it is an implied obligation of a contractor in plaintiff\u2019s position that those under him and subject to his authority will conform to the rules of the establishment into which he has introduced them. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>and observe the proprieties essential to the decent conduct of a place of public resort, and the defendant would have the right to exclude therefrom any offender. After the discharge of Bela, however, the defendant would not permit the plaintiff to fill his place with any other performer, but continued plaintiff under the contract, deducting from his weekly payments fifty dollars, which was the stipulated compensation of Bela.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-4\">Upon this state of facts it is not easy to perceive what plaintiff\u2019s grievance is, unless he has suffered some damage from the discharge of Bela; but if the latter voluntarily left his employ, upon receipt of a consideration from defendant, there could be no liability on his part to Bela for wages or otherwise, and not having to pay Bela the fifty dollars per week withheld by defendant, he has suffered no loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">At all events, there could be no recovery by plaintiff upon the cause of action alleged in the complaint, viz., for performance of the contract'. He had not performed the contract because of Bela\u2019s misbehavior and consequent discharge or voluntary departure, and the averment of the complaint that he had performed all his obligations to defendant was not sustained. That allegation must be intended as an averment of performance of the contract; otherwise it is a mere legal conclusion, and ineffectual for any purpose as pleading. Under a plea of performance evidence of prevention of performance or of waiver is inadmissible. No recovery could be had except upon proof of performance, and this could not be shown. The defendant objected in due time to the admission of the evidence as irrelevant, and moved to dismiss the complaint for want of proof of performance. The denial of the motion was an error for which a new trial must be granted. <em>O\u2019Leary </em>v. <em>Bd. Ed., </em>9 Daly, 161 ; <em>Elting </em>v. <em>Dayton, </em>43 N. Y. St. Repr. 363 <em>; Morowsky </em>v. <em>Rohrig, </em>4 Misc. Rep. 167 : <em>Oakley </em>v. <em>Morton, </em>11 N. Y. 25 <em>Clift </em>v. <em>Rodger, </em>25 Hun, 39. If plaintiff have a cause of action for damages it must be shown under an amendment of the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">The judgment should be reversed and a new trial granted, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>with costs to appellant of the appeals and of the former trial to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">Bischoff and Pryor, JJ., concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">Judgment reversed and new trial granted, with costs to appellant of appeals and of trial to abide event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
