It appears from the plaintiff\u2019s own papers on this motion that more than three years have passed since issue was joined in the action. Nor does plaintiff offer any excuse or explanation for such gross <em>laches. </em>The suit was actually begun over three years ago, and this application is evidently an afterthought. I am of opinion it should not be granted. <em>Glasberg </em>v. <em>Railroad Co., </em>12 Civ. Proc. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>Rep. 50. An application of this nature should be made upon or soon after the commencement of the action. <em>Ostrander </em>v. <em>Harper, </em>14 How. Pr. 16. The motion must be denied, but without costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">Motion denied, without costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
