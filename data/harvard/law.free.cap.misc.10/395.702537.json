No injustice is apparent from the verdict in the plaintiffs\u2019 favor, and, having speculated upon the chance of a result favorable to themselves, the defendants should not now be heard to complain that it was error to submit the case to the jury. <em>Barrett </em>v. <em>Third Ave. R.

From the absence of an exception to the remark when the learned trial judge, in addressing the jury, said: \u201c I observe that some of you are business men,\u201d it is apparent that the counsel for the defendants did not disagree until after the 'jury had made known the result of their deliberations. It is not to be inferred from the remark that the trial judge intended to instruct the jury that they were to disregard the evidence, and arrive at a result agreeably to their sense of business propriety, or that the jury so understood it.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">The judgment and order should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-7\">Daly, Oh.
