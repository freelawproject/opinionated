Johnston et al., Appellants, <em>v. </em>Thomas Commerford Martin, Respondent.</parties>\n<court data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"court\" id=\"b459-5\">(New York Common Pleas</court>\n<p data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"misc\" id=\"AN0E\">General Term,</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"ALf\">December, 1894.)</decisiondate>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b459-6\">A right of appeal does not survive entry of judgment by consent and the exhaustion of the jurisdiction in the contemplation of the parties.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b459-7\">Upon a failure of the parties to a contract for a resale of certain stock to agree as to price and a refusal by defendant to arbitrate as provided for in said contract, this action was brought for an adjudication that plaintiffs might have the right, if they saw fit to exercise it, to purchase said stock at a price to be fixed by the court. \u2022 Subsequently the action was referred by consent and a stipulation was entered into by which plaintiffs agreed to purchase at such valuation as should be, determined by the judgment, and defendant to deliver on payment of such price. <em>Held, </em>that while the action, as shown by the pleadings, was an anomalous one, of which it was at least questionable whether the court had jurisdiction, the judgment of the referee, because of the stipulation, was virtually an award upon arbitration, and that no appeal would lie therefrom.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b459-8\">Appeal from judgment on trial by referee.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b459-9\">The opinion states the ease.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b459-10\"><em>Thomas J.

The plaintiffs duly asserted their right to a repurchase of the stock under the contract ; and on failure of the parties to agree upon the price and refusal of the defendant to arbitrate this action was brought. The prayer of the complaint is: \u201cFor judgment against the defendant, that it may be adjudged and decreed that the plaintiffs have the right and privilege, <em>if they see fit to exercise the same, </em>of purchasing the said twenty shares of stock from the defendant, <em>at aprice to be fixed by the court </em>y and that the court may fix such price for the same <em>as it deems fai/r and reasonable </em>/ \u201d and for \u201c other and further relief.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b460-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>The case was referred by consent, as we gather, to be heard and determined; and by stipulation <em>\u201c </em>the only issue to be tried is as to the value of the stock.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">It will be observed that the action is neither for breach of the contract to resell nor for breach of the contract to arbitrate, but is rather for specific performance of the two contracts \u2014 the court being substituted as arbitrator of the price \u2014 and this, too, contrary to the fundamental principle which denies to' equity jurisdiction for specific performance of an agreement for arbitration. 56 Am. Dec. 383.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">It will be noticed further that to enforce specific performance of the contract 'to resell would be in violation of the right the plaintiffs assert, namely, an option whether or not to repurchase at the price fixed by the court. And, after all, when the court has heard the cause, and has ascertained the value of the stock, the plaintiffs may make nugatory its action by refusal to repurchase at the price determined. The court is to do nothing more than fix what it <em>\u201c </em>deems the fair and reasonable \u201d price of the stock.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-7\">Has a court jurisdiction, is it its duty, to act as mere umpire of a question, for solving which the parties have provided the expedient of arbitration ?</p>\n<p id=\"b460-8\">Should the court entertain the anomalous suit and fix the price, the plaintiffs may not regard it as \u201c fair and reasonable \u201d \u2014 in fact, they do not so regard it \u2014 and in the exercise of their option may reject the award, as in fact they do reject it. Even as an arbitration the submission is futile.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-9\">So much for the case as it appears upon the pleadings and the stipulated issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-10\">But, by another stipulation, the plaintiffs <em>\u201c </em>agree to purchase and take back the twenty shares of stock now held by the defendant, at such valuation as may be determined -upon by the judgment in this action, and defendant <em>tr'Pl promptly </em>deliver the same on payment of such price. <em>Judgment to that effect map be rendered by the refereeP </em>Accordingly, the judgment rendered by the referee does fix the price, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>does require the defendant to resell and the plaintiffs to repurchase the stock at the price fixed, namely, $350 a share.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">Is it possible for the plaintiffs to appeal from this judgment ? The referee was to fix such price as he <em>\u201c </em>deems a fair and reasonable valuation.\u201d Virtually an award upon arbitration. Rei<em>zenstein </em>v. <em>Hahn, 12 </em>S. E. Rep. 43. The plaintiffs have stipulated to perform it; that is, the \u201c judgment rendered by <em>the </em>referee,\u201d and not the ultimate judgment of this General Term or of the Court of Appeals. In the complaint they allege that they are entitled to have the price fixed \u201c by the decision or judgment of this court so that <em>they may purchase said </em>stoch.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">Ray, more; by express stipulation of record the plaintiffs consented to the judgment and authorized its rendition by the referee; that is, a judgment for the repurchase of the stock \u201c at such valuation as may be determined \u201d by the referee. The judgment rendered is exactly the judgment demanded by the complaint and consented to by the stipulation. Surely, a right of appeal does not survive entry of judgment by consent and the exhaustion of the jurisdiction in the contemplation of the parties. <em>Hooper </em>v. <em>Beecher, </em>109 N. Y. 610.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-7\">If otherwise, however, and assuming the judgment rightly before us for review, we are content to affirm it on the clear, concise and cogent argument of the learned referee.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-8\">Examining the record we perceive no prejudicial error pointed out by exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-9\">Judgment affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-10\">Daly, Oh. J., and Bischobt, J., concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-11\">Judgment affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
