(N. J.) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>42 ; <em>Thornton </em>v. <em>Thornton, </em>3 Rand. (Va.) 179 ; Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7 1532. But the position is untenable.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">It is only by a conveyance to husband and wife that they take as tenants by the entirety. <em>Stelz </em>v. <em>Schreck, </em>128 N. Y. 263 ; <em>Miner </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>133 id. 309 ; <em>Wright </em>v. <em>Sadler, </em>20 id. 320, 323 ; <em>Hulett </em>v. <em>Inlow, </em>26 Am. Rep. 64, and note <em>; Bramberry\u2019s Appeal, </em>36 Am. St. Rep. 64, and note ; <em>Den </em>v. <em>Hardenbergh, </em>18 Am. Dec. 383, note.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">If a man and a woman holding an estate as cotenants marry, they will continue to be joint tenants or tenants in common as before marriage. <em>Moody </em>v. <em>Moody, </em>Amb. 649 ; <em>McDermott, </em>v. <em>French, </em>15 N. J. .Eq. 80 ; 4 Kent, 363.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-7\">John Maier conveyed to the wife; not to <em>husband and wife. </em>Taking but the interest of Maier, Susanna Banzer became cotenant with her husband <em>(Jooss </em>v. <em>Fey, </em>129 N. Y. 17), as such was seized only of her grantor\u2019s estate, and of that in several and distinct freehold. 4 Kent, 367. The husband continued owner merely of his original share, and no privity of estate subsisted between him and his cotenant wife. 4 Kent, 368.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-8\">If marriage between joint tenants, or tenants in common, be inoperative to create an estate by entireties, <em>a fortiori </em>does such effect not follow a conveyance to the wife alone by the husband\u2019s cotenant.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-9\">Plaintiff\u2019s counsel contends, however, that by virtue of the limitation over in the will of Michael Banzer she is a cotenant with the defendants, and so entitled to partition. If cotenant at all, she is cotenant only of Michael Banzer\u2019s moiety, for it was of his own interest merely that he was capable of disposing\u2014the other moiety being the property of Susanna Banzer.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-10\">Upon the construction of the will before me the conclusion is clear that the entire and absolute estate in Michael\u2019s moiety, without limitation over, passed by the devise to Susanna Banzer.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-11\">If the supposed limitation be inapplicable to the realty, then the gift and devise merely- would convey it in fee simple abso<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>lute; much more when coupled with an express and unrestricted power of alienation. <em>Foose </em>v. <em>Whitmore, </em>82 R. Y. 405, 407.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">Conceding, however, that the supposed limitation applies as well to the real as to the personal property \u2014 a position strenuously contested by the defendants \u2014 the deduction is ,still inevitable.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">Bearing in mind that the will is obviously the composition of an illiterate layman, we observe that, without reservation or qualification, it <em>gives </em>and <em>bequeaths </em>all his property to Susanna Banzer, with the right to do with it and dispose of it according to her own judgment \u2014 an absolute and beneficial power of disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-7\">\u201c The precise question presented, therefore, for our determination is, whether an executory devise can be made to depend on the nonexecution by the first taker of an absolute beneficial disposing power, vested in him by the will creating the limitation, or, in other words, whether there can be' a valid executory devise where the executory limitation is conjoined with an absolute power in the primary devisee to defeat and cut off the future estate or interest by alienation of the entire fee in his lifetime, and whether it makes any difference as to the rights of the ulterior devisee whether the power has or has not been exercised. * * * This question is answered by an unbroken line of authorities in this state, and the almost uniform course of decision elsewhere, against the validity of such a limitation.\u201d Andrews, J., in <em>Van Horne </em>v. <em>Campbell, </em>100 N. Y. 287, 294 ; see, also, <em>Campbell </em>v. <em>Beaumont, </em>91 id. 464 <em>; Clarke v. Leupp, </em>88 id. 228 <em>; Buckland </em>v. Gallup., 22 Wkly. Dig. 23 ; <em>Griswold </em>v. <em>Warner, </em>51 Hun, 12 ; <em>Rood </em>v. <em>Watson, </em>54 id. 85 ; <em>Roseboom </em>v. <em>Roseboom, </em>81 N. Y. 356 <em>; Foose </em>v. <em>Whitmore, </em>82 id. 405 ; <em>Hermance </em>v. <em>Mead, </em>18 Abb. N. C. 90 ; <em>Matter of Le Fevre, </em>5 Dem. 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-8\">In the masterly opinion of Judge Andrews, the limitation under criticism is discriminated from a valid executory devise by the decisive test, that here \u201c is interposed between the primary and secondary limitation a disposing power whereby the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>first taker was entitled to dispose of the whole fee for her own benefit, and thereby cut off and defeat the ulterior limitation.\u201d 100 N. Y. 293.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-4\">My conclusion is, that the limitation is invalid for repugnancy to the previous devise of the <em>entire </em>and absolute estate. And, since the only claim of interest in the property by the plaintiff is by virtue of that limitation, it results that the complaint must be dismissed on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">Judgment accordingly, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
