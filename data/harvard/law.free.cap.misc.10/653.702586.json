The judgment has been affirmed by the General Term of the court below, on the ground of variance between the proof tendered and the defense pleaded ; and we are to determine whether the ruling may be supported upon any principle in the law of New York.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-15\">The maxim invoked by the court below, that judgment must be <em>secundum allegata et probata, </em>applies only to the substance, not to the circumstances, of a claim or defense. So that, upon principle, if there be a substantial identity between the plea and the proof, a circumstantial variation is of no consequence. <em>Place </em>v. <em>Minster, </em>65 N. Y. 89, 90.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-16\">By the Code (\u00a7 539) a defense offered is a variance from the defense pleaded only upon proof to the satisfaction of the court that it has actually misled the plaintiff to his prejudice. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>If no such variance he so shown the court may allow an immediate amendment, or direct the fact to he found according to the evidence. Code, \u00a7 540.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">Here, between the surrender pleaded and the surrender tendered in proof there was no single discrepancy, except in the predicate of time\". Under the common-law system of pleading, while indispensable to state the time of occurrence of every material and traversable fact, it is unnecessary to prove the time as alleged, unless a constituent of the cause of action or defense. 1 Chitty PI. 259. So, under the Code, if the time a fact happened be material to the cause of action or to the defense, it must be specified and proved. <em>People ex rel. Crane </em>v. Ryder, 12 N. Y. 433 ; <em>Patterson </em>v. Baker, 6 T. &amp; C. 76 ; 3 Hun, 398. But when the only materiality of the statement of time is to show the order in which events occurred, it suffices to aver that the one event preceded the other, without designating the date of either. <em>Brown </em>v. Harmon, 21 Barb. 508 ; <em>Kellogg </em>v. Baker, 15 Abb. Pr. 286, 289 ; <em>Martin </em>v. <em>Kanouse, </em>2 id. 230. Hence as, by the answer and the tender of proof, the surrender antedated the accrual of the rent, the day or month of the surrender was of no moment to its efficacy as a defense. And the discrepancy in the time of the surrender, as stated and offered to be shown, in the absence of evidence of prejudicial surprise, afforded no justification for rejection of the proof of surrender. Code, \u00a7 540 <em>; Craig </em>v. <em>Ward, </em>36 Barb. 377 <em>; Catlin </em>v. <em>Gunter, </em>11 N. Y. 368 ; <em>Place </em>v. <em>Minster, </em>65 id. 89, 104 <em>; Hauck, </em>v. <em>Craighead, </em>4 Hun, 561.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-6\">(Since the variance between the defense pleaded and the defense tendered in proof was immaterial, no amendment of the answer was necessary (Code, \u00a7 539), and the court erred in the exclusion of the evidence. In any event, the discretion of the court was confined to the alternative of an immediate amendment or a finding of the fact according to the evidence; one or the other the court was bound to allow, and by refusing both it committed mainifest error.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-7\">Again, at every stage of an action, <em>\u201c </em>the court <em>must </em>disre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>gard an error or defect in the pleadings or proceedings which does not affect the substantial rights of the adverse party.\u201d Code, \u00a7 723 ; <em>Weil </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>24 Hun, 645, 646. This beneficent statute of jeofail, designed expressly to relax the rigor of the common law, and prevent a defeat of justice by mere informalities in pleading or procedure, the court below has nullified, by a ruling for which no precedent is to be found, even in the arbitrary and illiberal system which our Code supersedes.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-4\">The respondent essays to uphold the judgment by objections to the sufficiency of the facts shown to constitute a surrender, to which attempt a two-fold reply is obvious: <em>First, </em>that the appellant was checked in the production of his proof; and, <em>secondly, </em>that the points now urged were not presented or determined in the court below. Our function is only to review errors in the actual adjudication of the City Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">We may add, however, that the Statute of Frauds is of no avail against an accepted surrender. <em>Kelly </em>v. <em>Noxon, </em>64 Hun, 282 ; <em>Hurley </em>v. <em>Sehring, </em>43 N. Y. St. Repr. 240 <em>; Vandekar </em>v. <em>Reeves, </em>40 Hun, 430.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-6\">J udgment reversed and new trial ordered, costs to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-7\">Daly, Oh. J., and Bischoff, J., concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-8\">Judgment reversed and new trial ordered, costs to abide event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
