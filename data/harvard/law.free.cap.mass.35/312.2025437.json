The defendants denied that the bridge was upon the county road as located, and by a survey according to the record, proved that the bridge was some rods aside from it The jury were instructed, that the defendants could not set up <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>this inislocation of the road in defence of the action, and that t.he evidence was sufficient to show that the road as travelled had been dedicated to the public.

It is very clear that the use of the bridge by the public and the erection and support of it by the town for thirty-eight years, is sufficient proof of its existence as a highway.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">It may well be doubted, whether a town, which, in making and repairing a highway, has by accident or design deviated from the true location, should be allowed to deny their liability to maintain it as they have made it. It would be a dangerous imposition upon the public, and their conduct should be deemed an estoppel era <em>pais.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b321-7\">Long occupation and enjoyment unexplained, will raise a presumption of a grant, not only of an easement, but of the land itself; and not only of a grant, but of acts of legislation and matters of record. And grants may be presumed not only to individuals and corporations, but to the Commonwealth. The statute of 1786, c. 67, \u00a7 7, was not intended to affect the existing modes of acquiring ways, public or private, hut only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>to establish the boundaries between existing ways, and public fields, and the adjoining owners.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-8\">Here were facts from which a laying out, a grant, or a dedication, might be presumed. The authorities cited by the plaintiff\u2019s counsel fully support all the above positions.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-9\">\n<em>Judgment on the verdict</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
