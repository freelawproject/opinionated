The estate of the defendant\u2019s testator having been represented to be insolvent, a commission of insolvency was issued thereon on the 6th of. March, 1833, and six months were allowed to creditors to ' present and prove their claims. The commissioners held their last session on the 6th of September, 1833, when they rejected the claim of the plaintiff. The plaintiff filed a notice in the probate office on the 2d of October, 1833, that he should bring an action at common law, and this action was accordingly commenced on the 18th of October, 1833, the writ being return able in February, 1834. The report of the commissioners was received, considered, and ordered to be recorded, by the Probate Court, on the 7th of January, 1834.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b264-7\">A verdict was taken for the plaintiff; and the question, whether the notice was conformable to the <em>St. </em>1784, c. 2, was reserved for the consideration of the whole Court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"ANZz\"><em>Lancklon, </em>for the defendant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Af1\">cited <em>Ellsworth </em>v.

By <em>St. </em>1784, <em>c. </em>2, the notice is to be given by a creditor whose claim is rejected by the commissioners, within twenty days after such rejection. The proper evidence of the rejection of the claim is the return of the report to the probate office, and the acceptance thereof bythe Probate Court. This was so held in <em>Ellsworth v. Thayer, </em>4 Pick. 122, and that notice given betore the return of the report of the commissioners was premature, and not a compliance with the requisitions of the statute, which is a condition precedent to the maintenance of the action. That case is decisive of the present, against the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-12\"><em>Verdict set aside, and, by </em>consent, <em>plaintiff nonsuit.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
