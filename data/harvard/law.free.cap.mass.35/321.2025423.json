Day, which were due before the 7th of August, 1833, and the third, which became due on the 7th of October, 1833, made by Day &amp; Co. On each of these notes was an indorsement to the following effect : \u201c Westfield, August 7th, 1833. Received of Marsh, Gilbert &amp; Co. [the plaintiffs] fifty cents, in consideration whereof, I hereby warrant this note good and collectable two years.

The only question is upon the construction of the defendant\u2019s guaranty, which being given upon a pecuniary consideration, was a valid one. The obligation of a guarantor or surety, is not to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>extended beyond the plain scope of his undertaking. The defendant\u2019s undertaking is, in each case, to warrant the note good and collectable, two years. Two of the notes' were then due and payable ; the other was not due. The true construction of this contract, in the opinion of the Court, is, that the notes shall remain good and capable of being collected, for the erm of two years. If, therefore, upon taking proper measures to collect them, at any time after they were due, within two years, they could not be collected, it was a breach of the defendant\u2019s promise, for which an action lies. The expression of the term of two years, we think, was to limit the extent of the guaranty, which would otherwise have been indefinite, and this construction is favorable to the guarantor.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-7\">\n<em>Defendant defaulted.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
