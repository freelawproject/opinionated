The whole consideration was an agreement, testified to have been made at the time, by which it. was stipulated, that the tenant should give up to the grantor, securities held against him amounting to the sum of $ 1000. These securities were not specified, and were not given up until the 22d of January, 1832, when several negotiable notes, amounting to the sum of $1176, were delivered up to the' grantor by the tenant, and a new note taken for the excess over the sum of $ 1000.</summary>\n<otherdate data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b382-12\">\n<em>Oct. 5th.</em>\n</otherdate>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b382-7\">The demandant contended, that under the circumstances ol the case, the intervention of his attachment between the execution of the deed and the actual payment of the consideration, defeated the conveyance to the tenant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b382-8\">The demandant further contended, that the deed was void , that as a life estate was granted and a life estate taken back, the deed was destructive of itself; that even if it might have any validity between the parties thereto, it was, upon its face, void against a <em>bona fide </em>creditor of the grantor, as fraudulent or conclusive evidence of fraud in law ; and that it was made with intent to defiaud creditors.

The tenant claims under a deed from Paul Dudley, the former owner of the demanded premises ; but the demandant objects that this deed is fraudulent on the face of it, and that on this ground the verdict ought to be set aside. It is true, that the stipulation of the tenant, or the condition in the deed, for the support and maintenance of the grantor and his wife, was <em>prima facie </em>evi dence of fraud ; but it was open to explanation, and was explained to the satisfaction of the jury. The evidence is not reported, but it is understood that the full value of the estate was paid, and if so, the agreement to support the grantor and his wife, although it might appear to be a suspicious circum stance, was gratuitous, but not conclusive evidence of fraud. The whole evidence was submitted to the jury, and we cannot say that they have done wrong by establishing the deed. The circumstance, that the notes were not given up at the time the deed was executed, nor until after the attachment, is but a slight circumstance ; for the tenant agreed to give them up, and that agreement was binding.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">It was also contended, that upon a fair construction of the deed, the stipulation as to the board and maintenance of the grantor and his wife, amounts to a reservation ; but we think, that neither the words of the deed, nor the general rules by which all conveyances are to be construed, will admit such a construction. -For a life estate only passed by the grant, and if by the reservation a life estate were taken back, the reservadon would be repugnant to the grant and void. The stipulation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>in question was, therefore, clearly a condition, and the condition does not appear to have been broken; so that the tenant\u2019s title remains unimpaired, and the question as to the supposed trust under the codicil of Benjamin Dudley becomes immaterial.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-7\">\n<em>Judgment on the verdict.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
