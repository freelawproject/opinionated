At the trial, in the Court ol Common Pleas, before <em>Williams </em>J., the plaintiff offered evidence tending to prove that the two defendants, Graves and Clapp, hired of the plaintiff the mares in question, together with a wagon, to go to Hinsdale in New Hampshire ; that they drove the mares to Chesterfield, a town seven miles beyond Hinsdale ; and that on their return the mares were much injured.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b363-8\">The defendants contended, that the mares were hired by Clapp alone ; that Graves was a mere passenger, and not responsible in any event; and that by the original contract, the mares were to go to Chesterfield.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b363-9\">There was no direct evidence of any express hiring by Graves ; and the defendants offered in evidence the testimony of two witnesses, which tended to prove, that on the day previous to the departure of the defendants for Chesterfield, Clapp agreed with Graves to carry him and his wife to Chesterfield for seven dollars.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b363-10\">The plaintiff\" objected to the admission of this testimony, unless it should be shown that the knowledge of this fact had boon communicated to him. But the objection was overruled and the testimony admitted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b363-11\">The defendants also offered in evidence the deposition of Hannah Fiske, taken by virtue of a commission in the common printed form, directed \u201c to any justice of the peace, &amp;c. in New Hampshire.\u2019\u2019 The plaintiff objected to the admission of this deposition, because, as he contended, it did not appear, that Larkin G. Mead, before whom the deposition was taken, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>was a justice of the peace, and it was incumbent on the defendants to show that fact by other evidence than the signature ot Mead himself, upon the deposition. This objection also was overruled, and the deposition admitted.</summary>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b364-6\">\n<em>Oct. 1st.</em>\n</decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b364-8\">The jury returned a verdict in favor of both defendants , and the plaintiff thereupon excepted to the rulings of the Court</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b364-9\"><em>R.

Sawyer, 8 Pick. 397; <em>Jacobs </em>v. <em>Putnam, </em>4 Pick. 108; <em>Carter </em>v. <em>Gregory, </em>8 Pick. 165; <em>Allen </em>v. <em>Duncan, </em>11 Pick. 308.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b364-10\"><em>I. C. Bates </em>and <em>C. A. Dewey, </em>for the defendants,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AJ7\">as to the first objection, cited <em>Rice </em>v. <em>Bancroft, </em>11 Pick. 469; <em>Boyden </em>v. <em>Moore, </em>11 Pick. 362; <em>Allen </em>v. <em>Duncan, </em>11 Pick. 308, and as to the second, <em>Clement </em>v. <em>Durgin, </em>5 Greenl. 9.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b364-11\">Shaw C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AVF\">afterwards drew up the opinion of the Court. There being no evidence of a hiring by the defendant Graves, we think it was competent for him, in an action charging him as a wrong-doer, jointly with the defendant Clapp, to explain his apparent connexion with the latter, by proving that he was a passenger only. Besides, in the event, this fact became immaterial, there being a verdict in favor of both defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-12\">The Court are also of opinion, that the deposition was rightly admitted. By the Rule of Court, (old Rules, 11, in Metcalf\u2019s Dig. 306 ; new Rules, 6,) where a deposition is taken under a commission directed to any justice, &amp;c. the certificate of execution on the return of such commission, by a person professing to act as such magistrate, shall be <em>prima facie </em>evidence of his official character, and the burden of proof shall lie on the party objecting. The argument in support of the objection in the present case is, that this rule applies only to cases where the commission is addressed to some particular justice of the peace or other officer by name. This we think is not a sound construction of the rule. Where the commission is directed to a person by name, it is immaterial whether he has any official character or not; he would have sufficient authority to take the deposition from the commission itself. Such it is believed has been the practice under these rules, both here, and in Maine. <em>Clement </em>v. <em>Durgin, </em>5 Greenl. 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-13\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled, and judgment of the Court of Com - mon Pleas affirmed</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
