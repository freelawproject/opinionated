Code, \u00a7 14063)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> because they were medically indigent, i.e., they had insufficient financial resources to pay for their own medical care. In 1979, when the electorate adopted section 6, the state provided Medi-Cal coverage to these medically indigent adults without requiring financial contributions from counties. Effective January 1, 1983, the Legislature excluded this population from Medi-Cal. (Stats. 1982, ch. 328, \u00a7\u00a7 6, 8.3, 8.5, pp. 1574-1576; Stats. 1982, ch. 1594, \u00a7\u00a7 19, 86, pp. 6315, 6357.) Since that date, San Diego has provided medical care to these individuals with varying levels of state financial assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-8\">To resolve San Diego\u2019s claim, we must determine whether the Legislature\u2019s exclusion of medically indigent adults from Medi-Cal \u201cmandate[d] a new program or higher level of service\u201d on San Diego within the meaning of section 6. The Commission on State Mandates (Commission), which the Legislature created to determine claims under section 6, has ruled that section 6 does not apply to the Legislature\u2019s action and has rejected reimbursement claims like San Diego\u2019s. (See <em>Kinlaw </em>v. <em>State of California </em>(1991) 54 Cal.3d 326, 330, fn. 2 [285 Cal.Rptr. 66, 814 P.2d 1308] <em>(Kinlaw).) </em>The trial court and Court of Appeal in this case disagreed with the Commission, finding that San Diego was entitled to reimbursement. The state seeks <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>reversal of this finding. It also argues that San Diego\u2019s failure to follow statutory procedures deprived the courts of jurisdiction to hear its claim. We reject the state\u2019s jurisdictional argument and affirm the finding that the Legislature\u2019s exclusion of medically indigent adults from MediCal \u201cmandate[d] a new program or higher level of service\u201d within the meaning of section 6. Accordingly, we remand the matter to the Commission to determine the amount of reimbursement, if any, due San Diego under the governing statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-4\">I. Funding of Indigent Medical Care</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">Before the start of Medi-Cal, \u201cthe indigent in California were provided health care services through a variety of different programs and institutions.\u201d (Assem. Com. on Public Health, Preliminary Rep. on Medi-Cal (Feb. 29, 1968) p. 3 (Preliminary Report).) County hospitals \u201cprovided a wide range of inpatient and outpatient hospital services to all persons who met county indigency requirements whether or not they were public assistance recipients. The major responsibility for supporting county hospitals rested upon the counties, financed primarily through property taxes, with minor contributions from\u201d other sources. <em>{Id. </em>at p. 4.)</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">Medi-Cal, which began operating March 1, 1966, established \u201ca program of basic and extended health care services for recipients of public assistance and for medically indigent persons.\u201d <em>(Morris </em>v. <em>Williams </em>(1967) 67 Cal.2d 733, 738 [63 Cal.Rptr. 689, 433 P.2d 697] (Morris); <em>id. </em>at p. 740; see also Stats. 1966, Second Ex. Sess. 1965, ch. 4, \u00a7 2, p. 103.) It \u201crepresented] California\u2019s implementation of the federal Medicaid program (42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1396-1396v), through which the federal government provide[d] financial assistance to states so that they [might] furnish medical care to qualified indigent persons. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Robert F. Kennedy Medical Center </em>v. <em>Belsh\u00e9 </em>(1996) 13 Cal.4th 748, 751 [55 Cal.Rptr.2d 107, 919 P.2d 721] <em>(Belsh\u00e9).) </em>\u201c[B]y meeting the requirements of federal law,\u201d Medi-Cal \u201cqualified] California for the receipt of federal funds made available under title XIX of the Social Security Act.\u201d <em>(Morris, supra, </em>67 Cal.2d at p. 738.) \u201cTitle [XIX] permitted the combination of the major governmental health care systems which provided care for the indigent into a single system financed by the state and federal governments. By 1975, this system, at least as originally proposed, would provide a wide range of health care services for all those who [were] indigent regardless of whether they [were] public assistance recipients . . . .\u201d (Preliminary Rep., <em>supra, </em>at p. 4; see also Act of July 30, 1965, Pub.L. No. 89-97, \u00a7 121(a), 79 Stat. 286, reprinted in 1965 U.S. Code <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>Cong. &amp; Admin. News, p. 378 [states must make effort to liberalize eligibility requirements \u201cwith a view toward furnishing by July 1, 1975, comprehensive care and services to substantially all individuals who meet the plan\u2019s eligibility standards with respect to income and resources\u201d].)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b113-4\">However, eligibility for Medi-Cal was initially limited only to persons linked to a federal categorical aid program by age (at least 65), blindness, disability, or membership in a family with dependent children within the meaning of the Aid to Families with Dependent Children program (AFDC). (See Legis. Analyst, Rep. to Joint Legis. Budget Com., Analysis of 1971-1972 Budget Bill, Sen. Bill No. 207 (1971 Reg. Sess.) pp. 548, 550 (1971 Legislative Analyst\u2019s Report).) Individuals possessing one of these characteristics (categorically linked persons) received full benefits if they actually received public assistance payments. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 550.) Lesser benefits were available to categorically linked persons who were only medically indigent, i.e., their income and resources, although rendering them ineligible for cash aid, were \u201cnot sufficient to meet the cost of health care.\u201d <em>(Morris, supra, 67 </em>Cal.2d at p. 750; see also 1971 Legis. Analyst\u2019s Rep., <em>supra, </em>at pp. 548, 550; Stats. 1966, Second Ex. Sess. 1965, ch. 4, \u00a7 2, pp. 105-106.)</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">Individuals not linked to a federal categorical aid program (non-categorically linked persons) were ineligible for Medi-Cal, regardless of their means. Thus, \u201ca group of citizens, not covered by Medi-Cal and yet unable to afford medical care, remained the responsibility of\u2019 the counties. <em>(County of Santa Clara </em>v. <em>Hall </em>(1972) 23 Cal.App.3d 1059, 1061 [100 Cal.Rptr. 629] <em>(Hall).) </em>In establishing Medi-Cal, the Legislature expressly recognized this fact by enacting former section 14108.5, which provided: \u201cThe Legislature hereby declares its concern with the problems which will be facing the counties with respect to the medical care of indigent persons who are not covered [by Medi-Cal] . . . and . . . whose medical care must be financed entirely by the counties in a time of heavily increasing medical costs.\u201d (Stats. 1966, Second Ex. Sess. 1965, ch. 4, \u00a7 2, p. 116.) The Legislature directed the Health Review and Program Council \u201cto study this problem and report its findings to the Legislature no later than March 1, 1967.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">Moreover, although it required counties to contribute to the costs of Medi-Cal, the Legislature established a method for determining the amount of their contributions that would \u201cleave them with Qsufficient funds to provide hospital care for those persons not eligible for Medi-Cal.\u201d <em>(Hall, supra, </em>23 Cal.App.3d at p. 1061, fn. omitted.) Former section 14150.1, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>which was known as the \u201ccounty option\u201d or the \u201coption plan,\u201d required a county \u201cto pay the state a sum equal to 100 percent of the county\u2019s health care costs (which included both linked and nonlinked individuals) provided in the 1964-1965 fiscal year, with an adjustment for population increase; in return the state would pay the county\u2019s entire cost of medical care.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>(County of Sacramento </em>v. <em>Lackner </em>(1979) 97 Cal.App.3d 576, 581 [159 Cal.Rptr. 1] <em>(Lackner).) </em>Under the county option, \u201cthe state agreed to assume all county health care costs ... in excess of\u2019 the county\u2019s payment. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 586.) It \u201cmade no distinction between \u2018linked\u2019 and \u2018nonlinked\u2019 persons,\u201d and \u201csimply guaranteed a medical cost ceiling to counties electing to come within the option plan.\u201d <em>{Ibid.) </em>\u201cAny difference in actual operating costs and the limit set by the option provision [was] assumed entirely by the state.\u201d (Preliminary Rep., <em>supra, </em>at p. 10, fn. 2.) Thus, the county option \u201cguarantee^] state participation in the cost of care for medically indigent persons who [were] not otherwise covered by the basic Medi-Cal program or other repayment programs.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> (1971 Legis. Analyst\u2019s Rep., <em>supra, </em>at p. 549.)</p>\n<p id=\"b114-4\">Primarily through the county option, Medi-Cal caused a \u201csignificant shift in financing of health care from the counties to the state and federal government. . . . During the first 28 months of the program the state . . . paid approximately $76 million for care of non-Medi-Cal indigents in county hospitals.\u201d (Preliminary Rep., <em>supra, </em>at p. 31.) These state funds paid \u201ccosts that would otherwise have been borne by counties through increases in property taxes.\u201d (Legis. Analyst, Rep. to Joint Legis. Budget Com., Analysis of 1974-1975 Budget Bill, Sen. Bill No. 1525 (1973-1974 Reg. Sess.) p. 626 (1974 Legislative Analyst\u2019s Report).) \u201c[F]aced with escalating Medi-Cal costs, the Legislature in 1967 imposed strict guidelines on reimbursing counties electing to come under the \u2018option\u2019 plan. ([Former] \u00a7 14150.2.) Pursuant to subdivision (c) of [former] section 14150.2, the state imposed a limit on its obligation to pay for medical services to nonlinked persons <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>served by a county within the \u2018option\u2019 plan.\u201d (Lackner, <em>supra, </em>97 Cal.App.3d at p. 589; see also Stats. 1967, ch. 104, \u00a7 3, p. 1019; Stats. 1969, ch. 21, \u00a7 57, pp. 106-107; 1974 Legis. Analyst\u2019s Rep., <em>supra, </em>at p. 626.)</p>\n<p id=\"b115-4\">In 1971, the Legislature substantially revised Medi-Cal. It extended coverage to certain noncategorically linked minors and adults \u201cwho [were] financially unable to pay for their medical care.\u201d (Legis. Counsel\u2019s Dig., Assem. Bill No. 949, 3 Stats. 1971 (Reg. Sess.) Summary Dig., p. 83; see Stats. 1971, ch. 577, \u00a7\u00a7 12, 23, pp. 1110-1111, 1115.) These medically indigent individuals met \u201cthe income and resource requirements for aid under [AFDC] but [did] not otherwise qualify[] as a public assistance recipient.\u201d (56 Ops.Cal.Atty.Gen. 568, 569 (1973).) The Legislature anticipated that this eligibility expansion would bring \u201capproximately 800,000 additional medically needy Californians\u201d into Medi-Cal. (Stats. 1971, ch. 577, \u00a756, p. 1136.) The 1971 legislation referred to these individuals as \u201c \u2018[n]oncategorically related needy person[s].\u2019 \u201d (Stats. 1971, ch. 577, \u00a7 23, p. 1115.) Subsequent legislation designated them as \u201cmedically indigent person[s]\u201d (MIP\u2019s) and provided them coverage under former section 14005.4. (Stats. 1976, ch. 126, \u00a7 7, p. 200; <em>id. </em>at \u00a7 20, p. 204.)</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">The 1971 legislation also established a new method for determining each county\u2019s financial contribution to Medi-Cal. The Legislature eliminated the county option by repealing former section 14150.1 and enacting former section 14150. That section specified (by amount) each county\u2019s share of Medi-Cal costs for the 1972-1973 fiscal year and set forth a formula for increasing the share in subsequent years based on the taxable assessed value of certain property. (Stats. 1971, ch. 577, \u00a7\u00a7 41, 42, pp. 1131-1133.)</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">For the 1978-1979 fiscal year, the state assumed each county\u2019s share of Medi-Cal costs under former section 14150. (Stats. 1978, ch. 292, \u00a7 33, p. 610.) In July 1979, the Legislature repealed former section 14150 altogether, thereby eliminating the counties\u2019 responsibility to share in Medi-Cal costs. (Stats. 1979, ch. 282, \u00a7 74, p. 1043.) Thus, in November 1979, when the electorate adopted section 6, \u201cthe state was funding Medi-Cal coverage for [MIP\u2019s] without requiring any county financial contribution.\u201d (Kinlaw, <em>supra, </em>54 Cal.3d at p. 329.) The state continued to provide full funding for MIP medical care through 1982.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-7\">In 1982, the Legislature passed two Medi-Cal reform bills that, as of January 1, 1983, excluded from Medi-Cal most adults who had been eligible <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>under the MIP category (adult MIP\u2019s or Medically Indigent Adults).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> (Stats. 1982, ch. 328, \u00a7\u00a7 6, 8.3, 8.5, pp. 1574-1576; Stats. 1982, ch. 1594, \u00a7\u00a7 19, 86, pp. 6315, 6357; <em>Cooke </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1989) 213 Cal.App.3d 401, 411 [261 Cal.Rptr. 706] <em>(Cooke).) </em>As part of excluding this population <em>from </em>Medi-Cal, the Legislature created the Medically Indigent Services Account (MISA) as a mechanism for \u201ctransfer[ing] [state] funds to the counties for the provision of health care services.\u201d (Stats. 1982, ch. 1594, \u00a7 86, p. 6357.) Through MISA, the state annually allocated funds to counties based on \u201cthe average amount expended\u201d during the previous three fiscal years on MediCal services for county residents who had been eligible as MIP\u2019s. (Stats. 1982, ch. 1594, \u00a7 69, p. 6345.) The Legislature directed that MISA funds \u201cbe consolidated with existing county health services funds in order to provide health services to low-income persons and other persons not eligible for the Medi-Cal program.\u201d (Stats. 1982, ch. 1594, \u00a7 86, p. 6357.) It further provided: \u201cAny person whose income and resources meet the income and resource criteria for certification for [Medi-Cal] services pursuant to Section 14005.7 other than for the aged, blind, or disabled, shall not be excluded from eligibility for services to the extent that state funds are provided.\u201d (Stats. 1982, ch. 1594, \u00a7 70, p. 6346.)</p>\n<p id=\"b116-4\">After passage of the 1982 legislation, San Diego established a county medical services (CMS) program to provide medical care to adult MIP\u2019s. According to San Diego, between 1983 and June 1989, the state fully funded San Diego\u2019s CMS program through MISA. However, for fiscal years 1989-1990 and 1990-1991, the state only partially funded San Diego\u2019s CMS program. For example, San Diego asserts that, in fiscal year 1990-1991, it exhausted state-provided MISA funds by December 24, 1990. Faced with this shortfall, San Diego\u2019s board of supervisors voted in February 1991 to terminate the CMS program unless the state agreed by March 8 to provide full funding for the 1990-1991 fiscal year. After the state refused to provide additional funding, San Diego notified affected individuals and medical service providers that it would terminate the CMS program at midnight on March 19, 1991. The response to the County\u2019s notification ultimately resulted in the unfunded mandate claim now before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">II. Unfunded Mandates</p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">Through adoption of Proposition 13 in 1978, the voters added article XIII A to the California Constitution, which \u201cimposes a limit on the power of state and local governments to adopt and levy taxes. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(County of Fresno </em>v. <em>State of California </em>(1991) 53 Cal.3d 482, 486 [280 Cal.Rptr. 92, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>808 P.2d 235] <em>(County of Fresno).) </em>The next year, the voters added article XIII B to the Constitution, which \u201cimpose[s] a complementary limit on the rate of growth in governmental spending.\u201d <em>(San Francisco Taxpayers Assn. </em>v. <em>Board of Supervisors </em>(1992) 2 Cal.4th 571, 574 [7 Cal.Rptr.2d 245, 828 P.2d 147].)  These two constitutional articles \u201cwork in tandem, together restricting California governments\u2019 power both to levy and to spend for public purposes.\u201d <em>(City of Sacramento </em>v. <em>State of California </em>(1990) 50 Cal.3d 51, 59, fn. 1 [266 Cal.Rptr. 139, 785 P.2d 522].) Their goals are \u201cto protect residents from excessive taxation and government spending. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(County of Los Angeles </em>v. <em>State of California </em>(1987) 43 Cal.3d 46, 61 [233 Cal.Rptr. 38, 729 P.2d 202] <em>(County of Los Angeles).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b117-4\">Article XIII B of the California Constitution includes section 6, which is the constitutional provision at issue here. It provides in relevant part: \u201cWhenever the Legislature or any state agency mandates a new program or higher level of service on any local government, the state shall provide a subvention of funds to reimburse such local government for the costs of such program or increased level of service, except that the Legislature may, but need not, provide such subvention of funds for the following mandates: [\u00b6] . . . [\u00b6] (c) Legislative mandates enacted prior to January 1, 1975, or executive orders or regulations initially implementing legislation enacted prior to January 1, 1975.\u201d Section 6 recognizes that articles XIII A and XIIIB severely restrict the taxing and spending powers of local governments. <em>(County of Fresno, supra, </em>53 Cal.3d at p. 487.) Its purpose is to preclude the state from shifting financial responsibility for carrying out governmental functions to local agencies, which are \u201cill equipped\u201d to assume increased financial responsibilities because of the taxing and spending limitations that articles XIII A and XIII B impose. <em>(County of Fresno, supra, </em>53 Cal.3d at p. 487; <em>County of Los Angeles, supra, </em>43 Cal.3d at p. 61.) With certain exceptions, section 6 \u201c[essentially\u201d requires the state \u201cto pay for any new governmental programs, or for higher levels of service under existing programs, that it imposes upon local governmental agencies. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Hayes </em>v. <em>Commission on State Mandates </em>(1992) 11 Cal.App.4th 1564, 1577 [15 Cal.Rptr.2d 547].)</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">In 1984, the Legislature created a statutory procedure for determining whether a statute imposes state-mandated costs on a local agency within the meaning of section 6. (Gov. Code, \u00a7 17500 et seq.). The local agency must file a test claim with the Commission, which, after a public hearing, decides whether the statute mandates a new program or increased level of service. (Gov. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 17521, 17551, 17555.) If the Commission finds a claim to be reimbursable, it must determine the amount of reimbursement. (Gov. Code, \u00a7 17557.) The local agency must then follow certain statutory procedures to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>obtain reimbursement. (Gov. Code, \u00a7 17558 et seq.) If the Legislature refuses to appropriate money for a reimbursable mandate, the local agency may file \u201can action in declaratory relief to declare the mandate unenforceable and enjoin its enforcement.\u201d (Gov. Code, \u00a7 17612, subd. (c).) If the Commission finds no reimbursable mandate, the local agency may challenge this finding by administrative mandate proceedings under section 1094.5 of the Code of Civil Procedure. (Gov. Code, \u00a7 17559.) Government Code section 17552 declares that these provisions \u201cprovide the sole and exclusive procedure by which a local agency . . . may claim reimbursement for costs mandated by the state as required by Section <em>6</em></p>\n<p id=\"b118-4\">III. Administrative and Judicial Proceedings</p>\n<p id=\"AV\">A. <em>The Los Angeles Action</em></p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">On November 23, 1987, the County of Los Angeles (Los Angeles) filed a claim (the Los Angeles action) with the Commission asserting that the exclusion of adult MIP\u2019s from Medi-Cal constituted a reimbursable mandate under section 6. <em>(Kinlaw, supra, </em>54 Cal.3d at p. 330, fn. 2.) Alameda County subsequently filed a claim on November 30, 1987, but the Commission rejected it because of the pending Los Angeles claim. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 331, fn. 4.) Los Angeles refused to permit Alameda County to join as a claimant, but permitted San Bernardino County to join. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">In April 1989, the Commission rejected the Los Angeles claim, finding no reimbursable mandate.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>(Kinlaw, supra, </em>54 Cal.3d at p. 330, fn. 2.) <em>It </em>found that the 1982 legislation did not impose on counties a new program or a higher level of service for an existing program because counties had a \u201cpre-existing duty\u201d to provide medical care to the medically indigent under section 17000. TThat section provides in relevant part: \u201cEvery county . . . shall relieve and support all incompetent, poor, indigent persons . . . lawfully resident therein, when such persons are not supported and relieved by their relatives or friends, by their own means, or by state hospitals or other state or private institutions.\u201d Section 17000 did not impose a reimbursable mandate under section 6, the Commission further reasoned, because it \u201cwas enacted prior to January 1, 1975 . . . .\u201d Finally, the Commission found no mandate because the 1982 legislation \u201cneither established] the level of care to be provided nor . . . define[d] the class of persons determined to be eligible for medical care since these criteria were established by boards of supervisors\u201d pursuant to section 17001.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-7\">On March 20, 1990, the Los Angeles Superior Court filed a judgment reversing the Commission\u2019s decision and directing issuance of a peremptory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>writ of mandate. On April 16, 1990, the Commission and the state filed an appeal in the Second District Court of Appeal. <em>(County of Los Angeles </em>v. <em>State of California, </em>No. B049625.)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In early 1992, the parties to the Los Angeles action agreed to settle their dispute and to seek dismissal. In April 1992, after learning of this agreement, San Diego sought to intervene. Explaining that it had been waiting for resolution of the action, San Diego requested that the Court of Appeal deny the dismissal request and add (or substitute in) the County as a party. The Court of Appeal did not respond. On December 15, 1992, the parties to the Los Angeles action entered into a settlement agreement that provided for vacation of the superior court judgment and dismissal of the appeal and superior court action. Consistent with the settlement agreement, on December 29, 1992, the Court of Appeal filed an order vacating the superior court judgment, dismissing the appeal, and instructing the superior court to dismiss the action without prejudice on remand.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b119-4\">B. <em>The San Diego Action</em></p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">1. <em>Administrative Attempts to Obtain Reimbursement</em></p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">On March 13, 1991, San Diego submitted an invoice to the State Controller seeking reimbursement of its uncompensated expenditures on the CMS program for fiscal year 1989-1990. The Controller is a member of the Commission. (Gov. Code, \u00a7 17525.) On April 12, the Controller returned the invoice \u201cwithout action,\u201d stating that \u201c[n]o appropriation has been given to this office to allow for reimbursement\u201d of medical costs for adult MIP\u2019s, and noting that litigation was pending regarding the state\u2019s reimbursement obligation. On December 18, 1991, San Diego submitted a similar invoice for the 1990-1991 fiscal year. The state has not acted regarding this second invoice.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>2. <em>Court Proceedings</em></p>\n<p id=\"b120-4\">Responding to San Diego\u2019s notice of intent to terminate the CMS program, on March 11, 1991, the Legal Aid Society of San Diego filed a class action on behalf of CMS program beneficiaries seeking to enjoin termination of the program. The trial court later issued a preliminary injunction prohibiting San Diego \u201cfrom taking any action to reduce or terminate\u201d the CMS program.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">On March 15, 1991, San Diego filed a cross-complaint and petition for writ of mandate under Code of Civil Procedure section 1085 against the state, the Commission, and various state officers.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The cross-complaint alleged that, by excluding adult MIP\u2019s from Medi-Cal and transferring responsibility for their medical care to counties* the state had mandated a new program and higher level of service within the meaning of section 6. The cross-complaint further alleged that the state therefore had a duty under section 6 to reimburse San Diego for the entire cost of its CMS program, and that the state had failed to perform its duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">Proceeding from these initial allegations, the cross-complaint alleged causes of action for indeiimification, declaratory and injunctive relief, reimbursement and damages, and writ of mandate. In its first declaratory relief claim, San Diego alleged (on information and belief) that the state contended the CMS program was a nonreimbursable, county obligation. In its claim for reimbursement, San Diego alleged (again on information and belief) that the Commission had \u201cpreviously denied the claims of other counties, ruling that county medical care programs for [adult MIP\u2019s] are not state-mandated and, therefore, counties are not entitled to reimbursement from the State for the costs of such programs.\u201d \u201cUnder these circumstances,\u201d San Diego asserted, \u201cdenial of the County\u2019s claim by the Commission . . . is virtually certain and further administrative pursuit of this claim would be a futile act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b120-7\">For relief, San Diego requested a judgment declaring the following: (1) that the state must fully reimburse San Diego if it \u201cis compelled to provide any CMS Program services to plaintiffs . . . after March 19, 1991\u201d; (2) that section 6 requires the state \u201cto fully fund the CMS Program\u201d (or, alternatively, that the CMS program is discretionary); (3) that the state must pay San Diego for all of its unreimbursed costs for the CMS program during <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>the 1989-1990 and 1990-1991 fiscal years; and (4) that the state shall assume responsibility for operating any court-ordered continuation of the CMS program. San Diego also requested that the court issue a writ of mandamus requiring the state to fulfill its reimbursement obligation. Finally, San Diego requested issuance of preliminary and permanent injunctions to ensure that the state fulfilled its obligations to the County.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-4\">In April 1991, San Diego determined that it could continue operating the CMS program using previously unavailable general fund revenues. Accordingly, San Diego and plaintiffs settled their dispute, and plaintiffs dismissed their complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">The matter proceeded solely on San Diego\u2019s cross-complaint. The court issued a preliminary injunction and alternative writ in May 1991. At a hearing on June 25, 1991, the court found that the state had an obligation to fund San Diego\u2019s CMS program, granted San Diego\u2019s request for a writ of mandate, and scheduled an evidentiary hearing to determine damages and remedies. On July 1, 1991, it issued an order reflecting this ruling and granting a peremptory writ of mandate. The writ did not issue, however, because of the pending hearing to determine damages. In December 1992, after an extensive evidentiary hearing and posthearing proceedings on the claim for a peremptory writ of mandate, the court issued a judgment confirming its jurisdiction to determine San Diego\u2019s claim, finding that section 6 required the state to fund the entire cost of San Diego\u2019s CMS program, determining the amount that the state owed San Diego for fiscal years 1989-1990 and 1990-1991, identifying funds available to the state to satisfy the judgment, and ordering issuance of a peremptory writ of mandate.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The court also issued a peremptory writ of mandate directing the state and various state officers to comply with the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">The Court of Appeal affirmed the judgment insofar as it provided that section 6 requires the state to fund the CMS program. The Court of Appeal also affirmed the trial court\u2019s finding that the state had required San Diego to spend at least $41 million on the CMS program in fiscal years 1989-1990 and 1990-1991. However, the Court of Appeal reversed those portions of the judgment determining the final reimbursement amount and specifying the state funds from which the state was to satisfy the judgment. It remanded the matter to the Commission to determine the reimbursement amount and appropriate statutory remedies. We then granted the state\u2019s petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-7\">IV. Superior Court Jurisdiction</p>\n<p id=\"b121-8\">Before reaching the merits of the appeal, we must address the state\u2019s assertion that the superior court lacked jurisdiction to hear San <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>Diego\u2019s mandate claim. According to the state, in <em>Kinlaw, supra, </em>54 Cal.3d 326, we \u201cunequivocally held that the orderly determination of [unfunded] mandate questions demands that only one claim on any particular alleged mandate be entertained by the courts at any given time.\u201d Thus, if a test claim is pending, \u201cother potential claims must be held in abeyance . . . .\u201d Applying this principle, the state asserts that, since \u201cthe test claim litigation was pending\u201d in the Los Angeles action when San Diego filed its cross-complaint seeking mandamus relief, \u201cthe superior court lacked jurisdiction from the outset, and the resulting judgment is a nullity. That defect cannot be cured by the settlement of the test claim, which occurred after judgment was entered herein.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b122-4\">In <em>Kinlaw, </em>we held that individual taxpayers and recipients of government benefits lack standing to enforce section 6 because the applicable administrative procedures, which \u201care the exclusive means\u201d for determining and enforcing the state\u2019s section 6 obligations, \u201care available only to local agencies and school districts directly affected by a state mandate . . . .\u201d <em>(Kinlaw, supra, </em>54 Cal.3d at p. 328.) In reaching this conclusion, we explained that the reimbursement right under section 6 \u201cis a right given by the Constitution to local agencies, not individuals either as taxpayers or recipients of government benefits and services.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 334.) We concluded that \u201c[njeither public policy nor practical necessity compels creation of a judicial remedy by which individuals may enforce the right of the county to such revenues.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 335.)</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">In finding that individuals do not have standing to enforce the section 6 rights of local agencies, we made several observations in <em>Kinlaw </em>pertinent to operation of the statutory process as it applies to entities that do have standing. Citing Government Code section 17500, we explained that \u201cthe Legislature enacted comprehensive administrative procedures for resolution of claims arising out of section 6 . . . because the absence of a uniform procedure had resulted in inconsistent rulings on the existence of state mandates, unnecessary litigation, reimbursement delays, and, apparently, resultant uncertainties in accommodating reimbursement requirements in the budgetary process.\u201d <em>(Kinlaw, supra, </em>54 Cal.3d at p. 331.) Thus, the governing statutes \u201cestablish[] procedures which exist for the express purpose of avoiding multiple proceedings, judicial and administrative, addressing the same claim that a reimbursable state mandate has been created.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 333.) Specifically, \u201c[t]he legislation establishes a test-claim procedure to expeditiously resolve disputes affecting multiple agencies . . . .\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 331.) Describing the Commission\u2019s application of the test-claim procedure to claims regarding exclusion of adult MIP\u2019s from Medi-Cal, we observed: \u201cThe test claim by the County of Los Angeles was filed prior to that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>proposed by Alameda County. The Alameda County claim was rejected for that reason. (See [Gov. Code,] \u00a7 17521.) Los Angeles County permitted San Bernardino County to join in its claim which the Commission accepted as a test claim intended to resolve the [adult MIP exclusion] issues .... Los Angeles County declined a request from Alameda County that it be included in the test claim . . . .\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 331, fn. 4.)</p>\n<p id=\"b123-4\">Consistent with our observations in <em>Kinlaw, </em>we here agree with the state that the trial court should not have proceeded to resolve San Diego\u2019s claim for reimbursement under section 6 while the Los Angeles action was pending. A contrary conclusion would undermine one of \u201cthe express purpose[s]\u201d of the statutory procedure: to \u201cavoid[] multiple proceedings . . . addressing the same claim that a reimbursable state mandate has been created.\u201d <em>(Kinlaw, supra, </em>54 Cal.3d at p. 333.)</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">However, we reject the state\u2019s assertion that the error was jurisdictional. The power of superior courts to perform mandamus review of administrative decisions derives in part from article VI, section 10 of the California Constitution. <em>(Bixby </em>v. <em>Pierno </em>(1971) 4 Cal.3d 130, 138 [93 Cal.Rptr. 234, 481 P.2d 242]; <em>Lipari </em>v. <em>Department of Motor Vehicles </em>(1993) 16 Cal.App.4th 667, 672 [20 Cal.Rptr.2d 246].) That section gives \u201c[t]he Supreme Court, courts of appeal, [and] superior courts . . . original jurisdiction in proceedings for extraordinary relief in the nature of mandamus ....\u2019\u2019 (Cal. Const., art. VI, \u00a7 10.) \u201cThe jurisdiction thus vested may not lightly be deemed to have been destroyed.\u201d <em>(Garrison </em>v. <em>Rourke </em>(1948) 32 Cal.2d 430, 435 [196 P.2d 884], overruled on another ground in <em>Keane </em>v. <em>Smith </em>(1971) 4 Cal.3d 932, 939 [95 Cal.Rptr. 197, 485 P.2d 261].) \u201cWhile the courts are subject to reasonable statutory regulation of procedure and other matters, they will maintain their constitutional powers in order effectively to function as a separate department of government. [Citations.] Consequently an intent to defeat the exercise of the court\u2019s jurisdiction will not be supplied by implication.\u201d <em>(Garrison, supra, </em>at p. 436.)  Here, we find no statutory provision that either \u201cexpressly provide[s]\u201d <em>(id. </em>at p. 435) or otherwise \u201cclearly indicate[s]\u201d <em>(id. </em>at p. 436) that the Legislature intended to divest all courts other than the court hearing the test claim of their mandamus jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">Rather, following <em>Dowdall </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1920) 183 Cal. 348 [191 P. 685] <em>(Dowdall), </em>we interpret the governing statutes as simply vesting primary jurisdiction in the court hearing the test claim. In <em>Dowdall, </em>we determined the jurisdictional effect of Code of Civil Procedure former section 1699 on actions to settle the account of trustees of a testamentary trust. Code of Civil Procedure former section 1699 provided in part: \u201cWhere any trust <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>has been created by or under any will to continue after distribution, the Superior Court shall not lose jurisdiction of the estate by final distribution, but shall retain jurisdiction thereof for the purpose of the settlement of accounts under the trust.\u201d (Stats. 1889, ch. 228, \u00a7 1, p. 337.) We explained that, under this section, \u201cthe superior court, sitting in probate upon the distribution of an estate wherein the will creates a trust, retain[ed] jurisdiction of the estate for the purpose of the settlement of the accounts under the trust.\u201d <em>(Dowdall, supra, </em>183 Cal. at p. 353.) However, we further observed that \u201cthe superior court of each county in the state has general jurisdiction in equity to settle trustees\u2019 accounts and to entertain actions for injunctions. This jurisdiction is, in a sense, concurrent with that of the superior court, which, by virtue of the decree of distribution, has jurisdiction of a trust created by will. The latter, however, is the primary jurisdiction, and if a bill in equity is filed in any other superior court for the purpose of settling the account of such trustee, that court, upon being informed of the jurisdiction of the court in probate and that an account is to be or has been filed therein for settlement, should postpone the proceeding in its own case and allow the account to be settled by the court having primary jurisdiction thereof.\u201d <em>{Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b124-4\">Similarly, we conclude that, under the statutes governing determination of unfunded mandate claims, the court hearing the test claim has primary jurisdiction. Thus, if an action asserting the same unfunded mandate claim is filed in any other superior court, that court, upon being informed of the pending test claim, should postpone the proceeding before it and allow the court having primary jurisdiction to determine the test claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">However, a court\u2019s erroneous refusal to stay further proceedings does not render those further proceedings void for lack of jurisdiction. As we explained in <em>Dowdall, </em>a court that refuses to defer to another court\u2019s primary jurisdiction \u201cis not without jurisdiction.\u201d <em>(Dowdall, supra, </em>183 Cal. at p. 353.) Accordingly, notwithstanding pendency of the Los Angeles action, the trial court here did not lack jurisdiction to determine San Diego\u2019s mandamus petition. (See <em>Collins </em>v. <em>Ramish </em>(1920) 182 Cal. 360, 366-369 [188 P. 550] [although trial court erred in refusing to abate action because of former action pending, new trial was not warranted on issues that the trial court correctly decided]; <em>People </em>ex rel. <em>Garamendi </em>v. <em>American Autoplan, Inc. </em>(1993) 20 Cal.App.4th 760, 772 [25 Cal.Rptr.2d 192] <em>(Garamendi) </em>[\u201crule of exclusive concurrent jurisdiction is not \u2018jurisdictional\u2019 in the sense that failure to comply renders subsequent proceedings void\u201d]; <em>Stearns </em>v. <em>Los Angeles City School Dist. </em>(1966) 244 Cal.App.2d 696, 718 [53 Cal.Rptr. 482, 21 A.L.R.3d 164] [where trial court errs in failing to stay proceedings in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>deference to jurisdiction of another court, reversal would be frivolous absent errors regarding the merits].)<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b125-4\">The trial court\u2019s failure to defer to the primary jurisdiction of the court hearing the Los Angeles action did not prejudice the state. Contrary to the state\u2019s assertion, the trial court did not \u201cusurp\u201d the Commission\u2019s \u201cauthority to determine, in the first place, whether or not legislation creates a mandate.\u201d The Commission had already exercised that authority in the Los Angeles action. Moreover, given the settlement of the Los Angeles action, which included vacating the judgment in that action, the trial court\u2019s exercise of jurisdiction here did not result in one of the principal harms that the statutory procedure seeks to prevent: multiple decisions regarding an unfunded mandate question. Finally, the lack of an administrative record specifically relating to San Diego\u2019s claim did not prejudice the state because the threshold determination of whether a statute imposes a state mandate is an issue of law. <em>(County of Fresno </em>v. <em>Lehman </em>(1991) 229 Cal.App.3d 340, 347 [280 Cal.Rptr. 310].) To the extent that an administrative record was necessary, the record developed in the Los Angeles action could have been submitted to the trial court.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> (See <em>Los Angeles Unified School Dist. </em>v. <em>State of California </em>(1988) 199 Cal.App.3d 686, 689 [245 Cal.Rptr. 140].)</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">We also find that, on the facts of this case, San Diego\u2019s failure to submit a test claim to the Commission before seeking judicial relief did not affect the superior court\u2019s jurisdiction. Ordinarily, counties seeking to pursue an unfunded mandate claim under section 6 must exhaust their administrative remedies. <em>(Central Delta Water Agency </em>v. <em>State Water Resources Control Bd. </em>(1993) 17 Cal.App.4th 621, 641 [21 Cal.Rptr.2d 453]; <em>County of Contra Costa </em>v. <em>State of California </em>(1986) 177 Cal.App.3d 62, 73-77 [222 Cal.Rptr. 750] <em>(County of Contra Costa).) </em>However, counties may pursue section 6 claims in superior court without first resorting to administrative remedies if they \u201ccan establish an exception to\u201d the exhaustion requirement. <em>(County of Contra Costa, supra, 177 </em>Cal.App.3d at p. 77.) The futility exception to the exhaustion requirement applies if a county can \u201cstate with assurance that the [Commission] would rule adversely in its own particular case. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Lindeleaf </em>v. <em>Agricultural Labor Relations Bd. </em>(1986) 41 Cal.3d 861, 870 [226 Cal.Rptr. 119, 718 P.2d 106]; see also <em>County of Contra Costa, supra, 177 </em>Cal.App.3d at pp. 77-78.)</p>\n<p id=\"b126-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>We agree with the trial court and the Court of Appeal that the futility exception applied in this case. As we have previously noted, San Diego invoked this exception by alleging in its cross-complaint that the Commission\u2019s denial of its claim was \u201cvirtually certain\u201d because the Commission had \u201cpreviously denied the claims of other counties, ruling that county medical care programs for [adult MIP\u2019s] are not state-mandated and, therefore, counties are not entitled to reimbursement . . . .\u201d Given that the Commission rejected the Los Angeles claim (which alleged the same unfunded mandate claim that San Diego alleged) and appealed the judicial reversal of its decision, the trial court correctly determined that further attempts to seek relief from the Commission would have been futile. Therefore, we reject the state\u2019s jurisdictional argument and proceed to the merits of the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-4\">V. Existence of a Mandate Under Section 6</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">In determining whether there is a mandate under section 6, we turn to our decision in <em>Lucia Mar Unified School Dist. </em>v. <em>Honig </em>(1988) 44 Cal.3d 830 [244 Cal.Rptr. 677, 750 P.2d 318] <em>(Lucia Mar). </em>There, we discussed section 6\u2019s application to Education Code section 59300, which \u201crequires a school district to contribute part of the cost of educating pupils from the district at state schools for the severely handicapped.\u201d <em>(Lucia Mar, supra, </em>at p. 832.) Before 1979, the Legislature had statutorily required school districts \u201cto contribute to the education of pupils from the districts at the state schools [citations] . . . .\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 832-833.) The Legislature repealed the statutory requirements in 1979 and, on July 12, 1979, the state assumed full-funding responsibility. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 833.) On July 1, 1980, when section 6 became effective, the state still had full-funding responsibility. On June 28, 1981, Education Code section 59300 took effect. <em>(Lucia Mar, supra, </em>at p. 833.)</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">Various school districts filed a claim seeking reimbursement under section 6 for the payments that Education Code section 59300 requires. The Commission denied the claim, finding that the statute did not impose on the districts a new program or higher level of service. The trial court and Court of Appeal agreed, the latter \u201creasoning that a shift in the funding of an existing program is not a new program or a higher level of service\u201d under section 6. <em>(Lucia Mar, supra, </em>44 Cal.3d at p. 834.)</p>\n<p id=\"b126-7\">We reversed, finding that a contrary result would \u201cviolate the intent underlying section <em>6 ... .\u201d (Lucia Mar, supra, </em>44 Cal.3d at p. 835.) That section \u201cwas intended to preclude the state from shifting to local agencies the financial responsibility for providing public services in view of the[] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>restrictions on the taxing and spending power of the local entities\u201d that articles XIII A and XIII B of the California Constitution imposed. <em>(Lucia Mar, supra, </em>at pp. 835-836.) \u201cThe intent of the section would plainly be violated if the state could, while retaining administrative control of programs it has supported with state tax money, simply shift the cost of the programs to local government on the theory that the shift does not violate section 6 . . . because the programs are not \u2018new.\u2019 Whether the shifting of costs is accomplished by compelling local governments to pay the cost of entirely new programs created by the state, <em>or by compelling them to accept financial responsibility in whole or in part for a program which was funded entirely by the state before the advent of article XIIIB, </em>the result seems equally violative of the fundamental purpose underlying section 6 . . . .\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 836, italics added, fh. omitted.) We thus concluded in <em>Lucia Mar </em>\u201cthat because [Education Code] section 59300 shifts partial financial responsibility for the support of students in the state-operated schools from the state to school districts\u2014an obligation the school districts did not have at the time article XIII B was adopted\u2014it calls for [the school districts] to support a \u2018new program\u2019 within the meaning of section 6.\u201d <em>(Ibid., </em>fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b127-4\">The similarities between <em>Lucia Mar </em>and the case before us \u201care striking. In <em>Lucia Mar, </em>prior to 1979 the state and county shared the cost of educating handicapped children in state schools; in the present case from 1971-197[8] the state and county shared the cost of caring for [adult MIP\u2019s] under the Medi-Cal program. . . . [F]ollowing enactment of [article XIII A], the state took full responsibility for both programs.\u201d <em>(Kinlaw, supra, </em>54 Cal.3d at p. 353 (dis. opn. of Broussard, J.).) As to both programs, the Legislature cited adoption of article XIII A of the California Constitution, and specifically its effect on tax revenues, as the basis for the state\u2019s assumption of full funding responsibility. (Stats. 1979, ch. 237, \u00a7 10, p. 493; Stats. 1979, ch. 282, \u00a7 106, p. 1059.) \u201cThen in 1981 (for handicapped children) and 1982 (for [adult MIP\u2019s]), the state sought to shift some of the burden back to the counties.\u201d <em>(Kinlaw, supra, </em>54 Cal.3d at p. 353 (dis. opn. of Broussard, J.).)</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">Adopting the Commission\u2019s analysis in the Los Angeles action, the state nevertheless argues that <em>Lucia Mar </em>\u201cis inapposite.\u201d The school program at issue in <em>Lucia Mar </em>\u201chad been wholly operated, administered and financed by the state\u201d and \u201cwas unquestionably a \u2018state program.\u2019 \u201d \u201c \u2018In contrast,\u2019 \u201d the state argues, \u201c \u2018the program here has never been operated or administered by the State of California. The counties have always borne legal and financial responsibility for\u2019 \u201d it under section 17000 and its predecessors.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The courts have interpreted section 17000 as \u201cimpos[ing] upon counties a duty to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>provide hospital and medical services to indigent residents. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Board of Supervisors </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1989) 207 Cal.App.3d 552, 557 [254 Cal.Rptr. 905].) Thus, the state argues, the source of San Diego\u2019s obligation to provide medical care to adult MIP\u2019s is section 17000, not the 1982 legislation. Moreover, because the Legislature enacted section 17000 in 1965, and section 6 does not apply to \u201cmandates enacted prior to January 1, 1975,\u201d there is no reimbursable mandate. Finally, the state argues that, because section 17001 give counties \u201ccomplete discretion\u201d in setting eligibility and service standards under section 17000, there is no mandate. A contrary conclusion, the state asserts, \u201cwould erroneously expand the definition of what constitutes a \u2018new program\u2019 under\u201d section 6. As we explain, we reject these arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-4\">A. <em>The Source and Existence of San Diego\u2019s Obligation</em></p>\n<p id=\"AFJ\">1. <em>The Residual Nature of the Counties\u2019 Duty Under Section 17000</em></p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">The state\u2019s argument that San Diego\u2019s obligation to provide medical care to adult MIP\u2019s predates the 1982 legislation contains numerous errors. First, the state misunderstands San Diego\u2019s obligation under section 17000. That section creates \u201cthe <em>residual </em>fund\u201d to sustain indigents \u201cwho cannot qualify . . . under any specialized aid programs.\u201d <em>(Mooney, </em>supra, 4 Cal.3d at p. 681, italics added; see also <em>Board of Supervisors </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>207 Cal.App.3d at p. 562; <em>Boehm </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1986) 178 Cal.App.3d 494, 499 [223 Cal.Rptr. 716] [general assistance \u201cis a program of last resort\u201d].) By its express terms, the statute requires a county to relieve and support indigent persons <em>only </em>\u201cwhen such persons are not supported and relieved by their relatives or friends, by their own means, or by state hospitals or other state or private institutions.\u201d (\u00a7 17000.)<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> \u201cConsequently, to the extent that the state or federal governments provide[d] care for [adult MIP\u2019s], the [C]ounty\u2019s obligation to do so [was] reduced . . . .\u201d <em>(Kinlaw, supra, </em>54 Cal.3d at p. 354, fn. 14 (dis. opn. of Broussard, J.).)<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">As we have explained, the state began providing adult MIP\u2019s with medical care under Medi-Cal in 1971. Although it initially required counties to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>contribute generally to the costs of Medi-Cal, it did not set forth a specific amount for coverage of MIP\u2019s. The state was primarily responsible for the costs of the program, and the counties were simply required to contribute funds to defray the state\u2019s costs. Beginning with the 1978-1979 fiscal year, the state paid all costs of the Medi-Cal program, including the cost of medical care for adult MIP\u2019s. Thus, when section 6 was adopted in November 1979, to the extent that Medi-Cal provided medical care to adult MIP\u2019s, San Diego bore no financial responsibility for these health care costs.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b129-4\">The California Attorney General has expressed a similar understanding of Medi-Cal\u2019s effect on the counties\u2019 medical care responsibility under section 17000. After the 1971 extension of Medi-Cal coverage to MIP\u2019s, Fresno County sought an opinion regarding the scope of its duty to provide medical care under section 17000. It asserted that the 1971 repeal of former section 14108.5, which declared the Legislature\u2019s concern with the counties\u2019 problems in caring for indigents not eligible for Medi-Cal, evidenced a legislative intent to preempt the field of providing health services. (56 Ops.Cal.Atty.Gen., <em>supra, </em>at p. 571.) The Attorney General disagreed, concluding that the 1971 change \u201cdid not alter the duty of the counties to provide medical care to those indigents not eligible for Medi-Cal.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 569.) The Attorney General explained: \u201cThe statement of concern acknowledged the obligation of counties to continue to provide medical assistance under section 17000; the removal of the statement of concern was not accompanied by elimination of such duty on the part of the counties, <em>except as the addition of [MIP\u2019s] to the Medi-Cal program would remove the burden on the counties to provide medical care for such </em>persons.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 571, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b130-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>Indeed, the Legislature\u2019s statement of intent in an uncodified section of the 1982 legislation excluding adult MIP\u2019s from Medi-Cal suggests that it also shared our understanding of section 17000. Section 8.3 of the 1982 Medi-Cal revisions expressly declared the Legislature\u2019s intent \u201c[i]n eliminating [M]edically [I]ndigent [A]dults from the Medi-Cal program . . . .\u201d (Stats. 1982, ch. 328, \u00a7 8.3, p. 1575; Stats. 1982, ch. 1594, \u00a7 86, p. 6357.) It stated in part: \u201cIt is further the intent of the Legislature to provide counties with as much flexibility as possible in organizing county health services to serve <em>the population being </em>transferred.\u201d (Stats. 1982, ch. 328, \u00a7 8.3, p. 1576; Stats. 1982, ch. 1594, \u00a7 86, p. 6357, italics added.) If, as the state contends, counties had always been responsible under section 17000 for the medical care of adult MIP\u2019s, the description of adult MIP\u2019s as \u201cthe population being transferred\u201d would have been inaccurate. By so describing adult MIP\u2019s, the Legislature indicated its understanding that counties did not have this responsibility while adult MIP\u2019s were eligible for Medi-Cal. These sources fully support our rejection of the state\u2019s argument that the 1982 legislation did not impose a mandate because, under section 17000, counties had always borne the responsibility for providing medical care to adult MIP\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-4\">2. <em>The State\u2019s Assumption of Full Funding Responsibility for Providing Medical Care to Adult MIP\u2019s Under Medi-Cal</em></p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">To support its argument that it never relieved counties of their obligation under section 17000 to provide medical care to adult MIP\u2019s, the state characterizes as \u201ctemporary\u201d the Legislature\u2019s assumption of full-funding responsibility for adult MIP\u2019s. According to the state, \u201cany ongoing responsibility of the county was, at best, only temporarily, partially, alleviated (and never supplanted).\u201d The state asserts that the Court of Appeal thus \u201cerred by focusing on one phase in th[e] shifting pattern of arrangements\u201d for funding indigent health care, \u201ca focus which led to a myopic conclusion that the state alone is forever responsible for funding the health care for\u201d adult MIP\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">A comparison of the 1978 and 1979 statutes that eliminated the counties\u2019 share of Medi-Cal costs refutes the state\u2019s claim. The Legislature expressly limited the effect of the 1978 legislation to one fiscal year, providing that the state \u201cshall pay\u201d each county\u2019s Medi-Cal cost share \u201cfor the period from July 1, 1978, to June 30, 1979.\u201d (Stats. 1978, ch. 292, \u00a7 33, p. 610.) The Legislative Counsel\u2019s Digest explained that this section would require the state to pay \u201c[a]ll county costs for Medi-Cal\u201d for \u201cthe 1978-79 fiscal year only.\u201d (Legis. Counsel\u2019s Dig., Sen. Bill No. 154, 4 Stats. 1978 (Reg. Sess.), Summary Dig., p. 71.) The digest further explained that the purpose of the bill containing this section was \u201cthe <em>partial </em>relief of local government from the <em>temporary </em>difficulties brought about by the approval of Proposition 13.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number><em>(Id. </em>at p. 70, italics added.) Clearly, the Legislature knew how to include words of limitation when it intended the effects of its provisions to be temporary.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-4\">By contrast, the 1979 legislation contains no such limiting language. It simply provided: \u201cSection 14150 of the Welfare and Institutions Code is repealed.\u201d (Stats. 1979, ch. 282, \u00a7 74, p. 1043.) In setting forth the need to enact the legislation as an urgency statute, the Legislature explained: \u201cThe adoption of Article XIII A . . . may cause the curtailment or elimination of programs and services which are vital to the state\u2019s public health, safety, education, and welfare. In order that such services not be interrupted, it is necessary that this act take effect immediately.\u201d (Stats. 1979, ch. 282, \u00a7 106, p. 1059.) In describing the effect of this legislation, the Legislative Counsel first explained that, \u201c[u]nder existing law, the counties pay a specified annual share of the cost of\u2019 Medi-Cal. (Legis. Counsel\u2019s Dig., Assem. Bill No. 8, 4 Stats. 1979 (Reg. Sess.), Summary Dig., p. 79.) Referring to the 1978 legislation, it further explained that \u201c[f|or the 1978-79 fiscal year only, the state pays . . . HD . . . [a]ll county costs for Medi-Cal . . . .\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>The 1979 legislation, the digest continued, \u201cprovid[ed] for state assumption of all county costs of Medi-Cal.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>We find nothing in the 1979 legislation or the Legislative Counsel\u2019s summary indicating a legislative intent to eliminate the counties\u2019 cost share of Medi-Cal only temporarily.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">The state budget process for the 1980r 1981 fiscal year confirms that the Legislature\u2019s assumption of all Medi-Cal costs was not viewed as \u201ctemporary.\u201d In the summary of his proposed budget, then Governor Brown described Assembly Bill No. 8, 1981-1982 Regular Session, generally as \u201ca long-term local financing measure\u201d (Governor\u2019s Budget for 1980-1981 as submitted to Legislature (1979-1980 Reg. Sess.) Summary of Local Government Fiscal Relief, p. A-30) through which \u201c[t]he total cost of [the MediCal] program was <em>permanently </em>assumed by the State . . . .\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. A-32, italics added.) Similarly, in describing to the Joint Legislative Budget Committee the Medi-Cal funding item in the proposed budget, the Legislative Analyst explained: \u201cItem 287 includes the state cost of \u2018buying out\u2019 the county share of Medi-Cal expenditures. Following passage of Proposition 13, [Senate Bill No.] 154 appropriated $418 million to relieve counties of all fiscal responsibility for Medi-Cal program costs. Subsequently, [Assembly Bill No.] 8 was enacted, <em>which made permanent state assumption of county Medi-Cal costs.\u201d </em>(Legis. Analyst, Rep. to Joint Legis. Budget Com., Analysis of 1980-1981 Budget Bill, Assem. Bill No. 2020 (1979-1980 Reg. Sess.) at p. 721, italics added.) Thus, the state errs in asserting that the 1979 legislation eliminated the counties\u2019 financial support of Medi-Cal \u201conly temporarily.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b132-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>3. <em>State Administration of Medical Care for Adult MIP\u2019s Under Medi-Cal</em></p>\n<p id=\"b132-4\">The state argues that, unlike the school program before us in <em>Lucia Mar, supra, </em>44 Cal.3d 830, which \u201chad been wholly operated, administered and financed by the state,\u201d the program for providing medical care to adult MIP\u2019s \u201c \u2018has never been operated or administered by\u2019 \u201d the state. According to the state, Medi-Cal was simply a state \u201creimbursement program\u201d for care that section 17000 required counties to provide. The state is incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">One of the legislative goals of Medi-Cal was \u201cto allow eligible persons to secure basic health care in the same manner employed by the public generally, and without discrimination or segregation based purely on their economic disability.\u201d (Stats. 1966, Second Ex. Sess. 1965, ch. 4, \u00a7 2, p. 104.) \u201cIn effect, this meant that poorer people could have access to a private practitioner of their choice, and not be relegated to a county hospital program.\u201d <em>(California Medical Assn. </em>v. <em>Brian </em>(1973) 30 Cal.App.3d 637, 642 [106 Cal.Rptr. 555].) Medi-Cal \u201cprovided for reimbursement to both public and private health care providers for medical services rendered.\u201d <em>(Lackner, supra, </em>97 Cal.App.3d at p. 581.) It further directed that, \u201c[i]nsofar as practical,\u201d public assistance recipients be afforded \u201cfree choice of arrangements under which they shall receive basic health care.\u201d (Stats. 1966, Second Ex. Sess. 1965, ch. 4, \u00a7 2, p. 115.) Finally, since its inception, Medi-Cal has permitted county boards of supervisors to \u201cprescribe rules which authorize the county hospital to integrate its services with those of other hospitals into a system of community service which offers free choice of hospitals to those requiring hospital care. The intent of this section is to eliminate discrimination or segregation based on economic disability so that the county hospital and other hospitals in the community share in providing services to paying patients and to those who qualify for care in public medical care programs.\u201d (\u00a7 14000.2.) Thus, \u201cMedi-Cal eligibles were to be able to secure health care in the same manner employed by the general public (i.e., in the private sector or at a county facility).\u201d (1974 Legis. Analyst\u2019s Rep., <em>supra, </em>at p. 625; see also Preliminary Rep., <em>supra, </em>at p. 17.) By allowing eligible persons \u201ca choice of medical facilities for treatment,\u201d Medi-Cal placed county health care providers \u201cin competition with private hospitals.\u201d <em>(Hall, supra, </em>23 Cal.App.3d at p. 1061.)</p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">Moreover, administration of Medi-Cal over the years has been the responsibility of various state departments and agencies. (\u00a7\u00a7 10720-10721, 14061-14062, 14105, 14203; <em>Belsh\u00e9, supra, </em>13 Cal.4th at p. 751; <em>Morris, supra, </em>67 Cal.2d at p. 741; Summary of Major Events, <em>supra, </em>at pp. 2-3, 15.) Thus, \u201c[i]n adopting the Medi-Cal program the state Legislature, for the most part, shifted indigent medical care from being a county responsibility to a State <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>responsibility under the Medi-Cal program. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Bay General Community Hospital </em>v. <em>County of San Diego </em>(1984) 156 Cal.App.3d 944, 959 [203 Cal.Rptr. 184] <em>(Bay General); </em>see also Preliminary Rep., <em>supra, </em>at p. 18 [with certain exceptions, Medi-Cal \u201cshifted to the state\u201d the responsibility for administration of the medical care provided to eligible persons].) We therefore reject the state\u2019s assertion that, while Medi-Cal covered adult MIP\u2019s, county facilities were the sole providers of their medical care, and counties both operated and administered the program that provided that care.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-4\">The circumstances we have discussed readily distinguish this case from <em>County of Los Angeles </em>v. <em>Commission on State Mandates </em>(1995) 32 Cal.App.4th 805 [38 Cal.Rptr.2d 304], on which the state relies. There, the court rejected the claim that Penal Code section 987.9, which required counties to provide criminal defendants with certain defense funds, imposed an unfunded state mandate. Los Angeles filed the claim after the state, which had enacted appropriations between 1977 and 1990 \u201cto reimburse counties for their costs under\u201d the statute, made no appropriation for the 1990-1991 fiscal year. <em>(County of Los Angeles </em>v. <em>Commission on State Mandates, supra, </em>at p. 812.) In rejecting the claim, the court first held that there was no state mandate because Penal Code section 987.9 merely implemented the requirements of federal law. <em>(County of Los Angeles </em>v. <em>Commission on State Mandates, supra, </em>at pp. 814-816.) Thus, the court stated, \u201c[a]ssuming, arguendo, the provisions of [Penal Code] section 987.9 [constituted] a new program\u201d under section 6, there was no state mandate. <em>(County of Los Angeles </em>v. <em>Commission on State Mandates, supra, </em>at p. 818.) Here, of course, it is unquestionably the state that has required San Diego to provide medical care to indigent persons.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">In dictum, the court also rejected the argument that, under <em>Lucia Mar, supra, </em>44 Cal.3d 830, the state\u2019s \u201cdecision not to reimburse the counties for their programs under [Penal Code] section 987.9\u201d imposed a new program by shifting financial responsibility for the program to counties. <em>(County of Los Angeles </em>v. <em>Commission on State Mandates, supra, </em>32 Cal.App.4th at p. 817.) The court explained: \u201cIn contrast [to <em>Lucia Mar], </em>the program here has never been operated or administered by the State of California. The counties have always borne legal and financial responsibility for implementing the procedures under [Penal Code] section 987.9. The state merely reimbursed counties for specific expenses incurred by the counties in their operation of a program for which they had a primary legal and financial responsibility.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>Here, as we have explained, between 1971 and 1983, the state administered and bore financial responsibility for the medical care that adult MIP\u2019s received under Medi-Cal. The Medi-Cal program was not simply a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>method of reimbursement for county costs. Thus, the state\u2019s reliance on this dictum is misplaced.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b134-4\">In summary, our discussion demonstrates the Legislature excluded adult MIP\u2019s from Medi-Cal <em>knowing </em>and <em>intending </em>that the 1982 legislation would trigger the counties\u2019 responsibility to provide medical care as providers of last resort under section 17000. Thus, through the 1982 legislation, the Legislature attempted to do precisely that which the voters enacted section 6 to prevent; \u201ctransfer[] to [counties] the fiscal responsibility for providing services which the state believed should be extended to the public.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> <em>(County of Los Angeles, supra, </em>43 Cal.3d at p. 56; see also <em>City of Sacramento </em>v. <em>State of California, supra, </em>50 Cal.3d at p. 68 [A \u201ccentral purpose\u201d of section 6 was \u201cto prevent the state\u2019s transfer of the <em>cost of government </em>from <em>itself </em>to the local level.\u201d].) Accordingly, we view the 1982 legislation as having mandated a \u201c \u2018new program\u2019 \u201d on counties by \u201ccompelling them to accept financial responsibility in whole or in part for a program,\u201d i.e., medical care for adult MIP\u2019s, \u201cwhich was funded entirely by the state before the advent of article XIII B.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> <em>(Lucia Mar, supra, </em>44 Cal.3d at p. 836.)</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">A contrary conclusion would defeat the purpose of section 6. Under the state\u2019s interpretation of that section, because section 17000 was enacted before 1975, the Legislature could eliminate the <em>entire </em>Medi-Cal program and shift to the counties under section 17000 complete financial responsibility for medical care that the state has been providing since 1966. However, the taxing and spending limitations imposed by articles XIII A and XIII B would greatly limit the ability of counties to meet their expanded section 17000 obligation. \u201cCounty taxpayers would be forced to accept new taxes or see the county forced to cut existing programs further . . . .\u201d <em>(Kinlaw, supra, </em>54 Cal.3d at p. 351 (dis. opn. of Broussard, J.).) As we have previously explained, the voters, recognizing that articles XIII A and XIII B left counties \u201cill equipped\u201d to assume such increased financial responsibilities, adopted section 6 precisely to avoid this result. <em>(County of Los Angeles, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number><em>supra, </em>43 Cal.3d at p. 61.) Thus, it was the voters who decreed that we must, as the state puts it, \u201cfocus[] on one phase in th[e] shifting pattern of [financial] arrangements\u201d between the state and the counties. Under section 6, the state simply cannot \u201ccompel[] [counties] to accept financial responsibility in whole or in part for a program which was funded entirely by the state before the advent of article XIII B . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> <em>(Lucia Mar, supra, </em>44 Cal.3d at p. 836.)</p>\n<p id=\"Ad\">B. <em>County Discretion to Set Eligibility and Service Standards</em></p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">The state next argues that, because San Diego had statutory discretion to set eligibility and service standards, there was no reimbursable mandate. Citing section 16704, the state asserts that the 1982 legislation required San Diego to spend MISA funds \u201conly on those whom the county deems eligible under \u00a7 17000,\u201d \u201cgave the county exclusive authority to determine the level and type of benefits it would provide,\u201d and required counties \u201cto include [adult MIP\u2019s] in their \u00a7 17000 eligibility only to the extent state funds were available and then only for 3 years.\u201d (Original emphasis.)<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> According to the state, under section 17001, \u201c[t]he counties <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>have complete discretion over the determination of eligibility, scope of benefits and how the services will be provided.\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\">The state exaggerates the extent of a county\u2019s discretion under section 17001. It is true \u201ccase law . . . has recognized that section 17001 confers broad discretion upon the counties in performing their statutory duty to provide general assistance benefits to needy residents. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Robbins </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1985) 38 Cal.3d 199, 211 [211 Cal.Rptr. 398, 695 P.2d 695] <em>(Robbins).) </em>However, there are \u201cclear-cut limits\u201d to this discretion. <em>(Ibid.) </em> The counties may exercise their discretion \u201conly within fixed boundaries. In administering General Assistance relief the county acts as an agent of the state. [Citation.] When a statute confers upon a state agency the authority to adopt regulations to implement, interpret, make specific or otherwise carry out its provisions, the agency\u2019s regulations must be consistent, not in conflict with the statute, and reasonably necessary to effectuate its purpose. (Gov. Code, \u00a7 11374.)\u201d <em>(Mooney, supra, </em>4 Cal.3d at p. 679.) Thus, the counties\u2019 eligibility and service standards must \u201ccarry out\u201d the objectives of section 17000. <em>(Mooney, supra, 4 </em>Cal.3d at p. 679; see also <em>Poverty Resistance Center </em>v. <em>Hart </em>(1989) 213 Cal.App.3d 295, 304-305 [261 Cal.Rptr. 545]; \u00a7 11000 [\u201cprovisions of law relating to a public assistance program shall be fairly and equitably construed to effect the stated objects and purposes of the program\u201d].) County standards that fail to carry out section 17000\u2019s objectives \u201care void and no protestations that they are merely an exercise of administrative discretion can sanctify them.\u201d <em>(Morris, supra, </em>67 Cal.2d at p. 737.) Courts, which have \u201c \u2018final responsibility for the interpretation of the law,\u2019 \u201d must strike them down. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 748.) Indeed, despite the counties\u2019 statutory discretion, \u201ccourts have consistently invalidated . . . county welfare regulations that fail to meet statutory requirements. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Robbins, supra, </em>38 Cal.3d at p. 212.)</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">1. <em>Eligibility</em></p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">Regarding eligibility, we conclude that counties must provide medical care to all adult MIP\u2019s. As we emphasized in <em>Mooney, </em>section 17000 requires counties to relieve and support \u201c <em>\u2018all indigent persons </em>lawfully resident therein, \u201cwhen such persons are not supported and relieved by their relatives\u201d or by some other means.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Mooney, supra, 4 </em>Cal.3d at p. 678; see also <em>Bernhardt </em>v. <em>Board of Supervisors </em>(1976) 58 Cal.App.3d 806, 811 [130 Cal.Rptr. 189].) Moreover, section 10000 declares that the statutory \u201cpurpose\u201d of division 9 of the Welfare and Institutions Code, which includes section 17000, \u201cis to provide for protection, care, and assistance to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>people of the state in need thereof, and to promote the welfare and happiness of all of the people of the state by providing appropriate aid and services to <em>all </em>of its needy and distressed.\u201d (Italics added.) Thus, counties have no discretion to refuse to provide medical care to \u201cindigent persons\u201d within the meaning of section 17000 who do not receive it from other sources.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> (See <em>Bell </em>v. <em>Board of Supervisors </em>(1994) 23 Cal.App.4th 1695, 1706 [28 Cal.Rptr.2d 919] [eligibility standards may not \u201cdefeat the purpose of the statutory scheme by depriving qualified recipients of mandated support\u201d]; <em>Washington </em>v. <em>Board of Supervisors </em>(1993) 18 Cal.App.4th 981, 985 [22 Cal.Rptr.2d 852] [courts have repeatedly \u201cvoided county ordinances which have attempted to redefine eligibility standards set by state statute\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b137-4\">Although section 17000 does not define the term \u201cindigent persons,\u201d the 1982 legislation made clear that all adult MIP\u2019s fall within this category for purposes of defining a county\u2019s obligation to provide medical care.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> As part of its exclusion of adult MIP\u2019s, that legislation required counties to participate in the MISA program. (Stats. 1982, ch. 1594, \u00a7\u00a7 68, 70, 86, pp. 6343-6347, 6357.) Regarding that program, the 1982 legislation amended section 16704, subdivision (c)(1), to require that a county board of supervisors, in applying for MISA funds, \u201cassure that it will expend such funds only for [specified] health services . . . provided to persons certified as eligible for such services pursuant to Section 17000 . . . .\u201d (Stats. 1982, ch. 1594, \u00a7 70, p. 6346.) At the same time, the 1982 legislation amended section 16704, subdivision (c)(3), to provide that \u201c[a]ny person whose income and resources meet the income and resource criteria for certification for services pursuant to Section 14005.7 other than for the aged, blind, or disabled, shall not be excluded from eligibility for services to the extent that state funds are provided.\u201d (Stats. 1982, ch. 1594, \u00a7 70, p. 6346.) As the state correctly explains, under this provision, \u201ccounties had to include [Medically Indigent Adults] in their [section] 17000 eligibility\u201d standards. By requiring counties to make all adult MIP\u2019s eligible for services paid for with MISA funds, while at the same time requiring counties to promise to spend such funds <em>only </em>on those certified as eligible under section 17000, the Legislature established that all adult MIP\u2019s are \u201cindigent persons\u201d for purposes of the counties\u2019 duty to provide medical care under section 17000. Otherwise, the counties could not comply with their promise.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>Our conclusion is not affected by language in section 16704, subdivision (c)(3), making it \u201coperative only until June 30, 1985, unless a later enacted statute extends or deletes that date.\u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> As we have explained, the subdivision established that adult MIP\u2019s are \u201cindigent persons\u201d within the meaning of section 17000 for medical care purposes. As we have also explained, section 17000 requires counties to relieve and support <em>all </em>\u201cindigent persons.\u201d Thus, even if the state is correct in asserting that section 16704, subdivision (c)(3), is now inoperative and no longer prohibits counties from excluding adult MIP\u2019s from eligibility for medical services, section 17000 has that effect.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b138-4\">Additionally, the coverage history of Medi-Cal demonstrates that the Legislature has always viewed all adult MIP\u2019s as \u201cindigent persons\u201d within the meaning of section 17000 for medical care purposes. As we have previously explained, when the Legislature created the original Medi-Cal program, which covered only categorically linked persons, it \u201cdeclar[ed] its concern with the problems which [would] be facing the counties with respect to the medical care of indigent persons who [were] not covered\u201d by MediCal, \u201cwhose medical care [had to] be financed entirely by the counties in a time of heavily increasing medical costs.\u201d (Stats. 1966, Second Ex. Sess. 1965, ch. 4, \u00a7 2, p. 116 [enacting former \u00a7 14108.5].) Moreover, to ensure that the counties\u2019 Medi-Cal cost share would not leave counties \u201cwith insufficient funds to provide hospital care for those persons not eligible for Medi-Cal,\u201d the Legislature also created the county option. <em>(Hall, supra, 23 </em>Cal.App.3d at p. 1061.) Through the county option, \u201cthe state agreed to assume all county health care costs ... in excess of county costs incurred during the 1964-1965 fiscal year, adjusted for population increases.\u201d <em>(Lackner, supra, </em>97 Cal.App.3d at p. 586.) Thus, the Legislature expressly recognized that the categorically linked persons initially eligible for Medi-Cal did not constitute all \u201cindigent persons\u201d entitled to medical care under section 17000, and required the state to share in the financial responsibility for providing that care.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">In adding adult MIP\u2019s to Medi-Cal in 1971, the Legislature extended Medi-Cal coverage to noncategorically linked persons \u201cwho [were] financially unable to pay for their medical care.\u201d (Legis. Counsel\u2019s Dig., Assem. Bill No. 949, 3 Stats. 1971 (Reg. Sess.) Summary Dig., p. 83.) This <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>description was consistent with prior judicial decisions that, for purposes of a county\u2019s duty to provide \u201cindigent persons\u201d with hospitalization, had defined the term to include a person \u201cwho has insufficient means to pay for his maintenance in a private hospital after providing for those who legally claim his support.\u201d <em>(Goodall </em>v. <em>Brite </em>(1936) 11 Cal.App.2d 540, 550 [54 P.2d 510].)</p>\n<p id=\"b139-4\">Moreover, the fate of amendments to section 17000 proposed at the same time suggests that, in the Legislature\u2019s view, the category of \u201cindigent persons\u201d entitled to medical care under section 17000 extended even <em>beyond </em>those eligible for Medi-Cal as MIP\u2019s. The June 17, 1971, version of Assembly Bill No. 949 amended section 17000 by adding the following: \u201chowever, the health needs of such persons shall be met under [Medi-Cal].\u201d (Assem. Bill No. 949 (1971 Reg. Sess.) \u00a7 53.3, as amended June 17, 1971.) The Assembly deleted this amendment on July 20, 1971. (Assem. Bill No. 949 (1971 Reg. Sess.) as amended July 20, 1971, p. 37.) Regarding this change, the Assembly Committee on Health explained: \u201cThe proposed amendment to Section 17000, . . . which would have removed the counties\u2019 responsibilities as health care provider of last resort, is deleted. This change was originally proposed to clarify the guarantee to hold counties harmless from additional Medi-Cal costs. It is deleted since it cannot remove the fact that counties are, by definition, a \u2018last resort\u2019 for any person, with or without the means to pay, who does not qualify for federal or state aid.\u201d (Assem. Com. on Health, Analysis of Assem. Bill No. 949 (1971 Reg. Sess.) as amended July 20, 1971 (July 21, 1971), p. 4.)</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">The Legislature\u2019s failure to amend section 17000 in 1971 figured prominently in the Attorney General\u2019s interpretation of that section only two years later. In a 1973 published opinion, the Attorney General stated that the 1971 inclusion of MIP\u2019s in Medi-Cal \u201cdid not alter the duty of the counties to provide medical care to those indigents not eligible for Medi-Cal.\u201d (56 Ops.Cal.Atty.Gen., <em>supra, </em>at p. 569.) He based this conclusion on the 1971 legislation, relevant legislative history, and \u201cthe history of state medical care programs.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 570.) The opinion concluded: \u201cThe definition of medically indigent in [the chapter establishing Medi-Cal] is applicable only to that chapter and <em>does not include all those enumerated in section 17000. </em>If the former medical care program, by providing care only for a specific group, public assistance recipients, did not affect the responsibility of the counties to provide such service under section 17000, we believe the most recent expansion of the medical assistance program does not affect, <em>absent an express legislative intent to the contrary, </em>the duty of the counties under section 17000 to continue to provide services to those eligible under section 17000 but not under [Medi-Cal].\u201d <em>(Ibid., </em>italics added.) The Attorney General\u2019s opinion, although not binding, is entitled to considerable weight. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number><em>(Freedom Newspapers, Inc. </em>v. <em>Orange County Employees Retirement System </em>(1993) 6 Cal.4th 821, 829 [25 Cal.Rptr.2d 148, 863 P.2d 218].) Absent controlling authority, it is persuasive because we presume that the Legislature was cognizant of the Attorney General\u2019s construction of section 17000 and would have taken corrective action if it disagreed with that construction. <em>(California Assn. of Psychology Providers </em>v. <em>Rank </em>(1990) 51 Cal.3d 1, 17 [270 Cal.Rptr. 796, 793 P.2d 2].)</p>\n<p id=\"b140-4\">In this case, of course, we need not (and do not) decide whether San Diego\u2019s obligation under section 17000 to provide medical care extended beyond adult MIP\u2019s. Our discussion establishes, however, that the obligation extended <em>at least </em>that far. The Legislature has made it clear that all adult MIP\u2019s are \u201cindigent persons\u201d under section 17000 for purposes of San Diego\u2019s obligation to provide medical care. Therefore, the state errs in arguing that San Diego had discretion to refuse to provide medical care to this population.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">2. <em>Service Standards</em></p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">A number of statutes are relevant to the state\u2019s argument that San Diego had discretion in setting service standards. Section 17000 requires in general terms that counties \u201crelieve and support\u201d indigent persons. Section 10000, which sets forth the purpose of the division containing section 17000, declares the \u201clegislative intent that aid shall be administered and services provided promptly and humanely, with due regard for the preservation of family life,\u201d so \u201cas to encourage self-respect, self-reliance, and the desire to be a good citizen, useful to society.\u201d (\u00a7 10000.) \u201cSection 17000, as authoritatively interpreted, mandates that medical care be provided to indigents and section 10000 requires that such care be provided promptly and humanely. The duty is mandated by statute. There is no discretion concerning whether to provide such care . . . .\u201d <em>(Tailfeather </em>v. <em>Board of Supervisors </em>(1996) 48 Cal.App.4th 1223, 1245 [56 Cal.Rptr.2d 255] <em>(Tailfeather).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b140-7\">Courts construing section 17000 have held that it \u201cimposes a mandatory duty upon all counties to provide \u2018medically necessary care,\u2019 not just <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>emergency care. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(County of Alameda </em>v. <em>State Bd. of Control </em>(1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 1096, 1108 [18 Cal.Rptr.2d 487]; see also <em>Gardner </em>v. <em>County of Los Angeles </em>(1995) 34 Cal.App.4th 200, 216 [40 Cal.Rptr.2d 271]; \u00a7 16704.1 [prohibiting a county from requiring payment of a fee or charge \u201cbefore [it] renders medically necessary services to . . . persons entitled to services under Section 17000\u201d].) It further \u201cha[s] been interpreted ... to impose a minimum standard of care below which the provision of medical services may not fall.\u201d <em>(Tailfeather, supra, </em>48 Cal.App.4th at p. 1239.) In <em>Tailfeather, </em>the court stated that \u201csection 17000 requires provision of medical services to the poor at a level which does not lead to unnecessary suffering or endanger life and health . . . .\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1240.) In reaching this conclusion, it cited <em>Cooke, supra, </em>213 Cal.App.3d at page 404, which held that section 17000 requires counties to provide \u201cdental care sufficient to remedy substantial pain and infection.\u201d (See also \u00a7 14059.5 [defining \u201c[a] service [as] \u2018medically necessary\u2019 . . . when it is reasonable and necessary to protect life, to prevent significant illness or significant disability, or to alleviate severe pain\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b141-4\">During the years for which San Diego sought reimbursement, Health and Safety Code section 1442.5, former subdivision (c) (former subdivision (c)), also spoke to the level of services that counties had to provide under Welfare and Institutions Code section 17000.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> As enacted in September 1974, former subdivision (c) provided that, whether a county\u2019s duty to provide care to all indigent people \u201cis fulfilled directly by the county or through alternative means, the availability of services, and the quality of the treatment received by people who cannot afford to pay for their health care shall be the same as that available to nonindigent people receiving health care services in private facilities in that county.\u201d (Stats. 1974, ch. 810, \u00a7 3, p. 1765.) The express \u201cpurpose and intent\u201d of the act that contained former subdivision (c) was \u201cto insure that the duty of counties to provide health care to indigents [was] properly and continuously fulfilled.\u201d (Stats. 1974, ch. 810, \u00a7 1, p. 1764.) Thus, until its repeal in September 1992,<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> former subdivision (c) \u201c[r]equire[d] that the availability and quality of services provided to indigents directly by the county or alternatively be the same as that available to nonindigents in private facilities in that county.\u201d (Legis. Counsel\u2019s Dig., Sen. Bill No. 2369, 2 Stats. 1974 (Reg. Sess.) Summary Dig., p. 130; see also <em>Gardner </em>v. <em>County of Los Angeles, supra, </em>34 Cal.App.4th at p. 216; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number><em>Board of Supervisors </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>207 Cal.App.3d at p. 564 [former subdivision (c) required that care provided \u201cbe <em>comparable </em>to that enjoyed by the nonindigent\u201d].)<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> \u201cFor the 1990-91 fiscal year,\u201d the Legislature qualified this obligation by providing: \u201cnothing in [former] subdivision (c) . . . shall require any county to exceed the standard of care provided by the state Medi-Cal program. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, counties shall not be required to increase eligibility or expand the scope of services in the 1990-91 fiscal year for their programs.\u201d (Stats. 1990, ch. 457, \u00a7 23, p. 2013.)</p>\n<p id=\"b142-4\">Although we have identified statutes relevant to service standards, we need not here define the precise contours of San Diego\u2019s statutory health care obligation. The state argues generally that San Diego had discretion regarding the services it provided. However, the state fails to identify either the specific services that San Diego provided under its CMS program or which of those services, if any, were not required under the governing statutes. Nor does the state argue that San Diego could have eliminated all services and complied with statutory requirements. Accordingly, we reject the state\u2019s argument that, because San Diego had some discretion in providing services, the 1982 legislation did not impose a reimbursable mandate.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">VI. Minimum Required Expenditure</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">The Court of Appeal held that, under the governing statutes, the Commission must initially determine the precise amount of any reimbursement due San Diego. It therefore reversed the damages portion of the trial court\u2019s judgment and remanded the matter to the Commission for this determination. Nevertheless, the Court of Appeal affirmed the trial court\u2019s finding that the Legislature required San Diego to spend at least $41 million on its CMS program for fiscal years 1989-1990 and 1990-1991. In affirming this finding, the Court of Appeal relied primarily on section 16990, subdivision (a), as it read at all relevant times. The state contends this provision did not mandate that San Diego spend any minimum amount on the CMS program. It further asserts that the Court of Appeal\u2019s \u201cruling in effect sets a damages baseline, in contradiction to [its] ostensible reversal of the damage award.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b143-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>Former section 16990, subdivision (a), set forth the financial maintenance-of-effort requirement for counties that received funding under the California Healthcare for the Indigent Program (CHIP). The Legislature enacted CHIP in 1989 to implement Proposition 99, the Tobacco Tax and Health Protection Act of 1988 (codified at Rev. &amp; Tax. Code, \u00a7 30121 et seq.). Proposition 99, which the voters approved on November 8, 1988, increased the tax on tobacco products and allocated the resulting revenue in part to medical and hospital care for certain persons who could not afford those services. <em>(Kennedy Wholesale, Inc. </em>v. <em>State Bd. of Equalization </em>(1991) 53 Cal.3d 245, 248, 254 [279 Cal.Rptr. 325, 806 P.2d 1360].) During the 1989-1990 and 1990-1991 fiscal years, former section 16990, subdivision (a), required counties receiving CHIP funds, \u201cat a minimum,\u201d to \u201cmaintain a level of financial support of county funds for health services at least equal to its county match and any overmatch of county funds in the 1988-89 fiscal year,\u201d adjusted annually as provided. (Stats. 1989, ch. 1331, \u00a7 9, p. 5427.) Applying this provision, the Court of Appeal affirmed the trial court\u2019s finding that the state had required San Diego to spend in fiscal years 1989-1990 and 1990-1991 at least $41 million on the CMS program.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-4\">We agree with the state that this finding is erroneous. Unlike participation in MISA, which was mandatory, participation in CHIP was voluntary. In establishing CHIP, the Legislature appropriated funds \u201cfor allocation to counties <em>participating </em>in\u201d the program. (Stats. 1989, ch. 1331, \u00a7 10, p. 5436, italics added.) Section 16980, subdivision (a), directed the State Department of Health Services to make CHIP payments \u201cupon application of the county assuring that it will comply with\u201d applicable provisions. Among the governing provisions were former sections 16990, subdivision (a), and 16995, subdivision (a), which provided: \u201cTo be eligible for receipt of funds under this chapter, a county may not impose more stringent eligibility standards for the receipt of benefits under Section 17000 or reduce the scope of benefits compared to those which were in effect on November 8, 1988.\u201d (Stats. 1989, ch. 1331, \u00a7 9, p. 5431.)</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">However, San Diego has cited no provision, and we have found none, that <em>required </em>eligible counties to participate in the program or apply for CHIP funds. Through Revenue and Taxation Code section 30125, which was part of Proposition 99, the electorate directed that funds raised through Proposition 99 \u201cshall be used to supplement existing levels of service and not to fund existing levels of service.\u201d (See also Stats. 1989, ch. 1331, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 19, pp. 5382, 5438.) Counties not wanting to supplement their existing levels of service, and which therefore did not want CHIP funds, were not bound by the program\u2019s requirements. Those counties, including San Diego, that chose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>to seek CHIP funds did so voluntarily.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> Thus, the Court of Appeal erred in concluding that former section 16990, subdivision (a), mandated a minimum funding requirement for San Diego\u2019s CMS program.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-4\">Nor did former section 16991, subdivision (a)(5), which the trial court and Court of Appeal also cited, establish a minimum financial obligation for San Diego\u2019s CMS program. Former section 16991 generally \u201cestablish[ed] a procedure for the allocation of funds to each county receiving funds from the [MISA] ... for the provision of services to persons meeting certain MediCal eligibility requirements, based on the percentage of newly legalized individuals under the federal Immigration Reform and Control Act (IRCA).\u201d (Legis. Counsel\u2019s Dig., Assem. Bill No. 75, 4 Stats. 1989 (Reg. Sess.) Summary Dig., p. 548.) Former section 16991, subdivision (a)(5), required the state, for fiscal years 1989-1990 and 1990-1991, to reimburse a county if its combined allocation from various sources was less than the funding it received under section 16703 for fiscal year 1988-1989.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> Nothing about this state reimbursement requirement imposed on San Diego a minimum funding requirement for its CMS program.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">Thus, we must reverse the judgment insofar as it finds that former sections 16990, subdivision (a), and 16991, subdivision (a)(5), established a $41 million spending floor for San Diego\u2019s CMS program. Instead, the various statutes that we have previously discussed (e.g., \u00a7\u00a7 10000, 17000, and Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 1442.5, former subd. (c)), the cases construing those statutes, and any other relevant authorities must guide the Commission\u2019s determination of the level of services that San Diego had to provide and any reimbursement to which it is entitled.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>VII. Remaining Issues</p>\n<p id=\"b145-4\">The state raises a number of additional issues. It first complains that a mandamus proceeding under Code of Civil Procedure section 1085 was an improper vehicle for challenging the Commission\u2019s position. It asserts that, under Government Code section 17559, review by administrative mandamus under Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5 is the exclusive method for challenging a Commission decision denying a mandate claim. The Court of Appeal rejected this argument, reasoning that the trial court had jurisdiction under Code of Civil Procedure section 1085 because, under section 6, the state has a ministerial duty of reimbursement when it imposes a mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">Like the Court of Appeal, but for different reasons, we reject the state\u2019s argument. \u201c[M]andamus pursuant to [Code of Civil Procedure] section 1094.5, commonly denominated \u2018administrative\u2019 mandamus, is mandamus still. It is not possessed of \u2018a separate and distinctive legal personality. It is not a remedy removed from the general law of mandamus or exempted from the latter\u2019s established principles, requirements and limitations.\u2019 [Citations.] The full panoply of rules applicable to \u2018ordinary\u2019 mandamus applies to \u2018administrative\u2019 mandamus proceedings, except where modified by statute. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Woods </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1981) 28 Cal.3d 668, 673-674 [170 Cal.Rptr. 484, 620 P.2d 1032].) Where the entitlement to mandamus relief is adequately alleged, a trial court may treat a proceeding brought under Code of Civil Procedure section 1085 as one brought under Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5 and should deny a demurrer asserting that the wrong mandamus statute has been invoked. <em>(Woods, supra, </em>28 Cal.3d at pp. 673-674; <em>Anton </em>v. <em>San Antonio Community Hosp. </em>(1977) 19 Cal.3d 802, 813-814 [140 Cal.Rptr. 442, 567 P.2d 1162].) Thus, even if San Diego identified the wrong mandamus statute, the error did not affect the trial court\u2019s ability to grant mandamus relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">\u201cIn any event, distinctions between traditional and administrative mandate have little impact on this appeal . . . .\u201d <em>(McIntosh </em>v. <em>Aubry </em>(1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 1576, 1584 [18 Cal.Rptr.2d 680].) The determination whether the statutes here at issue established a mandate under section 6 is a question of law. <em>(County of Fresno </em>v. <em>Lehman, supra, </em>229 Cal.App.3d at p. 347.) In reaching our conclusion, we have relied on no facts that are in dispute.

Section 6 of this article provides that when the state \u201cmandates a new program or higher level of service on any local government,\u201d the state must reimburse the local government for the cost of such program or service. Under subdivision (c) of this constitutional provision, however, the state \u201cmay, but need not,\u201d provide such reimbursement <em>if the state mandate was enacted before January 1, 1975. </em>(Cal. Const., art. XIII B, \u00a7 6, subd. (c).) Subdivision (c) is the critical provision here.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-7\">Because the counties have for many decades been under a state mandate to provide for the poor, a mandate that existed before the voters added article XIII B to the state Constitution, the express language of subdivision (c) of section 6 of article XIII B exempts the state from any <em>legal obligation </em>to reimburse the counties for the cost of medical care to the needy. The fact that for a certain period after 1975 the state directly paid under the state Medi-Cal program for these costs did not lead to the creation of a new mandate once the state stopped doing so. To hold to the contrary, as the majority does, is to render subdivision (c) a nullity.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-8\">The issue here is not whether the poor are entitled to medical care. They are. The issue is whether the state or the counties must pay for this care. The majority places this obligation on the state. The counties\u2019 win, however, may be a pyrrhic victory. For, in anticipation of today\u2019s decision, the Legislature has enacted legislation that will drastically reduce the counties\u2019 share of other state revenue, as discussed in part III below.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-9\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b147-10\">Beginning in 1855, California imposed a legal obligation on the counties to take care of their poor. <em>(Mooney </em>v. <em>Pickett </em>(1971) 4 Cal.3d 669, 677-678 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>[94 Cal.Rptr. 279, 483 P.2d 1231].) Since 1965, this obligation has been codified in Welfare and Institutions Code section 17000. (Stats. 1965, ch. 1784, \u00a7 5, p. 4090.) That statute states in full: \u201cEvery county and every city and county shall relieve and support all incompetent, poor, indigent persons, and those incapacitated by age, disease, or accident, lawfully resident therein, when such persons are not supported and relieved by their relatives or friends, by their own means, or by state hospitals or other state or private institutions.\u201d (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 17000.) Included in this is a duty to provide medical care to indigents. <em>(Board of Supervisors </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1989) 207 Cal.App.3d 552, 557 [254 Cal.Rptr. 905].)</p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\">A brief overview of the efforts by federal, state, and local governments to furnish medical services to the poor may be helpful.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">Before March 1, 1966, the date on which California began its Medi-Cal program, medical services for the poor \u201cwere provided in different ways and were funded by the state, county, and federal governments in varying amounts.\u201d (Assem. Com. on Public Health, Preliminary Rep. on Medi-Cal (Feb. 29, 1968) p. 3.) The Medi-Cal program, which California adopted to implement the federal Medicaid program (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396 et seq.; see <em>Morris </em>v. <em>Williams </em>(1967) 67 Cal.2d 733, 738 [63 Cal.Rptr. 689, 433 P.2d 697]), at first limited eligibility to those persons \u201clinked\u201d to a federal categorical aid program by being over age 65, blind, disabled, or a member of a family with dependent children. (Legis. Analyst, Rep. to Joint Legis. Budget Com., Analysis of 1971-1972 Budget Bill, Sen. Bill No. 207 (1971 Reg. Sess.), pp. 548, 550.) Persons not linked to federal programs were ineligible for Medi-Cal; they could obtain medical care from the counties. <em>(County of Santa Clara </em>v. <em>Hall </em>(1972) 23 Cal.App.3d 1059, 1061 [100 Cal.Rptr. 629].)</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">In 1971, the Legislature revised Medi-Cal by extending coverage to certain so-called \u201cnoncategorically linked\u201d persons, or \u201cmedically indigent persons.\u201d (Stats. 1971, ch. 577, \u00a7\u00a7 12, 13, 22.5, 23, pp. 1110-1111, 1115.) The revisions included a formula for determining each county\u2019s share of Medi-Cal costs for the 1972-1973 fiscal year, with increases in later years based on the assessed value of property. <em>(Id. </em>at \u00a7\u00a7 41, 42, pp. 1131-1133.)</p>\n<p id=\"b148-7\">In 1978, California voters added to the state Constitution article XIII A (Proposition 13), which severely limited property taxes. In that same year, to help the counties deal with the drastic drop in local tax revenue, the Legislature assumed the counties\u2019 share of Medi-Cal costs. (Stats. 1978, ch. 292, \u00a7 33, p. 610.) In 1979, the Legislature relieved the counties of their obligation to share in Medi-Cal costs. (Stats. 1979, ch. 282, \u00a7 106, p. 1059.) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>Also in 1979, the voters added to the state Constitution article XIII B, which placed spending limits on state and local governments and added the mandate/reimbursement provisions at issue here.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-4\">In 1982, the Legislature removed from Medi-Cal eligibility the category of \u201cmedically indigent persons\u201d that had been added in 1971. The Legislature also transferred funds for indigent health care services from the state to the counties through the Medically Indigent Services Account. (Stats. 1982, ch. 328, \u00a7\u00a7 6, 8.3, 8.5, pp. 1574-1576; Stats. 1982, ch. 1594, \u00a7\u00a7 19, 86, pp. 6315, 6357.) Medically Indigent Services Account funds were then combined with county health service funds to provide health care to persons not eligible for Medi-Cal (Stats. 1982, ch. 1594, \u00a7 86, p. 6357), and counties were to provide health services to persons in this category \u201cto the extent that state funds are provided\u201d <em>(id., </em>\u00a7 70, p. 6346).</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">From 1983 through June 1989, the state fully funded San Diego County\u2019s program for furnishing medical care to the poor. Thereafter, in fiscal years 1989-1990 and 1990-1991, the state partially funded San Diego County\u2019s program. In early 1991, however, the state refused to provide San Diego County full funding for the 1990-1991 fiscal year, prompting a threat by the county to terminate its indigent medical care program. This in turn led the Legal Aid Society of San Diego to file an action against the County of San Diego, asserting that Welfare and Institutions Code section 17000 imposed a legal obligation on the county to provide medical care to the poor. The county cross-complained against the state. The county argued that the state\u2019s 1982 removal of the category of \u201cmedically indigent persons\u201d from MediCal eligibility mandated a \u201cnew program or higher level of service\u201d within the meaning of section 6 of article XIII B of the California Constitution, because it transferred the cost of caring for these persons to the county. Accordingly, the county contended, section 6 required the state to reimburse the county for its cost of providing such care, and prohibited the state from terminating reimbursement as it did in 1991. The county eventually reached a settlement with the Legal Aid Society of San Diego, leading to a dismissal of the latter\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">While the County of San Diego\u2019s case against the state was pending, litigation was proceeding in a similar action against the state by the County of Los Angeles and the County of San Bernardino. In that action, the Superior Court for the County of Los Angeles entered a judgment in favor of Los Angeles and San Bernardino Counties. The state sought review in the Second District Court of Appeal in Los Angeles. In December 1992, the parties to the Los Angeles case entered into a settlement agreement providing for dismissal of the appeal and vacating of the superior court judgment. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>The Court of Appeal thereafter ordered that the superior court judgment be vacated and that the appeal be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-4\">The County of San Diego\u2019s action against the state, however, was not settled. It proceeded on the county\u2019s claim against the state for reimbursement of the county\u2019s expenditures for medical care to the indigent.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The majority holds that the county is entitled to such reimbursement. I disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">Article XIII B, section 6 of the California Constitution provides: \u201cWhenever the Legislature or any state agency mandates a new program or higher level of service on any local government, the state shall provide a subvention of funds to reimburse such local government for the costs of such program or increased level of service, <em>except that the Legislature may, but need not, provide such subvention of funds for the following mandates: </em>[\u00b6] . . . [\u00b6] <em>(c) Legislative mandates enacted prior to January 1,1975, or executive orders or regulations initially implementing legislation enacted prior to January 1, 1975\" </em>(Italics added.)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b150-7\">Of importance here is Welfare and Institutions Code section 17000 (hereafter sometimes section 17000). It imposes a legal obligation on the counties to provide, among other things, medical services to the poor. <em>(Board of Supervisors </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>207 Cal.App.3d at p. 557; <em>County of San Diego </em>v. <em>Viloria </em>(1969) 276 Cal.App.2d 350, 352 [80 Cal.Rptr. 869].) Section 17000 was enacted long before, and has existed continuously since, January 1, 1975, the date set forth in subdivision (c) of section 6 of article XIII B of the California Constitution. Thus, section 17000 falls within subdivision (c)\u2019s language of \u201c[legislative mandates enacted prior to January 1, 1975,\u201d rendering it exempt from the reimbursement provision of section 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-8\">Contrary to the majority\u2019s conclusion, the Legislature\u2019s 1982 legislation removing the category of \u201cmedically indigent persons\u201d from Medi-Cal did not meet California Constitution, article XIII B, section 6\u2019s requirement of imposing on local government \u201ca new program or higher level of service,\u201d and therefore did not entitle the counties to reimbursement from the state under section 6 of article XIII B. The counties\u2019 legal obligation to provide medical care arises from section 17000, not from the subsequently enacted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>1982 legislation. The majority itself concedes that the 1982 legislation merely \u201ctrigger[ed] the counties\u2019 responsibility to provide medical care as providers of last resort under section 17000.\u201d (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 98.) Although certain actions by the state and the federal government during the 1970\u2019s and 1980\u2019s may have alleviated the counties\u2019 financial burden of providing medical care for the indigent, those actions did not supplant or remove the counties\u2019 existing legal obligation under section 17000 to furnish such care. <em>(Cooke </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1989) 213 Cal.App.3d 401, 411 [261 Cal.Rptr. 706]; <em>Madera Community Hospital </em>v. <em>County of Madera </em>(1984) 155 Cal.App.3d 136, 151 [201 Cal.Rptr. 768].)</p>\n<p id=\"b151-4\">The state\u2019s reimbursement obligation under section 6 of article XIII B of the California Constitution arises only if, after January 1, 1975, the date mentioned in subdivision (c) of section 6, the state imposes on the counties \u201ca new program or higher level of service.\u201d That did not occur here. As I pointed out above, the counties\u2019 legal obligation to provide for the poor arises from section 17000, enacted long before the January 1, 1975, cutoff date set forth in subdivision (c) of section 6. That statutory obligation remained in effect when, during a certain period after 1975, the state assumed the financial burden of providing medical care to the poor, in an effort to help the counties deal with a drastic drop in local revenue as a result of the voters\u2019 passage of Proposition 13, which severely limited property taxes. Because the counties\u2019 statutory obligation to provide health care to the poor was created before 1975 and has existed unchanged since that time, the state\u2019s 1982 termination of Medi-Cal eligibility for \u201cmedically indigent persons\u201d did not create a \u201cnew program or higher level of service\u201d within the meaning of section 6 of article XIII B, and therefore did not obligate the state to reimburse the counties for their expenditures in health care for the poor.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">In imposing on the state a legal obligation to reimburse the counties for their cost of furnishing medical services to the poor, the majority\u2019s holding appears to bail out financially strapped counties. Not so.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-7\">Today\u2019s decision will immediately result in a reduction of state funds available to the counties. Here is why. In 1991, the Legislature added section 11001.5 to the Revenue and Taxation Code, providing that 24.33 percent of the moneys collected by the Department of Motor Vehicles as motor vehicle license fees must be deposited in the State Treasury to the credit of the Local Revenue Fund. In anticipation of today\u2019s decision, the Legislature stated in subdivision (d) of this statute: \u201cThis section shall cease to be operative on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>the first day of the month following the month in which the Department of Motor Vehicles is notified by the Department of Finance of a final judicial determination by the California Supreme Court or any California court of appeal [that]: [U . . . [H (2) The state is obligated to reimburse counties for costs of providing medical services to medically indigent adults pursuant to Chapters 328 and 1594 of the Statutes of 1982.\u201d (Rev. &amp; Tax. Code, \u00a7 11001.5, subd. (d); see also <em>id., </em>\u00a7 10753.8, subd. (b).)</p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\">The loss of such revenue, which the Attorney General estimates at \u201chundreds of millions of dollars,\u201d may put the counties in a serious financial bind. Indeed, realization of the scope of this revenue loss appears to explain why the County of Los Angeles, after a superior court victory in its action seeking state reimbursement for the cost of furnishing medical care to \u201cmedically indigent persons,\u201d entered into a settlement with the state under which the superior court judgment was effectively obliterated by a stipulated reversal. (See <em>Neary </em>v. <em>Regents of University of California </em>(1992) 3 Cal.4th 273 [10 Cal.Rptr.2d 859, 834 P.2d 119].) In a letter addressed to the Second District Court of Appeal, sent while the County of Los Angeles was engaged in settlement negotiations with the state, the county\u2019s attorney referred to the legislation mentioned above in these terms: \u201cThis legislation was quite clearly written with this case in mind. Consequently, to pursue this matter, <em>the County of Los Angeles risks losing a funding source it must have to maintain its health services programs at current levels. </em>The additional funding that might flow to the County from a final judgment in its favor in this matter, is several years away <em>and is most likely of a lesser amount than this County\u2019s share of the vehicle license fees.\u201d </em>(Italics added.) Thus, the County of Los Angeles had apparently determined that a legal victory entitling it to reimbursement from the state for the cost of providing medical care to the category of \u201cmedically indigent persons\u201d would not in fact serve its economic interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">I have an additional concern. According to the majority, whenever there is a change in a state program that has the effect of increasing a county\u2019s financial burden under section 17000 there must be reimbursement by the state. This means that so long as section 17000 continues to exist, an increase in state funding to a particular county for the care of the poor, once undertaken, may be irreversible, thus locking the state into perpetual financial assistance to that county for health care to the needy. This would, understandably, be a major disincentive for the Legislature to ever increase the state\u2019s funding of a county\u2019s medical care for the poor.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">The rigidity imposed by today\u2019s holding will have unfortunate consequences should the state\u2019s limited financial resources prove insufficient to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>reimburse the counties under section 6 of article XIII B of the California Constitution for the \u201cnew program or higher level of service\u201d of providing medical care to the poor under section 17000. In that event, the state may be required to modify this \u201cnew program or higher level of service\u201d in order to reconcile the state\u2019s reimbursement obligation with its finite resources and its other financial commitments. Such modifications are likely to take the form of limitations on eligibility for medical care or on the amount or kinds of medical care that the counties must provide to the poor under section 17000. A more flexible system\u2014one that actively encouraged shared state and county responsibility for indigent medical care, using a variety of innovative funding mechanisms\u2014would be less likely to result in a curtailment of medical services to the poor.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-4\">And if the Legislature is unable or unwilling to appropriate funds to comply with the majority\u2019s reimbursement order, the law allows the county to file \u201cin the Superior Court of the County of Sacramento an action in declaratory relief to declare the mandate unenforceable and enjoin its enforcement.\u201d (Gov. Code, \u00a7 17612, subd. (c); see maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 82.) Such a declaration would do nothing to alleviate the plight of the poor.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">The dispute in this case ultimately arises from a collision between the taxing limitations on the counties imposed by article XIII A of the state Constitution and the preexisting, open-ended mandate imposed on them under Welfare and Institutions Code section 17000 to provide medical care for the poor. As I have explained, the Legislature\u2019s assumption thereafter of some of the resulting financial burden to the counties did not repeal section 17000\u2019s mandate, nor did the Legislature\u2019s later termination of its financial support create a new mandate. In holding to the contrary, the majority imposes on the Legislature an obligation that the Legislature does not have under the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-7\">I recognize that my resolution of this issue\u2014that under existing law the state has <em>no legal obligation </em>to reimburse the counties for health expenditures for the poor\u2014would leave the counties in the same difficult position in which they find themselves now: providing funding for indigent medical care while maintaining other essential public services in a time of fiscal austerity. But complex policy questions such as the structuring and funding of indigent medical care are best left to the counties, the Legislature, and ultimately the electorate, rather than to the courts. It is the counties that must figure out how to allocate the limited budgets imposed on them by the electorate\u2019s adoption of articles XIII A and XIII B of the California Constitution among indigent medical care programs and a host of other pressing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>and essential needs. It is the Legislature that must decide whether to furnish financial assistance to the counties so they can meet their section 17000 obligations to provide for the poor, and whether to continue to impose the obligations of section 17000 on the counties. It is the electorate that must decide whether, given the ever-increasing costs of meeting the needs of indigents under section 17000, counties should be afforded some relief from the taxing and spending limits of articles XIIIA and XIII B, both enacted by voters\u2019 initiative. These are hard choices, but for the reasons just given they are better made by the representative branches of government and the electorate than by the courts.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b150-9\"> I agree with the majority that the superior court had jurisdiction to decide this case. (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at pp. 85-90.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b150-10\"> Section 6 of article XIII B pertains to two types of mandates: new programs and higher levels of service. The words \u201csuch subvention\u201d in the first paragraph of this constitutional provision makes the subdivision (c) exemption applicable to both types of mandates.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
