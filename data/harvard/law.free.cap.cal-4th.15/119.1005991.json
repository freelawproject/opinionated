J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ak6\">Defendant Jeffrey Gerard Jones was convicted, following a jury trial, of two counts of first degree murder (Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 187, 189)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and one count of attempted first degree murder (\u00a7\u00a7 664/187). The jury found true the allegations that defendant personally had used a deadly or dangerous weapon (a hammer) in the commission of each offense (\u00a7 12022, subd. (b)) and found, as special circumstances, that defendant had been convicted in this proceeding of multiple murders (\u00a7 190.2, subd. (a)(3)). The jury further found that defendant, who had pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity, was sane when he committed the charged offenses. Following the penalty phase of the trial, the jury set the penalty at death. This appeal from the resulting judgment of death is automatic. (\u00a7 1239, subd. (b).) For the reasons that follow, we affirm the judgment in its entirety.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b170-7\">\n<em>Competency Hearings</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b170-8\">On January 25, 1985, a felony complaint was filed charging defendant with the present offenses. On March 1, 1985, the municipal court suspended the criminal proceedings and transferred the case to the superior court under section 1368 for a determination of defendant\u2019s mental competence to stand trial.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The superior court appointed Dr. Bruce Kaldor and Dr. Captane Thomson to examine defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-9\">The parties waived their right to a jury and, on September 6, 1985, a hearing to determine defendant\u2019s competence to stand trial commenced before Superior Court Judge Benjamin Diaz. Following a five-day hearing, Judge Diaz ruled that defendant was not competent to stand trial and, on October 1, 1985, ordered that he be committed to Atascadero State Hospital. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>After four months at that facility, officials there determined that defendant\u2019s competency had been restored and, on February 3, 1986, the superior court ordered that defendant be returned from the state hospital and that criminal proceedings be resumed.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">On October 13, 1987, defense attorney Jessie Morris filed a declaration pursuant to section 1368 expressing doubt as to defendant\u2019s competency to stand trial. The superior court again suspended proceedings and reappointed Dr. Kaldor to examine defendant. A jury trial on the issue of defendant\u2019s competency commenced on March 1, 1988. As explained more fully below, defendant presented evidence indicating that he suffered from paranoid schizophrenia and was receiving heavy doses of medication to control the symptoms of that disease. Defendant contended that both the disease itself and the side effects of the medication rendered him incompetent to stand trial. The prosecution countered that defendant was malingering by exaggerating his symptoms of mental illness. The jury found that defendant was competent to stand trial, and the case proceeded to trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">\n<em>Guilt Phase</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b171-7\">The trial began on July 18, 1988. The evidence introduced at the guilt phase of the trial showed the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b171-8\">Shortly after noon on January 21, 1985, Harry Dong was found lying on the floor of a restroom at Sutter\u2019s Fort in Sacramento. He was bleeding profusely from severe wounds to his head and face. Larry Button, an emergency medical technician who treated Dong at the scene, described the victim\u2019s face as \u201cpretty well destroyed.\u201d The fly on the victim\u2019s pants was open, and the victim\u2019s penis was outside his shorts.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-9\">Button noticed defendant, who appeared to be a transient, standing outside the restroom and heard defendant tell another man that the victim\u2019s \u201cface was bashed in.\" This comment attracted Button\u2019s attention because the victim\u2019s injury had been reported as a possible gunshot wound, and appeared to the technician to have been caused by a shotgun.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-10\">Dr. Hugh Moore, a physician specializing in otolaryngology (head and neck surgery), treated Dong at the emergency room of the Sacramento Medical Center of the University of California. Dong\u2019s injuries were caused not by a gunshot, but by many blows with a blunt instrument, such as a baseball bat, the curved end of a crowbar, or a hammer. Dong subsequently died as a result of his injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-11\">At approximately 5 p.m. that same day, January 21, 1985, medical student John Rowland entered the men\u2019s restroom in the lobby of the Sacramento <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>Medical Center and began to use one of the urinals. The next thing he knew, he was lying on the floor in a pool of blood, with his head spinning. He tried to call for help but was unable to yell very loudly. He crawled to the door, raised himself up, and grabbed the door handle. As the door opened, he fell backwards into the lobby.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">Rowland was rushed to the emergency room. Dr. Moore, who was in the operating room treating Dong, was summoned to treat Rowland. Dr. Moore was struck by the fact that Dong and Rowland had sustained \u201cvery similar\u201d injuries on the same day, although Dong\u2019s injuries were more severe than Rowland\u2019s. It appeared that Dong had received many more blows. The injuries to both victims could have been caused by a hammer.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">While Rowland was being treated, a nurse noticed defendant standing in the hallway just outside the emergency room. Defendant stayed for five or ten minutes and then left.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-7\">Rowland survived and was operated upon by two teams of surgeons to repair a series of fractures extending from the rear of his head to the right side of his jaw. He was rendered deaf in one ear, and one side of his face is paralyzed and numb, his balance is impaired, and he has continuing dental problems.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-8\">Shortly after 5 p.m. on the following day, January 22, 1985, Ronald English, an intern at the Sacramento Medical Center, was passing near the men\u2019s restroom in the emergency room when he heard a scream and saw people pointing toward the door of the restroom. English approached, and saw defendant leaving the restroom. English put his hand on defendant\u2019s shoulder and asked him whether he was all right. Defendant responded: \u201cThat guy in there is crazy.\u201d As English and defendant were talking, Parmand Sharma, a custodian at the medical center, entered the restroom and yelled for help, saying someone had been injured. Defendant brushed English\u2019s hand off of his shoulder and \u201ctook off running.\u201d English chased defendant and called for help, while Sharma summoned the campus police. With the help of a bystander, English tackled defendant and held him until campus police officer William Davisson arrived.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-9\">As Officer Davisson handcuffed defendant, he noticed a wooden handle protruding from the waistband at the rear of defendant\u2019s pants, and then removed a claw hammer from defendant\u2019s pants. Officer Davisson learned via his walkie-talkie that an assault had occurred, and responded that he had a suspect in custody. Defendant, who apparently had overheard this conversation, stated: \u201cI have been framed.\" When subsequently booked, defendant was able to follow simple instructions without apparent difficulty.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>While defendant was being pursued, emergency room nurse Jeffrey Howell entered the restroom and found Dr. Michael Corbett slumped in front of the urinal, bleeding profusely from the back of his head. Corbett\u2019s breathing was slow and irregular, and he was nonresponsive and near death. Despite efforts to resuscitate him, Corbett died as a result of his injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">Autopsies revealed that Dong and Corbett died as the result of having received multiple blows from a blunt instrument. Their injuries were quite similar, and both victims displayed circular bruises, approximately one inch in diameter. The hammer found in defendant\u2019s possession could have caused Dong\u2019s and Corbett\u2019s injuries. There were no defensive wounds to indicate that either Dong or Corbett attempted to fend off his attacker.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">Dr. Bahram Cherazi, a neurosurgeon who operated on both Corbett and Rowland, testified that the injuries suffered by both victims were quite similar and \u201cappeared to be imparted by a rounded, pointed but not necessarily a sharp object . . . with a great deal of force.\u201d Both Corbett\u2019s and Rowland\u2019s injuries could have been inflicted by using the hammer seized from defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-7\">Evidence of the following uncharged similar offense was admitted for the limited purpose of proving that defendant was the individual who committed the charged offenses. Shortly after noon on January 18, 1985, three days before Dong was killed, Jere Lipps, a professor of geology at the University of California at Davis, heard someone turn the doorknob of the locked door to his office, and then knock on the door. Professor Lipps opened the door, found defendant standing there, and asked defendant what he wanted. Defendant said he was looking for a friend. When defendant mentioned a room number, Professor Lipps gave him directions to that room. As they spoke, defendant looked over Professor Lipps\u2019s shoulder into the office. Professor Lipps returned to his office and closed the door but, because defendant had acted suspiciously during their encounter, Professor Lipps soon returned to the hallway to see where defendant had gone and was startled to find him still standing near the door. After Professor Lipps repeated the directions he had given earlier, defendant started down the hallway, walking stiffly, with his right arm pressed to his side. Defendant entered a restroom and, a minute or two later, came out and hurried down the hall.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-8\">A few minutes after defendant left the restroom, Professor James McClain entered and found the body of Professor Fred Morris lying on the floor near the urinal in a pool of blood. The zipper on the victim\u2019s trousers was down.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-9\">An autopsy revealed that Morris died \u201cfrom multiple blunt injuries to the skull.\u201d Morris had sustained a circular wound, about an inch in diameter, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>below his left ear; the left side of Morris\u2019s jaw had been shattered, and he had a third wound above his left ear. All of the wounds could have been inflicted by using defendant\u2019s hammer.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">Bloodstains found on the clothing worn by defendant at the time of his arrest were analyzed and found to be inconsistent with defendant\u2019s blood type and consistent with the blood types of victims Corbett, Rowland and Dong. One bloodstain revealed a trait present in Corbett\u2019s blood that appears in only six persons in a thousand. Bloodstains also were found on the hammer seized from defendant. One stain was inconsistent with defendant\u2019s blood and could have been a mixture of blood from several persons.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">Defendant presented an alibi defense to the uncharged offense and to one of the charged offenses, through the testimony of his aunt, Hazel Sadler, who stated that he was at home at the time of the commission of the uncharged murder of Morris on January 18, 1985, and the charged murder of Dong on January 21, 1985. Defendant also presented the testimony of Judy Zimmerman that, at the time of the Dong murder, she was eating lunch near the restroom at Sutter\u2019s Fort and did not notice defendant or any other African-American man in the area.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-7\">At the conclusion of the guilt phase, the jury found defendant guilty of two counts of first degree murder and one count of attempted first degree murder, found that he had used a deadly or dangerous weapon in the commission of each offense, and finally found, as a special circumstance, that he had been convicted in this proceeding of multiple murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-8\">\n<em>Sanity Phase</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b174-9\">As noted above, in addition to pleading not guilty, defendant pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity and, accordingly, a sanity phase hearing was conducted after the jury returned its verdicts at the guilt phase.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-10\">At the commencement of the sanity phase hearing, the parties stipulated that the evidence introduced during the guilt phase could be considered by the jury at the sanity phase. In addition, defendant\u2019s mother and two family friends testified to defendant\u2019s increasingly aberrational behavior during the years leading up to the charged offenses, including lack of personal hygiene, paranoid behavior, and complaints of hearing voices. A childhood friend of defendant testified to a marked change in defendant\u2019s behavior during or after defendant\u2019s years in high school. After leaving high school, defendant did not bathe regularly, wore dirty clothes, had difficulty communicating, and acted strangely.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>Several psychiatrists and other mental health professionals testified on behalf of defendant that he suffered from paranoid schizophrenia and was receiving heavy doses of medication to control the symptoms of that disease. Several of these physicians opined that defendant was not legally sane at the time of the offense, but also acknowledged that defendant displayed an antisocial personality disorder and that it was difficult to determine whether a patient was malingering. The prosecution introduced no evidence during the sanity phase of the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">The jury found that defendant was sane when he committed the charged offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">\n<em>Penalty Phase</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b175-7\">A psychiatrist and a clinical psychologist offered further details regarding defendant\u2019s mental illness and antisocial personality disorder. Family members and friends testified that defendant appeared normal during childhood but showed signs of mental illness during and after his years in high school. The prosecution presented no evidence during the penalty phase of the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-8\">The jury returned a verdict of death.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-9\">n</p>\n<p id=\"b175-10\">\n<em>Competency to Stand Trial</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b175-11\">As noted above, two hearings were held under section 1368 to determine defendant\u2019s competency to stand trial. Defendant asserts he was denied due process of law because the trial court failed to initiate a third competency hearing. We describe in some detail the evidence introduced at the second competency hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-12\">Dr. William Greenough, an emergency room physician at Sutter-Davis Hospital in Davis, the city where defendant resided with his mother, testified at the jury trial on the issue of defendant\u2019s competency that on August 3, 1983, a year and a half before the present offenses, defendant entered the emergency room with a \u201cvariety of complaints,\u201d including that his head was \u201csplitting open,\u201d he felt as if he were \u201cturning into two different people,\u201d and he feared he had been poisoned with embalming fluid. Following a physical examination that disclosed no medical problems, and a psychiatric examination, Dr. Greenough diagnosed defendant as having \u201ca severe psychiatric mental disorder, most probably paranoid schizophrenia, which had most probably been present for many years.\u201d He did not believe defendant was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>malingering. Dr. Greenough arranged for defendant to be admitted to the psychiatric unit at Woodland Memorial Hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">Although defendant entered the hospital voluntarily, he later became hostile and asked to be discharged. Dr. Edward Doehne determined that defendant was a danger to himself and others, placed a 72-hour hold on defendant pursuant to Welfare and Institutions Code section 5150,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and administered to him, by injection, the antipsychotic medication Prolixin.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> At one point, defendant attempted to leave the hospital and was placed in restraints for several hours. Defendant later consented to take his medication orally, and his condition seemed to improve.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">Dr. Theodore Hoffman, Jr., a psychiatrist, also treated defendant at Woodland Memorial Hospital and concluded defendant \u201cwas experiencing a paranoid schizophrenic disorder of a grandiose type.\u201d Dr. Hoffman believed defendant truly was psychotic and was not elaborating upon his symptoms.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-7\">At the conclusion of the 72-hour period, Dr. Doehne requested that defendant be held for an additional 14 days,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> but that request was denied and defendant was released on August 8, 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-8\">On May 1, 1984, Dr. Greenough again examined defendant in the emergency room of the Sutter-Davis Hospital. Defendant complained he was \u201cfeeling bad all over\u201d and described many ailments, including \u201ca burning pain \u2018in the middle of [his] brain.\u2019 \u201d A physical examination disclosed no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>medical problems, and Dr. Greenough reaffirmed his conclusion that defendant \u201chad a major psychiatric problem, which was probably paranoid schizophrenia.\u201d He believed defendant\u2019s mental condition had worsened from when he had seen defendant eight months earlier. Defendant again was referred to Woodland Memorial Hospital, where Dr. Hoffman prescribed the psychotropic medication Navane.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">Gillian Rumsey, a psychiatric nurse who is the program manager of the Sacramento County jail psychiatric services, met defendant in January 1985 shortly after his arrest on the current charges, when defendant became a prisoner at the county jail. From January to March of 1985, defendant refused medication, did not communicate verbally, and did not bathe regularly. When Rumsey would enter his cell, which was scattered with garbage, defendant would turn away and stare at the wall. In March 1985, Rumsey had defendant transferred to the psychiatric unit of the jail for 72 hours of observation, because defendant had been pacing in his cell and appeared agitated. Defendant was involuntarily medicated with the neuroleptic Haldol but, when returned to a regular cell, refused further medication.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">On March 19, 1985, Dr. Bruce Kaldor, a psychiatrist appointed by the municipal court to evaluate defendant\u2019s competency to stand trial, examined defendant in his jail cell. Defendant appeared alert but refused to communicate with Dr. Kaldor. The jailers with whom Dr. Kaldor spoke had not observed defendant talking to himself or appearing to hear voices. Dr. Kaldor testified that defendant could be competent to stand trial even though he suffered from paranoid schizophrenia; \u201c[A] paranoid schizophrenic can be quite competent. Competency does not necessarily equate with mental illness. So a person may have the disease of schizophrenia and be personally able to stand trial due to his competency.\u201d Dr. Kaldor added that a person with antisocial personality disorder also may be competent to stand trial, and that a person with an antisocial personality disorder is more likely to malinger or fake a mental illness.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-7\">Nurse Rumsey testified that defendant remained unmedicated until July, when he again became agitated, yelling threats, disrobing and standing nude in his cell, and inducing vomiting and spreading the vomitus on the walls. Defendant again was transferred to the psychiatric unit and involuntarily medicated with Haldol. After 14 days, defendant was returned to the regular jail population and agreed to continue his medication voluntarily. To decrease side effects, his medication was changed to the neuroleptic Thorazine Prolixin.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-8\">On August 22,1985, Dr. Kaldor examined defendant in an interview room at the jail. Dr. Kaldor told defendant he was there to determine whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>defendant was competent to stand trial, but defendant did not respond initially. After Dr. Kaldor several times requested defendant\u2019s cooperation, defendant stated: \u201cI\u2019m hearing voices, hallucinating.\u201d Dr. Kaldor asked defendant about the voices, but defendant would not elaborate. Later, defendant added: \u201cI am seeing things.\u201d When asked what he was seeing, defendant replied: \u201cEyeballs.\u201d About 15 minutes into the interview, defendant turned his back on Dr. Kaldor and refused to say anything more. Dr. Kaldor considered reports from jailers who said that defendant appeared to be rational, read the newspaper, and conversed with other inmates. Dr. Kaldor stated that these reports \u201craised the question in my mind as to whether Mr. Jones was malingering .... And essentially I gave him the doubt. [&lt;fl] I thought the likelihood was greater that he was incompetent than competent . . . .\u201d As noted above, the court concluded that defendant was not competent to stand trial and committed him to Atascadero State Hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">Dr. Harold Carmel was a staff psychiatrist at Atascadero State Hospital when defendant was admitted on October 16, 1985. The initial assessment of defendant was that he was psychotic, possibly suffered hallucinations from an organic cause, and possibly was malingering. On October 23, 1985, after a week of examinations, the staff noted \u201cmany inconsistencies in his story which suggest a conscious deceptiveness.\u201d The initial diagnosis of psychosis was confirmed, but with a \u201cpossibility of some degree of malingering.\u201d Dr. Carmel examined defendant on October 28, 1985 and concluded he \u201cprobably had a chronic psychosis with an element of malingering.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">On October 29, 1985, a psychiatric technician observed defendant tell another patient \u201cthat he wasn\u2019t going to leave the hospital for a long time, just watch. And then he laughed.\u201d On November 4, 1985, a psychiatric technician heard defendant say: \u201cI am incompetent and will be for a long time.\u201d This was unusual because \u201cthe concept of incompetence is actually one of the more difficult things for an incompetent person to grasp. It is an abstract concept.\u201d Defendant\u2019s behavior was a problem. He was involved in a minor tussle with another patient, and defendant\u2019s privilege to be in the halls was withheld. Defendant would pressure lower functioning patients for cigarettes and coffee. On November 11, 1985, defendant said to a female psychiatric technician: \u201cI\u2019ll give you loving, gal; just get over here right now.\u201d When the technician told him his behavior was inappropriate, he responded: \u201cI\u2019m mentally ill. I can\u2019t help what I say.\u201d This showed that defendant understood \u201cthat there is the possibility of being excused from behavior as a result of the mental illness.\u201d On November 18, 1985, a psychiatric technician heard defendant say: \u201cI am incompetent, I don\u2019t remember anything about my crime,\u201d and then laugh. But on January 8, 1986, Dr. Carmel overheard defendant tell another patient: \u201cThey got the weapon and blood stains, but they ain\u2019t got no witnesses.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b179-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>Social worker Lawrence Thomson reported that defendant acted slow and dulled in formal settings, but was more lively and alert with other patients. In all, defendant\u2019s behavior was \u201cconsistent with a man with a chronic psychiatric illness who is exaggerating his symptoms[;] who was malingering in that sense.\u201d On December 4, 1985, defendant asked social worker Thomson for help in completing an application for disability payments under social security. Thomson noted that defendant seemed \u201crational and focused when he wants his needs met.\u201d From December 5-12, 1985, psychological tests were administered to defendant by psychologist intern James Frank under the supervision of staff psychologist Dr. Riley. The resulting diagnosis was \u201cschizophrenia, paranoid type in remission, malingering and antisocial personality disorder.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">Defendant was taking 40 milligrams of Navane per day while at Atascadero State Hospital. He was required to take his medication, but complied willingly and told Dr. Carmel that he needed his medication to stay competent.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">After defendant was returned to jail from Atascadero on February 7, 1986, he was taking 40 milligrams of Navane per day and 4 milligrams of Cogentin to control side effects. Between June and October 1986, defendant requested an increase in his medication, stating he was hearing voices, and his daily dose of Navane was increased to 50 milligrams. Rumsey reported \u201cthere was a marked improvement in his appearance, in his behavior, in the condition of his cell, in his personal hygiene.\u201d Defendant \u201creported a decrease in the volume and frequency of the voices.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b179-7\">In July 1986 and August 1987, Dr. Daniel Edwards, a clinical psychologist, administered intelligence tests that indicated defendant was retarded. Dr. Edwards noted that defendant had scored significantly higher on an intelligence test conducted at Atascadero State Hospital late in 1985. This change in performance could have been caused by a worsening of defendant\u2019s psychosis or could indicate that defendant was malingering. Dr. Edwards noted that a personality test conducted at Atascadero State Hospital was deemed invalid \u201cbecause of the high score on one of the validity checks.\u201d Dr. Edwards explained that defendant had \u201cchecked so many symptoms and the scale was so elevated in terms of pathological condition that either he didn\u2019t understand what he was doing and maybe checked randomly ... or was malingering.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b179-8\">Although defendant had graduated from high school in the 44th percentile of his class, having received a B in algebra, defendant performed at a preschool level on a vocabulary test administered by Dr. Edwards. This <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>apparent dramatic drop in mental ability could have resulted from the onset of organic brain damage, the development of a psychosis, or malingering on defendant\u2019s part. Defendant appeared incapable of making complex decisions, such as whether he should testify in his own behalf. When asked about defendant\u2019s \u201cmental age,\u201d Dr. Edwards estimated that defendant was \u201cperforming at the level of a third grader at best, in my opinion, which would be like a nine or ten-year-old at best.\u201d Dr. Edwards diagnosed defendant as suffering from \u201can atypical organic brain syndrome with possible dementia,\u201d and \u201c[sjchizophrenia, paranoid type chronic.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">On November 4,1986, defendant again complained of hearing voices, and his medication was increased to 60 milligrams per day. On November 7, 1986, defendant appeared more withdrawn. The dosage was increased again on November 18, 1986, to 70 milligrams per day. On May 19, 1987, the dosage was decreased to 50 milligrams per day due to the fear of irreversible side effects. On June 2, 1987, after defendant reported an increase in the volume and frequency of the voices, his dosage of Navane was increased to 60 milligrams per day. On June 12, 1987, it again was increased to 70 milligrams per day. Defendant appeared more spontaneous. Between January 1986, and the time of the second competency hearing (March 18, 1988), defendant improved slightly, began to address Nurse Rumsey by name, and would wave at her if he saw her in the hallway. Rumsey agreed that, since his return from Atascadero, defendant had been successfully maintained on medications, and that his mental condition was better than before he went to Atascadero.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">Psychiatrist Dr. Marlene Mirassou, medical director of the psychiatric unit of the Sacramento County jail, examined defendant on October 1, 1987, to render a second opinion regarding defendant\u2019s medication. Defendant\u2019s daily dosage of Navane was 80 milligrams at that time. The psychiatrists working at the jail had agreed that if more than 60 milligrams per day was prescribed, an additional psychiatrist would review the case. Dr. Mirassou stated that the \u201cusual therapeutic range\u201d for Navane was \u201caround sixty milligrams a day,\u201d but she explained that this was \u201cnot an absolute upper limit.\u201d \u201c[I]n fact, Navane can be used in doses of over one hundred milligrams per day. But that is not usual.\u201d Exceeding a dosage of 60 milligrams per day rarely increases the beneficial response. One reason Dr. Mirassou examined defendant was to see whether his was \u201cone of the rare cases\u201d in which a higher dose was appropriate. The possible side effects of Navane include \u201cmuscle spasms, muscle tics or twitches\u201d and lowered blood pressure. \u201cIn terms of short-term side effects it is fairly safe. Even in large doses. It is extended doses that are of concern.\u201d If a person who did not have a psychotic mental disorder took a daily dose of 60 milligrams of Navane, it is likely that person would be extremely sedated by it.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>Dr. Mirassou advised defendant that at his current dosage he might have more trouble with muscle twitches, but defendant related that when his medication was decreased he had \u201cmore difficulty with the voices.\u201d Defendant indicated \u201che preferred the increased dose and the improved symptoms . . . .\u201d According to defendant, \u201cthe positive effect of the medication was worth risking the possible side effects.\u201d Dr. Mirassou added: \u201cAnd when I saw Mr. Jones again two weeks later [on October 15, 1987] when a question about his ability to give consent had been brought up, we talked about it again, and he gave me the same general idea.\u201d After spending a half hour with defendant, Dr. Mirassou felt that, given more time, defendant was capable of giving informed consent to taking the medication. Other possible side effects of Navane include weight gain, breast enlargement, and drowsiness.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">Eugene Lockmiller testified that from January 1986 to July 1987, he was a guard on the day shift at the Sacramento County jail. Defendant was in a single cell and slept most of the time. He had a subscription to the Sacramento Bee, but Lockmiller never saw defendant read the newspaper. Defendant would grin in response to jokes and was able to understand and follow instructions, but was extremely slow.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">As noted above, on October 13, 1987, defense attorney Morris filed a declaration pursuant to section 1368 expressing doubt as to defendant\u2019s competency to stand trial. The superior court suspended proceedings and again appointed Dr. Kaldor to evaluate defendant\u2019s competency.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-7\">Dr. Kaldor interviewed defendant on November 18, 1987. Defendant responded to Dr. Kaldor\u2019s questions and gave accurate information concerning various topics, such as defendant\u2019s age and where he had lived prior to his incarceration. Dr. Kaldor found a marked improvement in defendant\u2019s condition compared to when he had examined defendant two years earlier. The psychiatrist was concerned that defendant was not as cooperative as he could be. Defendant stated that he heard voices every day, about 20 hours per day. The voices said they were going to kill him. Dr. Kaldor said: \u201cI was impressed on how much he had improved as a result of his treatment at Atascadero.\u201d Defendant knew he was charged with three murders and said it was: \u201cBecause I killed some people.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b181-8\">Dr. Kaldor asked defendant about his defense to the current charges, and defendant indicated his attorney \u201cis going to do an insanity thing. It means that I am crazy, I think. I didn\u2019t know what I was doing. The voices told me to kill them.\u201d Dr. Kaldor asked defendant \u201chow he would explain his way out of these charges,\u201d and defendant responded: \u201cTell them that I was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>hearing voices at the time .... Tell them I was sick.\u201d Dr. Kaldor was concerned whether defendant was malingering and concluded that defendant was schizophrenic but, nevertheless, was competent to stand trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">Psychiatrist Dr. James Peal examined defendant and concluded that he was not competent to stand trial. Upon first examining defendant in 1985, Dr. Peal concluded: \u201cHe was, for the most part, mute. He was unable to respond to questions other than his name and other than the fact that he heard voices.\u201d \u201cMy conclusion was that Mr. Jones had manifestations of. a major mental illness. He was responding to voices. The voices interfered with his ability to think and to hear or respond to what was being asked. He was preoccupied almost entirely with the voices and he was not able to tell me in any fashion what the voices were telling him except that they were telling him to kill. He was extremely frightened of the voices at that time.\u201d Dr. Peal examined him several times after defendant returned from Atascadero, including in August 1987 and on March 2 and 6, 1988, finding that \u201cthe clinical picture didn\u2019t change very much.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">Regarding whether defendant understood the charges, Dr. Peal stated: \u201cJeffrey Jones knows in a very specific concrete way that he is accused of a major crime in the sense that he can say, yes, I am accused of murder. In terms of real understanding what that means, I don\u2019t think he has it.\u201d Defendant told Dr. Peal that he had killed some people. Regarding defendant\u2019s ability to testify: \u201cMy opinion is that his ability to testify is grossly impaired. It is impaired by his illness and it is impaired by the medication that he is on to treat or contain his illness. [&lt;\u00a10 I found that he was unable to understand or comprehend questions. He could not pay attention long enough to hear the questions. He was preoccupied with hearing these voices so that he couldn\u2019t understand the questions, and he responded to most of them usually with no response or with an I don\u2019t know or I don\u2019t remember. [*jQ He has difficulty with the medication that he is on and the amount even in focusing his attention on anything or staying awake.\u201d Dr. Peal believed that defendant could not participate in his defense because he could not furnish information to his attorneys and does not understand \u201cwhat this is all about.\u201d Defendant\u2019s \u201crecent and remote\u201d memory is \u201cgrossly impaired.\u201d \u201cThe problem with his recent memory is that not only is he competing with his voices, but he is competing with the eighty milligrams of Navane that he is on which impairs his ability to perceive, a great deal of the time he is somnambulant. He\u2019s sleeping. So he can\u2019t take in what is going on if he is asleep.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b182-7\">Dr. Peal concluded that defendant suffers from \u201cschizophrenia, paranoid type.\u201d In Dr. Peal\u2019s view, schizophrenics cannot malinger and a person <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>cannot be schizophrenic and have an antisocial personality disorder. Dr. Peal does not believe defendant has an antisocial personality disorder, and does not believe defendant is a malingerer.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">Psychologist Grant Hutchinson testified that defendant is a paranoid schizophrenic, but also \u201chas a personality disorder of the antisocial type.\u201d Dr. Hutchinson stated his belief that schizophrenics can exaggerate their symptoms, opining: \u201cI feel at various times and on different occasions this defendant has malingered.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">At the time of the hearing on March 17, 1988, defendant was taking 90 milligrams of Navane daily. Regarding the circumstance that defendant slept much of the time, Dr. Mirassou stated: \u201cAgain, one of the problems in this particular setting is that the amount of stimulation, the amount of things to do available to the inmates is extremely low, especially in a single cell, and many people off of medication don\u2019t do anything but sleep and eat.\u201d As Dr. Mirassou later put it: \u201cI never know whether it is the jail or the medication.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b183-7\">On March 30, 1988, the jury found defendant competent to stand trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-8\">On July 13, 1988, at the conclusion of a hearing on pretrial motions, defense counsel made the following statement: \u201cAs the Court knows, the defense made a [Penal Code section] 1368 request and we had a ruling against us. Our position hasn\u2019t changed with regard to our belief that we believe Mr. Jones lacks competency. And I simply want to put on the record now that he is sitting there with his eyes closed and appears to be sort of nodding off. And he is on heavy doses of medication that has a side effect of drowsiness. And I would simply like the record to reflect that at the present time for whatever value to the proceedings it is relevant.\u201d The court responded: \u201cAll right. The record will so reflect.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b183-9\">The guilt phase of the trial commenced with jury selection on July 18, 1988. The following day, during voir dire, defense counsel stated: \u201cBefore we have take [szc] a recess, I would like to put on the record that during the course of voir dire of Mr. Ames, Mr. Jones was sleepy, and my belief is he slept approximately about seventy percent of the particular voir dire. I simply would place that on the record for whatever purposes.\u201d The court responded: \u201cI would indicate to you that I caught your eye as well as when I was looking at him, I looked down at him and while he appeared to be asleep, at one point one eye opened and he looked around to see me and then immediately closed it and went back to sleeping. For what ever purpose that is. But yes, the record will so reflect.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b183-10\">On July 20, 1988, defense counsel stated, \u201c[j]ust for the record,\u201d that defendant appeared to be sleeping during the entire voir dire of one juror. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>The court responded: \u201cAll right. The record will reflect he has apparently had his eyes closed most of the time.\u201d Defense counsel made a similar statement on July 26, 1988. On August 2, 1988, defense counsel stated during voir dire: \u201cToday Jeffrey Jones seems to be incredibly more drowsy than any other time I have seen him, and he slept pretty much the entire morning.\u201d The court responded: \u201cThe record will reflect for most of the morning he has had his eyes closed.\u201d On August 9, 1988, defense counsel stated: \u201c[T]his morning during the voir dire, Mr. Jones was, I believe, asleep for about fifteen minutes this morning. I ask the Court to put it on the record because I believe it has to do with the problem of him being overmedicated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">On September 7, 1988, the tables turned somewhat. The prosecutor noted that \u201cthe last few days [defendant] has been at least sitting there with his eyes closed more often than not\u201d and asked whether \u201cit might be appropriate if we can give his jail doctors a call to see if there is a problem with his medications or can they vary them so he is a little more alert during his death penalty trial.\u201d Defense counsel responded: \u201cAbsent the medication, the problems that Jeffrey Jones has is that the voices start getting louder. . . . [Tjhere are certain psychotic symptoms and signs that take place and he becomes a control problem. And while he has been on medication there hasn\u2019t been a control problem at all. . . . [*][] It is just that I am not so sure that if there is a middle ground\u2014they tried changing medications, I am aware of, and the other medication had a side effect that is far worse than the one he is on. [&lt;][] I recognize the jail is doing the best they can, and, I mean, I will encourage any efforts to improve his condition, but my belief is the condition he is in right now is probably the best that we have got.\u201d The trial court encouraged both defense counsel and the prosecutor to contact defendant\u2019s physicians at the jail to ascertain whether defendant\u2019s medications could be adjusted, stating that the court did not know \u201cwhether he is not sleeping at night and sleeping during the day,\u201d and adding: \u201cI noticed his head was nodding this morning.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">On September 22, 1988, at the close of the prosecution\u2019s case in the guilt phase, the trial court remarked: \u201cFor the record, several times this afternoon [defense counsel] has been yawning.\u201d Defense counsel rejoined: \u201cYes, but I didn\u2019t fall asleep like my client who slept part of the morning and this afternoon.\u201d On October 31, 1988, during the sanity phase, the court directed the bailiffs \u201cto get Mr. Jones up and moving around so he can stay awake.\u201d Defense counsel noted that defendant \u201capparently fell asleep,\u201d to which the court responded: \u201cHis eyes were closed. Occasionally they open. How far asleep he was, I don\u2019t know. But I want him to get up and move around.\u201d Finally, on November 1, 1988, at the conclusion of a discussion of jury instructions for the sanity phase, the following colloquy occurred: \u201c[Defense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>Counsel]: I would just ask the record reflect during the time we have been discussing this Jeffrey Jones has been sitting there\u2014 [*][] The Court: Let the record reflect he again had his eyes closed. I cannot make a determination at the time whether he is asleep or just closing his eyes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">An engrossed settled statement on appeal, issued by the trial court on June 26, 1992, stated that, during the guilt and penalty phases of the trial, \u201cthe Court was not watching defendant at all times.[<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>] When defendant\u2019s counsel asked the Court to note for the record that defendant was asleep, this Court noticed that defendant was sitting erect with his eyes closed and so noted for the record. This Court does not recall any other instances in which defendant had his eyes closed during the proceedings. [*][] Based on the testimony of [defense counsel], this Court finds that there were one or more other occasions during the guilt phase of the trial, which were not brought to the Court\u2019s attention and therefore not reflected in the record, where defendant was sitting erect with his eyes closed . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">As noted above, defendant asserts he was denied due process of law because the trial court failed to conduct an additional competency hearing pursuant to section 1368 despite \u201csubstantial new evidence\u201d suggesting that defendant \u201cwas daily being sedated into a veritable stupor\u201d by the administration of antipsychotic drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-7\">\u201cA person cannot be tried or adjudged to punishment while that person is mentally incompetent. A defendant is mentally incompetent for purposes of this chapter if, as a result of mental disorder or developmental disability, the defendant is unable to understand the nature of the criminal proceedings or to assist counsel in the conduct of a defense in a rational manner.\u201d (\u00a7 1367, subd. (a).)  To the same effect, the United States Supreme Court has held that \u201c \u2018the criminal trial of an incompetent defendant violates due process.\u2019 [Citations.] ...[*][] The test for incompetence is also well-settled. A defendant may not be put to trial unless he \u2018 \u201chas sufficient present ability to consult with his lawyer with a reasonable degree of rational understanding . . . [and] a rational as well as factual understanding of the proceedings against him.\u201d \u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Cooper </em>v. <em>Oklahoma </em>(1996) 517 U.S._, _ [116 S.Ct. 1373, 1376-1377, 134 L.Ed.2d 498].)</p>\n<p id=\"b185-10\">\u201cWhen the accused presents substantial evidence of incompetence, due process requires that the trial court conduct a full competency hearing. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>[Citation.] Evidence is \u2018substantial\u2019 if it raises a reasonable doubt about the defendant\u2019s competence to stand trial. [Citation.] The court\u2019s duty to conduct a competency hearing arises when such evidence is presented at any time \u2018prior to judgment.\u2019 [Citations.] [U When a competency hearing has already been held and the defendant has been found competent to stand trial, however, a trial court need not suspend proceedings to conduct a second competency hearing unless it \u2018is presented with a substantial change of circumstances or with new evidence\u2019 casting a serious doubt on the validity of that finding. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Jones </em>(1991) 53 Cal.3d 1115, 1152-1153 [282 Cal.Rptr. 465, 811 P.2d 757]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Kelly </em>(1992) 1 Cal.4th 495, 542 [3 Cal.Rptr.2d 677, 822 P.2d 385].)</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">Two competency hearings were held in the present case. The municipal court initiated the first hearing, which resulted in a suspension of the criminal prosecution and defendant\u2019s transfer to Atascadero State Hospital. After it was determined that defendant had become competent to stand trial, and criminal proceedings had resumed, defense counsel informed the court he believed defendant was incompetent to stand trial. Defendant again was evaluated by mental health professionals, and a jury trial was held, following which the jury found defendant was competent to stand trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">A primary issue at the competency trial was whether defendant was malingering by exaggerating the symptoms of his mental illness.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Evidence also was introduced establishing that defendant was taking large doses of medication, one side effect of which was sleepiness. Defense counsel argued to the jury that the drowsiness caused by the medication was sufficient alone to support a finding that defendant was incompetent to stand trial. The jury found that defendant was competent.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-7\">Following the second competency hearing, defense counsel periodically noted \u201cfor the record\u201d that defendant appeared to be asleep, but did not request a third competency hearing, apparently concluding that defendant\u2019s apparent drowsiness did not constitute substantial new evidence of incompetence. Defense counsel stated on the first occasion the issue was raised following the competency trial: \u201cOur position hasn\u2019t changed with regard to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>our belief that we believe Mr. Jones lacks competency. And I simply want to put on the record now that he is sitting there with his eyes closed and appears to be sort of nodding off. And he is on heavy doses of medication that has a side effect of drowsiness. And I would simply like the record to reflect that at the present time for whatever value to the proceedings it is relevant.\u201d  The circumstance that defendant appeared sleepy or drowsy during court proceedings did not constitute \u201ca substantial change of circumstances\u201d or \u201cnew evidence\u201d of incompetence necessitating a third competency hearing. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Jones, supra, </em>53 Cal.3d 1115, 1153.)</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">Defendant asserts that because the judge who presided over the guilt, sanity, and penalty phases of the trial had not presided over either of the two competency hearings, that judge \u201chad a duty to make an independent assessment\u201d of defendant\u2019s competence. Defendant cites no authority in support of this proposition, and we are aware of none. It is absurd to suggest that, following a jury trial at which it is determined that defendant is competent to stand trial, the assignment of another judge to conduct further proceedings, standing alone, necessitates relitigating the issue of defendant\u2019s competence to stand trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">It also appears that the judge who presided over the guilt, sanity, and penalty phases of the trial was not presented with substantial evidence of incompetence that would have necessitated a further hearing on defendant\u2019s competence to stand trial. The judge made it clear that he could not determine whether defendant was sleeping or simply had closed his eyes, and the judge suspected that defendant may have been malingering by exaggerating the extent of his drowsiness. On one occasion when defense counsel raised this issue, the court remarked that while defendant had appeared to be asleep, \u201cat one point one eye opened and he looked around to see me and then immediately closed it and went back to sleeping.\u201d In the engrossed settled statement, the court stated it could not determine whether defendant was asleep or simply had his eyes closed, but was careful to note that defendant remained sitting erect when his eyes were closed. Based upon the record as a whole, the trial court did not err in failing to conduct a third competency hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-7\">\n<em>Administration of Antipsychotic Drugs</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b187-8\">Relying upon the decision in <em>Riggins </em>v. <em>Nevada </em>(1992) 504 U.S. 127 [112 S.Ct. 1810, 118 L.Ed.2d 479], defendant contends he was denied due process of law because antipsychotic drugs were administered to him to control his schizophrenia during the course of the proceedings conducted in the present case. The defendant in <em>Riggins </em>was charged with murder and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>robbery. While in jail, he told a psychiatrist he was hearing voices in his head, and the psychiatrist prescribed medication, including an antipsychotic drug. Prior to trial, the defense moved the court for an order suspending administration of the medications the defendant was taking. At a hearing on the motion, two psychiatrists testified that, without medication, defendant would remain competent to stand trial and his demeanor would not change noticeably. A third psychiatrist testified the medication made defendant calmer, but he could not predict how defendant would react if taken off the medication. A fourth psychiatrist testified defendant was incompetent to stand trial even while taking the medication, and predicted that, without medication, defendant\u2019s condition would deteriorate. The trial court, without indicating its reasoning, denied the motion to suspend administration of the medication. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 130-131 [112 S.Ct. at pp. 1812-1813].)</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">The United States Supreme Court held that involuntary administration of the antipsychotic drug denied the defendant due process of law, because the state failed \u201cto establish the need for [the drug] and the medical appropriateness of the drug.\u201d <em>(Riggins </em>v. <em>Nevada, supra, </em>504 U.S. 127, 135 [112 S.Ct. 1810, 1815].) The high court observed: \u201cAlthough we have not had occasion to develop substantive standards for judging forced administration of such drugs in the trial or pretrial settings, Nevada certainly would have satisfied due process if the prosecution had demonstrated, and the District Court had found, that treatment with antipsychotic medication was medically appropriate and, considering less intrusive alternatives, essential for the sake of Riggins\u2019 own safety or the safety of others. [Citations.] Similarly, the State might have been able to justify medically appropriate, involuntary treatment with the drug by establishing that it could not obtain an adjudication of Riggins\u2019 guilt or innocence by using less intrusive means. [Citation.] The question whether a competent criminal defendant may refuse antipsychotic medication if cessation of medication would render him incompetent at trial is not before us.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 135-136 [112 S.Ct. at p. 1815].)</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">Unlike defense counsel in <em>Riggins </em>v. <em>Nevada, supra, </em>504 U.S. 127, the defense in the present case did not move the trial court to suspend administration of defendant\u2019s medication, or otherwise assert in the trial court that defendant was being medicated against his will. To the contrary, during selection of the guilt phase jury, defense counsel stated, regarding the administration of defendant\u2019s medication by jail personnel: \u201cI recognize the jail is doing the best they can, and, I mean, I will encourage any efforts to improve [defendant\u2019s] condition, but my belief is the condition he is in right now is probably the best that we have got.\u201d Defendant may not raise, for the first time on appeal, the claim that he was denied due process of law because antipsychotic drugs were administered to him to control his schizophrenia <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>during the proceedings in the present case. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Lucas </em>(1995) 12 Cal.4th 415, 477 [48 Cal.Rptr.2d 525, 907 P.2d 373].)</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">Even if we were to consider the merits of defendant\u2019s contention, it is clear that the holding in <em>Riggins </em>v. <em>Nevada, supra, </em>504 U.S. 127 does not apply in the present case, because defendant did not refuse the medication and was not forced to take the antipsychotic drug. Nothing in the decision in <em>Riggins </em>v. <em>Nevada, supra, </em>504 U.S. 127, or in any other case of which we are aware, suggests that a competent criminal defendant\u2019s voluntary ingestion of medication that has been provided by the state denies the defendant due process of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">Defendant attempts to avoid this result by observing that in 1985, nearly three years prior to trial, he refused medication for a brief period and was medicated against his will. Defendant argues that, as a result, his subsequent compliance in taking medication must be deemed involuntary. The record before us does not support defendant\u2019s argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-7\">From January 22, 1985, when defendant was transferred to the Sacramento County jail following his arrest, until March of that year, defendant refused medication for his mental illness. On March 10, 1985, the psychiatric staff at the jail had defendant transferred to the psychiatric unit of the jail for 72 hours of observation, because defendant had been pacing in his cell and appeared agitated. Defendant was involuntarily medicated with the antipsychotic drug Haldol but, when returned to a regular cell, refused further medication. Defendant remained unmedicated until July 15, 1985, when he again became agitated, yelling threats, disrobing and standing nude in his cell, and inducing vomiting and spreading the vomitus on the walls. Defendant again was transferred to the psychiatric unit and involuntarily medicated with Haldol. After 14 days, defendant was returned to the regular jail population and agreed to continue his medication voluntarily. To decrease side effects, his medication was changed to the antipsychotic drug Thorazine Prolixin.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-8\">Defendant accepted his medication until April 12, 1988, when his medication was changed to the antipsychotic drug Prolixin and defendant developed diarrhea. Defendant stopped taking the Prolixin, because he concluded it was causing the diarrhea, and asked to be given Navane. On May 13, 1988, defendant\u2019s medication was changed to Loxitane, and he resumed taking his medication.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-9\">As the foregoing illustrates, defendant\u2019s assertion that he \u201cpersistently refused being medicated with antipsychotic drugs\u201d is not supported by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>record. Defendant refused medication only during the first six months following his arrest. During this period, jail officials forcibly medicated him only when it appeared he had become a danger to himself or others. After the first occasion when defendant was medicated forcibly, in May 1985, he refused to continue his medication voluntarily and thereafter was not medicated for several months, until it again appeared he had become a danger to himself or others. After he was medicated forcibly a second time, defendant consented to continue his medication and did so for several years, until April 1988, when he concluded that a change in his medication was causing an unpleasant side effect. Defendant thus demonstrated on two occasions his ability to discontinue his medication. It does not appear, as defendant asserts, that his ingestion of antipsychotic drugs rendered him incapable of refusing such medication. It also is significant that, following his April 1988 refusal to accept medication, he consented to resume treatment when his medication was changed at his request. Defendant thus consented to resume taking antipsychotic drugs, prior to the guilt, sanity, and penalty phases of his trial, at a time when he was unmedicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">Following his initial refusal to accept medication, it appears without contradiction that defendant willingly accepted his medication. While confined in Atascadero State Hospital in late 1985, defendant told Dr. Harold Carmel, a staff psychiatrist, that he needed his medications to stay competent. On October 1, 1987, psychiatrist Dr. Marlene Mirassou, medical director of the psychiatric unit of the Sacramento County jail, examined defendant for the purpose of rendering a second opinion regarding defendant\u2019s medication. Defendant was ingesting 80 milligrams of Navane per day. Dr. Mirassou advised defendant that, at his current dosage, he might have more trouble with side effects such as muscle twitches, but defendant related that when his medication was decreased he had \u201cmore difficulty with the voices.\u201d Defendant indicated \u201che preferred the increased dose and the improved symptoms,\u201d indicating that \u201cthe positive effect of the medication was worth risking the possible side effects.\u201d Dr. Mirassou added: \u201cAnd when I saw Mr. Jones again two weeks later ... we talked about it again, and he gave me the same general idea.\u201d A. member of the jail psychiatric staff reported that on August 10, 1988, defendant told her \u201cthat with the medications the voices are there but they are not as bothersome to him.\u201d Dr. James Peal, a psychiatrist retained by the defense, examined defendant and testified on defendant\u2019s behalf during the competency trial, describing defendant as being \u201cvery insistent upon taking his medication\u201d because it lessens the voices he hears in his head. Accordingly, we have no basis upon which to conclude that defendant was medicated involuntarily with antipsychotic drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">Defendant contends the state bore the burden of proving that defendant gave informed consent to being medicated with antipsychotic drugs. Assuming for the purpose of argument that a person who has not been judicially <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>determined to be incompetent must furnish informed consent before being treated with antipsychotic drugs (cf. <em>Riese </em>v. <em>St. Mary\u2019s Hospital &amp; Medical Center, supra, </em>209 Cal.App.3d 1303, 1320), and assuming further that the state would bear the burden of proving such informed consent in the event the administration of such drugs were challenged, the state bore no such burden in the present case, because defendant did not raise the issue in the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">Defendant asserts that the court in <em>Riggins </em>v. <em>Nevada, supra, </em>504 U.S. 127 held \u201cthat the State may not prosecute a capital defendant who is being medicated with antipsychotic drugs while in its custody, and under color of State authority, without first formally justifying the continued drugging of that defendant during his trial.\u201d The holding in <em>Riggins </em>was not nearly so broad. <em>Riggins </em>simply held that \u201conce Riggins moved to terminate administration of antipsychotic medication, the State became obligated to establish the need for Mellaril and the medical appropriateness of the drug.\u201d <em>(Riggins </em>v. <em>Nevada, supra, </em>504 U.S. 127, 135 [112 S.Ct. 1810, 1815].) Defendant cites no authority, and we are aware of none, that would require the state to demonstrate, sua sponte, that a criminal defendant has furnished informed consent for any antipsychotic medications provided by the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">Defendant contends he was denied due process of law because the state did not accord him the \u201csubstantive and procedural protections\u201d guaranteed by the decisions in <em>Washington </em>v. <em>Harper, supra, </em>494 U.S. 210 and <em>Riggins </em>v. <em>Nevada, supra, </em>504 U.S. 127. <em>Washington </em>v. <em>Harper, supra, </em>494 U.S. 210, 227 [110 S.Ct. 1028, 1039-1040], held that a mentally ill prisoner may be medicated against his will with antipsychotic drugs \u201cif the inmate is dangerous to himself or others and the treatment is in the inmate\u2019s medical interest.\u201d If the inmate refuses such treatment, the state must provide \u201cprocedural protections ... to ensure that the decision to medicate an inmate against his will is neither arbitrary nor erroneous under the standards\u201d discussed above. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 228 [110 S.Ct. at p. 1040].) <em>Riggins </em>v. <em>Nevada, supra, </em>504 U.S. 127, 135 [112 S.Ct. 1810, 1815], held that the rule announced in <em>Harper </em>applies to pretrial detainees. (Cf. <em>Riese </em>v. <em>St. Mary\u2019s Hospital &amp; Medical Center, supra, </em>209 Cal.App.3d 1303, 1308 [patients involuntarily committed to mental health facilities must furnish informed consent to the administration of antipsychotic drugs].)</p>\n<p id=\"b191-7\">Neither <em>Harper </em>nor <em>Riggins </em>held that the procedural protections discussed in those decisions were required when a prisoner or detainee consents to the administration of antipsychotic drugs. The opinion in <em>Harper </em>notes that the defendant initially consented to the administration of antipsychotic drugs. It was only when the defendant later refused to continue the medication, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>the state sought to continue the medication over his objections, that the treatment became involuntary and a hearing was required. <em>(Washington </em>v. <em>Harper, supra, </em>494 U.S. 210, 213-215 [110 S.Ct. at 1028, 1032-1033].) Similarly, the defendant in <em>Riggins </em>initially consented to take an antipsychotic drug, but later moved the trial court to suspend administration of the drug. The United States Supreme Court agreed that \u201conce the District Court denied Riggins\u2019 motion to terminate use of Mellaril, subsequent administration of the drug was involuntary.\u201d <em>(Riggins </em>v. <em>Nevada, supra, </em>504 U.S. 127, 133 [112 S.Ct. 1810, 1814].) Unlike <em>Harper </em>and <em>Riggins, </em>the present case does not involve a defendant who refused his medication, or moved the court to cease his medication, during the guilt, sanity or penalty phases of his trial. When defendant earlier refused his medication, administration of the medication ceased. When defendant refused his medication in 1988, just prior to the guilt phase of his trial, it was changed at his request and was resumed only once he had consented.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">For all of the foregoing reasons, it does not appear that defendant was denied due process of law under the decision in <em>Riggins </em>v. <em>Nevada, supra, </em>504 U.S. 127. For those same reasons, we reject as well defendant\u2019s cursory arguments that his ingestion of antipsychotic drugs denied him his rights, under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, to an individualized and reliable sentencing determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">Defendant further argues that, even if he voluntarily ingested antipsychotic drugs, \u201chis rights to effective assistance of counsel, to present evidence, to testify, to confront witnesses, to due process, to a fair trial, and to a reliable sentencing determination, under the Fifth, Sixth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, were all violated.\u201d Defendant reasons that if a criminal defendant is being administered medication to control a mental illness, \u201cand that medication substantially-interferes with his ability to exercise his constitutionally guaranteed trial rights, the Due Process Clause requires that the State not try that individual while he remains substantially impaired by that medication . . . .\u201d In essence, defendant is arguing that the medication prescribed for him rendered him incompetent to stand trial. As discussed in the previous part of this opinion, a full competency hearing was conducted, after which the jury concluded to the contrary that defendant was competent to stand trial, despite the effects of the medication he was taking. That finding is supported by substantial evidence. We conclude, therefore, that defendant\u2019s voluntary ingestion of antipsychotic drugs during his trial does not warrant reversal of the resulting judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-7\">\n<em>Mental Presence at Trial</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b192-8\">Defendant asserts the judgment must be reversed because he was denied his right to be mentally \u201cpresent\u201d at trial, as guaranteed by section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>1043,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> in that \u201chis mental alertness during trial was severely impaired by a combination of physical stress, mental stress, and the physical and mental effects of having been administered antipsychotic drugs.\u201d Defendant contends the trial court was required to suspend the trial or, at the least, to conduct a hearing to determine whether defendant was mentally \u201cpresent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">Section 1043, subdivision (a), provides: \u201cExcept as otherwise provided in this section, the defendant in a felony case shall be personally present at the trial.\u201d None of the statutory exceptions listed in section 1043 apply in the present case. This court held in <em>In re Dennis </em>(1959) 51 Cal.2d 666, 672 [335 P.2d 657] that the only reasonable interpretation of the \u201c \u2018requirement that a defendant be present at every stage of a felony prosecution is that the accused person must be both physically and mentally present.\u2019 \u201d (Quoting <em>People </em>v. <em>Berlins </em>(1953) 115 Cal.App.2d 255, 267 [251 P.2d 1017].)</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">In the case before us, the question whether the medication administered to defendant rendered him incapable of understanding, and participating in, the court proceedings had been examined in great detail during the competency trial. As noted above, the jury at that trial heard evidence establishing that the medication administered to defendant caused drowsiness, but it also heard evidence suggesting that defendant was malingering. A criminal defendant is incompetent to stand trial \u201cif, as a result of mental disorder or developmental disability, the defendant is unable to understand the nature of the criminal proceedings or to assist counsel in the conduct of a defense in a rational manner.\u201d (\u00a7 1367, subd. (a).) In finding that defendant was competent to stand trial, therefore, the jury necessarily determined that defendant was able to understand the criminal proceedings despite the effects of his medication.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-7\">Although this determination was made prior to trial, defendant does not point to anything in the record indicating that his mental state substantially worsened during the trial. Approximately six weeks after the jury found defendant competent to stand trial, defense counsel noted for the record, \u201cfor whatever value to the proceedings it is relevant,\u201d that defendant had his eyes closed and appeared to be \u201csort of nodding off,\u201d but defense counsel did not request a third competency hearing, apparently concluding that defendant\u2019s apparent drowsiness did not constitute substantial new evidence of incompetence. Approximately six months after the jury found defendant competent to stand trial, defense counsel stated the belief that \u201cthe condition [defendant] is in right now is probably the best that we have got.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b193-8\">Defendant argues that a defendant may be competent under the foregoing definition, but may be denied his right to be mentally \u201cpresent\u201d at trial if the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>defendant\u2019s mental state is impaired \u201cfor any reason other than that he is suffering from a \u2018mental disorder or developmental disability.\u2019 \u201d Assuming arguendo that defendant is correct in this assertion, the present case does not involve such circumstances. Although defendant asserts that his mental alertness was \u201cseverely impaired by a combination of physical stress, mental stress, and the physical and mental effects of having been administered antipsychotic drugs,\u201d he fails to demonstrate that he was under physical or mental stress, or that his mental alertness was impaired by such stress.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">The record before us does not establish that defendant\u2019s alleged lack of alertness during the trial proceedings was real rather than feigned. We do not know whether, or to what extent, defendant slept during court proceedings. The record reflects that defendant was sitting erect with his eyes closed on some occasions and, on one or two occasions, his head was nodding. The trial judge questioned whether defendant\u2019s conduct was deliberate. In light of the jury\u2019s determination that defendant was competent to stand trial, and the absence of any evidence suggesting that defendant\u2019s condition had worsened during the proceedings, the record does not support defendant\u2019s claim that he was denied his right to be mentally \u201cpresent\u201d at the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">\n<em>Burden of Proof of Incompetence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b194-7\">Section 1369, subdivision (f), provides that, at a trial conducted for the purpose of determining a defendant\u2019s competence to stand trial: \u201cIt shall be presumed that the defendant is mentally competent unless it is proved by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant is mentally incompetent.\u201d In <em>People </em>v. <em>Medina </em>(1990) 51 Cal.3d 870, 885 [274 Cal.Rptr. 849, 799 P.2d 1282], we held \u201cthat section 1369 passes constitutional muster under both the federal and state Constitutions.\u201d In <em>Medina </em>v. <em>California </em>(1992) 505 U.S. 437, 452-453 [112 S.Ct. 2572, 2580-2582, 120 L.Ed.2d 353], the United States Supreme Court upheld this court\u2019s ruling that section 1369 does not violate the due process clause of the federal Constitution. (Cf. <em>Cooper </em>v. <em>Oklahoma, supra, </em>517 U.S. _, _ [116 S.Ct. 1373, 1383-1384, 134 L.Ed.2d 498, 515] [a requirement that a criminal defendant prove his incompetence by clear and convincing evidence violates the due process clause of the federal Constitution].)</p>\n<p id=\"b194-8\">Defendant acknowledges that placing upon the defendant in a competency hearing the burden of proving his or her incompetence does not violate the California or federal Constitutions, but he contends that this rule \u201cmust be limited to the situation in which the accused is <em>not </em>being involuntarily medicated with antipsychotic drugs during his competency trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b194-9\">We need not, and do not, determine whether it would be improper to place upon a defendant who is being involuntarily medicated with antipsychotic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>drugs the burden of proving his or her competence because, as discussed above, the record before us affords no basis upon which to conclude that defendant was medicated involuntarily with antipsychotic drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">\n<em>Wheeler Motion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">We held in <em>People </em>v. <em>Wheeler </em>(1978) 22 Cal.3d 258, 276-277 [148 Cal.Rptr. 890, 583 P.2d 748] \u201cthat the use of peremptory challenges to remove prospective jurors on the sole ground of group bias violates the right to trial by a jury drawn from a representative cross-section of the community under article I, section 16, of the California Constitution.\u201d In <em>Batson </em>v. <em>Kentucky </em>(1986) 476 U.S. 79, 96 [106 S.Ct. 1712, 1722-1723, 90 L.Ed.2d 69], the United States Supreme Court held that a prosecutor\u2019s use of peremptory challenges to excuse prospective jurors \u201con account of their race\u201d may violate the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the federal Constitution. (See also <em>J.E.B. </em>v. <em>Alabama </em>ex rel. <em>T.B. </em>(1994) 511 U.S. 127, 128-129 [114 S.Ct. 1419, 1421-1422, 128 L.Ed.2d 89, 97] [peremptory challenges may not be exercised on the basis of gender].)</p>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">\u201cA party who suspects improper use of peremptory challenges must raise a timely objection and make a prima facie showing of strong likelihood that the opponent has excluded one or more jurors on the basis of group or racial identity.

The People concede that, by asking the prosecutor to state his reasons for exercising those peremptory challenges, \u201cthe trial court at least implicitly determined that appellant made a prima facie showing\u201d that the three <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>African-American prospective jurors were excluded on the basis of group bias.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">The prosecutor explained that when the court asked prospective juror Judith Credic whether she could vote to impose the death penalty, she paused three to five seconds and then answered, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d By contrast, when asked whether she could vote to impose life imprisonment without the possibility of parole, she very quickly responded, \u201cYes.\u201d The prosecutor further noted that Credic had a friend who was accused of an aggravated assault and that she expressed hesitation about sitting in judgment of others, particularly if the case involved the death penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">As to prospective juror Donald Haynes, the prosecutor pointed out that both of Haynes\u2019s brothers had been arrested and prosecuted, and one had been convicted of murder. When asked whether he could vote to impose the death penalty, Haynes paused for a long time and then replied, \u201cI think I could.\u201d The prosecutor also observed that Haynes was one of two male jurors who carried a purse.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-7\">The prosecutor indicated it had been difficult to decide whether to challenge prospective juror Audrey Parker, because it was \u201can elimination process\u201d between her and prospective jurors Joanne Blanchette and Donald McKenzie, two Caucasians who remained on the final jury panel. The prosecutor\u2019s main objection to Parker was that she said she would favor a sentence of life in prison without the possibility of parole if there was evidence of insanity. The prosecutor stated: \u201cThat was my primary reason, because I felt that she would cut him slack. None of these other jurors indicated they would cut or favor life without possibility of parole if there was a mental problem, and that is the guts and essence of the defense case here.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b196-8\">The trial court denied the motion, stating, without elaboration, that it found \u201cno <em>Wheeler </em>violation based upon the explanation the District Attorney has given as to each and every one of the three jurors.\u201d  On appeal, defendant does not dispute the trial court\u2019s findings regarding the peremptory challenges to prospective jurors Credic and Haynes, but argues we must conclude that the prosecutor improperly challenged prospective juror Parker on the basis of her race because the prosecutor misrepresented the record of voir dire in explaining why he had Parker excused from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>jury, and because two Caucasian venirepersons who were selected to serve on the jury gave answers during voir dire that were substantially similar to the answers given by Parker.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">Defendant maintains that the prosecutor misstated the record when he asserted that Parker was the only prospective juror who indicated that she would favor a sentence of life in prison without the possibility of parole if there was evidence defendant had a \u201cmental problem.\u201d The record before us does not support defendant\u2019s characterization of the prosecutor\u2019s statement. The prosecutor did not assert, as defendant claims, that Parker was the only prospective juror expressing this view, but stated instead that in comparing Parker with prospective jurors Blanchette and McKenzie, only Parker had said she would \u201cfavor life without possibility of parole if there was a mental problem.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">Parker stated during voir dire that she believed the death penalty was warranted in cases of multiple killings or random killings of innocent people \u201c[i]f there is no insanity.\u201d The defense attorney explained the penalty phase of the case would occur only in the event the jury found defendant legally sane. He then asked, \u201cnow even though you as a juror rejected the idea that the person was insane, would you still be listening, willing to listen to evidence with regard to the person\u2019s mental problems and any mental disease or defect in the penalty phase of the case that is to determine whether or not in your own mind that would mitigate the nature of the crimes,\u201d to which Ms. Parker responded that she would.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-7\">Blanchette\u2019s views were considerably different. Regarding the death penalty, she stated: \u201cWell, I just think that there are some cases that where a person is so mentally disturbed that maybe nothing will be able to enable him to lead a normal life or go back into normal situations besides prison. And in that case maybe it would be wise for the death penalty.\u201d Blanchette later clarified her answer: \u201cI think what I meant to say was that I think the death penalty should be applied only to people who are not mentally ill and who have, you know, premeditated killing and gone out and done it, whereas someone who is mentally ill is really not responsible for what he does.\u201d When questioned by the prosecutor, Blanchette stated she \u201cwould have to be convinced that the person\u2014I guess was not insane\u2014was sane and committed the murder deliberately.\u201d When the prosecutor explained that the penalty phase of the case would occur only in the event the jury found defendant legally sane, she replied: \u201cOkay. If you found him sane, then I would probably say, yes, the death penalty.\u201d Thus, the record appears to support the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>prosecutor\u2019s statement that, as between the two jurors, only Parker indicated she would favor a sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole if there was evidence defendant had a \u201cmental problem.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">Defendant contends that Parker\u2019s answers on voir dire also were \u201cidentical\u201d to those of Ronald Sunberg and Robert Cartwright, two Caucasian men selected for the jury. Defendant concludes that a comparison of the views expressed by Blanchette, Sunberg, and Cartwright with those expressed by Parker compels the conclusion that the prosecutor\u2019s stated reasons for having Parker excused were \u201cdisingenuous.\u201d  We repeatedly have declined to engage in such comparisons. As we explained in <em>People </em>v. <em>Johnson </em>(1989) 47 Cal.3d 1194, 1221 [255 Cal.Rptr. 569, 767 P.2d 1047], \u201cthe very dynamics of the jury selection process make it difficult, if not impossible, on a cold record, to evaluate or compare the peremptory challenge of one juror with the retention of another juror which on paper appears to be substantially similar.\u201d We reiterated this point in <em>People </em>v. <em>Montiel, supra, </em>5 Cal.4th 877, 909: \u201cIf the trial court makes a \u2018sincere and reasoned effort\u2019 to evaluate the nondiscriminatory justifications offered, its conclusions are entitled to deference on appeal. In such circumstances, an appellate court will not reassess good faith by conducting its own comparative juror analysis. Such an approach would undermine the trial court\u2019s credibility determinations and would discount \u2018\u201dthe variety of [subjective] factors and considerations,\u201d \u2019 including \u2018prospective jurors\u2019 body language or manner of answering questions,\u2019 which legitimately inform a trial lawyer\u2019s decision to exercise peremptory challenges. [Citations.]\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">As the United States Supreme Court has observed: \u201cDeference to trial court findings on the issue of discriminatory intent makes particular sense in this context because, as we noted in <em>Batson, </em>the finding \u2018largely will turn on evaluation of credibility.\u2019 476 U.S., at 98, n. 21. In the typical peremptory challenge inquiry, the decisive question will be whether counsel\u2019s race-neutral explanation for a peremptory challenge should be believed. There will seldom be much evidence bearing on that issue, and the best evidence often will be the demeanor of the attorney who exercises the challenge. As with the state of mind of a juror, evaluation of the prosecutor\u2019s state of mind based on demeanor and credibility lies \u2018peculiarly within a trial judge\u2019s province.\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Hernandez </em>v. <em>New York </em>(1991) 500 U.S. 352, 365 [11 S.Ct. 1859, 1869, 114 L.Ed.2d 395].)</p>\n<p id=\"b198-7\">Even if we were to engage in a comparative analysis of the responses given by the prospective jurors, defendant would not prevail. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>above quoted excerpts from the voir dire of prospective jurors Parker and Blanchette demonstrate that the prosecutor had a reasonable basis for concluding that Blanchette might have been more likely than Parker to vote for the death penalty in the present case. Similarly, prospective juror Sunberg stated that he felt the death penalty was appropriate for \u201ca person of sound mind and body . . . that knows exactly what he is doing and kills somebody cold blooded, that is the worst kind of killing there is,\u201d but he did not rule out the death penalty in other situations, stating he \u201cjust got to go with the details.\u201d Sunberg later added that life in prison without the possibility of parole would be appropriate \u201c[i]f a person kills by reason of insanity and is a threat to the life of others.\u201d He clarified that such a sentence would be appropriate if the defendant \u201cdidn\u2019t know what the hell he was doing.\u201d Prospective juror Cartwright stated the death penalty would be appropriate if a person killed deliberately, and acknowledged \u201cthat a person that is mentally ill is not necessarily capable of reasonably thinking about what he is doing.\u201d Like Blanchette, neither Sunberg nor Cartwright stated he would consider mental illness not amounting to insanity as a mitigating factor in considering whether to impose the death penalty. On this record, the trial court properly could find that the reasons advanced by the prosecutor for exercising a peremptory challenge against Parker were not mere pretexts intended to conceal a motive of racial bias.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">\n<em>Excusing Prospective Jurors for Cause</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">Defendant contends the trial court erred in excusing for cause prospective jurors Betty Melvin and Ronald Beeler on the ground that they indicated on voir dire they would be unable to vote to impose the death penalty.

The court held that the standard for determining whether such a challenge for cause is proper is \u201cwhether the juror\u2019s views would \u2018prevent or substantially impair the performance of his duties as a juror in accordance with his instructions and his oath.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 424 [105 S.Ct. at p. 852], fn. omitted.)

[T]his is why deference must be paid to the trial, judge who sees and hears the juror.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 425-426 [105 S.Ct. at pp. 852-853].)</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">Applying the above standard, we stated in <em>People </em>v. <em>Fudge </em>(1994) 7 Cal.4th 1075, 1094 [31 Cal.Rptr.2d 321, 875 P.2d 36]: \u201cIn many cases, a prospective juror\u2019s responses to questions on voir dire will be halting, equivocal, or even conflicting. Given the juror\u2019s probable unfamiliarity with the complexity of the law, coupled with the stress and anxiety of being a prospective juror in a capital case, such equivocation should be expected. Under such circumstances, we defer to the trial court\u2019s evaluation of a prospective juror\u2019s state of mind, and such evaluation is binding on appellate courts. [Citations.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">During voir dire in the present case, the trial court recited a portion of the jury instruction regarding the consideration of aggravating and mitigating circumstances in determining whether to impose the death penalty, and asked prospective juror Melvin whether she \u201ccould vote for the death penalty\u201d if she \u201cfelt that the penalty was appropriate.\u201d Melvin answered: \u201cI don\u2019t know whether I could or not. I don\u2019t feel that I would have the right to do that.\u201d After indicating she believed that only God has \u201cthe right to life and death,\u201d the court asked Melvin whether she could vote to impose the death penalty, and she answered: \u201cI don\u2019t think I could. I really don\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b200-7\">Defense counsel then questioned Melvin at some length regarding whether she could consider voting to impose the death penalty. Near the end of this portion of the voir dire, Melvin stated: \u201cI know what you are trying to get me to say, but I just, I don\u2019t feel in my heart that I would be qualified. I am only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>a person, not God, and I don\u2019t want to be able to say, well, he could live or die no matter what had happened, what he did.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">Upon being questioned by the prosecutor, Melvin stated that, given a choice between the death penalty and life in prison without parole, she always would choose life in prison. Over defendant\u2019s objection, the trial court granted the prosecutor\u2019s challenge for cause to Melvin.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">Prospective juror Beeler told the court that, because of his religious convictions, he could not, under any circumstances, vote to impose the death penalty. Upon being questioned by defense counsel, however, Beeler indicated that \u201cin the case of Charles Manson\u201d or \u201cJimmie Jones\u201d he might be persuaded to vote for the death penalty. Beeler also stated he could follow the law regarding the death penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-7\">When the prosecutor asked whether Beeler\u2019s \u201cability to sit on a death penalty case would be impaired from the standpoint of being able to return a death verdict in an appropriate case,\u201d Beeler answered: \u201cI think that states it clearly. It would be impaired. It wouldn\u2019t be impossible, but it would be strongly impaired.\u201d After substantial additional questioning by the court and both parties, Beeler stated that he would vote for the death penalty only \u201c[ujnder great duress,\u201d explaining that he \u201cwould lean strongly toward life without the possibility of parole over the death penalty.\u201d Over defendant\u2019s objection, the court granted the prosecutor\u2019s challenge for cause to Beeler.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-8\">Under the foregoing standards, the trial court did not err in excusing for cause prospective jurors Melvin and Beeler. Both Melvin and Beeler repeatedly indicated that their beliefs against the death penalty would prevent or substantially impair them from determining whether the death penalty should be imposed in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-9\">\n<em>Separate Penalty Jury</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b201-10\">Prior to trial, the trial court denied defendant\u2019s motion for a separate jury for the penalty phase of the trial, should a penalty phase become necessary. Defendant argues on appeal that he was denied his right to an impartial jury during the penalty phase, because the jury that had found him guilty during the guilt phase could not be impartial during the penalty phase, and because, during the sanity phase of the trial, the jury was exposed to evidence of defendant\u2019s antisocial conduct that was inadmissible as evidence in aggravation at the penalty phase. We have considered and rejected similar claims on several occasions. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Bacigalupo </em>(1991) 1 Cal.4th 103, 135-136 [2 Cal.Rptr.2d 335, 820 P.2d 559]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Ashmus </em>(1991) 54 Cal.3d 932, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>956-957 [2 Cal.Rptr.2d 112, 820 P.2d 214]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Fields </em>(1983) 35 Cal.3d 329, 353 [197 Cal.Rptr. 803, 673 P.2d 680].)</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">Defendant relies upon the holding in <em>Leonard </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1964) 378 U.S. 544 [84 S.Ct. 1696, 12 L.Ed.2d 1028] that prospective jurors who heard a guilty verdict rendered against the defendant should have been disqualified to sit as jurors in an unrelated prosecution of similar charges against that defendant. The decision in <em>Leonard </em>obviously is distinguishable from the present case. A panel of prospective jurors that hears a verdict of guilty rendered in an unrelated case has received evidence of an uncharged crime that could result in substantial prejudice. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Ewoldt </em>(1994) 7 Cal.4th 380, 404 [27 Cal.Rptr.2d 646, 867 P.2d 757].) In the present case, the jury did not learn of a verdict rendered in another case, but simply returned a verdict of guilty in the present case. Without a determination that defendant was guilty, neither a sanity nor a penalty phase would be possible or necessary. It cannot plausibly be asserted that knowledge that the defendant has been found guilty of the charged offense disqualifies the jury from considering the appropriate penalty for that offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">As noted, defendant further contends that he was entitled to a separate jury for the penalty phase because, during the sanity phase, the jury heard evidence of defendant\u2019s antisocial behavior that would have been inadmissible during the penalty phase. Defendant does not specify, however, what evidence, if any, introduced during the sanity phase would have been inadmissible during the penalty phase, stating only that defendant\u2019s \u201cantisocial behavior would not be admissible as an aggravating circumstance under Penal Code section 190.3(a)-(c),\u201d which concerns the admissibility of .evidence of prior criminal conduct.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Contrary to defendant\u2019s contention, it appears that the evidence of defendant\u2019s antisocial conduct admitted during the sanity phase would have been admissible during the penalty phase pursuant to section 190.3, factor (h), which allows the jury to consider during the penalty phase \u201c[w]hether or not at the time of the offense the capacity of the defendant to appreciate the criminality of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of law was impaired as a result of mental disease or defect. . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b202-7\">The evidence of defendant\u2019s antisocial conduct to which defendant apparently refers was admitted during the sanity phase to rebut defendant\u2019s claim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>that he was not guilty by reason of insanity due to the effect of his schizophrenia. The prosecution, in countering that defendant was exaggerating the effects of his illness, presented evidence of defendant\u2019s antisocial conduct to demonstrate that his crime was a result of his antisocial personality rather than his schizophrenia. It appears that this evidence would have been admissible at the penalty phase for the same purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">Even if evidence was admitted during the sanity phase that would have been inadmissible during the penalty phase, defendant\u2019s proper remedy was to request a limiting instruction directing the jury to disregard such evidence during the penalty phase.  In <em>People </em>v. <em>Fields, supra, </em>35 Cal.3d 329, 351-352, we recognized that important interests were served by having a single jury consider the defendant\u2019s guilt of a capital offense and the appropriate penalty. Because the penalty jury must consider the circumstances of the crime, having a separate penalty phase jury would necessitate repeating a substantial portion of the evidence introduced during the guilt phase. \u201cIn this context, moreover, the preference for a single jury goes well beyond considerations of administrative convenience or expense and reflects a legitimate attempt to assure\u2014insofar as possible\u2014that the decision-making process of a death penalty case is a coherent whole. The preference for a single jury is by no means a one-sided matter; such a procedure may provide distinct benefits for both the prosecution and the defense. . . . From defendant\u2019s perspective, the use of a single jury may help insure that the ultimate decision-maker in capital cases acts with full recognition of the gravity of its responsibility throughout both phases of the trial and will also guarantee that the penalty phase jury is aware of lingering doubts that may have survived the guilt phase deliberations. [Citation.] Thus, there are a number of weighty considerations to support the statutory preference for a single jury in capital cases.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 352.)  Defendant was not entitled to a separate jury during the penalty phase.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">\n<em>Prosecutorial Misconduct</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AU-\">\n<em>Guilt Phase</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b203-7\">Defendant contends the prosecutor committed numerous acts of misconduct during the guilt, sanity, and penalty phases of the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-8\">During his argument at the close of the guilt phase, defense counsel asserted that the prosecution had failed to prove that the perpetrator of the alleged offenses acted with intent to kill, because there was no apparent motive for the attacks. Defense counsel stated: \u201cRight now as all of you are sitting here not one of you knows why any of those people were killed. That <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>is a failure of proof with regard to the prosecutor.\u201d The prosecutor objected and asked that the jury be instructed that motive is not an element of the crime, adding that defense counsel \u201cknows he\u2019s lying to this jury.\u201d The court instructed the jury that motive is not an element of the crime, at which point defense counsel asked that the prosecutor be admonished for accusing defense counsel of being a liar. The court instructed the jury \u201cto disregard what all the attorneys are saying now, only to consider what they are say [sic] during their arguments.\u201d At the close of defense counsel\u2019s argument, the court, outside the presence of the jury and at defense counsel\u2019s request, ordered the prosecutor to \u201crefrain from calling the others liars during arguments.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">The prosecutor, in his closing argument, referred to defense counsel\u2019s argument that the prosecutor had failed to prove a motive for the crimes, stating: \u201cNow I don\u2019t think that Mr. Morris was deliberately trying to mislead you, but, let\u2019s face it, folks he wasn\u2019t being ultimately candid with you in what the law really does require. And that is too bad. It damaged his credibility, that comment.\u201d Defense counsel objected that the prosecutor\u2019s argument misstated the evidence, and the court stated: \u201cThat\u2019s not proper argument.\u201d In response to defense counsel\u2019s request for \u201can admonition,\u201d the court stated: \u201cThe jury is admonished to disregard any personal comments made by either side\u201d and added the directive, apparently aimed at the prosecutor, to \u201c[sjtick to the facts.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">It was improper for the prosecutor to accuse opposing counsel of lying to the jury and to state that defense counsel\u2019s credibility was damaged because he was not candid with the jury <em>(People </em>v. <em>Cummings </em>(1993) 4 Cal.4th 1233, 1302 [18 Cal.Rptr.2d 796, 850 P.2d 1]), but the trial court sustained defendant\u2019s objections and, on both occasions, instructed the jury to disregard the comments. We assume the jury followed this instruction, and that any prejudice thus was avoided. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Wash </em>(1993) 6 Cal.4th 215, 263 [24 Cal.Rptr.2d 421, 861 P.2d 1107].)</p>\n<p id=\"b204-7\">\n<em>Sanity Phase</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b204-8\">Defendant contends the prosecutor committed misconduct under the holdings in <em>Wainwright </em>v. <em>Greenfield </em>(1986) 474 U.S. 284 [106 S.Ct. 634, 88 L.Ed.2d 623], <em>Doyle </em>v. <em>Ohio </em>(1976) 426 U.S. 610 [96 S.Ct. 2240, 49 L.Ed.2d 91], and <em>Griffin </em>v. <em>California </em>(1965) 380 U.S. 609 [85 S.Ct. 1229, 14 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>L.Ed.2d 106], by eliciting from defense witnesses on cross-examination testimony indicating that defendant had stated to jail personnel that he would not speak to them on advice of his attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">During the sanity phase of the trial, defendant called as a witness Dr. Audrey Mertz, a psychiatrist at the Sacramento County jail, who treated defendant following his arrest. Dr. Mertz testified that when defendant was booked into the jail on January 23, 1985, the jail guards requested a psychiatric evaluation of defendant because he was slow to respond to the booking process and would not speak. During his first few months in jail, defendant continued to be uncommunicative and withdrawn and engaged in bizarre behavior, causing Dr. Mertz to diagnose defendant as suffering from chronic undifferentiated schizophrenia.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">In an attempt to demonstrate that defendant was malingering by exaggerating his illness, the prosecutor elicited from Dr. Mertz on cross-examination testimony indicating that jail personnel suspected defendant was malingering because he appeared more relaxed and talkative when members of the psychiatric staff were not present. The following colloquy then occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-7\">\u201c[The Prosecutor]: Now you knew, of course, that from day one on January 23rd, 1985, when your jail psychiatric staff first wanted to see Mr. Jones, that he essentially told them in no uncertain terms that he did not want to talk with them?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-8\">\u201c[Dr. Mertz]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-9\">\u201cQ. And, in fact, that is documented in your nursing reports; isn\u2019t it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-10\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-11\">\u201cQ. And, in fact, he says specifically, \u2018I\u2019m not going to answer your questions and I am simply not going to talk to you people;\u2019 right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-12\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-13\">\u201cQ. And he continued that for a long period of time; didn\u2019t he?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-14\">\u201cA. Yes, sir.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b205-15\">Over defendant\u2019s objection, the prosecutor then was permitted to ask the following questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-16\">\u201c[The Prosecutor]: Doctor Mertz, as of January 23rd, 1985, the day after the defendant was arrested, he was approached by a nurse by the name of Peterson who worked in the jail psychiatric services; is that true?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-5\">\u201cQ. And on January 23rd, 1985, didn\u2019t Mr. Jones tell Ms. Peterson that, T am not going to talk to you. My lawyers told me not to talk to you and I\u2019m not going to answer any of your questions\u2019?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-6\">\u201cA. That is the note she wrote.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b206-7\">The prosecutor also asked psychiatric nurse Gillian Rumsey on cross-examination whether she knew that defendant had stated on the day after his arrest that his lawyer had told him not to answer questions. Nurse Rumsey said she was aware of that statement and agreed that she had no way of knowing whether defendant had been unwilling or unable to communicate with her.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-8\">On cross-examination of psychiatrist Dr. Captane Thomson regarding whether defendant was malingering, the following occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-9\">\u201c[The Prosecutor]: Doctor, on the subject of the defendant\u2019s elective muteness after his arrest, that was his conscious choice not to talk to people; wasn\u2019t it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-10\">\u201cA. It was a conscious choice, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-11\">\u201cQ. And, in fact, on January 23rd of 1985, he made it very, very clear that he was not going to talk to anybody while he was in jail on the advice of counsel; isn\u2019t that true?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-12\">\u201cA. Yes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b206-13\">The United States Supreme Court, in <em>Griffin </em>v. <em>California, supra, </em>380 U.S. 609, held that the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination forbids the prosecution from arguing, and the court from instructing the jury, that a defendant\u2019s failure to testify is evidence of the defendant\u2019s guilt. <em>Doyle </em>v. <em>Ohio, supra, </em>426 U.S. 610, held that a defendant\u2019s silence following the giving of <em>Miranda </em>warnings<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> could not be used to impeach the defendant\u2019s testimony at trial. The high court held: \u201cSilence in the wake of these warnings may be nothing more than the arrestee\u2019s exercise of these <em>Miranda </em>rights. . . . Moreover, while it is true that the <em>Miranda </em>warnings contain no express assurance that silence will carry no penalty, such assurance is implicit to any person who receives the warnings.\u201d (426 U.S. at pp. 617-618 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>[96 S.Ct. at pp. 2244-2245].) In <em>Wainwright </em>v. <em>Greenfield, supra, </em>474 U.S. 284, the high court held that the prosecution could not attempt to disprove the defendant\u2019s claim that he was insane at the time of the alleged offense by introducing evidence that the defendant, following his arrest, understood the <em>Miranda </em>warnings and invoked his rights to remain silent and obtain counsel. The high court stated: \u201cThe point of the <em>Doyle </em>holding is that it is fundamentally unfair to promise an arrested person that his silence will not be used against him and thereafter to breach that promise by using the silence to impeach his trial testimony. It is equally unfair to breach that promise by using silence to overcome a defendant\u2019s plea of insanity. In both situations, the State gives warnings to protect constitutional rights and implicitly promises that any exercise of those rights will not be penalized. In both situations, the State then seeks to make use of the defendant\u2019s exercise of those rights in obtaining his conviction.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 292 [106 S.Ct. at p. 639].)</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">The People, citing <em>Fletcher </em>v. <em>Weir </em>(1982) 455 U.S. 603, 607 [102 S.Ct. 1309, 1312, 71 L.Ed.2d 490], contend that defendant has failed to demonstrate that the holdings in <em>Doyle </em>and <em>Greenfield </em>apply in the present case, because he has not established that he was given <em>Miranda </em>warnings following his arrest.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Defendant counters that \u201cthe holding in <em>Fletcher </em>v. <em>Weir, supra, </em>does not apply where the defendant objects to cross-examination <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>about his having made a statement invoking his right to silence.\u201d (Italics omitted.) Defendant further asserts that the holding in <em>Fletcher </em>v. <em>Weir </em>does not apply if the defendant does not testify at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">We need not, and do not, resolve this dispute, because we conclude that even if defendant had been given <em>Miranda </em>warnings at the time of his arrest, it still would have been proper for the prosecution\u2014by introducing evidence that defendant consciously chose to remain silent\u2014to attempt to rebut defendant\u2019s assertion that his mental illness rendered him incapable of communicating. Because defendant had introduced evidence of his uncommunicativeness as alleged proof that he suffered from a mental illness, the prosecution was entitled to impeach or rebut such an inference by presenting to the jury evidence that established a different explanation for defendant\u2019s lack of communication. The prosecution\u2019s ability, in such circumstances, to show the reason for defendant\u2019s silence should be no less than it would be had the prosecution introduced evidence that defendant had taken a vow of silence or suffered from laryngitis.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">In <em>United States </em>v. <em>Robinson </em>(1988) 485 U.S. 25 [108 S.Ct. 864, 99 L.Ed.2d 23], defense counsel had urged in closing argument that the government had not allowed the defendant to explain his side of the story. The prosecutor during his summation informed the jury that respondent \u201c \u2018could have taken the stand and explained it to you ....\u2019\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 28 [108 S. Ct. at p. 867].) The federal court of appeals reversed the resulting judgment of conviction on the ground that the prosecutor had committed <em>Griffin </em>error by commenting upon the defendant\u2019s exercise of his right to remain silent.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-7\">The United States Supreme Court disagreed: \u201cWe hold that the prosecutor\u2019s statement that respondent could have explained to the jury his story did not in the light of the comments by defense counsel infringe upon respondent\u2019s Fifth Amendment rights. The Court of Appeals and respondent apparently take the view that any \u2018direct\u2019 reference by the prosecutor to the failure of the defendant to testify violates the Fifth Amendment as construed in <em>Griffin. </em>We decline to give <em>Griffin </em>such a broad reading .... We think there is considerable difference for purposes of the privilege against compulsory self-incrimination between the sort of comments involved in <em>Griffin </em>and the comments involved in this case. [^Q ... In the present case it is evident that the prosecutorial comment did not treat the defendant\u2019s silence as substantive evidence of guilt, but instead referred to the possibility of testifying as one of several opportunities which the defendant was afforded, contrary to the statement of his counsel, to explain his side of the case. Where the prosecutor on his own initiative asks the jury to draw an adverse inference from a defendant\u2019s silence, <em>Griffin </em>holds that the privilege against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>compulsory self-incrimination is violated. <em>But where as in this case the prosecutor\u2019s reference to the defendant\u2019s opportunity to testify is a fair response to a claim made by defendant or his counsel, we think there is no violation of the privilege,\u201d (United States </em>v. <em>Robinson, supra, </em>485 U.S. at pp. 31-32 [108 S.Ct. at pp. 868-869], italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">The high court explained further: \u201c \u2018[The] central purpose of a criminal trial is to decide the factual question of the defendant\u2019s guilt or innocence, [citation]. . . .\u2019 [Citation.] To this end it is important that both the defendant and the prosecutor have the opportunity to meet fairly the evidence and arguments of one another. The broad dicta in <em>Griffin </em>to the effect that the Fifth Amendment \u2018forbids . . . comment by the prosecution on the accused\u2019s silence,\u2019 380 U.S., at 615, must be taken in the light of the facts of that case. It is one thing to hold, as we did in <em>Griffin, </em>that the prosecutor may not treat a defendant\u2019s exercise of his right to remain silent at trial as substantive evidence of guilt; it is quite another to urge, as defendant does here, that the same reasoning would prohibit the prosecutor from fairly responding to an argument of the defendant by adverting to that silence. There may be some \u2018cost\u2019 to the defendant in having remained silent in each situation, but we decline to expand <em>Griffin </em>to preclude a fair response by the prosecutor in situations such as the present one.\u201d <em>(United States </em>v. <em>Robinson, supra, </em>485 U.S. 25, 33-34 [108 S.Ct. 864, 869-870].)</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Austin </em>(1994) 23 Cal.App.4th 1596 [28 Cal.Rptr.2d 885], a deputy sheriff testified that the defendant made a damaging admission shortly after his arrest and prior to being given <em>Miranda </em>advisements. On cross-examination, defense counsel elicited from the deputy that, when the defendant made this remark, the deputy did not ask him whether he would care to make \u201ca full and complete statement.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1610.) On redirect examination, the prosecutor asked the deputy whether he later gave the defendant the opportunity to make a full statement. The deputy responded that he had by advising the defendant of his <em>Miranda </em>rights, but that the defendant had declined to make a further statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-7\">The defendant argued on appeal that the prosecutor\u2019s reference to his <em>post-Miranda </em>silence violated his right to due process under <em>Griffin </em>and <em>Doyle. </em>The Court of Appeal disagreed, observing: <em>\u201cGriffin </em>and <em>Doyle </em>were cases in which the prosecution sought to take unfair advantage of the defendant\u2019s silence. . . . These cases stand for the principle it is fundamentally unfair for the state to afford defendants the right to remain silent and then use that silence against them. It must be remembered, however, the defendant\u2019s right to remain silent is a shield. <em>It cannot be used as a sword to cut off the prosecution\u2019s fair response\u2019 to the evidence or argument of the </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number><em>defendant. </em>[Citation.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Austin, supra, </em>23 Cal.App.4th 1596, 1611-1612, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">The court in <em>Austin </em>explained that the defendant had \u201csought to create the impression in the jurors\u2019 minds the police had treated him unfairly by not giving him the opportunity to explain his damaging statement . . . and to use the fact he had invoked his right to remain silent to prevent the prosecutor from countering this impression. The Fifth Amendment protects defendant\u2019s right to remain silent. It does not protect his effort to exploit his silence by requiring the government also remain silent. Here, the prosecutor\u2019s purpose on redirect examination of [the deputy sheriff] was to correct the impression created on cross-examination Austin had not been afforded an opportunity to explain the apparently damaging statement he made to [the deputy]. There was no attempt to suggest defendant\u2019s invocation of his right to remain silent was substantive evidence of guilt or to impeach a defense by bringing out Austin\u2019s postarrest silence. The rationale of <em>Griffin </em>and <em>Doyle </em>is inapplicable.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Austin, supra, </em>23 Cal.App.4th 1596, 1612-1613.)</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">The present case does not involve the type of circumstances <em>to </em>which the rule announced in <em>Doyle, </em>and applied in <em>Greenfield, </em>was intended to apply. Unlike the prosecution\u2019s action in <em>Doyle, </em>the prosecution here did not use defendant\u2019s silence at the time of his arrest to show that his testimony at trial was recently fabricated. Unlike <em>Greenfield, </em>the present case did not involve an attempt by the prosecution to use defendant\u2019s invocation of his right to remain silent to show that defendant possessed the mental acuity to understand his constitutional rights. Rather, the prosecution introduced the evidence in question to show that defendant\u2019s silence while incarcerated at the county jail was not probative of the extent of defendant\u2019s mental illness, as the defense claimed, because\u2014as defendant\u2019s own statement to one of the psychiatric nurses indicated\u2014defendant simply had chosen not to speak to the psychiatric personnel at the jail. This highly relevant evidence, responding to a claim put forward by defendant, was not rendered inadmissible simply because it revealed that defendant indicated that he chose not to speak in reliance upon his constitutional right to remain silent, rather than for some other reason.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b210-7\">Defendant also contends that the following portions of the prosecutor\u2019s argument during the sanity phase constituted misconduct, because they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>denigrated defense counsel: \u201c[The Prosecutor]: I am tired and bored. . . . [50 [Defense counsel] didn\u2019t talk about the law an awful lot. He started off by kind of referring you to this definition and he got lost right at the start of his argument, and the reason why, he doesn\u2019t understand the law. He doesn\u2019t understand how it works. And he doesn\u2019t understand what it really means. [1 Perhaps I can help.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">A short time later, the prosecutor addressed defense counsel, stating: \u201cI heard you talking up here for an hour and a half and I sat through two weeks of this trial and the best you have done is prove to me that this guy has some kind of problem.\u201d The prosecutor later added: \u201c[T]here is nowhere in the law of California here that says you have got to have logical reasons in order to be found sane, or, in the alternative, if your reasons are irrational, you are insane. That is not the law. It is not in there. [\u00b6] [Defense counsel] would like it to be. But it is not. That\u2019s just not the law, and we know why.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">Defendant did not object to any of these remarks and, accordingly, is \u201cdeemed to have waived the objection and the point cannot be raised on appeal.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Green, supra, </em>27 Cal.3d 1, 27.) In any event, none of these comments constituted misconduct.  \u201cA prosecutor may \u2018vigorously argue his case and is not limited to \u201cChesterfieldian politeness\u201d \u2019 [citation] . . . .\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Fosselman </em>(1983) 33 Cal.3d 572, 580 [189 Cal.Rptr. 855, 659 P.2d 1144].) It did not constitute misconduct for the prosecutor to assert that defense counsel\u2019s argument reflected a misunderstanding of the relevant law.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-7\">Defendant next contends that the following portion of the prosecutor\u2019s argument during the sanity phase constituted misconduct: \u201cAll of us know, we have seen people on the streets who are goofy, who were bizarre, who act funny, who did a lot of bizarre things that this defendant has done. We know, probably if you read today\u2019s paper that about a third of our population has some type of mental problem or mental illness. It is fairly well established. Does that mean that everybody that has a problem automatically gets a free pass on three or four murders? I think most of us would say no, that kind of defies common sense. And I think something more than just proving up that a person has a problem should be required before we give him a free pass.\u201d The prosecutor later returned to this theme, stating: \u201cPeople do an awful lot of strange things. They have mental problems. Does that give them a free pass to go out and murder? Is that it?\u201d Defense counsel objected, for the first time, stating: \u201cThere is no free pass on this even on a not guilty by reason of insanity.\u201d The trial court sustained the objection. The prosecutor continued: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>\u201cDoes that mean they can avoid criminal responsibility for their crimes? The answer is clearly no.\u201d Thereafter, the prosecutor, on numerous occasions, spoke of avoiding criminal responsibility, rather than receiving a free pass.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">We recognized in <em>People </em>v. <em>Babbitt </em>(1988) 45 Cal.3d 660, 702-703 [248 Cal.Rptr. 69, 755 P.2d 253] that it is proper for a prosecutor to argue that a finding that a defendant had diminished capacity at the time of the offense would \u201c \u2018absolve . . . [the defendant] of all criminal responsibility\u2019 \u201d because \u201cthe purpose and effect of a successful diminished capacity defense is to reduce or absolve the defendant\u2019s criminal responsibility.\u201d (Italics omitted.) We also held that it was proper for the prosecutor to argue that a finding that a defendant was insane at the time of the offense would let him \u201coff the hook\u201d because \u201c[a]n accused who is found to have been insane is absolved of criminal responsibility [citations], and thus, in the colloquial, is \u2018let off the hook.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 703.)</p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">In the present case, the prosecutor\u2019s suggestion\u2014that finding defendant had been insane at the time of the offense would give him a \u201cfree pass\u201d to commit murder\u2014had the same effect as suggesting that such a finding would let defendant \u201coff the hook.\u201d We observed in <em>People </em>v. <em>Babbitt, supra, </em>45 Cal.3d 660, 703-704, that arguing that finding defendants not guilty by reason of insanity leaves them \u201c \u2018free to commit any crime they want\u2019 \u201d is not improper, because \u201c[i]n asserting that they thus would be \u2018free\u2019 to commit a crime, the prosecutor was referring not to a freedom from confinement, but to the freedom from criminal responsibility that follows from a finding of insanity.\u201d (Italics omitted.) The same is true regarding the prosecutor\u2019s reference in the present case to giving defendant a \u201cfree pass\u201d to commit murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-7\">To the extent that the prosecutor\u2019s use of the phrase \u201cfree pass\u201d could have been understood by the jury to imply incorrectly that defendant would be set free if he was found not guilty by reason of insanity, any such error would not require reversal of the judgment. As discussed above, these few brief references were ambiguous at worst and did not clearly state that defendant would be set free. Defendant\u2019s \u201cspeaking\u201d objection noted that \u201c[t]here is no free pass on this even on a not guilty by reason of insanity.\u201d The trial court sustained the objection and the prosecutor did not use the phrase again, referring instead to whether defendant would avoid criminal responsibility. The prosecutor thus clarified that his earlier use of the ambiguous phrase \u201cfree pass\u201d meant no more than avoiding criminal responsibility. It is not reasonably probable that, in the absence of any such error, the jury would have returned a finding more favorable to defendant. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Babbitt, supra, </em>45 Cal.3d 660, 704.)</p>\n<p id=\"b213-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>Defendant further argues that, in light of the prosecutor\u2019s admonition not to give defendant a \u201cfree pass\u201d by finding him not guilty by reason of insanity, the trial court was required, sua sponte, to instruct the jury in accordance with CALJIC No. 4.01, which explains that a verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity would not result in the defendant\u2019s immediate release.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> In the alternative, defendant argues his counsel was ineffective for failing to request this instruction. We find neither argument persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">Defense counsel in the present case submitted two proposed jury instructions based upon CALJIC No. 4.01. The first of these incorporated verbatim the text of CALJIC No. 4.01. The second proposed instruction, which defense counsel preferred, modified the text of CALJIC No. 4.01 to replace the term \u201csanity\u201d with the phrase \u201cmental health,\u201d so as to state that if defendant were found not guilty by reason of insanity, he would remain in confinement \u201cwhile the courts determine whether he has fully recovered his mental health\u201d and would not be released \u201cunless and until the court determines and finds the defendant\u2019s mental health has been fully restored, in accordance with the law of California . . . .\u201d Defense counsel proposed this modified version of CALJIC No. 4.01 because section 1026.2 states that a defendant may be released when his or her \u201csanity has been restored,\u201d which is defined to mean that the defendant \u201cis no longer a danger to the health and safety of others, due to mental defect, disease, or disorder.\u201d Defense counsel was concerned that this definition of \u201csanity\u201d differed from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>the definition given to the jury in the sanity phase instructions that \u201c[a] person is legally insane when by reason of mental disease or mental defect he was incapable of knowing or understanding the nature and quality of his act or incapable of distinguishing right from wrong. . . .\u201d Defense counsel believed that CALJIC No. 4.01 might lead the jury to believe that, if defendant presently was capable of distinguishing right from wrong, a verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity could lead to his immediate release.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">The trial court stated that the term \u201cmental health\u201d did not have a precise meaning, and gave defense counsel until the following morning to propose an alternate term. The following morning, defense counsel withdrew the proposed instruction that incorporated verbatim the text of CALJIC No. 4.01 and urged the court to give the proposed modified instruction using the term \u201cmental health.\u201d The court refused to give the proposed instruction as modified. Defendant does not claim on appeal that the trial court erred in refusing to give this proposed modified instruction, but argues the trial court should have instructed the jury, sua sponte, in accordance with CALJIC No. 4.01.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">The trial court did not err in failing to give, sua sponte, an instruction based upon the text of CALJIC No. 4.01, after defendant withdrew his request for such an instruction. The premise of defendant\u2019s argument, that an instruction based upon CALJIC No. 4.01 was necessitated by the prosecutor\u2019s misconduct in using the phrase \u201cfree pass,\u201d fails because, as explained above, the prosecutor\u2019s use of that phrase did not constitute misconduct. Additionally, the issue is not whether the court had a duty to so instruct in the absence of a request by defendant, but whether the court had a duty to instruct after defendant clearly indicated he did not want such an instruction by withdrawing his request for it. Defendant cites no authority for the proposition that a trial <em>court </em>must, or should, give such an instruction against the wishes of the defendant. We decline to adopt such a rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-7\">We also conclude that defense counsel was not ineffective in withdrawing his request for a jury instruction based upon the text of CALJIC No. 4.01.  \u201cReviewing courts defer to counsel\u2019s reasonable tactical decisions in examining a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel [citation], and there is a \u2018strong presumption that counsel\u2019s conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance.\u2019 [Citation.] Defendant\u2019s burden is difficult to carry on direct appeal, as we have observed: \u2018 \u201cReviewing courts will reverse convictions [on direct appeal] on the ground of inadequate counsel only if the record on appeal affirmatively discloses that counsel had no rational tactical purpose for [his or her] act or omission.\u201d \u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Lucas, supra, </em>12 Cal.4th 415, 436-437.)</p>\n<p id=\"b215-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>The record reflects that defense counsel made a considered, tactical choice to withdraw the requested instruction. This choice was made following considerable discussion before the court and after defense counsel had the evening recess in which to consider the issue. As defense counsel obviously was aware, whether CALJIC No. 4.01 is beneficial to a defendant is open to doubt. Although the instruction was drafted to benefit defendants, the defendant in <em>People </em>v. <em>Kelly, supra, </em>1 Cal.4th 495, 538, argued (without success) that the giving of such an instruction was reversible error. The instruction aids the defendant by assuring the jury the defendant will not be released immediately upon a verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity, but a defendant reasonably could choose not to request the instruction for fear it might focus the attention of the jury upon the possibility of the defendant\u2019s release if he is restored to sanity. Defense counsel in the present case made a reasonable, tactical choice and was not ineffective in withdrawing his request for a jury instruction in the language of CALJIC No. 4.01.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">Defendant contends the prosecutor committed misconduct during his sanity phase argument by referring to Adolph Hitler, Charles Manson, and Richard Chase (the \u201cSacramento Vampire Killer\u201d). In attempting to make the point that the circumstance that a murder was committed for irrational reasons does not necessarily mean that the perpetrator is not guilty by reason of insanity, the prosecutor stated: \u201cYou see a homicide, especially a brutal homicide, and you say normal people don\u2019t do that. Normal people don\u2019t go out and hammer to death three . . . people, [f] And that is kind of a given. And if you look in the context of people who have problems who do these type killings, I don\u2019t care if you take a Hitler, a Manson, you take a Richard Chase, the Sacramento vampire killer, all these people have problems and they had goofy and bizarre reasons for doing what they did. Hitler didn\u2019t like Jews. He was obsessed with the Jewish race so he planned to exterminate them. Do you think Mr. Hitler had a problem, undoubtedly so. Do you think it is an obsession that he acted upon a bizarre brutal reason to go out and kill a bunch of people? Yes. Did he know what he was doing? You betcha. [f] Chase\u2014\u201d At that point, defendant objected, stating, \u201cthat doesn\u2019t fit this definition. It is a different test as to what would happen as to Mr. Chase.\u201d The court sustained the objection. The prosecutor made no further reference to Richard Chase, but continued the theme, without objection, with references to \u201cthese homicides in the paper. Woman kills her three children. This guy is in a tower, starts shooting down all these people in Texas, on and on and for reasons that you and I simply do not understand.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">Defendant\u2019s sole objection was to the reference to Richard Chase. That objection was sustained, and defendant did not ask that the jury be admonished to disregard the previous reference to Chase. Accordingly, defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>may not argue on appeal that the prosecutor\u2019s references to Hitler, Manson, and Chase constituted reversible error. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Bonin </em>(1988) 46 Cal.3d 659, 689 [250 Cal.Rptr. 687, 758 P.2d 1217]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Green, supra, </em>27 Cal.3d 1, 27.)</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">In any event, the prosecutor\u2019s references to notorious murderers did not constitute misconduct. It was proper for the prosecutor to use as examples notorious murderers who committed heinous crimes for irrational purposes but apparently were legally sane. The prosecutor did not suggest that the offenses charged against defendant were as heinous as those committed by Hitler, Manson, and Chase. (Cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Wein </em>(1958) 50 Cal.2d 383, 396-397 [326 P.2d 457].) \u201cIn general, prosecutors should refrain from comparing defendants to historic or fictional villains, especially where the comparisons are wholly inappropriate or unlinked to the evidence. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Bloom </em>(1989) 48 Cal.3d 1194, 1213 [259 Cal.Rptr. 669, 774 P.2d 698].) In the present case, it was proper for the prosecutor to use these well-known examples of irrational murders to illustrate his point regarding the limits of the defense of insanity.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">Defendant contends the following portion of the prosecutor\u2019s sanity phase argument constituted misconduct because it mischaracterized the testimony of psychiatrist Dr. Captane Thomson: \u201cFirst of all, you know this defendant is antisocial, and one of the paramount functions of being an antisocial or sociopath that this man is, he doesn\u2019t care about the rights of others. He is amoral and unremorseful for this acts. You heard Captane Thomson tell you about that. And that is part of this defendant. And I told you in opening statement that was part of his problem.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b216-7\">The prosecutor did not mischaracterize Dr. Thomson\u2019s testimony. On cross-examination, Dr. Thomson stated that defendant was \u201cantisocial\u201d or a \u201csociopath,\u201d and agreed that a characteristic of individuals with antisocial personality disorder or sociopathy is a lack of remorse. Dr. Thomson further agreed that defendant \u201cis capable of doing sadistic acts and not even caring for what happened to the people that he did them to . . . .\u201d Finally, Dr. Thomson acknowledged that when he spoke to defendant on March 8,1987, defendant \u201cexpressed to [Dr. Thomson] having no remorse for what he did to the victims . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b216-8\">Defendant\u2019s additional argument that the cumulative prejudice of the prosecutor\u2019s alleged misconduct during the guilt and sanity phases requires reversal of the judgment fails because, as discussed above, any prejudice arising from the sole instance of prosecutorial misconduct, which occurred during the guilt phase of the trial, was cured by the trial court\u2019s admonition to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>\n<em>Penalty Phase</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">Defendant argues that much of the prosecutor\u2019s argument during the penalty phase of the trial constituted misconduct, but he did not object at trial to the numerous portions of the prosecutor\u2019s argument he now claims constituted misconduct.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> As noted above, the general rule is that such a failure to object waives the issue and precludes the defendant from raising it on appeal. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Green, supra, </em>27 Cal.3d 1, 27.) Defendant argues that his lack of objection should be excused because a timely objection and admonition would not have cured the harm. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 34.) We disagree. Defendant argues that an objection and admonition would have been insufficient to cure the prejudice, because the instances of prosecutorial misconduct were \u201cso numerous, and the misconduct so pervasive, multifaceted and serious . . . .\u201d If defendant were correct that the disputed portions of the prosecutor\u2019s argument were improper, a timely objection to the first instance of such misconduct might well have prompted a favorable ruling and prevented repetition of such improper argument. \u201cThe reason for this rule [requiring a timely objection], of course, is that \u2018the trial court should be given an opportunity to correct the abuse and thus, if possible, prevent by suitable instructions the harmful effect upon the minds of the jury.\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 27.)</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">Defendant also argues that the requirement of a timely objection should not apply when \u201cthe prosecutor has committed misconduct which would result in a miscarriage of justice.\u201d We considered and rejected this contention in <em>People </em>v. <em>Green, supra, </em>27 Cal.3d 1, 28-34, and consistently have so ruled. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Cain </em>(1995) 10 Cal.4th 1, 48 [40 Cal.Rptr.2d 481, 892 P.2d 1224]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Carrera </em>(1989) 49 Cal.3d 291, 321 [261 Cal.Rptr. 348, <em>777 </em>P.2d 121].) Defendant presents no persuasive reason for reconsidering these holdings.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-7\">Defendant next argues that the court should have \u201cintervened even absent an objection by counsel.\u201d \u201c[A] trial court has no sua sponte duty to control <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>prosecutorial misconduct. . . <em>(People </em>v. <em>Carrera, supra, </em>49 Cal.3d 291, 321; <em>People </em>v. <em>Montiel, supra, </em>5 Cal.4th 877, 914.)</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">In the alternative, defendant asserts that defense counsel\u2019s failure to object deprived him of effective assistance of counsel. This claim fails because the record before us does not eliminate the possibility that counsel\u2019s decision not to object \u201cresulted from an informed tactical choice within the range of reasonable competence.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Pope </em>(1979) 23 Cal.3d 412, 425 [152 Cal.Rptr. 732, 590 P.2d 859, 2 A.L.R.4th 1].)</p>\n<p id=\"b218-7\">Even if defendant had preserved the issue of prosecutorial misconduct by interposing timely objections, his claims of misconduct lack merit. Defendant first contends the prosecutor \u201cmischaracterized the jury\u2019s sentencing task as being solely to make \u2018the punishment fit the crime\u2019 rather than being to weigh the evidence in mitigation against the evidence in aggravation.\u201d The record does not support this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-8\">Near the beginning of his argument, the prosecutor stated: \u201cThe question is what should the punishment be for Jeffrey Jones murdering Michael Corbett and Harry Dong. That is the question that we have to focus on. And that is the question that is very, very important for you jurors to keep in mind, what punishment fits these crimes, because that\u2019s what we are dealing with here.\u201d Subsequently, the prosecutor made several additional references to making the punishment fit the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-9\">The prosecutor\u2019s statements that the jury\u2019s task during the penalty phase deliberations was to determine \u201cwhat punishment fits these crimes,\u201d considered by themselves, were at worst ambiguous. Defendant urges us to construe these statements to mean that the jury should focus solely upon the circumstances of the offense to the exclusion of all other factors, but the prosecutor\u2019s statements also can be understood to refer in a more general manner <em>to </em>the crimes committed by this particular defendant, and thus to encompass the mitigating factors regarding \u201cthe defendant\u2019s character, background, history, mental condition and physical condition.\u201d (\u00a7 190.3.)</p>\n<p id=\"b218-10\">In any event, the prosecutor\u2019s argument, considered as a whole, clearly did not suggest that the jury should limit its consideration to the circumstances of the capital offenses. The prosecutor described the \u201ctest\u201d to be applied by the jury as \u201cthe process of how you go about weighing and balancing factors in aggravation or circumstances in aggravation, what makes it so heinous, so brutal, so bad, versus the factors in mitigation, anything the defense has offered to try and convince you that somehow the penalty for what he did to these people should be less than death. [*][] [I]n <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>order for the death penalty to be warranted after you have gone through this balancing process, the aggravating factors have to outweigh the mitigating factors so substantially that death is warranted.\u201d The prosecutor added: \u201cEverything you have heard from day one in the guilt phase, in the sanity phase, and the evidence and attempts to mitigate in the penalty phase. That is the balance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">The prosecutor then referred to a chart of the statutory factors listed in section 190.3<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> and observed that \u201cthe law very strictly and very severely limits the type [of] things that you are allowed to consider in aggravation. . . . [Factors] (a), (b) and (c) are the only things the law permits you as a jury when you are fixing this appropriate punishment to consider in aggravation. That is the first thing you will observe. [\u00b6] The second thing you will observe is the contrary is true with respect to the things that you can consider in mitigation, to say or to make you feel that Mr. Jones, for what you did, what you did to Harry Dong, what you did to Michael Corbett and knowing these other violent acts that you did, that somehow you should receive less than the death penalty. These factors, (d) through (k) are essentially the mitigational factors that the law says that you are allowed to consider. So it is wide open. [\u00b6] And I think you can tell from the bottom one, (k), it is anything the defense can give to you to try and convince you that for these crimes somehow the punishment ought to be something other than death. So it is wide open.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">The prosecutor next discussed each of the statutory factors listed in section 190.3, offering his opinion as to which applied to the present case. He told the jury it would have to consider the factors in mitigation relied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>upon by defendant regarding whether he committed the murders while \u201cunder the influence of extreme mental or emotional disturbance,\u201d \u201c[whether or not at the time of the offense the capacity of the defendant to appreciate the criminality of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of law was impaired as a result of mental disease or defect . . . and \u201c[a]ny other circumstance which extenuates the gravity of the crime even though it is not a legal excuse for the crime.\u201d (\u00a7 190.3, factors (d), (h), and (k).)</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">Contrary to defendant\u2019s assertion, the prosecutor did not urge the jury to ignore the mitigating evidence relied upon by defendant. Rather, the prosecutor forcefully and properly argued that the factors in mitigation relied upon by defendant were entitled to little Weight, and were substantially outweighed by the aggravating factors of the circumstances of the offenses and the evidence of other violent criminal activity. \u201cA prosecutor does not mischaracterize [mitigating] evidence by arguing it should not carry any extenuating weight when evaluated in a broader factual context. We have consistently declined to criticize advocacy of this nature.

There is nothing that you can grab a hold here and hold on to to say that he deserves my sympathy, that I have a right to give it to him and he deserves it to mitigate the punishment. It doesn\u2019t exist.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b220-7\">Defendant asserts that the prosecutor\u2019s argument that defendant was not entitled to the jury\u2019s sympathy \u201cwas tantamount to asserting that the jurors should disregard as <em>irrelevant </em>all of the mitigating evidence presented.\u201d (Italics in original.) As noted above, the prosecutor did not argue that evidence relied upon by defendant to elicit sympathy was irrelevant. The prosecutor properly argued that, based upon all of the evidence presented, defendant was not entitled to the jury\u2019s sympathy.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-8\">Defendant contends the prosecutor told the jury it had no right to consider a sentence other than death. That is not a fair reading of the prosecutor\u2019s comment. The prosecutor argued that sparing defendant the death penalty would be an act of leniency, and asked the jury: \u201cWould such a gift of leniency\u2014where does it come from? Is it even your right to give it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>in this case? Does it really fit what he did to these people, his conduct?\u201d Considered in context, the prosecutor\u2019s argument simply questioned whether the jury should impose a lenient sentence if the circumstances in aggravation outweighed those in mitigation. In the context of the court\u2019s instructions to the jury, the prosecutor\u2019s argument could not have misled the jury concerning the factors they properly were to consider in determining the appropriate penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">Defendant claims it was improper for the prosecutor to argue that the jury should not impose a life sentence based upon evidence that \u201cas a young kid, Mr. Jones was kind of okay.\u201d The prosecutor stated that directing the jury\u2019s attention to defendant\u2019s behavior as a child was \u201ca proper legal maneuver that is employed [by the defense] to shift you away from looking at the real question of fitting that appropriate punishment to the crime,\u201d and argued further that every murderer on death row \u201creally probably grew up as a kid, nice kid.\u201d As we held regarding a similar argument in <em>People </em>v. <em>Sims </em>(1993) 5 Cal.4th 405, 464 [20 Cal.Rptr.2d 537, 853 P.2d 992], this argument was proper because the prosecutor \u201cdid not imply that the jury should disregard the evidence of defendant\u2019s background, but rather that, in relation to the nature of the crimes committed, it had no mitigating effect.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">Defendant characterizes as misconduct the prosecutor\u2019s argument that not to impose the death penalty for the crimes committed by defendant \u201cwould make the death penalty meaningless.\u201d Although overstated, the import of this comment is that the present case is precisely the type in which the death penalty should be imposed. This is within the bounds of proper argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-7\">The prosecutor observed that death is a subject people \u201cdo not like to talk about\u201d and \u201cprobably have difficulty in dealing with and discussing.\u201d Even though it may be difficult for the jurors \u201cto face the concept of death,\u201d he continued, \u201c[y]ou have to face up to it individually as members of this jury and collectively in your verdict.\u201d The prosecutor argued that there is a \u201ctype of courage that you have to have in looking at this decision, the type [of] courage that maybe a soldier has on the eve of battle when he knows he\u2019s going to get involved. ... It is the type [of] courage you would have to have, perhaps if you are a terminal patient and you know you are looking at death.\u201d Defendant contends this argument was improper because it told the jury \u201cthat failing to impose a sentence of death would mean the jurors lacked \u2018courage.\u2019 \u201d This mischaracterizes the prosecutor\u2019s argument. It was proper for the prosecutor to argue that determining the appropriate punishment in a capital case is a difficult decision that requires courage.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-8\">Defendant asserts that it was improper for the prosecutor to state that the jury acted as \u201cthe conscience of the community,\u201d because it \u201cdiminished the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>jurors\u2019 sense of individual responsibility for the decision to be made.\u201d We disagree. One function of a jury is to represent the community. As the United States Supreme Court stated in <em>Witherspoon </em>v. <em>Illinois, supra, </em>391 U.S. 510, 519-520 [88 S.Ct. 1770, 1775], \u201ca jury that must choose between life imprisonment and capital punishment can do little more\u2014and must do nothing less\u2014than express the conscience of the community on the ultimate question of life or death.\u201d (Fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">Defendant contends the prosecutor committed misconduct by characterizing defendant\u2019s evidence of mental illness as \u201criddled with holes\u201d and \u201cethereal.\u201d The prosecutor stated: \u201cThe evidence is riddled with holes, just literally riddled with holes about his mental defect, if he had one, what it was, did he malinger it, if so, how much, did he have a defect at all, was he just antisocial, is he a sociopath. What really was his problem. The evidence is just, it is ethereal. It is nothing you can grab hold of.\u201d These were fair comments upon the evidence presented. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Clark </em>(1993) 5 Cal.4th 950, 1029-1030 [22 Cal.Rptr.2d 689, 857 P.2d 1099].)</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">Without citation to authority, defendant asserts the prosecutor mischaracterized the testimony of the many mental health professionals by arguing that defendant committed the murders because he was a sociopath, and assigns racial overtones to the prosecutor\u2019s statement that there is \u201ca black spot on the soul\u201d of defendant. The prosecutor argued: \u201cDid he do these killings just because he is antisocial? Or a sociopath? .... I submit to you that the evidence in this case . . . shows you that there is a dark, a black spot on the soul of Mr. Jones. He has that evil in him, and I don\u2019t think anybody here can dispute that.\u201d The prosecutor\u2019s argument that defendant is a sociopath was a reasonable comment upon the evidence, and there is no indication that the prosecutor\u2019s image of a black spot on defendant\u2019s soul was intended, or understood, as a racial slur.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-7\">Defendant asserts that the prosecutor misled the jury to believe that defendant had presented no mitigating evidence under section 190.3, factor (h), relating to whether defendant\u2019s capacity to appreciate the criminality of his conduct or conform his conduct to the requirements of the law was impaired by mental illness, and misled the jury concerning the proper application of that factor. The prosecutor stated: \u201cFirst of all, did he, was he so impaired that literally he didn\u2019t know that his crimes were criminal, that his conduct was criminal, he couldn\u2019t appreciate his criminality? We have virtually answered that in the sanity case. . . . And that is one of the reasons why [defense counsel] will have some difficulty with factor (h) in trying to tell you that it is a valid mitigating factor here.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b222-8\">Defendant alleges that it was incorrect to compare section 190.3, factor (h), to the test for sanity, because factor (h) does not state a \u201ctest\u201d but rather <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>identifies factors for the jury to consider. Even if we accepted defendant\u2019s premise, it would establish at most that the prosecutor misstated the law in his argument to the jury, and not that the prosecutor committed misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">\u201cIn general, a prosecutor commits misconduct by the use of deceptive or reprehensible methods to persuade either the court or the jury. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Price </em>(1991) 1 Cal.4th 324, 447 [3 Cal.Rptr.2d 106, 821 P.2d 610].) \u201c \u2018[A] prosecutor is not guilty of misconduct because in his argument of the law to the jury, he is wrong as to the law. Misconduct occurs only where an erroneous proposition of law was argued in bad faith [citation].\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Bonin, supra, </em>46 Cal.3d 659, 702.) Earlier in his argument, the prosecutor correctly told the jury they should consider whether section 190.3, factor (h), applied, accurately described factor (h) as \u201cwhether or not at the time [defendant] did these crimes his capacity to appreciate the criminality of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law was impaired,\u201d and stated that this was \u201cthe essence of what the defense is trying to tell you is their mitigational evidence.\u201d Whether or not the prosecutor later misstated the law in some respects, there is no evidence of bad faith and, hence, no evidence of misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">Defendant argues that the prosecutor improperly characterized defendant\u2019s mental illness as an aggravating factor, rather than a mitigating factor, by arguing that the jury should not feel sympathy for defendant because defendant, during his adult life, \u201cdropped out. He quit. He was a failure. He told people that. His actions speak for it. He wasn\u2019t going to work. He didn\u2019t work.\u201d Defendant reasons that this comment constituted misconduct because it was defendant\u2019s mental illness that caused him to be a failure. The prosecutor, however, relied upon a contrary theory that defendant chose not to contribute to society and exaggerated the symptoms of his mental illness to excuse his behavior. As noted above, \u201c[a] prosecutor does not mischaracterize [mitigating] evidence by arguing it should not carry any extenuating weight when evaluated in a broader factual context. We have consistently declined to criticize advocacy of this nature. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Cox, supra, </em>53 Cal.3d 618, 683.)</p>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">Defendant argues that the prosecutor committed misconduct by telling the jury that they could consider sympathy under factor (k) of section 190.3, \u201c[b]ut that [such] sympathy or pity or passion has to be to this defendant, not his mom, not his brothers, not the victims in the case, not to their families.\u201d The prosecutor\u2019s argument accurately anticipated the decisions in <em>Booth </em>v. <em>Maryland </em>(1987) 482 U.S. 496 [107 S.Ct. 2529, 96 L.Ed.2d 440] and <em>South Carolina </em>v. <em>Gathers </em>(1989) 490 U.S. 805 [109 S.Ct. 2207, 104 L.Ed.2d 876], which held that the jury in capital sentencing proceedings <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>is not permitted to consider sympathy for the victim or the victim\u2019s family. The United States Supreme Court, however, later reconsidered these holdings and, in <em>Payne </em>v. <em>Tennessee </em>(1991) 501 U.S. 808 [111 S.Ct. 2597, 115 L.Ed.2d 720], held that the jury could consider evidence of the characteristics of the victim and the impact of the crime on the victim\u2019s family. Neither the high court nor this court yet has decided whether the jury may consider evidence of the impact a judgment of death would have upon the defendant\u2019s family. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Beeler </em>(1995) 9 Cal.4th 953, 991 [39 Cal.Rptr.2d 607, 891 P.2d 153]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Bacigalupo, supra, </em>1 Cal.4th 103, 143.) Whether or not the prosecutor\u2019s argument accurately described the present state of the law on this point, it certainly did not constitute misconduct. As is true of defendant\u2019s additional contentions that the prosecutor misstated the law regarding the jury\u2019s consideration of sympathy under factor (k), the circumstance that the prosecutor misstated the law during argument does not, standing alone, establish misconduct. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Bonin, supra, </em>46 Cal.3d 659, 703.)</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">Defendant asserts the prosecutor urged the jury to consider the testimony of defendant\u2019s mother as evidence in aggravation, rather than mitigation. Defendant draws this conclusion from the prosecutor\u2019s observation during argument that some jurors had cried during the testimony of defendant\u2019s mother, and the prosecutor\u2019s statement that he had \u201cthe very distinct and strong feeling that those tears were for Mrs. Jones and the pain and the grief and the sorrow that this defendant caused by his acts. They weren\u2019t for Jeffrey Jones.\u201d The prosecutor continued that he had \u201cthe strong and distinct feeling, almost certain feeling that a portion of the tears that [he] saw during that testimony may well have been for the victims in this case, their families, their hopes, their dreams, their survivors. They were not for Jeffrey Jones.\u201d This was proper argument. It was proper for the prosecutor to suggest that the emotions displayed by some of the jurors were caused by the effect of defendant\u2019s crime, rather than by pity for defendant and his family.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">Without citation to authority, defendant contends the prosecutor committed misconduct by arguing to the jury that murder victims Corbett and Dong felt terror and pain when they were attacked. Defendant asserts that the record establishes that both victims felt no terror or pain because they immediately were rendered unconscious by defendant\u2019s first blow. The record does not support defendant\u2019s assertion. Evidence was introduced that Corbett screamed upon being attacked, which supports the inference that he experienced pain and terror before being rendered unconscious. Dong suffered multiple wounds, including wounds to his face, a circumstance supporting the inference that he tinned to face his attacker before being rendered unconscious. \u201cWe repeatedly have stated that \u2018[t]he prosecution has broad <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>discretion to state its views as to what the evidence shows and what inferences may be drawn therefrom.\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Sims, supra, 5 </em>Cal.4th 405, 463.) The prosecutor\u2019s argument that these victims experienced pain and terror was based upon reasonable inferences from the record and was proper. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Garceau </em>(1993) 6 Cal.4th 140, 206 [24 Cal.Rptr.2d 664, 862 P.2d 664].)</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">Defendant contends it was misconduct for the prosecutor to argue that the jury should not conclude that life in prison would be a suitable punishment for the reason that the conditions in prison are \u201cvery bad.\u201d Because no evidence was introduced concerning conditions in prison, the prosecutor was correct that it would be improper for the jury to base its decision upon speculation concerning prison conditions. Also, the conditions of confinement during a life sentence do not constitute mitigating circumstances. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Zapien </em>(1993) 4 Cal.4th 929, 989 [17 Cal.Rptr.2d 122, 846 P.2d 704]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Daniels </em>(1991) 52 Cal.3d 815, 877 [277 Cal.Rptr. 122, 802 P.2d 906].) The prosecutor\u2019s argument was not improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">\n<em>Jury Instructions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">Defendant contends the trial court committed reversible error by refusing defendant\u2019s request that it instruct the jury as follows: \u201cA sentence of life imprisonment without possibility of parole means that Defendant Jeffrey Gerard Jones will remain in state prison for the rest of his life and will not be paroled at any time. A sentence of death means that Defendant Jeffrey Gerard Jones will be executed.\u201d The trial court properly refused the requested instruction, because it is inaccurate. \u201cThe Governor may ameliorate any sentence by use of the commutation or pardon power, and it is thus \u2018 \u201cincorrect to tell the jury the penalty of . . . life without possibility of parole will inexorably be carried out\u201d [citation].\u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Arias </em>(1996) 13 Cal.4th 92, 172 [51 Cal.Rptr.2d 770, 913 P.2d 980].)</p>\n<p id=\"b225-8\">Relying upon the decision in <em>Simmons </em>v. <em>South Carolina </em>(1994) 512 U.S. 154 [114 S.Ct. 2187, 129 L.Ed.2d 133], defendant claims the trial court was required, upon request, to inform the jury that, if sentenced to life in prison, he would be ineligible for parole. We considered and rejected this precise issue in <em>People </em>v. <em>Arias, supra, </em>13 Cal.4th 92, observing that, in <em>Simmons, </em>the jury was told only that the defendant \u201cwould suffer \u2018life imprisonment,\u2019 \u201d \u201cand the court barred all reference during the trial to the defendant\u2019s ineligibility for parole.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 172.) \u201cThe due process deficiencies in the <em>Simmons </em>trial do not exist in a California capital penalty trial.

Defendant first points to the court\u2019s statement that because defendant was aware of the wrongfulness of his conduct, despite his mental illness, \u201cthe Court finds this is not a factor in mitigation but rather a factor in aggravation.\u201d \u201cAlthough the absence of a mitigating factor is not itself an aggravating factor, the court may properly consider in aggravation the \u2018objective circumstances of the killing.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Cooper </em>(1991) 53 Cal.3d 771, 848 [281 Cal.Rptr. 90, 809 P.2d 865].) It was proper for the court to consider in aggravation the circumstances that defendant committed three brutal, unprovoked attacks on unarmed and unsuspecting victims, killing two of them, with full awareness of the wrongfulness of his conduct. As we noted in rejecting a similar contention in <em>People </em>v. <em>Clair </em>(1992) 2 Cal.4th 629, 690 [7 Cal.Rptr.2d 564, 828 P.2d 705]: \u201cGiven a reasonable reading, the quoted words reveal nothing more than a determination\u2014which was altogether sound\u2014that the circumstances of the crime, including defendant\u2019s evident mental capacity, were aggravating.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b228-8\">To the extent that the court erred in considering as a factor in aggravation the absence of evidence of impairment of defendant\u2019s ability to appreciate the criminality of his conduct, such error was not prejudicial. The trial court carefully considered each of the statutory factors and concluded \u201cthat the aggravating circumstances <em>far </em>outweigh any of the mitigating circumstances.\u201d (Italics added.) \u201cReviewing the court\u2019s full statement, we are satisfied that any misunderstanding \u2018had no impact on the court\u2019s decision to deny the motion.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Cooper, supra, </em>53 Cal.3d 771, 848.)</p>\n<p id=\"b228-9\">The foregoing reasoning leads us to reject as well defendant\u2019s contention that the trial court erred in considering as a factor in aggravation the circumstance that defendant committed the charged offenses \u201cpersonally and alone.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b228-10\">Defendant contends that the trial court applied the wrong standard in determining that the offense was not committed while defendant was under the influence of extreme mental or emotional disturbance. The trial court stated: \u201cThere is credible evidence that the offense was committed while the defendant was under the influence of a mental and emotional disturbance, but the Court is not prepared to find that it was of such extreme or emotional disturbance to justify his acts. [\u00b6] There is further evidence that clearly establishes the defendant knew what he was doing. . . . [\u00b6] But I am <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>finding that, and am considering the fact that there was evidence of some mental and emotional disturbance. The Court is considering that as a mitigating factor, although it is a slight mitigating factor.\u201d The court later observed, in discussing under section 190.3, factor (h), whether defendant\u2019s capacity to appreciate the criminality of his conduct was impaired, that defendant\u2019s \u201cmental disease or defect was not of such a magnitude that it outweighed his ability to distinguish right from wrong and to appreciate that what he was doing was in fact wrong.\u201d According to defendant, these comments \u201creflect that [the trial court] erroneously believed that in order to constitute mitigation, [defendant]\u2019s mental disturbance must have been of a nature to have reduced his <em>legal </em>culpability for his crimes.\u201d (Italics in original.) This misconstrues the court\u2019s remarks. The court clearly stated that it was considering as a mitigating factor the evidence of defendant\u2019s mental and emotional disturbance. Certainly, the circumstance that, despite his mental impairment, defendant \u201cknew what he was doing\u201d and could distinguish right from wrong properly affects the weight of this mitigating factor. In light of the other evidence, discussed above, of defendant\u2019s malingering and appreciation of the nature of his crimes, the trial court was justified in concluding that the weight of the evidence related to this factor was \u201cslight.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">The trial court considered the brutal and savage manner in which the offenses were committed as an aggravating factor. In a rather convoluted argument, defendant contends that, \u201cbecause the manner in which the crimes were committed\u201d demonstrated his mental illness, the trial court\u2019s consideration of the circumstances of the crimes as an aggravating factor constitutes an improper consideration of defendant\u2019s mental illness as an aggravating factor. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">As we have stated repeatedly, the trial court\u2019s conclusion that defendant understood the wrongfulness of his conduct is supported by substantial evidence. Accordingly, the trial court did not err in considering as a factor in aggravation the circumstance that defendant purposefully committed three brutal and savage murders and one attempted murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">Defendant further asserts the motion for modification of the verdict should have been granted because a sentence of death constitutes disproportionate punishment in light of defendant\u2019s mental illness. We disagree. As defendant recognizes, we have held that \u201c[comparative sentence review, statistical or otherwise, is not required by the federal Constitution.

As noted above, the record reflects substantial evidence supporting the opposite conclusion that defendant\u2019s crimes were not the result of his mental illness, but were planned by defendant and knowingly committed in a brutal and savage manner. The trial court did not err in concluding that, despite the evidence of defendant\u2019s mental illness, the death penalty was not disproportionate to defendant\u2019s personal culpability.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">\n<em>Jury Misconduct</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">Defendant contends the trial court abused its discretion in denying his request, immediately prior to sentencing, to call a juror to the witness stand to examine her concerning a possible instance of juror misconduct. As explained below, the trial court did not abuse its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-7\">At the time set for sentencing, the following colloquy occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-8\">\u201c[Defense counsel]: Before proceeding with judgment and sentencing, the defense requests I be allowed to call one witness to examine one issue as it related to jury deliberations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-9\">\u201cThe Court: As an offer of proof, what area are you intending to go into?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-10\">\u201c[Defense counsel]: I received some information that one juror had done some research in the medical area as it related to some of the testimony that came into the court, and many of the jurors on this case really didn\u2019t want to interview with the defense. . . . [\u00b6 What we have done is to subpoena [Juror Chamness] so that we can examine her to ask her what did she look up and what particular information was imparted from what she learned and discussed with the other jurors . . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b230-11\">When the court asked defense counsel for the basis of his belief, counsel made a brief reference to a discussion his investigator had had with another juror, and then stated that when Juror Chamness \u201creceived the subpoena she telephoned my office and indicated she was displeased with receiving the subpoena and that she did look up something because she works at a medical facility and she considered that part of her job. And she believed that her obligation as a juror is to discuss the case and deliberate. And so that is all the information I have at the present time.\u201d The trial court denied the request to have the juror testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-12\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Hedgecock </em>(1990) 51 Cal.3d 395, 419 [272 Cal.Rptr. 803, 795 P.2d 1260], we held \u201cthat it is within the discretion of a trial court to conduct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>an evidentiary hearing to determine the truth or falsity of allegations of jury misconduct, and to permit the parties to call jurors to testify at such a hearing. This does not mean, however, that a trial court must hold an evidentiary hearing in every instance of alleged jury misconduct. The hearing should not be used as a \u2018fishing expedition\u2019 to search for possible misconduct, but should be held only when the defense has come forward with evidence demonstrating a strong possibility that prejudicial misconduct has occurred. Even upon such a showing, an evidentiary hearing will generally be unnecessary unless the parties\u2019 evidence presents a material conflict that can only be resolved at such a hearing.\u201d (Fn. omitted.) It is clear, under this standard, that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying defendant\u2019s request to call the juror as a witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">Initially, it must be noted that the decision in <em>People </em>v. <em>Hedgecock, supra, </em>51 Cal.3d 395, involved a request for an evidentiary hearing in connection with a motion for new trial based upon allegations of juror misconduct. In the present case, defendant did not bring a motion for new trial. He simply asked for permission to call a juror to the witness stand in order to determine whether she had engaged in misconduct. No authority of which we are aware condones such a practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">The request would have fared no better, moreover, had it been made in connection with a motion for new trial. The trial court, in denying the request, properly characterized it as \u201ca fishing expedition.\u201d Defense counsel stated only that his investigator had received some undescribed information from another juror and that Juror Chamness had telephoned his office and indicated \u201cthat she did look up something.\u201d The offer of proof did not reveal what information Juror Chamness received, or whether she communicated this information to other jurors. Defense counsel candidly acknowledged that he wished to examine the juror to determine whether misconduct had occurred. Defense counsel did not present \u201cevidence demonstrating a strong possibility that prejudicial misconduct has occurred.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Hedgecock, supra, </em>51 Cal.3d 395, 419.) Even if defendant had satisfied this threshold requirement, an evidentiary hearing would not have been necessary, because the offer of proof did not present \u201ca material conflict that [could] only be resolved at such a hearing.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">Defendant\u2019s claim also fails because defendant has not demonstrated that he was prejudiced by the trial court\u2019s denial of his request to examine the juror. The record before us provides no basis upon which we can determine whether, had she been called as a witness, the juror would have provided evidence of juror misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>\n<em>Validity of Death Penalty Statute</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">Defendant contends the death penalty statute is unconstitutional because it fails adequately to narrow the class of death eligible defendants. We previously have considered and rejected this precise contention. <em>People </em>v. <em>Ray </em>(1996) 13 Cal.4th 313, 356-357 [52 Cal.Rptr.2d 296, 914 P.2d 846]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Crittenden </em>(1994) 9 Cal.4th 83, 154-155 [36 Cal.Rptr.2d 474, 885 P.2d 887].)</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">Defendant also contends that the death penalty statute is unconstitutional because it grants the prosecutor unbridled discretion whether to allege special circumstances and whether to seek the death penalty.

We previously have considered and rejected these contentions. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Arias, supra, </em>13 Cal.4th 92, 187-188, 190; <em>People </em>v. <em>Crittenden, supra, 9 </em>Cal.4th 83, 152-153.)</p>\n<p id=\"b232-8\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b232-9\">The judgment is affirmed in its entirety.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-10\">Baxter, J., and Chin, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b170-10\"> All further statutory references are to the Penal Code unless otherwise indicated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b170-11\"> Section 1368 states, in pertinent part: \u201c(a) If, during the pendency of an action and prior to judgment, a doubt arises in the mind of the judge as to the mental competence of the defendant, he shall state that doubt in the record and inquire of the attorney for the defendant whether, in the opinion of the attorney, the defendant is mentally competent. ...

As Justice Werdegar notes in her concurring and dissenting opinion, the prosecutor\u2019s purpose in eliciting the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>fact that defendant had invoked his right to remain silent on the day of his arrest was not simply to negate the use of defendant\u2019s silence as evidence of insanity, but to use it affirmatively as evidence of defendant\u2019s sanity by showing that his silences were calculated and not the product of mental illness. The prosecutor said so when arguing for the admission of defendant\u2019s invocation of his rights: \u201c[T]here is evidence from day one where he was lucid, where he tells these people, \u2018My lawyer told me not to talk to you. I\u2019m not going to talk to you.\u2019 \u201d In questioning Dr. Mertz, the prosecutor preceded the question concerning defendant\u2019s invocation of his rights with more general questions concerning the possibility that defendant\u2019s silences were part of a calculated attempt to malinger, thus presenting defendant\u2019s invocation of his rights as another incident of calculated silence showing defendant\u2019s lucidity. He then went on to question Dr. Mertz about other specific acts of potential malingering (not involving the invocation of defendant\u2019s rights). Likewise, his questioning of Dr. Thomson regarding defendant\u2019s invocation of his right to remain silent occurred in the context of an inquiry into defendant\u2019s malingering. This affirmative use of defendant\u2019s invocation of his right to remain silent as evidence of his \u201clucidity\u201d is prohibited by <em>Wainwright </em>v. <em>Greenfield </em>(1986) 474 U.S. 284 [106 S.Ct. 634, 88 L.Ed.2d 623], as Justice Werdegar explains.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">Moreover, even if the prosecutor\u2019s use of the evidence here is characterized not as affirmative proof of lucidity but only as a negation of the inference that his silence was evidence of insanity, the plurality\u2019s classification of the evidence as rebuttal seems questionable. There was only one occasion when defendant invoked his right to remain silent, the day of his arrest (Jan. 23, 1985). It does not appear that any of defendant\u2019s witnesses relied particularly on his silence on that day for their conclusion that he was mentally ill. Rather, they relied on later periods of much more acutely disturbed behavior; for example, episodes in March and July 1985 when defendant was not only uncommunicative but hallucinatory and engaging in bizarre acts. I conclude, however, that the error was harmless for the reasons stated by Justice Werdegar.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">The second issue on which I disagree with the plurality opinion is its conclusion that the trial court did not err in considering defendant\u2019s mental disease or defect as a factor in aggravation under factor (h) of Penal Code section 190.3. It is settled that factor (h), which asks whether \u201cthe capacity of the defendant to appreciate the criminality of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of law was impaired as a result of mental disease or defect\u201d <em>(ibid.), </em>can only be a factor in mitigation and not an aggravating factor. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Hamilton </em>(1989) 48 Cal.3d 1142, 1184 [259 Cal.Rptr. 701, 774 P.2d 730].) Here, the trial court stated to the contrary, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>the specific context of addressing factor (h), that \u201cthe court finds this is not a factor in mitigation but rather a factor in aggravation.\u201d Nonetheless, unlike Justice Werdegar, I conclude that this error was harmless as well. The clear import of the trial court\u2019s remarks was that defendant\u2019s appreciation of the wrongfulness of his conduct was not clouded by his mental illness, and that it was this appreciation of wrongfulness by defendant that the trial court considered an aggravating factor. The trial court could properly consider this fact to be aggravating, albeit under factor (a) of Penal Code section 190.3 as one of the circumstances of the crime, rather than under factor (h). Its misclassification was not prejudicial. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Howard </em>(1992) 1 Cal.4th 1132, 1194-1195 [5 Cal.Rptr.2d 268, 824 P.2d 1315].)</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">In all other respects, I concur in the plurality opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b234-6\">WERDEGAR, J., Concurring and Dissenting.</author>\n<p id=\"AI\">I concur in the plurality\u2019s affirmance of the judgment of guilt and most of its reasoning. I write separately concerning the sanity phase of trial only to address defendant\u2019s claim of <em>Doyle-Greenfield </em>error (see <em>Doyle </em>v. <em>Ohio </em>(1976) 426 U.S. 610 [96 S.Ct. 2240, 49 L.Ed.2d 91] <em>(Doyle); Wainwright </em>v. <em>Greenfield </em>(1986) 474 U.S. 284 [106 S.Ct. 634, 88 L.Ed.2d 623] <em>(Greenfield)), </em>which I believe the plurality incorrectly rejects, although I conclude the error is harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>(Chapman </em>v. <em>California </em>(1967) 386 U.S. 18 [87 S.Ct. 824, 17 L.Ed.2d 705, 10 A.L.R.3d 974].)</p>\n<p id=\"b234-7\">I respectfully dissent, however, from the plurality\u2019s affirmance of the death sentence, because I conclude the trial court committed significant error in ruling on the automatic application to modify the verdict. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 190.4, subd. (e); further undesignated statutory citations are to this code.) In my view, remand is necessary to permit the trial court to rule on the application anew, having a correct understanding of the statutory aggravating and mitigating factors (\u00a7 190.3).</p>\n<p id=\"b234-8\">\n<em>Doyle-Greenfield</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b234-9\">Defendant argues the prosecutor, over defense objection, violated the principles articulated in <em>Doyle, supra, </em>426 U.S. 610, and <em>Greenfield, supra, </em>474 U.S. 284, by cross-examining defense witnesses to elicit testimony that, on the day after his arrest, defendant told a jail social worker, \u201cI am not going to talk to you. My lawyers told me not to talk to you and I\u2019m not going to answer any of your questions.\u201d The evident purpose of this line of cross-examination was to show that defendant\u2019s postarrest uncommunicativeness, which was one of numerous behaviors the defense adduced in support of the diagnosis of schizophrenia, was voluntary and reflected not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>insanity, but conscious malingering. The plurality concludes the evidence was properly elicited to rebut defendant\u2019s claim his illness rendered him incapable of communicating, reasoning that, because defendant had introduced evidence of his uncommunicativeness to prove he suffered from a mental illness, the prosecution was entitled to present evidence suggesting a different explanation for defendant\u2019s silence. The plurality suggests defendant\u2019s statement stands on the same constitutional footing as would evidence that his uncommunicativeness stemmed from laryngitis or a vow of silence. I disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\"><em>Doyle, supra, </em>426 U.S. 610, established that due process forbids the use of a defendant\u2019s postarrest silence to impeach an exculpatory defense proffered at trial, inasmuch as the <em>Miranda </em>warnings required to be administered after arrest (see <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona </em>(1966) 384 U.S. 436, 467-473 [86 S.Ct. 1602, 1624-1627, 16 L.Ed.2d 694, 10 A.L.R.3d 974]) carry an implicit assurance that silence will not be used against the defendant and render such silence \u201cinsolubly ambiguous\u201d <em>(Doyle, supra, </em>426 U.S. at p. 617 [96 S.Ct. at p. 2244]). <em>Greenfield, supra, </em>474 U.S. 284, applied <em>Doyle </em>to a case, like this one, in which the prosecution employed defendant\u2019s invocation of the right to silence to refute his defense of insanity.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">In the present case, defendant\u2019s statement (\u201cMy lawyers told me not to talk to you and I\u2019m not going to answer any of your questions.\u201d) is not ambiguous. It is, rather, a clear expression of reliance on advice of counsel and an implicit invocation of the privilege against self-incrimination. As such, pursuant to the rule in <em>Greenfield, </em>due process forbids its use to refute defendant\u2019s claim of insanity. That the record before us does not establish that <em>the police </em>informed defendant of his rights has no analytical significance. Nothing in <em>Fletcher </em>v. <em>Weir </em>(1982) 455 U.S. 603 [102 S.Ct. 1309, 71 L.Ed.2d 490], on which the People rely, suggests that the identity of the person who provides a defendant with <em>Miranda </em>warnings should be decisive of admissibility where it is clear the defendant remains silent in reliance on his <em>Miranda </em>rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-7\">Unlike the plurality, I find this case distinguishable from <em>United States </em>v. <em>Robinson </em>(1988) 485 U.S. 25 [108 S.Ct. 864, 99 L.Ed.2d 23] <em>(Robinson). </em>In that case, the high court rejected a claim of <em>Griffin </em>error (see <em>Griffin </em>v. <em>California </em>(1965) 380 U.S. 609, 614 [85 S.Ct. 1229, 1232-1233, 14 L.Ed.2d 106] [violation of Fifth Amendment for the prosecutor to argue or the trial court to instruct the jury that the defendant\u2019s failure to testify is evidence of his guilt]) based on the prosecutor\u2019s comment, in closing argument, that the defendant, who did not testify, \u201c \u2018could have taken the stand and explained it to you, anything he wanted to. The United States of America has given him, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>throughout, the opportunity to explain.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Robinson, supra, </em>485 U.S. at p. 28 [108 S.Ct. at p. 867].) The court reasoned the comment was a fair response to defense counsel\u2019s argument that the government had unfairly denied defendant the opportunity to explain his actions. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 31 [108 S.Ct. at p. 868].) Similarly, <em>in People </em>v. <em>Austin </em>(1994) 23 Cal.App.4th 1596, 1611-1612 [28 Cal.Rptr.2d 885] <em>(Austin), </em>the Court of Appeal recognized the prosecution\u2019s right to elicit evidence of the defendant\u2019s post <em>-Miranda </em>silence as a fair response to the defense\u2019s implication that the police had not afforded defendant the opportunity to make a full statement. <em>Robinson </em>and <em>Austin </em>make clear a defendant may not assert the privilege against self-incrimination to bar the prosecution from correcting an unfair implication that the state has thwarted him from providing an explanation of his incriminating conduct. Those cases do not, however, hold that evidence of a defendant\u2019s invocation of the right to remain silent is admissible whenever it might be useful to the prosecution\u2019s case. Such a conclusion obviously would, in effect, abrogate <em>Doyle </em>and <em>Greenfield.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">As in <em>Greenfield, </em>here the prosecutor elicited testimony concerning defendant\u2019s invocation of his rights in order to show that, notwithstanding evidence of his severe mental illness, defendant was malingering. Finding the testimony \u201chighly relevant,\u201d the plurality simply glosses over its context.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In so doing, the plurality errs.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">I would not, however, find the error in this case requires reversal. Because the jury heard considerable other evidence from which it could conclude defendant was malingering, I see no reasonable possibility the brief reference to defendant\u2019s invocation of his rights influenced the sanity verdict. Dr. Mertz, the jail psychiatrist, testified that correctional officers\u2019 notes indicated defendant behaved more normally when psychiatric staff were not present. Other psychiatric experts acknowledged they had diagnosed defendant as having antisocial personality disorder evidently predating his psychosis, and the testimony of various witnesses suggested defendant rarely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>complained of auditory command hallucinations until after criminal charges were instituted against him. The jury learned that Dr. Lamb, who evaluated defendant for disability benefits during February 1983, concluded defendant was malingering. Dr. Graham, who saw defendant in November 1983, likewise testified he suspected defendant of malingering in an attempt to obtain disability income because defendant lied and was evasive. In light of all the evidence, reversal of the sanity judgment is therefore unwarranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">\n<em>Automatic Application to Modify Verdict</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">The trial court\u2019s remarks in the course of its ruling on the automatic application to modify the verdict (\u00a7 190.4, subd. (e)) reveal its apparent misunderstanding of several of the statutory sentencing factors, most significantly section 190.3, factor (h) (whether or not at the time of the offense the capacity of the defendant to appreciate the criminality of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of law was impaired as a result of mental disease or defect). Because virtually defendant\u2019s only hope of avoiding a death sentence was to try to show his mental illness was so severe the ultimate penalty was unjustified, I cannot confidently conclude \u201cthat any misunderstanding \u2018had no impact on the court\u2019s decision to deny the motion\u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Cooper </em>(1991) 53 Cal.3d 771, 848 [281 Cal.Rptr. 90, 809 P.2d 865]). Under our duty to make an independent review of the ruling <em>(People </em>v. <em>Ashmus </em>(1991) 54 Cal.3d 932, 1006-1007 [2 Cal.Rptr.2d 112, 820 P.2d 214]), I would vacate the death sentence and remand for a new hearing on the application.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-7\">With respect to section 190.3, factor (d), whether or not the offense was committed while the defendant was under the influence of extreme mental or emotional disturbance, the trial court had this to say: \u201cThere is credible evidence that the offense was committed while the defendant was under the influence of a mental and emotional disturbance, but the Court is not prepared to find that it was <em>of such extreme or emotional [sic\\ disturbance to justify his acts. </em>[\u00b6] There is further evidence that clearly establishes the defendant knew what he was doing and that the murders were in fact\u2014and that he was wrong when he committed the murders.\u201d The court gratuitously added defendant would not have met the American Law Institute standard for a finding of legal insanity, if that standard had applied. The court concluded: \u201cBut I am finding that, and am considering the fact that there was evidence of some mental and emotional disturbance. The Court is considering that as a mitigating factor, although it is a slight mitigating factor.\u201d (Italics added.) Although the court thus ultimately accorded some \u201cslight\u201d mitigating weight to factor (d), its allusion to the American Law Institute standard and its comment that defendant\u2019s mental or emotional disturbance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>did not \u201cjustify\u201d the crimes and that defendant knew he was wrong when he committed them betray a tendency to consider the mitigating evidence of defendant\u2019s mental and emotional disturbance in terms appropriate to a sanity determination, but off the mark in the sentencing process.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">More disturbing in its importation of the standard for sanity determination into the process of capital sentence review was the court\u2019s discussion of section 190.3, factor (h), which, as noted above, focuses on whether or not, at the time of the offense, the capacity of the defendant to appreciate the criminality of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of law was impaired as a result of mental disease or defect, or the effects of intoxication. The trial court stated: \u201cHere the court finds there is credible evidence to show that the defendant did in fact appreciate the criminality of his conduct, even though he suffered from a mental disturbance. The defendant, following his brutal attack on Michael Corbett, when fleeing the murder scene, conveyed by his words and acts his appreciation of the wrongfulness of his acts. <em>His mental disease or defect was not of such a magnitude that it outweighed his ability to distinguish right from wrong and to appreciate that what he was doing was in fact wrong. Thus, the Court finds this is not a factor in mitigation but rather a factor in aggravation.\u201d </em>(Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">The court erred in focusing on the question whether defendant\u2019s mental illness \u201coutweighed\u201d his ability to distinguish right from wrong. That question may be relevant to the sanity phase, but it is not the salient inquiry in the sentencing phase. Rather, the sentencer must consider whether defendant\u2019s mental illness <em>impaired </em>his ability to appreciate the criminality of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law. An impairment is simply a diminution or lessening; thus, section 190.3, factor (h) directs the sentencer to consider in mitigation any lessening, due to mental disease or defect, of the defendant\u2019s capacity to appreciate the criminality of his acts or to conform his conduct to legal requirements. Obviously, evidence of mental illness falling short of legal insanity must be considered in mitigation if it had such an effect on the defendant\u2019s capacities, for factor (h) otherwise would be nugatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-7\">It is no criticism of the jury\u2019s verdicts to say the psychiatric evidence in this case clearly showed defendant\u2019s mental illness must have impaired to <em>some </em>extent his abilities within the contemplation of section 190.3, factor (h). Mental health expert witnesses in virtual unanimity diagnosed defendant as psychotic. Physicians (recall that most of the offenses took place at the University of California at Davis Medical Center) evidently figured prominently in defendant\u2019s delusions of having had a drill bit or other metallic object implanted in his ear. There was abundant evidence showing how <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>poorly defendant functioned both before and after the offenses, and the record reflects that defendant required and tolerated massive doses of neuroleptics. In my view, the trial court erred in failing to accord <em>some </em>mitigating weight to this factor.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">Compounding its evident misunderstanding, the court further erred in treating section 190.3, factor (h), which can only mitigate, as aggravating. Had the prosecutor rather than the court uttered this comment, we would have no trouble labeling it <em>Davenport </em>error. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Davenport </em>(1985) 41 Cal.3d 247 [221 Cal.Rptr. 794, 710 P.2d 861].) The court repeated the error in its discussion of section 190.3, factor (j), whether or not the defendant was an accomplice and his participation was relatively minor. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Hamilton </em>(1989) 48 Cal.3d 1142, 1184 [259 Cal.Rptr. 701, 774 P.2d 730] [factor (j) as mitigating]; but see <em>People </em>v. <em>Proctor </em>(1992) 4 Cal.4th 499, 553 [15 Cal.Rptr.2d 340, 842 P.2d 1100].)</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">Although in ruling on a verdict modification motion a trial judge must make an \u201cindependent\u201d determination whether imposition of the death penalty upon the defendant is proper, independence in this context refers to according the evidence the weight the judge himself or herself believes it deserves, in light of the applicable law (which the jury, having been correctly instructed, presumably followed). (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Clair </em>(1992) 2 Cal.4th 629, 689 [7 Cal.Rptr.2d 564, 828 P.2d 705].) To the extent this trial court, in deciding the motion, was applying rules of law different from those with which the jury had been instructed, its method contravened section 190.4, subdivision (e). The court\u2019s remarks concerning section 190.3, factor (h) indicate it did indeed apply a standard different from that given the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-7\">The plurality concludes any misunderstanding on the trial court\u2019s part had no impact on its decision to deny the motion, because it stated that \u201cthe aggravating circumstances far outweigh any of the mitigating circumstances.\u201d But because the trial court erroneously believed the aggravating circumstances included defendant\u2019s mental illness, its statement does not inspire confidence in the ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-8\">I would vacate the judgment and remand for a new hearing on the automatic motion under section 190.4, subdivision (e), so that the trial court can correctly apply the statutory sentencing factors. I express no view as to the proper outcome of such a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-9\">Brown, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b236-7\"> To the extent the plurality (plur. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 174) reads <em>Greenfield </em>as only precluding the use of evidence of the accused\u2019s postarrest silence to show he possessed the mental acuity to understand his constitutional rights, the plurality is mistaken; <em>Greenfield </em>cannot reasonably be read so narrowly. To the extent the plurality is suggesting the prosecution in this case did not adduce the evidence of defendant\u2019s statement to show that, contrary to his claim of insanity, he possessed mental acuity, it is likewise mistaken. The record reflects that such was indeed the prosecutor\u2019s intent in eliciting the testimony. At a sidebar conference at which this issue was argued, the prosecutor stated: \u201cCome on. You guys put on nurse Rumsey day after day on how she knew [defendant], supposedly knew [defendant], has testified six or seven months [defendant] doesn\u2019t say a word to the psychiatric staff, and, you know, <em>there is evidence from day one where he was lucid, </em>where he tells these people, \u2018My lawyer told me not to talk to you. I\u2019m not going to talk to you.\u201d (Italics added.) Plainly, the prosecutor\u2019s aim went beyond merely establishing that a reason other than mental illness accounted for defendant\u2019s silence; rather, he sought to refute the evidence that defendant was legally insane. The use of defendant\u2019s statement for that purpose contravened <em>Greenfield.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b240-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>MOSK, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ANA\">I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">Defendant is an African-American. He was tried by a jury from which all prospective jurors of his own race had been excluded by the prosecutor, and was convicted, found sane, and sentenced to death in accordance with that jury\u2019s verdicts and findings. If supported by a good reason on the prosecutor\u2019s part or at least not by a bad one, such exclusion would be unobjectionable under the law. If not, it would amount to a reversible-per-se violation of defendant\u2019s right to trial by a jury drawn from a representative cross section of the community under article I, section 16 of the California Constitution, as construed in <em>People </em>v. <em>Wheeler </em>(1978) 22 Cal.3d 258 [148 Cal.Rptr. 890, 583 P.2d 748], and it would also amount to a separate and independent reversible-per-se violation of his right to equal protection of the laws under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, as construed in <em>Batson </em>v. <em>Kentucky </em>(1986) 476 U.S. 79 [106 S.Ct. 1712, 90 L.Ed.2d 69]. Regrettably, the exclusion in question shows itself to fall in the latter category.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">Under both <em>Wheeler </em>and <em>Batson, </em>there is a presumption that a prosecutor exercises his peremptory challenges without a purpose to discriminate. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Alvarez </em>(1996) 14 Cal.4th 155,193 [58 Cal.Rptr.2d 385, 926 P.2d 365].) The defendant bears the burden to show, prima facie, the presence of prohibited intent. <em>(Ibid.) </em>If he succeeds, the burden shifts to the prosecutor to show its absence. <em>(Ibid.) </em>If <em>he </em>fails, the intent in question is established. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b240-7\">During jury selection, defendant moved to quash the panel and to commence the process anew on the ground that the prosecutor had exercised his peremptory challenges against African-American prospective jurors with a purpose to discriminate. The prosecutor had faced three such persons, and three such persons only: Judith Credic, Donald Haynes, and Audrey Parker. He had stricken each and every one, and had thereby obtained an all-White jury. The court impliedly found that defendant made a prima facie showing of prohibited intent. The prosecutor stated what he said were his reasons. The court then found that the prosecutor showed the absence of such intent\u2014\u201cI will find that there is no <em>Wheeler\u201d </em>or <em>Batson </em>\u201cviolation based upon the explanation that\u201d the prosecutor \u201chas given as to each and every one of the three jurors\u201d (italics added)\u2014and proceeded to deny the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-8\">The court erred. The prosecutor simply did not show that he had exercised his peremptory challenges against the African-American prospective jurors without a purpose to discriminate. We need not consider his stated reasons as to each of the three. If they are insufficient as to any one, they are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>insufficient as to all. To strike even a single prospective juror with prohibited intent reversibly violates the defendant\u2019s state and federal constitutional rights. (See, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Clair </em>(1992) 2 Cal.4th 629, 653 [7 Cal.Rptr.2d 564, 828 P.2d 705].) The prosecutor so struck Audrey Parker. He purported to explain his action thus: \u201cShe could only go for the death penalty in some cases if there was no insanity.\u201d \u201cThat was my primary reason, because I felt that she would cut [defendant] slack. None of\u2019 certain other prospective jurors \u201cindicated that they would cut or favor life without possibility of parole if there was a mental problem, and that is the guts and essence of the defense case here.\u201d The court credited the prosecutor\u2019s explanation. Its view should of course be deferred to if supported by substantial evidence. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Alvarez, supra, </em>14 Cal.4th at pp. 196-197.) It is not. The prosecutor\u2019s unfortunate complaint that Parker \u201ccould only go for the death penalty ... if there was no insanity\u201d trips him up. On voir dire, Parker demonstrated that she could, and would, follow the law in this cause. Thus hemmed in by the facts, all the prosecutor could do\u2014and did\u2014was to try to salvage his strike by effectively charging that <em>she would </em>abide <em>by the juror\u2019s oath.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">In view of the foregoing, I am compelled to conclude that the exclusion by the prosecutor of all the African-American prospective jurors from defendant\u2019s jury violated his state and federal constitutional rights and requires reversal of the judgment in its entirety. <footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">Appellant\u2019s petition for a rehearing was denied April 30, 1997, and the opinion was modified to read as printed above. Mosk, J., and Werdegar, J., were of the opinion that the petition should be granted.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b241-7\"> Because of the conclusion I reach, I need not, and do not, proceed further. Were I to do so, I would join Justice Werdegar\u2019s concurring and dissenting opinion in its treatment of the sanity and penalty phases of defendant\u2019s trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
