Code, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"870\">*870</page-number>\u00a7 105275 et seq.).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Act provided evaluation, screening, and medically necessary follow-up services for children who were deemed potential victims of lead poisoning. The Act\u2019s program was entirely supported by \u201cfees\u201d assessed on manufacturers or other persons contributing to environmental lead contamination. (See \u00a7\u00a7 105305, 105310.) The question arises whether these fees were in legal effect \u201ctaxes\u201d required to be enacted by a two-thirds vote of the Legislature. (See Cal. Const., art. XIII A, \u00a7 3.)</p>\n<p id=\"b908-4\">Contrary to the trial court and Court of Appeal, we conclude that the Act imposed bona fide regulatory fees, not taxes, because the Legislature imposed the fees to mitigate the actual or anticipated adverse effects of the fee payers\u2019 operations, and under the Act the amount of the fees must bear a reasonable relationship to those adverse effects. Accordingly, the trial court erred in granting summary judgment to award plaintiff Sinclair Paint Company (Sinclair) a refund of the fees it paid under the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-5\">We take the following statement of uncontradicted facts largely from the Court of Appeal opinion in this case. Sinclair paid $97,825.26 in fees for 1991. After the Board of Equalization (the Board) denied Sinclair\u2019s administrative claim for refund, Sinclair filed a complaint for refund, alleging the fees assessed under section 105310 were \u201cactually taxes imposed by the California [Legislature in violation of Proposition 13, Article XIIIA, Section 3 of the California Constitution.\u201d The court granted the request of the Department of Health Services (the Department) for leave to intervene. It also granted a similar request to intervene by Ray Cochenour and Cardaryl Commodore, representatives of a class of children suffering from lead poisoning, and People United for a Better Oakland, an unincorporated association whose members include the Act\u2019s intended beneficiaries (collectively Cochenour).</p>\n<p id=\"b908-6\">Sinclair moved for summary judgment, claiming the Act was invalid on its face because it was not passed by the requisite two-thirds majority vote of the Legislature. The court agreed the Act imposed an unconstitutional tax and granted Sinclair\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-7\">The Board, the Department, and Cochenour appealed, contending the Act involves a regulatory fee, not a tax. Appellants also argued the court erred in granting Sinclair summary judgment without compelling it to produce discovery and improperly relied on legislative history in determining the Act\u2019s constitutionality. The Court of Appeal affirmed the judgment, concluding that the Act was unconstitutional on its face and rejecting appellants\u2019 other claims. We reverse the Court of Appeal\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"871\">*871</page-number>Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b909-4\">I. <em>The Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention Act of 1991</em></p>\n<p id=\"b909-5\">When the Legislature enacted the Act in 1991, it explained the Act\u2019s background and purpose in findings that described the numerous health hazards children face when exposed to lead toxicity and declared four state \u201cgoals,\u201d namely, (1) evaluating, screening, and providing case management for children at risk of lead poisoning, (2) identifying sources of lead contamination responsible for this poisoning, (3) identifying and utilizing programs providing adequate case management for children found to have lead poisoning, and (4) providing education on lead-poisoning detection and case management to state health care providers. (Stats. 1991, ch. 799, \u00a7 1.)</p>\n<p id=\"b909-6\">The Act directs the Department to adopt regulations establishing a standard of care for evaluation, screening (i.e., measuring lead concentration in blood), and medically necessary follow-up services for children determined to be at risk of lead poisoning. (\u00a7 105285; see \u00a7 105280, subd. (e).) If a child is identified as being at risk of lead poisoning, the Department must ensure \u201cappropriate case management,\u201d i.e., \u201chealth care referrals, environmental assessments, and educational activities\u201d needed to reduce the child\u2019s exposure to lead and its consequences. (\u00a7\u00a7 105280, subd. (a), 105290.) Additionally, the Act requires the Department to collect data and report on the effectiveness of case management efforts. (\u00a7 105295.)</p>\n<p id=\"b909-7\">The Department has \u201cbroad regulatory authority to fully implement and effectuate the purposes\u201d of the Act. (\u00a7 105300.) This authority \u201cincludefs], but is not limited to,\u201d the development of protocols for screening and for appropriate case management; the designation of laboratories qualified to analyze blood specimens for lead concentrations, and the monitoring of those laboratories for accuracy; the development of reporting procedures by laboratories; reimbursement for state-sponsored services related to screening and case management; establishment of lower lead concentrations in whole blood than those specified by the United States Centers for Disease Control for lead poisoning; notification to parents or guardians of the results of blood-lead testing and environmental assessment; and establishment of a periodicity schedule for evaluating childhood lead poisoning. (\u00a7 105300.)</p>\n<p id=\"b909-8\">The Act states that its program of evaluation, screening, and follow-up is supported <em>entirely </em>by fees collected under the Act: \u201cNotwithstanding the scope of activity mandated by this chapter, in no event shall this chapter be interpreted to require services necessitating expenditures in any fiscal year in excess of the fees, and earnings therefrom, collected pursuant to Section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"872\">*872</page-number>105310. This chapter shall be implemented only to the extent fee revenues pursuant to Section 105310 are available for expenditure for purposes of this chapter.\u201d (\u00a7 105305.)</p>\n<p id=\"b910-4\">Section 105310 imposes the fees at issue here. In pertinent part, that section imposes fees on manufacturers and other persons formerly and/or presently engaged in the stream of commerce of lead or products containing lead, or who are otherwise responsible for identifiable sources of lead, which have significantly contributed and/or currently contribute to environmental lead contamination. (\u00a7 105310, subd. (a).) The Department must determine fees based on the manufacturer\u2019s or other person\u2019s past and present responsibility for environmental lead contamination, or its \u201cmarket share\u201d responsibility for this contamination. (\u00a7 105310, subd. (b).)</p>\n<p id=\"b910-5\">Those persons able to show that their industry did not contribute to environmental lead contamination, or that their lead-containing product does not and did not \u201cresult in quantifiably persistent environmental lead contamination,\u201d are exempt from paying the fees. (\u00a7 105310, subd. (d).)</p>\n<p id=\"b910-6\">The Legislature has authorized the Department to adopt regulations establishing the specific fees to be assessed the parties identified in section 105310, subdivision (a). (\u00a7 105310, subd. (b).) The formula for calculating fees attributable to leaded architectural coatings, including ordinary house paint, is set forth in California Code of Regulations, title 17, section 33020.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-7\">II. <em>Proposition 13</em></p>\n<p id=\"b910-8\">In June 1978, California voters added article XIII A, commonly known as the Jarvis-Gann Property Tax Initiative or Proposition 13 (article XIII A), to the state Constitution. The initiative\u2019s purpose was to assure effective real property tax relief by means of an \u201cinterlocking \u2018package\u2019 \u201d consisting of a real property tax rate limitation (art. XIII A, \u00a7 1), a real property assessment limitation (art. XIII A, \u00a7 2), a restriction on state taxes (art. XIII A, \u00a7 3), and a restriction on local taxes (art. XIII A, \u00a7 4). <em>(Amador Valley Joint Union High Sch. Dist. </em>v. <em>State Bd. of Equalization </em>(1978) 22 Cal.3d 208, 231 [149 Cal.Rptr. 239, 583 P.2d 1281] <em>(Amador </em>Valley); see also <em>County of Los Angeles </em>v. <em>Sasaki </em>(1994) 23 Cal.App.4th 1442, 1451 [29 Cal.Rptr.2d 103].)</p>\n<p id=\"b910-9\">Section 3 of article XIII A restricts the enactment of changes in state taxes, as follows: \u201cFrom and after the effective date of this article, any changes in State taxes enacted for the purpose of increasing revenues collected pursuant thereto whether by increased rates or changes in methods <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"873\">*873</page-number>of computation must be imposed by an Act passed by not less than two-thirds of all members ... of the Legislature, except that no new ad valorem taxes on real property, or sales or transaction taxes on the sales of real property may be imposed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b911-4\">Section 4 of article XIII A imposes similar restrictions on local entities: \u201cCities, Counties and special districts, by a two-thirds vote of the qualified electors of such district, may impose <em>special taxes </em>on such district, except ad valorem taxes on real property or a transaction tax or sales tax on the sale of real property within such City, County or special district.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b911-5\">As we explained in <em>Amador Valley, </em>\u201c. . . since any tax savings resulting from the operation of sections 1 and 2 [of article XIII A] could be withdrawn or depleted by additional or increased state or local levies of other than property taxes, sections 3 and 4 combine to place restrictions upon the imposition of such taxes.\u201d <em>(Amador Valley, supra, </em>22 Cal.3d at p. 231.)</p>\n<p id=\"b911-6\">III. <em>Taxes or Fees?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b911-7\">Are the \u201cfees\u201d section 105310 imposes in legal effect \u201ctaxes enacted for the purpose of increasing revenues\u201d under article XIII A, section 3, and therefore subject to a two-thirds majority vote? Although we have found no cases that interpret the language of section 3, several California appellate decisions have considered whether various fees are really \u201cspecial taxes\u201d under article XIII A, section 4. (See also <em>City and County of San Francisco </em>v. <em>Farrell </em>(1982) 32 Cal.3d 47, 57 [184 Cal.Rptr. 713, 648 P.2d 935] [\u201cspecial taxes\u201d are taxes levied for a specific purpose rather than for general governmental purposes]; Gov. Code, \u00a7 50076 [excluding from the term \u201cspecial tax\u201d in article XIII A, section 4, \u201cany fee which does not exceed the reasonable cost of providing the service or regulatory activity for which the fee is charged and which is not levied for general revenue purposes\u201d].) Because of the close, \u201cinterlocking\u201d relationship between the various sections of article XIII A (see <em>Amador Valley, supra, </em>22 Cal.3d at p. 231), we believe these \u201cspecial tax\u201d cases may be helpful, though not conclusive, in deciding the case before us. The reasons why particular fees are, or are not, \u201cspecial taxes\u201d under article XIII A, section 4, may apply equally to section 3 cases.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b911-8\">We first consider certain general guidelines used in determining whether \u201ctaxes\u201d are involved in particular situations.  The cases agree that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"874\">*874</page-number>whether impositions are \u201ctaxes\u201d or \u201cfees\u201d is a question of law for the appellate courts to decide on independent review of the facts. <em>(Bixel Associates </em>v. <em>City of Los Angeles </em>(1989) 216 Cal.App.3d 1208, 1216 [265 Cal.Rptr. 347]; <em>California Bldg. Industry Assn. </em>v. <em>Governing Bd. </em>(1988) 206 Cal.App.3d 212, 234 [253 Cal.Rptr. 497]; <em>Russ Bldg. Partnership </em>v. <em>City and County of San Francisco </em>(1987) 199 Cal.App.3d 1496, 1504 [246 Cal.Rptr. 21].)</p>\n<p id=\"b912-4\">The cases recognize that \u201ctax\u201d has no fixed meaning, and that the distinction between taxes and fees is frequently \u201cblurred,\u201d taking on different meanings in different contexts. <em>(Russ Bldg. Partnership </em>v. <em>City and County of San Francisco, supra, </em>199 Cal.App.3d at p. 1504; <em>Terminal Plaza Corp. </em>v. <em>City and County of San Francisco </em>(1986) 177 Cal.App.3d 892, 905 [223 Cal.Rptr. 379]; <em>Mills </em>v. <em>County of Trinity </em>(1980) 108 Cal.App.3d 656, 660 [166 Cal.Rptr. 674]; <em>County of Fresno </em>v. <em>Malmstrom </em>(1979) 94 Cal.App.3d 974, 983-984 [156 Cal.Rptr. 777].) In general, taxes are imposed for revenue purposes, rather than in return for a specific benefit conferred or privilege granted. <em>(Shapell Industries, Inc. </em>v. <em>Governing Board </em>(1991) 1 Cal.App.4th 218, 240 [1 Cal.Rptr.2d 818]; <em>County of Fresno </em>v. <em>Malmstrom, supra, </em>94 Cal.App.3d at p. 983 [\u201cTaxes are raised for the general revenue of the governmental entity to pay for a variety of public services.\u201d].) Most taxes are compulsory rather than imposed in response to a voluntary decision to develop or to seek other government benefits or privileges. <em>(Shapell Industries, Inc. </em>v. <em>Governing Board, supra, </em>1 Cal.App.4th at p. 240; <em>Russ Bldg. Partnership </em>v. <em>City and County of San Francisco, supra, </em>199 Cal.App.3d at pp. 1505-1506; see <em>Terminal Plaza Corp. </em>v. <em>City and County of San Francisco, supra, 177 </em>Cal.App.3d at p. 907.) But compulsory fees may be deemed legitimate fees rather than taxes. (See <em>Kern County Farm Bureau </em>v. <em>County of Kern </em>(1993) 19 Cal.App.4th 1416, 1424 [23 Cal.Rptr.2d 910].)</p>\n<p id=\"b912-5\">The \u201cspecial tax\u201d cases have involved three general categories of fees or assessments: (1) special assessments, based on the value of benefits conferred on property; (2) development fees, exacted in return for permits or other government privileges; and (3) regulatory fees, imposed under the police power. Although these three categories may overlap in a particular case, we consider them separately.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-6\">The cases uniformly hold that <em>special assessments </em>on property or similar business charges, in amounts reasonably reflecting the value of the benefits conferred by improvements, are not \u201cspecial taxes\u201d under article XIII A, section 4. <em>(Evans </em>v. <em>City of San Jose </em>(1992) 3 Cal.App.4th 728, 735-739 [4 Cal.Rptr.2d 601] [assessments on businesses for downtown promotion]; J. <em>W. Jones Companies </em>v. <em>City of San Diego </em>(1984) 157 Cal.App.3d 745, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"875\">*875</page-number>750-758 [203 Cal.Rptr. 580] [facilities benefit assessments]; <em>City Council </em>v. <em>South </em>(1983) 146 Cal.App.3d 320, 332 [194 Cal.Rptr. 110] [special assessments on real property]; <em>County of Fresno </em>v. <em>Malmstrom, supra, </em>94 Cal.App.3d at pp. 984-985 [special assessments for construction of streets].)</p>\n<p id=\"b913-4\">Similarly, <em>development fees </em>exacted in return for building permits or other governmental privileges are not special taxes if the amount of the fees bears a reasonable relation to the development\u2019s probable costs to the community and benefits to the developer. <em>(Shapell Industries, Inc. </em>v. <em>Governing Board, supra, </em>1 Cal.App.4th at p. 240 [school facilities fees]; <em>Bixel Associates </em>v. <em>City of Los Angeles, supra, </em>216 Cal.App.3d at pp. 1211, 1218-1219 [fire hydrant fees]; <em>California Bldg.

As the Court of Appeal observed, the fees challenged here \u201cdo not constitute payment for a government benefit or service. The program described in the Act bears no resemblance to regulatory schemes involving special assessments, developer fees, or efforts to recoup the cost of processing land use applications where the benefit analysis is typically applied. [Citations.] The face of the Act makes clear the funds collected pursuant to section 105310 are used to benefit children exposed to lead, not Sinclair or other manufacturers in the stream of commerce for products containing lead.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b913-6\">Appellants argue, however, that the challenged fees fall squarely within a third recognized category not dependent on government-conferred benefits or privileges, namely, <em>regulatory fees </em>imposed under the police power, rather than the taxing power. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"876\">*876</page-number>We have acknowledged that the term \u201cspecial taxes\u201d in article XIII A, section 4, \u201c \u2018does not embrace fees charged in connection with regulatory activities which fees do not exceed the reasonable cost of providing services necessary to the activity for which the fee is charged and which are not levied for unrelated revenue purposes.\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Pennell </em>v. <em>City of San Jose </em>(1986) 42 Cal.3d 365, 375 [228 Cal.Rptr. 726, 721 P.2d 1111] <em>(Pennell), </em>affd. on other grounds <em>sub nom.

We explained in <em>Pennell </em>that regulatory fees in amounts necessary to carry out the regulation\u2019s purpose are valid despite the absence of any perceived \u201cbenefit\u201d accruing to the fee payers. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 375, fn. 11; see also <em>SDG&amp;E, supra, </em>203 Cal.App.3d at p. 1146, fn. 18; <em>Mills </em>v. <em>County of Trinity, supra, </em>108 Cal.App.3d at p. 661.)</p>\n<p id=\"b914-5\">We observe that Sinclair, in moving for summary judgment, did not contend that the fees exceed in amount the reasonable cost of providing the protective services for which the fees are charged, or that the fees were levied for any <em>unrelated </em>revenue purposes. (See <em>Pennell, supra, </em>42 Cal.3d at p. 375.) Moreover, Sinclair has not yet sought to establish that the amount of the fees bears no reasonable relationship to the social or economic \u201cburdens\u201d that Sinclair\u2019s operations generated. (See <em>SDG&amp;E, supra, </em>203 Cal.App.3d at p. 1146; see also \u00a7 105310, subds.

Sinclair does contend, however, that the Act is not <em>regulatory </em>in nature, being primarily aimed at producing revenue.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-4\">According to Sinclair, the challenged fees were in effect \u201ctaxes\u201d because the compulsory revenue measure that imposed them was not part of a <em>regulatory </em>effort. The Court of Appeal agreed, relying on prior cases indicating that where payments are exacted solely for <em>revenue </em>purposes and give the right to carry on the business with no further conditions, they are taxes. (E.g., <em>United Business, supra, </em>91 Cal.App.3d at p. 165.) The Court of Appeal held that \u201cPlacing the factors distinguishing taxes and fees along a continuum, we conclude the monies paid by Sinclair pursuant to the Act are more like taxes than fees. [\u00b6] <em>There is nothing on the face of the Act to show the fees collected are used to regulate Sinclair. </em>Apart from mere calculation of the payment, the Department\u2019s regulatory authority involves implementation of the program to evaluate, screen, and provide followup services to children at risk for lead poisoning. The Act does not require Sinclair to comply with any other conditions; it merely requires Sinclair to pay what the Department determines to be its share of the program cost.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b915-5\">Contrary to the Court of Appeal, we believe that section 105310 imposes bona fide regulatory fees. It requires manufacturers and other persons whose products have exposed children to lead contamination to bear a fair share of the cost of mitigating the adverse health effects their products created in the community. Viewed as a \u201cmitigating effects\u201d measure, it is comparable in character to similar police power measures imposing fees to defray the actual or anticipated adverse effects of various business operations.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-6\">From the viewpoint of general police power authority, we see no reason why statutes or ordinances calling on polluters or producers of contaminating products to help in mitigation or cleanup efforts should be deemed less \u201cregulatory\u201d in nature than the initial permit or licensing programs that allowed them to operate. Moreover, imposition of \u201cmitigating effects\u201d fees in a substantial amount (Sinclair allegedly paid $97,825.26 in 1991) also \u201cregulates\u201d future conduct by deterring further manufacture, distribution, or sale of dangerous products, and by stimulating research and development efforts to produce safer or alternative products. (Cf. <em>SDG&amp;E, supra, </em>203 Cal.App.3d at p. 1147, fn. 20 [emissions-based fees provide incentive to use nonpollutant fuels].)</p>\n<p id=\"b915-7\">Sinclair disputes the state\u2019s authority to impose industry-wide \u201cremediation fees\u201d to compensate for the adverse societal effects generated by an industry\u2019s products. To the contrary, the case law previously cited or discussed clearly indicates that the police power is broad enough to include <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"878\">*878</page-number>mandatory remedial measures to mitigate the <em>past, present, or future </em>adverse impact of the fee payer\u2019s operations, at least where, as here, the measure requires a causal connection or nexus between the product and its adverse effects.

There, 1982 legislation (see \u00a7 42311) empowered local air pollution control districts to apportion the costs of their permit programs among all monitored polluters according to a formula based on the amount of emissions they discharged. (See <em>SDG&amp;E, supra, </em>203 Cal.App.3d at p. 1135.)  The <em>SDG&amp;E </em>court observed that \u201cto show a fee is a regulatory fee and not a special tax, the government should prove (1) the estimated costs of the service or regulatory activity, and (2) the basis for determining the manner in which the costs are apportioned, so that charges allocated to a payor bear a fair or reasonable relationship to the payor\u2019s burdens on or benefits from the regulatory activity.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1146, fn. omitted; see <em>Beaumont Investors </em>v. <em>Beaumont-Cherry Valley Water Dist., supra, </em>165 Cal.App.3d at pp. 234-235.)</p>\n<p id=\"b916-5\">In <em>SDG&amp;E, </em>the amount of the regulatory fees was limited to the reasonable costs of each district\u2019s program, and the allocation of costs based on emissions \u201cfairly relates to the permit holder\u2019s burden on the district\u2019s programs.\u201d <em>(SDG&amp;E, supra, </em>203 Cal.App.3d at p. 1146.) Accordingly, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"879\">*879</page-number>court concluded that the fees were not \u201cspecial taxes\u201d under article XIII A, section 4. <em>(SDG&amp;E, supra, </em>203 Cal.App.3d at p. 1148.)</p>\n<p id=\"b917-4\">As the court observed in <em>SDG&amp;E, </em>\u201cProposition 13\u2019s goal of providing effective property tax relief is not subverted by the increase in fees or the emissions-based apportionment formula. A reasonable way to achieve Proposition 13\u2019s goal of tax relief is to shift the costs of controlling stationary sources of pollution from the tax-paying public to the pollution-causing industries themselves . . . .\u201d <em>(SDG&amp;E, supra, </em>203 Cal.App.3d at p. 1148.)  In our view, the shifting of costs of providing evaluation, screening, and medically necessary follow-up services for potential child victims of lead poisoning from the public to those persons deemed responsible for that poisoning is likewise a reasonable police power decision. (See also <em>Mills </em>v. <em>County of Trinity, supra, </em>108 Cal.App.3d at p. 663; <em>County of Fresno </em>v. <em>Malmstrom, supra, </em>94 Cal.App.3d at p. 985 [special assessments have no impact on government spending].)</p>\n<p id=\"b917-5\">The fact that the challenged fees were charged after, rather than before, the product\u2019s adverse effects were realized is immaterial to the question whether the measure imposes valid regulatory fees rather than taxes. <em>City of Oakland </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>seems close on point. There, the court upheld city fees imposed on retailers of alcoholic beverages to defray the cost of providing and administering hearings into nuisance problems associated with the prior sale of those beverages. The court first observed that \u201cIf a business imposes an unusual burden on city services, a municipality may properly impose fees pursuant to its police powers\u201d to assure that the persons responsible \u201cpay their fair share of the cost of government.\u201d <em>(City of Oakland </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>45 Cal.App.4th at p. 761.) The court concluded that \u201cThe ordinance\u2019s primary purpose is regulatory\u2014to create an environment in which nuisance and criminal activities associated with alcoholic beverage retail establishments may be reduced or eliminated. Thus, the fee imposed . . . is not a tax imposed to pay general revenue to the local governmental entity, but is a regulatory fee intended to defray the cost of providing and administering the hearing process set out in the ordinance. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 762.)</p>\n<p id=\"b917-6\">The court in <em>United Business </em>applied the \u201cregulation/revenue\u201d distinction to conclude that sign inventory fees adopted to recover the city\u2019s cost of inventorying signs and bringing them into conformance with law were regulatory fees, not revenue-raising taxes. The court observed that, under the police power, municipalities may impose fees for the purpose of legitimate regulation, and not mere revenue raising, if the fees do not exceed the reasonably necessary expense of the regulatory effort. <em>(United Business, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"880\">*880</page-number><em>supra, </em>91 Cal.App.3d at p. 165, and authorities cited.) Quoting with approval from an earlier decision, the court noted that, if revenue is the primary purpose, and regulation is merely incidental, the imposition is a tax, but if regulation is the primary purpose, the mere fact that revenue is also obtained does not make the imposition a tax. <em>(Ibid.) </em>Moreover, according to <em>United Business, </em>if a fee is exacted for revenue purposes, and its payment gives the right to carry on business without any further conditions, it is a tax. (Ibid.; see also <em>City of Oakland </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>45 Cal.App.4th at p. 761; <em>County of Plumas </em>v. <em>Wheeler, supra, </em>149 Cal. at p. 763 [fee in amount greater than reasonably needed to regulate business \u201ccannot stand as an exercise of the police power\u201d]; <em>Mills </em>v. <em>County of Trinity, supra, </em>108 Cal.App.3d at pp. 659-660; <em>City &amp; County of San Francisco </em>v. <em>Boss </em>(1948) 83 Cal.App.2d 445, 450-451 [189 P.2d 32].)</p>\n<p id=\"b918-4\">The Court of Appeal, citing <em>United Business, </em>stressed that the challenged fees were exacted solely for revenue purposes, and their payment gave Sinclair and others the right to carry on the business without any further conditions. We see two flaws in that analysis. First, <em>all </em>regulatory fees are necessarily aimed at raising \u201crevenue\u201d to defray the cost of the regulatory program in question, but that fact does not automatically render those fees \u201ctaxes.\u201d As stated in <em>United Business, </em>if regulation is the primary purpose of the fee measure, the mere fact that the measure also generates revenue does not make the imposition a tax. <em>(United Business, supra, </em>91 Cal.App.3d at p. 165; see also <em>Mills </em>v. <em>County of Trinity, supra, </em>108 Cal.App.3d at p. 660 [rejecting broad definition of \u201ctax\u201d as including all fees and charges that exact money for public purposes].)</p>\n<p id=\"b918-5\">Second, we find inconclusive the fact that the Act permits Sinclair and other producers to carry on their operations without any further conditions <em>specified in the Act itself. </em>As we have indicated, fees can \u201cregulate\u201d business entities without directly licensing them by mitigating their operations\u2019 adverse effects. Moreover, as appellants observe, the Act is part of a broader regulatory scheme by which, under various state and federal statutes, the state regulates Sinclair and other manufacturers in the stream of commerce for products containing lead. That being so, Sinclair\u2019s payment of the challenged fees did not confer the right to carry on business without any further conditions or regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-6\">The Court of Appeal rejected appellants\u2019 argument invoking other state and federal regulations: \u201cFirst, there is nothing on the face of the Act or the accompanying statement of legislative purpose which links the Act\u2019s programs for children at risk for lead poisoning with the cited state or federal statutes regulating lead. Second, none of the fees collected pursuant to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"881\">*881</page-number>section 105310 are used to fund those regulatory efforts.\u201d However, it is undisputed that Sinclair and other manufacturers of lead-based products remain subject to government regulation, that payment of the challenged fees therefore does not entitle those manufacturers to operate free of regulation, and that the state must use the funds it collects under section 105310 <em>exclusively </em>for mitigating the adverse effects of lead poisoning of children, and not for general revenue purposes. (\u00a7 105310, subd. (f).)</p>\n<p id=\"b919-4\">Under existing case law, we can reasonably characterize the challenged fees as <em>regulatory fees </em>rather than as taxes. Accordingly, we conclude the trial court erred in granting Sinclair summary judgment on the constitutional issues. Of course, Sinclair should be permitted to attempt to prove at trial that the amount of fees assessed and paid exceeded the reasonable cost of providing the protective services for which the fees were charged, or that the fees were levied for unrelated revenue purposes. (See <em>Pennell, supra, </em>42 Cal.3d at p. 375.) Additionally, Sinclair will have the opportunity to try to show that no clear nexus exists between its products and childhood lead poisoning, or that the amount of the fees bore no reasonable relationship to the social or economic \u201cburdens\u201d its operations generated. <em>(SDG&amp;E, supra, </em>203 Cal.App.3d. at p. 1146; see also \u00a7 105310, subds. (b), (d).)</p>\n<p id=\"b919-5\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b919-6\">The judgment of the Court of Appeal, affirming the trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in Sinclair\u2019s favor, is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-7\">George, C.
