Code,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u00a7 667, subd. (d)(3)(C)), and (2) whether a prior juvenile adjudication for residential burglary qualifies as a \u201cstrike\u201d (\u00a7 667, subd. (d)(3)). We conclude that no express finding of fitness is required, and that under the circumstances of this case we need not reach the issue of whether a prior juvenile adjudication for residential burglary qualifies as a \u201cstrike.\u201d Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1136-11\">I. Facts and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b1136-12\">By information filed on June 8, 1994, the Contra Costa County District Attorney charged defendant Robert Vonroski Davis (defendant) with one count of murder (\u00a7 187), and one count of attempted murder (\u00a7\u00a7 187, 664) with allegations as to both counts that he personally used a handgun (\u00a7 12022.5, subd. (a)). In addition, three prior convictions were alleged under section 667, subdivisions (b)-(i) (the legislative version of the three strikes law): a 1990 juvenile adjudication of felony assault (\u00a7 245); a 1991 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1099\">*1099</page-number>juvenile adjudication of residential burglary (\u00a7 459, former \u00a7 460.1 [now \u00a7 460, subd. (a)]); and a 1993 adult robbery conviction (\u00a7 211). Defendant pled not guilty and denied the prior conviction allegations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1137-5\">Defendant subsequently moved to strike the two prior juvenile adjudications in part on the ground that they did not satisfy the terms of section 667, subdivision (d)(3). The trial court granted the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1137-6\">The People appealed. While the appeal was pending, a jury convicted defendant of murder and attempted murder. The prior robbery conviction allegation was found true. Defendant was sentenced to 35 years to life with a consecutive term of life plus 5 years.</p>\n<p id=\"b1137-7\">The Court of Appeal affirmed the trial court\u2019s order striking the prior juvenile adjudication for residential burglary and reversed the trial court\u2019s order striking the prior juvenile adjudication for felony assault. On that same day, the court affirmed in a separate opinion defendant\u2019s convictions for murder and attempted murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b1137-8\">We granted both the Attorney General\u2019s and defendant\u2019s petitions for review limited to the issues stated above, and subsequently designated the Attorney General petitioner for purposes of briefing and oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b1137-9\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b1137-10\">\u201cIn March 1994, the Legislature enacted its version of the \u2018Three Strikes and You\u2019re Out\u2019 law by amending section 667. In general, the legislation provides longer sentences for certain prior serious or violent felonies popularly denoted \u2018strikes.\u2019 A \u2018two strike\u2019 case involves one prior qualifying felony; a \u2018three strike\u2019 case involves two or more prior qualifying felonies. Predicate prior felonies are defined in section 667, subdivision (d), as: \u2018(1) Any offense defined in subdivision (c) of Section 667.5 as a violent felony or any offense defined in subdivision (c) of Section 1192.7 as a serious felony in this state\u2019; \u2018(2) A conviction in another jurisdiction for an offense that, if committed in California, is punishable by imprisonment in the state prison [and] . . . includes all of the elements of the particular felony as defined in subdivision (c) of Section 667.5 or subdivision (c) of Section 1192.7\u2019; and \u2018(3) [Certain] prior juvenile adjudication^].\u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Hazelton </em>(1996) 14 Cal.4th 101, 104 [58 Cal.Rptr.2d 443, 926 P.2d 423].) The statute\u2019s unambiguous purpose is to provide greater punishment for recidivists. (\u00a7 667, subd. (b).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1138-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1100\">*1100</page-number>Section 667, subdivision (d)(3),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> lists the requirements for a prior juvenile adjudication to qualify as a \u201cstrike.\u201d It provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1138-5\">\u201c[(d)](3) A prior juvenile adjudication shall constitute a prior felony conviction for purposes of sentence enhancement if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1138-6\">\u201c(A) The juvenile was 16 years of age or older at the time he or she committed the prior offense.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1138-7\">\u201c(B) The prior offense is listed in subdivision (b) of Section 707 of the Welfare and Institutions Code or described in paragraph (1) [California prior serious or violent felony convictions] or (2) [other jurisdiction prior serious or violent felony convictions] as a felony.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1138-8\">\u201c(C) The juvenile was found to be a fit and proper subject to be dealt with under the juvenile court law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1138-9\">\u201c(D) The juvenile was adjudged a ward of the juvenile court within the meaning of Section 602 of the Welfare and Institutions Code because the person committed an offense listed in subdivision (b) of Section 707 of the Welfare and Institutions Code.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1138-10\">Defendant contends that neither his prior juvenile adjudication for residential burglary nor for felony assault meets the requirements of section 667, subdivision (d)(3)(C) (subdivision (d)(3)(C)), because there was no express finding of fitness. Defendant further contends that his prior juvenile adjudication for residential burglary does not meet the requirements of section 667, subdivision (d)(3)(D), because that offense is not included in Welfare and Institutions Code section 707, subdivision (b), as it existed on June 30, 1993 (former section 707(b)).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1138-11\">We first consider the meaning of subdivision (d)(3)(C)\u2019s requirement that the juvenile was \u201cfound to be a fit and proper subject to be dealt with under the juvenile court law.\u201d Defendant contends that an express finding of fitness is required; the Attorney General asserts that an implied finding is sufficient. We agree with the Attorney General.</p>\n<p id=\"b1138-12\">Under Welfare and Institutions Code section 602, \u201cAny person who is under the age of 18 years when he violates any law of this state or of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1101\">*1101</page-number>United States or any ordinance of any city or county of this state defining crime other than an ordinance establishing a curfew based solely on age, is within the jurisdiction of the juvenile court, which may adjudge such person to be a ward of the court.\u201d  A petition under this section \u201cis the equivalent of a complaint in the adult court.\u201d (1 Cal. Juvenile Court Practice (Cont.Ed.Bar 1981) \u00a7 1.8, p. 22.)  The prosecutor may, however, also file a petition under Welfare and Institutions Code section 707 seeking a determination that the minor is unfit for treatment in the juvenile court system. (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 707, subds. (a), (c).) When the juvenile is charged with a crime falling within former section 707(b), and a Welfare and Institutions Code section 707 petition is filed, the minor is \u201cpresumed to be not a fit and proper subject to be dealt with under the juvenile court law unless the juvenile court concludes . . . that the minor would be amenable to the care, treatment, and training program available through the facilities of the juvenile court based upon an evaluation of\u201d various criteria. (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 707, subd. (c).) If the juvenile court makes a finding of fitness, it makes \u201c[a] determination that the minor is a fit and proper subject to be dealt with under the juvenile court law . . . .\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1139-5\">Thus, the only circumstance under which an express finding of fitness occurs in juvenile court is when the prosecutor unsuccessfully seeks to have the juvenile tried in adult court. Defendant therefore contends that the \u201cuse of this precise language which is only used within the context of a [section] 707 petition must have been intended as a requirement that there have been a fitness hearing and evaluation with supporting findings.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1139-6\">We disagree. An express finding of fitness is necessary in the context of a ruling on a Welfare and Institutions Code section 707 petition based on a former section 707(b) offense because the minor is presumed to be unfit. (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 707, subd. (c).) Thus, the juvenile court must explain why the presumption of unfitness was rebutted in that particular case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1139-7\">Subdivision (d)(3)(C), however, refers neither to a Welfare and Institutions Code section 707 petition nor to an express finding of fitness. Rather, it merely requires that the juvenile was \u201cfound to be a fit and proper subject to be dealt with under the juvenile court law.\u201d This, of course, includes the situation where a Welfare and Institutions Code section 707 petition based on a former section 707(b) offense was denied. It also reasonably includes the situation where the prosecutor does not file a Welfare and Institutions Code section 707 petition. As the Court of Appeal recognized, \u201c [proceedings under section 602 with the resulting adjudication of wardship and treatment of the minor under the jurisdiction of the juvenile court constituted an implied finding that the minor is a \u2018fit and proper subject to be dealt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1102\">*1102</page-number>with under the juvenile court law.\u2019 \u201d By its terms, subdivision (d)(3)(C) requires a finding, not an express finding, of fitness. Accordingly, nothing in the subdivision\u2019s language precludes the inclusion of implied as well as express findings of fitness. Moreover, the suitability requirement helps distinguish those offenses committed by minors 16 or over that are adjudicated in juvenile court rather than as adult offenses. Indeed, if subdivision (d)(3)(C) were construed to require an express finding of fitness, this would so severely limit those juvenile adjudications that would qualify as \u201cstrikes,\u201d that such a result would seem to be at odds with the intent of section 667, subdivisions (b)-(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b1140-5\">Finally, a conclusion that subdivision (d)(3)(C) requires an express finding of fitness would evoke questions regarding the statute\u2019s constitutional validity. The difference in punishment that two otherwise similarly situated defendants would receive would depend solely on an <em>unsuccessful </em>motion for a determination that the minor is unfit for treatment in the juvenile court system. An express finding requirement would be analogous to a statute that set the punishment for a manslaughter conviction at five years if the prosecution originally charged the case as manslaughter, but ten years if the prosecution originally charged the case as murder and the defendant was convicted of the lesser charge of manslaughter. Such a statute would arguably be open to a variety of constitutional challenges such as equal protection, due process, and separation of powers. We see no basis for concluding that the Legislature made such an arguably irrational distinction here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1140-6\">Defendant asserts that concluding an implied finding satisfies subdivision (d)(3)(C) renders that subdivision superfluous. He essentially argues that subdivision (d)(3)(C) would then apply to anyone tried in juvenile, as opposed to adult court, and subdivision (d)(3) already expressly applies to prior juvenile adjudications. However, the presence of some duplication in a multiprong statutory test does not automatically render it meaningless. Moreover, subdivision (d)(3) is arguably superfluous in part no matter how we interpret it. If we interpret it, as defendant argues, to require an express finding of fitness, then the requirement that the juvenile was 16 years old at the time of committing the offense is redundant. (\u00a7 667, subd. (d)(3)(A).) As the statute existed on the relevant date, June 30,1993 (\u00a7 667, subd. (h)), only juveniles who were 16 years old at the time of committing the offense could be treated as adults, and thus there could only be an express fitness finding as to those juveniles. (Former Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 707, subd. (c); see also former \u00a7 707, subd. (a).) Thus, merely discerning that parts of the statute are repetitive does little to inform our analysis of its content. For the reasons set forth above, we conclude the more reasonable interpretation is that an implied finding of fitness satisfies subdivision (d)(3)(C). The trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1103\">*1103</page-number>therefore erred in striking defendant\u2019s prior juvenile adjudications for felony assault and residential burglary on this ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b1141-5\">Given our conclusion on this issue, defendant has at least two \u201cstrikes,\u201d i.e., a 1990 juvenile adjudication of felony assault, and a 1993 adult robbery conviction. He thus already qualifies for the harsher punishment prescriptions of the three strikes statute. We decline under these circumstances to decide whether defendant\u2019s juvenile adjudication for residential burglary also counts as a \u201cstrike.\u201d We therefore leave this issue for another day.</p>\n<p id=\"b1141-6\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b1141-7\">The judgment of the Court of Appeal is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1141-8\">George, C.

For enhancement of sentence, he was alleged to have personally used a firearm in each. For the same purpose, under the legislative version of the so-called \u201cThree Strikes\u201d law (Stats. 1994, ch. 12, \u00a7\u00a7 1-2), which is codified in Penal Code section 667, subdivisions (b) to (i) (hereafter sometimes section 667(b) to (i)),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> he was alleged to have suffered the following \u201cstrikes\u201d: (1) a prior juvenile adjudication, under section 667(d)(3), for assault; (2) a prior juvenile adjudication, also under section 667(d)(3), for residential burglary; and (3) a prior felony conviction, under section 667(d)(1), for robbery. Defendant moved to dismiss both of the prior juvenile adjudication allegations. The superior court granted the motion and entered an order accordingly. In its judgment on appeal, the Court of Appeal affirmed as to residential burglary, but reversed as to assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b1141-11\">The majority now proceed to affirm the Court of Appeal\u2019s judgment, specifically, its reversal of the superior court\u2019s order dismissing the prior juvenile adjudication allegation as to assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b1141-12\">As I shall explain, they should not.</p>\n<p id=\"b1141-13\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1141-14\">Section 667(c) provides that, \u201c[n]otwithstanding any other law, if a defendant has been convicted of a felony and it has been pled and proved that\u201d he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1104\">*1104</page-number>\u201chas one or more prior felony convictions as defined in\u201d section 667(d), \u201cthe court shall\u201d sentence him as specified in section 667(b) to (i), which codify the Three Strikes law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1142-5\">Section 667(d) states that, \u201c [notwithstanding any other law and for the purposes of\u2019 section 667(b) to (i), \u201ca prior conviction of a felony shall be defined\u201d to include particular prior juvenile adjudications.</p>\n<p id=\"b1142-6\">Section 667(d)(3), with which we are centrally concerned, further states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1142-7\">\u201cA prior juvenile adjudication shall constitute a prior felony conviction for purposes of sentence enhancement\u201d\u2014that is, shall amount to a strike\u2014\u201cif:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1142-8\">\u201c(A) The juvenile was 16 years of age or older at the time he or she committed the prior offense.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1142-9\">\u201c(B) The prior offense is listed in subdivision (b) of Section 707 of the Welfare and Institutions Code\u201d\u2014and therefore presumptively warranted trial of the juvenile in criminal court as an adult and not adjudication in juvenile court as a minor\u2014or is \u201cdescribed ... as a felony\u201d in section 667(d)(1) or (d)(2). (Section 667(d)(1) covers \u201cviolent\u201d (Pen. Code, \u00a7 667.5, subd. (c)) and \u201cserious\u201d <em>(id., </em>\u00a7 1192.7, subd. (c)) felonies under California law. Section 667(d)(2) covers \u201c[a] conviction in another jurisdiction for an offense that, if committed in California, is punishable by imprisonment in the state prison. A prior conviction of a particular felony shall include a conviction in another jurisdiction for an offense that includes all of the elements of the particular felony as defined\u201d as a \u201cviolent\u201d or \u201cserious\u201d felony in California.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1142-10\">\u201c(C) The juvenile was found to be a fit and proper subject to be dealt with under the juvenile court law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1142-11\">\u201c(D) The juvenile was adjudged a ward of the juvenile court within the meaning of Section 602 of the Welfare and Institutions Code because the person committed an offense listed in subdivision (b) of Section 707 of the Welfare and Institutions Code.\u201d (Pen. Code, \u00a7 667, subd. (d)(3).)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1142-12\">It follows that section 667(d)(3) states four requirements that must be satisfied for a prior juvenile adjudication to qualify as a strike.</p>\n<p id=\"b1142-13\">First, under section 667(d)(3)(A), the juvenile must have been at least 16 years old when he committed the offense resulting in the prior juvenile adjudication.</p>\n<p id=\"b1143-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1105\">*1105</page-number>Second, under section 667(d)(3)(B), the offense resulting in the prior juvenile adjudication must be one of the following: (1) the offenses listed in Welfare and Institutions Code section 707, subdivision (b), which are presumptively \u201cadult-criminal\u201d in nature (hereafter Welfare and Institutions Code section 707(b) offenses); (2) California \u201cviolent\u201d or \u201cserious\u201d felonies; and (3) specified out-of-state felonies. This provision thereby defines the substantive scope of possible strikes for prior juvenile adjudications.</p>\n<p id=\"b1143-5\">Third, under section 667(d)(3)(C), the juvenile must have been found by the juvenile court to be fit for juvenile court proceedings as a minor.</p>\n<p id=\"b1143-6\">Fourth and final, under section 667(d)(3)(D), the juvenile must have been adjudged by the juvenile court to have committed at least one, presumptively \u201cadult-criminal,\u201d Welfare and Institutions section 707(b) offense. This provision thereby imposes a procedural precondition for any actual strike for prior juvenile adjudications within the substantive scope of possible ones.</p>\n<p id=\"b1143-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1143-8\">Section 667(d)(3)(C) states one of the four requirements that must be satisfied for a prior juvenile adjudication to qualify as a strike under the Three Strikes law\u2014viz., the juvenile must have been found by the juvenile court to be fit for juvenile court proceedings as a minor.</p>\n<p id=\"b1143-9\">The juvenile court makes a finding of fitness only under Welfare and Institutions Code section 707. It does that only after it conducts a hearing on fitness. (See Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 707.) It does <em>that </em>only pursuant to a motion raising a doubt about fitness. (See <em>id., </em>subd. (a).) The motion may be made by the prosecutor. (See <em>ibid.) </em>It may also be made by the juvenile court <em>ex mero motu. (Green </em>v. <em>Municipal Court </em>(1976) 67 Cal.App.3d 794, 798-804 [136 Cal.Rptr. 710].) And it may even be made by the juvenile himself. (E.g., <em>Joey W. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 1167, 1171-1173 [9 Cal.Rptr.2d 486]; <em>In re Rodney F. </em>(1988) 203 Cal.App.3d 177, 181-186 [249 Cal.Rptr. 424].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1143-10\">To repeat: Section 667(d)(3)(C) requires a finding of fitness. That is what its words mean. That is the beginning of the matter and its end. (See <em>Kopp </em>v. <em>Fair Pol. Practices Com. </em>(1995) 11 Cal.4th 607, 672-673 [47 Cal.Rptr.2d 108, 905 P.2d 1248] (conc. opn. of Mosk, J.).) We may not pass on the wisdom of statutes. (See, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Zapien </em>(1993) 4 Cal.4th 929, 954 [17 Cal.Rptr.2d 122, 846 P.2d 704]; <em>Wells Fargo Bank </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1991) 53 Cal.3d 1082, 1099 [282 Cal.Rptr. 841, 811 P.2d 1025].) Of course, we may not evaluate the general end that the Legislature has sought, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1106\">*1106</page-number>which, according to its expressed intent, is \u201cto ensure longer prison sentences and greater punishment\u201d for certain recidivists under certain conditions (Pen. Code, \u00a7 667, subd. (b)). But neither may we assess the specific means that it has chosen\u2014which include the requirement of a finding of fitness.</p>\n<p id=\"b1144-5\">In this cause, the superior court properly dismissed both the residential burglary and assault prior juvenile adjudication allegations. As to each, the finding of fitness required by section 667(d)(3)(C) is lacking. As to neither was there any motion raising a doubt about fitness; as to neither was there any hearing on fitness; and as to neither, as stated, was there any finding of fitness.</p>\n<p id=\"b1144-6\">Beneath their discussion purporting to consider whether a finding of fitness must be express or may also be implied,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the majority remove the very requirement of such a finding contained in section 667(d)(3)(C) by construing it away. They do not demand any motion raising a doubt about fitness; they do not demand any hearing on fitness; and, as stated, they do not demand any finding of fitness. All that they ask for is a prior juvenile adjudication against a juvenile who was at least 16 years old when he committed the offense in question. But that is already required by section 667(d)(3)(A). They say that section 667(d)(3)(C) \u201chelps distinguish those offenses committed by minors 16 or over that are adjudicated in juvenile court rather than as adult offenses.\u201d (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 1102.) It does not. Section 667(d)(3)(A) and (d)(3)(D) make that distinction. They need no help.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1144-7\">The majority attempt to justify their removal of the requirement of a finding of fitness contained in section 667(d)(3)(C) by arguing that the retention of such a requirement \u201cwould so severely limit those juvenile adjudications that would qualify as \u2018strikes,\u2019 that such a result would seem to be at odds with the\u201d Legislature\u2019s expressed intent. (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 1102.) They fail to persuade.</p>\n<p id=\"b1145-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1107\">*1107</page-number>At the threshold, the majority\u2019s argument comes close to passing on the wisdom of the requirement of a finding of fitness contained in section 667(d)(3)(C). That would be impermissible. But, contrary to the majority (maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 1102), we can surely conclude that it is not \u201cirrational.\u201d For we may deem it a kind of screening device, separating classes of juveniles\u2014those as to whom a doubt about fitness had been raised (albeit subsequently resolved), and those as to whom such a doubt had not.</p>\n<p id=\"b1145-5\">On the merits, the majority\u2019s argument conjectures, and complains, that the requirement of a finding of fitness contained in section 667(d)(3)(C) might \u201cseverely limit\u201d the substantive scope of possible strikes for prior juvenile adjudications against the Legislature\u2019s expressed intent. Its conjecture is without basis: it provides no numbers, hard or soft. Its complaint is similar: it ignores that the intent is \u201cto ensure longer prison sentences and greater punishment\u201d <em>for certain recidivists under certain conditions </em>(Pen. Code, \u00a7 667, subd. (b))\u2014including those with at least one prior juvenile adjudication with a finding of fitness, and excluding those with such an adjudication but without such a finding. Moreover, a limitation, even a severe limitation, of the sort referred to might not be out of place. The substantive scope of possible strikes for prior juvenile adjudications is broader than that for prior felony convictions properly so called. The latter comprises \u201cviolent\u201d and \u201cserious\u201d California felonies and certain out-of-state felonies. The former, by contrast, embraces those same felonies and also reaches beyond to Welfare and Institutions Code section 707(b) offenses, which cover such otherwise uncovered crimes as bribery of a witness (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 707, subd. (b)(19)). Consequently, some offenses committed by a juvenile are possible strikes, but the same ones committed by an adult are not. Such a result is harsh and hard to justify. A limitation like that referred to might have a mitigating effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b1145-6\">The majority also attempt to justify their removal of the requirement of a finding of fitness contained in section 667(d)(3)(C) by arguing that the retention of such a requirement \u201cwould evoke questions regarding . . . constitutional validity.\u201d (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 1102.) Here too, they fail to persuade.</p>\n<p id=\"b1145-7\">In one sense, the majority\u2019s argument is too early. Questions regarding the constitutional validity of the requirement of a finding of fitness contained in section 667(d)(3)(C) have not yet been squarely raised. Answers may therefore be left to another day. As stated, such a requirement is not irrational, functioning as it does as a kind of screening device, separating out those juveniles as to whom a doubt about fitness had been raised. If the juvenile himself was the source of the doubt, there is no ground for concern: He made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1108\">*1108</page-number>an admission. If the juvenile court was the source, the matter is not much different: It must be presumed to have acted on a factual basis. Even if the source was the prosecutor, the same is true: he must enjoy the same presumption. (Cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Wheeler </em>(1978) 22 Cal.3d 258, 278 [148 Cal.Rptr. 890, 583 P.2d 748] [holding that \u201cin any given instance the presumption must be that a [prosecutor] exercising a peremptory challenge is doing so on a constitutionally permissible ground\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1146-5\">In another sense, the majority\u2019s argument is too late. Here, the People have declared that the Three Strikes law in its entirety is \u201cpoorly drafted.\u201d Concerns like theirs should have been addressed to the Legislature, as it was considering whether to include a requirement of a finding of fitness. They are now out of time, the Legislature having already included such a requirement in section 667(d)(3)(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b1146-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b1146-7\">For the reasons stated above, I would reverse the Court of Appeal\u2019s judgment to the extent that it reverses the superior court\u2019s order striking the prior juvenile adjudication allegation as to assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b1146-8\">Werdegar, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1141-15\"> The initiative version of the Three Strikes law (Prop. 184, \u00a7 1, as approved by voters, Gen.

An express finding\u2014contained in a declaration such as \u201cthe juvenile is in fact fit\u201d\u2014leaves nothing to be desired. An implied finding\u2014inferable, for example, from a refusal to transfer the proceeding to criminal court after conclusion of a hearing on fitness\u2014is sufficient.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1144-9\"> The majority construe section 667(d)(3)(C) away assertedly in order to avoid making (d)(3)(A) \u201credundant\u201d: at the time of the Three Strikes law, the juvenile court could make a finding of fitness only as to a juvenile who was at least 16 years old when he committed the offense resulting in the prior juvenile adjudication. (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 1102.) But at that time, as Justice Kennard explains in her dissenting opinion, it was about to be given the power to make such a finding as to a juvenile as young as 14 years old. (Dis. opn. of Kennard, J., <em>post, </em>at p. 1114.) Section 667(d)(3)(A) must therefore be considered anticipatory. It cannot be deemed \u201credundant.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b1146-9\">KENNARD, J., Dissenting.</author>\n<p id=\"A7Y\">The \u201cThree Strikes\u201d law (Pen. Code, \u00a7 667, subds. (b)-(i))<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> provides that a juvenile adjudication is a \u201cstrike\u201d only if, during the proceedings leading to the adjudication, the juvenile \u201cwas found to be a fit and proper subject to be dealt with under the juvenile court law.\u201d (\u00a7 667, subd. (d)(3)(C).) Such a finding is made at a hearing under Welfare and Institutions Code section 707, when the juvenile court, in considering a request by the prosecutor that the juvenile be tried as an adult, determines that the juvenile is \u201ca fit and proper subject to be dealt with under the juvenile court law.\u201d (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 707, subd. (c).) Thus, in my view, a juvenile adjudication is not a \u201cstrike\u201d unless, during the proceedings leading to the adjudication, the court made a finding of \u201cfitness\u201d under section 707 of the Welfare and Institutions Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b1146-10\">In this case, the prosecution alleged two prior juvenile adjudications as \u201cstrikes.\u201d Neither of these adjudications resulted from proceedings in which the prosecutor asked that the minor be tried as an adult; thus, in neither proceeding did the juvenile court find that the minor was \u201ca fit and proper subject to be dealt with under the juvenile court law,\u201d as required by the Three Strikes law. Nevertheless, the majority holds that each adjudication is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1109\">*1109</page-number>a \u201cstrike.\u201d It reaches this result by ignoring the plain meaning of section 667, subdivision (d)(3)(C), as well as established rules of statutory construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1147-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1147-5\">Defendant was charged with murder (\u00a7 187) and attempted murder (\u00a7\u00a7 187/664). Also alleged were three prior \u201cstrikes\u201d under the Three Strikes law: an adult conviction for robbery (\u00a7 211), and juvenile adjudications for residential burglary (\u00a7 459) and felonious assault (\u00a7 245). Defendant moved to have the juvenile adjudications stricken on a variety of grounds, one of which was that in neither juvenile adjudication did the trial court make a finding that defendant was \u201ca fit and proper subject to be dealt with under the juvenile court law.\u201d (\u00a7 667, subd. (d)(3)(C).) The prosecution conceded that no such finding of fitness appeared on the record of either case, but argued that such a finding is \u201cinherent\u201d in <em>every </em>juvenile case in which the juvenile court finds true the allegations of a delinquency petition, and the minor is either adjudged or continues to be a ward of the court. The trial court granted defendant\u2019s motion, ordering the adjudications stricken. The prosecution appealed. The Court of Appeal held that a juvenile adjudication may be a \u201cstrike\u201d even if the juvenile court made no explicit finding that the minor was fit to be dealt with under juvenile court law. This court granted review.</p>\n<p id=\"b1147-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1147-7\">Under the Three Strikes law, three types of qualifying offenses may be considered as \u201cstrikes\u201d: (1) an adult conviction for a California crime listed in section 667.5, subdivision (c) as a violent felony, or listed in section 1192.7, subdivision (c) as a serious felony; (2) an adult conviction for a crime that was committed outside of California and includes all the elements of a crime listed under our state statutes as a violent or serious felony, and (3) certain prior juvenile adjudications. (\u00a7 667, subd. (d).) The third category is at issue here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1147-8\">Under section 667, subdivision (d)(3), a juvenile adjudication must satisfy four criteria to qualify as a strike: \u201cA prior juvenile adjudication shall constitute a prior felony conviction for purposes of sentence enhancement if: [ID (A) The juvenile was 16 years of age or older at the time he or she committed the prior offense. [&lt;fl] (B) The prior offense is listed in subdivision (b) of Section 707 of the Welfare and Institutions Code or described in paragraph (1) [California convictions for serious or violent felonies] or (2) [out-of-state convictions for serious or violent felonies] as a felony. [&lt;]D (C) <em>The juvenile was found to be a fit and proper subject to be dealt with </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1110\">*1110</page-number><em>under the juvenile court law. </em>[f] (D) The juvenile was adjudged a ward of the juvenile court within the meaning of Section 602 of the Welfare and Institutions Code because the person committed an offense listed in subdivision (b) of Section 707 of the Welfare and Institutions Code.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1148-5\">What did the Legislature mean when it required that, to qualify as a \u201cstrike,\u201d the adjudication be one in which \u201cthe juvenile was found to be a fit and proper subject to be dealt with under the juvenile court law?\u201d As I stated at the outset, such a finding is made only at a so-called \u201cfitness\u201d hearing under Welfare and Institutions Code section 707. Subdivision (c) of that statute authorizes the prosecutor in any juvenile delinquency matter to request a hearing to determine whether the minor is \u201ca fit and proper subject to be dealt with under the juvenile court law.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> If, at the hearing, the juvenile court makes a finding of unfitness, the pending charge is, as a general rule, transferred to adult court, and the minor is tried as an adult for the offense charged. (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 707.01.) If, on the other hand, the juvenile court finds the minor fit to be dealt with under juvenile court law, the charges are disposed of in juvenile court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1148-6\">When the Legislature drafted the juvenile \u201cstrike\u201d provision embodied in subdivision (d)(3)(C) of section 667, it used the identical words\u2014\u201ca fit and proper subject to be dealt with under the juvenile court law\u201d\u2014as in Welfare and Institutions Code section 707, describing the finding that the juvenile court must make at a fitness hearing. This creates a strong inference of the Legislature\u2019s intent, in subdivision (d)(3)(C), to have qualify as \u201cstrikes\u201d only those juvenile adjudications arising from proceedings in which the juvenile court, after conducting a fitness hearing under Welfare and Institutions Code section 707, found the minor to be \u201ca fit and proper subject to be dealt with under the juvenile court law.\u201d (\u00a7 707, subd. (c).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1148-7\">I find additional support for this conclusion in the Legislature\u2019s express reference to Welfare and Institutions Code section 707 in the \u201cstrike\u201d provisions in Penal Code section 667 immediately before and after subdivision (d)(3)(C). Thus, subdivision (d)(3)(B) of section 667 provides that to qualify as a \u201cstrike,\u201d the juvenile adjudication must be one of the offenses \u201clisted in subdivision (b) of Section 707 of the Welfare and Institutions Code,\u201d or it must be listed elsewhere as a violent or serious felony. Similarly, under subdivision (d)(3)(D) of Penal Code section 667, a juvenile <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1111\">*1111</page-number>adjudication is a \u201cstrike\u201d only if the juvenile \u201cwas adjudged a ward of the juvenile court . . . [for committing] an offense listed in subdivision (b) of Section 707 of the Welfare and Institutions Code.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1149-5\">Some 16-year-old delinquents are already dangerous, violent criminals. But there may be others whose acts reflect youthful immaturity rather than a commitment to crime. Perhaps it was a concern not to subject juvenile offenders in the latter category to the harsh penalties of the new Three Strikes law that led the Legislature, which had never before permitted juvenile adjudications to be used in adult court for purposes of enhancement, to include within the class of \u201cstrikes\" only those crimes that, in the prosecutor\u2019s view, were so serious as to require trying the minor as an adult.</p>\n<p id=\"b1149-6\">According to the majority, a juvenile adjudication is a \u201cstrike\u201d regardless of whether the prosecutor had sought a fitness hearing under Welfare and Institutions Code section 707. In the majority\u2019s view, an \u201cimplied\u201d finding that the minor is \u201ca fit and proper subject to be dealt with under the juvenile court law\u201d is inherent in <em>every </em>juvenile adjudication, and therefore <em>all </em>juvenile adjudications that meet the criteria listed in subparts (A), (B), and (D) of Penal Code section 667, subdivision (d)(3) are \u201cstrikes.\u201d Not only does the majority\u2019s holding fly in the face of the language of section 667, subdivision (d)(3)(C), which says nothing about \u201cimplied\u201d findings, but it also renders that subdivision utterly meaningless. As I noted earlier, subdivision (d)(3) sets forth\u2014in subparts (A), (B), (C), and (D)\u2014four criteria that describe which juvenile adjudications can qualify as \u201cstrikes.\u201d If subdivision (d)(3)(C)\u2019s criterion is satisfied in <em>every </em>juvenile adjudication, then the provision serves no purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b1149-7\">In construing subdivision (d)(3)(C) of section 667 as having no effect, the majority has disregarded a cardinal rule of statutory construction, that courts should avoid a construction that makes some words surplusage. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Gilbert </em>(1969) 1 Cal.3d 475, 480 [82 Cal.Rptr. 724, 462 P.2d 580].) Here, the majority has not merely made surplusage out of a few words, but has construed an entire subdivision out of existence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1149-8\">The majority insists that under its construction, section 667, subdivision (d)(3)(C)\u2019s requirement that there be \u201ca determination that the minor is a fit and proper subject to be dealt with under the juvenile court law\u201d is not surplusage because it \u201chelps distinguish those offenses committed by minors 16 or over that are adjudicated in juvenile court rather than as adult offenses.\u201d (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 1102.) The majority does not explain, however, how the requirement in question \u201chelps\u201d in making this distinction. In any event, as I shall show, the majority is simply wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"Ali\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1112\">*1112</page-number>Section 667, subdivision (d)(3) begins by stating that a \u201cprior <em>juvenile adjudication </em>shall constitute a prior felony conviction for purposes of enhancement\u201d if it meets the four criteria I mentioned earlier. (Italics added.) Thus, subdivision (d)(3), in the words of the majority, \u201clists the requirements for a prior <em>juvenile adjudication </em>to qualify as a \u2018strike.\u2019 \u201d (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 1100, italics added.) By definition, a juvenile adjudication can occur only in juvenile court. Therefore, contrary to the majority\u2019s bare assertion, subdivision (d)(3)(C) cannot possibly \u201chelp\u201d in distinguishing between those offenses that are covered by subdivision (d)(3) and are adjudicated in juvenile court from those that are adjudicated as \u201cadult offenses,\u201d for <em>none </em>of the offenses covered in subdivision (d)(3) are adjudicated as adult offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b1150-5\">The majority offers three justifications for its construction of section 667, subdivision (d)(3)(C). None is persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b1150-6\">First, according to the majority, to require an express finding of fitness \u201cwould so severely limit those juvenile adjudications that would qualify as \u2018strikes,\u2019 that such a result would seem to be at odds with the <em>intent </em>of section 667, subdivisions (b)-(i).\u201d (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 1102, italics added.) What intent? The majority offers no explanation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1150-7\">Once again, the majority\u2019s assertion ignores a principle of statutory construction. Ordinarily, a reviewing court looks to the language of the statute to ascertain the Legislature\u2019s intent in enacting it. <em>(Freedom Newspapers, Inc. </em>v. <em>Orange County Employees Retirement System </em>(1993) 6 Cal.4th 821, 826 [25 Cal.Rptr.2d 148, 863 P.2d 218].) When the statutory language is ambiguous, we may examine the goals to be achieved and the legislative history to assist us in resolving the ambiguity. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Coronado </em>(1995) 12 Cal.4th 145, 151 [48 Cal.Rptr.2d 77, 906 P.2d 1232].) Here, the language of section 667, subdivision (d)(3)(C) is unambiguous: Juvenile adjudications qualify as \u201cstrikes\u201d only if there has been a determination that the minor is \u201ca fit and proper subject to be dealt with under the juvenile court law.\u201d But even if this language were considered ambiguous, the majority does not mention anything in the legislative history of section 667 that would suggest that the conclusion I draw from the statutory language\u2014that the trial court must find the minor a fit subject to be dealt with under juvenile court law at a hearing under Welfare and Institutions Code section 707\u2014is not the correct one.</p>\n<p id=\"b1150-8\">The only declaration of legislative intent pertaining to the entire Three Strikes statutory scheme appears in section 667, subdivision (b), which states: \u201cIt is the intent of the Legislature in enacting subdivisions (b) through <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1113\">*1113</page-number>(i), inclusive, to ensure longer prison sentences and greater punishment for those who commit a felony and have been previously <em>convicted </em>of serious and/or violent felony offenses.\u201d (Italics added.) But this is of no help in construing subdivision (d)(3)(C) of section 667, for it refers only to persons previously \u201cconvicted\u201d of violent or serious felonies. Ordinarily, juvenile adjudications are not convictions. While section 667, subdivision (d)(3) treats <em>some </em>juvenile adjudications as adult felony convictions and therefore as \u201cstrikes\u201d for purposes of the Three Strikes law, in this case the issue is <em>which </em>adjudications the Legislature intended to treat in this fashion. As to this issue, the declaration of legislative intent in subdivision (b) of section 667 offers no assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b1151-5\">Next, the majority says a rule that only juvenile adjudications accompanied by a finding of fitness could qualify as \u201cstrikes,\u201d as I am proposing, \u201cwould evoke questions regarding the statute\u2019s constitutional validity,\u201d because an increase in punishment \u201cwould depend solely on an <em>unsuccessful </em>motion for a determination that the minor is unfit for treatment in the juvenile court system.\u201d (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 1102, original italics.) This statement is misleading. For an offense committed by a juvenile to be a strike, the prosecution need not make an <em>unsuccessful </em>motion to try the juvenile as an adult, because the offense will be a \u201cstrike\u201d whether or not the motion succeeds. If the trial court grants the motion, the offense will be adjudicated in adult court, and if the minor is found guilty, the offense will qualify as a strike. If, however, the court denies the motion, the offense will be adjudicated in juvenile court, and if the minor is found to have committed the crime it will still qualify as a strike. In short, whether a criminal act by a juvenile is a \u201cstrike\u201d does not turn on whether the prosecution is <em>successful </em>in its attempt to have the minor tried as an adult; rather, it turns on whether the prosecutor considers the crime so serious as to make the attempt in the first place.</p>\n<p id=\"b1151-6\">The majority\u2019s perceived shortcoming of such a rule is that it \u201cwould arguably be open to a variety of constitutional challenges such as equal protection, due process, and separation of powers.\u201d (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 1102.) The majority cites no authority for this bare assertion. Moreover, because defendant has not attacked the constitutionality of the Three Strikes law, this issue is not present here. In any event, the majority\u2019s resort to the rule of construction that ambiguous statutes should be construed in a manner that will avoid doubts about their constitutionality is of no avail. For this rule to apply, \u201cthe statute must be <em>realistically </em>susceptible of two interpretations . . . .\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Anderson </em>(1987) 43 Cal.3d 1104, 1146 [240 Cal.Rptr. 585, 742 P.2d 1306], original italics.) Here, as I have shown, the statutory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1114\">*1114</page-number>language is unambiguous. Therefore, it may not <em>realistically </em>be construed to abrogate the requirement that the minor be found, at a fitness hearing under Welfare and Institutions Code section 707, to be \u201ca fit and proper subject to be dealt with under the juvenile court law.\u201d (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 707, subd. (c).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1152-5\">Finally the majority, apparently conceding that its construction of section 667, subdivision (d)(3)(C) renders this provision superfluous, asserts that to construe this provision as requiring an express finding of fitness by the juvenile court could \u201carguably\u201d render superfluous subdivision (d)(3)(A) of section 667. Thus, according to the majority, either way section 667, subdivision (d)(3) is construed, part of it is superfluous.</p>\n<p id=\"b1152-6\">Under subdivision (d)(3)(A) of section 667, juvenile adjudications qualify as \u201cstrikes\u201d if the juvenile \u201cwas 16 years of age or older at the time he or she committed the prior offense.\u201d When the Legislature enacted the Three Strikes law, juveniles under the age of 16 could not be tried as adults. Therefore, the majority reasons, if the Legislature intended section 667, subdivision (d)(3)(C) to require an express finding of fitness, there was no need for it to enact subdivision (d)(3)(A), because minors over the age of 16 were the only ones who could be found unfit to be tried in juvenile court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1152-7\">This argument has superficial appeal, but on careful examination it proves unpersuasive. True, when the Three Strikes law was enacted in March 1994, minors under the age of 16 could not be tried as adults. But that was changed six months later, when the Legislature amended Welfare and Institutions Code section 707 to permit minors as young as 14 to be tried as an adults. Assembly Bill No. 560,1993-1994 Regular Session, which proposed amending section 707, was introduced in February 1993, and had been pending for over a year when the Legislature enacted the Three Strikes law in March 1994. Thus the Legislature knew, when it enacted the Three Strikes law, that it was on the verge of enacting legislation that would make Penal Code section 667, subdivision (d)(3)(A) <em>not </em>superfluous. It is reasonable to assume that the Legislature anticipated the passage of that legislation when it chose to include subdivision (d)(3)(A) in the Three Strikes law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1152-8\">The majority\u2019s holding also violates the time-honored rule that \u201cambiguous penal statutes are construed to favor the defendant.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Superior Court (Romero) </em>(1996) 13 Cal.4th 497, 530 [53 Cal.Rptr.2d 789, 917 P.2d 628].) As this court said 107 years ago, \u201cthe defendant [in a criminal case] is entitled to the benefit of every reasonable doubt. . . as to the true interpretation of words or the construction of language used in a statute . . . .\u201d <em>(Ex parte Rosenheim </em>(1890) 83 Cal. 388, 391 [23 P. 372].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1153-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1115\">*1115</page-number>Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b1153-5\">We are all concerned about the epidemic of violent crime in our society. The Three Strikes law that the Legislature enacted in March 1994 and that we construe today (\u00a7 667, subds. (b)-(i)) reflects a toughening public attitude towards repeat offenders. That attitude is also reflected in the nearly identical Three Strikes initiative that was overwhelmingly passed by the voters just eight months later. (\u00a7 1170.12.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1153-6\">A court construing a statute, however, can never be guided by public sentiment alone. Here, in construing the Three Strikes law, it is not enough to say that because the Legislature and the electorate wished to impose tougher penalties on repeat violent offenders, we should therefore give that enactment the harshest possible construction. Judges are constrained by the law. For the sake of the predictability and stability of the law, our guideposts in interpreting the Three Strikes law must be the usual principles of statutory construction that apply in every case, not our projections of the hopes and fears that led to the statute\u2019s enactment. In the words of United States Supreme Court Justice Felix Frankfurter: \u201cFor judicial construction to stick close to what the legislation says and not draw prodigally upon unformulated purposes or directions makes for careful draftsmanship and for legislative responsibility. . . . Judicial expansion of meaning beyond the limits indicated is reprehensible because it encourages slipshodness in draftsmanship and irresponsibility in legislation. It also enlists too heavily the private . . . views of judges.\u201d (Frankfurter, <em>Foreword, </em>Symposium on Statutory Construction (1950) 3 Vand. L.Rev. 365, 367-368.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1153-7\">As the Contra Costa District Attorney said in a superior court brief he filed in this case, \u201c \u2018Three Strikes\u2019 is a poorly drafted statute.\u201d Many of its provisions are contradictory or lack clarity. But the provision we construe today, subdivision (d)(3)(C) of section 667, is among the clearer ones in the Three Strikes law. As I have explained, application of well-established rules of construction here compels the conclusion that under subdivision (d)(3)(C), a juvenile adjudication is a \u201cstrike\u201d only if the juvenile court has made the finding that the minor is \u201ca fit and proper subject to be treated under the juvenile court law.\u201d In coming to a contrary conclusion, the majority ignores these principles. The majority achieves its result of increasing the number of juvenile adjudications that will count as \u201cstrikes\u201d only at the cost of effectively throwing out subdivision (d)(3)(C) from the Three Strikes law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1154-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1116\">*1116</page-number>I would reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1154-5\">Werdegar, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b1154-6\">Respondent\u2019s petition for a rehearing was denied August 27, 1997.
