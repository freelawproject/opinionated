(Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 211, 664, &amp; former \u00a7 212.5, subd. (b), as added by Stats. 1986, ch. 1428, \u00a7 2, p. 5123.) He was prosecuted under the three strikes law codified at Penal Code section 667.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As required by subdivision (c) of section 667, the prosecution \u201cpled and proved\u201d that he had \u201cone or more prior felony convictions as defined in subdivision (d)\u201d\u2014namely, a prior conviction for a 1993 robbery, a serious felony (\u00a7 1192.7, subd. (c)(19)). He was on probation for the 1993 offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">The trial court sentenced McMillan (hereafter defendant) to the middle term of two years\u2019 imprisonment for the attempted second degree robbery. (\u00a7 18; former \u00a7 213, subd. (b), as added by Stats. 1986, ch. 1428, \u00a7 4, p. 5124.) The court doubled the term to four years because this current felony conviction was defendant\u2019s \u201csecond strike\u201d\u2014i.e., the prosecution had \u201cpled and proved\u201d (\u00a7 667, subd. (e)(1)) that he had a prior conviction for a serious or violent felony (see <em>id.., </em>subd. (d)(1)), namely the 1993 robbery. Because his current offense was a serious felony (\u00a7 1192.7, subd. (c)(19); see <em>id., </em>foil, subd. (c)(27)), the court also added a five-year enhancement (\u00a7 667, subd. (a)(1)) for having committed the 1993 robbery, which, as stated, also was a serious felony. The result was a determinate sentence of nine years for defendant\u2019s current conviction. The court also found him in violation of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>grant of probation for the 1993 robbery and revoked the same, imposing a three-year prison term to be served concurrently with the nine-year term for the current offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">The Court of Appeal affirmed the judgment, but modified it to require that the term for the 1993 robbery conviction be served consecutively as a subordinate term to the nine-year term for the 1994 attempted robbery. Relying on <em>People </em>v. <em>Scott </em>(1994) 9 Cal.4th 331, 354 [36 Cal.Rptr.2d 627, 885 P.2d 1040], it concluded that the trial court\u2019s concurrent sentence was \u201clegally unauthorized\u201d and modifiable on appeal even if not contested in the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">To reach the conclusion that the sentence was unlawful, the Court of Appeal reasoned: \u201cWhen sentenced on November 22, 1994, in the present case, defendant also received a three-year concurrent term for his probation violation for the robbery in [1993]. In other words, the probation violation <em>sentence </em>ran [concurrently with defendant\u2019s new case which is the subject of the present appeal. [\u00b6 . . . Defendant, who falls within the habitual offender provisions of section 667, subdivision (e), stands convicted of two serious felonies, robberies, and is presently subject to concurrent sentences. This is a legally unauthorized sentence because defendant must be sentenced consecutively pursuant to section 667, subdivision (c)(7).\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">Defendant contends \u201c[i]n holding that the trial court was under a duty ... to impose consecutive sentences for [the] current offense and in the probation violation matter, the Court of Appeal [erroneously] characterized the conviction in the probation violation matter as a \u2018current conviction.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b245-8\">Because the legality of defendant\u2019s sentence is a purely legal matter, we review its propriety de novo. Under that standard, we find defendant\u2019s point well taken: by equating the imposition of <em>sentence </em>following his probation violation with a current <em>conviction, </em>the Court of Appeal erred.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-9\">The sole basis for the Court of Appeal\u2019s reversal of the trial court\u2019s imposition of concurrent sentences was the reviewing court\u2019s conclusion that section 667, subdivision (c)(7), required consecutive sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-10\">As far as the consequences of defendant\u2019s recidivism are concerned, the trial court properly calculated and determined his sentence. He was convicted of attempted second degree robbery, a serious felony, in the present <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>proceeding. The prosecution had established by pleading and proof that he had \u201ca prior conviction of a felony\u201d (\u00a7 667, subd. (d)), \u201cdefined in subdivision (c) of Section 1192.7 as a serious felony in this state\u201d <em>(id., </em>subd. (d)(1)). The fact that he was on probation for the prior offense was immaterial. (\u00a7 667, subd. (d)(1)(A); see \u00a7 1203, subd. (a) [\u201cAs used in this code, \u2018probation\u2019 means the suspension of the imposition or execution of a sentence and the order of conditional and revocable release in the community under the supervision of a probation officer.\u201d].) But defendant did not suffer \u201ca current conviction for more than one felony count\u201d (\u00a7 667, subd. (c)(6)) or \u201cfor more than one serious or violent felony as described in paragraph (6)\u201d <em>(id., </em>subd. (c)(7))\u2014in fact the prosecution\u2019s pleading and proof established the fact of a prior conviction. <em>People </em>v. <em>Williams </em>(1996) 49 Cal.App.4th 1632 [57 Cal.Rptr.2d 448], held that under the three strikes law \u201cwhen guilt is established, either by plea or verdict, the defendant stands convicted and thereafter has a prior conviction.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1638.) In light of the prosecution\u2019s proof of a prior conviction, we need not embark on an exhaustive review of the conclusion reached in <em>Williams </em>to conclude that the People have not shown defendant was convicted of his 1993 offense in the present proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\">Conceding that subdivision (c)(7) of section 667 does not apply, the People contend instead that defendant is subject to consecutive sentencing under subdivision (c)(8) of section 667. We disagree: he was not \u201calready serving\u201d \u201cany other sentence\u201d when \u201csentence [was] imposed pursuant to subdivision (e)\u201d of section 667. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">In support of their view that subdivision (c)(8) of section 667 requires a consecutive sentence to be imposed, the People assert that as long as defendant has been granted a term of probation and that term has not expired, he is \u201cserving\u201d another \u201csentence.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>They rely on rule 405(f) of the California Rules of Court. That rule provides: \u201c \u2018Sentence choice\u2019 means the selection of any disposition of the case which does not amount to a dismissal, acquittal, or grant of a new trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">We are not persuaded. A court rule is without effect to the extent it is \u201cinconsistent with statute.\u201d (Cal. Const., art. VI, \u00a7 6, 4th par.; <em>People </em>v. <em>Hall </em>(1994) 8 Cal.4th 950, 960 [35 Cal.Rptr.2d 432, 883 P.2d 974].) The Legislature has treated the concepts of sentence and probation differently. It has done so in the three strikes law: section 667, subdivision (c)(2), specifies that when the defendant is sentenced for a second or third strike, \u201c [probation for the current offense shall not be granted, nor shall execution or imposition of the sentence be suspended for any prior offense.\u201d It has done <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>so in section 1203, subdivision (a), quoted <em>ante, </em>and in sections 1170, subdivision (a)(3), 1203a, and 1203.2, subdivision (c). No matter whether sentence was originally imposed or suspended, it does not begin to be served following probation revocation until the offender is \u201cdelivered over to the proper officer\u201d (\u00a7 1203.2, subd. (c); see <em>Stephens </em>v. <em>Toomey </em>(1959) 51 Cal.2d 864, 874 [338 P.2d 182].) In this case, defendant did not begin to serve his sentence before he was committed to the sheriff\u2019s custody (\u00a7\u00a7 1215, 1216; see <em>People </em>v. <em>Karaman </em>(1992) 4 Cal.4th 335, 345-346 [14 Cal.Rptr.2d 801, 842 P.2d 100]), and likely not until the sheriff delivered him to prison (\u00a7\u00a7 1216, 2900, subds. (a), (c)). We need not dwell further on this technical point, however\u2014it suffices to say that, being on probation, defendant was not already serving his sentence for purposes of section 667, subdivision (c)(8).</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">We address two other points. First, the People contend, as outlined during oral argument, that it would be arbitrary for a sentence\u2019s length to depend on the sequence of procedure\u2014i.e., the sentence would be longer if, unlike here, a court first imposed a sentence to prison for violating probation and thereafter it or another court imposed a prison term under section 667, subdivision (e). In that case, subdivision (c)(8) of section 667 might require consecutive sentencing. We share the People\u2019s implicit concern about races to the courthouse, and we note generally the sense of \u201c \u2018frustration\u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Winslow </em>(1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 680, 684, fn. 1 [46 Cal.Rptr.2d 901]) that our sentencing laws\u2019 \u201c \u2018labyrinthine formalism\u2019 \u201d <em>(ibid.) </em>and \u201cbewildering . . . complexity\u201d <em>(ibid.) </em>have furrowed into the psyche of trial courts, counsel, and defendants, but we must follow the statutory mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">Citing subdivision (c) of section 1170.1, the People also contend that \u201c[o]ffenses committed while a defendant is in prison are already fully consecutive to the sentence for the offense for which the defendant was in prison. . . . Thus if subdivision (c)(8) [of section 667] were intended to apply only to those situations, the statute would in effect be nothing but surplusage.\u201d But this characterization is inaccurate. Subdivision (c)(8) of section 667 is not limited to in-prison offenses, and section 1170.1, subdivision (c), does not direct that all in-prison offenses must be punished by consecutive sentences. Rather, it provides that if a consecutive sentence is imposed for such an offense, the term runs from the time the defendant otherwise would have been released from prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">We reverse the Court of Appeal\u2019s judgment insofar as it orders defendant\u2019s sentences to run consecutively and that the trial court so direct. In all other respects, we affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>George, C.
