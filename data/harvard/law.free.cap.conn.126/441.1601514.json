Claims for benefits are required (a) to be made at the public employment bureau most easily accessible, (b) An examiner designated by the administrator, \u00a7 1340e(a), is required to examine the claim and, on the basis of the facts found by him, determine whether the claim is valid. From his decision appeal may be taken as therein provided, (c) On this appeal the claim is heard, de novo, by one of the commissioners appointed under \u00a7 1340e(b). Benefit eligibility conditions are prescribed by \u00a7 1339e. The qualifications (a) include that an unemployed individual (1) shall be found to have made claim for benefits and \u201cregistered for work\u201d at the public employment bureau or other agency designated by the administrator and (2) that \u201che is physically and mentally able to work and is available for work.\u201d The disqualifications (b) include cases in which the administrator finds that the claimant \u201chas failed without sufficient cause either to apply for available, suitable work when directed so to do by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>the public employment bureau or the administrator; or to accept suitable work when offered him by [such] bureau or by an employer.\u201d It is further provided that in determining whether or not any work is suitable to an individual the administrator may consider (inter alia) \u201cthe degree of risk involved to his health, safety and morals, his physical fitness and prior training and experience.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">Glenna Stella, hereinafter called the plaintiff, obtained employment with the named defendant in July, 1937, working at a soda fountain in its restaurant. In March, 1939, she terminated her employment to get married and did so in May. On September 20, 1939, she made claim for unemployment benefits but the examiner denied it on the ground that she was not \u201cavailable for work\u201d as required by \u00a7 1339e, supra. She appealed and, after hearing, the commissioner for the first district reversed the examiner\u2019s decision. From this the administrator appealed to the Superior Court, which dismissed the appeal to it. The issue upon all the appeals, including that to this court, is whether, upon the facts, the plaintiff is \u201cavailable for work\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 1339e(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b457-7\">The commissioner found that during the plaintiff\u2019s last four months of employment she worked as a waitress in the defendant\u2019s establishment because she felt that if she did not she would be discharged. Recourse to her original registration card shows a notation \u201cdoes not like waiting work\u201d and the commissioner\u2019s finding states that \u201cshe does not care to accept a job as a waitress\u201d because she feels that her high school education, which included commercial subjects, fits her for other types of employment than as waitress; that she is capable of clerical work in offices and would be glad to be offered a position on a drug store or other sales counter; that she is physically and mentally able <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>and is willing to accept any such work; and concluded that she is available for work within the meaning of the statute. The Superior Court on the appeal to it construed the commissioner\u2019s finding as being that the plaintiff \u201cwas unwilling to include in the work which she registered to do that incidental to the position of a waitress.\u201d Respecting the commissioner\u2019s conclusion it held that it was within the latitude accorded under the statute and not to be disturbed on appeal. The administrator\u2019s claim is that \u201cany kind of work in which a person has had prior training and experience without any ill effect upon his or her health, safety and morals is suitable,\u201d that to qualify for benefits he must register for all such work, and that the plaintiff \u201chaving excluded waitress work\u201d has not fulfilled the requirement of being \u201cavailable for work.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">We do not construe either the registration of the plaintiff or her subsequent attitude as definitely excluding waitress work, as the commissioner appears to have done. Certainly the declaration in her registration that she \u201cdoes not like\u201d that work does not amount to refusal to accept it, nor does the finding, or the evidence before the commissioner, that she does not \u201ccare to\u201d work as a waitress. \u201cCare\u201d means only \u201cto have an inclination, wish, or disposition.\u201d Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary, 2d Ed. Therefore this case does not involve determination whether a claimant who in registering definitely excluded work which the administrator held to be suitable would thereby become disqualified for benefits. We observe, however, that all the statute \u2014 \u00a7 1339e(a)(2) \u2014 appears to require in the first instance is that the claimant be \u201cavailable for work,\u201d so that, it would seem, ineligibility for benefits because of exclusion, by a claimant, of any certain class or kind of employment would arise <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>through failure to apply for, when directed, or accept when offered, work determined by the administrator to be suitable for the individual, as provided in \u00a7 1339e(b). It does not appear that this plaintiff has been directed to apply for or been offered employment as a waitress or in any other capacity. If she should be offered and refuse employment as a waitress, and the administrator ruled it to be suitable, determination as to the effect of such refusal, including the validity of the ruling, would be appropriate. We are unable on the present appeal to find ground for error in the decision of the Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">There is no error. No costs will be taxed in this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
