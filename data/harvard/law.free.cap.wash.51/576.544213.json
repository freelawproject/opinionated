The relator alleges, that the respondent was elected to the office of lieutenant governor at the general election held in November, 1908; that the votes were canvassed by the legislature as required by law, and respondent was declared duly elected, and on the second Monday of January, 1909, he duly qualified and is now holding the said office; that the respondent is incompetent to qualify or hold that office by reason of the fact that, prior to the primary election held' on September 8, 1908, at which he was a candidate for the nomination of lieutenant governor on the republican ticket, he solicited and caused certain named newspapers to publish a statement consisting of the words \u201c \u2018Paid Advertisement,\u2019 followed by a photograph of said M. E. Hay, said photograph being followed by the words \u2018M. E. Play, candidate for the republican nomination for the office of lieutenant governor,\u2019 \u201d and promised and agreed to pay, and did pay, such newspapers for such publications.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">Respondent in opposing the writ presents several constitu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>tional questions, which need not be considered, in view of the construction which we place upon the statute relating to primary elections. Section 28 of the primary election law, Laws of 1907, page 472, upon which the relator relies, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-5\">\u201cNo person shall be' competent to qualify for any public office, who shall have, prior to the holding of any primary election, paid, or promised or agreed to pay, either directly or through another, or in any manner whatsoever, to the owner, publisher, manager or representative of any newspaper, any sum of money or other thing of value, for any article or published statement in a newspaper, wherein the electors are advised or counseled to vote for such candidate, or his fitness or qualifications for office are set forth, or his photograph or biography is published.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">The language here is somewhat involved, and is no doubt susceptible of the construction urged by the relator, to the effect that the mere- publication of a photograph with a statement telling whose .photograph it is disqualifies a candidate from holding office. It may also be construed as contended for by respondent, viz., as prohibiting payment for the-publication of \u201cAny article or published statement in a newspaper wherein the electors are advised - or counseled to vote for srfch candidate or his fitness of qualifications-for office are set forth, or his photograph or biography is published.\u201d In other words, the photograph must be published in connection with the <em>published article or statement </em>where the voters are advised to vote for such candidate or his fitness or qualification for office is set forth. We think this construction must be adopted. The mere statement whom the photograph represents is not such an article or statement as is prohibited by the provisions above named.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-7\">The penalty for violating this statute is severe. It should not attach unless the meaning of the language is plain and the violation is clear. The attorney general, whose duty it is to advise public officers, gave an opinion on April 18, 1908, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>construing the section of the primary law under consideration, in which opinion that officer said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-5\">\u201cThat payment of money to a newspaper in the manner and for the purpose specified above, to wit: Publication of announcement of candidacy (with or without accompanying photograph) over the signature of the candidate, but without newspaper comment, does not render that candidate incompetent for public office.\u201d Report Attorney General, 1908, p. 446, Opinion No. 343.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b628-7\">We do not cite this opinion as controlling upon this court, but merely to show that \u00a7 28 does not clearly make the publication of a photograph a disqualification for office. It also shows that the respondent acted in good faith. Under these conditions, where the statute is construed by an officer whose duty it is to advise public officers, and where persons advised or with knowledge of such advice follow the same, the statute should not be construed otherwise unless the language is clear and unambiguous. The following section of the statute, viz., \u00a7' 29, makes it a misdemeanor for any newspaper or other publication to accept money for advocating the election or defeat of any candidate, and then provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-8\">\u201cNothing herein shall prevent any person or persons, firm or corporation engaged in the publication of any newspaper, magazine or periodical from receiving for publication and publishing any matter, article or articles advocating the election or defeat of any candidate or candidates and receiving a consideration therefor, if such articles so published or printed have placed at the beginning thereof in plain type of black-faced Roman capitals in a conspicuous place, the statement \u2018Paid Advertisement.\u2019 But this section shall not be construed as permitting the payment for any publication prohibited by section 28 of this act.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b628-9\">The <em>word\u201cpublication\u201d </em>here used refers clearly to the words \u201carticle or published statement\u201d used in \u00a7 28. The object of \u00a7 29 is to prevent the newspapers named from advocating for secret hire the election or defeat of any candidate, but newspapers are authorized to openly sell their space where the readers are advised of the fact that the matter used is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>an advertisement merely. The last clause of \u00a7 29 makes it clear that candidates themselves may not advocate their own election in newspapers by articles or statements which advise voters to vote for them, or where such articles set out their qualifications for office. But we think these sections are not intended to disqualify a candidate who merely publishes his picture with the statement whom the picture represents.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">With this construction of the statute, it is unnecessary to consider the other questions presented. The writ must therefore be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">Crow, J., concurs.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b629-7\">Dunbar, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ApR\">(concurring) \u2014 I concur for the reason that the statute is so cloudy and its meaning so uncertain that I do not think it would be just to impose so severe a penalty as the loss of office upon one who might chance to misinterpret its provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-8\">Gose, J., concurs with Dunbar, J.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b629-9\">Rudkin, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"APT\">(dissenting) \u2014 I regret my inability to agree with the conclusion announced by the majority of the court in this case, and the importance of the questions involved calls for, or at least justifies, a brief statement of the reasons for my non-concurrence.- The opinions of the,majority are based upon the ground that the direct primary law, so-called, does not prohibit the acts committed by the respondent, and does not render him incompetent to qualify for the office to which he has been elected; or, more properly speaking perhaps, upon the ground that the language of the act is so obscure and cloudy and the penalty so severe that a court should not enforce the penalty which follows as a matter of course upon its violation. The only provisions of the act which have any special bearing upon the question under consideration are \u00a7\u00a7'28 and 29, which read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-10\">\u201cSec. 28. No person shall, in order to aid or promote his own nomination to a public office under the provisions of this act, or any amendment thereto, directly or indirectly, him<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>self or through another person, give, pay, expend or contribute, or promise to give, pay, expend or contribute any money or other valuable thing, except for personal expenses. The words \u2018personal expenses,\u2019 as used in this act, shall include only expenses directly incurred and paid by a candidate for traveling and for purposes properly incidental to traveling, and for writing, printing and perparing for transmission any letter, circular or other publication not issued at regular intervals, whereby he states his position or views upon public or other questions; for stationery and postage, for telegraph, telephone and public messenger service, and for other similar expenses, and for the necessary expense of hiring halls or other rooms for the purpose of holding meetings to address the voters and others upon public questions and matters relating to his candidacy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-5\">\u201cNo person shall be competent to qualify for any public office, who shall have, prior to the holding of any primary election, paid, or promised or agreed to pay, either directly or through another or in any manner whatsoever, to the owner, publisher, manager or representative of any newspaper, any sum of money or other thing of value, for any article or published statement in a newspaper wherein the electors are advised or counseled to vote for such candidate, or his fitness or qualifications for office are set forth, or his photograph or biography is published.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-6\">\u201cSec. 29. It shall be unlawful for any owner, proprietor, editor, manager, officer, clerk, agent, reporter, or employee of any newspaper,magazine or periodical printed or published in this state, to take, accept, or receive, or agree to take, accept or receive, for himself or any other person, or persons, firm or corporation, either by himself or any other person, persons, firm or corporation, any money, gratuity or other valuable consideration or article of value for or on account of or as a consideration for such newspaper, magazine or other periodical supporting or advocating the election or defeat of any candidate or candidates at any primary election. Any such owner, proprietor, editor, manager, officer, clerk, agent, reporter or employee of any newspaper, magazine or other periodical violating the provisions of this act shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor and shall be fined in any sum not less than $25 and not more than $500 or confined in the county jail not less than 10 days or more than six months or be pun<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>ished by both such fine and imprisonment: <em>Provided, however, </em>Nothing herein shall prevent any person or persons, firm or corporation engaged in the publication of any newspaper, magazine or periodical from receiving for publication and publishing any matter, article or articles advocating the election or defeat of any candidate or candidates and receiving a consideration therefor,-if such articles so published or printed have placed at the beginning thereof in plain type of black-faced Roman capitals in a conspicuous place, the statement \u2018PAID ADVERTISEMENT.\u2019 But this section shall not be, construed as permitting the payment for any publication prohibited by section twenty-eight of this act.\u201d Laws 1907, pp. 472, 473.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">The language of these sections may be somewhat involved, as suggested in the majority opinions, but when the act is read in its entirety and construed as a whole, its meaning is plain and obvious. Section 28 declares in express terms that no person shall be competent to qualify for a public office who shall have paid to the owner or publisher of a newspaper any sum of money for any article or published statement wherein his photograph or biography is published, and it is very apparent to my mind that a statement that the respondent was a candidate for the office of lieutenant governor on the republican ticket, accompanied by his photograph, is a published statement wherein his photograph is published, within the intent and meaning of the act. The majority say that the published article or statement must advise or counsel the electors to vote for the candidate, or set forth his fitness or qualifications for office, as well as publish his photograph or biography, before it comes within the prohibition of the statute; but this view is, in my opinion, manifestly erroneous, for at least two reasons. In the first place, the publication of an article or statement advising or counseling the electors to vote for a candidate, or setting forth his fitness or qualifications for office, without more, is a plain and palpable violation of the act and works a forfeiture of the office, and it would be an idle formality for the legislature to provide that such acts, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>when accompanied by the publication of the candidate\u2019s biography or photograph, would have the like but no greater effect. In the second place, to permit a candidate for office to pay for the publication of his photograph accompanied by a statement of the office to which he aspires, in a newspaper published at regular intervals, is in direct violation of the provision of the first part of \u00a7 28, which prohibits a candidate from paying or contributing money to promote his candidacy except for personal expenses, and defines \u201cpersonal expenses\u201d in a manner that of necessity excludes the expenditures made bv the respondent in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-4\">The claim is advanced that the provisions of \u00a7 28 are in a measure nullified, or at least rendered obscure, by the provisions of \u00a7 29. I am unable to discover the slightest conflict between the two sections. The former is directed solely against the offending candidate and provides a penalty for its violation. The latter is directed solely against the offending newspaper and provides a penalty of a different kind for its violation. Furthermore, the last clause of \u00a7 29 contains this express provision: \u201cBut this section shall not be construed as permitting the payment for any publication prohibited by section twenty-eight of this act;\u201d and, as we have seen, the - publication in question -is- twice 'prohibited by \u00a7 29.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">Reference is made in the majority opinion to an opinion of the attorney general of this state, but I deem this of no consequence. The opinion of that officer cannot obscure a statute which is otherwise plain, though it may elucidate a statute which is otherwise obscure. Furthermore, the attorney general is only required by law to give written opinions to the governor and other state officers on legal and constitutional questions relating to the duties of their respective offices, or to either branch of the state legislature or committees thereof on constitutional or legal questions, when requested so to do* Bal. Code, \u00a7 169 (P. C. \u00a7 8379). An opinion of the attorney general, not authorized or required by law, stands upon no different footing from the advice of any other counsel, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>cannot be looked to or considered by a court in construing a public statute of the state. The will of the people as expressed at the polls should ordinarily prevail, but the mode of exercising that will is regulated and controlled by the constitution and laws of the state, and when there is a conflict between the two, the latter must prevail.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">Inasmuch as the majority opinion fails to consider other objections urged by the respondent, I will not allude to them, further than to say that I find them without substantial merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">The writ should issue as prayed.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-7\">Fullerton, J., concurs with Rudkin, C. J.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-5\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b633-8\">Chadwick, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A7f1\">(concurring) \u2014 Assuming \u00a7 28 of the primary law to be constitutional, I agree with all that has been said by Judge Rudkin. I.believe it to be susceptible of construction, and that it does not conflict with \u00a7'29. I do not agree with the reasoning of Judges Mount and Crow, nor with the special reasons assigned by Judges Dunbar and Gose for their concurrence. Inasmuch as a majority of the court have decided that the writ shall not issue, it is perhaps idle to pursue the discussion, but because of the importance of this case, I feel that I am not unwarranted in expressing my reason for believing that the writ should be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-9\">Section 28 of the act' attempts to puf restrictions upon-the eligibility of the candidate that are not warranted by the constitution. It provides that a candidate <em>offending </em>against its provisions shall not be competent to qualify for the office to which he may have been elected. Eligibility of executive officers has been defined by the constitution of the state: \u201cNo person except a citizen and a qualified elector of this state shall be eligible to hold any state office,\u201d etc. Art. 3, \u00a7 25. In other words, the people have said that any one of their number who is a citizen of the United States and a qualified elector shall be eligible to hold the office of lieutenant governor. There is no qualification prescribed by statute for the elector that would bar the respondent in this case from assuming the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>duties of the office to which he has been elected. Bal. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 1320-1324 (P. C. \u00a7\u00a7 4768-4771). Section 28 of the direct primary law clearly puts upon the citizen a test of eligibility not contemplated by the people when adopting the constitution. Although the respondent published an article or statement prohibited by \u00a7 28, this cannot be made, by mere statutory enactment, a disqualification, for the constitution leaves no room for such action on the part of the legislature. Many states have passed corrupt practice acts and made the expenditure of money by a candidate, beyond certain prescribed limits, a misdemeanor or a ground of contest, or have deprived the candidate of the emoluments of the office. These laws have generally been sustained. But any attempt to add additional qualifications or to impose any limitations on the terms of eligibility fixed by the constitution has found no favor except in two instances, to which I shall refer:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-4\">\u201cHence, whenever any public office of any hind is made elective, . . . the constitution becomes <em>ex proprio vigore </em>applicable and operative, and fixes the qualifications for eligibility. This is a denial of power to the legislature to impose any greater restrictions or to add other qualifications for eligibility to these prescribed by the constitution.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Childs v. Holman, </em>58 Minn. 219, 59 N. W. 1006.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">The constitution of the state of Minnesota provides that any person having the qualifications \u00f3f a voter shall be eligible to-office. Ini the old case of <em>Barker v. People, </em>3 Cowen 686, it is said, im discussing\u2019the principle which I conceive to be involved here:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-7\">\u201cEligibility to public trusts is claimed as a constitutional right, which' cannot be abridged or impaired. . . . The constitution giving the right of election and the right of appointment; these rights consisting essentially in the freedom of choice; and the constitution also declaring, that certain persons are not eligible to office; it follows from these powers and provisions, that all other persons are eligible. Eligibility to office is not declared as a right or principle, by any express terms of the constitution; but it results, as a just deduction, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>from the express powers and provisions of the system. The basis of the principle is the absolute liberty of the electors and the appointing authorities, to choose and to appoint, any person, who is not made ineligible by the constitution. Eligibility to office, therefore, belongs, not exclusively or specially to electors, enjoying the right of suffrage. It belongs equally, to all persons whomsoever, not excluded by the constitution. I therefore conceive it to be entirely clear, that the legislature cannot establish arbitrary exclusions from office, or any general regulation requiring qualifications, which the constitution has not required.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">See, also, McCrary, Elections, \u00a7 312; Mechem, Public Officers, \u00a7 96; <em>Thomas v. Owens, </em>4 Md. 189.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">In the.case of <em>Page v. Hardin, </em>8 B. Mon. (Ky.) 648, it was held that a statute requiring the secretary of state to reside at the seat of government could not work a forfeiture of the office in the face of a constitutional provision saying that he might hold the office for a prescribed term, \u201cif he shall so long behave himself well.\u201d The supreme court of Ohio, <em>State ex rel. Attorney General v. Covington, </em>29 Ohio St. 102, and the supreme court of Colorado, <em>Darrow v. People, </em>8 Colo. 417, under constitutional provisions like our own, in that they say \u201cNo person shall be elected,\u201d etc., have held that this statement, being in the negative form, could not be taken as an inhibition upon the power of the legislature to add such <em>reasonable </em>qualifications as it deemed necessary in order to ensure an efficient and proper discharge of the office and, I may add, to ensure an incumbent who has the interest of a taxpayer in the execution of his trust. The rule adopted by these courts is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-7\">\u201cWe do not believe that the framers of the constitution, by this provision, intended to say that the right to vote should be the sole and exclusive test of eligibility to all civil offices, except as otherwise provided in the instrument itself; that no additional qualifications should ever be demanded, and no other disqualifications should he imposed. If, as has been well said, they \u2018had intended to take away from the legislature the power to name disqualifications for office, other than the one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>named in the constitution, it would not have been left to the very doubtful implication which is claimed from the provision under consideration.\u2019 <em>State ex rel. Attorney General v. Covington, 2</em>9 Ohio St. 102.\u201d <em>Darrow v. People, supra.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b636-4\">I am not willing to admit this to be the better rule, but if it be the rule, it in no wise militates against my attitude toward the case at bar. It cannot be denied othat, if the legislature has power to add other qualifications to those fixed in the constitution, they must be <em>reasonable. </em>It must be within the spirit if not the letter of the constitution. Now, is the provision that one who publishes an article or statement, as provided in section 28, a reasonable one? It cannot be so held. It does not go either to the character, capacity, sex or age of the candidate or his pecuniary interest in the affairs of state. It puts a test of eligibility (\u201che shall not be competent to qualify\u201d) upon the successful candidate unknown to the law, and in no way tending to safeguard the privilege of the public to select officials possessing some recognized standard of fitness. The condition is arbitrary and unreasonable. It does not pertain to the citizenship or mental or moral worth of the candidate. Therefore, in construing the constitutional provision, whether it be held that the legislature can add no qualification, or may add such reasonable qualifications as are not excluded by necessary implication, it makes no difference. Under the first construction, the respondent is entitled to his office; under the second, he cannot be denied, for the reason that the added qualification is neither reasonable or necessary to the faithful and competent administration of his office. Upon either theory section 28 violates section 25, art. 3, of the constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">The writ should have been denied for the reasons herein suggested.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
