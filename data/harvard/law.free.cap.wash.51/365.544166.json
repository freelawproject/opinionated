The complaint, in substance, is to the effect that the defendant, at Rossland, in the Province of British Columbia, Dominion of Canada, at different times ranging from January-23, 1899, to the 28th of March, 1900, executed notes to different parties, in the aggregate sum of $4,302, which notes were assigned for value to the plaintiff, the different notes being pleaded as separate causes of action. To this complaint a demurrer was interposed, the first ground of the demurrer being that it appears upon the face of said cause of action, and the allegations made and set forth therein, that said cause of action is barred by the statute of limitations. It is conceded that the statute of limitations ran before the commencement of the action, and that the demurrer was properly sustained unless the bar of the statute had been removed by an acknowledgment of or promise to pay the debt. The court sustained the demurrer, and the plaintiff appealed, relying upon the following correspondence between the parties to remove the bar:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-6\">\u201cRossland, B.

The property as you know is good and should sell for a fair price. Could you make me a cash offer for over and above of our differences on the St. Pauls and Belcher.

No, I cannot make you an offer for your interest in the properties. Enclosed is a statement of your indebtedness on which I will make a rebate if you can arrange to pay now or give ample security.

I will again ask you to try and make a disposition of the St. Pauls and Belcher, or let some one have it on a bond, as I would like to have a little money out of it myself as I intend to go to Alaska in June or July. Hoping to hear from you soon. Respectfully yours, Frank Guse.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b415-9\">Our statute provides (Bal. Code, \u00a7 1816; P. C. \u00a7 300), that no acknowledgment or promise shall be sufficient evidence of a new or continuing contract whereby to take the case out of the operation of this chapter, unless the same is contained in some writing signed by the party to be charged thereby. It is contended by the respondent that there are several rules of law applicable to the question in this case, any of which considered alone would be sufficient to sustain the judgment of the superior court: (1) detached statements and fragmentary writings cannot be considered together in the utter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>anee of a new promise or acknowledgment; (2) where no promise to pay is made, the acknowledgment of the particular debt must be in terms so clear and unequivocal that a promise is raised as a natural inference from the language used; (3) where there are several debts, a general acknowledgment of the same is insufficient; (4) where the debtor claims offsets to the debt, this rebuts the inference of a promise to pay; (5) where the acknowledgment leaves the amount of the debt in dispute, it is insufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">These propositions, we think, are all well established by the great weight of authority. Many cases are cited by both the appellant and respondent, in which the correspondence relied upon is set forth, but it would be fruitless to review them here, for the reason that the expressions used in the various cases cited are different and might be differently construed by different courts. Every case, therefore, will have to be construed with reference to the language used in that particular case. Statutes of limitation are in aid of a sound public policy and have received the almost universal commendation of law-making bodies. Referring to the first rule invoked by the respondent, if detached statements and fragmentary writings of different dates, susceptible of different interpretations and which might be equally applicable to different transactions or debts, should be held to be sufficient to remove the bar of the statute, such holding would tend to destroy the object of the statute and make uncertain and speculative the very thing which the statute sought to make definite, and certain, and mere inference would be substituted for direct and positive expression.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">It cannot be contended in this case that there is any promise whatever to pay the alleged debt, or any part of it. Conceding that the statement in <em>Liberman v. Gurensky, </em>27 Wash. 410, 67 Pac. 998, which is criticized by the appellant, and which is to the effect that a mere acknowledgment of a debt is insufficient, was an extreme statement and not necessary to the decision of the case, it is well established that, where <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>acknowledgment alone is relied upon, the expression of the acknowledgment must be clear and unequivocal and made with reference to a particular debt which is subsisting at the time. The acknowledgment must be so clear that a promise to pay must necessarily be implied. It must be borne in mind that several causes of action are stated in the complaint in this case, the obligation arising from six different notes given at different times and to two different payees. In the light of this fact, even construing all of the detached statements together, it cannot be ascertained that any definite acknowledgment was made of indebtedness of all the notes or of any particular one of them. On the contrary, the whole correspondence shows that there was a controversy between the parties, and that controversy may have been in relation to these notes or it may have been in relation to some other transaction between the parties. There is no promise to pay in whole or in part. There is no definite acknowledgment of the indebtedness in whole or in part, and while it is true that no particular form of expression is necessary, to constitute an acknowledgment, the expression, whatever it is, must be clear and unequivocal. Such expressions are not shown by the correspondence here.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">Hadley, C. J., Chadwick, Ckow, Fullerton, Rudkin, and Mount, JJ., concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
