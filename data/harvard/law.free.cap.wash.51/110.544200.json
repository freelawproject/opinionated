C. Pollman, was and is a lawful practitioner of some of the branches of medicine and surgery, in such a manner as to convey the impression that he, the said B. C. Pollman, was and is a practitioner of medicine and surgery under the laws of the state of Washington, and did cause to be published in the Bellingham Herald, a daily newspaper of general circulation in the city of Bellingham and in the county of Whatcom, and in the state of Washington, an advertisement in words, figures and expressions as follows, to wit:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-8\">DR.

Humanity has slumbered many years in ignorance, and were kept in such condition by some rulers and their professed religious creed until God strengthened the mind of humanity, liberated man from slavery and endowed him with sufficient power to exercise his own five physical senses by which he has gained the great power of thought, force and freedom of progression.

Pollman did first make a diagnosis of each case for the purpose of determining the particular malady or disease from which said persons were suffering, and did thereafter treat said persons for said diseases above mentioned by kneading, rubbing, pressing, and otherwise manually manipulating the body, limbs, muscles, and nerves, and by flexing and manually manipulating the joints, and so the prosecuting attorney, as aforesaid, doth accuse the said B. C. Pollman of the crime of practicing medicine without a license, all of which is contrary to the form of the statute in such case made and provided, and against the peace and dignity of the state of Washington.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-12\">\u201cDated at Bellingham, in the county of Whatcom, state of Washington, on this 22nd day of November, 1907.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b161-13\">After arraignment the appellant demurred to the information on the ground that it did not state facts sufficient to constitute a crime. The demurrer was overruled, whereupon the appellant elected to stand and abide by his demurrer, and prayed the judgment of the court at that time. The court thereupon adjudged him guilty of practicing medicine without a license, and sentenced him to pay a fine. This appeal is from the judgment so pronounced.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-14\">The statute regulating the practice of medicine in this state provides, among other things, that before any person <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>shall be entitled to practice medicine he shall procure from the board of examiners created by a statute a license so to do, which license shall be filed in the office of the county where the practitioner resides. Section 8 of the act, as. amended in 1901 (see p. 50), reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-5\">\u201cSection 8. Any person practicing medicine or surgery or either of its or their branches within this state without first having obtained, and filed the license provided for in this act, or contrary to the provisions of this act, shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and upon conviction thereof shall be fined not less than fifty dollars nor more than one hundred dollars or by imprisonment in the county jail not less than ten days nor more than ninety days, or by both such fine and imprisonment. In all prosecutions under the provisions of this act, evidence that the defendant has failed to file a license with the county clerk as herein required, shall be <em>prima facie </em>evidence that the defendant is not a legally licensed practitioner. And each day o\u00a3 such illegal practice shall be deemed a separate offense under this act. All fines collected under the provisions of this act shall be paid into the state treasury for the use and benefit of the common schools of this state. Any person shall be deemed as practicing within the meaning of this act who shall have and maintain an office or place of business with his or her \u2019 name and the words physician or surgeon \u2018Doctor,\u2019 \u2018M. D.\u2019 or \u2018M. B.\u2019 in public view, or shall assume or advertise the title of doctor or any title which shall show or shall tend to show that the person assuming or advertising the same is a lawful practitioner of any of the branches of medicine or surgery in such a manner as to convey the impression that he or she is a practitioner of medicine or surgery under the laws of this state; or any person who shall practice medicine or surgery under a false or assumed name, or under cover of the name of some legal practitioner, or personate any legal practitioner or for a fee prescribe or direct, or recommend for the use of any person any drug or medicine for the treatment, care or relief of any wound, fracture or bodily injury, infirmity or disease: <em>Provided, however, </em>That this act shall not apply to dentists while confining themselves strictly to dentistry. Justices of the peace and the superior court shall have concurrent jurisdiction of violations of this act and it shall be the duty of the respective county or district attorneys; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>to prosecute all violations of this act. In cases of appeal to the superior court as hereinbefore provided, it shall be the duty of the prosecuting attorney of the county wherein such appeal shall be tried to represent said board upon said appeal. And in all cases of appeal to the supreme court under the provisions of this act the attorney general shall represent said board upon such appeal.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">The appellant contends that a statute prohibiting the \u201cpractice of medicine and surgery, or either of its or their branches, within this state without first having obtained and filed\u201d a license, without further definition of the act prohibited would be nugatory for want of certainty, it being impossible to know what acts the legislature intended to include in the phrase, \u201cthe practice of medicine and surgery\u201d; and hence that the only thing in the statute cited that can be construed as being prohibited is the maintaining of an office or place of business and advertising as a physician or surgeon as therein described, and that this latter prohibition is not only not within the title of the act, but is in excess of the powers of the legislature, because not a proper subject of police regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">Whether the words \u201cpracticing medicine or surgery\u201d are sufficiently definitive of the acts intended to be prohibited to enable a court to say that any given state of facts would constitute a crime thereunder, is a question we need not here determine, as we think the remainder of the statute does prohibit acts which the appellant has committed. He has maintained an office and place of business in front of and on the doors of which he has caused his name to be lettered, with the words, \u201cPhysician,\u201d and \u201cDr.\u201d and has otherwise advertised a title which tended to show that he was a lawful practitioner of medicine and surgery under the laws of the state of Washington, when in fact he was not such a practitioner. It is competent for the legislature to prohibit acts of this kind. Its purpose in so doing is to protect the people against deception. The titles which the statute sets out are those usually associated with practitioners of the regular schools who treat <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>diseases by the administration of remedies in the nature of drugs and their compounds, rather than with practitioners who treat solely by appeals to divinity, the occult, or by \u201cmanually manipulating the limbs, muscles, and nerves, and by flexing and manually manipulating the joints of the body,\u201d and it is practitioners of the regular schools rather than the others that the ill and infirm seeking relief usually expect to find when entering a room whose door has lettered upon it the name of a person preceded by the title \u201cDr.\u201d or followed' by the letters \u201cM. D.\u201d or \u201cPhysician and Surgeon.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">The appellant, it is true, prefixed to the word \u201cphysician\u201d the words \u201cOsteopathic and Magnetic\u201d in one instance, and the word \u201cDrugless\u201d in another; but these do not make the use of the word lawful. The statute is a prohibition against any use of the word in connection with announcements of the profession or business of a person other than practitioners of medicine and surgery who have passed the examination prescribed in the statute and received the license therein provided for, and this prohibition is not evaded by the use of qualifying adjectives prefixed to the prohibited words. The statute also uses the word \u201cdoctor\u201d instead of the more common abbreviation \u201cDr.\u201d, but it is equally a prohibition against the use of either. Its purpose being to prevent deception, the courts will give to it that meaning which will most effectually accomplish that purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">It is said, however, that the part of the statute here in consideration could not lawfully be enacted under an act entitled \u201cAn act to regulate the practice of medicine and surgery in the state of Washington,\u201d etc., but we think the title sufficiently broad. To provide who may lawfully call themselves \u201cDoctors,\u201d \u201cPhysicians,\u201d or \u201cSurgeons,\u201d is clearly within the title of an act entitled \u201cAn act to regulate the practice of medicine and surgery.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b164-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-8\">Hadley, C. J., Rudkin, Crow, Mount, and Dunbar, JJ., concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
