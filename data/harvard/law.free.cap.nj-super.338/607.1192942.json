C\u00f3rtese appeals from the October 21, 1999, determination of the Board of Trustees of the Public Employees\u2019 Retirement System (PERS), adopting the July 27, 1999, initial decision of an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) that a $63,685 payment to petitioner that was made by Essex County Utilities Authority (ECUA) was not creditable compensation for pension purposes. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-8\">Pursuant to a written agreement dated October 15,1995, ECUA employed petitioner, a Certified Public Accountant, as its Director of Finance and Administration. Under Section (4)(a) of the agreement, \u201cBase Compensation,\u201d ECUA paid him \u201con an hourly basis for the actual amount of hours of service provided ... calculated on the basis of an annual salary of $89,000.\u201d The agreement also provided in Section 4(b)(1) for \u201cAdditional Compensation\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-9\">In the event that the ECUA undertakes any financing (either through the issuance of short-term project notes or long-term revenue bonds) for or with respect to the Solid Waste System during the term of this Agreement, [petitioner] shall (in consideration for services provided in support thereof), receive additional compensation ... in a fixed amount equal to $1.00 per $1,000 principal amount of project notes or revenue bonds issued.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b641-10\">Petitioner performed services for ECUA in connection with ECUA\u2019s issuance in 1996 of $63,685,000 in revenue bonds. He received $63,685 for these services as \u201cAdditional Compensation\u201d under Section 4(b)(1) of the Agreement. No other short-term project notes or long-term revenue bonds were issued by ECUA during the term of the agreement. This appeal turns on whether that payment is pensionable.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-11\">On its initial review of petitioner\u2019s application, PERS concluded that the $63,685 payment represented additional compensation beyond his base salary and, pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:15A-6(r) and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number><em>N.J.A.C. </em>17:2-4.1, that this amount would not be included in petitioner\u2019s compensation for pension-calculation purposes. PERS ultimately referred petitioner\u2019s objection to this decision to the Office of Administrative Law for contested-case disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">Reviewing the history and background of petitioner\u2019s job duties and actual services, the ALJ concluded that petitioner\u2019s commission was not creditable for pension purposes. She reasoned that petitioner\u2019s bond-financing activities were part of his job responsibilities under the contract, but were a thing apart from his regular job duties and were \u201cextracurricular.\u201d The ALJ\u2019s initial decision thus recommended exclusion of the commission from petitioner\u2019s pension calculation.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">In considering the reasoning of the ALJ, which PERS accepted in full, we look first to the controlling statutory and regulatory provisions on which she relied. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:15A-6(r) defines \u201ccompensation\u201d for pension-calculation purposes as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Afu\">the base or contractual salary, for services as an employee, which is in accordance with established salary policies of the member\u2019s employer for all employees in the same position but <em>shall not include </em>individual salary adjustments which are granted primarily in anticipation of the member\u2019s retirement or <em>additional remuneration for performing temporary or extracurricular duties beyond the regular work day or the regular work year </em>....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-7\">[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b642-8\">In implementing the statutory definition, <em>N.J.A.C. </em>17:2^4.1 denominates all non-creditable compensation that is not part of \u201cbase or contractual salary\u201d as \u201cextra compensation,\u201d and while it does not undertake to define \u201cextra compensation\u201d beyond the statutory definition, subparagraph (d) of that regulation gives the following examples of extra compensation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-9\">Some of the forms of compensation that have been defined as extra compensation are as follows: overtime, bonus, longevity lump sum payments, individual retroactive salary adjustments or individual adjustments to place a member at maximum in his salary range in the final year of service, increments granted for retirement credit or in recognition of the member\u2019s forthcoming retirement or in recognition of the member\u2019s years of service in the community.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b642-10\">The sole question before us is whether PERS, in concluding that the commission was extra compensation, correctly applied the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>statutory concepts of \u201cservices as an employee\u201d and \u201cadditional remuneration for performing temporary or extracurricular duties\u201d to the undisputed facts relating to petitioner\u2019s position at the ECUA. We are persuaded that the result here was correct, although we base this conclusion on a somewhat different ground than that used by the ALJ and adopted by PERS.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">We are not bound by the interpretation and application by an administrative agency of the statute it is charged with implementing, but we generally accord deference to such interpretations and applications. <em>See, e.g., Smith v. Director, Div. of Taxation, </em>108 <em>N.J. </em>19, 26, 527 A.2d 843, (1987); <em>Terner v. Spyco, Inc., </em>226 <em>N.J.Super. </em>532, 547, 545 A.2d 192 (App.Div.1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">We conclude that, with the exceptions referred to below, the determinations made by the ALJ and PERS were based on substantial evidence in the record and were not arbitrary, unreasonable, or capricious. We part company, however, with the ALJ and PERS over the characterization of the payment to petitioner as having been made for work that was \u201cextracurricular.\u201d From the statutory reference to duties \u201cbeyond the regular work day or the regular work year,\u201d and from the foregoing regulatory list of examples, we conclude that the term \u201cextracurricular\u201d was essentially used to prohibit pension credit for overtime, special assignments, and the like. The work on the bond issue was not in that sense \u201cextracurricular,\u201d because it was connected with the financial operations of the employer, ECUA.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-7\">We are satisfied, however, the work is question, though not \u201cextracurricular,\u201d was \u201ctemporary\u201d as defined by the statute. The statutory bar does not refer to a temporary position but rather to the performance of \u201ctemporary ... duties.\u201d <em>Rokos v. State, Dept. of Treasury, Div. of Pensions, Public Employees\u2019 Retirement System, </em>236 <em>N.J.Super. </em>174, 564 A.2d 1217 (App.Div. 1989). Whether or not petitioner\u2019s position was itself temporary, the duties pertaining to bond issues that were assigned to that position, and were to arise only \u201cin the event that the ECUA undertakes any financing,\u201d were \u201ctemporary.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b644-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>\u201cTemporary\u201d is the opposite of \u201cpermanent\u201d and means \u201cfor a limited time only,\u201d <em>Flamm v. City of Passaic, </em>14 <em>N.J. Misc. </em>362, 365, 184 <em>A. </em>748 (C.P.1936), or \u201clasting for a limited time.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary </em>1214 (9th ed.1984). \u201cTemporary\u201d also means \u201cmade to supply a passing need,\u201d <em>The New Shorter Oxford English Dictionary </em>2259 (1973), and this describes well the services provided by petitioner in connection with the $63,685,000 bond issue. Petitioner\u2019s services pertaining to the bond issue in our view are most precisely described as \u201coccasional.\u201d The term \u201coccasional\u201d means \u201c[hjappening or operating on some particular occasion; limited to specific occasions ...\u201d and \u201c[a]cting or employed for the occasion or on particular occasions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1432. The occasional services to be rendered by petitioner under the agreement were a category of temporary services even less enduring and regular than those of a temporary office employee hired for a short period. Petitioner\u2019s services for which the $63,685 was paid plainly were occasional and thus \u201ctemporary\u201d as provided in <em>N.J.S.A </em>43:15A-6(r).</p>\n<p id=\"b644-4\">Accordingly, we conclude that the PERS determination excluding petitioner\u2019s $63,685 in temporary earnings from his creditable compensation for pension purposes was correct because it was for \u201ctemporary ... duties\u201d and did not form part of his \u201cbase or contractual\u201d pay. Moreover, we do not address in this appeal the public policy grounds discussed in the ALJ\u2019s initial decision. We express no views as to that discussion and dispose of this appeal solely on the grounds stated above.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">The decision appealed from is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
