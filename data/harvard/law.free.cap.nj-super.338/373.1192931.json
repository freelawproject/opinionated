Zoning Board of Adjustment, </em>277 <em>N.J.Super. </em>130, 649 A.2d 98 (App.Div.1994), where we held that the Right to Farm Act, <em>N.J.S.A </em>4:1C-1 to -10 (amended 1998) (the Act), did not preempt municipal land use authority over commercial farms, the Legislature amended the Act. <em>L. </em>1998 c. 48 \u00a7\u00a7 1-8 <em>(N.J.S.A. </em>4:1C-1 to -10.4). This appeal requires us to determine whether the amendments to the Act preempt municipal land use jurisdiction over such farms and, more specifically, whether a municipality may require a commercial farmer to comply with local land use ordinances including site plan approval. We conclude there is preemption, and that primary jurisdiction to regulate agricultural management practices rests with the County Agricultural Board (CAB) or the State Agricultural Development Committee (SADC). We further hold that in fulfilling their responsibility to regulate agricultural management practices under the Act, both the CAB and the SADC must consider the impact of such practices on municipalities and, in so doing, consider the limitations imposed by local land use and zoning ordinances <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>adopted pursuant to the Municipal Land Use Law (MLUL), <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:55D-1 to -112. We conclude that on remand to the CAB, the CAB, exercising primary jurisdiction, must first determine whether defendant\u2019s activities fall within the purview of \u201cagricultural management practices.\u201d If so, upon assuming jurisdiction, the CAB, or SADC, where appropriate, must consider not only the impact of such practices on the municipality, but the standards established by local ordinances, all within the scope of the agency\u2019s statutory obligation to consider public health and safety. If the CAB or SADC determines that the proposed activity falls outside of the scope of agricultural management practices, jurisdiction then resides with the municipality and its appropriate agencies to enforce its local land use and other relevant ordinances.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">\n<em>I.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-7\">We address this issue in the following factual and procedural context. Defendants David den Hollander, Garden State Growers and Quaker Valley Farms collectively own 143 acres in Franklin Township, Hunterdon County. The property is zoned AR-7, Agricultural-Residential, which permits agricultural uses. One-hundred and nineteen acres of the property are subject to a Deed of Easement benefitting the Hunterdon County Agricultural Development Board and/or the New Jersey State Agricultural Development Committee.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-8\">Defendants operate a large-scale ornamental plant production operation that employs 150 workers, and have installed concrete sidewalks, gravel and paved areas, plastic impervious ground <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>cover, storm water control structures, and greenhouses called \u201choop houses.\u201d The hoop houses are constructed of steel pipe frames, wood, and plastic, and are approximately 14 feet wide, 200 feet long, and 6 feet 6 inches high at the center of the arch. They average 2800 square feet in size. Defendants\u2019 characterization of these structures as temporary is disputed by plaintiff Township of Franklin, which notes that the structures have remained in place since their construction in the mid-1980\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-4\">On April 16, 1998, plaintiff filed a multi-count complaint in the Law Division, Hunterdon County, against defendants seeking declaratory relief and related permanent injunctive relief. We will summarize plaintiffs allegations. Specifically, plaintiff alleged that defendants were in violation of provisions of their Deed of Easement and unspecified township regulations, and that \u201c[djefendants\u2019 failure to comply with the Deed of Easement and/or [regulations constituted] a nuisance adversely affecting the health, safety and welfare of the residents of the Township.\u201d Defendants failed to conform their agricultural practices to those recommended by the SADC, and to \u201crelevant federal or State statutes or rules and regulations which as a consequence pose[d] a direct threat to the public health, safety and welfare.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">Defendants built structures on the property without receiving approval from the appropriate township agencies, and \u201ccontinued to threaten to use said structures in derogation of lawful rules and regulations of the Township.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">Defendants \u201ccreated a trucking terminal in a residential district of the Township ... [and] parking areas on site for non-passenger vehicles without site plan approval,\u201d and permitted trucks to park on land adjacent to the property, creating an inappropriate impact on adjoining residential properties. The noise created by the trucks disrupted the \u201cpeace and tranquility of the adjoining residential neighborhood.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b409-7\">Defendants had \u201cnot complied with Federal regulations regarding ascertaining the qualification\u201d of the workers employed on the property, noting that defendants allowed the workers to \u201cavoid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>using designated approved sanitary facilities\u201d and that the workers \u201cperform[ed] individual waste disposal function in public view.\u201d Such activity, plaintiff claimed, violated sanitary codes of various agencies and criminal statutes of the State of New Jersey, and created a health hazard \u201cboth to other workers and the public in general.\u201d Furthermore, defendants failed to obtain the necessary prior approval before employing more than twenty-five employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">Next, defendants expanded their use of the property in derogation of the limits set forth on the site plan and without proper approval, and that defendants were bound as successors in interest to a compliance agreement with the Hunterdon County Soil Conservation District which contained a Farm Conservation Plan. Defendants installed impervious surfaces without approval and in violation of township ordinances:</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">Attached to plaintiffs complaint was the certification of Linda Peterson, a civil engineer employed by the United States Department of Agriculture Natural Resources Conservation Service (USDA-NRCS), which had been submitted by the plaintiff in <em>Hunterdon County Soil Conservation District v. den Hollander, </em>C-14007-97, <em>aff'd, </em>Nos. A-6650-96, A-4028-97 (App. Div. Feb 23, 1999). Peterson stated that most of defendants\u2019 property is devoted to permanent greenhouse production and processing, that \u201cthe cultural methods employed by [defendants] results in an extremely high percentage of impervious area,\u201d and that the \u201cimpervious areas drastically increase runoff which may cause excessive soil erosion, off-site damage, and the degradation of water quality.\u201d Peterson further noted that defendants failed to maintain a detention basin system to control runoff from the hoop houses. She observed that the basin area was used for parking and storage, that concrete lanes were constructed around the large production blocks in the mum fields, and that \u201cuncontrolled runoff from the field deposits sediment at the lower edge of the field before concentrating into unstable channels.\u201d The gullies, she explained, \u201coutlet the runoff through the woods and eventually into Lockatong Creek.\u201d She further stated that defendants never <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>completed or stabilized soil erosion and sediment control measures that were recommended by USDA-NRCS to divert runoff around the mum field, resulting in severe erosion delivering a significant amount of sediment into the creek. Finally, Peterson opined that \u201c[a] USDA-NRCS Farm Conservation Plan, if properly installed and maintained, would address both water quantity and ... quality issues\u201d at the farm.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">Plaintiff also submitted the certification of Tony M. Ganguzza, Municipal and Planning Board Engineer for the Township of Franklin, detailing extensive alleged violations of various land use and zoning ordinances. We briefly identify those sections of plaintiffs township land use ordinances identified as relevant to the issues before us, and then summarize Ganguzza\u2019s allegations. Section 118-40A(l)(b)[7] of the township code provides that site plan approval is required for the construction of farm structures in excess of 7% of the land area, or of any farm structure greater than 20,000 square feet. <em>Franklin, N.J., Code </em>\u00a7 118-40A(1)(b)[7]. Section 85-4 defines farm structures as \u201c[a]ny and all farm structures, for example, barns, silos, food storage structures, greenhouses, processing structures, machinery or utility storage structures, watering and livestock buildings and roadside stands.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 85-4. Section 85-21 requires that no building or structure be constructed until a building permit has been procured by filing an application in accordance with the construction code of the township, <em>id. </em>at \u00a7 85-21A, which also limits impervious coverage of a lot in the AR-7.0 Agricultural Residential Zone to 10%.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-7\">Ganguzza stated that defendants failed to build two retention ponds essential to surface water management and that the absence of the ponds suggested violations of local ordinances and a June 10, 1996 order of the Law Division which permitted defendants to improve the property in accordance with the Site Plan and Site Grading Plan (Site Plan). Based on aerial photographs, Ganguzza concluded that the area where Pond 1 was to be located was instead an open area, and that the area designated for Pond 2 was instead used for truck and trailer parking. There was no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>planning board review or approval for those deviations from the Site Plan, nor was there approval of the installation of a parking area as required by municipal ordinances. The Site Plan provided for 76 parking spaces in three designated areas only. In addition to the unapproved parking in the area of Pond 2, truck parking also occurred along the southerly side of a \u201cproposed greenhouse\u201d for which no approval was obtained as required by local ordinance. Defendants also had not obtained approval for three greenhouses and a truck parking area located in Block 37, Lot 42, which together comprised approximately 28 acres of farm structures on that 119 acre section. These improvements were constructed contrary to the 7% limitation provided by Section 118-40.-A(l)(b)[7], which would only permit up to 8.4 acres of farm structures without prior approval. These structures included hoop houses, barns, and associated structures. Assuming that the hoop houses are impervious surfaces as well as structures, the lot coverage substantially exceeded the 10% maximum impervious surface ratio. Sixty-five percent of the mum field was covered by impervious material, including concrete walkways and gravel-filled areas, also in violation of the 10% coverage maximum. The concrete walkways were approximately 10 to 12 feet wide and large vehicles were parked at the corners. Walkways of that width were not intended for pedestrian traffic, but rather for an internal transportation system using those vehicles. Ganguzza calculated that these walkways and gravel-filled areas exceeded 53,000 square feet of impervious coverage, or more than ten times the minimum soil disturbance threshold permitted without approval under Sections 112-1 and 118-40.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">Ganguzza also stated that the soil erosion and sediment control plan (RT plan) submitted by defendants was not credible and was contradicted by aerial photographs. For example, the RT plan identified the area designated as Pond 2 on the Site Plan as \u201cBasin #2.\u201d This designated use was inconsistent with the photographs indicating that the Pond 2 area was actually being used for truck parking. Furthermore, there was a notation on the RT plan for a \u201cBerm to be Extended\u201d which was contradicted by a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>photograph demonstrating that the existing berm lies between \u201cHoop Greenhouse 2\u201d and the Pond 2 parking area, making extension of the berm impossible. Based on another aerial photograph, Ganguzza concluded that the RT plan also failed to account for the demolition of buildings which had been situated south of Field 2, and that defendants had not obtained a permit for that demolition or for attendant regrading and restoration of the area. The RT plan also identified an \u201cIrrigation Pond\u201d to the west of Field 4 and an \u201cExtended Detention Basin 3\u201d in the northwest corner of Field 6 which would have required approval. Ganguzza observed that the area designated as \u201cBasin 3\u201d was actually being used for truck parking.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">Ganguzza further observed that the RT plan revealed a need for proper soil detention on defendants\u2019 property, as Fields 4 and 6 were located along either side of Lockatong Creek, which also flows along the southern boundary of defendants\u2019 mum field and across the southeast corner of Field 2, and a new gravel road connecting Fields 2 and 6 had been constructed by traversing the creek.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-7\">Ganguzza concluded based on \u201cusual and customarily accepted engineering standards,\u201d that defendants\u2019 violations of the township\u2019s ordinances and their deviations from the Site Plan posed an immediate threat to the health, safety, and welfare of township residents due to defendants\u2019 unregulated and unapproved structures and uses. He attributed the surface water flow problems to defendants\u2019 building and construction, and opined that the \u201cLockatong Creek and its associated corridor have been and remain in jeopardy of ongoing degradation.\u201d He also opined that the absence of previously approved water quality structures indicated that improperly treated or untreated water was flowing both on- and off-site, and that the truck parking area compounded the problem. Ganguzza urged that necessary remedies might include the removal of some of the structures and relocation of others, and would require re-establishment of previously required water quality features.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>B.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">After the issues were joined by the pleadings, defendants filed a motion to transfer the proceedings from the trial court to the Hunterdon County Agricultural Development Board on the ground that the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction. Defendants argued that the Act preempted the MLUL and accompanying local zoning and land use regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">The trial judge denied defendants\u2019 application. Although the judge found for purposes of the motion that defendants\u2019 operation was a commercial farm operation as defined by the Act, he disagreed with defendants\u2019 interpretation of the meaning and significance of the Act as amended and the administrative regulations. The judge concluded that the <em>post-Villari </em>amendments to the Act did not preempt the court\u2019s jurisdiction to consider \u201c[p]ure zoning and site plan issues.\u201d He further opined that a judge would make an appropriate determination of which issues were properly before the court and which were within the jurisdiction of the CAB. We granted leave to appeal from his interlocutory order, and now reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-7\">The parties\u2019 arguments on appeal are simply stated. Defendants claim that the amended Act preempts the MLUL by conditionally restricting application of municipal regulation of agricultural activities.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Defendants argue that the Act and attendant regulations require that disputes involving commercial farm operations be resolved by the designated agricultural board rather than a trial court. Defendants further argue that although <em>Villari </em>remains \u201cgood law,\u201d the amended Act mandates a new and different analysis of the issue presented. Plaintiff agrees with the trial judge that the issues are severable and \u201cpure zoning and land use issues\u201d are not preempted.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>\n<em>II.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">The Act represents a legislative determination \u201cto promote, to the greatest extent practicable and feasible, the continuation of agriculture in the State of New Jersey while recognizing the potential conflicts among all lawful activities in the State.\u201d <em>Senate Natural Resources and Agriculture Committee, Statement to S. 85k (L. </em>1983, c. 31). Among its other stated purposes, the Act is intended to protect commercial farm operations from nuisance actions. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>4:lC-2(e). The Act and similar enactments in virtually every other jurisdiction,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u201cprotect working lands from the encroachment of residential development,\u201d and \u201cwere created to address a growing concern that too much farmland was being overtaken by urban sprawl\u201d as a result of nuisance suits which \u201cfrustrated farming operations and encouraged farmers to sell to developers.\u201d Jesse L. Richardson, Jr. &amp; Theodore A. Feitshans, <em>Nuisance Revisited After Buchanan and Bormann, 5 Drake J. Agrie. L. </em>121, 127-28 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">The Act and the proliferation of other similar statutes nationwide revealed an obvious tension between the rights of farmers with land protected by such provisions and local governments which perceived a need to protect those outside of the scope of such acts. This tension was observed by a commentator as early as 1984:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-7\">Local ordinances pose a much more serious threat than do state laws to the effective operation of the right-to-farm statutes. The shift in local political power occurring when suburbanites move into an agricultural district often leads to the passage of local ordinances limiting various farm activities.... Insulation from such ordinances is an important component of an effective right-to-farm statute. A state legislature that defers to the local government in this manner effectively nullifies its policy choice of preferring agricultural activities over other conflicting land uses.... [Tlhe value of an explicit preemption of local statutes and ordinances lies in its ability to discourage local governments from passing limiting regulations and to give the farmer a sense of security against attempted limitations of his/her operations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>[Jacqueline P. Hand, <em>Rightr-to-Farm Laws: Breaking New Ground in the Preservation of Farmland, </em>45 <em>U. Pitt. L.Rev. </em>289, 322-23 (1984) (footnotes omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">In <em>Villari supra, </em>277 <em>N.J.Super. </em>130, 649 A.2d 98, we confronted the issue of the relationship between the Act and local ordinances enabled by the MLUL. We held that the Act did not preempt or override the powers conferred upon municipal governments by the MLUL. <em>Id. </em>at 134, 649 A.2d 98. We concluded that the Act failed to evince an explicit legislative intent to override a municipality\u2019s authority to zone all property located within its boundaries, observing that the Act failed to even mention the MLUL. <em>Id. </em>at 138-39, 649 A.2d 98.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">Because the Act did not expressly override the MLUL, we explored, but rejected, repeal of the MLUL by implication. <em>Id. </em>at 139, 649 A.2d 98. We reasoned that the Act could preempt municipal zoning ordinances only if it impliedly repealed that part of the MLUL which confers comprehensive zoning power upon municipalities. <em>Ibid. </em>In finding there was no clear and compelling demonstration of legislative intent to repeal the MLUL by implication, we noted the strong presumption against implied repealers, and concluded there was no \u201cclear and compelling evidence of a legislative intent to displace municipal power over zoning insofar as it applies to commercial agricultural uses.\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(citing <em>Township of Mahwah v. Bergen County Bd. of Taxation, </em>98 <em>N.J. </em>268, 281, 486 A.2d 818, <em>cert. denied sub nom. Borough of Demarest v. Township of Mahwah, </em>471 <em>U.S. </em>1136, 105 <em>S.Ct. </em>2677, 86 L.Ed.2d 696 (1985)). We examined legislative practices in delegating zoning power to other governmental entities, such as the Hackensack Meadowlands Development Commission and the New Jersey Building Authority, and noted that in those eases, the Legislature clearly and expressly exempted certain properties from municipal zoning. <em>Id. </em>at 139-40, 649 A.2d 98 (discussing the Hackensack Meadowlands Reclamation and Development Act, <em>N.J.S.A </em>13:17-1 to -86, and the New Jersey Building Authority Act, <em>N.J.S.A </em>52:18A-78.1 to -78.32). Thus, we concluded, \u201c[i]f the Legislature had intended commercial agricultural uses to enjoy a comparable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>exemption from municipal zoning, it would undoubtedly have expressed that intent with equal clarity, especially since such an exemption would have a potentially far-reaching impact upon municipal land use control.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 140, 649 A.2d 98.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">Subsequent to our decision in <em>Villari, </em>the Legislature amended the Act<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> to read, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-7\">Notwithstanding the provisions of any municipal or county ordinance, resolution, or regulation to the contrary, the owner or operator of a commercial farm, located in an area in which, as of December 31, 1997 or thereafter, agriculture is a permitted use under the municipal zoning ordinance and is consistent with the municipal master plan, or which commercial farm is in operation as of the effective date of P.L.1998, c. 48 (C.4:lC-3 et al), and the operation of which conforms to agricultural management practices recommended by the committee and adopted pursuant to the provisions of the \u201cAdministrative Procedure Act,\u201d P.L.1968, c. 410 (C.52U4B-1 et seq.), or whose specific operation or practice has been determined by the appropriate county board, or in a county where no county board exists, the committee, to constitute a generally accepted agricultural operation or practice, and all relevant federal or State statutes or rules and regulations adopted pursuant thereto, and which does not pose a direct threat to public health and safety may:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-8\">a.

In addition, the municipal governing body \u201cmay adopt or amend a zoning ordinance relating to the nature and extent of the uses of land and of buildings and structures thereon.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:55D~62a. According to the MLUL, a zoning ordinance may:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-8\">a. Limit and restrict buildings and structures to specified districts and regulate buildings and structures according to their type and the nature and extent of their use, and regulate the nature and extent of the use of land for trade, industry, residence, open space or other purposes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-9\">b. Regulate the bulk, height, number of stories, orientation, and size of building and the other structures; the percentage of lot or development area that may be occupied by structures; lot sizes and dimensions; and for these purposes may specify floor area ratios and other ratios and regulatory techniques governing the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>intensity of land use and the provision of adequate light and air, including, but not limited to the potential for utilization of renewable energy sources.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-4\">d. Establish, for particular uses or classes of uses, reasonable standards of performance and standards for the provision of adequate physical improvements including, but not limited to, off-street parking and loading areas, marginal access roads and roadways, other circulation facilities and water, sewerage and drainage facilities; provided that section 41 of this act <em>[N.J.S.A. </em>40:55D-53] shall apply to such improvements.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-5\">[N.J.S.A 40:55D-65a, b, d.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">Common to both the Act and the MLUL is the overriding focus on \u201cpublic health and safety.\u201d However, in the former, the standard provides a basis for limiting municipal authority, while in the latter, the standard provides the enabling authority for local regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-7\">\n<em>III.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b420-8\">Against this factual, procedural and statutory backdrop, we address the issue of preemption. Preemption is a judicially created principle based, in part, on the proposition that a municipality, as an agent of the State, cannot take action contrary to the State. <em>Summer v. Township of Teaneck, </em>53 <em>N.J. </em>548, 554, 251 A.2d 761 (1969). A municipality, therefore, may not contradict a policy established by the Legislature. <em>Ibid.; Auto-Rite Supply Co. v. Mayor of Woodbridge, </em>25 <em>N.J. </em>188, 194, 135 A.2d 515 (1957). \u201cHence an ordinance will fail if it permits what a statute expressly forbids or <em>forbids what a statute expressly authorizes.\u201d Summer, supra, </em>53 <em>N.J. </em>at 554, 251 A.2d 761 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b420-9\">It is indisputable that the doctrine of preemption may apply to local zoning ordinances. <em>See e.g., Township of Chester v. Dep\u2019t of Envtl. Prot., </em>181 <em>N.J.Super. </em>445, 453, 438 A.2d 334 (App.Div.1981) (Solid Waste Management Act preempted township\u2019s zoning ordinance with respect to construction of access road to landfill); <em>Township of Little Falls v. Bardin, </em>173 <em>N.J.Super. </em>397, 415-18, 414 A.2d 559 (App.Div.1979) (Solid Waste Management Act preempted township\u2019s zoning ordinance under which a sanitary landfill was a nonpermitted use). Just as the State <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>grants and enables municipalities\u2019 power to zone pursuant to the MLUL, it can also limit that power. As the Supreme Court observed in <em>Lusardi v. Curtis Point Property Oumers Ass\u2019n, </em>86 <em>N.J. </em>217, 430 A.2d 881 (1981):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-6\">[sltatewide policies are relevant to zoning decisions because municipalities exercise zoning power only through delegation of the State\u2019s authority and they must consider the welfare of all of the State\u2019s citizens, not just the interests of the inhabitants in the particular locality.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-7\"><em>[Id. </em>at 227, 430 A.2d 881.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b421-8\">The doctrine of preemption has also been applied to municipalities\u2019 planning and site plan approval authority. For example, we have held that the Solid Waste Management Act preempts any local requirements that the operator of a sludge management and recovery facility comply with a municipal site plan or obtain variance approval. <em>Ocean County Utils. Auth. v. Planning Bd. of Berkeley, </em>223 <em>N. J.Super. </em>461, 538 A.2d 1307 (App.Div.1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b421-9\">Guiding our analysis is the basic tenet that legislative intent to override or preempt existing legislation, especially that favoring local authority, must be clearly present. <em>See Summer, supra, </em>53 <em>N.J. </em>at 554, 251 A.2d 761; <em>Kennedy v. City of Newark, </em>29 <em>N.J. </em>178, 187, 148 A.2d 473 (1959). The structure of the amended Act provides insight into resolution of the issue. The amended Act explicitly preempts municipal regulation of various commercial agricultural activities which meet certain eligibility criteria. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>4:lC-9. Specifically, all of the activities listed in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>4:lC-9(a) through (h) are to be allowed \u201c[njotwithstanding the provisions of any municipal or county ordinance, resolution, or regulation to the contrary,\u201d provided they are in accordance with a \u201cgenerally accepted agricultural operation or practice\u201d as determined by the SADC. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>4:1C-9.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-10\">The amended Act also expanded upon and formalized the procedure by which farming operations involving the activities listed in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>4:lC-9(a) through (h) may be deemed \u201cto constitute a generally accepted agricultural operation or practice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Whereas the pre-amendment Act simply identified an \u201cacceptable agricultural operation or practice\u201d as one which \u201cconforms to agricul<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>tural management practices <em>recommended </em>by the [SADC],\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>4:lC-9 (amended 1998) (emphasis added), the amended Act sets forth specific procedures for determining whether agricultural operations are entitled to the protections of the Act. First, the amended Act authorizes the SADC to define accepted agricultural management practices through a formal rulemaking process. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>4:lC-9. Where no rules exist, site-specific practices can be approved on a case-by-case basis by the CAB, or, where no such board exists, by the SADC. <em>Id. </em>Where a CAB recommends a site-specific agricultural management practice, an appeal can be taken to the SADC. <em>N.J.S.A </em>4:1C-10.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">We find further support for preemption by noting that in <em>Villari, supra, </em>we observed that among other examples of explicit preemption, the preemptive language in the New Jersey Building Authority Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:18A-78.1 to -78.32, demonstrated the clear intent necessary to establish preemption. 277 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 140, 649 A.2d 98. By that Act, the Building Authority was allowed to \u201cdetermine the \u2018location, type and character\u2019 of buildings to be used by State agencies \u2018notwithstanding any land use plan [or] zoning regulation ... adopted by any municipality.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(quoting <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:18A-78.5(u)). Although the language of the amended Act may not be as explicit, it is clearly broader in scope by allowing approved agricultural uses \u201cNotwithstanding the provisions of any municipal or county ordinance, resolution, or regulation to the contrary.\u201d We conclude that the amendatory language demonstrates specific legislative intent to preempt. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>4:lC-9.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">A finding of facial preemption does not end our inquiry. We also note that the Act defines specific matters for consideration by the CAB and SADC. It is only within those statutory parameters that the agencies may assume and exercise jurisdiction; in doing so, they must also exercise discretion in a manner consistent with their charge. As such, they must act in a manner which gives appropriate consideration not only to the agricultural practice at issue, but to local ordinances and regulations as well, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>including land use regulations which may impact on the agricultural practice. It is not difficult to envision a scenario, as suggested by plaintiff here, where a commercial farm operator may seek to extend what appears to be an accepted agricultural management practice to such an extent that it is so violative of local land use ordinances as to be beyond the ken of reasonable conduct despite falling within the scope of the Act. In such instances, the CAB or SADC cannot disregard such ordinances and the impact of agricultural management practices in such context.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">Our courts have acknowledged analogous obligations in other circumstances. <em>See, e.g., Holgate Prop. Assocs. v. Township of Howell, </em>145 <em>N.J. </em>590, 601, 679 A.2d 613 (1996) (noting the administrative agency\u2019s implied duty to consider local zoning and land use regulations even where there was preemption under the Solid Waste Management Act). In <em>Garden State Farms, Inc. v. Bay, </em>77 <em>N.J. </em>439, 390 A.2d 1177 (1978), the Court addressed a similar issue in the context of a heliport facility and specifically examined the relevance of local land use ordinances:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-6\">Especially probative of the vital interests of local government is the municipal zoning ordinance itself. Indeed, the Commissioner by regulation already recognizes the importance of such interests by giving controlling weight to local ordinances in the case of applications for public use airports and private landing strips. <em>N.J.A.C. </em>16:54-1 <em>et seq.; N.J.A.C. </em>16:54-2 <em>et seq. See also Aviation, Services v. Bd. of Adj. of Hanover Twp., </em>20 <em>N.J. </em>275, 285, 119 A.2d 761 (1956); <em>Town of Bloomfield v. New Jersey Highway Auth., </em>18 <em>N.J. </em>237, 248, 113 A.2d 658 (1955). Clearly he should, at the very least, acknowledge the relevance of the local zoning ordinance with respect to applications for private heliports and helistops. To this we would add as a material consideration that the Commissioner ought to take into account whether an applicant for a private heliport has availed itself of any right to a variance under the local zoning law and whether an application for a variance should be pursued as a helpful procedure for fleshing out the impact of the proposed facility upon neighboring uses.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b423-7\"><em>[Id. </em>at 455, 390 A.2d 1177.]</p>\n<p id=\"b423-8\">The Court observed that \u201ca failure on the Commissioner\u2019s part to weigh conscientiously local interests, to examine carefully whether the proposed avigation facility is compatible with the surrounding land uses and to consult the local ordinances and authorities in making its licensing decision would constitute an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 456, 390 A.2d 1177. <em>See also </em>Cox, <em>New Jersey </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number><em>Zoning and Land Use Administration, </em>\u00a7\u00a7 21-3 to -32.2 (2000). There may be instances where a CAB or the SADC concludes that an issue is beyond the jurisdiction of the agency, that adherence to local land use ordinances is appropriate, or even that there is no preemption on a specific issue, <em>of. Shupack v. Manasquan River River Sewerage Auth., </em>194 <em>N.J.Super. </em>199, 205, 476 A.2d 816 (App.Div.1984); however, that determination shall be made by the CAB or SADC in the first instance, rather than by the municipality or a court.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-4\">While we recognize that the preemption doctrine may appear to give expansive and unlimited jurisdiction over agricultural practices to the CAB or SADC, we conclude that the legislative imperative requiring attention to public health and safety also imposes a limitation on such jurisdiction and requires the respective boards to consider the impact of municipal land use ordinances. When assessing the nature of defendants\u2019 various farm structures, land coverage, and other related matters, the use of such structures and coverage may properly be considered relevant agricultural management practices, but the impact of those practices on, for example, water run-off, stream encroachment, and the creation of impervious areas may also directly impact on public health and safety so as to compel the CAB or SADC to temper its determinations with these standards in mind. By including the issue of public health and safety as a limitation on the scope of the Act, the Legislature demonstrated an intent to impose on the CAB and SADC an obligation to consider these factors in all contexts, including relevant local land use ordinances. For example, while concrete walkways and gravel filled parking areas may fall within the statutory rubric of agricultural management practices, the CAB must consider the extent of their use and consider the limitations imposed on such uses by a municipality. We recognize that while the municipal limitations imposed on such practices may be more restrictive than those required to satisfy the standards of legitimate agricultural practices, the municipal limitations may nevertheless provide an appropriate measure for consideration by the CAB or SADC. To reiterate, an initial determination must be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>made by the agency as to whether an agricultural management practice is involved, and having determined that a subject practice is at issue, the CAB or SADC must then consider relevant municipal standards in rendering its ultimate decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">Aside from the agency\u2019s duty to consider local ordinances in general, advocacy of an aggrieved party\u2019s, including a municipality\u2019s, position on a given issue is further protected by the statute. <em>N.J.S.A </em>4:1C-I0.1a provides that \u201c[a]ny person aggrieved by the operation of a commercial farm shall file a complaint with the applicable [CAB] or the [SADC] in counties where no county board exists prior to filing an action in court.\u201d The statute provides for an appropriate hearing to determine, among other things, whether the activity in question \u201cconstitutes a generally accepted agricultural operation or practice.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>4:1C-10.1(c). <em>See also N.J.AC. </em>2:76-2.10 (establishing the hearing procedure for those aggrieved by the operation of a commercial farm). Following an adverse determination, an aggrieved party may then appeal to the SADC, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>4:1C-10.2, and then to this court for further review, <em>R. </em>2:2-3(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b425-7\">The explicit legislative purpose of the MLUL is, in part, \u201c[t]o encourage municipal action to guide the appropriate use or development of all lands in this State, in a manner which will promote the <em>public health, safety, </em>morals, and general welfare.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:55D-2a (emphasis added). Land use ordinances provide an appropriate exercise of legislative authority to promote public health and safety. <em>See, e.g., State v. C.I.B. Int\u2019l, </em>83 <em>N.J. </em>262, 270-72, 416 A.2d 362 (1980) (holding that requiring issuance of certificate of occupancy upon change in tenancy of existing dwelling was an appropriate municipal measure to insure public safety); <em>Cappture Realty Corp. v. Bd. of Adj. of Elmwood Park, </em>133 <em>N.J.Super. </em>216, 224, 336 A.2d 30 (App.Div.1975) (holding that an ordinance may forbid uses which create odor, dust, noise, smoke or gas). <em>See also, e.g., N.J.S.A. </em>40:55D-38 (setting forth appropriate considerations for subdivision or site plan approval including protection against flooding, water pollution, and other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>issues of public health and safety.) We consider that the statutory language in the Act which speaks to conduct that poses a \u201cdirect threat to public health or safety\u201d must be considered broadly, and not as a narrow limitation in considering complaints of an aggrieved party that local land use or other relevant ordinances are being violated by the conduct of the commercial farm operator. In sum, in exercising its authority under the Act, the CAB or SADC must afford a local agency comity in recognition that the municipality interests must be appropriately acknowledged and considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-4\">Applying these standards to this case, we recognize that the expansive complaint filed by plaintiff may indeed address legitimate agricultural management practices and may also address issues beyond the jurisdiction of the CAB. We need not focus on the specific allegations or the jurisdictional implications of such allegations except to reiterate that the CAB shall determine in the first instance whether and to what extent its jurisdiction extends to such allegations. If the CAB assumes jurisdiction, it must determine, among other things, whether the practices at issue present a \u201cdirect threat to public health and safety.\u201d By such consideration, the agency must harmonize the policy considerations which mandate protection for the State\u2019s agricultural industry with the important and well-recognized local control of land use development. Any relief sought by plaintiff in this matter must first be addressed to the CAB.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">Reversed and remanded for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b408-9\"> While we address the issues in this appeal in the context of preemption, we recognize that principles of primary jurisdiction and harmonizing the provisions of the Act and the MLUL are necessarily implicated. We have considered those principles as well, and intend that our use of the term \"preemption\" be understood in its broadest sense, and our decision read accordingly. Under any of these theories, the results would be the same.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b414-8\"> Defendants claim the Act \"conditionally\u201d restricts municipal zoning because the Act specifically requires buildings and parking areas associated with a farm market on commercial farm property to comply with municipal standards. <em>NJ.S.A. </em>4:lC-9(c).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b415-8\"> For a compilation of the various other state statutes and citations, see Alexander A.
