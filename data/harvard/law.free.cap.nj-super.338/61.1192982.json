(collectively, \u201cAmeriSOURCE\u201d) and Rathna Balawat (Balawat), (collectively, \u201cdefendants\u201d), seeking damages allegedly resulting from AmeriSOURCE\u2019s placement of its contract computer programmer, Balawat, directly with plaintiffs client, Alliance Funding Company (\u201cAlliance\u201d), in contravention of the parties\u2019 agreements. AmeriSOURCE defended asserting that plaintiff was barred from proceeding on its claims for failure to comply with the licencing requirements of the Private Employment Agency Act,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:8-43 to -66 (the \u201cAct\u201d). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>The motion judge granted defendants\u2019 motions for summary judgment and dismissed the complaint. Plaintiffs appeal requires us to interpret the Act to determine whether plaintiff was an employment agency subject to its licensing requirements. We conclude that plaintiff is subject to those requirements, and that its failure to comply with the Act bars it from proceeding on its cause of action. Accordingly, we affirm the dismissal of its complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">The underlying facts presented by the parties on the motions for summary judgment were not in significant dispute. Plaintiff, a Delaware Corporation with its principal place of business in Delaware, maintains \u201can office\u201d in New Jersey. AmeriSOURCE is a \u201ccomputer consulting business\u201d licensed and registered \u201cas an employment agenfcy] and placement [firm which] ... also do[es] project management.\u201d Both companies \u201cengage[ ] in the business of placement of contract personnel within other entities\u201d as computer services consultants. Balawat is a computer programmer who entered into a one-year minimum employment contract with AmeriSOURCE on January 16, 1997, agreeing to work as an on-site computer software consultant for AmeriSOURCE or any of its direct or indirect clients. That contract contained comprehensive non-competition clauses which prohibited Balawat\u2019s concurrent or subsequent employment with any of AmeriSOURCE\u2019s clients for a period of one year after leaving AmeriSOURCE\u2019s employ, unless AmeriSOURCE gave explicit written permission to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">On April 18,1997, plaintiffs predecessor in contract and AmeriSOURCE entered into an agreement and work order for \u201cthe supply of [Balawat] for programming services to [plaintiff],\u201d commencing at the \u201cend-client,\u201d Alliance, on April 21, 1997. That is, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>\u201c[pjlaintiff ... placed [AmeriSOURCE\u2019s] employee, Balawat, at Alliance.\u201d In conjunction with the work order, plaintiff and AmeriSOURCE also entered into a \u201cMaster Service Contract\u201d whereby AmeriSOURCE agreed to supply plaintiff with employees to meet plaintiffs requirements. We quote relevant portions of the contract:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-5\">A SCOPE</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A2f\">A.1 General</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-6\">[Plaintiff] agrees to hire contract personnel from AmeriSOURCE as and when required by [plaintiff], and AmeriSOURCE hereby agrees to provide contract personnel to [plaintiff] as and when required by [plaintiff].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-7\">B WORK ORDER &amp; PROJECT</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-8\">As and when contract personnel are actually assigned by AmeriSOURCE to work for [plaintiff] on specific projects, a WORK ORDER (as per enclosed format Appendix A) shall be signed by both parties for every contract person. All such Work Orders shall be considered an integral part of this Agreement. Each Work Order shall constitute a Project.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-9\">C EMPLOYMENT STATUS OF CONTRACT PERSONNEL</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-10\">\n<em>All contract personnel employed or contracted, by AmeriSOURCE and assigned to work for [plaintiff] shall at all times during the term of this contract and for the period specified in the restrictive covenants, be employees of AmeriSOURCE ... and not of [plaintiff].</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-11\">Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement, should AmeriSOURCE fail to ensure prompt payment of wages and fees to contract personnel then assigned to plaintiff, the latter may at its election contract directly with the said contract personnel for the continued performance of the services then being provided.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-12\">J RESTRICTIVE COVENANT</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-13\">J.l AmeriSOURCE agrees that, during the term of this Agreement or any renewal thereof and for a period of l(one) calendar year after the completion of the contracted services, AmeriSOURCE will not solicit, enter into agreement with or assign contract personnel to [plaintiffs] clients with whom [AmeriSOURCE\u2019s] contract personnel have been introduced by interview or placement, unless [plaintiff] grants the proper authorization in writing to waive this provision.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>J.4 [The terms of J.l] shall survive the termination of the Agreement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-4\">M OBLIGATIONS OF CONTRACT PERSONNEL</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-5\">M.1 AmeriSOURCE shall be required to make all contract personnel assigned to [plaintiffs] projects by way of this Agreement, aware of the provisions of this Agreement which affect or obligate the contract personnel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-6\">M.2 AmeriSOURCE shall be required to obtain in writing the contract personnel\u2019s acceptance of the provisions referred to in [M.l] above. This will be obtained in the form of a statement similar to the format enclosed as Appendix B.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-7\">N LEGAL STANDING</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-8\">N.2 [Plaintiff] hereby declares ... that it has complied with all Federal State and Local laws regarding business permits and licenses that may be required in order to conduct business, in general, and to carry out the work stated in this Agreement; that it is qualified to conduct business in all jurisdictions in which the nature of the business contemplated by this Agreement requires such qualification; and, that it currently enjoys the legal standing necessary in order to enter into this Agreement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-9\">[ (Emphasis added). ]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b98-10\">The parties\u2019 work order and agreement set forth the method of Balawat\u2019s compensation. Balawat commenced working at Alliance on April 21, 1997, and thereafter submitted weekly time sheets to plaintiff, who then invoiced Alliance at an hourly rate for Balawat\u2019s services; Alliance paid plaintiff, who then retained a portion of the payments and forwarded the remainder to AmeriSOURCE; AmeriSOURCE then retained its respective share of the payments, and compensated Balawat pursuant to her employment agreement with AmeriSOURCE. AmeriSOURCE was also responsible for withholding and paying Balawat\u2019s applicable federal, state, and miscellaneous taxes, as well as for paying her liability and workers\u2019 compensation insurance premiums.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-11\">In February 1998, plaintiff stopped receiving time sheets from Balawat, and upon inquiry to AmeriSOURCE concerning her employment status, ultimately received a letter from AmeriSOURCE dated July 16,1998, which stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>To Whom It May Concern:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-5\">Effective June 22, 1998, [AmeriSOURCE] releases Ms. Rathna Balawat of NR Tech Corp. from the contract dated February 20, 1998 to accept employment with Larry Bernardo &amp; Company. This is a general waiver of the non-compete clause in our contract of February 20,1998.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">Although this letter does not reference the employment contract of January 16, 1997 between Balawat and AmeriSOURCE, plaintiff asserts that this letter \u201cconfirmfed] that Balawat had resigned from [AmeriSOURCE] and that [AmeriSOURCE] released her from her obligations under the [January 16] Employment Agreement, including the non-compete provision\u201d of Balawat\u2019s agreement with AmeriSOURCE.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-7\">Plaintiff filed a complaint against defendants seeking money judgment and other relief for damages sustained as a result of AmeriSOURCE\u2019s alleged breach of contract (Count One), Balawat\u2019s alleged breach of a restrictive covenant (Count Two), and both defendants\u2019 alleged tortious interference with plaintiffs contract and economic advantage (Counts Three and Four), breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing (Count Five), and unjust enrichment (Count Six).</p>\n<p id=\"b99-8\">Plaintiff claimed that both plaintiff and AmeriSOURCE were \u201cengaged in the business of placement of contract personnel within other entities,\u201d and that pursuant to the parties\u2019 agreement, AmeriSOURCE supplied Balawat to plaintiff, who then \u201cplaced\u201d her with its client, Alliance, to provide computer programming services. Plaintiff also claims that it never received an executed copy of Balawat\u2019s required agreement not to compete, that Balawat\u2019s alleged February 18, 1998 letter of resignation to AmeriSOURCE was delivered to plaintiff when Balawat stopped submitting her time sheets from her job at Alliance, and that \u201cupon information and belief,\u201d Balawat continued to work at Alliance, and AmeriSOURCE placed other employees there, both in violation of the parties\u2019 master service contract. Obviously, plaintiff never identified itself as a licensed or registered employment agency under the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>Following service of the complaint, defendants moved to dismiss asserting, among other defenses, plaintiffs failure to comply with the Act. That motion was denied and an answer was filed. Thereafter, AmeriSOURCE and Balawat moved for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">In opposing the motions, plaintiff provided the certifications of its president, Rekha Chandarana (Chandarana), and its vice-president, Surindar Mohan Malhan (Malhan). Chandarana stated that plaintiff was not an employment agency subject to the Act, was \u201cnot in the business of placing employees,\u201d and did not seek to collect \u201ca fee, commission or charge for placing employees.\u201d Rather, plaintiff was engaged in the \u201cProject Management\u201d of implementing its clients\u2019 specific computer programming needs, and had been hired by Alliance to manage a programming project \u201c[bjecause Alliance did not have an employee in-house who could [do so].\u201d \u201cAs [plaintiff] did not then have an employee available to be assigned to work on the Alliance Project, [it] sought the services of a consulting company [AmeriSOURCE,] to provide [plaintiff] with a consultant to work on the Alliance Project on [plaintiffs] behalf.\u201d AmeriSOURCE then provided Balawat to plaintiff, who, in turn, assigned her to \u201cthe Alliance Project.\u201d In sum, Chandarana claimed plaintiffs business consisted not of \u201cfinding job placements for people,\u201d but of \u201cmanaging] its clients\u2019 computer projects,\u201d and it \u201cwas not paid a fee to place Balawat,\u201d but rather was paid for its \u201cproject management services [at] an agreed hourly rate\u201d \u201cbased on the amount of time Balawat worked on the Alliance Project.\u201d Plaintiff in turn, paid AmeriSOURCE \u201cfor the use of Balawat\u2019s services\u201d on the project. Chandarana also asserted that Balawat\u2019s letter of resignation from AmeriSOURCE was \u201cfalse,\u201d and that she \u201ccontinued to provide services to the Alliance Project after the date of her \u2018resignation\u2019, but directly or indirectly to AmeriSOURCE, who had misappropriated [plaintiffs] client\u201d and also \u201cplaced other ... employees directly at Alliance in derogation of ... the Master Service Contract.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b101-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>According to Malhan, George Balinsky of Alliance called him \u201cseeking assistance regarding the technical aspects of a project ... because the then current manager, Larry Bernardo, was not there full-time at their New Jersey location.\u201d Plaintiff \u201ccontracted with Alliance to provide ... Balawat to provide the technical services Alliance required of her.\u201d Malhan opined that defendants were \u201ctrying to get away with stealing [plaintiffs] business,\u201d and that \u201cBernardo [was] a participant in their plan.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">In support of their summary judgment motions, AmeriSOURCE and Balawat relied on the certifications of Balawat, AmeriSOURCE\u2019s principal, Probal Dasgupta (Dasgupta), William C. Bracken, CFO of Alliance\u2019s parent company, and Larry Bernardo, principal of his own company and the contract project manager responsible for designing and implementing the subject computer program for Alliance.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">Balawat certified that while she was under contract with AmeriSOURCE, an employment agency, she was placed at Alliance by plaintiff, another employment agency, pursuant to industry custom, after plaintiff arranged for her interview with Alliance and presented her with Alliance\u2019s subsequent job offer. She also stated that the programming project she worked on at Alliance had commenced well prior to her placement there, and that she was exclusively supervised and controlled by Alliance\u2019s project manager, Larry Bernardo. In sum, she claimed that plaintiff had only placed her at Alliance, and had never been responsible for the management or oversight of her work or the Alliance programming project.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-7\">Dasgupta confirmed Balawat\u2019s statements, and further offered that plaintiff had merely \u201cacted as an employment agency\u201d by placing Balawat at Alliance, had never engaged in software design or \u201cProject Management\u201d at Alliance, and had no employees or supervisors there. He noted that plaintiff \u201cwas paid ... only when [AmeriSOURCE] supplied Balawat to [plaintiff] to be placed with Alliance by [plaintiff],\u201d and was therefore \u201cseeking to recover from defendants the fee, charge or commission [plaintiff] would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>have earned had [it] continued to place Balawat ... and the other alleged employees with Alliance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">Bracken and Bernardo also confirmed this version of events, certifying that Bernardo was and had been the exclusive computer programming project manager for Alliance\u2019s project since its inception, that plaintiff never had any agreement, contract, or responsibility for technical input or project management on Alliance\u2019s project, and that plaintiff, upon inquiry by Alliance\u2019s George Belinsky, merely placed Balawat as a programmer to meet Alliance\u2019s needs as determined by Bernardo.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-7\">Plaintiff conceded that: (1) the only document evidencing any type of agreement between plaintiff and Alliance concerning Balawat\u2019s placement was \u201ca purchase order type of document,\u201d; (2) its compensation from Alliance was not a \u201cmanagement fee,\u201d but rather a share of Balawat\u2019s hourly wages; (3) its damages would therefore be measured by its \u201clost\u201d share of Balawat\u2019s earnings at Alliance plus a share of the earnings of any employee AmeriSOURCE might place there; and (4) there was no project management contract between plaintiff and Alliance, and Bernardo supervised the project\u2019s programmers.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-8\">Judge Rebeck granted summary judgment to defendants, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-9\">I think we\u2019ve gone around this over and over again. I\u2019m satisfied that the ... employment agency statute 34:8-43 applies here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-10\">I\u2019m satisfied from the evidence that ... [plaintiff] was not the project manager. I\u2019m satisfied ... that Larry Bernardo was hired by Alliance Funding to manage this project, to supervise the project, to run the project two years before [Balawat] ever came on board.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-11\">I\u2019m satisfied that Larry Bernardo needed somebody. [Balawat] was an employee of AmeriSOURCE who is an employment agency. Plaintiff didn\u2019t have anybody to they went to AmeriSOURCE, got [Balawat], and sent [Balawat] over ... to serve in the capacity used.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-12\">Whether you look at this as an employment agency or if you look at it as a temporary help service-I\u2019m satisfied that the Statute applies. Clearly, and that\u2019s why it was so important for me to get an answer [to] the very first question I asked and that is what [are] your damages, how do you compute your damages, ... you compute your damages by what you\u2019ve lost by not getting the money for using [Balawat], and you also are losing money for not giving them other possible <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>employees of your\u2019s or someone else\u2019s for which you would reap some sort of a financial benefit. You don\u2019t want to call it a commission, you want to call [it] a fee, fine, whatever you want to call it. You look at the vouchers and how did [plaintiff] get its money. Well, it was [Balawat\u2019s] service that was rendered art] X number of dollars and from that money it was divvied up and [plaintiff] got its share for ... this woman . doing her job at the premises.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-6\">Whether it\u2019s fair or not the Statute is clear, the Statute says if you fall within ... one of the categories in the Statute you have to be licensed or registered. If you\u2019re not licensed or registered at the time the cause of action arose, you can\u2019t collect.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b103-7\">Having abandoned its claim of serving as \u201cproject manager\u201d on appeal, plaintiff contends that the motion judge erred in granting summary judgment to AmeriSOURCE because: (1) plaintiff is not an \u201cemployment agency,\u201d but rather a \u201ctemporary help service firm\u201d exempt from the requirements of the Act; (2) even if plaintiff were an employment agency, the Act would not preclude its contract and tort claims; (3) even if the Act applied and precluded plaintiffs claims, the judge abused his discretion by failing to take \u201cequitable considerations\u201d into account; and (4) genuine issues of material fact precluded summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-8\">In addressing the arguments raised by plaintiff, we first review the Act, its purpose, and its relevant provisions. The Act provides for the Division of Consumer Affairs\u2019 regulation and oversight of mandated practices, licensing, and registration requirements for private agencies which provide employment services, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:8-53 to 8-63; <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:17B-139.4 to-139.6, and prohibits regulated agencies from engaging in \u201cdeceptive or otherwise unfair practices when dealing with both job seekers and employers,\u201d A. 3018, 203rd Leg., 2d Sess., 1989 N.J. Sess. Law Serv. 331 (West) (Introductory Statement). It applies to \u201cany person engaging in any of the activities regulated by th[e] [A]ct including persons whose residence or principal place of business is located outside of ... [New Jersey].\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:8-45a; <em>N.J.A.C. </em>13:45B-l.l(b).

The employment agency licensing requirements are not insignificant, and reflect a legislative scheme to insure that those engaged in the industry are well-qualified and of good moral character. <em>See, e.g., N.J.S.A. </em>34:8-44, -47 and <em>N.J AC. </em>13:45B-2.1, -2.6(a)2, 2.7(b)2 (requiring license applicant\u2019s comprehensive disclosure statements, including criminal convictions disclosure and independent affidavits attesting to applicant\u2019s good moral character); <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:8-48 and <em>N.J.A.C. </em>13:45B-2.6(a) (requiring, <em>among </em>other things, that license applicants pass a written examination demonstrating knowledge of the Act\u2019s requirements and sufficient knowledge necessary to qualify as an employment agent); <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:8-49 <em>and N.J AC. </em>13.45B 2.3 (requiring agency license applicant to post $10,000 bond); <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:8-51, and <em>N.J.A.C. </em>13:45B-2.2, -2.4, -2.5, 2.8 (delineating various fee schedule and record-keeping requirements). In addition, out-of-State entities required to be licensed or registered under the Act must also register the name and address of a designated New Jersey agent \u201cfor service of process and other matters.\u201d <em>N.J.A.C. </em>13:45B-8.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>Plaintiffs claim that it is not an \u201cemployment agency\u201d is based on its assertion that it did not engage in activities within the statutory definition of \u201cemployment agency,\u201d and that its activities were therefore outside the scope of the Act. In discerning the meaning and applicability of statutory provisions, we are mindful of the admonition to look to the purpose and language of legislation as the \u201csurest indicator of the Legislature\u2019s intent.\u201d <em>Mayfield v. Cmty. Med. </em>Assocs., 335 <em>N.J.Super. </em>198, 204-05, 762 A.2d 237 (App.Div.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">An \u201cemployment agency\u201d is defined as \u201cany person who, for a fee, charge or commission\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-7\">(1) Procures or obtains, or offers, promises or attempts to procure, obtain, or assist in procuring or obtaining employment for a job seeker or employees for an employer; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-8\">(2) Supplies job seekers to employers seeking employees on a part-time or temporary assignment basis who has not filed notification with the Attorney General pursuant to the provisions of <em>[N.J.S.A </em>56:8-1.1]; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-9\">(4) Acts as a placement firm____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-10\"><em>[N.J.S.A. </em>34:8-43(1), (2), (4); <em>N.J.A.C. </em>13:45B-1.2.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b106-11\">The Supreme Court defined the purpose of the Act in <em>Accountemps Division of Robert Half of Philadelphia, Inc. v. Birch Tree Group, Ltd., </em>115 <em>N.J. </em>614, 560 A.2d 663 (1989). It is \u201cabundantly clear to one examining the entire statutory scheme ... that the Legislature\u2019s primary purpose in adopting the ... Act was to regulate the conduct of <em>all </em>employment agencies providing services to New Jersey employees and employers.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 623, 560 A.2d 663 (emphasis added). \u201cIt would frustrate that purpose\u201d to construe the Act to require agencies which readily acknowledge the nature of their activities and the consequent applicability of the Act to be subject to comprehensive regulation, while allowing agencies which carry on those same activities under color of artful nomenclature to deny the applicability of the Act and \u201ccarry on business in this State completely unregulated.\u201d <em>See ibid. </em>\u201cThe Act is a regulatory measure intended to alleviate abuses in the employment-agency industry. With this remedial purpose in mind, the Legislature required the licensing of all entities that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>\u2018perform any of the functions of an employment agency.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ibid. </em>(quoting former <em>N.J.S.A </em>34:8-26, now codified at <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:8-47, -48).</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">A careful analysis of the Act as applied to plaintiffs activities demonstrates that plaintiffs conduct falls within the proscribed unregulated practices described by the Court in <em>Accountemps. </em>The definitions provided by the Act are helpful. An \u201cemployer\u201d is defined as \u201ca person seeking to obtain individuals to perform services, tasks, or labor for which a salary, wage, or other compensation or benefits are to be paid,\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:8-43, but, for purposes of the Act, an employment agency is not an \u201cemployer,\u201d except of its own employment agents, <em>N.J.A.C. </em>13:45B1.2. A \u201cjob seeker\u201d is \u201cany individual seeking employment ... or employment related services or products.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A </em>34:8-43; <em>N.J.A.C. </em>13:45B-1.2. Although not defined by the statute, \u201cemployee\u201d and \u201cplacement firm\u201d must be given their ordinary and well-understood meanings. <em>N.J.S.A </em>1:1-1; <em>Alan J. Cornblatt, P.A v. Barow, </em>153 <em>N.J. </em>218, 231, 708 A.2d 401 (1998); <em>Hubbard v. Reed, </em>331 <em>N.J.Super. </em>283, 290, 751 A.2d 1055 (App.Div.), <em>certif. granted, </em>165 <em>N.J. </em>527, 760 A.2d 781 (2000). \u201cEmployee\u201d is commonly defined as \u201c[a] person in the service of another under any contract of hire, express or implied, oral or written, where the employer has the power or right to control and direct the employee in the material details of how the work is to be performed.\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>471 (5th ed.1979). <em>See also Conestoga Title Ins. Co. v. Premier Title Agency, Inc., </em>328 <em>N.J.Super. </em>460, 746 A.2d 462, (App.Div.), <em>aff'd, </em>166 <em>N.J. </em>2, 763 A.2d 746 (2000) (defining employee as \u201cpersonf ] whom you have the right to direct and control while performing services for you\u201d). \u201cPlacement\u201d is commonly defined as \u201c[t]he act of finding employment for a person as in the case of an employment agency,\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary, supra, </em>at 1034. The common meaning of the provision\u2019s remaining terms are readily apparent, and not \u201cso unusual or subtle [as] to \u2018send the average citizen scrambling for a dictionary.\u2019 \u201d <em>Binkowski v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number><em>State, </em>322 <em>N.J.Super. </em>359, 382, 731 A.2d 64 (App.Div.1999) (quoting <em>State v. Afanador, </em>134 <em>N.J. </em>162, 171, 631 A.2d 946 (1993)).</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">The factual scenario described by plaintiff in response to the motions for summary judgment provides a sufficient basis for demonstrating plaintiffs susceptibility to the Act\u2019s requirements. Plaintiff procured an AmeriSOURCE employee, Balawat, and placed her with plaintiffs client, Alliance. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:8-43(1). Alliance was obviously an \u201cemployer,\u201d as it contacted plaintiff seeking to obtain an employee to perform services for which wages were to be paid. <em>N.J.S.A </em>34:8-43. Balawat was an \u201cemployee\u201d of Alliance, as plaintiff conceded that Alliance alone, through Bernardo, controlled and directed her in the material details of how her work was to be performed. Plaintiff received a \u201cfee, charge, or commission\u201d by direct payment of that portion of Balawat\u2019s wages from Alliance to plaintiff which plaintiff retained for its service of procuring and providing Balawat to Alliance. Plaintiffs activities meet the plain language definition of an \u201cemployment agency\u201d governed by the Act under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:8-43(1). The totality of plaintiffs conduct is most telling. It arranged the interview with Alliance, supplied Balawat to Alliance, and was compensated based on a percentage of Balawat\u2019s wages. Plaintiffs role in the transaction, no matter how self-described by plaintiff, is well within the scope and purview of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-7\">We reject plaintiffs additional claim that it was a temporary help service agency exempt from the Act\u2019s provisions. A review of the relevant provisions dispels the validity of that argument. A \u201ctemporary help service firm\u201d is defined as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-8\">any person who operates a business which consists of [1] employing individuals directly or indirectly for the purpose of assigning the employed individuals to assist the firm\u2019s customers in the handling of the customers\u2019 temporary, excess or special work loads, <em>and </em>[2] who, in addition to the payment of wages or salaries to the employed individuals, pays federal social security taxes and State and federal unemployment insurance; carries worker\u2019s compensation insurance as required by State law; <em>and </em>[3] sustains responsibility for the actions of the employed individuals while they render services to the firm\u2019s customers. A temporary help service firm is required to comply with the provisions of ... [the Consumer Fraud Act, <em>N.J.S.A </em>56:8-1 to -97],</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AMi\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number><em>[N.J.S.A. </em>34:8-43 (emphasis added). <em>See also N.J.A.C. </em>13:45B-1.2. (\u201cThis definition applies to \u201ctemporary help service firm\u201d as the term is used in both <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:8-43 et seq. and <em>N.J.S.A. </em>56:8-1.1.\u201d) ]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b109-6\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:8-46 provides, in pertinent part, that the provisions of the Act \u201cshall not apply to:\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-7\">h. Any temporary help service firm which does not:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-8\">(1) Charge a fee or liquidated charge to any individual employed by the firm or in connection with employment by the firm;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-9\">(2) Prevent or inhibit, by contract, any of the individuals it employs from becoming employed by any other person.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-10\"><em>[N.J.S.A. </em>34:8-46h(l), (2).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b109-11\">We first observo that although plaintiff now contends that it \u201cemployed Balawat indirectly through [defendant to assist [pjlaintiffs customer (Alliance) with Alliance\u2019s temporary, excess work load,\u201d plaintiffs prior claims are the polar opposite. Both in its complaint and in opposition to the motion for summary judgment, plaintiff alleged that Balawat was not its employee, a position contrary to the very employment relationship it now seeks to demonstrate.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-12\">At oral argument, plaintiff claimed that it \u201cindirectly\u201d employed Balawat, thus exempting it from the registration requirements of the Act. However, the record supports only one conclusion, that AmeriSOURCE alone was responsible both for paying Balawat\u2019s wages and associated taxes and for providing her with workers\u2019 compensation insurance coverage. Plaintiffs assertion that it fulfilled the \u201cwage paying\u201d provision of the Act by paying Balawat \u201cindirectly\u201d is pure sophistry: the statute does not contemplate \u201cindirect\u201d payments, as that interpretation would eviscerate the meaning and substance of the Act. The protection of the Act would become a mere shadow if plaintiffs methodology fell within the exception to the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-13\">Finally, despite plaintiffs now-abandoned claims of having served as \u201cproject manager\u201d for Alliance\u2019s programming project, we perceive that no rational fact-finder could conclude that plaintiff had either served as the programming project manager for Alliance or had supervised or otherwise \u201csustained responsibility\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>for Balawat\u2019s programming services to Alliance. <em>R. </em>4:46-2(b), <em>Brill v. Guardian Life Ins. Co. of Am., </em>142 <em>N.J. </em>520, 540, 666 A.2d 146 (1995); <em>Graziano v. Grant, </em>326 <em>N.J.Super. </em>328, 338, 741 A.2d 156 (App.Div.1999). We recognize that the concept of responsibility in the context of the circumstances presented here maybe more broadly viewed than day-to-day supervision, but there is nothing to suggest that plaintiffs \u201cresponsibility\u201d for Balawat\u2019s services amounted to anything more than a report as to her earnings. That falls well short of the \u201cresponsibility\u201d envisioned by the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">In sum, we conclude that even if plaintiff were a \u201ctemporary help service firm,\u201d it could not prevail as: (1) the statutory exemption from the Act\u2019s requirements for certain temporary help service firms does not apply to plaintiff because it charged a fee in connection with Balawat\u2019s employment and inhibited Balawat from becoming employed by Alliance by virtue of the \u201cMaster Service Contract,\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:8-46h(1), (2); (2) plaintiff violated the Act by failing to register as a temporary help service firm, <em>N.J.S.A 34:8-521, </em>-52o; <em>N.J.S.A </em>56:8-1.1; and (3) plaintiff is barred from collecting any fee, charge, or commission associated with its activities because it did not allege, and cannot prove, that it was registered as a temporary help service firm at the time its alleged causes of action arose, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:8-45b.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">We find no merit to plaintiffs alternative argument that even if its collection of a fee is barred by its failure to be licensed or registered, it is not precluded from recovering on its tort and contract claims. The argument is disingenuous and contrary to the regulatory scheme designed to preclude unlicensed agencies or services from benefitting from unlawful conduct. Because the Act is \u201cregulatory and penal\u201d in nature, any agreement between plaintiff and Alliance, and the agreements between plaintiff and AmeriSOURCE for Balawat\u2019s placement and to supply plaintiff with AmeriSOURCE employees to meet plaintiffs requirements are void as illegal, and unenforceable as a matter of public policy. <em>Accountemps, </em>115 <em>N.J. </em>at 626, 560 A.2d 663 (collecting eases where failure to comply with licensing statutes precluded contract <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>enforcement and recovery of fees); <em>Nitta v. Yamamoto, </em>31 <em>N. J.Super. </em>578, 584, 107 A.2d 515 (App.Div.1954) (holding restrictive covenant unenforceable where plaintiff failed to obtain employment agency license); <em>Saks Theatrical Agency v. Mentine, </em>24 <em>N.J. Misc. </em>332, 333, 48 A.2d 644 (Dist.Ct.1946). We will certainly not countenance plaintiff seeking to do by indirection, that which it cannot do directly, R.A. <em>Intile Realty Co., Inc. v. F.P. Raho, </em>259 <em>N.J.Super. </em>438, 474, 614 A.2d 167 (Law Div.1992) (quoting <em>Smith v. Cyprus Indus. Minerals Co., </em>178 <em>N. J.Super. </em>7, 14, 427 A.2d 1114 (App.Div.1981)); <em>McCann v. Biss, </em>65 <em>N.J. </em>301, 310, 322 A.2d 161 (1974), especially in the face of a significant regulatory scheme designed to protect not only employees and employers, but the public as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">Finally, we reject plaintiffs argument that pursuant to <em>Accountemps, </em>we should apply equitable principles permitting plaintiff to proceed despite its failure to comply with the Act. <em>Accountemps </em>is inapposite to plaintiff\u2019s case. In <em>Accountemps, </em>the Supreme Court departed from federal case law construing a prior version of the Act as inapplicable to out-of-state agencies, <em>Robert T. Winzinger, Inc. v. Mgmt. Recruiters of Bucks County, Inc., </em>841 <em>F.2d </em>497 (3d Cir.1988), and held that the Act applied to all out-of-state agencies doing business in New Jersey. <em>Accountemps, supra, </em>115 <em>N.J. </em>at 621-23, 560 A.2d 663. However, in applying that holding to plaintiff, a licensed Pennsylvania agency which sought to recover damages for unpaid fees from a New Jersey client, the Court held that it would be inequitable under the unique circumstances of that case to apply the Act retrospectively to plaintiff because the decision embodied a new principle of law and enforcement of the licensing requirement in that instance would cause unreasonable surprise and prejudice to plaintiff. <em>Id. </em>at 627-28, 560 A.2d 663.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-7\">The Act has been applicable to in-state agencies since its inception in 1951, <em>id. </em>at 619, 560 A.2d 663, and to out-of-state agencies since 1989, <em>id. </em>at 623, 560 A.2d 663; P.L.1989, c. 331, \u00a7 4. While we appreciate plaintiffs argument that enforcement of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>Act should not benefit alleged wrongdoers, ultimately, we must balance that concern against a legislative mandate which precludes otherwise possibly meritorious causes of action in order to insure enforcement of-a statutory scheme which serves the greater good. Such legislative trade-offs are not unknown, and where well-grounded in legitimate public policy considerations, will be enforced. Thus, eliminating the consideration that AmeriSOURCE may not be held responsible for its alleged misdeeds, we perceive no equities which run in plaintiffs favor. Those equitable considerations generated by a change in the applicability of the Act in <em>Accountemps </em>are not relevant to plaintiffs case.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">We hold that plaintiffs failure to comply with the licensing and registration requirements of the Act bar it from pursuing any claim for compensation, whether couched as fees in contract or damages in tort. We thus conclude that Judge Rebeck properly granted summary judgment dismissing plaintiffs complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b95-13\"> For historical purposes and completeness, we note that although the former Act <em>(L. </em>1951, <em>c. </em>337; <em>L. </em>1981, <em>c. </em>500 \u00a7 6) was repealed and substituted by <em>L. </em>1989, <em>c. </em>331, \u00a7 28, effective Jan. 12, 1990, and is no longer titled, we have retained the source act title for simplicity of discussion.
