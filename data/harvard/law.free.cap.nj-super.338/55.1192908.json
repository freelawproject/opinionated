Plaintiff Camden Fire Insurance Association appeals from a judgment of the Law Division determining that the \u201cexcess-escape\u201d provision of its UIM coverage and that of defendant Allstate Insurance Company required that a claim brought by Kenneth Adler, plaintiffs insured, be pro-rated between plaintiff and defendant. The trial judge rejected plaintiffs assertion that its UIM coverage was excess to defendant\u2019s UIM coverage. We reverse and conclude that under <em>Magnifico v. Rutgers Casualty Insurance Co., </em>153 <em>N.J. </em>406, 710 A.2d 412 (1998), and our earlier decision in <em>Di Ciurcio v. Liberty Mutual Insurance Co., </em>299 <em>N.J.Super. </em>426, 691 A.2d 396 (App.Div.1997), defendant\u2019s policy provides primary coverage to Adler and plaintiffs policy is excess.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-11\">This litigation arises as a result of a tragic automobile accident resulting in the death of two teenagers and injuries to others involved in the accident. At the time of the accident, Kenneth Adler, then age fifteen, was a passenger in an automobile owned by Barry L. and Ronnie Feinberg. This vehicle (the host vehicle) was operated by the Feinberg\u2019s son Andrew and insured by defendant. At the time of the accident, Kenneth was being driven to his home where he resided with his parents Bruce and Janet Adler. The Adlers owned a vehicle which was insured by plaintiff. As the Feinberg vehicle was stopped to make a turn, it was struck <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>in the rear by a van operated by Sandy Chin and owned by Soon Fat Noodle Co. After it was struck by the Chin vehicle, the Feinberg vehicle was struck by another vehicle owned and operated by Sung Jun Hong. Both Andrew Feinberg and another passenger in the Feinberg vehicle, Andrew Strasser, died as a result of the accident. Kenneth Adler suffered personal injuries. Four tort actions were filed as a result of the accident, and we are advised that three have settled.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">Plaintiff asserts that defendant is the primary coverage carrier since the \u201cexcess-escape\u201d provision of defendant\u2019s policy addressing \u201cother insurance\u201d is not operative when its insured vehicle is the host vehicle involved in the accident. Plaintiff concedes that its \u201cexcess-escape\u201d language is essentially the same, but argues that its responsibility is excess to defendant\u2019s primary coverage. We agree that both our decision in <em>Di Ciurcio, supra, </em>299 <em>N.J.Super. </em>426, 691 A.2d 396, and that of the Supreme Court in <em>Magnifico supra, </em>153 <em>N.J. </em>406, 710 A.2d 412, support this view. The issues before us require that we examine the language of the policies at issue.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>Although he did not delineate the policy language, the trial judge concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-6\">given the \u201cother insurance\u201d clause of the policies in question that the Adler claim must be pro rated as between Allstate and Camden. The court further finds that given the fact that in addition to the Adler claims the Allstate policy has two additional claims against it, the pro ration will be on the balance remaining on the policy after the two other claims have been satisfied.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b90-7\">We disagree with the conclusion reached by the trial judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-8\">In Magnifico, <em>supra, </em>the Supreme Court held, under policy language similar to that of the provisions at issue here, that the host vehicle coverage was primary and the injured party\u2019s own coverage was excess to the primary coverage. 153 <em>N.J. </em>at 416, 710 A.2d 412. <em>See also Royal Ins. Co. v. Rutgers Cas. Ins. Co., </em>271 <em>N.J.Super. </em>409, 419-20, 638 A.2d 924 (App.Div.1994). We recently discussed the holding in <em>Magnifico </em>in <em>Hallion v. Liberty Mutual Insurance Co., </em>337 <em>N.J.Super. </em>360, 369, 766 A.2d 1224 (App.Div.2001):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>In <em>Magnifico, </em>the Court addressed the issue of UIM coverage under multiple insurance policies.... [PJlaintiff and her husband were passengers in a car owned and driven by Grace DeNichilo. The DeNichilo vehicle collided with a vehicle driven by Frank Cameron and owned by Beverly Manning. The Manning vehicle was insured by [a] State Farm Policy with a liability limit of $25,000.00. CSC Insurance Company insured the DeNiehilo\u2019s car and provided UIM coverage of $250,000.00. Plaintiffs own automobile policy was with Rutgers Casualty Insurance Company which provided UIM coverage of $100,000.00. Plaintiffs insurance policy provided a standard \u201cother insurance\u201d clause which stated \u201cany insurance we provide with respect to a vehicle you do not own shall be excess over any other collectible insurance.\u201d Applying the clear and unambiguous language of the insurance contract, the Court held that the CSC policy provided primary coverage and the Rutgers policy provided excess coverage.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-6\"><em>[Ibid, </em>(citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b91-7\"><em>Hallion </em>involved facts similar to those in <em>Magnifico </em>and this appeal. In <em>Hallion, </em>plaintiff was injured while driving in an automobile owned by her daughter and insured by CNA. <em>Id. </em>at 863, 766 A.2d 1224. Plaintiff had her own policy issued by Liberty Mutual. <em>Ibid. </em>The minimal liability coverage on the tortfeasor\u2019s vehicle triggered the respective policies\u2019 UIM coverage. <em>Ibid. </em>Applying <em>Magnifico, </em>we concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-8\">Liberty Mutual\u2019s policy provided to plaintiffs contained the standard \u201cother insurance\u201d clause similar to the policy in <em>Magnifico, </em>and the CSC policy of the host vehicle provided UIM coverage to Dale Hallion as a person \u201coccupying\u201d the covered vehicle. Applying the clear policy language, we conclude that CNA provided primary coverage and Liberty Mutual provided excess UIM coverage to plaintiffs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-9\"><em>[Id. </em>at 371, 766 A.2d 1224.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b91-10\">In <em>Di Ciurcio, supra, </em>299 <em>N.J.Super. </em>426, 691 A.2d 396, decided prior to <em>Magnifico, </em>we interpreted policy language substantially similar to that appearing in both <em>Magnifico </em>and <em>Hallion. </em>Plaintiff was a passenger in an automobile insured by Liberty Mutual and owned by the father of the driver. <em>Id. </em>at 428, 691 A.2d 396. Following an automobile accident involving another vehicle, plaintiff sought UIM coverage from both Allstate, plaintiffs father\u2019s automobile insurer, and from Liberty Mutual. <em>Id. </em>at 428-29, 691 A.2d 396. Allstate successfully argued that pursuant to its policy\u2019s \u201cexcess-escape\u201d provision, its coverage was excess to Liberty Mutual\u2019s primary coverage as insurer of the host vehicle, and we so held. <em>Id. </em>at 428, 433, 691 A.2d 396.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>We find defendant\u2019s argument here that its UIM coverage must be considered pro rata with plaintiffs coverage to be disingenuous. Not only does that argument fly in the face of <em>Magnifico, </em>it is also directly contrary to the position taken by this same defendant in <em>Di Ciurcio </em>in interpreting policy language substantially similar to that in' this case. Particularly irksome is defendant\u2019s inference that <em>Di Ciurcio </em>may have been decided incorrectly because it \u201ccame at a time of significant confusion in the area of underinsured motorist coverage,\u201d as is its observation that <em>\u201cDi Ciurcio </em>has yet to be followed in a subsequent case.\u201d Not only is <em>Di Ciurcio </em>a correct statement of the law, it is entirely consistent with both <em>Magnifico </em>and our recent decision in <em>Hallion. </em>Also noteworthy, defendant does not suggest that any language in its or plaintiffs policy compels a different result.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">In sum, we conclude that the trial judge erred in holding that the policies were to considered pro rata. We conclude that plaintiffs policy is excess to defendant\u2019s, which is primary.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-7\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b89-7\"> The Allstate Policy declares a $250,000 UIM coverage limit for any one person injured in any one accident, and $500,000 limit for all persons injured in any one accident. The Allstate Policy's Part C describes its UIM coverage:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ADk\">Insuring Agreement</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-8\">We will pay damages which an insured is legally entitled to recover from the owner or operator of an uninsured motor vehicle or underinsured motor vehicle where such coverage is indicated as applicable in the Declarations because of:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-9\">1. Bodily injury sustained by an insured and caused by an accident ... \u201cInsured\" as used in this Part means: ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-10\">2. Any other person occupying your covered auto ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-11\">Other Insurance</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-12\">If there is other applicable similar insurance we will pay only our share of the loss. Our share is the proportion that our limit of liability bears to the total of all applicable limits.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b89-13\">However, any insurance we provide with respect to a vehicle you do not own, or a vehicle owned by you or a family member which is not insured for this coverage under this policy, shall be excess over any other collectible insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"A2-\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>The Camden policy's Part C provides $1,000,000 UIM coverage as amended by its \"Uninsured Motorists Coverage-New Jersey\u201d endorsement. The Part C insuring agreement (per the New Jersey endorsement) provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-10\">Insuring Agreement</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-11\">We will pay compensatory damages which an \"insured\u201d is legally entitled to recover from the owner or-operator of an \"uninsured motor vehicle\u201d or \"underinsured motor vehicle\u201d where such coverage is indicated as applicable in the Schedule or Declarations because of:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-12\">1. \"Bodily injury\u201d sustained by an \"insured\u201d and caused by an accident</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-13\">\"Insured\u201d as used in this endorsement means:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-14\">You or any \"family member\u201d ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-15\">Other Insurance</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-16\">If there is other applicable similar insurance under more than one policy or provision of coverage:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-17\">1.

We will pay only our share of the loss. Our share is the proportion that our limit bears to the total of all applicable limits.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b92-8\"> We also rejected the conclusion reached by the trial judge here that there were two excess policies in effect which required pro-ration. As we observed in <em>Di Ciurcio, </em>\u201c[t]he word \u201cyou\u201d in the Liberty policy does not refer to plaintiff.\u201d 299 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 433, 691 A.2d 396. It refers to the named insured as shown in the declarations and the spouse if a resident of the same household. <em>Ibid. </em>Kenneth Adler is neither of those parties.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
