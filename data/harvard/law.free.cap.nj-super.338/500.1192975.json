However, the parties have consented to his participation in the decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b533-8\">The opinion of the court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b533-9\">WECKER, J.A.D.</author>\n<p id=\"b533-10\">John Harrington died in an airplane accident at Linden Airport on October 25, 1998. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:8-8a bars recovery against a public entity if the claimant fails to \u201cfile his claim with the public entity within ninety days of accrual----\u201d The ninetieth day after October 25, 1998 was Saturday, January 23. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:8-10a permits presentation of a claim \u201cto a local public entity by delivering it or mailing it certified mail to the entity.\u201d A tort claims notice was filed on behalf of his estate by hand-delivering the notice to the Clerk of the City of Linden on Monday, January 25,1999, ninety-two days after the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-13\">Plaintiff filed a motion in the Law Division seeking a declaration that its notice, delivered on January 25, was timely filed or in the alternative for leave to file a late claim pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:8-9. The motion judge denied plaintiffs requested relief, finding both the original notice of claim and the motion for leave to file a late notice untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-14\">We conclude that plaintiffs notice of claim was timely filed with the city when it was hand-delivered on Monday, January 25.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We therefore reverse. Although plaintiff could have accomplished timely filing by mailing the notice certified mail on the ninetieth day, Saturday, January 23, a day when the city\u2019s offices were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>closed, plaintiff chose instead to avail itself of the option of delivering the notice. Plaintiff did so on Monday, January 25, which was the next business day available for in-person delivery to the municipal entity.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">We find ample support for the proposition that where the ninetieth day after accrual of a tort claim against a public entity falls on a Saturday, the required notice can be timely filed by hand-delivery on the following Monday. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>36:1-1.1 provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-6\">Each Saturday in each year shall, for all purposes whatsoever as regards the transaction of business in the public offices of this State, and the counties and municipalities in this State, be considered as [a] Sunday and as [afpublic holiday[ ].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b534-7\">In <em>Poetz v. Mix, </em>7 <em>N.J. </em>436, 81 A.2d 741 (1951), the Court held that \u201cwhere the last day of the period prescribed by the statute of limitations for commencing an action ... falls on ... a Sunday or a legal holiday when public offices are legally closed to the transactions of business [which now includes Saturday<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>], such an action commenced on the next day which is not a <em>dies non </em>[<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>] is not too late----Such construction will best protect the interests of litigants and must for that reason be presumed to carry into effect the legislative intent.\u201d 7 <em>N.J. </em>at 446-47, 81 A.2d 741. In <em>Poetz, </em>where the two-year Statute of Limitations for filing plaintiffs complaint would have expired on a Saturday when the courthouse was closed, a mailed complaint that was opened in the courthouse on Monday was deemed timely.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-10\">In <em>State v. Rhodes, </em>11 <em>N.J. </em>515, 95 A.2d 383 (1953), the Court relied upon <em>Poetz </em>in holding that when a two-year Statute of Limitations on a fraud indictment would have expired on a Sunday, the indictment that was returned on the following Monday was timely. And in <em>Potter v. Brady Transfer &amp; Storage Co., </em>21 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number><em>N.J.Super. </em>175, 178, 91 A.2d 111 (App.Div.1952), we held that where the deadline for filing a worker\u2019s compensation claim fell on a Sunday, a claim filed on the following Monday was timely.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">Our court rules, specifically <em>R. </em>1:3-1, provide that if the last day of a period fixed for an act or event to occur falls on a Saturday, \u201cthe period runs until the end of the next day which is neither a Saturday, Sunday nor legal holiday.\u201d <em>See generally </em>Pressler, <em>N.J. Court Rules, </em>comment to <em>R. </em>1:3-1 and authorities cited therein. In <em>Mercer County Park Comm\u2019n v. DiTullio Plumbing &amp; Heating Co., Inc. </em>139 <em>N.J.Super. </em>36, 39, 352 A.2d 264 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>70 <em>N.J. </em>276, 359 A.2d 488 (1976), the thirty-day limit for accepting public bids pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40AH1-24 was construed to extend to the next business day when the thirtieth day fell on a Saturday. In <em>State v. Jones, </em>181 <em>N.J.Super. </em>549, 438 A.2d 581 (Law Div.1981), the court so extended the deadline for filing a civil forfeiture action pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:64-3a. And in the context of election law, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>19:11-1 extends filing deadlines that fall on \u201cSunday or any legal holiday\u201d to the \u201cnext following business day.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b535-7\">We see no reason to apply a different rule to the filing of a notice of tort claim, at least where a plaintiff chooses the option of delivering the notice to the public entity pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:8-10a. We hold that the next-business-day rule applies to the delivery of a required notice of claim under the Tort Claims Act, and delivery of plaintiffs tort claims notice on Monday, January 25 was timely.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b535-8\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b533-16\"> In light of our holding that the January 25 delivery represents a timely filing, we need not address the estate's motion for leave to file a late notice.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b534-11\"> <em>N.J.S.A. </em>36:1-1.1 was amended by L.1955, c. 196, effective August 5, 1955, to treat each Saturday of the year the same as a Sunday or public holiday.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b534-12\"> \"Dies non,\u201d short for \"dies non juridicus,\u201d is \"a day exempt from court proceedings, such as a holiday or a Sunday.\u201d <em>Black's Law Dictionary </em>466 (7th ed.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b535-9\"> We need not and therefore do not address in this opinion the question whether, if the ninetieth day falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, filing by mail must be accomplished by placing the notice into a mail collection site no later than the ninetieth day, and whether the availability of actual mail collection and a postmark on Saturdays but not on Sundays or legal holidays would affect the answer to that question.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
