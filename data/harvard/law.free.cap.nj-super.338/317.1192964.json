He subsequently pled guilty to obstruction of justice, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:29-1, on a separate occasion in exchange for a recommended concurrent sentence. Defendant was sentenced to six years in the custody of the Department of Corrections, with 85% to be served before parole eligibility on the armed robbery,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and to concurrent sen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>tences.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On this appeal, defendant argues that the guilty plea to obstructing justice lacked a factual basis; the trial judge did not follow the sentencing guidelines in sentencing defendant; the finding of aggravating factors was not based on competent credible evidence; and \u201cdefendant was deprived of his constitutional right to counsel both at the plea and sentencing stages of his criminal proceeding[, and, therefore,] his sentence must be vacated and remanded to the trial court.\u201d With respect to the last point, defendant specifically contends that his trial counsel \u201cshould never have conceded that NERA applied.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">The prosecutor detailed the original plea agreement as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AqlG\">The defendant \u2014 it is the State\u2019s understanding the defendant will retract his previously entered plea of not guilty and plead guilty to counts one, two and three of the accusation. At the time of sentencing the State will recommend that the defendant be sentenced as a second degree offender and will further recommend the defendant be sentenced to seven years in New Jersey State Prison. No \u2014 the No Early Release Act does apply to count one of this accusation. Therefore, the defendant will be required to serve eighty-five percent of the sentence that he receives.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-6\">The other conditions of the plea are that the defendant give a truthful factual basis under oath and that he testify against the juvenile co-defendant, [T.H.], in juvenile court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-7\">At the time of sentencing the State will move to dismiss the remaining counts and complaints involved in these two incidents.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-8\">The defendant also agrees to make restitution in the amount of eight hundred dollars to the victim Andrew Thiele for property that was taken from him during the course of the robbery.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b352-9\">At the plea proceedings, defendant acknowledged that he signed the plea form which included the \u201cSupplemental Plea Form for No Early Release Act Cases.\u201d The plea colloquy also included the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-10\">THE COURT: Of course the plea agreement says seven years flat. I don\u2019t see anything with a stip as they call it. So there\u2019s a seven year period but there\u2019s no mandatory period of parole ineligibility. Do you understand that, sir?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-11\">MR. HERNANDEZ: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>THE COURT: Do you also understand the charges to which you are pleading guilty carry a mandatory period of parole ineligibility but not a mandatory extended term? That is, since it is under the eighty-five percent rule \u2014 I\u2019ll get to that in a moment \u2014 you will have to serve eighty-five percent of whatever you are sentenced to on this charge. Do you understand that, sir?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-6\">MR. HERNANDEZ: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-7\">THE COURT: Do you also understand the crime to which you are pleading guilty, at least the first and second count are first and second degree crimes so they contain a presumption of imprisonment which means it is almost certain that you are going to State Prison? Do you understand that sir? <footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-8\">MR. HERNANDEZ: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-9\">THE COURT: And do you understand because of your guilty plea, which is theft with injury, which makes it robbery, you will be required to serve eighty-five percent of the sentence imposed for that offense before you become eligible for parole?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-10\">MR. HERNANDEZ: Yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b353-11\">A lengthy discussion then followed between counsel and the court concerning completion of the NERA Supplementary Plea Form after which defendant initialed question 2(b) of the form which reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-12\">Do you understand that by pleading guilty to these charges, the minimum mandatory period of parole ineligibility is <em>5 </em>years and <em>11 </em>months (fill in the number of years/months) and the maximum period of parole ineligibility can be-years and \u2014 months (fill in number of years/months) and this period cannot be reduced by good time, work or minimum custody credits?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b353-15\">In his factual basis for the plea, defendant acknowledged that he and another male stole the victim\u2019s black leather coat and jewelry as part of a conspiracy directed by T.H. and that he \u201cstruck\u201d the victim \u201c[b]ehind his head on his neck\u201d with a baseball bat.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-16\">Before us, defendant asserts that his factual basis does not admit enough to justify a NERA sentence. He skillfully seeks to maintain the negotiated plea and downgrade for sentencing purposes, <em>see N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-lf(2), but to vacate the NERA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>ineligibility term. His effort is like running through a minefield. While we disagree with his contentions, and conclude that the admitted elements of armed robbery with a baseball bat (which defendant stated that he used to strike the victim on his neck) satisfies the definition of \u201cviolent crime\u201d under <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:43-7.2d, <em>cf. State v. Johnson, </em>166 <em>N.J. </em>523, 545-47, 766 A.2d 1126 (2001) (trial proofs sufficed for purposes of NERA),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> we add that defendant should not be able to both obtain the benefit of the negotiated downgrade premised on the application of NERA and yet repudiate the NERA sentence. <em>See State v. Cheung, </em>328 <em>N.J.Super. </em>368, 370, 746 A.2d 38 (App.Div.2000); <em>State v. Meyer, </em>327 <em>N.J.Super. </em>50, 55 n. 4, 742 A.2d 614 (App.Div.2000), <em>certif. denied, </em>164 <em>N.J. </em>191, 752 A.2d 1292 (2000). <em>See also State v. Reardon, </em>337 <em>N.J.Super. </em>324, 325-27, 766 A.2d 1203 (App.Div. 2001) (reduction to second degree robbery premised on application of NERA). Cases which do not involve defendant\u2019s acknowledgment of the application of NERA, or the factor warranting a NERA sentence, as part of a negotiated plea are distinguishable. <em>See, e.g., State v. Johnson, supra, </em>(jury to decide NERA issue); <em>State v. Thomas, </em>166 <em>N.J. </em>560, 573-74, 767 A.2d 459 (2001) (NERA issue contested at time of plea; independent proof must be presented in a manner consistent with <em>Johnson, </em>when NERA factor is not element of the offense). <em>Compare State v. Rumblin, </em>166 <em>N.J. </em>550, 766 A.2d 1141 (2001) (factual basis sufficient; NERA sentence upheld). The guilty plea suffices for NERA purposes when the elements of the offense provide the NERA factor or factors, <em>see State v. Thomas, supra, </em>166 <em>N.J. </em>at 573-74, 767 A.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>459; <em>see also State v. Rumblin, supra; State v. Meyer, supra, </em>or when the defendant\u2019s factual basis satisfies NERA. In this case the factual basis for defendant\u2019s plea acknowledged the NERA factors.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">Here defendant does not want to vacate the negotiated plea to first degree robbery to be sentenced as a second degree offender, and he cannot \u201cconcede the validity of his guilty plea\u201d but attack the basis for the application of NERA. <em>State v. Staten, </em>327 <em>N.J.Super. </em>349, 359, 743 A.2d 365 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>164 <em>N.J. </em>561, 753 A.2d 1153 (2000). We will not preclude a defendant who acknowledged the application of NERA at the time of plea from arguing that the factual basis for his plea is insufficient to permit a NERA sentence. A question of sentence legality is involved. <em>See State v. Meyer, supra, </em>327 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 55, 742 A.2d 614. However, in our view, where application of NERA has been acknowledged at the time of a negotiated plea, the defendant must first make an application in the trial court to vacate the plea. In this way, the record will be clear that he understands that a successful attack on the sentence means that all charges may be resurrected. <em>See State v. Cheung, supra, </em>328 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 370, 746 A.2d 38.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-7\">Defendant also claims that the six-year sentence was excessive and particularly so because the judge considered the obstruction of justice conviction as an aggravating factor. He further argues that the obstructing conviction must be vacated in the absence of an adequate factual basis, thus requiring a new sentence on the armed robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-8\">Defendant stated in entering his guilty plea that the police \u201cwouldn\u2019t let me go in my house\u201d while arresting his brother and directed him to leave the area. Defendant acknowledged that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>continued to curse at the police, did not leave the area, and did not follow the instructions from the police. While it would have been preferable if the plea judge expressly asked defendant, as the prosecutor suggested, whether defendant \u201cinterfered with the police while they [were] arresting his brother,\u201d we are satisfied\u2014 as was the judge \u2014 that there was an adequate factual basis. This is so particularly in light of the colloquy following the prosecutor\u2019s comment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-5\">THE COURT: Well, he did say they were arresting him and he \u2014 was trying to get \u2014 get to his brother, and they told him to . leave and he wouldn\u2019t leave.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-7\">THE DEFENDANT: Right.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b356-8\">Moreover, we find no basis for disturbing the six year sentence on the first degree armed robbery conviction. <em>See State v. Balfour, </em>135 <em>N.J. </em>30, 39-41, 637 A.2d 1249 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b356-9\">Finally, this record \u2014 with the negotiated disposition involved\u2014 does not support defendant\u2019s claim that he did not obtain the effective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-10\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b351-14\">. The judgment provides for a \"61.20 month stip.\u201d We urge trial judges to detail the length of a NERA ineligibility term in terms of years, months and days to avoid any problem long after the time of sentencing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b352-12\"> The judgment provides that NERA applies to the fourth degree obstruction of justice charge. We direct that it be vacated. <em>See NJ.S.A. </em>2C:43-7.2.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b353-17\"> The first quoted question was inappropriate in this case. We do not address whether the presumption of imprisonment, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-1d, can be overcome in extraordinary circumstances in a NERA case. <em>See NJ.S.A. </em>2C:43-7.2a; <em>see also, e.g., State v. Jabbour, </em>118 N.J. 1, 7-8, 570 A.2d 391 (1990).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b354-5\"> Count one of the accusation alleged that defendant inflicted \"bodily injury\" during a theft \"by use of a deadly weapon.\" <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>2C:15-la, b. While the definition of \"deadly weapon\" in <em>NJ.S.A. </em>2C:43-7.2d does not include the final phrase of <em>NJ.S.A. </em>2C:11-1c which applies to a chapter 15 robbery, defendant also pled guilty to count two of the accusation charging possession of the baseball bat \"with the purpose to use it unlawfully against the person or property of another, contrary to the provisions of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:39-4(d).\" He thus acknowledged that the baseball bat was, in fact, a real \"weapon,\" and not merely one that satisfies the last phrase of <em>NJ.S.A. </em>2C:11-1c. As noted above, defendant does not want to repudiate the guilty pleas to these offenses.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b355-9\"> This is not a case in which defendant merely acknowledged that the sentencing court might find NERA to be applicable. Nor is it a case in which defendant acknowledged the application of NERA without providing a factual basis for its application.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
