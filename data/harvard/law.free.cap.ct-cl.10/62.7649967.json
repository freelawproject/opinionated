The facts found by the court below were as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b73-7\">From the 4th day of March, 1865, to the 1st day of July, 1870, the claimant held the position and performed the duties of superintendent of the public gardens of the Department of Agri-cu ture, at a salary of $2,000 per annum.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b73-8\">For the time between July 1,1866, and June 30,1867, he was, under the joint resolution of February 28,1867, (14 Stat. L., 569,) paid, in separate monthly payments, 20 per cent, additional upon his said salary ; but he has not been paid anything additional upon said salary under the eighteenth section of the <em>Act July </em>28,1866, (14 Stat. L., 310, 323.) \u25a0</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b73-9\"><em>Mr. Attorney-General Williams </em>and <em>Mr. Assistant Attorney-General Goforth </em>for the United States, appellants :</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b73-10\">The claimant was not within the meaning of the eighteenth section of the <em>Act July </em>28,1866, (14 Stat. L., 310, 323.) From its language it is evident that it was intended for the benefit of those only who were directly or indirectly under the control of Congress; that is, of the legislative branch of the Government.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b73-11\">It enumerates, first, all the employ\u00e9s of the Senate and House of Eepresentatives-, then the reporters and stenographers of each House, and between the Capitol police and the employ\u00e9s of the Congressional Library are placed the three superintendents of the public gardens.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b73-12\">This juxtaposition (almost blending) of the officers of the public gardens with the officers of the Library is worthy of consideration in the construction of this section; for the Botanic Gardens and the Library are equally under the care and supervision of the Library Committee of Congress. Of the various gardens, Agricultural, Experimental, Propagating, President\u2019s, Congressional, and Botanic, none were included in the legislative appropriations but the latter.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b73-13\">No act of Congress ever created or recognized the office of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>superintendent of public gardens in any but the Botanic Garden. Whatever may have been Mr. Saunders\u2019 duties, yet he was not known in the eye of the law on the 28th June, 1866, as a superintendent of public garden. The same Congress afterward, by <em>Joint Resolution </em>approved <em>February </em>28, ;1867, (14 Stat. L., 569,) made an almost identical provision for the officers, employ\u00e9s, &amp;c., of the Executive Departments, the two together including all the employ\u00e9s of the Government within the city of Washington. Being <em>in pari </em>materia, they are to be construed as one act. The <em>resolution </em>allows 20 per cent, additional allowance on the salaries <em>inter alia </em>of civil officers, clerks, employ\u00e9s, &amp;c., of the Department of Agriculture and Commissioner of Public Buildings, thus providing for the public gardens not within the provisions of the eighteenth section of the <em>Act July </em>28, 1866. The Botanic Garden does not come within the resolution, and the appellee claims that among the many thousands benefited by the act and resolution, he and his comrades in the garden of the Department of Agriculture, for no special reason, were selected to be the recipients of a double portion. Claimant has received 20 per cent, under the joint resolution, placing himself, therefore, in the Executive Departments. Having made his election, he is estopped from changing his base of operations, and claiming as an employ\u00e9 in the legislative department.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b74-5\">In <em>Fdrich\u2019s Case, </em>(Coke\u2019s Reports, 118a, p. 240,) it was held that \u201cthe several inditing and penning of the former part, and of this branch, doth argue that the makers did intend a difference of the purviews and remedies, or otherwise they would have followed the same words:\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b74-6\">The present tense of the enacting clause of the eighteenth section indicates that it was intended for a grant or gratuity ending with the fiscal year, and not. for a continuing law. \u201cThat there <em>be allowed </em>and paid\u201d is very different from \u201c the compensation shall be\u201d of the seventeenth section, and is not the language which would be used in enacting a permanent rule for the conduct of disbursing officers of the Government. The further language of the section shows that its authors thought its whole purpose would be accomplished and its vitality gone when 20 per cent, on salaries from the beginning of the Thirty-ninth Congress to the date of its passage, or to the end of the fiscal year, had been allowed and paid, for <em>11 the </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number><em>amount necessary to gay this allowance'1'1 </em>is thereupon appropriated.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b75-6\">No argument' to the contrary can be drawn from the repeal of the act mentioned in claimant\u2019s petition, <em>(Act July </em>12,1870, 16 Stat. L., \u00a7 4, p. 250,) for this section is repealed only by implication, not expressly.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b75-7\"><em>Mr. J. W. Denver </em>for claimant, appellee:</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b75-8\">The question submitted to this court for decision is whether the act, which was made to take effect March 4,1865, extended beyond the date of its approval, July 28, 1866. Of this there would seem to be scarcely a reasonable doubt. It is a general act, and the only period of time referred to is that when it should take effect. The payment of the 20 per cent, additional to their present pay was \u201c to commence with the present Congress,\u201d and that Congress commenced on the 4th of March, 1865. There was no limitation as to the duration of the act, and it is a well-known fact that other officers and employ\u00e9s embraced under its provisions continued to be paid the 20 per cent, additional until it was finally repealed by the fourth section of the act approved July 12,1870, (16 Stat. L., 250.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b75-9\">The joint resolution approved February 28,1867, (14 Stat. L., 569,) gave an additional 20 per cent, to certain officers and employ\u00e9s therein mentioned, but that was limited to <em>one year. </em>The <em>Act March 3, </em>1865, (13 Stat. L., p. 497, \u00a7 2,) increased the commutation price of the officer\u2019s ration, but limited it to \u201c during the continuance of the present rebellion.\u201d Without this limitation would any one doubt that the increase in this case would not have been permanent and continuous in its operation ? And so with all statutes when not limited as to their duration. So with the eighteenth section of the <em>Act July </em>28,1S66. It continued in full force and effect until repealed by the <em>Act July </em>12,1870; and there is no conflict between the act and joint resolution. If Congress chose to make a permanent increase of compensation to Government officers and employes, and then to make an additional temporary increase for them, who will deny their right to do so 7</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b75-10\">Mr. Justice Bradley</author>\n<p id=\"A_a\">delivered the opinion of the court:</p>\n<p id=\"b75-11\">We are clearly of'the opinion that the claimant in this case was not within the intent and meaning of the <em>Act July </em>28, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>1866, (14 Stat. L., p. 310, \u00a7 18.) The Court of Claims finds, it is true, that he held the position of superintendent of the public garden of the Agricultural Department during the period for which the claim is made, namely, from March 4, 1865, to July 1,1870. But it is well known that the Botanical Garden near the Capitol has been regarded as a public garden for many years, and long before the Experimental Garden of the Agricultural Department was established, and that itwas managed by a superintendent and assistant superintendents. It is equally well known that this garden has for a long period, if not always, been under the immediate [direction and control of the Joint Library Committee of Congress. The public statutes contain a long series of appropriations for both garden and superintendents. Thus, in the appropriation bill of July 2,1864, for the year ending June 30, 1865, (13 Stat. L., 349,) the following appropriation was made:</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">\u201c <em>Botanic Garden. </em>\u2014 For grading, draining, procuring manure, tools, fuel and repairs, purchasing trees and shrubs, under the direction of the Library Committee of Congress, three thousand three hundred dollars.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">\u201cFor pay of superintendent of Botanic Garden, and assistants in the Botanic Garden and greenhouses, to be expended under the direction of the Library Committee of Congress, six thousand one hundred and forty-five dollars and eighty cents.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b76-7\">A similar provision is made in the appropriation bill for the year ending June 30,1866, adding $2,500, to be expended under direction of the Joint Committee of the Library, for erecting four greenhouses, (14 Stat. L., 21.) The like appropriation for salaries was made in the appropriation bill for the year ending June 30,1867, (14 Stat. L., 193.) Then comes the act in question, increasing the salaries 20 per cent., to commence with that Congress, to wit, March 4,1865. The act, as will be shown hereafter, increases the salaries of \u201c the three superintendents of the public gardens.\u201d Now, in the next appropriation bill, for the year ending June 30, 1868, not only is the ordinary appropriation made for the \u201cBotanic Garden, under direction of Library Committee of Congress, $3,300,\u201d and for pay of <em>superintendent and assistants, </em>and assistants in Botanic Garden and greenhouse, under the direction of the Library Committee of Congress, $6,145.80,\u201d but a continuation of the 20 per cent, is added thus : \u201c For 20 per centum additional on the pay of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>above, $1,229.16.\u201d The designation \u201c superintendent and assistants\u201d implies at least three in number. No such appropriation is found in reference to the Experimental G-arden attached to the Department of Agriculture. Whilst the Botanic Garden, under the .direction of the Joint Library Committee of Congress, with its superintendent and his assistants, <em>eo nomine, </em>have thus been the subject of appropriations for a long period, the Experimental Garden established by the Department of Agriculture was comparatively recent, and regarded as an appendage of that Department, and the appropriations therefor had been made under the general head of appropriations for the said Department, and no appropriation for any superintendent thereof, <em>eo nomine, </em>had ever been made up to the time of the passage of the <em>Aet July </em>28,1866. The appropriation had been for the \u201cExperimental Garden\u201d and for the salary of the foreman and laborers. (See 13 Stat. L., 155; 14 <em>id., </em>202.)</p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">From this legislative history it is apparent that the Botanic Garden near the Capitol was regarded as a public garden; that it had a superintendent and assistant superintendents; that appropriations' had for years been made for their salaries as superintendent and assistants byname; and that they were employed, and the garden'was managed, under the immediate direction of the Joint Library Committee of the two Houses of Congress. They were in fact employ\u00e9s of this committee.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-7\">Now, it seems to us that the eighteenth section of the <em>Act July </em>28, 1866, which provides for the addition of the 20 per cent, now claimed by the appellee, had reference only to persons employed under the direction of the two Houses of. Congress or their committees, and not to those of any of the Executive Departments. The section itself is its own best interpreter. It is as follows, (14 Stat. L., 323:)</p>\n<p id=\"b77-8\">\u201c Sec. 18. <em>And be it further enacted, </em>That there be allowed and paid to the officers, clerks, committee clerks, messengers, and all other employ\u00e9s of the Senate and House of Bepresenta-tives, and to the Globe and official reporters of each House, and the stenographer of the House, and to the Capitol police, and \u25a0 the three superintendents of the public gardens, their clerks and assistants, and to. the librarian, assistant librarians, messengers, and other employ\u00e9s of the Congressional Library, an addition of 20 per cent, on their present pay, to commence with the present Congress; and the amount necessary to pay <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>this allowance is hereby appropriated out of any money in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">In view of the long supervision over the Botanic Garden by the Library Committee, and of the previous legislation referred to, language could hardly be plainer.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">But there is additional evidence that this increase of salary was intended to be confined to persons employed under the immediate direction of the two Houses of Congress and their committees, in the fact that by a <em>Joint Resolution February </em>28, 1867, (14 Stat. L., 569,) 20 per cent, was added to the salaries of all employ\u00e9s of the several Executive Departments, including the Department of Agriculture, for one year from and after the 30th of June, 1866; and the claimant actually received such addition accordingly. It is not reasonable to suppose that Congress intended to single out this particular employ\u00e9 from all the Government employ\u00e9s as alone entitled to a double addition of 20 per cent, to his compensation, which he certainly would receive for the year named, if his construction of the <em>Act July </em>28, 1866, is the correct one.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-7\">The judgment must be reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
