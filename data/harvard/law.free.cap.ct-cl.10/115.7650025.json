It subsequently appears that the resolution of the Government to place the subsistence of these Indians wider the Commissary Department was made on the 20th May, under the </em>Appropriation Act April 10, 1869, (10 <em>Stat.

The court below decides that in May, </em>1869, <em>a commissary of subsistence had no right to contract for the subsistence of Indians under the act until the Government should determine to place them within the care_ of the Commissary Department and issue instructions to that effect; also that the contract in question contemplated only subsistence for troops and ordinary camp followers, and not for Indians.

Brig. Gen. M. E. Morgan, chief commissary of subsistence, Department of Missouri, by public advertisement, gave notice that <em>u </em>sealed proposals, in duplicate, would be received at his office, (Fort Leavenworth, Kansas,) or at the office of the assistant commissary of subsistence at Fort Lyon, Colorado Territory, and Fort Wallace, Kansas, until 12 o\u2019clock m., Tuesday, May 18, 1869, for supplying net beef from the block to the troops and others supplied at Camp Supply, mouth of Beaver Creek, or such other post as may be established in the northern part of the Indian Territory, on the Cheyenne and Arapahoe reservation, at which post there will be six companies. It is expected, when Camp Supply is discontinued, that the other post in the Indian Territory here referred to will have been established. The contracts will commence at all the posts July 1, 1869. They will expire December 31, 1869, at Harker, Hays, Wallace, and Lake Station, and June 30 at all the other posts. There is nothing positive as to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>number of troops at each post. The above is as close to it as we can get at this time.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b127-3\">In response to the foregoing advertisement, the claimant, on the 18th of May, 1869, proposed to \u201cfurnish and deliver to the United States, at the subsistence depot at Camp Supply, Beaver Creek, Fort Larned, and Camp Beecher, the following stores: Fresh beef from the block and on the hoof, net weight, for the sum of 7.4 cents per pound,\u201d &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b127-4\">Claimant\u2019s bid was accepted, and the contract, in words and figures as set forth in the petition, entered into on the 26th May, 1869, by and between him and M. E. Morgan, brevet brigadier-general and commissary of subsistence, chief commissary of subsistence Department of Missouri, acting on behalf of the United States Government.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b127-5\">About the time this contract was awarded to the claimant, other contracts for supplying troops were also awarded to him, none of which', however, are involved in this controversy.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b127-6\">This contract was not terminated by the Commissary-General of Subsistence, .but ran fora period of twelve months, from the 1st day of July, 1869, to the 30th day of June, 1870, during which time he furnished and delivered at the points specified, and of the quality specified, all the fresh beef upon the block required by the Subsistence Department, for which he has been paid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b127-7\">It also appears that he expressed himself ready, on a little notice, to furnish such cattle on the hoof as might be needed for supplying the Indians; and he is shown to have furnished a quantity of beef for that purpose soon after his contract, was executed, for which vouchers were issued, and he has been paid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b127-8\">The duty of supplying the Indian service with provisions had been in charge of the Interior Department, but on May 20,1869, the War Department, such duty devolving upon it, directed the Commissary-General of Subsistence to furnish the supplies for the Indian service, which would be paid out of the appropriation of $2,000,000 made specially for said service.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b127-9\">On May 22, 1869, General Eaton, Commissary-General of Subsistence, at Washington, informed General Clarke, acting commissary-general of subsistence Military Division of Missouri, headquarters in Chicago, in which division Camp Supply was situated, that the Subsistence Department would furnish the Indians on the reservation with supplies under the above order, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>'but said be could not give detailed instructions, but would furnish them at a later date. On May 26,1869, the date of the contract with Ryan, General Eaton forwarded to General Clarke the detailed instructions he had promised, and it was not until May 28, 1869, that General Clarke officially notified General Morgan, his subordinate, who was at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, that the Subsistence Department would furnish the supplies to the Indians on the reservations.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b128-6\">On June 5,1869, General Morgan, in performance of a special and extraordinary duty imposed upon him by General Clarke, advertised for proposals for furnishing beef-cattle for the Indian service at camp on Arapahoe and Cheyenne reservation, Indian Territory, and certain other places, and directed that proposals should be indorsed \u201cProposals for supplies for Indians.\u201d A proposal of D. W. Powers, for the delivery of 1,400 head of cattle for the Indian service having been accepted, a contract, dated July 13,1869, was entered into with Powers and General Morgan for the defendants.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b128-7\"><em>Messrs. Durwnt </em>&amp; <em>Kornor </em>for the claimant, appellant:</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b128-8\">It is contended that the same United States officer executing both of these contracts for the United States was authorized to act only in <em>one; </em>and hence the other contraet is void. The grounds for this are that the <em>Act of Congress March </em>2,1861, (12 Stat. L., 220,) did not confer any power upon the commissary to enter into the contract with claimant; and besides, he is expressly forbidden to exercise it by the Army Regulations. The lower court seems to have but little confidence, however, in the operation of the act of Congress, for it says that the act \u201c confers the authority on the commissary to purchase army supplies,\u201d and the officer in letting this contract appears to have strictly pursued its provisions. But the act does not confer any such power on the commissary (the power to contract for Indian supplies,) but he is expressly forbidden to exercise it by the Army Regulations. The court below in its opinion quotes paragraphs 1202 and 1203 oftheRegulations. Theact of Congress referred to is a general law, and applies as well to the Powers contract as to the plaintiff\u2019s; and as for the regulations quoted, it is submitted that they do not in any wise sustain the construction put upon them. The contract of Ryan involved <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>great expense and great risk in its fulfillment. He was bound by its provisions. If be failed, tbe Government would bold bim to the strict letter of bis contract. But when tbe wrong is on its side, it pleads -want of capacity to act and deficient \u25a0legal relations. If it be conceded that tbe Government is to be treated in the present case precisely as a private individual, tbe right of plaintiff to recover is clear, and the judgment appealed from should be rendered in bis favor for tbe amount \u2022sued for.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b129-6\"><em>Mr. Attorney-General Williams </em>and <em>Mr. Solicitor-General Phillips </em>for tbe United States, appellees:</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b129-7\">That there was no public exigency for tbe immediate delivery of tbe Indian supplies at the time when these contracts were made is shown by tbe fact that- General Morgan advertised for them. (12 Stat. L., 220.) Therefore tbe power of General Morgan to contract with Byan for beef on the 26th of May depended, among other things, upon whether be bad advertised, and the extent of bis power depended upon tbe terms of bis advertisement. <em>{Act of </em>1861, oh. 84, \u00a7 10,12 Stat. L., 220.) General words in the contract are to be restrained by tbe specific expressions of tbe \u201c enabling \u201d advertisement;</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b129-8\">Genera] Morgan could not, upon tbe 26 tb of May, 1869, have made a contract for Indian supplies based upon an advertisement for such supplies running from tbe 3d to tbe 18th of that month, because, previously to the 20th of that month, tbe War Department could not have authorized such an advertisement. As a subordinate officer, General Morgan, unless specially authorized, could make no such contract until after tbe 28th of May, 1869. <em>{Stevens </em>v. <em>United States, </em>2 O. (Jls. B., 95.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b129-9\">Taking tbe contract and tbe advertisement together, General Morgan did not attempt to make such a contract, as it is very plain that bis advertisement was only for supplies for troops, (say) some six companies, with such other persons as from experience it was known would attend incidentally upon such, a body of troops situated at such a place. In this connection we submit that the advertisement, the whole source of General Morgan\u2019s power, which calls attention to the number of the troops to be supplied, viz, six companies, (adding, \u201cthere is nothing positive as to the number of troops at each post; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>the above is as close to it as we can get at this time,\u201d) did not and was not understood by the parties to extend to other persons unmentioned, whose number should have constituted them the principal subject of the contract. The contemporaneous action of the parties is also to be considered, <em>i. </em>e., the advertisement of General Morgan a week after his contract with the claimant, and the apparent acquiescence of the latter in that practical construction.
