Thereafter the putative father, the children and their mother lived together as one family and were supported by him until his death while in the employ of a subscriber under the workmen\u2019s compensation act. Upon claims by the children for compensation under the act, it was <em>held, </em>that, although, being illegitimate, the children would not come within the description of \u201cchildren\u201d contained in St. 1911, c. 751, Part II, \u00a7 7 (c), as amended by Sts. 1914, c. 708, \u00a7 3 (c) ; 1919, c. 204, they might be found to be members of the employee\u2019s family wholly dependent upon his earnings for support at the time of his death, and therefore to be dependents under the definition in St. 1911, c. 751, Part V, \u00a7 2, and to be entitled to compensation under Part II, \u00a7 7 of the act.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b230-15\">Certification to the Superior Court under the workmen\u2019s compensation act of a decision of the Industrial Accident Board upon claims by Frances and Andrea, minor illegitimate children of Andrea Gritta. a deceased employee, for compensation under the act.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b230-16\">\u25a0 The board by its decision denied requests by the insurer for the following rulings:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b231-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number><em>\u201c2. </em>On all the evidence, Frances and Andrea Pappalardo, otherwise known as Frances and Andrea Gritta, are not entitled to compensation.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b231-3\">\u201c3.

The board also affirmed the finding that the children did not come within the definition of \"child or children\u201d as those words are used in St. 1911, c. 751, Part II, \u00a7 7 (c), as amended by St. 1914, c. 708, \u00a7 3 (c), and St. 1919, c. 204. They must be held to refer only to a legitimate child or children. R. L. c. 133, \u00a7 3. <em>Baylis </em>v. <em>Baylis, </em>207 N. Y. 446.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-3\">After defining the persons who are conclusively presumed to be wholly dependent for support upon a deceased employee, in Part II, \u00a7 7, it is further provided in the same section that \u201cIn all other cases questions of dependency, in whole or in part, shall be determined in accordance with the fact, as the fact may be at the time of the injury.\u201d Part V, \u00a7 2 defines dependents as follows: \u201c'Dependents\u2019 shall mean members of the employee\u2019s family or next of kin who were wholly or partly dependent upon the earnings of the employee for support at the time of the injury.\u201d In <em>Cowden\u2019s Case, 225 </em>Mass. 66, it was said at page 67: \u201c\u2018Family\u2019 in its usual sense means 'the collective body of persons who live in one house and under one head or management.\u2019 <em>Dodge </em>v. <em>Boston &amp; Providence Railroad, </em>154 Mass. 299, 301. That is the significance ordinarily attributed to the word under the act. <em>Kelley\u2019s Case, 222 </em>Mass. 538. See <em>Newman\u2019s Case, 222 </em>Mass. 563, 568.\u201d See cases cited 19 Cyc. 451, 452, 453. The board has found that the children were members of the employee\u2019s family; that finding is amply supported by the evidence. It would seem plain from the facts recited in the record, that these children from the date of their respective births lived with their mother and the employee until his death; that he supported them and they were a part of his family to the same extent as if their parents had been lawfully married. The deceased employee recognized the moral obligation which rested upon him to support the children and cared for them as his own lawful offspring, and manifestly they were in fact members of his family at the time of his death.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\">The question remains whether the illegitimacy of these children affects their status as members of the employee\u2019s family under the act. It is the contention, of the insurer that, as the act <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>does not specifically include illegitimate children as entitled to its benefits, they should not be held to take by implication; and that in the interests of marital morality and sound public policy they should not be held to be members of the employee\u2019s family.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-3\">Considerations \u00f3f public policy which would prevent a wrongdoer from participating in the benefits of the act ought not to apply to innocent children born out of lawful matrimony; they are not responsible for their existence or status, they have committed no wrong, and they must be supported as the death of the employee has taken from them the care and maintenance which they had previously received from him as the head of the family. We are of opinion that upon the facts disclosed by the record they are entitled to compensation under the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-4\">Although the question has not previously been considered by this court, the conclusion reached is in harmony with that of courts in other jurisdictions where it has arisen under workmen\u2019s compensation acts containing provisions similar to our own in this respect. <em>Roberts </em>v. <em>Whaley, </em>192 Mich. 133. <em>Scott\u2019s Case, </em>117 Maine, 436. <em>Piccinim </em>v. <em>Connecticut Light &amp; Power Co. </em>93 Conn. 423.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">The cases of <em>Bell </em>v. <em>Terry &amp; Tench Co. </em>177 App. Div. (N. Y.) 123; <em>S. C. </em>163 N. Y. Supp. 733, <em>Scott </em>v. <em>Independent Ice Co. </em>135 Md. 343, are not at variance with the conclusion here reached. The language of the workmen\u2019s compensation acts there construed is materially different from ours, and for that reason need not be considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-9\">It follows that the rulings two and three requested by the insurer, could not properly have been made.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-10\">\n<em>Decree affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
