In case of Mrs. Sprague\u2019s decease, the principal to be kept as a fund for the Baptist Society at Westminster, Mass., interest to go to Theodosia Miles Whitman; and in case of her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>decease, interest to go to said Baptist Society.\u201d \u201cOn demand after date I promise to pay to the order of Ann Maria Sprague Four hundred Dollars with interest at 8% per annum. In case of Mrs. Sprague\u2019s decease, the principal to be kept as a fund for the Baptist Society at Westminster, Mass., interest to go to Theodosia Miles Whitman; and in case of her decease, interest to go to said Baptist Society.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">The defendants\u2019 demurrer having been sustained and judgment ordered in their favor, the question for decision on the plaintiff\u2019s appeal is, whether the instruments are negotiable promissory notes. If they are, it is immaterial that no value is expressly stated. R. L. c. 73, \u00a7 23. The promise in each instrument to pay to the order of the payee is absolute and she could by indorsement in her lifetime have transferred title, and the indorsee could have demanded and enforced payment. The words following do not create any contingency postponing payment, or impose any limitation on or modification of the defendants\u2019 promise to pay to her absolutely and at all events. It is plain that this is the only express contract between the intestate and the makers, and being unconditional the defence of non-negotiability cannot prevail. R. L. c. 73, \u00a7 18. <em>Cherry </em>v. <em>Sprague, </em>187 Mass. 113. <em>National Bank of Newbury </em>v. <em>Wentworth, </em>218 Mass. 30, 32. The judgment accordingly must be reversed and the demurrer overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
