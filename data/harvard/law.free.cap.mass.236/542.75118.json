This must stand if there was any evidence to support it. <em>Pass\u2019s Case, </em>232 Mass. 515, and cases there collected. Manifestly there was personal injury arising out of and in the course of the employment. The only question is whether there was ground for the finding that the death resulted from that injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-10\">There was testimony tending to show that at the time of the injury the employee had pulmonary tuberculosis and that the injury while not causing this disease hastened its progress or excited it to a fatal termination. This was enough to warrant a finding against the insurer. The case is fully within the scope of <em>Madden\u2019s Case, </em>222 Mass. 487, 493, and <em>Crowley\u2019s Case, </em>223 Mass. 288.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-11\">\n<em>Decree affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
