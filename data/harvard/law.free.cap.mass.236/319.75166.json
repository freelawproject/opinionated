Writ dated May 15,1918.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b345-10\">In the Superior Court, the action was heard by <em>Hammond, </em>J., upon the pleadings and an agreed statement of facts.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b345-11\">It appeared that the $226.88 sought by the plaintiff was the interest which had accrued at three per cent upon $6,875.45, which, because of certain claims filed against the defendant under the provisions of St. 1909, c. 514, \u00a7 23, was being held by the defendant as security after it was due and payable to the plaintiff on account of the contract price for the building of a school house by the plaintiff for the defendant. The plaintiff in his brief before this court stated, \u201cthat this is not an action brought for \u2018interest\u2019 at six per cent on account of the detention of this $6,875.45, or as a penalty against the defendant for withholding it after it was due and payable to the plaintiff. It was for the increment at three per cent upon that amount while it remained as a part of the general funds of the city, upon which the city was allowed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>three per cent on its deposit in a bank, until the said claims were extinguished by the plaintiff.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b346-5\">At the close of the evidence, the plaintiff asked for the following rulings:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b346-6\">\u201c1. Upon the pleadings and the agreed statement of facts the plaintiff is entitled to recover.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b346-7\"><em>\u201c2. </em>Upon all the evidence and the agreed statement of facts the plaintiff is entitled to recover.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b346-8\">The rulings were refused. The judge found for the defendant; and the plaintiff alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b346-9\">The case was submitted on briefs.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b346-10\"><em>M. M. Taylor, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b346-11\"><em>J. W. Mawbey &amp; F. L. Riley, </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b346-12\">Braley, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AsNq\">The general rule at law is that interest is allowed upon the ground of contract either expressed or implied for its payment, or by way of damages where money is detained, or for breach in the performance of a contract where some duty has been violated. <em>Dodge </em>v. <em>Perkins, </em>9 Pick. 368. <em>Donahue </em>v. <em>Partridge, </em>160 Mass. 336. <em>Whitcomb </em>v. <em>Whitcomb, </em>217 Mass. 558. While equity generally follows the law, interest occasionally is allowed in the exercise of a sound discretion. <em>Williams </em>v. <em>American Bank, </em>4 Met. 317. <em>Law </em>v. <em>East India Co. </em>4 Ves. Jr. 824. See <em>Hollister </em>v. <em>Barclay, </em>11 N. H. 501. The plaintiff accordingly must show either that his contract with the city provided for interest, or the amount retained to pay the claims of lienors had been wrongfully withheld. <em>Burr </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>212 Mass. 534.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-13\">By the terms of the contract if at any time there shall be evidence of any lien or other claim for which if established the defendant \u201cor the said premises might be liable, directly or indirectly, and which is chargeable to the contractor,\u201d the right is given to the city to retain out of any payment then due or thereafter to become due a sum sufficient \u201cto completely indemnify it against any such claim.\u201d The defendant lawfully could hold the money represented by the checks, which, though drawn in the plaintiff\u2019s favor, had not been delivered because of the pending bill in equity, brought under St. 1909, c. 514, \u00a7 23, to enforce payment of claims for materials furnished to, and of workmen employed on the building by a subcontractor who engaged to provide and to install the heating and ventilating plant. <em>Tower </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number><em>Miller, </em>211 Mass. 113,114. The claims having been adjusted and the bill dismissed, no legal advantage had accrued to either of the present parties over the other because of the litigation. <em>Webb Granite &amp; Construction Co. </em>v. <em>Worcester, </em>187 Mass. 385, 390, 391. And, the defendant having on the day after entry of the decree delivered to the plaintiff the checks for the unpaid balance which were accepted, it is manifest that no interest is due for the temporary detention of the money.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">It is conceded in the record that during the period of litigation the defendant was credited with interest on the balance in its general account, which having included the money ultimately paid to the plaintiff, he contends that even if interest as such cannot be recovered he is entitled to his proportionate part of the increment. But the defendant was not required to keep the money coming to the plaintiff under the contract separately and the title to the deposit remained in the city which sustained no fiduciary relation whatever to the plaintiff. <em>Vail </em>v. <em>Durant, </em>7 Allen, 408,410. <em>Central National Bank </em>v. <em>Connecticut Mutual Life Ins. Co. </em>104 U. S. 54. It did not unconscionably or unlawfully appropriate or retain any money of the plaintiff. See <em>Morse </em>v. <em>Lowell, </em>7 Met. 152; <em>Cronan </em>v. <em>Cotting, </em>104 Mass. 245; <em>Woodward </em>v. <em>Towne, </em>127 Mass. 41; <em>Raphael </em>v. <em>Mullen, </em>171 Mass. 111; <em>Furber </em>v. <em>Dane, </em>204 Mass. 412.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">The rights of the plaintiff as between him and the city were those of a general creditor and for the reasons stated the exceptions must be overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
