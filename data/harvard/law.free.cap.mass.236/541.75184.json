One Wolf-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>son, agent of the plaintiff, testified that in telephone conversation with one Woodside, representing the defendant, $4 per hour was stipulated between them, while Woodside testified that the price was $3.50 per hour. A witness, having testified that he was present when Wolfson said he was telephoning with Woodside, then was permitted to testify that at that time he heard Wolfson say into the telephone \u201cfour dollars an hour is all right.\u201d In this, there was no error of law. It was not hearsay evidence. It tended to confirm the testimony of Wolfson in part. Its weight depended upon the finding whether Wolfson\u2019s testimony to the effect that Woodside was at the other end of the telephone during that conversation was true; but that was wholly a question of fact.
