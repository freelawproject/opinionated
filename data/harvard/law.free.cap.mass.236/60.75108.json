Writ dated May 6, 1918.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b86-24\">In the Superior Court the action was heard by <em>Sisk, </em>J., without a jury. Before any evidence was introduced, the defendant in writing moved that the plaintiff be required to elect between the counts. The motion was denied. Upon all the evidence, the judge found that the plaintiff was not a salesman for the defendant. Other material facts found by him and exceptions saved by the defendant are described in the opinion. There was a find-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>for the plaintiff in the sum of $752.77; and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b87-3\"><em>F.

He found for the plaintiff in the sum of $752.77. No question as to amount is involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">The findings must stand if supported by any foundation in evidence. <em>Bangs </em>v. <em>Farr, </em>209 Mass. 339. <em>Evans </em>v. <em>County of Middlesex, </em>209 Mass. 474. The letters although loosely phrased, and admitting of different deductions, warranted, but did not require, the findings of facts on which liability was based. They are well summarized in the carefully drawn decision of the judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-7\">Of the defendant\u2019s exceptions, those to requests numbered two and three are expressly waived. The remaining requests now in controversy were either inapplicable because of the judge\u2019s findings, or inconsistent therewith, and were properly refused.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-8\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
