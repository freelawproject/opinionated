At the trial, the defendant was asked by his counsel, \u201cWhat did the tearing off of those planks as they were tom off, in view of the condition of your boat, indicate about the skill or lack of skill of the operation?\u201d The question was excluded. <em>Held, </em>that the question was improper and rightly was excluded.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b467-12\">An exception by the defendant at a trial to a statement by the plaintiff\u2019s counsel to the jury, \u201cit is my honest opinion that this is a trumped up defence,\u201d will be overruled, although the statement was improper, where it appears that, at the conclusion of the charge, the matter being called to the judge\u2019s attention, he instructed the jury as follows: \u201cI ought to have corrected that in this respect: counsel frequently do, but ought not to, say what their opinion is about anything; their opinion is of no consequence to the jury. . . .

At the time of the sinking in the Cunard docks in East Boston, the lighter was loaded with about two hundred and eighty tons of sand, her capacity being three hundred tons. The principal issue tried was whether the work was performed in a proper and workmanlike manner, it being the contention of the defendant that the method of putting wire cables, called straps, under the lighter for the purpose of raising her was done in an improper manner and resulted in some of the planking being torn off the bottom of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>lighter causing the damages which the defendant seeks to recoup from the plaintiff\u2019s claim. Upon this issue the evidence was conflicting and presented a question of fact for the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">The defendant contends that the presiding judge erred, (1) in excluding a question put the defendant, (2) because counsel for the plaintiff was allowed to make an improper argument to the jury, and (3) in refusing to give certain requests for rulings.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">In direct examination the defendant was asked by his counsel, \u201cWhat did the tearing off of those planks as they were torn off, in view of the condition of your boat, indicate_ about the skill or lack of skill of the operation?\u201d This was excluded and the defendant excepted. The question, which was based on the facts as the witness found them and not on an hypothesis, called for an answer to the precise question which was the issue before the jury. Whether the planks came off because of the weight of sand in the boat or for some other reason, and before the plaintiff attempted to raise her, or were torn off by the plaintiff, was in dispute. The question allowed the witness to assume that the planks were torn off and then to give his opinion based upon the condition of the boat as he found it; it was rightly excluded. <em>Stoddard </em>v. <em>Winchester, </em>157 Mass. 567, 575. <em>Chalmers </em>v. <em>Whitmore Manuf. Co. </em>164 Mass. 532.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-7\">The plaintiff\u2019s counsel in his closing argument to the jury said: \u201cit is my honest opinion that this is a trumped up defence;\u201d at that time the defendant\u2019s counsel objected to the statement, the court ruled that it was not objectionable and the defendant excepted. The argument was clearly improper and the jury should then have been told to disregard it. The record shows that, at the conclusion of the charge, the judge\u2019s attention was again called to that part of the argument of counsel, and he then said to the jury, \u201cI ought to have corrected that in this respect; counsel frequently do, but ought not to, say what their opinion is about anything; their opinion is of no consequence to the jury. . . . But if he said and argued that you should believe upon the evidence that this was a trumped up charge, I see nothing which is open to criticism as an argument ... it is for the jury to say whether a statement in argument is warranted by the evidence or not. Counsel\u2019s opinion is of no consequence.\u201d We think these inst'ruc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>tians given at the conclusion of the charge corrected the erroneous ruling previously made; although the jury were not expressly told to disregard the objectionable argument, such was the plain effect of the instructions. We are of opinion the jury must have understood that the statement made by counsel should be disregarded. <em>Morrison </em>v. <em>Richardson, </em>194 Mass. 370, 377, 378. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Richmond, </em>207 Mass. 240, 250. <em>Mikkelson </em>v. <em>Connolly, </em>229 Mass. 360.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">It remains to consider the defendant\u2019s requests for rulings.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">Request \u201cC\u201d was covered by the instructions given.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-7\">The exceptions to the refusals to give requests \u201cF\u201d and \u201cG\u201d must be overruled. While the judge stated that the method of doing the work might have been due to an error of judgment \u201cwhich does not imply any lack of reasonable skill or reasonable care,\u201d it plainly appears that the case was tried wholly on the issue whether the work was properly or negligently performed; there was no evidence of error of judgment as distinguished from negligence, and no contention was made by the plaintiff that he committed any error of judgment, his sole contention in this connection being that the work was performed without negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-8\">Request \u201cH\u201d could not have been given. The jury were instructed in substance that it would be for them to determine what the plaintiff\u2019s services were reasonably worth; and also, that the defendant was entitled to have deducted from the claim of the plaintiff the amount of any damage done to the lighter arising from negligence of the plaintiff, and that, if they should find that the defendant by reason of such negligence had suffered damage equal to or in excess of the amount of the plaintiff\u2019s \u201cproper bill,\u201d then they would return a verdict for the defendant. We think that the instructions given covered this request. It might be assumed in the absence of evidence to the contrary that the charges were to be governed by charges for similar services at the time and place in question. The instruction that the burden of proof was on the defendant in a case of recoupment was correct. <em>Sayles </em>v. <em>Quinn, </em>196 Mass. 492.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-9\">Request \u201cJ\u201d could not have been given. The only evidence of the plaintiff\u2019s negligence was that relating to the method adopted in putting the straps under the lighter, and allowing her to strike the bottom of the harbor while being towed to the flats; accord<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>ingly it could not have been inferred that there was any other negligence on his part.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">Request \u201cK\u201d was rightly refused. This is not a case where the doctrine of <em>res ipso loquitur </em>can be held to apply. \u2022 The jury would not have been warranted in inferring in the absence of any explanation, that according to common experience planks would not be detached from the bottom of the boat except for the plaintiff's fault. <em>Curtin </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>194 Mass. 260, 264. <em>Kusick </em>v. <em>Thorndike &amp; Hicks, Inc. </em>224 Mass. 413.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">We have examined the remaining exceptions and are of opinion that no reversible error is shown. So far as they were founded 1 on correct principles of law and were applicable, they were covered by the charge, which is reported in full.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-7\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
