Act 85-1451, eff. March 15, 1989) (the Act). The Act establishes pay raises for State\u2019s Attorneys in Illinois by amending \u201cAn Act concerning fees and salaries ***\u201d (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1987, ch. 53, par. 1 et seq.). Although the State\u2019s Attorneys\u2019 terms of office do not expire until 1992, the pay raises became effective immediately upon the bill\u2019s enactment. Soon thereafter, petitioner Elaine J. Mitchell, treasurer of Kendall County (the treasurer), paid petitioner Dallas C. Ingemunson, State\u2019s Attorney of Kendall County (the State\u2019s Attorney), the increased salary provided for in the Act. The treasurer then submitted to respondent, Jay Hedges, Director of Commerce and Community Affairs (the Director), whose duty under the Act is to reimburse county treasurers the costs of the salary increases set forth in the Act, a voucher reflecting the increased salary which had been paid by the treasurer to the State\u2019s Attorney. The Director refused to pay the voucher and stated that he would not pay any future claims for payment of salaries under the Act. The Director believed that the Illinois Constitution prohibits any increase in salary for State\u2019s Attorneys during the course of their four-year terms of office. Petitioners subsequently sought, and were granted, leave to file with this court a petition for writ of mandamus or other relief (Ill. Const. 1970, art. VI, \u00a74(a); 107 Ill. 2d R. 381). Petitioners seek mandamus to compel the Director to reimburse the treasurer for the increased payments made by the treasurer to the State\u2019s Attorney pursuant to the Act.</p> <p id=\"b376-5\" pgmap=\"376\">In deciding whether the Illinois Constitution prohibits State\u2019s Attorneys from receiving pay increases during their terms of office, we must, of course, look to the language of the constitution itself. Section 21 of the executive article of the Illinois Constitution provides:</p> <blockquote id=\"b376-6\" pgmap=\"376\">\u201cOfficers of the Executive Branch shall be paid salaries established by law and shall receive no other compensation for their services. Changes in the salaries of these officers elected or appointed for stated terms shall not take effect during the stated terms.\u201d (Ill. Const. 1970, art. V, \u00a721.)</blockquote> <p id=\"b376-7\" pgmap=\"376\">Thus, if State\u2019s Attorneys are \u201c[ojfficers of the Executive Branch\u201d under the Illinois Constitution, then they cannot receive an increase in their salaries until after they have completed their current terms of office.</p> <p id=\"b376-8\" pgmap=\"376(57) 377(65)\">Section 1 of article V states that \u201c[t]he Executive Branch shall include a Governor, Lieutenant Governor, Attorney General, Secretary of State, Comptroller and Treasurer.\u201d (Ill. Const. 1970, art. V, \u00a71.) These six specifically enumerated officers are clearly subject to the salary-increase prohibition contained in section 21. Furthermore, section 9(a) of that article provides that the Governor \u201cshall appoint all officers whose election or appointment is not otherwise provided for\u201d (Ill. Const. 1970, art. V, \u00a79(a)), and this court, in construing a similar provision from the 1870 Constitution (Ill. Const. 1870, art. V, \u00a710), held that such appointed officers are also members of the executive branch for pay-raise purposes (see Peabody v. Russel (1922), 301 Ill. 439, 444-45).</p> <p id=\"b377-3\" pgmap=\"377(272) 378(61)\">The office of State\u2019s Attorney, however, is neither specifically named in the executive article nor one which is filled by executive appointment. Instead, the office of State\u2019s Attorney is established by section 19 of article VI, the judicial article. (Ill. Const. 1970, art. VI, \u00a719.) The judicial article, unlike the executive article (and the legislative and local government articles (see Ill. Const. 1970, art. IV, \u00a711; art. VII, \u00a79(b))), does not contain a general section prohibiting salary increases. Rather, the judicial article sets forth a different, specific salary provision for each of the types of officers that are enumerated in the article. (See Ill. Const. 1970, art. VI, \u00a714 (\u201cJudges shall receive salaries provided by law which shall not be diminished to take effect during their terms of office\u201d), \u00a718 (\u201cThe salaries of clerks and other non-judicial officers [appointed by judges] shall be as provided by law\u201d), \u00a719 (\u201cA State\u2019s Attorney[\u2019s] *** salary shall be provided by law).) We find that the drafters of our constitution, by placing the office of State\u2019s Attorney in the judicial article, and specifying that \u201c[a] State\u2019s Attorney's] *** salary shall be provided by law,\u201d could not have intended that State\u2019s Attorneys be subject to the executive article\u2019s salary-raise prohibition (Ill. Const. 1970, art. V, \u00a721). Had the drafters so intended, we believe that they would have done so in the type of clear and unambiguous language that the drafters used in prohibiting legislative, executive, and local governmental officials from receiving salary raises during their terms of office. See Ill. Const. 1970, art. IV, \u00a711; art. V, \u00a721; art. VII, \u00a79(b); see also Ill. Const. 1970, art. VI, \u00a714 (\u201cJudges shall receive salaries provided by law which shall not be diminished to take effect during their terms of office\u201d (emphasis added)); cf. Ill. Const. 1870, article VI, \u00a725 (pre-1962 revision) (the compensation for Cook County judges and Cook County State\u2019s Attorneys \u201cshall not be changed during their continuance in office\u201d).</p> <p id=\"b378-3\" pgmap=\"378\">The Director, however, argues that despite the placement of the office of State\u2019s Attorney in the judicial article, State\u2019s Attorneys should be subject to the salary-increase prohibition contained in the executive article. The Director relies upon this court\u2019s decision in People v. Williams (1908), 232 Ill. 519, a number of decisions of the Illinois appellate court and numerous policy arguments to support his claim.</p> <p id=\"b378-4\" pgmap=\"378(186) 379(19)\">The issue in Williams was virtually identical to the issue before us here: i.e., whether a State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s compensation may be increased during his term of office. (Williams, 232 Ill. at 520.) The Illinois Constitution of 1870, like the Illinois Constitution of 1970, placed the office of State\u2019s Attorney in the judicial article (Ill. Const. 1870, art. VI, \u00a721). Nevertheless, despite the placement of the office of State\u2019s Attorney in the judicial article, this court held in Williams that, for purposes of compensation, State\u2019s Attorneys were county officers and so were subject to the constitutional provisions which prohibited county officers from receiving an increased salary during their terms of office (see Ill. Const. 1870, art. IX, \u00a711; art. X, \u00a710). (Williams, 232 Ill. at 520-21.) The conclusion that State\u2019s Attorneys were county officers was based upon this court\u2019s recognition that a State\u2019s Attorney \u201c \u2018is elected for and within a county to perform his duties therein, and is not distinguished in any manner from the clerks of the courts, the sheriff, coroner and other officers connected with the administration of justice within the county.\u2019 \u201d Williams, 232 Ill. at 521, quoting County of Cook v. Healy (1906), 222 Ill. 310, 316.</p> <p id=\"b379-3\" pgmap=\"379\">The Director claims that this court, as it did in Williams, should disregard the fact that the office of State\u2019s Attorney is in the judicial article and look instead to the State\u2019s Attorneys\u2019 functions to determine whether State\u2019s Attorneys should be subject to the executive article\u2019s salary-increase prohibition. The Director cites a number of Illinois appellate court decisions (see People v. Thompson (1980), 88 Ill. App. 3d 375; People v. Sievers (1978), 56 Ill. App. 3d 880; People v. Vaughn (1977), 49 Ill. App. 3d 37; People v. Baron (1970), 130 Ill. App. 2d 588) which have utilized such a functional approach to find that State\u2019s Attorneys are members of the executive branch. We note that this court has similarly used a functional approach in finding that State\u2019s Attorneys are members of the executive branch. See People ex rel. Daley v. Suria (1986), 112 Ill. 2d 26, 36-38; People ex rel. Daley v. Moran (1983), 94 Ill. 2d 41, 45-46.</p> <p id=\"b379-4\" pgmap=\"379(155) 380(27)\">The problem with the Director\u2019s argument is that it requires us to reject the clear language and structure of the constitution in favor of a structure of government which the Director believes is more \u201cproper and realistic.\u201d Such a rewriting or ignoring of the language of the constitution by this court would, of course, be improper. Furthermore, the reasoning used in Williams provides little support for the Director\u2019s argument in light of this court\u2019s decision in Hoyne v. Danisch (1914), 264 Ill. 467. Hoyne established that State\u2019s Attorneys are State officers under the language of the constitution, not, as the court had concluded in Williams, county officers. (Hoyne, 264 Ill. at 470-72.) The debates of the Sixth Illinois Constitutional Convention of 1969-70 indicate that the drafters of our present constitution agreed with the decision in Hoyne that State\u2019s Attorneys should be classified as State, rather than county, officials. (See 2 Record of Proceedings, Sixth Illinois Constitutional Convention 730-31, 741-42.) Hoyne, however, did not address whether State\u2019s Attorneys are executive or judicial officers under the constitution.</p> <p id=\"b380-3\" pgmap=\"380\">Finally, this court\u2019s opinions in Suria and Moran, and the appellate court decisions cited by the Director, do not persuade us to accept the Director\u2019s argument. Those cases stand for the proposition that the decision concerning what charges should be filed against a criminal defendant is an executive one which should be exercised by the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s office, and not by judges. (See Suria, 112 Ill. 2d at 37-38; Moran, 94 Ill. 2d at 45-46; Thompson, 88 Ill. App. 3d at 377; Sievers, 56 Ill. App. 3d at 885; Vaughn, 49 Ill. App. 3d at 39; Baron, 130 Ill. App. 2d at 591.) Nothing in the constitution explicitly addresses the question of who may or may not institute criminal proceedings or whether such a decision is an executive or judicial function. Accordingly, it is necessary to look to history and tradition to decide whose role it is to institute criminal proceedings. (See People ex rel. Carey v. Cousins (1979), 77 Ill. 2d 531, 538-39 (cited in Moran, 94 Ill. 2d at 45, to support the proposition that \u201c[i]t is a familiar and firmly established principle that the State\u2019s Attorney, as a member of the executive branch of government, is vested with exclusive discretion in the initiation and management of a criminal prosecution\u201d).) Here, however, we need not look beyond the language of the constitution because, as we have explained, there are a number of specific provisions in the constitution regarding the issue of governmental salaries. Our analysis of these provisions leads us to conclude that, for purposes of compensation, State\u2019s Attorneys are not subject to the provisions of the executive article.</p> <p id=\"b380-4\" pgmap=\"380(17) 381(19)\">Accordingly, the writ of mandamus, ordering the Director to reimburse the treasurer for expenditures paid to the Kendall County State\u2019s Attorney for the increased salary provided for in Public Act 85 \u2014 1451, is awarded.</p> <p id=\"b381-3\" pgmap=\"381\">Writ awarded.</p> <p id=\"b381-4\" pgmap=\"381\">CHIEF JUSTICE MORAN took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.</p> </opinion> <opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\"> <author id=\"b381-5\" pgmap=\"381\">JUSTICE MILLER,</author> <p id=\"Aqd\" pgmap=\"381\">specially concurring:</p> <p id=\"b381-6\" pgmap=\"381\">I agree with the majority that the Illinois Constitution does not prohibit the General Assembly from increasing the salaries of the State\u2019s Attorneys during their terms of office. Because my construction of the Director\u2019s argument is somewhat different from the majority\u2019s understanding, however, I write separately to make clear the basis for my agreement with the court\u2019s decision.</p> <p id=\"b381-7\" pgmap=\"381(199) 382(23)\">The Director\u2019s argument is broader than the majority\u2019s paraphrases suggest. Contrary to the majority\u2019s view, the salary control provision found in the executive article of the Illinois Constitution (Ill. Const. 1970, art. V, \u00a721) is not the only constitutional provision relied on by the Director in his brief filed with this court; the Director would draw additional support from a similar provision appearing in the local government article of the Illinois Constitution (Ill. Const. 1970, art. VII, \u00a79(b)). Both provisions prohibit salary changes from taking effect during an officeholder\u2019s current term of office. The Director argues that the two provisions reflect the framers\u2019 views regarding the desirability of such a rule. The Director notes that his position is consistent with decisions under prior constitutional law (e.g., People v. Williams (1908), 232 Ill. 519), as well as with decisions characterizing the role of the State\u2019s Attorneys for separation of powers purposes as executive in nature (e.g., People ex rel. Daley v. Suria (1986), 112 Ill. 2d 26; People ex rel. Daley v. Moran (1983), 94 Ill. 2d 41). The Director warns that the failure to apply the salary control provisions of the executive and local government articles to State\u2019s Attorneys must mean that their salaries may be reduced, as well as increased, during their terms of office.</p> <p id=\"b382-3\" pgmap=\"382\">As the majority notes, the Illinois Constitution provides a variety of rules governing the compensation of different groups of public officials. The legislative, executive, and local government articles of the Illinois Constitution all contain provisions prohibiting changes in salaries from taking effect during the current terms of the persons subject to those restrictions. (See Ill. Const. 1970, art. IV, \u00a711 (\u201cA member shall receive a salary and allowances as provided by law, but changes in the salary of a member shall not take effect during the term for which he has been elected\u201d); art. V, \u00a721 (\u201cOfficers of the Executive Branch shall be paid salaries established by law and shall receive no other compensation for their services. Changes in the salaries of these officers elected or appointed for stated terms shall not take effect during the stated terms\u201d); art. VII, \u00a79(b) (\u201cAn increase or decrease in the salary of an elected officer of any unit of local government shall not take effect during the term for which that officer is elected\u201d).) A different rule applies to the salary of the auditor general, a position created under the finance article of the Constitution: the auditor general\u2019s salary may be increased, but not decreased, during his term of office. See Ill. Const. 1970, art. VIII, \u00a73(a) (\u201cHis compensation shall be established by law and shall not be diminished, but may be increased, to take effect during his term\u201d).</p> <p id=\"b382-4\" pgmap=\"382(61) 383(39)\">Article VI, the judicial article of the Constitution, contains several provisions governing the compensation of officers of the judicial branch of State government. Section 14 provides, \u201cJudges shall receive salaries provided by law which shall not be diminished to take effect during their terms of office.\u201d (Ill. Const. 1970, art. VI, \u00a714.) Section 18 provides, \u201cThe salaries of clerks and other non-judicial officers shall be as provided by law.\u201d (Ill. Const. 1970, art. VI, \u00a7 18(c).) Finally, section 19, concerning the officer of State\u2019s Attorney, says, \u201cHis salary shall be provided by law.\u201d Ill. Const. 1970, art. VI, \u00a719.</p> <p id=\"b383-3\" pgmap=\"383\">The same canons of construction helpful in the interpretation of statutory language are also helpful in the interpretation of constitutional language. (See Johnson v. State Electoral Board (1972), 53 Ill. 2d 256, 258-59; Wolfson v. Avery (1955), 6 Ill. 2d 78, 94; Peabody v. Russel (1922), 301 Ill. 439, 443.) It is apparent from a reading of the relevant provisions that the framers of the current constitution chose to employ different measures with respect to the compensation of various groups of public officials. Changes in the salaries of officeholders subject to the compensation provisions of the legislative, executive, and local government articles of the Constitution may not take effect during an officeholder\u2019s current term of office. Salaries of judges and of the auditor general may be increased, but not decreased, during an incumbent\u2019s term. Finally, the provisions governing the compensation of clerks of court, of other nonjudicial officers, and of State\u2019s Attorneys are silent on the matter of changes in their salaries.</p> <p id=\"b383-4\" pgmap=\"383\">It is evident that the framers did not intent to preclude the legislature from increasing the salaries of incumbent State\u2019s Attorneys during their terms of office. There is no reason to apply to article VI, section 19, the separate compensation provisions found in other portions of the Constitution. Thus, it is of no moment here that the State\u2019s Attorneys are classified, for other purposes, as members of the judicial branch or executive branch of State government. Finally, whether today\u2019s decision means that the State\u2019s Attorneys\u2019 salaries may also be reduced during their terms of office, as the Director contends, is not at issue here.</p> <p id=\"b383-5\" pgmap=\"383\">JUSTICE CALVO joins in this special concurrence.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
