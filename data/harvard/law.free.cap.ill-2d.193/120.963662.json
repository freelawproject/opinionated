Defendant was first tried for the May 1987 murder of John Goodman. The jury found defendant guilty of murder, armed robbery, and home invasion. The jury then found that defendant was eligible for the death penalty (seeIll. Rev. Stat. 1985, ch. 38, pars. 9 \u2014 1(b)(3), (b)(6)), and that there were no mitigating factors sufficient to preclude a sentence of death. The trial court therefore sentenced defendant to death for the murder conviction. The trial court imposed concurrent 60-year terms of imprisonment for defendant\u2019s remaining convictions. On direct appeal, this court affirmed defendant\u2019s convictions and sentences. People v. Page, 155 Ill. 2d 232 (1993) (Goodman case).</p> <p id=\"b136-5\" pgmap=\"136\">Defendant was next tried for the fall 1985 murder of Charles Howell. The jury found defendant guilty of murder and armed robbery. The jury also found that defendant was eligible for the death penalty (see Ill. Rev. Stat. 1985, ch. 38, pars. 9 \u2014 1(b)(3), (b)(6)), and that there were no mitigating factors sufficient to preclude a death sentence. The trial court sentenced defendant to death for the murder conviction and to an extended 60-year term of imprisonment for the armed robbery conviction. This court affirmed defendant\u2019s convictions and sentences on direct appeal. People v. Page, 156 Ill. 2d 258 (1993) (Howell case).</p> <p id=\"b136-6\" pgmap=\"136(93) 137(16)\">Defendant filed a pro se post-conviction petition in the Goodman case. Appointed counsel filed a post-conviction petition in the Howell case. Appointed counsel later filed a supplemental post-conviction petition that consolidated the issues in both cases. The State filed a motion to dismiss the post-conviction petition in each case. Appointed counsel subsequently filed a consolidated amended post-conviction petition that superseded all prior post-conviction petitions but refers to exhibits attached to those earlier petitions. The State filed a motion to dismiss the consolidated amended post-conviction petition (post-conviction petition). After hearing arguments on the State\u2019s motion, the trial court dismissed defendant\u2019s post-conviction petition without an evidentiaryhearing.</p> <p id=\"b137-5\" pgmap=\"137\">Defendant now appeals from the dismissal of his post-conviction petition. For the reasons set forth below, we affirm the trial court\u2019s dismissal of defendant\u2019s post-conviction petition.</p> <p id=\"b137-6\" pgmap=\"137\">BACKGROUND</p> <p id=\"b137-7\" pgmap=\"137\">The facts relating to defendant\u2019s trials are set forth in this court\u2019s opinions on direct appeal. Because an understanding of some of the trial evidence is necessary to evaluate defendant\u2019s arguments in this post-conviction proceeding, we present a summary of that evidence.</p> <p id=\"b137-8\" pgmap=\"137\">Defendant has been convicted of three murders, the Goodman and Howell murders at issue in this case, as well as the murder of Dale Andrew Devine. On May 16, 1987, defendant was arrested by the Olympia Fields police department as part of the investigation into Goodman\u2019s murder. Over the next several days, defendant gave law enforcement authorities several statements admitting his involvement in the three murders. On two occasions during that time, defendant led Olympia Fields police officers on an unsuccessful search of the area in Wisconsin where defendant claimed that he buried Goodman\u2019s body.</p> <p id=\"b137-9\" pgmap=\"137(96) 138(29)\">On May 19, 1987, defendant gave a court-reported statement in which he confessed to the three murders. Defendant revealed that, during the fall of 1985, defendant, Kenneth Cheney, and Gerald Feinberg murdered Devine. Devine and Cheney became involved in a drug deal in which Devine apparently \u201cripped off\u2019 Cheney. Devine was residing with defendant at this time. Defendant contacted Feinberg and told him that Devine was at his house. Feinberg came to defendant\u2019s house, and defendant and Feinberg tied up Devine with an extension cord. Defendant then called Cheney and told him that Devine was at his house. Cheney came over and, using a hypodermic needle, injected Devine with barbiturates. Defendant took approximately $100 from Devine\u2019s pocket and gave it to Cheney.</p> <p id=\"b138-5\" pgmap=\"138\">Defendant, Feinberg, and Cheney then transported Devine to a wooded area near Wilmington, Illinois. Cheney asked Devine how he wanted to die, either by being stabbed with a knife or by being injected with a hypodermic needle. Devine indicated that he preferred the injection. Cheney attempted to inject an air bubble into Devine\u2019s bloodstream. When this did not kill Devine, Cheney slit Devine\u2019s throat with the knife. Cheney then directed defendant and Feinberg to stab Devine, which they did. After the murder, defendant, Cheney, and Feinberg drove to Cheney\u2019s home, where they drank alcohol and smoked marijuana. Two days later, defendant and Cheney returned to the murder scene, and Cheney poured gasoline on Devine\u2019s body and set it on fire. Defendant was convicted in the circuit court of Will County of the murder of Devine, and was sentenced to a 60-year term of imprisonment. The appellate court affirmed defendant\u2019s murder conviction and sentence. People v. Page, 196 Ill. App. 3d 285 (1990) (Devine case).</p> <p id=\"b138-6\" pgmap=\"138(119) 139(116)\">Defendant also confessed to the fall 1985 murder of Charles Howell. Defendant stated that he and Feinberg killed Howell because Howell had been a roommate of Devine, and Devine\u2019s disappearance would make Howell suspicious. Defendant and Feinberg decided to murder Howell and bury him in a forest preserve in Park Forest, Illinois. Defendant and Feinberg planned the murder in advance by drawing a map of the area where they would bury Howell, taking shovels from defendant\u2019s home and from the home of a neighbor, going to the planned burial site in advance to dig a hole, and luring Howell to the site under the pretense of having a party and engaging in a drug transaction there. Defendant stabbed Howell, and Feinberg hit him in the head with a large stick. Defendant and Feinberg laid Howell in the hole that they had dug, covered him with dirt and branches, and started a fire over the grave with lighter fluid. Feinberg, who had taken Howell\u2019s car keys from the pocket of Howell\u2019s jeans prior to burying him, gave the keys to defendant as they were leaving the forest preserve. Defendant stated that he wanted the keys because Howell\u2019s car was parked in front of defendant\u2019s house. After the murder, defendant and Feinberg went to defendant\u2019s house, smoked marijuana, and drove around in Howell\u2019s car. A few days later, defendant sold Howell\u2019s car to a junkyard.</p> <p id=\"b139-5\" pgmap=\"139\">Defendant\u2019s statement also included a confession to the murder of John Goodman. Defendant stated that, on May 6, 1987, he and Feinberg made plans to rob and kill Goodman. Defendant originated the plan because he had a grudge against Goodman. On Thursday, May 7, 1987, defendant and Feinberg visited Goodman\u2019s home in Olympia Fields. When Goodman was in another room, defendant displayed a knife to Feinberg. Defendant then approached Goodman and asked Goodman about some photographs that Goodman had taken of defendant. When Goodman began to laugh, defendant stabbed him in the chest four times. Defendant said that Goodman had not touched him prior to that.</p> <p id=\"b139-6\" pgmap=\"139\">Defendant and Feinberg then put Goodman\u2019s body in the bathtub while they wiped the house clean of their fingerprints. They stole credit cards and cash from Goodman\u2019s wallet. They wrapped Goodman\u2019s body in a sheet and a rug and placed the body in the trunk of Goodman\u2019s car. Defendant and Feinberg obtained a shovel and a can of gasoline and left in Goodman\u2019s car. After stopping at a tavern in southeastern Wisconsin to eat and play pool, they drove to a rural area in Wisconsin, dug a hole, and buried Goodman\u2019s body. They then burned the sheet and rug over the grave.</p> <p id=\"b140-4\" pgmap=\"140\">Defendant further stated that, on May 9, 1987, he and a friend transported some electronic equipment from Goodman\u2019s house to defendant\u2019s father\u2019s house. Defendant described his and his friends\u2019 use of Goodman\u2019s credit cards during the weekend following the murder. Defendant and Feinberg abandoned Goodman\u2019s car at a commuter station the following Tuesday or Wednesday.</p> <p id=\"b140-5\" pgmap=\"140\">As discussed, defendant was convicted of all three murders and received the death penalty for the murders of Goodman and Howell. This appeal follows the dismissal of defendant\u2019s post-conviction petition without an evidentiary hearing in the Goodman and Howell cases. For the reasons set forth below, we hold that the trial court properly dismissed defendant\u2019s post-conviction petition without an evidentiary hearing. We therefore affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p> <p id=\"b140-6\" pgmap=\"140\">ANALYSIS</p> <p id=\"b140-7\" pgmap=\"140\">The Post-Conviction Hearing Act (725 ILCS 5/122 \u2014 1 et seq. (West 1998)) provides a remedy to criminal defendants who claim that substantial violations of their federal or state constitutional rights occurred in their trial or sentencing hearing. People v. Towns, 182 Ill. 2d 491, 502 (1998). A post-conviction action, however, is a collateral proceeding, not an appeal from the underlying judgment. Towns, 182 Ill. 2d at 502. The purpose of the post-conviction proceeding is to allow inquiry into constitutional issues involved in the conviction and sentence that have not been, and could not have been, adjudicated previously on direct appeal. Towns, 182 Ill. 2d at 502. The doctrine of res judicata bars consideration of issues that were raised and decided on direct appeal. Towns, 182 Ill. 2d at 502; People v. Griffin, 178 Ill. 2d 65, 73 (1997). Issues that could have been presented on direct appeal, but were not, are waived. Towns, 182 Ill. 2d at 503; Griffin, 178 Ill. 2d at 73.</p> <p id=\"b140-8\" pgmap=\"140(9) 141(173)\">A defendant is not entitled to an evidentiary hearing on a post-conviction petition as a matter of right. People v. Hobley, 182 Ill. 2d 404, 427-28 (1998). Rather, an evidentiary hearing is warranted only where the allegations of the post-conviction petition, supported where appropriate by the trial record or accompanying affidavits, make a substantial showing that the defendant\u2019s constitutional rights have been violated. Hobley, 182 Ill. 2d at 428; Towns, 182 Ill. 2d at 503. In determining whether to grant an evidentiary hearing, all well-pleaded facts in the petition and in any accompanying affidavits are taken as true. Towns, 182 Ill. 2d at 503. Assertions that are nonfactual and nonspecific and that merely amount to conclusions are not sufficient to require an evidentiary hearing. People v. Coleman, 183 Ill. 2d 366, 381 (1998). A trial court\u2019s determination regarding the sufficiency of the allegations contained in a post-conviction petition is reviewed de novo. Coleman, 183 Ill. 2d at 388-89. With these principles in mind, we review de novo the trial court\u2019s dismissal of defendant\u2019s post-conviction petition without an evidentiary hearing.</p> <p id=\"b141-5\" pgmap=\"141\">I. Ineffective Assistance of Counsel</p> <p id=\"b141-6\" pgmap=\"141\">Defendant first raises a series of challenges to the effectiveness of his counsel during trial, sentencing, and on direct appeal.</p> <p id=\"b141-7\" pgmap=\"141\">To establish a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, a defendant must first show that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient in that it fell below an objective standard of reasonableness. Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 687-88, 80 L. Ed. 2d 674, 693, 104 S. Ct. 2052, 2064 (1984). In satisfying this prong, a defendant must overcome the strong presumption that the challenged action or inaction of counsel was the product of sound trial strategy. Strickland, 466 U.S. at 689, 80 L. Ed. 2d at 694-95, 104 S. Ct. at 2065.</p> <p id=\"b141-8\" pgmap=\"141(17) 142(132)\">A defendant must also establish prejudice by proving that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s deficient performance, the result of the proceeding would have been different. Strickland, 466 U.S. at 694, 80 L. Ed. 2d at 698, 104 S. Ct. at 2068. A reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome; namely, that counsel\u2019s deficient performance either rendered the result of the trial unreliable or rendered the proceeding fundamentally unfair. Strickland, 466 U.S. at 694, 80 L. Ed. 2d at 698, 104 S. Ct. at 2068. When challenging a death sentence, a defendant must prove that there is a reasonable probability that, absent counsel\u2019s deficient performance, the sentencer would have concluded that the balance of aggravating and mitigating circumstances did not warrant death. Strickland, 466 U.S. at 695, 80 L. Ed. 2d at 698, 104 S. Ct. at 2069.</p> <p id=\"b142-5\" pgmap=\"142\">A defendant must establish both prongs of the Strickland test to prevail on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. A court, however, may resolve an ineffectiveness claim by reaching only the prejudice prong, as lack of prejudice renders irrelevant the issue of counsel\u2019s alleged deficient performance. See Strickland, 466 U.S. at 697, 80 L. Ed. 2d at 699, 104 S. Ct. at 2069.</p> <p id=\"b142-6\" pgmap=\"142\">A. Failure to Present Sufficient Evidence of a Voluntary Manslaughter Defense</p> <p id=\"b142-7\" pgmap=\"142(78) 143(78)\">Defendant argues that trial counsel was ineffective during the Goodman trial for failing to present sufficient evidence to support defendant\u2019s voluntary manslaughter theory of defense. At the time of the offense, the homicide statute provided that a person commits voluntary manslaughter if at the time of the killing he either had an actual but unreasonable belief regarding the need for self-defense, or was acting under a sudden and intense passion resulting from serious provocation. Ill. Rev. Stat. 1985, ch. 38, par. 9 \u2014 2.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Serious provocation is conduct sufficient to excite an intense passion in a reasonable person. 111. Rev. Stat. 1985, ch. 38, par. 9 \u2014 2. This court has recognized the following categories of provocation: substantial physical injury or substantial physical assault; mutual quarrel or combat; illegal arrest; and adultery with the offender\u2019s spouse. People v. Garcia, 165 Ill. 2d 409, 429 (1995); People v. Chevalier, 131 Ill. 2d 66, 71 (1989).</p> <p id=\"b143-5\" pgmap=\"143\">During the opening argument in the Goodman trial, defense counsel told the jury that defendant had committed the homicide charged, but maintained that defendant was guilty of voluntary manslaughter rather than murder. Later, however, the trial court denied defendant\u2019s request that the jury be instructed on voluntary manslaughter, finding that the evidence was not sufficient to support the instruction. The trial court also directed defense counsel not to argue the theory of voluntary manslaughter in summation.</p> <p id=\"b143-6\" pgmap=\"143(101) 144(147)\">On direct appeal in the Goodman case, defendant argued that his trial counsel was ineffective for presenting the voluntary manslaughter theory of defense. Defendant argued that this theory was not supported by either the law or the facts of the case. This court noted that trial counsel sought to demonstrate that defendant killed Goodman while defendant was acting under a sudden and intense passion resulting from serious provocation. Page, 155 Ill. 2d at 261. Trial counsel sought to establish the provocation form of the offense by showing evidence of mutual combat between defendant and Goodman. Page, 155 Ill. 2d at 261. Although defendant did not testify, trial counsel was able to elicit evidence, during cross-examination of one of the prosecution witnesses, about an altercation between defendant and Goodman. Trial counsel asked the witness about an inculpatory statement made by defendant prior to his formal confession. In that statement, defendant said that he and Goodman argued for 10 to 15 minutes over some photographs that Goodman refused to surrender. According to defendant, Goodman had taken photographs of defendant and Goodman having a homosexual relationship. Defendant said that he punched and stabbed Goodman when Goodman refused to move from the bathroom doorway, where the two were standing. In addition to this evidence, defendant, in his formal statement, said that he stabbed Goodman after Goodman began laughing at his request for the photographs. See Page, 155 Ill. 2d at 261.</p> <p id=\"b144-5\" pgmap=\"144(147) 145(13)\">This court rejected defendant\u2019s argument that trial counsel was ineffective for arguing voluntary manslaughter. We held that trial counsel\u2019s decision to present the voluntary manslaughter defense was a matter of trial strategy, and that the record showed that defendant expressly consented to this strategy. Page, 155 Ill. 2d at 262-63. We found that, in light of the overwhelming evidence of defendant\u2019s involvement in Goodman\u2019s murder, defense counsel might reasonably have considered a voluntary manslaughter theory to be the only reasonable course of defense. Page, 155 Ill. 2d at 262. We then recounted the overwhelming evidence of defendant\u2019s guilt. Defendant confessed in detail to the crimes. An eyewitness saw defendant at Goodman\u2019s house shortly before Goodman disappeared. Other witnesses established that defendant was in possession of property belonging to Goodman, including his car and credit cards. Another witness testified that defendant had access to Goodman\u2019s house shortly after he disappeared. See Page, 155 Ill. 2d at 266.</p> <p id=\"b145-5\" pgmap=\"145\">In these post-conviction proceedings, defendant now argues that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to present sufficient evidence to support the voluntary manslaughter defense. Defendant has waived review of this argument by failing to raise it on direct appeal. See People v. Towns, 182 Ill. 2d 491, 503 (1998). Indeed, this argument is directly contrary to the argument defendant did raise on direct appeal, i.e., that trial counsel was ineffective for presenting the voluntary manslaughter defense.</p> <p id=\"b145-6\" pgmap=\"145\">Defendant, however, appears to argue that his claim is not waived because it is based on evidence outside the original trial record. This exception to the waiver rule in post-conviction appeals refers to those claims that the reviewing court on direct appeal could not have considered because the claim\u2019s evidentiary basis was de hors the record. See People v. Whitehead, 169 Ill. 2d 355, 372 (1996), overruled in part on other grounds, People v. Coleman, 183 Ill. 2d 366 (1998). Defendant argues that there was evidence available to trial counsel to substantiate defendant\u2019s voluntary manslaughter defense. Defendant claims that he has now \u201csubmitted police reports and evidence of other statements, from numerous individuals, substantiating and establishing the manslaughter defense, including: evidence that the pictures being argued over were evidence of a homosexual attack perpetrated by the victim and his friends; evidence that such tendencies and similar photographs were discovered concerning the victim (as well as additional material involving the defendants); and evidence that in addition to an altercation over the pictures, the victim attempted homosexual contact with the defendant.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b145-7\" pgmap=\"145(27) 146(55)\">The evidence that defendant cites in support of his argument is as follows. Defendant provides his own affidavit which states that \u201cJohn Goodman had pictures of Gerald Feinberg. Cheyney [sic] told Gerald that if he helped Cheyney get Andy and Chuck, Cheyney would help Gerald get Goodman for what he had done to him. John Goodman and his friend had drugged Feinberg and performed unnatural sex acts on him. Feinberg was very upset about this, and wanted to get them back.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b146-5\" pgmap=\"146\">Defendant attaches the affidavit of Edward Torres, an investigator from the Capital Litigation Division. Torres interviewed Kenneth Berksen, who was once Gerald Feinberg\u2019s cellmate at the Cook County jail. According to Torres\u2019 affidavit, Berksen stated that Feinberg told him that, on the night of Goodman\u2019s murder, Goodman made a sexual advance toward defendant, which enraged defendant and caused defendant to stab Goodman. In this regard, defendant also provides a report from the Olympia Fields police department which relates that Greg Wilson, a friend of Goodman, spoke to a man named John Dixon, who spoke to Feinberg, who said that \u201cGoodman tried to make out with Pat Page, and then they stabbed him.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b146-6\" pgmap=\"146\">Defendant also cites numerous other reports from the Olympia Fields police department which discuss relations among defendant, Goodman, and Feinberg. One report recounts that a certain newspaper reporter gave the Olympia Fields police department a photograph of Goodman and defendant. The reporter received the photograph from a third party who had received it from the photographer. The reporter advised police that the source had stated that the photograph was taken one week before Goodman\u2019s murder while on a weekend fishing trip in Illinois. Another report discusses information received from Greg Wilson. According to Wilson, defendant had been to Goodman\u2019s home and had been videotaped in one of Goodman\u2019s \u201chome movies.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b146-7\" pgmap=\"146(16) 147(138)\">An additional report from the Olympia Fields police department describes an interview with Glen Rogers, a friend of Goodman. Rogers stated that he led a homosexual lifestyle which included a relationship with Feinberg, and that approximately one month prior to the interview, Goodman told Rogers that Goodman and Feinberg had a sexual encounter the previous weekend. One report discusses Goodman\u2019s homosexual lifestyle and the police department\u2019s possession of photographs of Goodman with Glen Rogers and an unidentified nude male. Another report describes a telephone call that the police department received from an individual named Bill Davis. Davis \u201cwanted to know why the S&amp;M angle of this homicide has not been followed up on in the news media.\u201d According to Davis, Goodman \u201cused to hang out\u201d at a Chicago bar \u201cfrequented by \u2018male hustlers\u2019 with homosexual and S&amp;M tendencies.\u201d Davis recognized defendant and Feinberg as being patrons of this bar.</p> <p id=\"b147-5\" pgmap=\"147\">The other evidence that defendant cites in support of his current argument references personal details of Goodman\u2019s lifestyle. Defendant has attached an affidavit from Appolon Beaudouin, Jr., an investigator for the Capital Litigation Division. This affidavit references Beaudouin\u2019s interview with Michelle Kury, defendant\u2019s former girlfriend. According to Beaudouin, Kury stated that \u201cPatrick told her that Goodman was into sex videos.\u201d Defendant further cites a report from the Olympia Fields police department that lists property recovered from Goodman\u2019s home. The list of property references \u201cpornographic homosexual assorted photos\u201d and a \u201ccopy of Gay Chicago Magazine for January, 87.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b147-6\" pgmap=\"147\">Defendant argues that, had trial counsel presented this evidence, he would have been entitled to a jury instruction on voluntary manslaughter. We hold that defendant has failed to make a substantial showing that he was prejudiced by trial counsel\u2019s failure to present this evidence.</p> <p id=\"b147-7\" pgmap=\"147(7) 148(175)\">Defendant\u2019s argument is that this evidence would have supported a defense that he killed Goodman while acting under a sudden and intense passion resulting from serious provocation. Defendant\u2019s theory of provocation appears to be that Goodman made unwanted sexual advances toward him on the night of the murder. The only evidence that could have supported this theory is (1) the affidavit from the Capital Litigation Division investigator which recounts that a former cellmate of Feinberg stated that Feinberg told him that, on the night of Goodman\u2019s murder, Goodman made a sexual advance toward defendant which enraged defendant and caused defendant to stab Goodman; and (2) the police report which relates that Greg Wilson spoke to a man named John Dixon, who spoke to Feinberg, who said that \u201cGoodman tried to make out with Pat Page, and then they stabbed him.\u201d The remaining evidence is simply not evidence that Goodman made an unwanted sexual advance toward defendant on the night of the murder. Indeed, defendant\u2019s own affidavit states that Goodman performed unwanted sexual acts on Feinberg, not on defendant.</p> <p id=\"b148-5\" pgmap=\"148(146) 149(58)\">Even focusing on the evidence that could have supported defendant\u2019s theory of provocation, and accepting all of this evidence as true, we hold that defendant has failed to make a substantial showing that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to present this alleged evidence of voluntary manslaughter. Initially, we note that this evidence is hearsay and would likely not have been admissible at defendant\u2019s trial. Defendant has failed to provide an affidavit from Feinberg attesting to the information which has been attributed to him, and stating that he would have been willing to testify to this information at defendant\u2019s trial. In any event, defendant\u2019s theory is that he killed Goodman while he was acting under a sudden and intense passion resulting from serious provocation. Defendant argues that the provocation here is that Goodman made sexual advances toward him. This is not one of the categories of provocation that this court has recognized. See Garcia, 165 Ill. 2d at 429; Chevalier, 131 Ill. 2d at 71. Thus, even if evidence that Goodman made a sexual advance toward defendant on the night of the murder had been admitted at trial, this evidence would not have entitled defendant to a voluntary manslaughter instruction.</p> <p id=\"b149-5\" pgmap=\"149\">Defendant, however, argues that, in People v. Saldivar, 113 Ill. 2d 256 (1986), and in People v. Lenser, 102 Ill. App. 3d 214 (1981), the defendants received jury instructions for voluntary manslaughter in cases similar to defendant\u2019s case. Although Saldivar and Lenser involved fact scenarios where the victim made a homosexual advance toward the defendants, the question of whether the evidence was sufficient to entitle the defendants to a voluntary manslaughter instruction was not at issue. Also, in Saldivar, the stipulated evidence revealed that the defendant stated that, after the victim made the sexual advance, \u201ca struggle ensued,\u201d and the defendant stabbed the victim with a kitchen knife. Saldivar, 113 Ill. 2d at 260-61. Thus, it appears that the defendant received the voluntary manslaughter instruction on the basis of mutual combat, not the sexual advance.</p> <p id=\"b149-6\" pgmap=\"149\">Defendant cites additional cases which he contends \u201cdiscuss what could be termed the \u2018homosexual panic\u2019 defense and demonstrate the accepted use of this \u2018defense\u2019 to obtain a manslaughter instruction.\u201d While these cases likewise involve fact scenarios where the victims made homosexual adv\u00e1nces toward the defendants, the defendants\u2019 theories of voluntary manslaughter were based on the unreasonable belief in the need for self-defense, not on serious provocation, which is the theory advanced by defendant in this case. See, e.g., People v. Henne, 23 Ill. App. 3d 567 (1974); People v. Barnes, 23 Ill. App. 3d 390 (1974). These cases, therefore, are inapposite.</p> <p id=\"b150-4\" pgmap=\"150\">For the foregoing reasons, we hold that defendant has failed to make a substantial showing that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to present the alleged evidence of voluntary manslaughter.</p> <p id=\"b150-5\" pgmap=\"150\">B. Failure to Adequately Present Defendant\u2019s Motion to Suppress His Confession</p> <p id=\"b150-6\" pgmap=\"150\">Defendant argues that trial counsel was ineffective in both the Goodman and Howell cases in presenting defendant\u2019s motion to suppress his confession. We note that defendant was represented by the same two attorneys in both the Goodman and Howell cases. The facts relevant to this issue are outlined extensively in our opinions on direct appeal. See People v. Page, 156 Ill. 2d 258, 284-85 (1993) (Howell case); People v. Page, 155 Ill. 2d 232, 246-59 (1993) (Goodman case). We review those facts necessary to address defendant\u2019s argument in this appeal.</p> <p id=\"b150-7\" pgmap=\"150\">Defendant was arrested around 10 p.m. on Saturday, May 16, 1987, and remained in police custody, in Cook County, until May 20, when he was taken before a judge for a bond hearing. Defendant gave law enforcement officers numerous statements with respect to the Goodman murder on May 16, 17, 18, and 19. On May 19, defendant also gave authorities formal statements regarding the murder of Andrew Devine, committed in Will County, and the murder of Charles Howell, committed in Cook County.</p> <p id=\"b150-8\" pgmap=\"150(80) 151(31)\">The first case to go to trial was the Will County prosecution for Devine\u2019s murder. In that proceeding, defendant moved to suppress his statements. Defendant\u2019s motion did not specify which statements were being challenged. In his motion, defendant argued that the interrogating officers made unfulfilled promises of leniency; that defendant was led to believe that the only court proceedings in which his statements would be used would be those in which the promises of leniency would be enforced; that the officers did not honor his wishes to consult with an attorney; and that the officers threatened to charge defendant\u2019s father with the offenses in the Goodman case.</p> <p id=\"b151-5\" pgmap=\"151\">The Will County trial court held a hearing at which the parties introduced testimony regarding the entire time period during which defendant was in custody. The State presented the testimony of three members of the Olympia Fields police department, the assistant State\u2019s Attorney who had questioned defendant in all three cases, and the court reporter who had transcribed defendant\u2019s formal statements to the Devine and Howell murders. These witnesses testified that defendant received Miranda warnings and waived these rights prior to each session of questioning, and that defendant was not mistreated while in custody. These witnesses further denied that any promises of leniency were made to defendant or that he or his family members were threatened in any way.</p> <p id=\"b151-6\" pgmap=\"151\">Defendant testified at the suppression hearing. Defendant stated that, shortly after he was taken into custody, the police showed defendant a booking photograph of his father and told defendant that his father would be charged in the Goodman case if defendant did not confess. We note that defendant\u2019s father had been arrested when police learned that property belonging to Goodman was in defendant\u2019s father\u2019s home. Defendant\u2019s father was released soon after defendant\u2019s arrest. At the suppression hearing, defendant also testified that the police refused defendant\u2019s request to contact an attorney or a family member. Defendant further testified that, prior to making the statements regarding the Devine and Howell cases, the assistant State\u2019s Attorney promised defendant that he would receive only a 20-year sentence for those offenses if he confessed to the crimes.</p> <p id=\"b151-7\" pgmap=\"151(8) 152(78)\">Defendant\u2019s mother and sister testified on behalf of defendant at the suppression hearing. They stated that during the weekend of defendant\u2019s arrest, they repeatedly called the Olympia Fields police department, and their requests to speak with defendant were denied. The defense also presented the testimony of Leila Naszkiewicz, the mother of Michael Naszkiewicz, who had also been arrested in connection with the Goodman murder. Leila Naszkiewicz testified that she too encountered difficulty in attempting to contact her son while he was in police custody.</p> <p id=\"b152-5\" pgmap=\"152\">Following the suppression hearing, the Will County trial court denied defendant\u2019s motion to suppress his statements. The trial court held that defendant had given his statements voluntarily. The trial court did not distinguish among the different statements made by defendant.</p> <p id=\"b152-6\" pgmap=\"152\">Subsequently, in both the Cook County Howell and Goodman cases, defendant moved to suppress his statements. The trial court in both cases granted the State\u2019s motion to strike defendant\u2019s motion to suppress. The trial court in both cases held that the Will County trial court had already resolved the admissibility of defendant\u2019s statements, and that defendant was therefore collaterally estopped from challenging that determination.</p> <p id=\"b152-7\" pgmap=\"152(105) 153(64)\">On direct appeal in the Goodman case, this court extensively reviewed this issue and concluded that the Will County trial court, in rejecting defendant\u2019s claims, \u201cnecessarily determined issues pertinent to all three sets of statements made by the defendant while in police custody.\u201d Page, 155 Ill. 2d at 254. This court stated that \u201cwe have carefully examined the evidence and arguments presented at the Will County suppression hearing. Our analysis leads us to conclude that the Will County judge\u2019s ruling on the admissibility of the Devine statements resolved as well factual issues pertinent to the Goodman and Howell statements.\u201d Page, 155 Ill. 2d at 257. Likewise, on direct appeal in the Howell case, this court stated that \u201c[w]e have carefully examined the record of the Will County proceedings and the record in the instant case and have found nothing to dissuade us from our earlier conclusion\u201d in the Goodman case that defendant is collaterally estopped from challenging the admissibility of his statements. Page, 156 Ill. 2d at 285.</p> <p id=\"b153-5\" pgmap=\"153\">Defendant argues in these post-conviction proceedings that trial counsel was ineffective in both the Goodman and Howell cases in presenting the motions to suppress defendant\u2019s statements. Defendant contends that he has made a substantial showing that, had trial counsel presented certain other evidence, the trial court would not have held that defendant was collaterally estopped from challenging the admissibility of his statements. Defendant suggests that this new evidence includes \u201cthe extensive searches and cooperation with authorities in searching for the Goodman and Howell bodies; their promises relating to these searches; and the additional conversations on these outings.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b153-6\" pgmap=\"153(141) 154(36)\">We review the evidence that defendant now cites in support of his argument that trial counsel was ineffective in presenting his motion to suppress his statements in Cook County. Defendant attaches his own affidavit in which he repeats allegations to which he testified at the suppression hearing. In this affidavit, defendant also states that he rehearsed his statements both before and after the court reporter arrived. Defendant states that, before the court reporter arrived, the assistant State\u2019s Attorney reminded defendant that he would help defendant \u201cget 20 [years] or less.\u201d However, the assistant State\u2019s Attorney told defendant that \u201csince he could not promise me anything, [h]e would have to ask me if there was a promise, that I would have to say no.\u201d Defendant further alleges that he \u201cfound that Michael Naszkiewicz and Michelle Kury repeatedly asked for attorneys and Michael\u2019s mother tried to get an attorney, but the police would not let her.\u201d Finally, defendant states that he \u201cwas told that my family and I would be killed if I did not take the rap.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b154-5\" pgmap=\"154\">Defendant also references an affidavit from the investigator for the Capital Litigation Division, who interviewed Michelle Kury on June 13, 1997. During this interview, Kury stated that she was in the Village of Matteson jail for four days and could not get an attorney or talk to her family for that period of time.</p> <p id=\"b154-6\" pgmap=\"154\">Defendant further cites a report from the Olympia Fields police department which discusses a May 15, 1987, meeting between a police officer and Leila Naszkiewicz, whose son Michael was in custody at the time. Naszkiewicz apparently requested that she be notified when her son had a bond hearing, and requested information regarding representation for her son by the public defender\u2019s office. Naszkiewicz was advised that her son was being held on burglary charges but that the charges could change as the investigation progressed.</p> <p id=\"b154-7\" pgmap=\"154\">In this regard, defendant attaches an affidavit from his brother. His brother states that when defendant \u201cwas in the Richton Park jail, my mother and I tried to see him and the police almost arrested me for sitting in the parking lot. They held Pat [defendant] for at least 72 hours, and told me that he had not been charged, he did not need a lawyer and did not need to see anyone.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b154-8\" pgmap=\"154\">Defendant also attaches an affidavit from his father. His father relates that defendant told him that he confessed to the crimes because the police showed him a picture of his father in a jail cell. Finally, defendant cites two Olympia Fields police department reports which recount that defendant was transported to Wisconsin to search for Goodman\u2019s body. These reports also state that defendant voluntarily gave statements after being advised of his Miranda rights.</p> <p id=\"b155-4\" pgmap=\"155\">Defendant fails to explain how any of this evidence would have resulted in a holding by the trial court that defendant was not collaterally estopped from challenging the admissibility of his statements. Most of this evidence is cumulative of the evidence that the trial court considered, and which this court reviewed, in determining that defendant was collaterally estopped from relitigating his motion to suppress his statements. The other evidence, namely, the circumstances surrounding the arrests of Michelle Kury and Michael Naszkiewicz, is simply not relevant to a determination of the voluntariness of defendant\u2019s statements.</p> <p id=\"b155-5\" pgmap=\"155\">We therefore hold that defendant has failed to make a substantial showing that, had trial counsel presented this evidence, there is a reasonable probability that the trial court would not have held that defendant was collaterally estopped from challenging the admissibility of his statements.</p> <p id=\"b155-6\" pgmap=\"155\">We note that defendant also suggests in this regard that trial counsel in the Howell and Goodman cases were ineffective for failing to ensure that appellate counsel in the Devine case challenged the admissibility of defendant\u2019s statements. In the Devine case, defendant did not receive the death penalty. Thus, defendant\u2019s appeal in that case was heard by the appellate court. See People v. Page, 196 Ill. App. 3d 285 (1990). Appellate counsel in the Devine case did not challenge the admissibility of defendant\u2019s statements. Defendant now argues that trial counsel in the Goodman and Howell cases \u201cfailed to insure that some level of appellate review was had of these statements,\u201d and that as a result of this \u201cfailure,\u201d the issue of the admissibility of defendant\u2019s statements was never reviewed. This, of course, is an improper argument, as we are not reviewing the Devine case. Furthermore, defendant fails to offer any argument to support the notion that a challenge to the admissibility of his statements would have been successful.</p> <p id=\"b156-4\" pgmap=\"156\">As a final matter, defendant suggests that trial counsel were ineffective for failing to adequately present defendant\u2019s motion to quash his arrest and suppress evidence. Defendant attaches police reports regarding the taking of defendant into custody, and the obtainment of permission from defendant\u2019s mother to search her house.</p> <p id=\"b156-5\" pgmap=\"156\">The Will County trial court denied defendant\u2019s motion to quash his arrest and suppress evidence. On direct appeal in the Goodman case, we noted that the trial court in the Goodman case granted the State\u2019s motion to strike defendant\u2019s motion to quash his arrest and suppress evidence on the basis that defendant was collaterally estopped from challenging the Will County trial court\u2019s prior determination. See People v. Page, 155 Ill. 2d 232, 248 (1993) (Goodman case). We further noted that the Cook County trial court\u2019s disposition of defendant\u2019s motion to quash his arrest and suppress evidence was not at issue in the appeal. Page, 155 Ill. 2d at 248.</p> <p id=\"b156-6\" pgmap=\"156\">Defendant offers no argument to support his suggestion that trial counsel were ineffective for failing to adequately present defendant\u2019s motion to quash his arrest and suppress evidence. We therefore hold that defendant has waived any argument in this regard. See 177 Ill. 2d R. 341(e)(7) (stating that an appellant\u2019s brief must include an argument, \u201cwhich shall contain the contentions of the appellant and the reasons therefor\u201d).</p> <p id=\"b156-7\" pgmap=\"156\">C. Failure to Present Mitigating Evidence</p> <p id=\"b156-8\" pgmap=\"156(72) 157(24)\">Defendant argues that he has made a substantial showing that trial counsel was ineffective at sentencing in both the Goodman and Howell cases for failing to present certain mitigating evidence. The alleged mitigating evidence to which defendant cites includes information regarding defendant\u2019s involvement in a cult and the interplay of that cult involvement with defendant\u2019s psychiatric history. Defendant contends that, had trial counsel presented this evidence at the sentencing hearings, there is a reasonable probability that the jurors would have concluded that the balance of aggravating and mitigating circumstances did not warrant death.</p> <p id=\"b157-5\" pgmap=\"157\">The following is the evidence that was presented in mitigation at defendant\u2019s sentencing hearings in the Goodman and Howell cases. In the Goodman case, Arlene Messner-Peters, a social worker, testified regarding a mitigation report that she prepared at the request of trial counsel. She interviewed defendant\u2019s family members, reviewed material from the Department of Corrections, and reviewed defendant\u2019s confessions. MessnerPeters testified that defendant\u2019s childhood was unstable. Defendant\u2019s parents were often involved in physical altercations with each other. Defendant\u2019s father was an alcoholic and would become abusive toward his wife and children.</p> <p id=\"b157-6\" pgmap=\"157\">Messner-Peters also testified regarding defendant\u2019s difficulties in school, both academically and socially. Defendant suffered from a learning disability. Also, a congenital condition affecting defendant\u2019s eye muscles had caused defendant\u2019s eyes to drift apart and to cross. The children at school teased defendant because of this condition. Defendant also had a history of using marijuana and LSD.</p> <p id=\"b157-7\" pgmap=\"157\">Dr. Gerard Girdaukas, a licensed clinical psychologist, testified that he administered psychological tests to defendant and diagnosed him with a learning disability and with a \u201cnon-specific personality disorder.\u201d Defendant exhibited symptoms of depression, paranoia, delusional thinking, and organic brain impairment. Dr. Girdaukas concluded that defendant was under the influence of extreme emotional disturbance at the time of the Goodman murder. Dr. Girdaukas recommended that defendant take antipsychotic medication and attend support groups, and he recommended further testing.</p> <p id=\"b157-8\" pgmap=\"157(7) 158(55)\">Defendant\u2019s parents, Paul and Patricia Page, and defendant\u2019s sister, Grace Page, testified on defendant\u2019s behalf. Their testimony reiterated the evidence regarding defendant\u2019s academic and social problems. The testimony also revealed that defendant\u2019s parents separated when defendant was eight years old. Defendant lived with each parent at various times in his childhood. The testimony further described defendant\u2019s father\u2019s alcoholism, abusive behavior, and infidelity.</p> <p id=\"b158-5\" pgmap=\"158\">A neighbor also testified regarding her relationship with defendant\u2019s family, and about defendant\u2019s good nature. Further, a clergyman, who had visited defendant while he was an inmate at the Cook County jail, testified about defendant\u2019s interest in religion and his desire to be baptized.</p> <p id=\"b158-6\" pgmap=\"158\">At the sentencing hearing in the Howell case, defendant presented almost all of the same mitigating evidence that was presented at the Goodman sentencing hearing. However, defendant\u2019s mother, sister, and neighbor did not testify at this sentencing hearing.</p> <p id=\"b158-7\" pgmap=\"158\">Defendant claims that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to investigate and present evidence regarding defendant\u2019s involvement in a cult. According to defendant, this evidence showed that defendant\u2019s involvement in a cult was \u201cso extreme that it was labeled by numerous mental health professionals, years before the murders, as evidencing delusional thought processes and psychotic behavior.\u201d Defendant argues that this evidence would have helped to explain to the jurors \u201chow he was associated with these murders (and how others were more culpable) and how he came to be able to be involved in such acts.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b158-8\" pgmap=\"158(38) 159(81)\">Defendant attached to his post-conviction petition a 1981 psychiatric summary report from the Psychiatric Institute of Cook County regarding defendant\u2019s fitness for trial of the pending burglary charge against him. The psychiatrist who examined defendant concluded that defendant was fit for trial, stating that defendant \u201cdoes not display any psychotic behavior nor show any psychotic symptoms.\u201d The psychiatrist reported that defendant \u201crelates an interest in the occult [and] talks about getting together with other young men to have some sort of seances involving \u2018black magic.\u2019 \u201d Defendant insisted that \u201cbeing sent to jail is not right and he needs to be in a hospital for his \u2018problem.\u2019 \u201d According to the psychiatrist, defendant appeared \u201cquite manipulative.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b159-5\" pgmap=\"159\">Defendant also attached a 1981 psychological examination from the Psychiatric Institute which recounts defendant\u2019s statements that he has \u201cgone pretty far into the occult\u201d and that he saw devils in inkblots. Defendant next referenced a psychological summary that was conducted by a psychologist who concluded that defendant was not fit for trial on his pending burglary case. Defendant reported to the psychologist that he was experiencing hallucinations and paranoid delusions, and expressed concern about his involvement in witchcraft. Specifically, defendant stated that he was engrossed in the study of black magic, and that he and several friends, led by a 24-year-old warlock, held services, conjured demons, and cast spells. The psychologist concluded that, although defendant\u2019s request for psychiatric treatment seemed genuine, defendant \u201cis shrewd enough to seek treatment as a possible alternative to incarceration.\u201d</p> <p id=\"AO\" pgmap=\"159(89) 160(48)\">Defendant also provided a May 17, 1987, report from the Olympia Fields police department. The report states that Feinberg told police officers that \u201cthere are people who believe that Mr. Patrick Page is the anti-Christ, and that Page derived a power from the location where Chuck Howell\u2019s body was buried.\u201d The report further recounts that Feinberg \u201cindicated that Patrick Page was the leader of a Satanic cult.\u201d Another report from the Olympia Fields police department describes a call that the reporting officer received from Marty Carson, who identified himself as a friend of defendant. Carson stated that he had accompanied defendant to a campfire site where defendant would \u201cparty,\u201d and from where defendant stated he derived a \u201cspecial power.\u201d Defendant further provided some unattributed notes regarding defendant\u2019s involvement in black magic, rituals, and sacrifices.</p> <p id=\"b160-5\" pgmap=\"160\">Defendant attached his own affidavit, which states that \u201cI was involved in certain practices from a young age, and am still in fear of individuals who were involved and may still be involved in these practices.\u201d Defendant likewise attached affidavits from his father and brother. These affidavits relate that, when defendant was 16 years old, he was involved in \u201csome kind of cult or devil worship.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b160-6\" pgmap=\"160\">Finally, defendant provided reports from a physician and a psychologist regarding the workings of cults. These doctors essentially reviewed the information we have just discussed and postulated that defendant was under the influence of a cult leader at the time he committed the murders at issue. These doctors also generally described the mind-control techniques used by leaders of cults.</p> <p id=\"b160-7\" pgmap=\"160(128) 161(39)\">After reviewing this allegedly mitigating evidence, we hold that there is no reasonable probability that, had counsel presented this evidence at the sentencing hearings, the juries would have concluded that the mitigating factors were sufficient to preclude the death sentence. See Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 695, 80 L. Ed. 2d 674, 698, 104 S. Ct. 2052, 2069 (1984). Contrary to defendant\u2019s argument, the jurors likely would have viewed this evidence of cult involvement as aggravating evidence. This evidence describes defendant\u2019s involvement in devil worship and ritualistic sacrifices. Even worse, some of this evidence shows that defendant was the leader of the cult engaged in these practices. Significantly, the evidence also shows that the doctors to whom defendant mentioned his cult involvement suggested that defendant was manipulative and might be trying to avoid prison by relying on his cult involvement. In any event, defendant fails to explain how any of this evidence showed a \u201ccult connection to the murders\u201d of Howell and Goodman.</p> <p id=\"b161-5\" pgmap=\"161\">Furthermore, the aggravating evidence in this case far outweighs the mitigating evidence. The State presented defendant\u2019s confession to the murders of Devine, Howell, and Goodman. Defendant, Feinberg, and Kenneth Cheney murdered Devine because Devine \u201cripped off\u2019 Cheney in a drug deal. They tied up Devine with an extension cord and transported him to a wooded area, where they stabbed him to death. After the murder, defendant, Cheney, and Feinberg drove to Cheney\u2019s home, where they drank alcohol and smoked marijuana.</p> <p id=\"b161-6\" pgmap=\"161\">Defendant and Feinberg later murdered Howell because they were worried that Devine\u2019s disappearance would make Howell suspicious. Defendant and Feinberg planned the murder in advance. They drew a map of the area where they would bury Howell, went to the planned burial site and dug a hole, and lured Howell to the site under the pretense of having a party there. Defendant stabbed Howell, and Feinberg hit him over the head with a large stick. They buried Howell and set his grave on fire. After the murder, defendant and Feinberg went to defendant\u2019s house, smoked marijuana, and drove around in Howell\u2019s car.</p> <p id=\"b161-7\" pgmap=\"161(83) 162(16)\">A year and a half later, defendant originated the plan to murder Goodman because defendant held a grudge against Goodman. Defendant stabbed Goodman in the chest four times. Defendant and Feinberg stole credit cards and cash from Goodman\u2019s wallet before wrapping Goodman\u2019s body in a sheet and a rug and placing it in the trunk of Goodman\u2019s car. After stopping at a tavern in southeastern Wisconsin to eat and play pool, defendant and Feinberg drove to a rural area in Wisconsin, dug a hole, and buried Goodman\u2019s body. They then burned the sheet and the rug over the grave.</p> <p id=\"b162-3\" pgmap=\"162\">The State also presented details of defendant\u2019s criminal history. The State introduced certified copies of defendant\u2019s conviction following a guilty plea on May 11, 1982, to seven charges of burglary. Defendant was sentenced to five years\u2019 imprisonment for the offenses. After defendant had served a portion of this prison sentence, he was assigned to a prerelease center. Residents were allowed to leave the center during the day to work, but were required to return each night. A supervisor from the center testified that defendant signed out on the morning of December 5, 1983, and did not come back until January 2, 1984. Defendant said that he did not return on December 5 because he had gotten drunk and fallen asleep. Because defendant knew that he was on escape status anyway, he decided to stay out for the holidays. Consequently, defendant was returned to the custody of the Illinois Department of Corrections.</p> <p id=\"b162-4\" pgmap=\"162\">A casework supervisor from the Logan Correctional Center testified that defendant was incarcerated at Logan beginning in September 1982, and remained there until May 1983, when he was assigned to the prerelease center. Defendant was returned to Logan in February 1984, and was released on parole two months later. Defendant received 27 disciplinary tickets while an inmate at Logan. Defendant received these tickets for physical or verbal altercations with other inmates, insulting behavior toward the staff, possession of contraband, and failing to go to school.</p> <p id=\"b162-5\" pgmap=\"162(48) 163(16)\">Captain Robert Maeyama of the Park Forest police department also testified regarding various contacts he had with defendant while defendant was a juvenile. Captain Maeyama stated that he apprehended defendant in connection with several different charges during a period from June 1977 to October 1980. These charges included three batteries or aggravated batteries, two burglaries, a theft, a car theft, and disorderly conduct.</p> <p id=\"b163-5\" pgmap=\"163\">A review of this aggravating evidence shows that defendant is a domineering and remorseless murderer. Given defendant\u2019s extensive criminal history, as well as the heinous nature of the crimes in this case, defendant has failed to establish the requisite prejudice under Strickland. There is no reasonable probability that the outcome of defendant\u2019s sentencing hearings would have been different had the alleged mitigating evidence at issue been presented.</p> <p id=\"b163-6\" pgmap=\"163\">As a final matter, defendant requests this court to order a limited remand so that he may have a complete neurological examination conducted. Defendant initially filed a motion for funds so that defendant could retain a neurological expert to perform \u201cfull neurological testing\u201d of defendant. Defendant argued that the limited evaluation conducted by Dr. Girdaukas showed possible brain damage or neurological disorders. Defendant sought funds to retain an expert to conduct this testing. The trial court denied defendant\u2019s motion. In accordance with our preceding discussion, we hold that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying this motion.</p> <p id=\"b163-7\" pgmap=\"163\">Defendant, in his reply brief in this court, states that the Capital Litigation Division now has sufficient funds to pay for the requested neurological testing. Defendant, therefore, requests a limited remand \u201cfor the purpose of conducting the Neurological Assessment and the Cult-related Psycho-Social investigation.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b163-8\" pgmap=\"163(57) 164(24)\">We decline to order a limited remand in this case. Defendant presented the testimony of Dr. Girdaukas, a licensed clinical psychologist, at both sentencing hearings. Dr. Girdaukas administered numerous psychological tests to defendant and presented his findings to the jurors. There is no reasonable probability that the outcome of defendant\u2019s sentencing hearings would have been different had evidence of defendant\u2019s cult involvement been presented. We therefore decline to remand this case for the testing defendant now seeks.</p> <p id=\"b164-5\" pgmap=\"164\">D. Failure to Challenge Proportionality of Defendant\u2019s Sentence</p> <p id=\"b164-6\" pgmap=\"164\">Defendant argues that appellate counsel was ineffective for failing to challenge the proportionality of defendant\u2019s death sentences to the natural life sentences of his codefendant, Feinberg. On direct appeal in the Howell case, appellate counsel argued that the trial court improperly precluded defendant from presenting to the jury, at the second stage of the sentencing hearing, nonstatutory mitigation evidence that his codefendant, Gerald Feinberg, had pled guilty and was sentenced to natural life imprisonment for the murder of Howell. See People v. Page, 156 Ill. 2d 258, 270 (1993). We noted that defendant was not requesting \u201cthat this court undertake a review of the proportionality of his sentence,\u201d Page, 156 Ill. 2d at 271. Rather, defendant was arguing \u201cthat his codefendant\u2019s sentence and relative degree of participation in the murder should have been considered by the jury at the second stage of his sentencing hearing.\u201d Page, 156 Ill. 2d at 271. We rejected this argument and held that defendant\u2019s request to have the jury consider evidence of a codefendant\u2019s sentence is neither constitutionally required nor relevant to the jury\u2019s examination of the individual defendant\u2019s characteristics and the circumstances of his offense. Page, 156 Ill. 2d at 270-72.</p> <p id=\"b164-7\" pgmap=\"164\">Defendant now contends that appellate counsel in the Howell case should have instead argued that defendant\u2019s death sentence is disproportionate to the natural life sentence of his codefendant Feinberg. Defendant also suggests that appellate counsel in the Goodman case was likewise ineffective for failing to challenge the proportionality of defendant\u2019s death sentence to the natural life sentence of Feinberg.</p> <p id=\"b165-4\" pgmap=\"165\">Comparative proportionality review in death penalty cases is not required by either the United States Constitution (see Pulley v. Harris, 465 U.S. 37, 79 L. Ed. 2d 29, 104 S. Ct. 871 (1984)) or the Illinois death penalty statute (see People v. Palmer, 162 Ill. 2d 465, 491 (1994)). This court has, however, considered whether a sentence of death in a particular case is disproportionately harsh in comparison with a less severe sanction imposed on a codefendant convicted of the same crime. See, e.g., People v. Burt, 168 Ill. 2d 49, 80-81 (1995); People v. Flores, 153 Ill. 2d 264, 294-96 (1992); People v. St. Pierre, 146 Ill. 2d 494, 513 (1992); People v. Bean, 137 Ill. 2d 65, 134 (1990). Such judicial review acknowledges the necessity to avoid arbitrary or capricious death sentences by insuring that the cases in which death is imposed are rationally distinguished from those in which it is not imposed. St. Pierre, 146 Ill. 2d at 513. The focus of this review is on the particular defendant\u2019s involvement in the crime, the nature of the crime, the character and background of the defendant, including any criminal record, and the defendant\u2019s potential for rehabilitation. See Burt, 168 Ill. 2d at 80; Flores, 153 Ill. 2d at 294.</p> <p id=\"b165-5\" pgmap=\"165\">The record reveals the following relevant information regarding defendant\u2019s involvement in the crimes. In the Goodman case, it was defendant who originated the plan to rob and kill Goodman because defendant held a grudge against Goodman. Defendant stabbed Goodman in the chest four times; Feinberg did not inflict any injuries on Goodman. In the Howell case, defendant stabbed Howell in the chest, and Feinberg hit Howell in the head with a stick.</p> <p id=\"b165-6\" pgmap=\"165(39) 166(90)\">Moreover, defendant had a substantial criminal history while Feinberg had no criminal convictions. Details of defendant\u2019s criminal history were introduced at the sentencing hearings in the Goodman and Howell cases. As we have previously discussed, this criminal history includes defendant\u2019s conviction for burglary, and his escape from the prerelease center where he was serving a portion of his sentence for this conviction. Additionally, defendant received 27 disciplinary tickets while an inmate at Logan Correctional Center. These disciplinary tickets were for physical or verbal altercations with other inmates, insulting behavior toward the staff, possession of contraband, and failing to go to school. Furthermore, defendant was charged with numerous offenses while a juvenile, including three batteries or aggravated batteries, two burglaries, a theft, a car theft, and disorderly conduct.</p> <p id=\"b166-5\" pgmap=\"166\">Given defendant\u2019s role as the leader in the crimes in this case, defendant\u2019s criminal background, and defendant\u2019s lack of potential for rehabilitation, defendant\u2019s death sentences were not disproportionate to Feinberg\u2019s natural life imprisonment sentences. Defendant, therefore, has failed to make a substantial showing that he received ineffective assistance of appellate counsel in this regard.</p> <p id=\"b166-6\" pgmap=\"166\">II. Perjured Testimony</p> <p id=\"b166-7\" pgmap=\"166\">Defendant next argues that his constitutional right to due process was violated at trial because the State failed to correct false testimony.</p> <p id=\"b166-8\" pgmap=\"166\">The State\u2019s knowing use of perjured testimony to obtain a criminal conviction constitutes a violation of due process of law. People v. Jimerson, 166 Ill. 2d 211, 223 (1995). A conviction obtained by the knowing use of perjured testimony must be set aside if there is any reasonable likelihood that the false testimony could have affected the jury\u2019s verdict. People v. Olinger, 176 Ill. 2d 326, 345 (1997), citing United States v. Bagley, 473 U.S. 667, 678-80, 87 L. Ed. 2d 481, 492, 105 S. Ct. 3375, 3381-82 (1985).</p> <p id=\"b166-9\" pgmap=\"166(18) 167(65)\">These principles likewise apply where the State, although not soliciting the false testimony, allows it to go uncorrected. Olinger, 176 Ill. 2d at 345, citing Napue v. Illinois, 360 U.S. 264, 269, 3 L. Ed. 2d 1217, 1221, 79 S. Ct. 1173, 1177 (1959). This is so even where the witness\u2019 false testimony goes only to that witness\u2019 credibility. Olinger, 176 Ill. 2d at 345, citing Napue, 360 U.S. at 269, 3 L. Ed. 2d at 1221, 79 S. Ct. at 1177.</p> <p id=\"b167-5\" pgmap=\"167\">Defendant\u2019s claim revolves around the testimony of Glen Rogers and Greg Wilson, who testified at the Goodman murder trial. Glen Rogers and Greg Wilson testified that on Monday, May 11, 1987, they went to Goodman\u2019s house and looked in the windows. They noticed that a television set and stereo equipment were missing. They then called the Olympia Fields police department. Goodman had been murdered the preceding Thursday.</p> <p id=\"b167-6\" pgmap=\"167\">Defendant references the cross-examination of these witnesses. Rogers denied that he had sexual relations with Feinberg at Goodman\u2019s house, and also denied that he had any sexual relations with Feinberg other than one time at his own house. Wilson denied that there was any relationship involving cocaine or homosexual conduct between himself and Goodman.</p> <p id=\"b167-7\" pgmap=\"167\">Defendant now argues that the testimony by Rogers and Wilson was false, and that the State should have corrected the testimony. In support of this claim, he attaches a May 14, 1987, report from the Olympia Fields police department. This report describes the reporting officer\u2019s meeting with Rogers. Rogers stated that he had two or three sexual encounters with Feinberg during the past two months and three or four sexual encounters with Feinberg during the past year. Defendant also attaches a page of a May 17, 1987, Olympia Fields police department report which recounts that Wilson told the officer that Feinberg had just called Wilson and asked to speak to Rogers, who lived with Wilson. Feinberg wanted to know if Rogers had any cocaine.</p> <p id=\"b167-8\" pgmap=\"167(7) 168(103)\">Defendant argues that this alleged \u201chomosexual and drug-related conduct went directly to the heart of the [voluntary] manslaughter defense, and it also served to impeach the State\u2019s witnesses.\u201d As we have discussed, defendant\u2019s theory of defense at the Goodman trial, was that he killed Goodman while acting under a sudden and intense passion resulting from serious provocation, and therefore committed voluntary manslaughter. The alleged provocation is that Goodman made a sexual advance toward him. The number of sexual encounters between Rogers and Feinberg, and their involvement in possessing or using cocaine, is not relevant to defendant\u2019s establishing a voluntary manslaughter defense based on Goodman\u2019s alleged sexual overture to defendant.</p> <p id=\"b168-5\" pgmap=\"168\">Furthermore, even if Rogers and Wilson had been impeached at trial with the evidence defendant cites, there is no reasonable likelihood that their testimony could have affected the jury\u2019s verdict. The testimony of Rogers and Wilson played a minor role in the State\u2019s case, and, as this court stated on direct appeal in the Goodman case, the evidence of defendant\u2019s guilt was overwhelming. See People v. Page, 155 Ill. 2d 232, 262 (1993). In particular, defendant confessed in detail to the crime, and an eyewitness saw defendant at Goodman\u2019s house shortly before Goodman disappeared. Thus, defendant has failed to make a substantial showing of a constitutional violation in this regard.</p> <p id=\"b168-6\" pgmap=\"168\">III. Brady Violation</p> <p id=\"b168-7\" pgmap=\"168\">Defendant also contends that the State violated his right to due process by failing to disclose to the defense all exculpatory evidence as required by Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83, 10 L. Ed. 2d 215, 83 S. Ct. 1194 (1963). Defendant argues that the State violated the Brady rule by failing to disclose evidence regarding the victim Goodman\u2019s past homosexual conduct and evidence regarding defendant\u2019s involvement in cult activities.</p> <p id=\"b168-8\" pgmap=\"168(8) 169(203)\">To establish a Brady violation, the suppressed evidence must be both favorable to the accused and material. Favorable evidence is material in this context \u201c \u2018only if there is a reasonable probability that, had the evidence been disclosed to the defense, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u2019 \u201d People v. Hobley, 182 Ill. 2d 404, 432-33 (1998), quoting United States v. Bagley, 473 U.S. 667, 682, 87 L. Ed. 2d 481, 494, 105 S. Ct. 3375, 3383 (1985). A \u201c \u2018reasonable probability\u2019 \u201d of a different result is a \u201c \u2018probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.\u2019 \u201d Hobley, 182 Ill. 2d at 433, quoting Bagley, 473 U.S. at 682, 87 L. Ed. 2d at 494, 105 S. Ct. at 3383. To determine whether evidence is material, a court must consider the cumulative effect of all suppressed evidence favorable to the defense. Hobley, 182 Ill. 2d at 433, 435. Furthermore, the prosecution cannot escape its duty under Brady by contending that the suppressed evidence was known only to police investigators and not to the prosecutors. Hobley, 182 Ill. 2d at 433, citing Kyles v. Whitley, 514 U.S. 419, 438, 131 L. Ed. 2d 490, 508-09, 115 S. Ct. 1555, 1568 (1995).</p> <p id=\"b169-5\" pgmap=\"169\">The allegedly suppressed evidence to which defendant refers is the evidence of defendant\u2019s involvement in a cult, which we previously discussed in addressing defendant\u2019s claim that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to present mitigating evidence. Defendant also references allegedly suppressed evidence of Goodman\u2019s \u201chomosexual conduct and contacts with the defendants.\u201d This is the evidence that we previously discussed in addressing defendant\u2019s claims that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to present sufficient evidence of a voluntary manslaughter defense, and that the State failed to correct perjured testimony.</p> <p id=\"b169-6\" pgmap=\"169(34) 170(45)\">Defendant has failed to offer any argument as to how there is a reasonable probability that this allegedly suppressed evidence would have changed the result of the proceedings. Moreover, our resolution of defendant\u2019s other arguments which reference the allegedly suppressed evidence demonstrates that there is no reasonable probability that this evidence would have changed the result of the proceedings. We therefore hold that defendant has failed to make a substantial showing of a Brady violation.</p> <p id=\"b170-5\" pgmap=\"170\">We also note that defendant offers no basis upon which to conclude that his trial counsel did not in fact possess these police reports. In this regard, however, defendant argues that the post-conviction trial court abused its discretion in denying his motion to depose trial counsel. We hold that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying defendant\u2019s motion to depose his trial counsel. Because this allegedly suppressed evidence is not material within the meaning of Brady, there is no need to inquire of defense counsel whether they possessed it.</p> <p id=\"b170-6\" pgmap=\"170\">IV Death Penalty Instructions</p> <p id=\"b170-7\" pgmap=\"170\">Defendant argues that the instructions given to the jury at his sentencing hearings are confusing, misleading, and violate his constitutional rights. Defendant has waived this issue by failing to raise it on direct appeal. See People v. Towns, 182 Ill. 2d 491, 503 (1998). Defendant, however, argues that this argument is not waived because its evidentiary basis was de hors the trial record. See People v. Whitehead, 169 Ill. 2d 355, 372 (1996), overruled in part on other grounds, People v. Coleman, 183 Ill. 2d 366 (1998).</p> <p id=\"b170-8\" pgmap=\"170(66) 171(111)\">Defendant relies on the studies of Professor Hans Zeisel and Professor Shari Diamond in arguing that we should remand the cause for an evidentiary hearing on the fairness of the instructions. Both the Zeisel and Diamond studies purported to test the ability of potential jurors to comprehend certain Illinois death penalty instructions. The 1990 Zeisel study, which concluded that the instructions resulted in misunderstanding and confusion, formed the basis for a federal district court\u2019s holding that the death penalty instructions were constitutionally infirm. See United States ex rel. Free v. Peters, 806 F. Supp. 705 (N.D. Ill. 1992). The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, however, reversed the district court\u2019s holding. United States ex rel. Free v. Peters, 12 F.3d 700 (7th Cir. 1993); see also Gacy v. Wellborn, 994 F.2d 305 (7th Cir. 1993). This court has agreed that the Zeisel study does not establish that the Illinois death penalty instructions are unconstitutional. See People v. Jackson, 182 Ill. 2d 30, 93 (1998); People v. Brown, 172 Ill. 2d 1, 55-56 (1996).</p> <p id=\"b171-5\" pgmap=\"171\">Defendant, however, cites the study by Professor Diamond, which was conducted after the Zeisel study. The Diamond study was designed to address two primary objections to the Zeisel study: (1) that the Zeisel study did not use a control group to determine whether revised jury instructions would improve performance and (2) that the Zeisel study did not take into account jury deliberations. The results of the Diamond study confirmed the conclusion of the Zeisel study that the death penalty instructions were confusing.</p> <p id=\"b171-6\" pgmap=\"171\">This court has already rejected the argument that the Diamond study provides a basis for invalidating the Illinois death penalty instructions. See People v. Terrell, 185 Ill. 2d 467, 518-19 (1998); Jackson, 182 Ill. 2d at 93; People v. Hobley, 182 Ill. 2d 404, 467-70 (1998); Brown, 172 Ill. 2d at 55-57. Specifically, in Brown, we stated:</p> <blockquote id=\"ANl\" pgmap=\"171(84) 172(28)\">\u201c[A]lthough the Diamond study claims to correct two deficiencies in the Zeisel study, there still remain more generalized problems with the research. Perhaps the most fundamental objection is'the \u2018lack of comparability between the test setting and the sentencing hearing.\u2019 See Free, 12 F.3d at 705. There is no reason to suppose that actual jurors who have sat through trial and a sentencing hearing would respond to the sentencing instructions in the same way as the test subjects who simply listened to an audiotaped description of the evidence presented in the case and an audiotape of the instructions, as was done in the Diamond study.\u201d Brown, 172 Ill. 2d at 57.</blockquote> <p id=\"b172-5\" pgmap=\"172\">We adhere to our prior holdings and hold that an evidentiary hearing is not warranted on defendant\u2019s claim that the death penalty instructions are unconstitutional.</p> <p id=\"b172-6\" pgmap=\"172\">In this regard, defendant also argues that the post-conviction trial court abused its discretion in denying defendant\u2019s request for production of the juror cards for the 12 jurors who sat at the guilt and sentencing proceedings in the Goodman case. Defendant seeks to locate and interview the jurors so that he may \u201csupport the claim that the instructions used in the instant case were confusing or misled the jury.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b172-7\" pgmap=\"172\">This court in People v. Hobley, 182 Ill. 2d 404, 467-70 (1998), addressed a related issue. In Hobley, the defendant likewise argued that the death penalty instructions are unconstitutional. In addition to citing the Zeisel and Diamond studies, the defendant submitted affidavits from the jurors in his case. Some of the jurors stated that they found the instructions to be confusing; that they felt obligated to impose the death penalty as a result of their guilty verdict; and that they believed that the defendant could be released on parole if they did not impose the death penalty. Hobley, 182 Ill. 2d at 470. This court held that this information pertains to the method, motive, or process by which the jurors reached their verdict and therefore, may not be used to impeach the jury\u2019s verdict. Hobley, 182 Ill. 2d at 470.</p> <p id=\"b172-8\" pgmap=\"172\">Accordingly, the information defendant seeks pursuant to his motion for production of the juror cards may not be used to support his current argument. Thus, we hold that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying defendant\u2019s request for production of the juror cards.</p> <p id=\"b172-9\" pgmap=\"172\">CONCLUSION</p> <p id=\"b172-10\" pgmap=\"172(9) 173(108)\">For the reasons stated, the judgment of the circuit court of Cook County dismissing defendant\u2019s post-conviction petition without an evidentiary hearing is affirmed. We direct the clerk of this court to enter an order setting Tuesday, November 14, 2000, as the date on which the sentence of death, entered by the circuit court of Cook County, shall be carried out. Defendant shall be executed in the manner provided by law. 725 ILCS 5/119 \u2014 5 (West 1998). The clerk of this court shall send a certified copy of the mandate in this case to the Director of Corrections, the warden of Tamms Correctional Center, and the warden of the institution where defendant is confined.</p> <p id=\"b173-5\" pgmap=\"173\">Affirmed.</p> <footnote label=\"1\"> <p id=\"b143-7\" pgmap=\"143\">Effective July 1, 1987, the legislature amended section 9 \u2014 2 of the Criminal Code of 1961 and replaced the offense of voluntary manslaughter with the offense of second degree murder. See 720 ILCS 5/9 \u2014 2 (West 1998). The second degree murder statute incorporates the mitigating factors of sudden and intense passion and unreasonable belief in the need for self-defense. See People v. Tenner, 157 Ill. 2d 341, 371-72 (1993).</p> </footnote> </opinion> <opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\"> <author id=\"b173-6\" pgmap=\"173\">CHIEF JUSTICE HARRISON,</author> <p id=\"A5\" pgmap=\"173\">concurring in part and dissenting in part:</p> <p id=\"b173-7\" pgmap=\"173\">I agree that Page\u2019s convictions should not be disturbed. In my view, however, his sentence of death cannot be allowed to stand. For the reasons set forth in my partial concurrence and partial dissent in People v.
