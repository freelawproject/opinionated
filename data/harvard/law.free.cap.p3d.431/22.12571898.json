We reverse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   \u00b62 We restate the issue on appeal as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-10\">\n   <em>\n    Was Walter prejudiced by ineffective assistance of counsel?\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b63 On July 16, 2015, the State charged Brian Keith Walter with Criminal Possession of Dangerous drugs, a felony, in violation of \u00a7 45-9-102(6), MCA (2015); Criminal Possession of Drug Paraphernalia, a misdemeanor, in violation of \u00a7 45-10-103, MCA ; and Obstructing a Peace Officer, a misdemeanor, in violation of \u00a7 45-7-302, MCA. Walter eventually\n   pleaded guilty to all three charges without entering into a plea agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b64 The State sought to have Walter sentenced as a Persistent Felony Offender (\"PFO\") pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 46-18-501 and -502, MCA (2015), which include mandatory minimum sentencing guidelines.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defense\n   counsel argued in a sentencing memorandum that the PFO statutes were inapplicable because a more specific statute, \u00a7 45-9-102(7), MCA (2015), controlled over the general PFO statutes. Section 45-9-102(7), MCA (2015), presumes that a first-time drug offender is entitled to a deferred sentence. Accordingly, defense counsel recommended imposition of a deferred sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b65 The State argued that the mandatory minimum PFO sentence was compulsory because the prerequisites had been met and, in the State's view, the only available exception to the PFO sentence, \u00a7 46-18-222, MCA, was inapplicable. The State asserted that Walter \"must be incarcerated for at least five years\" pursuant to the PFO statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b66 The District Court heard argument as to whether the PFO sentence was mandatory for Walter, or whether there was legal authority allowing for sentencing discretion. The District Court considered the question to be a \"novel legal issue\" and noted:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   I do not think that there is a Montana Supreme Court case on point in this situation. Typically, someone on a first offense drug possession charge is entitled to a deferred imposition of sentence; in this scenario, the Defendant had a prior felony, and the State has filed a PFO designation in this case. The two statutes are certainly in conflict. They are distinguishable from the DUI statutes which specifically prohibit a deferred sentence on a DUI, however, I understand the analysis that both of you have used in\n   <em>\n    Damon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and the State in the other two cited cases.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b67 The District Court continued: \"I think legally that with a PFO designation, I'm required to follow the PFO statute. ... What is really interesting in this case is that the PSI [presentence investigation report] writer recommends a DOC [Department of Corrections] sentence which the PFO statute doesn't allow me to give you.\" Defense counsel interjected that the District Court may be able to impose a DOC sentence, \"I think you can, Your Honor, at least consider it because we've done it.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b68 The District Court paused the proceedings to consult the PFO statute then concluded:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   Mr. Walter, this is the law, and I'm required to follow the law as it's written at this time. That doesn't mean that I don't wish you the best, and that I hope in the screening process as you get into the prison, I certainly hope that you can be placed in a treatment program immediately. I hope that they don't make you serve the amount of time that they typically do before those kind of programs become available to you because what you need is treatment, and you have demonstrated in the past that after you've had treatment and when you are in a structured program that you do well.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b69 The District Court then sentenced Walter to five years in the Montana State Prison for Criminal Possession of Dangerous Drugs, in accordance with the PFO statute's mandatory minimum sentence, imposed two six-month sentences to run concurrently for the other two charges, and fined Walter $1,000.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b610 Claims of ineffective assistance of counsel are mixed questions of law and fact which this Court reviews de novo.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <em>\n    St. Germain v.

Walter's counsel failed to cite both the Alternative Sentencing Authority statute (\"ASA statute\"), \u00a7 45-9-202, MCA, and\n   <em>\n    Brendal\n   </em>\n   , a pivotal opinion interpreting the interrelationship between the ASA and PFO statutes. In\n   <em>\n    Brendal\n   </em>\n   , this Court held that even if the State pursues PFO sentencing, and the defendant meets the PFO designation, the District Court maintains the authority to sentence under the ASA statute if it finds that incarceration is inappropriate.\n   <em>\n    Brendal\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 31. Here, the District Court proceeded to sentencing uninformed of these fundamental authorities, evidenced by the District Court's beliefs that there was no \"Montana Supreme Court case on point in this situation\" and that the issue presented was \"novel.\" Defense counsel's oversight typifies the unreasonable performance discussed in\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Hinton\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b616 Walter established that there is a reasonable probability that, but for his counsel's errors, he would have received a deferred or reduced sentence. The record reflects that the District Court wanted to avoid sentencing under the PFO statutes and sought to prioritize treatment for Walter over incarceration. The District Court was also perplexed by the PSI recommendation for a DOC placement when the PFO statutes only allowed for a state prison sentence. The District Court briefly recessed to research whether it had discretion to bypass the PFO five-year mandatory minimum sentence. Mistakenly, the District Court believed that application of the PFO statute was mandatory and ruminated: \"At this point I can't help but say it is time for some changes in the statutes. I hope that the Justice Reassessment\n   Project will take a look at this as far as drug offenses go and come up with\n   something that perhaps is different.\" Had Walter's counsel brought the ASA statute and\n   <em>\n    Brendal\n   </em>\n   to the District Court's attention, there is reasonable probability that Walter would have received a different sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b617 We do not need to address Walter's argument that the District Court improperly imposed multiple information technology user surcharges because the State concedes that the fees were incorrectly calculated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b618 For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that Walter's attorney provided ineffective assistance of counsel by failing to cite \u00a7 45-9-202, MCA, and\n   <em>\n    Brendal\n   </em>\n   , and that Walter was prejudiced as a result.
