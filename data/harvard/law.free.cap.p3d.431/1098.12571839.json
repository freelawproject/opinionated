DRATH, Appellant.\n </parties>\n <docketnumber id=\"p-2\">\n  No. 49403-5-II\n </docketnumber>\n <court id=\"p-3\">\n  Court of Appeals of Washington, Division 2.\n </court>\n <decisiondate id=\"p-4\">\n  December 27, 2018\n </decisiondate>\n <p id=\"p-5\">\n  PART PUBLISHED OPINION\n </p>\n <opinion type=\"majority\">\n  <author id=\"p-6\">\n   Lee, J.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   \u00b61 Orlena R. Drath appeals her convictions for residential burglary, first degree burglary, first degree theft, theft of a firearm, first degree unlawful possession of a firearm, first degree trafficking in stolen property, and bail jumping, and the resulting sentence of 128 months of confinement. She argues that defense counsel provided ineffective assistance during the plea negotiation process by misinforming her of the potential sentencing range she faced if found guilty on all charges at trial. Drath also argues that defense counsel provided ineffective assistance by failing to object to a statement the prosecutor made\n   during closing argument. Finally, Drath contends that the trial court violated her constitutional right to present a defense by limiting her cross-examination of an adversarial witness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   \u00b62 In the published portion of this opinion, we hold that defense counsel's failure to provide Drath with her correct sentencing range prejudiced Drath and, thus, amounted to ineffective assistance of counsel. In the unpublished portion of this opinion, we hold that defense counsel was not ineffective for failing to object to a statement the prosecutor made during closing argument and that the trial court did not violate her constitutional right to present a defense by limiting her cross-examination of an adversarial witness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   \u00b63 Accordingly, we reverse and remand to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   FACTS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   A. JUDGEMENT AND SENTENCE\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b64 Between March and April 2011, Drath and her then boyfriend, Scott Herigstad, repeatedly broke into their neighbors' home and took approximately 75 firearms and an unspecified number of knives and swords. The couple then sold some of the stolen guns and knives.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b65 The State charged Drath with residential burglary, first degree burglary, first degree theft, theft of a firearm, first degree unlawful possession of a firearm, second degree unlawful possession of a firearm, first degree trafficking in stolen property, and bail jumping for her involvement in the burglaries. A jury found Drath guilty as charged, and she was sentenced to serve a total of 128 months in confinement. Pursuant to RCW 9.94A.589(1)(c),\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   the sentencing court ordered Drath's sentences for first degree unlawful possession of a firearm and theft of a firearm to run consecutively.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   B. MOTION FOR A NEW TRIAL\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b66 Drath filed a pro se motion for a new trial. In her motion, Drath alleged that she was \"drastically misinformed about possible sentencing ranges if [she] went to trial.\" Clerk's Papers (CP) at 103 (capitalization omitted). Drath had a worksheet given to her by counsel in which her counsel wrote that if found guilty on all eight charges, Drath would face a sentencing range between 87 and 116 months. The information written on the worksheet failed to show that under RCW 9.94A.589(1)(c), a sentence for theft of a firearm and first degree unlawful possession of a firearm would run consecutively. Had the worksheet applied RCW 9.94A.589(1)(c), Drath's sentencing range would have been between 103 and 136 months.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b67 Drath was appointed new counsel, who requested an evidentiary hearing concerning Drath's ineffective assistance of counsel claim. At the hearing, the State called the five attorneys who had represented Drath over the course of her case to testify.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   1. R. Sergi\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b68 As the first attorney assigned to Drath's case, Sergi represented Drath between April 2011 and October 2013. Sergi testified that in the course of his practice, he would ordinarily talk to clients about consecutive sentencing ranges. However, Sergi acknowledged that Drath's case was not \"necessarily normal\" because he had anticipated it would be transferred to the federal government. 10 Report of Proceedings (RP) (July 15, 2016) at 1440. And given the time that had passed, Sergi could not remember whether he had ever discussed Drath's sentencing\n   range with her. He also could not recall whether he had ever discussed a plea offer with Drath.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   2. S. Taschner\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b69 Taschner represented Drath between October 7, 2013, and June 2, 2014. Taschner discussed the possibility of a plea deal with Drath at a May 2014 meeting. According to Taschner, Drath became upset at the suggestion of a plea. Because Drath was upset at the meeting, Taschner never \"specifically mentioned what the bottom and top of the ranges would be on the sentence.\" 10 RP (July 15, 2016) at 1454. He planned to talk about the specific ranges at his next scheduled meeting with Drath, but Drath did not show up to that appointment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b610 During his representation of Drath, Taschner informed her that the sentences for theft of a firearm and either first or second degree unlawful possession of a firearm would run consecutively. However, Taschner brought up consecutive sentencing in the context of discussing additional charges the State could file against Drath. Taschner testified that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   In other words, I guess what I'm saying is that yes, we did discuss that some of these counts would run consecutive to one another, but that discussion also, I think, occurred in the context of trying to give her an appreciation that even more counts could be added that would also run consecutive with one another.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   10 RP (July 15, 2016) at 1456.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b611 Taschner never discussed specific sentencing ranges with Drath. Instead, he advised her that if the State were to file additional charges in her case, Drath could face more than 15 years in confinement. As to whether Drath was ever willing to consider a plea offer, Taschner testified, \"I don't recall [Drath] coming out and saying that there was - that no matter what she was going to trial. That wasn't stated.\" 10 RP (July 15, 2016) at 1458.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   3. P. Jones\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b612 Jones represented Drath between June 2, 2014, and January 27, 2015. When asked what discussions Jones had with Drath regarding consecutive sentencing in her case, Jones testified:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   I can't recall every discussion specifically, although this was a year and a half ago. With that said-two years ago, really. That said, there were a number of occasions on which we had that discussion, on which we compared the offers, as I received it from [the State], to the potential of time she could otherwise do. I mentioned the story earlier about the gentleman in Stevens County who got a hundred and twenty-five years, and I had specifically related that story to her as an example of what a consecutive sentence could do as opposed to a normal one.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   10 RP (July 15, 2016) at 1468.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b613 Nonetheless, Jones could not recall telling Drath that if convicted, she faced a sentencing range between 103 and 136 months. Jones never presented Drath with this specific number because he did not believe it truly represented the high end of sentencing Drath faced since the State could have filed additional firearm charges. Therefore, while Jones discussed the reality of consecutive sentencing for the firearm charges, this was in the context of Jones informing Drath that the State could file even more firearm charges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b614 Jones and the State negotiated a plea offer sometime before November 2014, which would have resulted in an agreed 41.5 month sentence. Drath, however, did not accept the offer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   4. J. Gazori\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b615 Gazori represented Drath between February 4, 2015, and September 1, 2015. Gazori represented Drath during her first trial in August 2015, which ended in a mistrial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b616 On June 2, 2015, Gazori met with the State to discuss the charges, Drath's offender score, and a plea offer. The State provided Gazori with a handwritten chart outlining the sentencing range Drath faced if convicted as charged. This chart showed that two of the counts were mandatorily consecutive and accurately identified the sentencing range as\n   charged between 103 and 136 months. This chart also showed a column labeled as a June 2 offer in which the State wrote out a range for four of the charges and then circled the range of 67 to 75 months. The State's June 2 offer was for Drath to plead guilty to theft of a firearm, first degree unlawful possession of a firearm, first degree trafficking in stolen property, and bail jumping.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b617 Gazori conveyed this offer to Drath. However, instead of using the word consecutive, he informed her that certain sentences would \"run after this.\" 10 RP (July 15, 2016) at 1491. The record does not show that Gazori ever showed or provided Drath a copy of the State's handwritten chart, which outlined her sentencing range if convicted at trial compared to the State's June 2 offer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b618 According to Gazori, he and the State subsequently discussed the plea offer before court one morning, without Drath present. During that discussion, the State did not write down the names of the charges, but it wrote down their count numbers. The State then drew a line to another set of counts to indicate which counts would run concurrent with one another. Gazori reviewed this handwritten document with Drath. However, Gazori never made a copy of the document, could not recall passing it on when he transferred the file, and had no idea what happened to that document. Drath rejected the plea offers Gazori presented to her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b619 On the day Drath's case ended in mistrial, the State offered to settle the case on the same plea terms that Herigstad had accepted, which resulted in 33 months of confinement. Gazori conveyed this offer to Drath, who asked for time to think it over and to discuss the offer with her family. Gazori asked the State if it would keep the offer open for one day, which the State declined to do. The State withdrew the offer before Drath responded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b620 When asked whether Gazori ever specifically informed Drath of the potential sentencing range she faced if convicted, he responded:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   I can't say with certainty that I did that. I - my recollection is I paraphrased it in that the one-oh-three to a hundred and thirty-six, if we just round that off roughly to the midrange is a hundred and twenty, so that's ten years, followed by-so what I did is I put it, I put it in more vague terms of years than specific numbers of months.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   10 RP (July 15, 2016) at 1505.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   5. F. Jardine\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b621 Jardine represented Drath from September 8, 2015, until April 5, 2016. Jardine negotiated plea offers with the State in January 2016, which culminated in the State reopening its previous June 2 offer with a sentencing range between 67 and 75 months. Drath did not accept this offer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \u00b622 As the trial date approached, Jardine and the State continued to discuss a possible plea resolution. Jardine proposed 40 months. The State counteroffered with 50 months.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00b623 When the State counteroffered with 50 months, Jardine asked, \"If we are looking at reaching an agreement for 50 [months] what crimes are you proposing - I will be meeting [with] Ms. Drath this week to review.\" Ex. at 17 (attachment 7). The State responded, \"Delete the Trafficking from the offer of 6.2.15.\" Ex. at 17 (attachment 7). Jardine agreed that the \"offer would have gotten to the fifty months by using two consecutive counts and an additional count.\" 10 RP (July 15, 2016) at 1522. Jardine did not identify which counts she referred to. She testified, \"and we had the math different because of the points being calculated different.\" 10 RP (July 15, 2016) at 1522-23. She did not explain what she meant by this statement. Drath rejected this 50-month offer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00b624 On cross-examination, Jardine identified a document in her handwriting with her office stamp dated January 11, 2016. Jardine testified that she typically writes this information on a yellow page, hands the yellow page to the client, and then keeps a copy in her file. This handwritten document listed the various charges Drath faced, along with the sentencing ranges in terms of months. The document stated the total sentencing range as charged was between 87 and 116 months, with \"12.4 [months] good time.\" Ex. at 18 (July 15, 2016).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   6. Orlena Drath\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   \u00b625 Drath testified that she only discussed possible sentencing consequences with some of her attorneys. Specifically, she discussed \"[a] little with Gazori,\" and Jones had relayed a narrative to her concerning one of his other clients. 10 RP (July 15, 2016) at 1542. Drath could not recall Gazori ever telling her the range of months she faced if she were found guilty on all charges at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   \u00b626 At Drath's first meeting with Jardine, they discussed a handwritten document outlining her potential sentence if convicted on all charges at trial. Drath identified the original handwritten document Jardine had provided, which stated a total sentencing range between 87 and 116 months. On a separate line in the document, Jardine wrote \"6 years.\" Ex. at 18. According to Drath, Jardine wrote this number to show the length of sentence she faced if convicted as charged. Jardine presented this number as Drath's worst case scenario.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   \u00b627 Drath also testified that she had discussed the 50-month offer with Jardine after Jardine had informed her of the erroneous sentence range. Specifically, Drath testified:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   Q. Okay. Were there discussions, later discussions about a resolution involving fifty months?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   A. When [Jardine] started the negotiations, she did bring up forty to [the prosecutor] and he came back with the fifty months, and then [Jardine] advised me that it really wasn't a deal, that I might as well take it to trial because [the prosecutor] wasn't trying to make any good offers.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   Q. But that offer of fifty months was communicated to you, correct?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   A. Yes, it was.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   Q. And you, after consultation with Ms. Jardine, did not take it, correct?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   A. No.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   Q. Okay.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   A. She advised it probably, it wasn't worth it to take it.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   10 RP (July 15, 2016) at 1547.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   \u00b628 When asked whether she would have considered the 50-month plea offer if she knew her true sentencing range, Drath testified, \"Yeah, I would have considered it.\" 10 RP (July 15, 2016) at 1548. When asked whether she would have accepted the offer, Drath responded, \"I'm not sure if I can answer that.\" 10 RP (July 15, 2016) at 1548.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   \u00b629 According to Drath, when she commenced trial with Jardine as counsel, Drath believed her sentence range if convicted was 87 to 116 months. In her conversations with her other four prior attorneys, Drath had never been told that her true sentencing range was 103 to 136 months.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   7. Trial Court's Ruling on Motion for New Trial\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   \u00b630 The trial court found that Jardine had failed to take into account the effect of RCW 9.94A.589(1)(c) when informing Drath of her sentencing range if convicted on all charges. The trial court also found that because Drath faced a maximum sentence of 136 months, Jardine's \"counsel to the defendant on January 11, 2016 was incorrect and contained a significant error.\" CP at 7. The trial court ruled that Jardine's representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness when she failed to properly advise Drath of the impact of RCW 9.94A.589(1)(c) on the charges filed against her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   \u00b631 However, the trial court also ruled that Drath had failed to show a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's deficient representation, the result would have been different. The trial court based its ruling on Drath's inability to testify that she would have accepted the State's final plea offer if she had known her correct sentencing range.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   \u00b632 The trial court denied Drath's motion for a new trial. Drath appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   \u00b633 Drath contends that she was provided ineffective assistance of counsel in the plea negotiation process when defense counsel misinformed her of the maximum sentencing range she faced if convicted. The State \"does not dispute Drath's allegation that her trial attorney erred,\" but argues that Drath fails to show resulting prejudice. Br. of Resp't at 2. We hold that defense counsel's failure to\n   provide Drath the correct sentencing range prejudiced Drath, and thus, amounted to ineffective assistance of counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   A.

Counsel misinformed Drath as to the sentencing range she faced if convicted at trial. As a result, Drath proceeded to trial with an understanding that if convicted of all charges, the maximum sentence she faced was 116 months when, in reality, she potentially faced 136 months. As in\n   <em>\n    Estes\n   </em>\n   , because her counsel misinformed her of the risk she faced, Drath was denied the ability to make an informed decision as to whether to accept the State's final 50-month plea offer.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=225%20P.3d%20956\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   \u00b642 The State distinguishes this case from\n   <em>\n    Estes\n   </em>\n   by arguing that Drath had rejected several pleas, whereas in\n   <em>\n    Estes\n   </em>\n   , the defendant refused to negotiate altogether. We find this distinction unpersuasive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   \u00b643 The State's argument assumes that a defendant's rejection of prior plea offers evidences unwillingness to engage in the plea bargaining process. But a defendant's perspective toward resolving his or her case through plea bargaining might very well change over the course of his or her case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   \u00b644 Here, the record shows that Drath rejected four plea offers in the five years her case was pending. But the record also shows that Drath considered the plea offers and actively discussed the offers with her various attorneys. Moreover, Drath testified that if she had known her true sentencing range when presented with the State's final 50-month plea offer, she \"would have considered it.\" 10 RP (July 15, 2016) at 1548. Thus, it is reasonably probable that had Drath known she faced a maximum sentence that was 20 months longer than her attorney advised, the result of the proceeding would have differed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   \u00b645 The State argues that Drath fails to show prejudice because \"it is doubtful that Drath did not know that she faced the potential of consecutive sentences\" when three of Drath's attorneys had informed her of the consecutive sentencing provision of RCW 9.94A.589(1)(c).

As to being informed of consecutive sentencing, even though three of Drath's attorneys testified that they had discussed the concept of consecutive sentencing, none of these attorneys provided Drath with a sentencing range taking RCW 9.94A.589(1)(c) into account.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   \u00b647 Taschner testified that he only discussed consecutive sentencing with Drath in the context of additional charges that the State could file. Instead of informing Drath of the sentencing range she faced on her current charges, Taschner advised Drath that if the State filed additional charges, she could face more than 15 years confinement. Jones never informed Drath of her actual sentencing range, but instead relayed a story of a different client in order to illustrate the gravity of consecutive sentencing. Gazori did tell Drath that some of her charges would \"run after this,\" but did not specifically show Drath how this would elevate her sentencing range from 87 to 116 months to 103 to 136 months. 10 RP (July 15, 2016) at 1491.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   \u00b648 Therefore, contrary to the State's argument, it is doubtful that Drath knew to add 16 to 20 months to her standard sentencing range based on the conversations she had with prior counsel on the concept of consecutive sentencing. The record shows that the only attorney who provided Drath with a concrete sentencing range based on Drath's specific charges was Jardine. But Jardine advised Drath, based on an erroneously calculated sentencing range, that the State's 50-month plea offer \"really wasn't a deal\" and that \"it wasn't worth it to take it.\" 10 RP (July 15, 2016) at 1547. Because the sentencing range Jardine provided was erroneous, Drath was not afforded the ability to make an informed decision whether to accept the State's final 50-month plea offer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   \u00b649 Finally, the State argues that Drath cannot show reasonable probability she would have accepted the State's final plea offer because when asked, she responded,\n   \" 'I'm not sure if I can answer that.' \" Br. of Resp't at 10 (quoting 10 RP (July 15, 2016) at 1548). The State is correct that the record does not show with complete certainty that Drath would have accepted the State's final plea offer had she known her correct sentencing range. \"But we need not be 100 percent sure that the outcome would have been different to find prejudice.\"\n   <em>\n    Estes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=188%20Wash.%202d%20450\">\n    188 Wash.2d at 466\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=395%20P.3d%201045\">\n    395 P.3d 1045\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Approximately two months later, the federal government took over the prosecution and the State's charges were dismissed without prejudice. In May 2013, the State filed a four count information after the federal government returned the case to the State. In February 2014, the State added additional charges.

During that time, the State made numerous plea offers. Drath rejected\n   all of them including ones for 33 months, 41.5 months, and 50 months. This latter offer, the one at issue in this case, came about after Drath made a plea offer of 40 months. The State rejected Drath's offer and counter offered with 50 months. Drath rejected the counter offer and went to trial. She did so after having been advised by her lawyers that the top of her standard range was 116 months. In fact, it was 136 months. A jury subsequently convicted Drath of all eight felonies with which the State charged her. The court sentenced her to a standard range sentence of 128 months of confinement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   \u00b699 Drath then filed a motion for a new trial.
