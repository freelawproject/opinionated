We discussed the facts in detail in\n   <em>\n    DeTienne II\n   </em>\n   and here review only those facts necessary to address the relevant issues.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 4 In 2007, DeTienne's mother established The Train Station, LLC, to purchase real property located on Custer Avenue in Helena (the \"Custer Property\"), on which to establish a casino that DeTienne would run through his company, The Money Train, LLC. Because of a delay in financing, DeTienne entered an oral agreement for a short-term gap loan with Sandrock, a local businessman and acquaintance of DeTienne. In exchange for the loan, Sandrock was granted a fifty-percent membership in Train Station. DeTienne's mother's trust, of which DeTienne is now successor Trustee, held the other fifty-percent interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 5 In June 2008, Train Station entered into a fifteen-year lease agreement with Money Train to lease the Custer Property. Money Train operated a casino on the property. Train Station used Money Train's monthly lease payments to pay the monthly mortgage payments on the Custer Property. In November 2009, after a dispute led DeTienne to deposit lease payments into the Trust's bank account instead of the Train Station's bank account, Sandrock filed an action\n   to evict DeTienne and Money Train from the Custer Property. In February 2010, representing that he was the sole member and only interest holder in the assets of Train Station, Sandrock transferred the real property by deed to GG&amp;ME, LLC, a Montana limited liability company, of which he is the managing member. Sandrock secured a new loan on behalf of GG&amp;ME in the amount of $790,000. At the time of closing, the balance of Train Station's mortgage on the property was $629,075, which was paid by GG&amp;ME through the new loan. GG&amp;ME then leased the property to Draes, Inc., a corporation formed that month whose sole shareholders are Sandrock and his wife. Draes operated a casino on the property and paid monthly rent to GG&amp;ME.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 6 In March 2010, DeTienne filed suit against Sandrock, seeking a declaratory judgment that Sandrock's transfer of the property was unlawful because it was done without consent of all Train Station members. Over Sandrock's objection, the District Court allowed DeTienne to file a second amended complaint in February 2015 and instructed Sandrock to respond to DeTienne's complaint within thirty days. Sandrock failed to answer the second amended complaint within that time, and his default was entered in September 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 7 A year later, the District Court issued its Judgment and Judicial Decree, ordering that: (1) Sandrock was dissociated and expelled from membership in Train Station; (2) the previous transfer of the property to GG&amp;ME by Sandrock was \"void and of no force and effect\"; and (3) the leasehold to Draes was void, and the lessees had thirty days to vacate the premises. The court awarded compensatory damages to DeTienne in the amount of $2,083,171, plus specified interest, punitive damages of $150,000, and costs and attorney fees. Sandrock moved the District Court to set aside the default judgment. The motion was deemed denied after sixty days.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 8 Sandrock appealed the District Court's denial of his motion to set aside default judgment and its calculation of damages. We held that the District Court did not slightly abuse its discretion in denying Sandrock's motion for relief and reconsideration of the judgment and judicial decree.\n   <em>\n    DeTienne II\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 42. But because we were unable to discern how the court used various amounts to establish the damages awarded, we remanded the case to the District Court for an order setting forth its recalculation and determination of damages and identification of evidence supporting the recalculation.\n   <em>\n    DeTienne II\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 48.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 9 On remand, the District Court held an evidentiary hearing on compensatory damages. Defense expert Lenore Romney testified\n   and provided an analysis of the lost profits report previously prepared by\n   WIPFLi CPAs and consultants. Plaintiffs' expert Natalya Abdrasilova provided testimony regarding Romney's analysis and provided revisions to the original WIPFLi report. Relying on the revised WIPFLi report and Abdrasilova's testimony, the District Court found that Train Station lost profits in the amount of $922,602, and Money Train lost profits in the amount of $489,033. The District Court reduced the total lost profits by the $120,000 that Sandrock initially contributed and awarded compensatory damages for economic loss in the amount of $1,291,635. The court ordered that prejudgment interest for the total award would accrue from September 11, 2015-the date Sandrock's default was entered. Analyzing DeTienne's claim for punitive damages, the court reaffirmed its previous $150,000 punitive damages award, despite discrepancy in the record regarding Sandrock's net worth. The District Court again awarded attorney fees and costs in the amount of $42,009.05.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARDS OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 10 We review a district court's award of damages for abuse of discretion.\n   <em>\n    Czajkowski v.

Sandrock maintains that he paid down the mortgage on the property from $629,075 to $378,777 before the property was returned to DeTienne and that, if he is\n   required to pay the remaining balance with no offset, DeTienne will recover a windfall.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b6 14 The measure of compensatory damages for a tort is the amount for all the detriment proximately caused by the defendant's conduct, whether it could have been anticipated or not.

Damages must be supported by substantial evidence, not mere guess or speculation, but mathematical precision is not required.\n   <em>\n    In re Marriage of Mease\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 42.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b6 15 The District Court recognized Sandrock's reduction of the debt on the Custer Property to a balance of $378,777, as of the September 28, 2016 judgment. The court's findings on the effect of this mortgage reduction are not entirely clear. DeTienne's expert, Abdrasilova, testified that the original mortgage of the Train Station would have been reduced to $378,777, as of September 30, 2016, when Sandrock was dissociated from Train Station. Abdrasilova lists the mortgage balance as a \"Possible Offset[ ] to Economic Loss\" on Schedule A to her response to Romney's expert report. The District Court found Abdrasilova's calculations to be consistent with the court's prior rulings, \"including the conclusion that loan payments made by GG&amp;ME for its mortgage are not a proper offset to the losses incurred by Train Station.\" Abdrasilova acknowledged at the damages hearing, however, that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   I believe the proper setoff for-or proper offset for the Train Station's losses would be to take a look at the mortgage that\n   existed on that property before it was wrongfully conveyed to the defendants.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   Q. Where does that lead us?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   A. So that leads us to an offset of $378,777, which would have been the balance on the mortgage on the Custer property as of September 30, 2016, had the Money Train remained a tenant at the Custer property.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The court found \"the balance of the mortgage on the Custer property as of September 28, 2016 to be $378,777 as calculated by Abdrasilova, accurately reflecting the most credible evidence presented and legal determinations previously made in this case.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b6 16 The court thus recognized the mortgage, but it nonetheless awarded the full $922,602 without discussing the offset. We are unable to discern whether the District Court intended to offset the mortgage to establish the amount of damages awarded. It first stated that loan payments GG&amp;ME made \"are not a proper offset to the losses incurred\n   by Train Station,\" but then accepted the $378,777 balance as Abdrasilova testified. We may remand an award of damages that does not explain how the amounts are used to establish the award.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    DeTienne II\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 48. It is not clear whether it was an oversight to not offset the damages after recognizing the mortgage or whether the court intentionally did not offset the damages for reasons it did not explain. DeTienne does not separately defend the court's failure to offset the mortgage balance, but argues generally that the court did not abuse its discretion in determining Train Station's total damages. We remand to the District Court with instructions to clarify its determination of damages with reference to the effect of the September 2016 mortgage balance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    Money Train Lost Profits\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b6 17 Sandrock argues that the District Court erroneously relied on Abdrasilova's 2017 revised WIPFLi damage calculations regarding Money Train's lost profits. He contends that the WIPFLi report is speculative and irrational because it changed the basis for its calculations from that used in the 2015 report, comparing Money Train's revenues with Draes's revenues without any analysis or discussion of comparability of the casinos. Sandrock maintains that the court also erred when it failed to offset Money Train's lost profits by DeTienne's personal income from other employment during the years he was wrongfully evicted from the Custer Property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b6 18 Damages for lost profits may be awarded if they are the \"natural and direct result of the act of the defendant\" and the loss is not speculative.\n   <em>\n    Olson v.

The profits are speculative if it is uncertain whether the loss was a result of the wrong or whether the claimed profit would have been derived at all, but not when the amount of such profits is merely uncertain.\n   <em>\n    Olson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2704762\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/249/342/#p348\">\n    249 Mont. at 348\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2704762\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/249/342/#p348\">\n    816 P.2d at 427\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b6 19 The District Court relied on Abdrasilova's testimony and the court's interpretation of the WIPFLi report in determining its award of lost profit damages for Money Train. Sandrock does not contend that his wrongful eviction did not cause lost profits to DeTienne. Sandrock instead challenges the amount of lost profits that the District Court awarded on the basis of Abdrasilova's opinion and the comparison with Draes's casino revenues. The District Court found that if DeTienne had not been evicted from the Custer Property, Money Train would have continued to make a profit. Money Train thus suffered economic loss directly due to Sandrock's actions. Abdrasilova's report specifically described how she calculated Money Train's lost profits. She testified\n   that \"Drae's [sic] is a good benchmark for the Money Train because it's a casino operation that uses the same gaming machines at the exact same location for the same time periods.\" Sandrock's expert disagreed, but the District Court explained it found Abdrasilova's calculations \"an accurate reflection of lost profits for Money Train.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b6 20 The factfinder remains free to disregard an expert's testimony.\n   <em>\n    Willis v.

The court did not abuse its discretion by relying on DeTienne's expert's testimony. Abdrasilova's calculations are not speculative merely because Sandrock disputes the amount. The District Court's award is supported by substantial evidence in the record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b6 21 Finally, Sandrock does not establish support for his argument that the court failed to require DeTienne to mitigate his damages with income from other employment while he was wrongfully evicted from the Custer Property. Abdrasilova's report explained that DeTienne took appropriate steps \"to mitigate his beverage sales losses by employing his liquor license under a different business model,\" and she offset DeTienne's beverage income in her calculations beginning in 2013, when he began to realize income from his new location. The District Court did not abuse its discretion in relying on WIPFLi's report to award Money Train lost profit damages, and we affirm the award.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    Punitive Damages\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00b6 22 Sandrock maintains that the District Court erred in awarding punitive damages because it denied him \"the opportunity to address the reasoning behind his actions\" when the court decided to not have a full rehearing on the issue. DeTienne argues on cross-appeal that the punitive damages should be increased because of Sandrock's representation before this Court that his net worth was more than he originally represented to the District Court. In the first judgment, the District Court found that Sandrock's projected net worth was $5 million. In his affidavit in support of a motion to stay the judgment pending appeal of\n   <em>\n    DeTienne II\n   </em>\n   , Sandrock represented to this Court that his collective net worth was estimated at nearly $6.9 million. DeTienne contends that the punitive damages therefore should be increased to three percent of Sandrock's claimed net worth.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00b6 23 Reasonable punitive damages may be awarded when a defendant has been found guilty of actual fraud or actual malice. Section 27-1-221(1), MCA. Section 27-1-220(3), MCA, provides, \"[a]n award for punitive damages may not exceed $10 million or 3% of a defendant's net worth, whichever is less.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b6 24 We review a district court's punitive damage findings under a three-part test to determine whether they are clearly erroneous.\n   <em>\n    Marie Deonier &amp; Assocs. v.

The court found that punitive damages were appropriate for such egregious behavior. In\n   <em>\n    DeTienne II\n   </em>\n   , this Court did not disturb the District Court's finding that Sandrock acted with actual malice or fraud. Upon review of the District Court's findings and the record, we conclude that Sandrock has not met his burden of proving clear error in awarding punitive damages. We need address further only whether the punitive damages award should be increased.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   \u00b6 26 On remand, recognizing that there \"may be discrepancy regarding Sandrock's current net worth based on testimony and evidence presented,\" the District Court found that the amount of punitive damages awarded previously was appropriate. The court did not make any additional findings regarding Sandrock's net worth. Section 27-1-220(3), MCA, provides the maximum amount of punitive damages that may be awarded, but it does not require the District Court to award that maximum amount. Substantial evidence supports the District Court's findings that\n   punitive damages are appropriate, and there is nothing to suggest that the court misapprehended the effect of the evidence. After review of the record, we are not left with a definite and firm conviction that the District Court made a mistake in failing to award more punitive damages. We therefore affirm the District Court's award of $150,000 in punitive damages.\n   <strong>\n    Other Claims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   \u00b6 27 Sandrock also claims error in the District Court: miscalculating the actual mortgage offset value; failing to account for his fifty-percent ownership interest in Train Station; failing to calculate the fair value of his distributional interest upon dissociation of Train Station; and erroneously calculating the time period of lost profits. DeTienne, in turn, claims that the District Court abused its discretion by not awarding damages associated with other property he refers to as the \"Lyndale Property.\" The District Court thoroughly considered the evaluations and testimony of Sandrock's expert Romney and DeTienne's expert Abdrasilova, and analyzed each element of damages DeTienne claimed and Sandrock disputed. Its findings are supported by substantial evidence. The parties fail to establish clear error in the record or any other legal basis to support a conclusion that the District Court abused its discretion on these issues when it calculated the awarded damages. Upon review of the record and the District Court's findings, we conclude that neither Sandrock nor DeTienne has met his burden of showing that the court abused its broad discretion in awarding damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   \u00b6 28\n   <em>\n    2. Did the District Court properly award prejudgment interest on the damages award?\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   \u00b6 29 Sandrock contends that DeTienne is not entitled to any prejudgment interest because the damages are incapable of being made certain and that no right to recovery vested until the District Court entered its December 11, 2017 order. DeTienne responds that the District Court fully explained Train Station's lost profit damages as capable of being calculated with certainty and that it vested on a particular day. On cross-appeal, however, he contends that the right to recover Train Station's damages vested on December 1, 2009, not on September 11, 2015. DeTienne does not argue that Money Train's damages vested on December 1, 2009.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   \u00b6 30 The decision to award prejudgment interest is reviewed to determine whether the district court correctly interpreted the law.\n   <em>\n    DiMarzio v.

We address each entity's damages separately.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <strong>\n    Train Station Damages\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   \u00b6 32 The District Court awarded $922,602 in damages for Train Station. As to the first factor, neither party disputes that there was an underlying monetary obligation. As to the second factor, the court set forth a specific, certain calculation for the compensatory damages awarded to Train Station based almost exclusively on lost lease payments. The District Court calculated Train Station's lost profits according to the WIPFLi report analysis: monthly lease payments that would have been paid by Money Train during the wrongful eviction, plus income from a sign lease at the property, minus lease income received from Money Train, with deductions for property taxes to be paid after ownership transfer and saved expenses for Money Train. All figures in the calculation were ascertainable when DeTienne and Money Train were wrongfully evicted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   \u00b6 33 Finally, we examine whether the right to recovery vested on a particular date. On cross-appeal DeTienne argues that the date the right vested was December 1, 2009-the date he was evicted from the Custer Property-and not September 11, 2015, as the District Court held. DeTienne's cause of action arose when he was wrongfully evicted from the Custer Property, rendering him unable to use the profits for a productive purpose. Prejudgment interest accrues from the date the right to recover vested.\n   <em>\n    Stafford\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 30 ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Carriger v.

Sandrock argues that prejudgment interest is inappropriate because the damages rely on projected business operating expenses and require a factual determination by a fact finder. DeTienne does not address prejudgment interest as to Money Train's damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   \u00b6 35 We have explained that \u00a7 27-2-211, MCA, allows \"no interest [to] run until a fixed amount of damages has been arrived at, either by agreement, appraisal, or judgment.\"\n   <em>\n    Carriger\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2553287\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/192/479/#p486\">\n    192 Mont. at 486\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2553287\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/192/479/#p486\">\n    628 P.2d at 1110\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Sandrock's expert Romney and DeTienne's expert Abdrasilova disagreed on how to calculate the lost profits. Sandrock opined that Money Train suffered \"no economic loss\" because it actually earned $375,704 more during the wrongful eviction than it would have had it remained a tenant of the Custer Property. Abdrasilova used Draes's gaming revenue and gaming industry data to calculate the $489,033 lost profits, which the District Court accepted. What's more, Abdrasilova changed her calculation of Money Train's damages by using Montana gaming industry revenue data when she had used national industry data in her 2015 calculations. Money Train's lost profits were not based upon a\n   previously agreed amount or a sum certain balance. The lost profits could not be ascertained until the District Court made its findings following the damages hearing and calculated the damages. Although Money Train did lose profits and its\n   right to recover those profits started the day that it was evicted from the Custer Property, because the amount of recovery was not readily ascertainable until determined by the trial court, Money Train is not entitled to prejudgment interest. We reverse the award of prejudgment interest on Money Train's lost profits and remand for entry of a corrected judgment excluding the interest on Money Train's damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   \u00b6 37\n   <em>\n    3.

We upheld that ruling in\n   <em>\n    DeTienne II\n   </em>\n   . The court found that Sandrock's \"malicious and fraudulent conduct meets the statutory threshold for an award of attorney fees as acting 'artibrarily, [sic] vexatiously, or not in good faith.' \" Section 35-8-809(4), MCA, supplies a statutory basis under the Montana Limited Liability Act for the fee award. Contrary to Sandrock's assertion that the Act is not\n   applicable to this case, several claims in DeTienne's second amended complaint arose under the Montana Limited Liability Act, including the dissociation claim that was again at issue on remand.
