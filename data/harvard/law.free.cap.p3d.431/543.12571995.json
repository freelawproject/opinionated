In addition, Perry claims that neither the jury's finding by special verdict nor the court's findings of fact provide a sufficient basis on which to justify the exceptional sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 3 In his statement of additional grounds (SAG), Perry expresses concerns related to judicial bias. He also argues that the jury's guilty verdict is invalid because, he claims, the to-convict instructions are inconsistent with RCW 46.52.020.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 4 In the published portion of this opinion, we hold that the jury's finding on the special verdict form does justify an exceptional sentence, because the \"substantially exceeds\" aggravating factor applies to a conviction for the crime of hit and run (injury). We further hold that the jury's finding by special verdict alone provides a sufficient basis on which to justify Perry's exceptional sentence. Nevertheless, we hold the trial court erred when it made findings of fact in addition to those made by the jury to support the exceptional sentence. In the unpublished portion of this opinion, we hold that Perry's SAG claims fail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 5 Accordingly, we reverse Perry's sentence and remand for resentencing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   FACTS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Substantive Facts\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 6 In March 2016, Ryan Moore and his brother, Trevor Moore,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   were out for a late night walk. They were walking on the left side of the street with Trevor walking closer to the ditch on the side of the road and Moore walking on Trevor's right next to the shoulder. Trevor heard a vehicle approaching from behind them. He glanced back, noted that the vehicle was traveling in the same direction they were walking, and driving straight \"like it should.\" Verbatim Report of Proceedings (VRP) (Jan. 18, 2017) at 168. He then turned back around to face forward and,\n   without warning, the vehicle collided with Moore from behind, missing Trevor by a foot. The force of the impact threw Moore 6 to 8 feet between two reflective signs. He hit the ground and rolled to a stop on the pavement. Trevor testified that the vehicle kept driving and never stopped or slowed down; he stated he never saw any brake lights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 7 Perry claims that he was reaching for something he dropped on the floor of his truck when he heard the truck hit something. After he realized his vehicle hit something, he claims he took his foot off the accelerator and sat up. While his vehicle decelerated, Perry said he assessed the damage to his truck and looked back to see what he had hit. He noticed two poles with reflective signs where he believed there had been three and concluded he had hit one of the poles. He claims he did not see Moore or Trevor. Perry then drove home, deciding to report the accident in the morning. Perry gave the same information to investigating officers who located his damaged vehicle in his driveway the next morning.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 8 Moore suffered multiple injuries, including a neck fracture, various pelvic fractures, an arm fracture, a leg fracture, pulmonary contusions, acute blood loss anemia, a scalp laceration, and a kidney laceration. He was hospitalized for six days following the accident and underwent multiple surgeries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Procedural Facts\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 9 The State charged Perry with one count of hit and run (injury) under RCW 46.52.020(4)(b). The State later filed an amended information giving notice of its intent to seek an exceptional sentence based on the aggravating fact that Moore's injuries had substantially exceeded the level of bodily harm necessary to satisfy the elements of the offense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 10 The case proceeded to jury trial. After the close of evidence, the State proposed jury instructions on the definition of \"bodily harm\" and how to decide whether the \"substantially exceeded\" aggravating factor existed, as well as a special interrogatory addressing the aggravating factor. Defense counsel objected to the proposed instructions related to bodily harm and the aggravating factor, as well as the special interrogatory, arguing that the aggravating factor did not apply because bodily harm was not an element of the charged offense. Over defense counsel's objection, the trial court instructed the jury, in pertinent part, as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   INSTRUCTION NO.\n   <em>\n    8\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   Bodily harm means physical pain or injury, illness, or an impairment of physical condition.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   INSTRUCTION NO.\n   <em>\n    9\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   In deciding whether the victim's injuries substantially exceeded the level of bodily harm necessary to constitute bodily harm, you should compare the injuries suffered by the victim to the minimum injury that would satisfy the definition of bodily harm set out in instruction 8.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Clerk's Papers (CP) at 38-39. The special verdict form related to these instructions asked the jury the following question: \"Did the victim's injuries substantially exceed the level of bodily harm necessary to constitute bodily harm, as defined in Instruction 8.\" CP at 44.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b6 11 The jury found Perry guilty of the crime of hit and run (injury). The jury also found that Moore's injuries substantially exceeded the level of bodily harm necessary to constitute bodily harm as defined by the instructions. The sentencing court imposed a 36-month exceptional sentence and entered the following findings of fact and conclusions of law in support of its decision:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   <em>\n    FINDINGS OF FACT\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   1. On January 19, 2017, the jury found the defendant, Mr. Perry, guilty of Hit and Run Injury Accident.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   2. The jury found, unanimously and beyond a reasonable doubt, and by special interrogatory that the injuries in this case substantially exceeded the level necessary to prove the element of injury in the crime of Hit and Run Injury.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   3. The victim in this case, Ryan Moore, may very likely have died had his brother not been walking along the road with him, which is a substantial and compelling reason to impose an exceptional sentence.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   4. The Court takes Mr. Perry's criminal history into consideration in finding there is a substantial and compelling reason to impose an exceptional sentence.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   5. The failure to stop and render aid in this case does not have any excuse in the view of the jury and in the view of this Court, which is a substantial and compelling reason to impose an exceptional sentence.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   6. The unwillingness to stop and see if anybody had in fact been hurt gives rise to two very unflattering implications: it shows extreme recklessness or carelessness and the other shows a level of consciousness of guilt and fleeing to avoid other potential different or magnifying legal problems. These are substantial and compelling reasons to impose an exceptional sentence.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   <em>\n    CONCLUSIONS OF LAW\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   On the basis of the foregoing findings of Fact and the record and file herein, the Court makes the following conclusions of law:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   1. There are substantial and compelling reasons justifying an exceptional sentence above Mr. Perry's standard range of six to twelve months.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   2.

Br. of Appellant at 9-10. The State argues that \"bodily harm\" and \"injury\" are interchangeable terms such that the \"substantially exceeds\" aggravating factor applies to the crime of hit and run (injury). Br. of Resp't at 12-20. For the following reasons, we agree with the State.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   \u00b6 18 The State charged Perry under RCW 46.52.020(4)(b), which provides as follows: \"Any driver covered by the provisions of subsection (1)\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n   of this section failing to stop or comply with any of the requirements of subsection (3)\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n   of this section in the case of an accident resulting in injury is guilty of a class C felony and, upon conviction, is punishable according to chapter 9A.20 RCW.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   \u00b6 19 A trial court can impose an exceptional sentence if \"[t]he victim's injuries substantially exceed the level of bodily harm necessary to satisfy the elements of the offense.\" Former RCW 9.94A.535(3)(y) (2013).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   \u00b6 20 Because this issue is, in part, a question of statutory interpretation, we begin by looking at the plain language of the relevant statutes.\n   <em>\n    State v.

We also determine the plain meaning of a statutory provision from the general context of the statute, related provisions, and the statutory scheme as a whole.\n   <em>\n    State v. Jacobs\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5629022\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/154/596/#p600\">\n    154 Wash.2d 596\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 600,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=115%20P.3d%20281\">\n    115 P.3d 281\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2005).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   \u00b6 21 RCW 46.52.020 generally states, \"A driver of any vehicle involved in an accident resulting in the injury to or death of any person,\" \"failing to stop or comply\" with various requirements set forth in the statute has committed the crime of hit and run (injury). The legislature did not explicitly prescribe the level of bodily harm required to satisfy the hit and run (injury) statute; instead, the statute states that \"an accident resulting in\n   <em>\n    injury\n   </em>\n   \" is sufficient to satisfy that element of the offense. Former RCW 9.94A.535(3)(y) ; RCW 46.52.020(1), (4)(b) (emphasis added). Although the hit and run statute does not define the term \"injury,\" the provision Perry was charged with is a class C felony, and the Washington Criminal Code defines \"bodily injury\" \"physical injury\" and \"bodily harm\" as \"physical pain or injury, illness, or an impairment of physical condition.\" RCW 9A.04.110(4)(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   \u00b6 22 Because the applicable hit and run statute contemplates an \"accident resulting in the\n   <em>\n    injury to or death\n   </em>\n   of any person,\" the general context of the statute strongly suggests\n   the legislature intended the term \"injury\" to include \"bodily injury,\" \"physical injury,\" and \"bodily harm.\" RCW 46.52.020 ; RCW 9A.04.110(4)(a). Thus, we hold the plain language of the term \"injury\" as used in RCW 46.52.020(4) is unambiguous: It interchangeably means \"[b]odily injury,\" \"physical injury,\" or \"bodily harm\" as defined by RCW 9A.04.110(4)(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   \u00b6 23 In sum, RCW 46.52.020(4) requires \"injury to or death of any person.\" The term \"injury\" interchangeably means \"[b]odily injury,\" \"physical injury,\" or \"bodily harm\" as defined by RCW 9A.04.110(4)(a). The aggravating factor requires a level of bodily harm that \"substantially exceeds\" that necessary to satisfy the crime of hit and run (injury). Former RCW 9.94A.535(3)(y) ; RCW 46.52.020. Therefore, we hold the aggravator by its terms applies to hit and run (injury). Because the trial court provided these definitions to the jury in instruction numbers 8 and 9, we hold the trial court did not err when it provided the jury with the special interrogatory.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   C.\n   <em>\n    Exceptional Sentence Justified\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   \u00b6 24 Perry next claims that the jury's finding by special verdict alone provides an insufficient basis on which to justify his exceptional sentence. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   \u00b6 25 A trial court may impose a sentence outside the standard sentence range for an offense if it finds that there are substantial and compelling reasons justifying an exceptional sentence. Former RCW 9.94A.535. One substantial and compelling reason justifying the imposition of an exceptional sentence is a situation where \"[t]he victim's injuries substantially exceed the level of bodily harm necessary to satisfy the elements of the offense.\" Former RCW 9.94A.535(3)(y).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   \u00b6 26 Our legislature has defined various levels of \"bodily harm\" as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   \"Bodily injury,\" \"physical injury,\" or \"bodily harm\" means physical pain or injury, illness, or an impairment of physical condition;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   \"Substantial bodily harm\" means bodily injury which involves a temporary but substantial disfigurement, or which causes a temporary but substantial loss or impairment of the function of any bodily part or organ, or which causes a fracture of any bodily part;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   \"Great bodily harm\" means bodily injury which creates a probability of death, or which causes significant serious permanent disfigurement, or which causes a significant permanent loss or impairment of the function of any bodily part or organ.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   RCW 9A.04.110(4)(a)-(c). If the jury finds, unanimously and beyond a reasonable doubt, one or more of the facts alleged by the State in support of an aggravated sentence, the trial court may sentence the offender pursuant to former RCW 9.94A.535 to a term of confinement up to the maximum allowed under RCW 9A.20.021 for the underlying conviction if it finds that the facts found are substantial and compelling reasons justifying an exceptional sentence.
