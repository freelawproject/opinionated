They argue the trial court committed error in making evidentiary determinations, refusing to tender certain jury instructions, and declining to award sanctions for a purported discovery violation. For the reasons that follow, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    Factual and Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b62 In 2015, the City of Tucson filed an eminent domain complaint in superior court seeking to condemn a parcel of real property owned by the Tannos. The city sought to acquire the property for the development of the \"Downtown Links,\" a proposed roadway project it asserted was for public use. In response, the Tannos requested a determination of the value of the condemned property and a jury trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b63 After the conclusion of discovery, the city filed several motions in limine seeking to exclude portions of expert testimony disclosed by the Tannos, portions of Cheryl's testimony regarding the value of her property, and evidence relating to certain legal theories advanced by the Tannos. After conducting three hearings, the trial court granted the majority of the city's motions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b64 The case proceeded to a jury trial, where the sole issue was the value of the Tanno property. At trial, the court reaffirmed its prior evidentiary rulings, in some instances considering more evidence than was available at the time of its pretrial rulings. The jury returned a verdict in favor of the Tannos, awarding them $365,910 for the fair market value of the property. The trial court issued a final, appealable judgment based on the jury's verdict. We have jurisdiction pursuant to A.R.S. \u00a7 12-2101(A)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    Eminent Domain\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b65 In Arizona, the state, a county, city, town, village, political subdivision, or person, may exercise the right of eminent domain to acquire property for public use.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   A.R.S. \u00a7 12-1111.

The court thus concluded that any decrease in value caused by the ADOT project would not have been recoverable as damages caused by development of the Downtown Links project. In doing so, the court concluded the ADOT project had been abandoned \"in or about the year 2000,\" and further concluded \"the City began planning the Downtown Links Project in approximately 2005 or 2006.\" As a result, the court precluded the Tannos \"from seeking damages for 'Condemnation Blight' allegedly caused by the State of Arizona's plans and activities related to the [ADOT project].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b610 The Tannos have not established the trial court abused its discretion, as there was reasonable evidence to support the court's conclusion that the Downtown Links was distinguishable from the ADOT project.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Peters\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"708607\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/119/34/#p36\">\n    119 Ariz. at 36\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"708607\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/119/34/#p36\">\n    579 P.2d at 74\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Plans for the Downtown Links also include a parkway-style roadway, but with plans to include landscaping, major infrastructure for rainwater drainage, and a speed limit of thirty miles per hour.

It also noted that even if there was some evidence to show that assemblage was probable, the expert's opinion on the value of the property apparently did not depend on an assemblage theory. The expert assigned the same value to the Tannos' property both as a single parcel and under an assemblage theory. The court thus concluded \"the theory of assemblage is of very minimal relevance and its relevance is substantially outweighed by Rule 403 considerations of wasting time and confusing the issues and misleading the jury.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ariz.

Thus, the court could have reasonably concluded that theory had minimal probative value to the expert's testimony. Accordingly, it was within the court's discretion to preclude evidence of assemblage if its probative value was substantially outweighed by the dangers of wasting time, confusing the issues, or misleading the jury, as it did here.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ariz.

The Tannos did not raise any argument premised upon Rule 56 in any of their written responses opposing the city's motions in limine. In response to the trial court's questioning at a pretrial hearing, however, the Tannos argued \"[i]f [the admissibility of evidence of assemblage] were a question of law, it should have been brought up as a motion for partial summary judgment.\" While not particularly well-developed below, we conclude the issue as it relates to evidence of best use (or assemblage) was sufficiently preserved for our review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b622 Based on the briefs submitted on appeal, the arguments of counsel at oral argument before this court, and our own review of the record, it appears the Tannos failed to raise a Rule 56 challenge to the project influence and owner testimony regarding value rulings below.

Moreover, the Tannos presented these arguments in their opening brief, and the city has been afforded the opportunity to, and did in fact, respond to them in its answering brief.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1502957\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/151/477/#p479\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   We thus conclude it is appropriate for us to address the Tannos' Rule 56 argument in its entirety.

In support of their argument, the Tannos rely on two extra-jurisdictional cases holding a claim or defense may not be dismissed in a motion in limine.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Meyer Intellectual Props.

The trial court's rulings did not preclude the Tannos from pursuing their claim, which ultimately resulted in a monetary judgment in their favor. Rather, the court's rulings limited the evidence that could be introduced in support of the claim. As such, the court's rulings involved \"disputed\n   evidentiary issue[s]\" of relevance and Rule 403 considerations, which may be properly considered in a motion in limine.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ariz.

But, they fail to meaningfully develop this argument. They do not cite any legal authority requiring the court to tender the instructions proposed, do not argue which instructions should have been given, and do not meaningfully establish how the instructions would have been supported by the facts in evidence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ariz.

Again, they fail to meaningfully develop this argument. Aside from providing a citation to Rule 37, Ariz. R. Civ. P., which generally affords the trial court discretion to award sanctions, their argument lacks citations to the record and argument supported by legal authority.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ariz. R. Civ. App. P. 13(a)(7).

According to the report, the ADOT project was largely completed in the 1980s with the exception of the final mile, which was not built due to \"lack of funding and lack of community support.\" Responsibility for the final mile of the project was thus relinquished to the City of Tucson in 1989.
