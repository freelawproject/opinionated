Peeler appeals the judgment of the Montana Nineteenth Judicial District Court, Lincoln County, granting Defendants' Rocky Mountain Log Homes Canada, Inc. (Rocky Mountain) and White River Contracting, LLC (White River) motion to compel arbitration and dismiss the case. We address the following restated issues:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-9\">\n   <em>\n    1. Whether the District Court erroneously concluded that the arbitration agreement required arbitration of matters within its scope rather than merely authorizing it as a matter of discretion upon timely demand?\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-10\">\n   <em>\n    2.

Whether the District Court erroneously failed to conclude that, as a non-party to the agreement, Rocky Mountain lacked standing to enforce the arbitration agreement against Peeler?\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b62 We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b63 Peeler is a Florida resident who owns property in Libby, Montana. As alleged, Rocky Mountain is a Montana business corporation and White River is a Montana limited liability company. Hamilton, Montana is the principal place of business for both companies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b64 In July 2013, Peeler and Rocky Mountain executed a \"Plan Development Agreement\" (Design Contract) for Rocky Mountain to design and produce construction plans for a custom log home on Peeler's property to be built by a third-party contractor. The Design Contract expressly contemplated that Rocky Mountain would manufacture and deliver the necessary log package to Peeler's property under a separate contract. By separate written agreement dated September 19, 2013, Peeler executed a written contract (Construction Contract) with Rocky Mountain's\n   affiliate, White River, to construct a finished \"turn-[k]ey\" home in accordance with the building plans produced by Rocky Mountain under the Design Contract. The Construction Contract specified a contract price of $817,655.06, completion in 2014, and that White River would provide all necessary materials and labor.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   In contrast to the Design Contract which included no similar provision, the Construction Contract included an arbitration agreement, to wit:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   All disputes, claims and questions regarding the rights and obligations of the parties under the terms of this Agreement are subject to arbitration. Either party may make a demand for\n   arbitration by filing such demand in writing with the other party within 30 (thirty) days after the dispute first arises. Thereafter, binding arbitration shall be conducted by three arbitrators acting under the rules of commercial arbitration of the American Arbitration Association or such other method of arbitration as agreed upon between the parties.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <em>\n    Inter alia\n   </em>\n   , the Construction Contract also included a \"No Waiver\" provision stating that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   The failure of either party ... to insist upon the performance of any of the terms and conditions of this Agreement, or the waiver of any breach of any of the terms and conditions of this Agreement, shall not be construed as thereafter waiving any such terms and conditions, but these shall continue and remain in full force and effect as if no such forbearance or waiver had occurred.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b65 Following a 2013 start, construction dragged on into 2016. Dissatisfied with the progress and quality of construction following unsuccessful attempts to resolve his concerns, Peeler filed a complaint against White River and Rocky Mountain in the Montana Nineteenth Judicial District Court on September 16, 2016. In pertinent part, the complaint stated that the \"issues giving rise to this [c]omplaint involve\n   <em>\n    a construction contract\n   </em>\n   ... and related claims for negligence and other torts\n   <em>\n    arising out of work performed\n   </em>\n   on Plaintiff's property....\" (Emphasis added.) The complaint asserted specific claims for breach of contract, contract bad faith, breach of various warranties, negligence, negligent misrepresentation, fraud, constructive fraud, tortious conversion, unjust enrichment, statutory unfair trade practices, and negligent infliction of emotional distress. None of the asserted claims challenged the validity or enforceability of the arbitration agreement in the Construction Contract. The complaint further asserted no independent claim against Rocky Mountain, only that, \"[u]pon information and belief,\" Rocky Mountain and White River were \"affiliated business entities, and therefore should be treated as one and the same.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b66 Peeler did not initially serve the complaint on White River or\n   Rocky Mountain. Rather, by correspondence to White River dated October 6, 2016, Peeler declared the Construction Contract terminated based on various alleged material breaches of the contract and asserted negligence. White River disputed Peeler's allegations by correspondence dated October 19, 2016. A month later, Peeler served his previously filed complaint separately on White River and Rocky Mountain.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b67 By motion filed December 30, 2016, White River initially appeared in the action and moved pursuant to M. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1) and \u00a7 27-5-115, MCA, for an order compelling arbitration and dismissing Peeler's complaint. On January 11, 2017, Peeler filed a\n   response opposing the motion on the asserted grounds that arbitration was not mandatory under the agreement and that White River in any event waived its right to compel arbitration by failing to timely demand it within 30 days after the dispute arose as referenced in the Construction Contract. Upon leave of court, Peeler filed a \"supplemental response\" bolstering his prior assertion that the Defendants waived the right to compel arbitration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b68 By notice filed March 2, 2017, Rocky Mountain first appeared in the action and joined in White River's motion to compel arbitration and dismiss. Peeler subsequently moved to strike Rocky Mountain's notice of joinder on the asserted ground that Rocky Mountain had no standing to compel arbitration under a contract to which it was not a party. In response, Rocky Mountain asserted that it had standing to compel arbitration on the Construction Contract based on Peeler's complaint allegations that the Defendants were affiliated entities who were \"one and the same\" and that Rocky Mountain was liable on the Construction Contract for the asserted defects. Though acknowledging that he may need to amend his complaint to state separate claims against Rocky Mountain upon further discovery, Peeler continued to maintain that Rocky Mountain had no standing to enforce the arbitration agreement in the Construction Contract despite the fact that he was suing Rocky Mountain on the Construction Contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b69 Almost nine months after his response to Rocky Mountain's notice of joinder, while White River's motion to compel arbitration was still pending decision, Peeler moved for leave to amend his original complaint as manifested in an attached proposed amended complaint. Generally characterizing the included claims as \"breaches of contract, negligence, and other tort claims, including [a claim for] property damage,\" the proposed amended complaint: (1) more particularly stated breach of contract, contract bad faith, breach of contract warranties, negligence, negligent misrepresentation, fraud,\n   constructive fraud, statutory unfair trade practices, negligent infliction of emotional distress, and punitive damages claims separately against each Defendant based on or related to their respective Design and Construction Contracts; (2) stated a declaratory judgment claim against Rocky Mountain asserting that a waiver provision in the Design Contract was void; (3) stated a declaratory judgment claim against White River asserting that it waived the right to compel arbitration and that the arbitration provision was in any event \"void as a matter of public policy\"; and (4) stated claims against both Defendants for \"joint and several liability\" and \"pierc[ing] the corporate veil.\" However, as in his original complaint, the proposed amended complaint again ambiguously alleged that Rocky Mountain and White River were \"affiliated business entities, and therefore should be treated as one and the same.\" On January 17, 2018, with decisions on White River's motion to compel arbitration and Peeler's motion for leave to amend still pending, Peeler filed an \"amended motion\" for leave to file a \"revised\" amended complaint based on the asserted recent discovery that White River and Rocky Mountain were \"part of a larger conglomerate,\" that \"it appear[ed] that [Rocky Mountain] operated on its own,\" that \"Montana Sundown, Inc. did business as 'Rocky Mountain Log Homes,' \" and that White River and Rocky Mountain, \"together with their individual shareholders, bear some liability in this case.\" Unlike before, Peeler did not attach a copy of the proposed revised amended complaint to his amended motion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b610 On January 24, 2018, without reference to Peeler's successive motions for leave to file an amended complaint, the District Court issued a written order granting White River's motion to compel arbitration and accordingly dismissed the action. In accordance with Peeler's complaint averment, the court \"treated\" White River and Rocky Mountain \"as one and the same.\" Characterizing Peeler's waiver assertion as an issue of \"procedural arbitrability\" rather than \"substantive arbitrability,\" the court granted the motion pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Mont.

To the contrary, in his original and proposed amended complaints, Peeler seeks to sue on the Construction Contract for breach of express and implied duties and warranties, breaches of related but distinct duties that arise or exist independently as matters of statutory or common law, and declaratory judgment construing the meaning or effect of contract provisions. Putting aside for the moment the question of whether, and to what extent, Rocky Mountain may enforce the arbitration agreement against him, Peeler did not raise any challenge in District Court regarding the validity or enforceability of the arbitration agreement apart from the balance of the larger contract.

Here, Peeler's assertion that the Defendants waived their right to compel arbitration by failing to timely demand it within 30 days of\n   the initial dispute is an assertion of procedural timeliness or waiver that neither limits nor otherwise affects the scope of substantive issues or types of issues the parties agreed to arbitrate. Whether a party waived the right to compel arbitration by failing to timely demand it in compliance with procedural requirements of the agreement is \"a classic question of procedural arbitrability\" for determination by an arbitrator rather than the court.\n   <em>\n    MPEA\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 10. Thus, Peeler's assertion of procedural timeliness or waiver based on the Defendants' failure to demand arbitration within 30 days from the date the dispute arose as specified in the agreement was a matter of procedural arbitrability for\n   determination by the arbitrator in conjunction with the non-waiver provision of the contract and any other relevant legal or factual consideration. We hold that the District Court correctly concluded that, by its terms, the arbitration agreement required arbitration of all matters within its scope and that Peeler's procedural timeliness or waiver assertion was a matter of procedural arbitrability for consideration in arbitration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b621 2.\n   <em>\n    Whether the District Court erroneously failed to conclude that the Defendants equitably waived the right to arbitrate?\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \u00b622 In a matter related but distinct from his assertion of procedural waiver, Peeler asserts that, as a matter of substantive arbitrability, the Defendants equitably waived the right to arbitrate by failing to demand arbitration until after he instituted this litigation.

At most, the Defendants failed to demand arbitration until the need definitely arose-when\n   Peeler sued them in disregard of the arbitration agreement. At no time did either Defendant disclaim arbitration or make any statement manifesting an affirmative intent to forego it. Both properly asserted the right to arbitrate upon their respective initial appearances in this action by way of motion to compel arbitration and dismiss. While decision pended on their motion to compel under M. R. Civ. P. 12(b), neither Defendant filed an answer, asserted a counterclaim, demanded a trial, or otherwise engaged in litigation in furtherance of judgment on the merits. Efforts to informally resolve the dispute with Peeler including,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , participating in mediation, do not constitute affirmative acts or conduct inconsistent with the right to arbitrate rather than litigate. Defendants' responses in opposition to Peeler's efforts to forego or avoid arbitration likewise evinced no intent to forego arbitration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   \u00b625 Peeler's equitable waiver theory similarly fails on the prejudice element. He asserts that the Defendants' failure to sooner demand arbitration substantially prejudiced his right to a jury trial and will now further render wasted the substantial costs expended on litigation to date. However, this asserted prejudice is self-inflicted. Peeler, not the Defendants, chose to institute litigation in disregard of the clear and unequivocally broad arbitration agreement. He is also exclusively responsible for pleading Construction Contract-based claims jointly against White River and Rocky Mountain as \"one and the same.\" Peeler simply failed to demonstrate the requisite elements of an equitable waiver in District Court.

Thus, concluding that the arbitration agreement\n   did not include a \"clear and unmistakable\" delegation provision, we held that the district court did not erroneously consider the debtor's asserted arbitrability defense rather than leaving it for the arbitrator.\n   <em>\n    Global\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 29-33.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   \u00b636 Here, under the circumstances of this case, the only possible pertinence of\n   <em>\n    Rent-A-Center\n   </em>\n   's layered severability rule is as a basis upon which Peeler's proposed void-for-public-policy claim could have been susceptible to a liberal construction that would have warranted judicial consideration of the claim for purposes of M. R. Civ. P. 15(a) prior to compelling arbitration. However, the language of the White River arbitration agreement is similar to the language of the agreements in\n   <em>\n    Rent-A-Center\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Global\n   </em>\n   only to the extent that, like every prospective arbitration agreement, it stated the parties' base agreement to arbitrate a specified scope of future disputes that may arise independent of the arbitration agreement. Regardless of language generally providing that arbitration would proceed under the rules of the American Arbitration Association as in\n   <em>\n    Global\n   </em>\n   , the language of the arbitration agreement at issue, unlike the language of the agreements in\n   <em>\n    Rent-A-Center\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Global\n   </em>\n   , makes no reference to arbitration of disputes regarding the threshold enforceability or application of the arbitration agreement itself. Thus, unlike in\n   <em>\n    Rent-A-Center\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Global\n   </em>\n   , the White River arbitration agreement includes no indication of intent, ambiguous or not, to contract around or out of the general rule of substantive arbitrability as a threshold matter for judicial determination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   \u00b637 Delegation clause disputes arise in the narrow circumstance where the party seeking to avoid arbitration asserts that threshold arbitrability issues exist for judicial determination and the party seeking to compel arbitration counters that the language of the arbitration agreement reserved or delegated those issues to arbitration.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Global\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 13-18 ;\n   <em>\n    Rent-A-Center\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12455276,3644316\" index=\"176\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/561/63/\">\n    561 U.S. at 70-76\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3644316,12455276\" index=\"177\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/130/2772/\">\n    130 S.Ct. at 2777-81\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . No such dispute exists here. The District Court addressed the\n   <em>\n    cognizable\n   </em>\n   arbitrability issues raised by Peeler and the Defendants neither assert that the arbitration agreement included a delegation provision, nor otherwise contest the court's authority to address the arbitrability issues addressed. Peeler simply asserts that the court erroneously\n   <em>\n    failed to address\n   </em>\n   his procedural waiver assertion and further erroneously decided the gateway arbitrability issues that it did address. Peeler's proposed one-line claim that \"[t]he arbitration provision contained within the [Construction Contract] is void as a matter of public policy\" was thus patently insufficient to raise a specific delegation provision challenge for judicial determination under\n   <em>\n    Rent-A-Center\n   </em>\n   's layered severability rule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   \u00b638 Whether as a challenge to the enforceability of the arbitration agreement itself or as a narrower delegation clause challenge, Peeler's proposed void-for-public-policy claim was futile as a matter of law.

He thus asserts that the agreement was not applicable to his non-contract claims based on alleged breaches of legal duties that existed or arose independent of the contract. Peeler further similarly asserts pursuant to \u00a7 27-5-114(2)(a), MCA, that his asserted negligent infliction of emotional distress claim was not subject to arbitration because contract arbitration provisions do not apply to \"claims arising out of personal injury.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   \u00b641 We generally will not review issues raised for the first time on appeal.\n   <em>\n    Martz\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 25.

Here, Peeler acknowledges that he did not raise either of these issues before the District Court but asserts that he is nonetheless entitled to raise them on appeal because the District Court raised them\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   as bases for\n   granting the motion to compel arbitration. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   \u00b642 Peeler relies on two cherry-picked references in the court's written order to the effect that his \"claims fall within the arbitration clause.\" However, in context, the court noted that \"all parties agree the claims fall within the arbitration clause\" and that Peeler merely \"argues the time limit for arbitrating was not met.\" After squarely addressing the narrow waiver issue actually raised, the District Court similarly stated in closing that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   the Agreement's arbitration clause is intended to address \"all disputes, claims and questions regarding the rights and obligations of the parties under the terms of the Agreement.\" There appears to be no dispute that [Peeler's] claims fall within\n   that provision. Nor has any party disputed the validity of the parties' agreement to arbitrate.

Peeler's assertion that the District Court\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   raised and relied on an unbriefed issue as a basis for its decision on the narrow issue presented is a mischaracterization of the court's order. By failing to raise them in opposition to White River's motion to compel and dismiss, Peeler waived the right to appeal the issues of whether his asserted non-contract claims were substantively arbitrable within the express language of the arbitration agreement and, as applicable, the asserted limitation of \u00a7 27-5-114(2)(a), MCA.

As long as sufficiently founded therein or intertwined therewith, the claims asserted by the party against the non-party need not rely exclusively on the terms of the larger agreement in which the arbitration agreement is included.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   \u00b648 Here, Peeler's original complaint asserted that Rocky Mountain and White River were \"affiliated business entities, and therefore should be treated as one and the same.\" It asserted various contract, tort, and statutory claims against them jointly-all expressly based on, or arising out of, the White River Construction Contract without reference to the Rocky Mountain Design Contract or conduct thereunder. Though his asserted compensatory tort and statutory claims were based on alleged breaches of\n   <em>\n    duties\n   </em>\n   that arise as matters of law independent of the duties imposed by the Construction Contract, all of the alleged factual\n   <em>\n    breaches\n   </em>\n   of the asserted contract, tort, and\n   statutory duties were nonetheless based on the same or closely related factual acts or omissions. Overarching all of the asserted claims, Peeler's complaint asserted without qualification that the \"issues giving rise to this [c]omplaint involve\n   <em>\n    a construction contract\n   </em>\n   ... and related claims for negligence and other torts\n   <em>\n    arising out of work performed\n   </em>\n   on Plaintiff's property....\" (Emphasis added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   \u00b649 Filed on the figurative eve before decision on the fully submitted, potentially dispositive motion to compel arbitration that had then been pending for nine months, Peeler's proposed amended complaint did not substantially change the nature or juxtaposition of the parties or the related nature of the factual bases for the claims against them. As a threshold matter, the proposed amended complaint indeed proposed to state claims separately against White River and Rocky Mountain based on the distinct natures, related duties, and alleged breaches of the separate Design and Construction Contracts. Nevertheless, the proposed amended complaint again alleged that White River and Rocky Mountain were \"affiliated business entities, and therefore should be treated as one and the same.\" It generally \"allege[d] breaches of contract, negligence, and other tort claims, including property damage, with respect to [Peeler's] home in Lincoln County, Montana.\" The proposed amended complaint further alleged facts indicating that the separate Design and Construction Contracts cross-referenced and were interdependent on each other and that the Defendants acted in concert with each other thereunder. Finally, in a separate proposed count expressly applicable to both Defendants without distinction or segregation as to claims or claimed damages, the proposed amended complaint further alleged that Rocky Mountain and White River were \"jointly and severally liable\" for Peeler's alleged damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   \u00b650 Peeler's challenge to the arbitrability of his claims against Rocky Mountain came before the District Court on his motion to strike Rocky Mountain's notice of joinder in White River's motion to compel arbitration and dismiss. White River made the motion pursuant to M. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1), and \u00a7 27-5-115, MCA. Unless it considers extrinsic facts pursuant to M. R. Civ. P. 56 or upon supplemental evidentiary hearing pursuant to \u00a7 27-5-115, MCA, a district court considering\n   a motion to dismiss and compel arbitration pursuant to M. R. Civ. P. 12(b) and \u00a7 27-5-115, MCA, must take all well-pled factual allegations set forth in the complaint as true.\n   <em>\n    Kortum-Managhan v.

Peeler's complaint, as well as his proposed amended complaint, manifestly stated claims against a party (White River) and a non-party (Rocky Mountain) based on allegations that were, as pled, substantially\n   related and interdependent as matters of fact and law. Whether stated jointly against both Defendants in the original complaint, or as separately stated in part but nonetheless factually and legally linked in the proposed amended complaint, Peeler's allegations of related and interdependent misconduct by both parties were intimately founded in or intertwined with the Construction Contract object and duties on the facts and legal theories pled. Under these circumstances, we hold that the District Court did not erroneously fail to conclude that, as a non-party to the agreement, Rocky Mountain lacked standing to enforce the arbitration agreement against Peeler.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   \u00b651 In summary, we hold that the District Court did not erroneously conclude that the arbitration agreement required arbitration of the matters within its scope rather than merely authorizing it as a matter of discretion upon timely demand. We hold that the District Court did not erroneously fail to conclude that the Defendants equitably waived the right to arbitrate. We hold that the District Court did not erroneously compel arbitration without consideration of Peeler's proposed declaratory judgment claim challenging the validity and enforceability of the arbitration agreement. We further hold that the District Court did not erroneously conclude that Peeler's asserted non-contract claims were subject to arbitration. Finally, we hold that the District Court did not erroneously fail to conclude that, as a non-party to the agreement, Rocky Mountain lacked standing to enforce the arbitration agreement against Peeler.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   \u00b652 Affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   We concur:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   JAMES JEREMIAH SHEA, J.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   INGRID GUSTAFSON, J.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   BETH BAKER, J.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   LAURIE McKINNON, J.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-87\">\n    Contrary to the contemplation in the Design Contract, Peeler and Rocky Mountain did not ultimately enter into a separate contract for the manufacture and delivery of the necessary log package.
