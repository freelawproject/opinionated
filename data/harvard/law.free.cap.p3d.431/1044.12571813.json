A jury convicted Frederick Kenneth Hill III of domestic violence burglary in the first degree, unlawful imprisonment, and assault in the fourth degree of F.V.-L. Hill seeks reversal, arguing the court erred in admitting text messages as adoptive admissions. Because his response to the text messages does not manifest an adoption or belief in the truth of the accusatory statements, insufficient facts supported admission of the text message exchange. We also conclude the court erred in failing to instruct the jury on whether it could consider the text messages as adoptive admissions. However, because admission of the text messages did not within reasonable probabilities materially affect the outcome of the trial, we affirm the jury convictions. We deny the request to strike the victim penalty assessment or the DNA\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   collection fee, and affirm the judgment and sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   FACTS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 2 Frederick Kenneth Hill III and F.V.-L. were involved in an on-again-off-again romantic relationship. On July 14, 2014, F.V.-L. called 911 to report Hill assaulted her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 3 On August 6, 2015, the State filed an information charging Hill with domestic violence burglary in the first degree and unlawful imprisonment of F.V.-L. on July 14, 2014. Hill pleaded not guilty. On March 16, 2016, the State filed an amended information that also charges Hill with domestic violence felony harassment and assault in the fourth degree of F.V.-L. Hill pleaded not guilty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 4 The State filed a pretrial motion to admit a transcript of a text message exchange F.V.-L. initiated with Hill on April 1, 2015. During the text message exchange, F.V.-L. makes accusatory statements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 5 The prosecutor argued the text messages were admissible as adopted admissions under ER 801 (d)(2)(ii). The prosecutor conceded Hill did not respond directly to the accusatory statements but asserted Hill adopted the statements by silence. The prosecutor argued under the circumstances, the court should conclude Hill would have responded if the accusatory statements were not true.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   Your Honor, as the court well knows, there's this idea in hearsay case law where you can adopt a statement by your silence. And so, what we have here are text messages by the complaining witness to Mr. Hill saying, \"The last time we hung out, you pulled my hair and I wet my pants,\" which is basically what the allegations are in this case. And, Mr. Hill responds to that by not even responding to the allegation. He says something like, \"Oh, we should be an adult about this,\" and etcetera, etcetera. And he never responds to the allegations. So, the question is, there's basically a two-part test. Did the person actually hear the statement in question, understood it, and was able to respond? And was the statement made under such circumstances that you would expect the person to reasonably deny the allegation if the allegation were untrue? ... He responds immediately. ... And instead of denying it, he just changes the subject. And this is under circumstances where you would expect a person to actually deny it because they're having an argument in this exchange of text messages and the defendant is accusing her of\n   different things and denying doing certain things. So, if he were going to deny it, you would expect him to deny assaulting her at this time and he doesn't.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 6 Defense counsel argued the text messages were inadmissible out-of-court hearsay statements, not adoptive admissions, because Hill responded but did not acquiesce or manifest a belief in the truth of the accusatory statements.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   I am a bit bewildered by the State's recitation just now. Mr. Hill in fact does respond and says, \"Let's be adults.\" That's his response. ... He doesn't have to acquiesce to her level and directly respond to her allegations. So, to say that he's silent as to her comments about him pulling her hair and making her pee on herself is completely ludicrous. ... He has no obligation to directly respond to that, and his response is \"Let's be adults about this.\" He does respond. He has no obligation under case law, under any law, to directly point by point respond to her, and the response he does make is completely appropriate by saying, \"Let's be adults about this.\" The statement does not fall under any exception to the hearsay rule. It's a prior out-of-court statement. It's wholly inconsistent to prior statements she has made to the police about what happened at the time of this incident. She makes this text to Mr. Hill about a year after the incident, which is completely different from what she said to the police at the time of the incident in a written statement. And it's her attempt and the State's attempt to recharacterize the nature of this incident. That's all it is. But in any event, it does not fall under any exception to the hearsay rule, it's an out-of-court statement. Mr. Hill did not acquiesce or in any way accede to her comments by remaining silent.... The statement is hearsay and should not be allowed in.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The court reserved ruling on the motion to admit the text messages as adoptive admissions pending the pretrial hearing on authentication of the text messages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 7 F.V.-L. testified at the pretrial hearing. F.V.-L. identified the April 1, 2015 text message exchange, her cell phone number, and Hill's cell phone number. F.V.-L. said she sent the first text message to Hill at around 10:49 p.m. and he responded \"right away.\" F.V.-L. testified that Hill \"always told me to act like an adult.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 8 The prosecutor argued that under\n   <em>\n    State v. Neslund\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1706449\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-app/50/531/\">\n    50 Wash. App. 531\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=749%20P.2d%20725\">\n    749 P.2d 725\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1988), Hill adopted the accusatory statements by silence because he had the opportunity to deny the statements. \"[G]iven his silence in the face of these allegations, it is an adoption by silence and it is not hearsay.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 9 The defense attorney argued that unlike in\n   <em>\n    Neslund\n   </em>\n   , Hill responded and did not manifest adoption or acquiescence in the accusatory statements.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   Even [F.V.-L.], when she testified that, \"Mr. Hill always tells me to be an adult.\" That was a pretty salient statement by her. \"That's how he always responds to me,\" and that's what he responded in the text messages when he said to her, you know, \"Last time we spoke, you pulled my hair and I peed on myself.\" The standard response to me is, you know, \"We agreed to be adults.\" She said he always says that to her. It's not silence, it's not acquiesce, it's just the way he communicates with her. ... That's how they communicate. ... She initiated the contact with Mr. Hill. Mr. Hill, in his typical way, as she put it, said, \"Be an adult about it.\" And they went on to talk about his affairs with women, which is what she really initiated the conversation to be about, and then they went from there. She never returned to the topic about the hair pulling or anything like that to draw him back in. So, again, it's not a situation where she's making accusations and he just completely ignores it over and over again. She throws the opening salvo, he responds with his typical response, and then they go from their conversations in their typical fashion to talking about his past affairs. There's nothing in those text messages to suggest that he was admitting to pulling her hair or acquiescing to her claim that he indeed had pulled her hair. He was just resorting to his typical language, which she admitted as how he communicates with her.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 10 Defense counsel also pointed out the difference in communicating by text message:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   And again, as I indicated in my brief, this is communication by text. This is not two people having a conversation with each other in person, which may be completely different from how we communicate by text. It's much more truncated, it's much more succinct. People don't have a full open conversation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b6 11 Defense counsel argued the court should \"find that there was no adoption by silence or acquiescence and deny the admission of the text messages. One, because they're hearsay, and two, that it doesn't meet the threshold of an adoptive admission.\" The court ruled the text messages were admissible as adoptive admissions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b6 12 King County Sheriff Sergeant Randall Potter, F.V.-L., and her son J.V. testified at trial on behalf of the State. The court admitted a number of exhibits into evidence, including photographs of F.V.-L.'s injuries and a transcript of the April 1, 2015 text message exchange.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b6 13 F.V.-L. testified that a couple months after she and Hill began dating in 2006, they argued about whether to drive \" 'to downtown Seattle.' \" When F.V.-L. told Hill she did not want to go downtown, Hill\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   pulled the car to the side and he's like, \"Bitch, don't play with me. We're gonna go.\" And then he grabbed his hand and put it on my neck. And I was - he said, \"We're gonna go.\" And so, then he started the car back again and he took me to downtown.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   F.V.-L. said Hill apologized the next day. F.V.-L. \"didn't see him for a couple of months.\" But after Hill brought her \"flowers and cards\" and said he would \" 'never do it again,' \" they got back together.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b6 14 F.V.-L. testified that one night in 2008, Hill called from \"some bar really drunk\" and said he needed a ride home. After F.V.-L. picked him up, Hill insisted on going home with her. When F.V.-L. told him no, Hill \"started screaming at me, telling me, 'Bitch, you're gonna take me to your house. If you're my woman, you're gonna take me to your house.' \" F.V.-L. stopped at a parking lot. F.V.-L. testified that \"when we were sitting in the car, he grabbed me by my hair and was pulling my hair towards the steering wheel a couple of times.\" F.V.-L. said she told him, \" 'I don't want to be with you. I think you're crazy.' \" According to F.V.-L., Hill said, \" 'Bitch, you're gonna be with me if you like it or not, and you're gonna take me to your house.' \" F.V.-L. \"got out of the car\" and called 911. The State charged Hill with malicious mischief and assault in the fourth degree. F.V.-L. did not testify. A jury found Hill not guilty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b6 15 F.V.-L. testified that after 2008, she \"didn't see\" Hill again until 2014. In 2014, F.V.-L. lived in her house in Federal Way with her teenage son J.V. F.V.-L. said Hill \"would come and put flowers on my porch and cards\" and told her he was \" 'changing [his] life.' \" F.V.-L. and Hill got back together. Hill spent the night at her house at least \"two or three times a week.\" F.V.-L. testified Hill did not have a key and \"would always call ... before coming to the house.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b6 16 On Sunday, July 13, F.V.-L. and Hill spent the night together. The next morning, F.V.-L. wished him a happy birthday before she left to go to work. F.V.-L. planned to take Hill out to dinner that night to celebrate his 47th birthday. Later that day, Hill called F.V.-L. at work to tell her he was with his daughter and the mother of his daughter celebrating his birthday. F.V.-L. was \"annoyed.\" F.V.-L. told Hill she \"didn't really want him around me if he's been drinking.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b6 17 J.V. called F.V.-L. at work to tell her he planned to stay overnight with his father. F.V.-L. told J.V. she planned to visit her aunt after work then take her dog for a walk. F.V.-L. asked J.V. to \" 'make sure you lock' \" up the house.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b6 18 F.V.-L. said the front door was locked when she arrived home after work at around 4:00 p.m. F.V.-L. got the dog and locked the front door. After she visited her aunt, F.V.-L. took the dog for a walk at Alki and left her cell phone in the car. When F.V.-L. returned to her car, she saw that Hill \"kept calling\" her and leaving voicemails on her cell phone. F.V.-L. testified Hill \"was just like, 'Where you at? I'm here outside your house. ...'\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   You know, 'Why would you do this to me on my birthday' \"? F.V.-L. decided to wait until the next day to call him back.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b6 19 F.V.-L. returned home between 8:30 and 9:00 p.m. F.V.-L. testified that when she unlocked the front door, she saw Hill standing behind the door. F.V.-L. asked, \" 'What are you doing here? How did you get in' \"? Because Hill \"looked really angry,\" F.V.-L. said she turned to run \"towards the front yard.\" F.V.-L. testified Hill \"grabbed me by my shoulder and by my hair, and then he took me inside the house, and then he just threw me on the hallway ... and sat me in the middle of the hallway on the steps.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b6 20 F.V.-L. testified that Hill \"kept threatening me. He was like telling me that, 'Bitch, don't play with my emotions. You know that I'm crazy.' \" F.V.-L. said that \"at one point,\" Hill \"wanted to spit on my face. He told me like he wanted to spit so bad at my face, and he had his fist on my nose. He was pressing hard. ... And then he kept telling me that he wanted to knock my teeth out.\" F.V.-L. said, \"I was just so scared ... I peed on myself.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b6 21 F.V.-L. testified that over the course of the next three hours, when she tried to get up, Hill would \"grab my hair and throw me against the floor.\" F.V.-L. said eventually she was able to calm Hill down by telling him, \" 'We'll talk about this tomorrow. ... Let's just go to sleep. ... Go upstairs, take a shower, and then we'll talk about it tomorrow.' \" As soon as Hill got in the shower, she grabbed her dog, her cell phone, and the key to her car and left. F.V.-L. drove to a nearby Lowe's parking lot and called 911.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b6 22 The next day, F.V.-L. noticed \"hand or fingerprints on the side of the wall with oil\" below one of the windows in the dining room. She also noticed \"the screen was missing\" and found it outside \"below the window.\" F.V.-L. said she had bruises on her wrist, arm, and thigh.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b6 23 F.V.-L. obtained a no-contact order against Hill on Thursday on July 17. A victim advocate took photographs of F.V.-L.'s bruises. The court admitted the photographs into evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b6 24 F.V.-L. testified that Hill \"kept calling\" after July 14, 2014 to tell her he was \" 'sorry.' \" F.V.-L. told Hill, \" 'You're gonna pay for this and I'm gonna press charges for what you did.' \"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \u00b6 25 F.V.-L. identified the transcript of the text messages she sent Hill from her cell phone on April 1, 2015. The court admitted a transcript of the text messages between F.V.-L. and Hill into evidence as an exhibit, \"Exhibit 19.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00b6 26 Sergeant Potter testified that he responded to the 911 call at 11:30 p.m. and arrived at the Lowe's parking lot at approximately 12:20 a.m. Sergeant Potter said F.V.-L. was \"upset\" but \"calm.\" Sergeant Potter testified there were tears in F.V.-L.'s eyes and a \"little bit of dry blood around the corner of her lip.\" Sergeant Potter asked F.V.-L. where she was injured. F.V.-L. told Sergeant Potter her neck, back, and her head hurt from \"hair being pulled.\" Sergeant Potter testified F.V.-L. never told him she had urinated on herself while with Hill.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00b6 27 Sergeant Potter took photographs of F.V.-L. Sergeant Potter used a diagram to identify the injuries F.V.-L. reported. The court admitted the photographs and the \"Domestic Violence Supplemental Form\" into evidence. Sergeant Potter testified F.V.-L. gave a statement under penalty of perjury and reviewed and initialed the Domestic Violence Supplemental Form identifying the injuries she reported.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b6 28 J.V. testified that Hill was at the house \"in the morning\" on July 14. J.V. said he planned to spend that night with his father. Before he left, J.V. \"ma[de] sure every single window and every single door in the house was locked, secured.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   \u00b6 29 J.V. testified that when he saw F.V.-L. the next day, she had bruises on her arm and wrist and her voice was \"raspy.\" J.V. noticed the metal frame of the window was \"scuffed up,\" the screen was \"[o]n the floor ... outside,\" the window \"ledges were dirty from the inside especially,\" and there were \"fingermarks\" from \"dirty hands, like grease.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   \u00b6 30 The jury found Hill guilty of burglary in the first degree, unlawful imprisonment,\n   and assault in the fourth degree. The jury found Hill not guilty of felony harassment. By special verdict, the jury found the aggravating factor of domestic violence for the crimes of burglary, unlawful imprisonment, and assault.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <em>\n    Adoptive Admissions\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   \u00b6 31 Hill seeks reversal and a new trial.
