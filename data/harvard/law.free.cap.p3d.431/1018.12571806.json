He began working at Pro-Cut in 1989 when he was 16, soon leaving its employ to attend trade school and participate in a Job Corps program. He resumed working at Pro-Cut when he was 18 or 19 and over time was trained as a slab saw operator. He left Pro-Cut's employ for another job but returned in 2005, at Pro-Cut's invitation. By the time of his return in 2005, Kelly Silvers and his wife had purchased the company.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 6 As a slab saw operator, Mr. Peiffer was required to pick up a company vehicle at Pro-Cut's business location, which he would then drive to his assigned job site. Pursuant to a written travel policy, Pro-Cut's employees were not paid for the first 30 minutes or last 30 minutes of drive time between Pro-Cut's shop and a job site, the company's reasoning being that it could not charge the customer for that time. The policy predated the Silvers' ownership and was in place the entire time Peiffer worked at Pro-Cut.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 7 Mr. Peiffer submitted a time card each week for his hours worked. In 2008, Mr. Peiffer noticed that his time cards, which were reviewed by his supervisor, Monte Sainsbury, were being altered. Times recorded by Mr. Peiffer were sometimes \"whited out\" and new times were written in. Report of Proceedings (RP) at 213. It turned out that when Mr. Sainsbury believed employees had inflated their work time, he would alter their time cards to reflect what he believed was accurate time, including to remove time entered for the first and last half-hour of travel. Mr. Silvers was aware of Mr. Sainsbury's action in changing time cards.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 8 Mr. Peiffer objected to Mr. Sainsbury's alteration of his time cards. On one occasion, his objection led to a physical altercation between the two men. Mr. Peiffer was told that if he did not like the policy, he could quit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 9 Ultimately, Mr. Peiffer did quit. It was on June 8, 2012, after Mr. Sainsbury had again altered Mr. Peiffer's time card. Mr. Peiffer later testified that when he saw how many lines of his time card were whited out \"that was it.\" RP at 221. He refused to return to work unless Pro-Cut paid him the full wages owed him. Mr. Peiffer's last paycheck was in an amount that reflected a reduction of roughly 10 of the hours he had reported. At his prevailing wage at $28.78, that amounted to approximately $300 of withheld wages for the week.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 10 On July 3, 2012, Mr. Peiffer filed a wage complaint with the Department of Labor and Industries, which immediately opened an investigation. The Department's investigation remained open for 14 months during which it never issued a citation or notice of assessment and no administrative action was begun. According to Anna Sanchez, the department investigator assigned to Mr. Peiffer's claim, she was able to determine that \"there were clearly some wage violations\" but his claim was \"extremely difficult.\" RP at 176-77. Mr. Peiffer submitted records of invoices, time cards, and pay stubs to the Department, but he acknowledges that the records he provided were incomplete.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 11 Ms. Sanchez was aware that statutes under which the Department operates contemplate that an investigation will be completed in 60 days. By statute, the Department is required to provide advance written notice if it has good cause for taking longer to complete its investigation, and is required to specify the duration of the extension. During the 14 months the Department's investigation was pending, Ms. Sanchez sent a number of \"60-day letters\" to Mr. Peiffer, indicating that his claim required more time to investigate. RP at 175, 178. She did not send copies of the 60-day letters to Pro-Cut.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 12 When questioned in the trial below, Ms. Sanchez explained that she was the only investigator for Benton, Franklin, Columbia, Walla Walla, and Spokane Counties and given her caseload and the volume of records delivered by Mr. Peiffer, it was difficult to create a calculation of Mr. Peiffer's unpaid wages. She told him several times during the months the investigation was pending that\n   <em>\n    he\n   </em>\n   needed to provide a calculation of his unpaid wages. He responded several times that he had no calculation, and would go along with whatever the Department calculated his unpaid wages to be.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 13 Having reached this impasse, and having waited well over a year for department action on his claim, Mr. Peiffer retained a lawyer, Alicia Berry. She filed suit on his behalf against Pro-Cut, Mr. Silvers, Mr. Sainsbury and the men's wives and marital communities on November 22, 2013. The complaint included nine causes of action. Among them were several causes of action seeking unpaid wages and prejudgment interest. The complaint also included a claim for constructive wrongful termination in violation of public policy. Mr. Peiffer alleged he had been unable to obtain work that paid as well as his former work as a slab saw operator, and he sought to recover back pay and front pay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 14 Upon learning of Mr. Peiffer's lawsuit from Ms. Berry a few days after it was filed, Ms. Sanchez wrote what she described as a \"closure letter\" to Mr. Peiffer dated November 27, 2013. Although the letter is not in our record on appeal, she evidently stated that in light of his lawsuit she was terminating her investigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b6 15 The lawsuit filed by Ms. Berry put Pro-Cut on notice for the first time that Mr. Peiffer had filed a wage complaint with the Department.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b6 16 After suit was filed, the jointly-represented defendants delivered a series of what their lawyer described as \"stipulation[s] as to the amount owing\" in an effort to avoid liability for Mr. Peiffer's reasonable attorney fees under RCW 49.48.030.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Clerk's Papers (CP) at 46. In the final stipulation the defendants filed before trial, they admitted to wages owed of $31,631.69. As explained by the defendants' lawyer, this was based on a letter from Ms. Berry dated May 3, 2016, that provided her calculation of the wages owed, although the defendants then adjusted Ms. Berry's calculation downward. Ms. Berry's calculation included unpaid wages owed beginning in June 2009, based on Mr. Peiffer's position that the statute of limitations on his wage claim was tolled during the Department's investigation. The defendants reduced Ms. Berry's calculation based on their position\n   that the statute of limitations was not tolled. They limited the amount of their admitted liability to unpaid wages owed beginning in November 2010.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b6 17 The lawsuit proceeded to a bench trial. In addition to presenting evidence of the amount of unpaid wages, prejudgment interest, and reduced earnings, Mr. Peiffer presented evidence that he and his wife would pay additional federal income tax as a result of receiving his unpaid wages in a lump sum. The defendants presented no evidence on the tax issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b6 18 After Mr. Peiffer rested his case, the defendants moved the court for involuntary dismissal of a number of his claims under CR 41(b)(3). The trial court did not rule on the motion immediately, wanting to receive responsive briefing. When the motion was brought up the next day, the trial court stated that it would address the CR 41(b)(3) motion in closing and was \"going to make [its] ruling all in one.\" RP at 262.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b6 19 At the conclusion of the bench trial, the court dismissed the claims against the Sainsburys and otherwise ruled as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   \u2022 It determined that by filing a claim with the Department, the statute of limitations on Mr. Peiffer's claim was tolled and it awarded Mr. Peiffer withheld wages in the amount of $42,768.12;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   \u2022 It awarded Mr. Peiffer prejudgment interest of $28,491.40;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   \u2022 It awarded Mr. Peiffer the amount of $8,784.00 to offset his increased tax liability on account of receiving his unpaid wages in a lump sum;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   \u2022 It determined that Pro-Cut and the Silvers had been willful in withholding wages but that Mr. Peiffer knowingly submitted to the withholding, so it denied Mr. Peiffer's request for an award of double damages under RCW 49.52.070 ;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   \u2022 It found that Mr. Peiffer was entitled to an award of his reasonable attorney fees and costs under RCW 49.48.030, having recovered more in wages than Pro-Cut had admitted was due; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   \u2022 It granted the defendants' CR 41(b)(3) motion for dismissal of Mr. Peiffer's claims for breach of contract, violation of the Consumer Protection Act, chapter 19.86 RCW, and constructive wrongful termination.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b6 20 The amount of reasonable attorney fees and costs to be awarded Mr. Peiffer was argued thereafter. Ms. Berry and her co-counsel, Brian Davis, submitted a declaration and affidavit, respectively, with attached time records, documenting a lodestar fee measure of $73,395.50. They had represented Mr. Peiffer under a contingent fee agreement and sought a multiplier based on risk associated with taking the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b6 21 Mr. Peiffer sought $9,778.82 in costs, some of which were for reimbursement of Ms. Berry's costs of traveling to Washington State for the trial. After taking the case while resident in Washington, Ms. Berry and her family moved to the east coast. While she associated Mr. Davis to handle pretrial court appearances, she traveled to Washington State for trial, including on one occasion when the case was set for trial but was bumped by other cases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b6 22 Although the court made three findings that courts sometimes view as supporting a multiplier, the trial court awarded attorney fees to Mr. Peiffer in the rounded amount of $50,000.00 without an explanation for the reduction from the lodestar figure other than that $50,000.00 was \"a reasonable amount.\" RP at 314. In its written findings, the court described its award as the \"reasonable and necessary\" amount. CP at 127. It awarded $5,503.13 in costs. The cost amount was also unexplained, although it is pointed out on appeal that the amount can be arrived at by subtracting Ms. Berry's travel costs from Mr. Peiffer's requested costs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b6 23 Pro-Cut appeals. Mr. Peiffer cross appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <em>\n    Appeal\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \u00b6 24 Pro-Cut\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   makes three assignments of error on appeal. It contends the trial court\n   erred (1) in determining that Mr. Peiffer's wage claim was tolled during the Department's investigation, (2) in awarding Mr. Peiffer attorney fees and costs, and (3) in awarding damages to compensate for an increased tax liability. We address the claimed errors in the order stated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   I.

RCW 49.48.083(1). It \"shall issue either a citation and notice of assessment or a determination of compliance\" unless the wage complaint is \"otherwise resolved.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=991%20P.2d%201126\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   If the Department finds a violation, it issues a citation and notice of assessment that is served on the employer and employee.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .

RCW 49.48.084(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   \u00b6 27 Having issued the citation and notice of assessment, the Department may order the employer to pay the complaining employee all wages owed for the three years preceding the filing of the wage complaint, including interest of one percent per month on the wages owed. RCW 49.48.083(2). Payment by the employer and acceptance by the employee of the wages and interest assessed by the Department bars the employee from initiating and pursuing any court action based on the wage payment requirements addressed in the citation and notice of assessment.

The statute goes on to provide in its subsection (3)(a) that \"[n]othing in this section shall be construed to limit or affect ...

Applying the plain meaning of the first sentence of RCW 49.48.083(5), the applicable statute of limitations for civil actions was tolled during that time. Pro-Cut argues that the more particular identification of the beginning and end dates of the tolling period leads to a different result, however.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   \u00b6 33 The parties agree that the Department's investigation began on July 3, 2012. They agree that the subparagraph (a) end date of the tolling period does not apply, because Mr. Peiffer's wage complaint was never finally determined through a final and binding citation and notice of assessment or determination of compliance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   \u00b6 34 They agree that one of the subparagraph (b) end dates-\"that the employee has elected to terminate the Department's administrative action under RCW 49.48.085\"-does not apply, because the 10-day postcitation right to terminate the Department's investigation never arose and could never have been exercised by Mr. Peiffer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   \u00b6 35 That leaves the parties with three theories of how RCW 48.49.083(5) applies on these facts. Mr. Peiffer advances two arguments. One is that the remaining subparagraph (b) end date applies because Ms. Sanchez's November 27 closing letter \"notifie[d] the employer and the employee in writing that the wage complaint has been otherwise resolved.\" There are two problems with this argument. One is that the wage complaint had not been \"resolved\" in the commonly-understood meaning of that word.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The second is that the Department did not notify \"\n   <em>\n    the employer\n   </em>\n   and employee in writing,\" since its closing letter was sent only to Mr. Peiffer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   \u00b6 36 Mr. Peiffer's second argument is that according to the plain language of RCW 49.48.083(5), nothing happened to make the tolling period end, meaning that tolling applies. Pro-Cut agrees that under the plain language of the provision nothing happened to make the tolling period end. But it argues,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   [T]he question becomes, what did the legislature intend if the \"end\" of the tolling period is never triggered?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   In its wisdom, the legislature designed the specificities of the tolling statute with the purpose of encouraging employees to see the Department's investigation through to the end. Otherwise, employees could simply initiate the Department's investigation, fail to meaningfully assist in the investigation, thereby artificially tolling the statute of limitations indefinitely. This result encourages employees to abuse the resources of the Department to their own strategic advantage, and deprives employers of the finality of a Department decision they can act upon to remedy their mistake.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Appellants/Cross-Resp't's Opening Br. at 12. \"[B]ecause he did not allow the Department to reach a conclusion,\" Pro-Cut contends, \"Mr. Peiffer cannot ... take advantage of the tolling of the statute of limitations.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13. Unfortunately for Pro-Cut, statutory language does not support its theory about the legislature's intent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   \u00b6 37 We begin with Pro-Cut's textual arguments. Its primary reliance is on RCW 49.48.085(1), which states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   An employee who has filed a wage complaint with the department may elect to terminate the department's administrative action, thereby preserving any private right of action, by providing written notice to the department within ten business days\n   after the employee's receipt of the department's citation and notice of assessment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Pro-Cut sometimes treats the language \"thereby preserving\n   <em>\n    any private right of action\n   </em>\n   \" as if it said \"thereby preserving\n   <em>\n    the benefit of tolling\n   </em>\n   ,\" which is plainly not what it says. The provision does not speak to tolling at all.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   \u00b6 38 Pro-Cut treats the language about electing to \"terminate the\n   <em>\n    department's administrative action\n   </em>\n   \" as if it said \"terminate the\n   <em>\n    employee's exclusive reliance on an administrative remedy\n   </em>\n   ,\" but here again, that is plainly not what is said. RCW 49.48.085(1) identifies the only circumstance in chapter 49.48 RCW under which an employee can stop an investigation that the Department is otherwise obliged to pursue.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   It says nothing about whether an employee can bring a civil action and allow the department investigation to proceed. Even a federal case cited by Pro-Cut,\n   <em>\n    Jama v.

State law authorizes employees to file a wage complaint with Labor &amp; Industries [DLI] regarding any wage violations that occurred within the past three years. RCW 49.48.083(1).

Pro-Cut relies on the ultimately codified language that the employee may elect to terminate the Department's investigation by providing notice \"\n   <em>\n    within ten business days after\n   </em>\n   \" receipt of the citation and notice of assessment-language that originally read \"\n   <em>\n    within five business days of\n   </em>\n   \" receipt of the citation and notice of assessment.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   SUBSTITUTE H.B. 3185, \u00a7 4, at 5, 59th Leg., Reg. Sess. (Wash. 2006),\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   H.B. 3185, \u00a7 4, at 4, 59th Leg., Reg. Sess. (Wash. 2006). Pro-Cut contends that use of the word \"after\" \"ensure[s]\" that the Department must complete its investigation for the tolling provision to apply. Appellants/Cross-Resp't's Opening Br. at 14. But nowhere in RCW 49.48.085 is there any reference to \"toll,\" \"tolling,\" or even to \" RCW 49.48.083.\" The language on which Pro-Cut relies simply has nothing to\n   do with tolling.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   \u00b6 40 We turn to Pro-Cut's non-textual argument that the legislature's objective was to \"encourage[ ] employees to see the Department's investigation through to the end\"-an objective it argues is advanced by making tolling available to only those employees who wait for the Department to complete its investigation before electing to file a lawsuit. Pro-Cut argues that employees who do not wait \"abuse the resources of the Department.\" Appellants/Cross-Resp't's Opening Br. at 12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   \u00b6 41 Such employees \"use\" resources of the Department, but Pro-Cut does not explain how they \"abuse\" them. The legislature has charged the Department with investigating wage complaints. The objective is to assist employees whose wages have not been paid by an employer. If a wage complainant decides during a department investigation that retaining a lawyer and pursuing a claim in court will be faster or more likely to succeed, the decision both advances the interest of the employee and frees up department resources to assist others. Pro-Cut's vision of a legislature that intends the Department to maintain a jealous grip on complaints it cannot timely resolve is unpersuasive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   \u00b6 42 We also reject Pro-Cut's argument that permitting an employee to file a wage complaint with the Department and then shift to litigation \"artificially\" tolls the statute of limitations \"indefinitely,\" to the employee's own \"strategic advantage.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%204758722\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The tolling will not be indefinite. It will not even be protracted if the Department completes its investigation within the 60 days contemplated by the legislature. And we do not view the employee as gaining a \"strategic advantage\" if tolling locks in the employee's ability to collect all wages earned but unpaid during the prior three years. Going on record with a formal claim in a proper forum is a\n   <em>\n    typical\n   </em>\n   way to lock in the ability to collect damages that accrued during a limitations period.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   \u00b6 43 Our only agreement with Pro-Cut on this issue is that it was disadvantaged by being unaware of Mr. Peiffer's wage complaint earlier. Upon learning of the wage complaint, Pro-Cut quickly realized that it should admit the amount of wages owed in order to avoid liability for attorney fees. But the lack of notice to Pro-Cut was the fault of the Department, not Mr. Peiffer. Pro-Cut should have received the first 60-day letter that Ms. Sanchez sent to Mr. Peiffer, whether or not she had communicated with Pro-Cut earlier. RCW 49.48.083(1) provides that if the Department is unable to complete its investigation within 60 days of receiving a wage complaint, it \"may extend the time period by providing advance written notice to the employee\n   <em>\n    and the employer\n   </em>\n   setting forth good cause for an extension of the time period and specifying the duration of the extension.\" (Emphasis added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   \u00b6 44 We are not at all sympathetic to Pro-Cut's complaint that it incurred the cost of additional prejudgment interest because of the time it took Ms. Berry to deliver a final calculation of Mr. Peiffer's wages. The difficulty in accounting for the unpaid wages was entirely attributable to Pro-Cut's practice of altering time cards and failing to keep a record of the amount of time originally reported by the employee.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   The duty to keep accurate time records is the employer's, not\n   the employee's. WAC 296-128-010. If Pro-Cut wanted a quicker calculation, it could have engaged in any needed discovery and worked on preparing one itself.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   \u00b6 45 If an employee files a wage complaint with the Department and then files a civil action while the investigation is pending, RCW 49.48.083(5), reasonably construed, tolls the statute of limitations until the Department resolves the complaint or the civil action is completed, at which point the Department can send notice that the matter has been \"otherwise resolved.\" The trial court correctly ruled that the tolling provision applied to Mr. Peiffer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   II. HAVING DETERMINED THAT THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS WAS TOLLED, MR. PEIFFER WAS ENTITLED TO AN AWARD OF REASONABLE ATTORNEY FEES AND COSTS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   \u00b6 46 Washington statutes authorize trial courts to award attorney fees to successful wage claimants, but RCW 49.48.030 takes that authority away \"if the amount of recovery is less than or equal to the amount admitted by the employer to be owing for said wages or salary.\" Pro-Cut's assignment of error to the attorney fees and costs awarded to Mr. Peiffer depended on successfully arguing that his claim was not tolled during the Department's investigation, in which case his recovery would have been equal to the amount Pro-Cut admitted was owing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   \u00b6 47 Because the statute\n   <em>\n    was\n   </em>\n   tolled, Mr. Peiffer was entitled to recovery of unpaid wages going back to July 2009, an amount that exceeded the amount admitted by Pro-Cut to be owing. There was no error in concluding that Mr. Peiffer was entitled to recover reasonable attorney fees and costs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   III. THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN CONCLUDING THAT MR. PEIFFER WAS ENTITLED TO RECOVER AN AMOUNT EQUAL TO HIS INCREASED TAX LIABILITY ARISING FROM THE LUMP SUM PAYMENT OF HIS PREVIOUSLY UNPAID WAGES\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   \u00b6 48 Pro-Cut argues the trial court erred in awarding Mr. Peiffer $8,784 to offset tax consequences because the trial court had no statutory authority to make the award. We agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   \u00b6 49 In\n   <em>\n    Blaney v.

Mr. Peiffer refused to return to work until Pro-Cut paid him the full wages owed to him for the time period.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   CP at 124. Based on its findings, the trial court concluded that Pro-Cut willfully withheld Mr. Peiffer's unpaid wages. But it also concluded that Mr. Peiffer knowingly submitted to the withholding of his wages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   \u00b6 73 Mr. Peiffer contends the trial court's conclusion that he knowingly submitted to Pro-Cut's violations is not supported by its findings.

At that point, the employee will know the amount of unpaid wages the Department is willing to fight for. With the citation and notice of assessment, things will start happening quickly. An employer who realizes there has been a violation might want to pay within 10 days to be entitled to a penalty waiver and avoid additional prejudgment interest.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    RCW 49.48.083(2), (3)(c).

The Washington Supreme Court's recent\n    <em>\n     Martin\n    </em>\n    decision holds that the after-acquired-evidence doctrine does not apply to wrongful discharge claims, meaning that an employer's overriding justification is irrelevant unless it motivated a firing.
