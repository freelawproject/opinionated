The first is whether a United States Postal Service (USPS) inspector seized a package in violation of the Oregon Constitution when she took the package out of a mail hamper and put it on the floor so that a drug-detection dog could sniff it. The second is whether another postal inspector seized the package when, after the dog had alerted to the package, he took it to the addressee's house and asked for consent to search it. Focusing on the first issue, the trial court ruled that no seizure had occurred because defendants had no constitutionally protected possessory interest in the package while it was in the mail. The Court of Appeals reversed, reasoning that defendants had a constitutionally protected property interest in the package, which the first postal inspector significantly interfered with when she took the package out of the mail hamper.\n   <em>\n    State v.

We allowed the state's petitions for review and now reverse the Court of\n   Appeals decisions and affirm the trial court's judgments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   These consolidated cases involve two defendants, Sholedice and Smith. On May 27, 2014, Sholedice mailed a package from Las Cruces, New Mexico, to Smith in Lincoln City, Oregon. He paid the USPS approximately $63 to mail the package by express mail with a guaranteed delivery date of May 29, 2014. The label on the package was handwritten, addressed to \"M. Smith\" in Lincoln City, and contained a signature waiver, which meant that the package could be left at the address without the addressee signing for it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Craig is a federal postal inspector who works at a mail processing facility near the Portland airport. Hampers full of mail come into the processing facility each day, filled with packages destined for various locations throughout Oregon. Pursuant to federal policies, Craig sorts through the hampers looking for prohibited mail-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , mail that contains poison, controlled substances, suspicious powders, bombs, and \"injurious objects,\" such as knives, guns, poisonous insects, and snakes. As she explained and the trial\n   court found, she looks for packages containing prohibited mail \"to keep our-our carriers safe.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The USPS has established protocols for determining which packages may contain prohibited materials, and Craig sorted packages based on those protocols. On the morning of May 28, Craig came across Sholedice's package. She noticed that four indicators set out in the USPS protocols were present. First, Sholedice's use of express mail was unusual. Express mail is ordinarily used by businesses; it is not typically used for mailing packages from one person to another. Second, Sholedice paid more than was necessary to send the package. He paid approximately $63 to mail the package from New Mexico to Oregon by express mail when first-class or priority mail could have gotten the package to Oregon in the same amount of time at a fraction of the cost.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Third, the label included a signature waiver. Craig testified that most senders use express mail to ensure that the letter or package has been received by having the addressee sign for it. She explained that a sender may waive the signature requirement either because \"they don't want [the mail carrier] to have a face to face with [the addressee]\" or because they do not want the addressee to know that the package has arrived.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Finally, Craig testified that senders who use express mail ordinarily use the addressee's full name rather than an initial and last name, such as \"M. Smith.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Not only did Sholedice's package stand out for those reasons, but Craig also knew that Oregon is a source state for exporting marijuana and a destination state for receipt of drug proceeds. For those reasons, she took the package out of the hamper and put it on the floor of the sorting\n   facility along with six other similarly-sized packages, which Craig also took out of the mail, so that Nikko, a trained drug-detection dog, could sniff them. Nikko and his handler did not take part in sorting the packages or in selecting which packages would be put in the \"package lineup,\" nor were they aware of which package had aroused Craig's suspicions. Their role was limited to determining if any packages contained drugs. As the handler testified, the USPS does not have \"K-9s, and so they ask mostly local agencies to provide that tool for them to screen mail.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Nikko sniffed the seven packages and alerted on the package that Sholedice had sent Smith. At the suppression hearing, Nikko's handler explained that Nikko has been certified every six months to detect four drugs: methamphetamine, marijuana, cocaine, and heroin. He testified that, during 4,000 training and certification searches, Nikko has alerted incorrectly only eight times. After Nikko alerted on defendants' package, a person checked the address in Lincoln City and found that it was listed on a registry for medical marijuana grows.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Later, at the suppression hearing, Craig was asked a hypothetical question. She was asked on cross-examination what she would have done if Nikko had not alerted on the package. She testified that the package would not have continued \"in the normal course of the mail.\" Rather, she \"would have done a further investigation on it.\" When asked on redirect what she meant by \"further investigation,\" Craig explained that \"we would try to-try to get ahold of M. Smith or Nathan * * * Sholedice\" and \"talk to them a little bit about the parcel to get some more information.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Craig was not able to take the package to Lincoln City. She accordingly asked another federal postal inspector, Helton, to deliver the package. Helton testified that, although he does not ordinarily deliver mail, he is authorized, as a postal inspector, to do so. On the way to Lincoln\n   City, Helton contacted a Lincoln City detective to serve as a backup. When Helton delivered the package, both he and the detective were wearing plain clothes. Neither displayed a weapon. No patrol car was parked in view of the house. When they arrived at the address in Lincoln City, Helton walked up to the front door. As he did so, he noticed \"the distinct and pungent smell\" of marijuana.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   When he knocked, Michelle Smith came to the door and stepped outside the house. Helton spoke with her briefly. He told her that he was a federal postal inspector and that his job was to investigate illegal activity with the United States Postal Service. He asked her if she were expecting an express mail package, and she said that she was. He then asked \"if Nathan [Sholedice] was at home,\" and she said that he was.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   He told her that he was going to be \"upfront\" with her, that he believed that the parcel contained either controlled substances or money, and he \"asked for her permission to open the parcel and to examine the contents of the parcel.\" She replied, \"Yeah.\" Helton asked if there was money in the parcel, and Smith \"nodded her head affirmatively, yes.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Helton then asked to speak with Sholedice. Smith asked Sholedice to come out of the house, and Helton spoke with him separately. Helton told Sholedice that he was a federal postal inspector and that he believed that the package contained contraband or money. He then asked Sholedice for his consent to open the package. Sholedice replied, \"Yeah, you can open it if you need to.\" When Sholedice said that, Helton told Sholedice that he \"was asking for his permission to open the parcel and search the contents and that I would not open the parcel if he told me that I could not open it.\" Sholedice responded, \"You're going to open it up eventually anyway. Go ahead.\" Given that response, Helton opened the package, where he found $15,240 vacuum wrapped in\n   plastic, which in turn was wrapped with duct tape. The money was further wrapped inside clothing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Helton explained that, throughout their conversation, Smith and Sholedice were pleasant. He described them as \"calm, *** not particularly upset or angry,\" and he thanked them for being reasonable under the circumstances. Based on what he found in the parcel and defendants' answers concerning their medical marijuana grow, Helton asked Smith and Sholedice for consent to search their house. Both Smith and Sholedice said \"no,\" and Helton responded that he \"totally understood, [and] that [he] respected\n   their decision to deny consent.\" At that point, the Lincoln City detective left to apply for a state warrant to search the home.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Later, at the suppression hearing, defendants also asked Helton a hypothetical question: If Sholedice had asked Helton to return the package to him when they first spoke-namely, after Helton knew that Nikko had alerted to the package and that the address in Lincoln City was registered as a medical marijuana grow but before Smith had consented to a search-would Helton have done so? Helton answered \"no.\" He provided a similar answer when asked whether he would have delivered the package to Smith without further investigation. He added that, \"[i]f the contents of the parcel would have been found to be innocuous and there was a reasonable explanation for the contents of the parcel, [he] would've delivered the parcel to Ms. Smith, as [he] ha[s] done on other occasions.\" However, Helton testified that he had reason to believe that the package contained either illegal drugs or drug proceeds before speaking with Smith and Sholedice and for that reason would not have delivered the package unopened.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Following the search of the package, the state charged Sholedice and Smith with unlawfully delivering marijuana for consideration in violation of\n   <em>\n    former\n   </em>\n   ORS 475.860(2) (2013),\n   <em>\n    repealed by\n   </em>\n   Or. Laws 2017, ch. 21, \u00a7 126. Before trial, both defendants filed motions to suppress the evidence that Helton had discovered as a result of the search of the package. They argued that Craig unlawfully seized the package when she took it from the hamper and put it\n   in the package lineup for Nikko to sniff, and they sought to suppress the evidence resulting from that seizure. The trial court disagreed, explaining that neither Sholedice nor Smith had a protected possessory interest in the package with which Craig or Helton interfered.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In analyzing that issue, the trial court focused initially on Craig's actions in taking the package out of the mail hamper and putting it in the package lineup. The trial court reasoned that, once Sholedice put the package in the mail, neither Sholedice nor Smith had \"a possessory interest in the package as long as it's still within the [guaranteed delivery time].\" The court reasoned:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   \"[T]here was testimony during this proceeding by both employees of the post office, that the mailing of contraband does put postal deliveries or postal employees at risk.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   \"They have a-there's a reason, if you will, that they engage in this screening-screening of packages for contraband.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   \"And what they have developed is what the Court would describe as a minimal intrusion on the packages that are going through the transit facility, subjecting them to a-a sniff.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   \"I agree that the postal inspectors both identified or testified that this package, once it was identified as suspicious, was not going to be returned to the normal stream of mail.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   \"That if the dog had not alerted or no alert, there would have been further investigation. The dog-however, the dog, in fact, did alert. What happened at that point is rather than obtain a warrant, the-and the package was not further opened or inspected-the package was just then given to law enforcement who drove it down to Lincoln City.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   As we read the trial court's factual findings, the court found, consistently with Craig's testimony, that Craig removed the package from the mail hamper because she\n   suspected that it contained \"nonmailable\" material, and her \"reason\" for looking for packages containing contraband and other nonmailable material was to keep from putting postal employees at risk.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   The trial court\n   also found that, once Craig identified the package as suspicious, the package \"was not going to be returned to the normal stream of mail\" and that, \"if the dog had not alerted *** there would have been further investigation.\" As the trial court observed, however, \"the dog, in fact, did alert\" and, as a result, Craig gave the package to Helton to deliver to Lincoln City.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Because the trial court found that defendants had no constitutionally protected possessory interest in the package, the court recognized that it did not need to decide whether Nikko's alert established probable cause or whether a federal warrant could have been obtained before the guaranteed delivery time. The court, however, accepted the dog handler's testimony that Nikko's training and experience met the \"standards as they're set forth in-[\n   <em>\n    State v.\n   </em>\n   ]\n   <em>\n    Foster\n   </em>\n   ,\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3674557\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/350/161/\">\n    350 Or. 161\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3674557\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/350/161/\">\n    252 P.3d 292\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2011), for determining when a trained drug dog's alert establishes probable cause. Finally, the trial court noted, with apparent agreement, that \"the State pointed out in their argument that had the State gone through the efforts to obtain a [federal] warrant [to search the United States mail], since a telephonic [warrant] is not available [in federal court], that it actually would have resulted in a more significant intrusion [than having Helton ask for consent] because the package would not have been delivered on time.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Having made those findings, the trial court denied defendants' motions to suppress. Afterwards, both defendants entered conditional guilty pleas.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Each defendant appealed separately, and the Court of Appeals reversed in both cases.\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   , 283 Or.

In this case, defendants do not argue that Nikko's sniff of the package constituted a \"search\" for the purposes of Article I, section 9. Rather, they argue that Craig seized the package when she took it out of the mail hamper and put on the floor for Nikko to sniff. Additionally, they argue that Helton seized the package when he asked Smith and then Sholedice for consent to search the package.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   We begin with the question whether Craig seized the package when she put it on the floor for Nikko to sniff. On that question, defendants identify two ways in which Craig's actions significantly interfered with their possessory interest in the package and thus constituted a seizure. They argue initially that taking the package out of the hamper and placing it in the package lineup was sufficient,\n   standing alone, to significantly\n   interfere with their possessory interests in the package. Alternatively, they contend that, because Craig intended to conduct a \"further investigation\" of the package when she removed it from the mail hamper, regardless of whether Nikko alerted, Craig did not intend to deliver the package unopened by the guaranteed delivery date and thus significantly interfered with their possessory interests in the package.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Before determining whether Craig's actions significantly interfered with defendants' ownership or possessory interests, we first identify what those interests were.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Owens\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2177103\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/302/196/#p206\">\n    302 Or. at 207\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2177103\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/302/196/#p206\">\n    729 P.2d 524\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Ordinarily, the question whether a person has an ownership or possessory interest in an object is straightforward. Typically, the two interests are united. However, those interests can be separated when, for example, a property owner leases property to another person or when a property owner gives the property to a bailee to store or transport. In the latter instance, the bailor retains an ownership interest in the property, but the bailee has a right to possess the property consistently with the terms of the bailment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Samuel Williston, 9\n   <em>\n    A Treatise on the Law of Contracts\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1030 at 879 (3d ed. 1967) (\"The rights, duties, and liabilities of the bailor and the bailee must be determined from the terms of the contract between the parties, whether express or implied.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   In this case, we assume that either Sholedice or Smith owned the contents of the package while it was in transit.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Sholedice, however, gave the USPS the package to deliver it to Smith. As a bailee or a common carrier, the USPS had the right to possess the package while it was in transit, and the USPS's and defendants' possessory rights in the package were defined by the USPS's agreement with Sholedice, which is found in the Domestic Mail Manual (DMM).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Barnthouse\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12186512\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/360/403/\">\n    360 Or. at 415\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12186512\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/360/403/\">\n    380 P.3d 952\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (relying on the DMM\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   to determine the defendant's contractual right as a third-party beneficiary of the agreement between the sender and the USPS to have the express mail parcel delivered by the guaranteed delivery date).\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   In arguing that Craig's actions constituted a seizure, defendants have focused on Craig's interference with their possessory interests in the package while it was in transit, not on any interference with their ownership interests in the package.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   Specifically, they have argued that, under the DMM, the USPS's authority to possess the package did not permit the sort of inspection that Craig undertook. Alternatively, they argue that the DMM gave them affirmative rights to redirect\n   the delivery or the return of the package while it was in transit. For those reasons, defendants contend, Craig's actions significantly interfered with their possessory interests in the package.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   We reach a different conclusion. We first explain why Craig's actions in screening the package were consistent with the terms of the bailment, as defined by the DMM. We then explain why Craig's actions did not interfere with any affirmative rights or possessory interests that the DMM gave defendants while the package was in transit. Finally,\n   we note that defendants have not argued that, even if Craig complied with the terms of the bailment, Article I, section 9, imposed additional limitations on her actions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Defendants argue that, under the DMM, the USPS's authority to possess the package for the purpose of delivering it to Smith did not extend to detaining it so that Nikko could sniff it. Apparently relying on DMM 113.2.2, Sholedice argues that \"postal service rules indicat[e] that express mail will not be inspected.\" He thus finds in the DMM an \"implied commitment by the postal service that it will do only what is needed to achieve delivery of a package.\" Smith, for her part, recognizes that the USPS may engage in some \"screening\" of packages but argues that \"the inspectors' actions in this case went far beyond the 'screening' that USPS customers would reasonably expect.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   We begin with Sholedice's argument, which appears to be based on DMM 113.2.2.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   That section of the DMM provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   \"Matter closed against postal inspection includes First-Class Mail, Priority Mail, or Express Mail. The USPS may open mail other than First-Class Mail, Priority Mail, or Express Mail.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   As the words of DMM 113.2.2 make clear, that section of the DMM reflects long-standing Fourth Amendment cases explaining which classes of mail the USPS may open without a warrant.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Van Leeuwen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12052564\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/397/249/#p250\">\n    397 U.S. 249\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 250-51,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12052564\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/397/249/#p250\">\n    90 S.Ct. 1029\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12052564\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/397/249/#p250\">\n    25 L.Ed.2d 282\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1970) (describing federal cases). As the Court recognized in\n   <em>\n    Van Leeuwen\n   </em>\n   , the USPS may not open and inspect first-class mail except with a warrant or an exception to the warrant requirement; however, lesser classes of mail may be opened and inspected without a warrant.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12052564\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/397/249/#p250\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   In this case, Craig did not open defendants' package, and defendants do not argue that Nikko's sniff constituted a search of the package. As a result, DMM 113.2.2\n   has no application to Craig's actions, and Sholedice does not identify any other provision of the DMM that limited Craig's ability to take defendants' package out of the hamper and put it on the floor so Nikko could sniff it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Smith's argument is closer to the mark. As noted, she recognizes that the USPS can engage in some screening of the mail it processes, but she argues that Craig's actions went beyond what the DMM permits. We read the DMM differently. Chapter 601 of the DMM defines harmful and hazardous materials that either cannot be mailed at all or only under specific conditions. DMM 601.8.1. Among other things, a person cannot mail poisons, controlled substances, poisonous insects and reptiles, live scorpions except when used for medical research, explosives, acids, highly flammable liquids, gases that are likely to ignite during transport, radioactive material, and alligators over 20 inches in length. DMM 601.8.5 (defining harmful matter that is not mailable); DMM 601.8.6 (defining hazardous matter that is not mailable);\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   DMM 601.9.3.3 (authorizing shipment of baby alligators under 20 inches); DMM 601.9.3.9 (authorizing shipment of live scorpions for use in medical research but only when appropriately packaged).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   In addition to defining what may not be mailed, the DMM provides that \"[a] postmaster may take any step reasonable and necessary to protect USPS employees and equipment\n   from potentially dangerous or injurious materials or substances found in the mail.\" DMM 601.8.13. That regulation gives the USPS the right to take reasonable and necessary steps to ensure that packages placed in the mail do not contain prohibited substances. In that respect, it merely codifies the common law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Illinois v. Andreas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6200096\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/463/765/\">\n    463 U.S. 765\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 769 n. 1,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6200096\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/463/765/\">\n    103 S.Ct. 3319\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6200096\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/463/765/\">\n    77 L.Ed.2d 1003\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1983) (recognizing that \"[c]ommon carriers have a common-law right to inspect packages they accept for shipment, based on their duty to refrain from carrying contraband\"). Although the DMM does not define what constitutes \"reasonable and necessary\" steps, the Court's Fourth Amendment cases define the steps the USPS reasonably can take to ensure that the mail is not misused. We look to those federal decisions to determine what steps will be \"reasonable and necessary\" for the purposes of the federal rule.\n   The Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Van Leeuwen\n   </em>\n   provides the most relevant guidance. In that case, the defendant mailed two 12-pound packages by registered mail from a town in Washington near the Canadian border. He listed the contents of the packages as \"coins,\" used \"a vacant housing area of a nearby junior college\" as the return address, and drove a car with British Columbia plates.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 249-50,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12052564\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/397/249/#p250\">\n    90 S.Ct. 1029\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Those facts caused the postal official to suspect something was amiss, and the official detained the packages initially for an hour and a half while customs officials checked the addressee of one of the packages.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12052564\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/397/249/#p250\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12052564\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/397/249/#p250\">\n    at 250\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12052564\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/397/249/#p250\">\n    90 S.Ct. 1029\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . They learned that that addressee was under investigation for trafficking in illegal coins, and the postal official held the other package until the next day when he confirmed that the other addressee was under investigation for the same crime.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12052564\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/397/249/#p250\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   At that point, a customs official sought a search warrant to open both packages.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12052564\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/397/249/#p250\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   In considering whether the postal official had violated the defendant's Fourth Amendment rights by detaining his packages while he investigated them, Justice Douglas, writing for a unanimous Court, explained that, although the postal service could not open and search first-class mail without a warrant or a warrant exception, \"even first-class mail is not beyond the reach of all inspection.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12052564\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/397/249/#p250\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12052564\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/397/249/#p250\">\n    at 252\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12052564\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/397/249/#p250\">\n    90 S.Ct. 1029\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Similarly, the trial court could have found that the time that it took for Nikko to sniff the packages in the package lineup was minimal. That is, the trial court reasonably could have found that the minimal detention of defendants' package was reasonable and necessary in light of the facts that caused Craig to take defendants' package out of the mail hamper in the first place. We accordingly disagree with defendants' argument that, in briefly placing the package in a package lineup for Nikko to sniff, Craig's actions went beyond what the DMM authorized.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Defendants also argue, however, that Craig's actions interfered with their affirmative right to redirect the package during transit either by having it held for pickup, by having it sent to a different address, or by having it returned to Sholedice. On that issue, we note that, ordinarily, a package will be delivered to the address listed on the package. DMM 508.1.1.1. However, the addressee can alter when and where an express mail package will be delivered. An addressee\n   can ask that express mail be held at the post office for three to 30 days for later delivery or pickup, or ask that express mail be forwarded to a temporary address or a new permanent address. DMM 507.2.1.2-3. Additionally, a sender may mail a package using a \"hold for pickup\" label, which means that the package will be sent to a designated post office and held for a limited period of time until the addressee picks it up. DMM 508.7.2.1-2. Finally, noncommercial customers or their authorized representatives \"may request to have their package intercepted and redirected to [the] sender.\" DMM 507.5.5.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Defendants infer from the ability to request either a change in the time and place of delivery or that a package be intercepted and returned to the sender that they had a constitutionally protected possessory interest in the package while it was in transit. The state responds that, under\n   the DMM, defendants only had a right to ask that mail be redirected; they did not have an absolute right to have it be redirected.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   We need not resolve that dispute to decide the point that defendants raise. Even if we assume that defendants had a right to have the package be redirected or returned to the sender and that those rights created a constitutionally protected possessory interest, it is difficult to see how taking defendants' package from the hamper and placing it on the floor for Nikko to sniff significantly interfered with those possessory interests. Defendants do not argue that they sought to redirect the delivery of the package or to request that it be returned to the sender, nor do they explain how Craig's actions actually interfered with the exercise of rights they never sought to exercise. Moreover, even if they had sought to exercise those rights, it is difficult to see how moving the package a minimal distance for a minimal time would have interfered with, much less significantly interfered with, the possessory interests that they identify. That is particularly true when the terms of the bailment expressly permitted Craig to take the \"reasonable and necessary\" steps that she did to check whether the mail contained contraband, poisons, or hazardous material.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   We accordingly conclude that Craig acted consistently with the terms on which the USPS took possession of defendants' package when she took their package out of the mail hamper and put it in a package lineup for Nikko to sniff. Not only did the DMM 601.8.13 affirmatively authorize Craig, as a USPS postal inspector, to take \"reasonable and necessary\" steps to protect postal employees from \"any potentially dangerous or injurious materials or substances found in the mail,\" but her actions did not significantly interfere with defendants' rights to redirect the mail or have it returned to the sender. Because Craig acted consistently with the terms of the bailment, we hold that taking the package out of the hamper and putting it on the floor for Nikko to sniff did not significantly interfere with defendants' possessory interests in the package.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   We note three qualifications to that holding. First, our holding is limited to the situation that this case\n   presents-a situation in which the government actor (the USPS) possessed the package as a bailee and acted pursuant to the terms of the bailment. The second qualification is related to the first. This is not a case in which a government agency that was not the bailee (an outside police agency, for example) sought to interfere with property entrusted to a bailee. In that situation, the police would not be authorized as the bailee to take the actions that Craig took here, and we express no opinion on whether those actions-if taken by a government official other than the bailee-would constitute a seizure. Finally, the trial court reasonably could find on this record that Craig was not acting at the behest of an outside police agency when she took the package out of the hamper and put it in the package lineup. The trial court implicitly made that finding when it expressly found that the \"reason\" Craig took the package out of the hamper for Nikko to sniff was to\n   protect federal postal employees. This case accordingly does not require us to consider the issue that the Court of Appeals addressed in\n   <em>\n    Barnthouse\n   </em>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   One other point warrants mention. In analyzing the parties' contract rights under the DMM, we do not mean to suggest that defendants' constitutional possessory interests are necessarily coextensive with the terms of the bailment. However, we explained in\n   <em>\n    Barnthouse\n   </em>\n   that \"[t]he concept of a possessory interest, as it is pertinent to Article I, section 9, is grounded in property law.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12186512\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/360/403/\">\n    360 Or. at 415\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12186512\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/360/403/\">\n    380 P.3d 952\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12186512\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/360/403/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (explaining that \" Article I, section 9, emphasizes property law concepts in determining what qualifies as a protected possessory interest\"). Without some explanation as to why defendants' constitutionally protected possessory interests were greater than the possessory interests created by the bailment, we are not persuaded that Craig's act of taking the package out of the hamper and putting it on the floor for Nikko to sniff significantly interfered with defendants' constitutionally protected possessory interests. Other courts have reached a similar conclusion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Wayne R. LaFave,\n   4\n   <em>\n    Search and Seizure\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 9.8(e) 1011-12 n. 173 (5th ed. 2012) (listing cases holding that a minimal detention of a package by both private and public mail services so that a trained dog could sniff it did not meaningfully interfere with the defendant's possessory interests and thus did not constitute a seizure).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Defendants advance an alternative argument based on Craig's answer to a hypothetical question. As noted above, at the suppression hearing, defendants asked Craig what she would have done if Nikko had not alerted to the package, and Craig answered that she would not have returned it to the ordinary stream of mail. Rather, she would have done a further investigation, which she described as \"try[ing] to get ahold of M. Smith or Nathan * * * Sholedice\" and \"talk[ing] to them a little bit about the parcel to get some more information.\" Defendants infer from Craig's answer that, even if Nikko had not alerted, Craig would not have delivered the package to Smith unopened by the guaranteed delivery date of May 29. It follows, they contend, that, when Craig took the package out of the mail hamper and put it on the floor, she significantly interfered with defendants' possessory interest in having the package delivered by the guaranteed delivery date.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   We note, as an initial matter, that Craig did not say that she would not have delivered the package unopened to Smith by the guaranteed delivery date if Nikko had not alerted; she said only that she would have processed the package separately while engaging in further investigation, which she testified meant trying to talk with defendants \"a little bit about the parcel to get some more information.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   Beyond that, the more difficult problem for defendants is that their argument is based on a hypothetical set of facts that never occurred. Specifically, defendants argue that, if Nikko had not alerted, Craig would have asked for consent before delivering the package and, in so doing, would have seized it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Nikko, however, did alert. Accordingly, the question is not whether Craig would have taken additional steps that would have amounted to a seizure if Nikko had not alerted. Rather, the question is whether the steps that Craig in fact took before Nikko alerted amounted to a seizure. If they did not, and they did not for the reasons explained above, then the only question that remains is whether, once Nikko alerted, Craig and Helton's actions amounted to an\n   unreasonable seizure; that is, after Nikko alerted, did having a postal inspector take the package to Smith's house in Lincoln City and ask for consent to search constitute an unreasonable seizure? We turn to that issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   In considering whether Helton's actions constituted a seizure, defendants argue that this case is not materially different from our decision in\n   <em>\n    Barnthouse\n   </em>\n   . In considering that argument, we first describe our decision in\n   <em>\n    Barnthouse\n   </em>\n   . We then explain how this case differs from\n   <em>\n    Barnthouse\n   </em>\n   .

In this case, Helton did not tell defendants, as the police officer did in\n   <em>\n    Barnthouse\n   </em>\n   , that, if defendants did not consent, Helton would apply for a warrant. Helton thus did not explicitly state that he would retain the package if defendants declined consent. Additionally, the trial court did not rule in defendants' favor, as the trial court did in\n   <em>\n    Barnthouse\n   </em>\n   . Because of that procedural difference, we do not draw all reasonable inferences in defendants' favor as we did in\n   <em>\n    Barnthouse\n   </em>\n   . Despite those two\n   differences, we still conclude that Helton seized the package at least temporarily.\n   It is undisputed that, when Helton came to Smith's house, he did not immediately give her the package as a mail carrier ordinarily would. Rather, he withheld delivering the package, told her that he was a federal inspector charged with investigating the misuse of the mail, said that he believed the package contained either drugs or the proceeds of drug sales, and asked her for consent to search it. Those acts constituted a sufficient show of authority that Helton seized the package.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Juarez-Godinez\n   </em>\n   , 326 Or. at 6,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"502403\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/326/1/\">\n    942 P.2d 772\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (explaining that a seizure of property may be accomplished either by physical force or by a show of authority). More specifically, a reasonable person would have understood from those acts that Helton was going to retain the package for a longer period of time than the USPS was authorized to do under the terms of the bailment. We do not mean to suggest that every request for consent constitutes a seizure. However, by retaining the package and asking for consent instead of immediately tendering the package to Smith, Helton seized the package at least temporarily. In that respect, this case is similar to\n   <em>\n    Barnthouse\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   This case, however, differs from\n   <em>\n    Barnthouse\n   </em>\n   in one way that is material.

Although Sholedice does not concede the point, he does not dispute it. More specifically, Sholedice never explains why, in light of the trial\n   court's finding that Nikko's training and experience qualified under\n   <em>\n    Foster\n   </em>\n   , Nikko was not sufficiently reliable that his alert alone established probable cause.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Foster\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3674557\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/350/161/\">\n    350 Or. at 177-78\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3674557\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/350/161/\">\n    252 P.3d 292\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (explaining the degree of reliability necessary to establish that a dog's alert, standing alone, establishes probable cause).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Moreover, when Nikko's alert is considered together with the factors that Craig identified that made her suspicious about the package, Craig's understanding that the package was being sent from an out-of-state address to an Oregon address listed as a medical marijuana grow, and Helton's detection of the odor of marijuana when he approached Smith's front door, we conclude that Helton had probable cause to believe that the package contained either drugs prohibited by federal law or the proceeds from illegal drug sales. Additionally, because the package was coming from out-of-state, Helton had probable cause to believe that defendants were in violation of state criminal law-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , that the applicable 2014 exemption from state criminal laws for the possession and distribution of medical marijuana did not apply to the interstate sale or transportation of marijuana.\n   <em>\n    See former\n   </em>\n   ORS 475.309(1) (2013) (providing limited exceptions to state criminal laws prohibiting the possession and delivery of marijuana);\n   <em>\n    former\n   </em>\n   ORS 475.316 (2013) (same) ;\n   <em>\n    former\n   </em>\n   ORS 475.320 (2013) (same).\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Defendants argue that, even if Helton had probable cause to believe that the package\n   contained contraband, he needed a warrant to seize it. We note, as an initial matter, that Helton seized the package only long enough to ask for consent. If we apply the same standards to seizures of property that we apply to seizures of people, as\n   <em>\n    Juarez-Godinez\n   </em>\n   teaches, it is difficult to see why Helton's seizure was not equivalent to a permissible\n   <em>\n    Terry\n   </em>\n   stop for the purposes of asking for consent.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Juarez-Godinez\n   </em>\n   , 326 Or. at 6,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"502403\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/326/1/\">\n    942 P.2d 772\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (explaining that cases addressing the seizures of persons are instructive in deciding when property has been seized unconstitutionally).

Under\n   <em>\n    Owens\n   </em>\n   , the warrantless seizure in this case was constitutionally permissible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Finally, defendants do not dispute that a federal warrant was necessary to search the package while it was in the postal service's possession and that it have would have taken 24 to 48 hours to obtain a warrant from a federal judge. Because Craig did not come across the package until the morning of May 28, 2014, and the guaranteed delivery time was 3:00 p.m. the next day, she reasonably could have concluded that a federal warrant could not have been obtained in time to deliver the package to Lincoln City.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

Indeed, the trial court's factual findings appear to accept that proposition. Faced with the likelihood that Smith would dispose of the contents of the package once it was delivered, Helton reasonably retained the package while asking for Smith's and Sholedice's consent to search.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   As Justice Linde explained in\n   <em>\n    State v. Brown\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2178861\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/301/268/\">\n    301 Or. 268\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2178861\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/301/268/\">\n    721 P.2d 1357\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1986), when officers have probable cause to believe that a stopped car contains contraband, they\n   can \"offer the person [in possession of the car] an informed choice between consenting to an immediate search or having the automobile held for the time necessary to obtain a warrant.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2178861\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/301/268/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2178861\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/301/268/\">\n    at 295\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2178861\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/301/268/\">\n    721 P.2d 1357\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (dissenting opinion).

In light of that reasoning, Helton's request for consent to search the package, which he retained only briefly, did not run afoul of Article I, section 9. To the extent that Helton's request for consent effected a seizure, his brief seizure of the package was reasonable.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Barnthouse\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12186512\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/360/403/\">\n    360 Or. at 420\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12186512\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/360/403/\">\n    380 P.3d 952\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"only seizures that are 'unreasonable' violate Article I, section 9\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   We accordingly conclude that Craig did not seize the package when she put it in a package lineup for Nikko to sniff and that the seizure effectuated by Helton's request for consent was reasonable.
