Both killings occurred during a burglary spree committed by Hedlund and his half-brother and co-defendant, James McKinney. The trial judge found two aggravating factors concerning the first degree murder: (1) Hedlund was previously convicted of a serious offense; and (2) he committed the murder for pecuniary gain.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   A.R.S. \u00a7 13-751(F)(2), (F)(5).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   After hearing the mitigating evidence, the trial judge sentenced Hedlund to death.

In 2003, Hedlund filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the United States District Court for the District of Arizona as well as a motion to expand the evidentiary record, which was denied. The district court ruled that Hedlund was not entitled to habeas relief. In 2017, the Ninth Circuit reversed, concluding that habeas relief was warranted because this Court had erred in its independent review of the death sentence when considering Hedlund's mitigation evidence.\n   <em>\n    Hedlund v.

In\n   <em>\n    Clabourne\n   </em>\n   , the independent review was from resentencing in which the defendant presented evidence from habeas proceedings and the sentencing court made findings based on that evidence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"59860\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/194/379/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 383 \u00b6 11,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"59860\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/194/379/\">\n    983 P.2d 748\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

However, the aggravator here is especially strong, and Hedlund's active complicity in the crimes is clear. We agree with the well-supported trial court conclusion that Hedlund was \"consciously involved in an ongoing crime spree to commit residential burglaries and intended to either kill or beat any of the victims who might have been present during these crimes.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b6 14 Indeed, testimony at trial showed that Hedlund and McKinney asked their peers if they \"knew any houses [from which] they could rob like a lot of money and stuff\" when planning the crime spree. And as this Court observed in Hedlund's direct appeal, he stated that \"anyone he found would be beaten in the head.\"\n   <em>\n    McKinney\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1488579\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/185/567/#p571\">\n    185 Ariz. at 571, 580\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1488579\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/185/567/#p571\">\n    917 P.2d at 1218, 1227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Consistent with that statement, Hedlund indicated that if anyone was home during the Mertens burglary \"they [could] just sneak in, hit them over the head, knock them out and then take the money.\" And Hedlund targeted McClain because, based on a prior car sale between them, Hedlund believed McClain had property that would be easy to sell as well as money within the residence. In fact, Hedlund's fingerprints were found on a briefcase within McClain's home, which suggests that Hedlund searched for valuable items. Finally, the evidence shows that Hedlund intentionally armed himself, as demonstrated by his acquisition of a new weapon for the McClain burglary, and actively concealed stolen property and weapons taken during that burglary. This evidence strongly established the pecuniary gain aggravator, which our Court affirmed in 1996, and the Ninth Circuit left undisturbed.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1488579\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/185/567/#p571\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1488579\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/185/567/#p571\">\n    at 583-84\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1488579\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/185/567/#p571\">\n    917 P.2d at 1230-31\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Clearly, the evidence of pecuniary gain as the primary, if not sole, purpose of the murders is overwhelming and inescapable.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b6 15 \"When assessing the weight and quality of a mitigating factor, we take into account how the mitigating factor relates to the commission of the offense.\"\n   <em>\n    Styers\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4057958\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/227/186/\">\n    227 Ariz. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   189 \u00b6 12,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4057958\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/227/186/\">\n    254 P.3d at 1135\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Expert mitigating testimony\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b6 16 Hedlund asserts that expert testimony he presented during sentencing establishes substantial mitigating weight under \u00a7 13-751(G)(1). That statute provides for mitigation when \"[t]he defendant's capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of law was significantly impaired, but not so impaired as to constitute a defense to prosecution.\" \u00a7 13-751(G)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b6 17 At the sentencing hearing, two mental health experts testified for the defendant: Dr. Ronald Holler and Dr. Charles Shaw. Dr. Holler met with Hedlund for a two-day interview to evaluate Hedlund's \"intellectual, cognitive, neuropsychological, [and] emotional functioning as related to his background with his family and other aspects of his environment.\" Dr. Holler also based much of his testimony on reports from other sources. Based on this information, Dr. Holler concluded that because Hedlund experienced emotional and physical abuse as a child, he suffered from battered child disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder (\"PTSD\"), and \"intertwined disorders of much consequence including alcohol dependence and a depressive disorder.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b6 18 Dr. Holler testified that Hedlund's \"mental impairments would significantly impair his capacity to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law\" because Hedlund's relationship with his brother, McKinney, \"created an unusual or substantial duress in his life\" resulting from his desire for family. However, on cross-examination, Dr. Holler also testified that it is possible that Hedlund had sufficient mental acuity to conform his behavior if, hypothetically, a police officer were present during the burglary that resulted in McClain's murder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b6 19 Based on a single interview, Dr. Shaw testified primarily about Hedlund's relationship with alcohol, concluding that Hedlund \"suffer[ed] from alcohol dependence or alcoholism.\" Dr. Shaw testified that individuals with alcoholism can suffer \"from perception, memory and judgment problems even [when] not intoxicated,\" and he had \"encountered alcoholics who because of their alcoholism have committed acts they never would have committed but for the existence of alcoholism.\" Much of Dr. Shaw's testimony was based on Hedlund's self-reported use of alcohol, and Dr. Shaw could not state with any certainty if and by how much Hedlund was intoxicated on the night of the McClain burglary and murder. However, Dr. Shaw's testimony established that even with alcohol in his system, an individual would not \"lose complete awareness of what is moral\" but it might affect judgment regarding what is wrong under the law or what the individual can \"get away with.\" In addition, \"Hedlund's character witnesses testified that Hedlund did not have a drinking problem, was not an alcoholic, and that his level of consumption was far below what Hedlund reported to the psychiatric experts.\"\n   <em>\n    McKinney\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1488579\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/185/567/#p571\">\n    185 Ariz. at 579\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1488579\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/185/567/#p571\">\n    917 P.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1226 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 26-27.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b6 20 Based on our independent analysis, we conclude, as did the trial court, that the expert testimony had little credibility or probative value. Though the dissent asserts that the experts' opinions provide strong evidence of mitigation because the State provided no expert testimony to rebut Hedlund's experts,\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   \u00b652, rebuttal was unnecessary as the State brought out key testimony during cross-examination of Dr. Holler and Dr. Shaw that effectively impeached their opinions and weighed against mitigation. We are particularly persuaded by Dr. Holler's opinion that Hedlund was capable of modifying his behavior if an officer had been present and Dr. Shaw's opinion that Hedlund remained aware of what was moral. This evidence undermines Hedlund's and the dissent's view that he suffered mental impairments that significantly impaired his capacity to conform his conduct to what the law requires. Additionally, the experts testified that Hedlund's mental\n   impairments result from his childhood neglect and abuse at least a decade prior to the crimes. Just before the crime spree, Hedlund had a responsible job and exhibited no violent behavior; he acted lucidly in planning and executing the crimes and in attempting to dispose of and hide the murder weapon. The evidence does not support the conclusion that Hedlund lacked the ability to conform his conduct to the requirements of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b6 21 The dissent asserts that\n   <em>\n    State v.

Because\n   <em>\n    Stevens\n   </em>\n   is inapposite, we disagree. In\n   <em>\n    Stevens\n   </em>\n   , we gave strong mitigating weight to expert testimony introduced by the defendant because it showed \"his ability to conform his behavior [to] the requirements of the law were [sic] impaired at that time.\"\n   <em>\n    Stevens\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1524179\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/158/595/\">\n    158 Ariz. at 599-600\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1524179\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/158/595/\">\n    764 P.2d at 728-29\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (alteration in original). The dissent suggests that the\n   <em>\n    Stevens\n   </em>\n   Court relied on the fact that the defendant had a \"mental disorder\" that caused his diminished capacity.\n   <em>\n    Infra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 54. However, this Court actually concluded \"Stevens' condition at the time of the offense was a major and contributing cause of his conduct\" based primarily on the expert testimony that the defendant's \"actions were the result of his heavy use of alcohol and drugs preceding his meeting with the victims and a well-developed habit of acting out on socially unacceptable impulses while under the influence of such intoxicants.\"\n   <em>\n    Stevens\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1524179\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/158/595/\">\n    158 Ariz. at 599-600\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1524179\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/158/595/\">\n    764 P.2d at 728-29\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In contrast, the only evidence of Hedlund's alleged intoxication during the McClain murder was his own self-reporting to Dr. Shaw well after the murder; as such,\n   <em>\n    Stevens\n   </em>\n   is distinguishable as it is unclear if Hedlund was intoxicated during the commission of the crimes. Even if Hedlund was intoxicated when he committed the McClain burglary and murder, nothing in the record suggests alcohol affected his ability to appreciate right from wrong or conform his conduct to law, unlike the defendant in\n   <em>\n    Stevens\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Infra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 26-27.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b6 22 In sum, the expert testimony and the record do not establish that Hedlund could not appreciate right from wrong or conform his conduct to the requirements of law. Accordingly, we give the expert testimony regarding Hedlund's PTSD, alcoholism, and depressive disorder slight mitigating weight.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Other mitigating circumstances\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b6 23 Hedlund presents other mitigating evidence, namely his emotionally and physically abusive childhood and dysfunctional family life, intoxication, minor participation, remorse, and the rejected plea agreement. We address the proffered mitigation evidence in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    Emotionally and physically abusive childhood and dysfunctional family life\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b6 24 Testimony from Hedlund's family and friends establish that Hedlund experienced a very abusive childhood. He was neglected, beaten, and punished for basic daily activities like eating and drinking water. Moreover, his step-mother would frequently isolate Hedlund and punish him because he was born out of wedlock. And Hedlund grew up in a household where stealing was encouraged and rewarded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b6 25 Hedlund left the home around age thirteen, more than ten years before the crimes, and no evidence shows that Hedlund's difficult childhood affected his ability to control his actions to conform with the law. Hedlund's feeling of responsibility \"to hang around with his brother, James, out of some twisted loyalty to the only family he knows\"-as Dr. Holler suggested-does not amount to an inability to control his actions. Thus, despite the terrible conditions in which Hedlund was raised, we assign this evidence little weight because there is neither temporal proximity nor any demonstration that the conditions rendered Hedlund unable to differentiate right from wrong or to control his actions.\n   <em>\n    Supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 16-22;\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    State v.

We consider this evidence as both a statutory mitigating circumstance under \u00a7 13-751(G)(1) and a non-statutory mitigating factor. We find little credibility in Hedlund's self-reporting because he had a motive to lie and evidence presented at trial proved he had been untruthful.

As explained in more detail below, Hedlund does not meet this criterion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   <strong>\n    Childhood Abuse and Expert Testimony\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   \u00b6 42 Although the majority characterizes Hedlund's childhood abuse and neglect as \"very abusive,\"\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 24, it was nothing short of horrific. When he lived with his biological mother and stepfather, McKinney Sr., until the age of six or seven, he and his siblings were subjected to extreme neglect. They ate only if they were able to get food themselves, and, when they did, it was often moldy and rotten. They were rarely clothed and, when they were, it was in \"filth-encrusted clothes.\" They lived and slept surrounded by animal feces and urine. Hedlund's mother \"would stack used [feminine hygiene products] around rooms in the house\" and never cleaned the children's diapers. Mary Durand, a presentence report investigator, described the conditions \"as gruesome as anything that [she had] come across in 25-plus years in this business.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   \u00b6 43 When the children moved in with McKinney Sr., their stepmother, and her daughter, the neglect continued, with the addition of severe physical and mental abuse. Hedlund, the oldest, was the only one of his siblings to have a different father, and his stepmother would tell him daily that \"he was a bastard child\" who \"didn't have a father.\" The house was \"always dirty,\" as were the children who often \"smelled like animal dung.\" The McKinneys kept animals such as a goat and calf, chickens, monkeys, and snakes inside the house. Even though the children were terrified of snakes, their cage was kept inside the closet of the children's bedroom. If the children did not clean up the animals' feces, it \"didn't get cleaned up.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   \u00b6 44 The children were not allowed to have food unless approved by their stepmother and were beaten if they ate or drank without her permission. She also frequently locked them out of the house, typically without adequate clothing and with no food or water for hours at a time and in temperatures upward of 100 degrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   \u00b6 45 Their stepmother, often with the help of her daughter, beat the children daily with objects ranging from \"belts with steel prongs\" to \"wire hangers\" and cooking pans. Hedlund, however, \"got more beatings than [the other children], because he wasn't a McKinney.\" Hedlund's sister\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   recalled that either their stepmother or her daughter would \"hold [Hedlund] down on the ground ... [and] the other one would beat him.\" In one incident, McKinney Sr.'s dog attacked Hedlund, resulting in over 200 stitches to his face. The next morning, his stepmother woke Hedlund and beat him for an hour \"because it cost[ ] her money to take him to the hospital.\" Additionally, whenever Hedlund's half-brother and co-defendant, James McKinney, would get into trouble, Hedlund would be beaten as well because he \"was the oldest and ... should have known better.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   \u00b6 46 A theme that pervades the family's recollections of Hedlund as a child was that\n   he consistently tried to protect his siblings from the abuse and would take their beatings for them. His sister recalled, \"If we were going to get a beating or slapped in the face or punched in the face, [Hedlund] would jump in the middle and he would take the hit for us.\" During one instance, their stepmother grabbed McKinney by the wrist, lifted him into the air, and began beating him with a piece of garden hose. Hedlund \"jumped on her arm and was begging her, 'Momma, stop it. Momma, stop it.' \" The stepmother flung Hedlund onto the sidewalk, where he hit the back of his head, and then hit him across the face with the hose. Not only did he protect, or try to protect, his siblings from his stepmother's abuse, he also tried to protect his sisters from McKinney, who would often hit them with boards, shovels, and rakes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   \u00b6 47 Dr. Holler explained that Hedlund's childhood abuse caused lasting neuropsychological impairments, as reflected, in part, by a disparity in his IQ scores. Hedlund's verbal IQ-associated with the left side of the brain-was 91, but his performance IQ-associated with the right side-was 78. The low performance IQ is indicative of difficulty \"using good judgment and avoiding getting [oneself] into severe difficulties.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   \u00b6 48 According to Dr. Holler, Hedlund's childhood experiences, in particular the constant reminders that he was not fully biologically related to his family, caused him to become \"a very needy person psychologically\" and he had \"developed a distortion of motivations to be accepted in a familial sense.\" He was thus \"very vulnerable and subject to becoming enmeshed with others ... to try to become a member of a family.\" He also took on a \"docile\" and \"accom[m]odating\" nature, such that if someone were to become more aggressive, Hedlund \"would be very much subject to going along\" with that person in order to maintain his role as protector and fulfill his need to demonstrate loyalty. Dr. Holler ultimately concluded that Hedlund's childhood abuse and resulting mental impairments\"significantly impair[ed] his capacity to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   \u00b6 49 Dr. Holler's opinions are supported not only by the testimony of Hedlund's siblings but also by others who knew him throughout his life. One of his aunts described him as a \"quiet\" child who \"ached for someone to love him.\" His childhood friend noted he would always look out for her and keep her \"out of trouble.\" And his sister testified that even though Hedlund was the oldest sibling, when they were children \"whatever [McKinney] said [Hedlund] did.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   \u00b6 50 Each person who knew Hedlund as a child and adult testified he was a quiet, \"mild mannered,\" non-violent person who avoided confrontation and was \"scared\" of getting \"into fights.\" As an example, while McKinney and C.M., Hedlund's other half-brother, were committing another burglary, Hedlund, who was supposed to pick them up afterwards, abandoned them and drove away because he was \"scared of getting caught and he didn't want to be near the burglary.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   \u00b6 51 Hedlund's childhood efforts to protect his siblings, even at the risk of his own personal safety, continued into his adulthood. His sister testified that Hedlund protected her from abusive boyfriends. C.M. testified that Hedlund's involvement in the Mertens's burglary came about because he \"wanted to protect [C.M.]\" from \"get[ting] caught or get[ting] in trouble\" because the people in the Mertens's house knew C.M. and would be able to identify him. And, in the months leading up to these crimes, when McKinney and Hedlund were spending considerable time together, Hedlund told their sister he feared McKinney \"would go right back to prison\" if \"he had no one to talk to ... and be his friend and a family member.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   \u00b6 52 The State did not call any of its own expert witnesses to contradict those presented by Hedlund. Additionally, because the lay witnesses' testimony supported Dr. Holler's opinions, his testimony is entitled to \"serious consideration\" as a mitigating factor.\n   <em>\n    State v. Trostle\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"493296\" index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/191/4/#p21\">\n    191 Ariz. 4\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 21,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"493296\" index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/191/4/#p21\">\n    951 P.2d 869\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 884 (1997) (defendant's unrebutted expert testimony regarding mental illness and social dysfunction, supported by lay witnesses' descriptions of defendant, warranted \"serious consideration\" as a mitigating factor).

It demonstrates a causal connection between Hedlund's childhood that contributed to the murder of McClain: When faced with a choice between demonstrating loyalty to and protecting his brother, or conforming his conduct to the law, Hedlund's judgment and ability to choose the latter was significantly impaired.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

Dr. Holler, however, clarified that without the hypothetical police officer's immediate presence, Hedlund's \"dynamics [would] become predominant\" and \"lead him into actions which in terms of strictly intellectual capability, he would not do.\" Although the majority overlooks this nuanced opinion, there was no police officer present on the night of McClain's murder, so Hedlund's judgment indeed was influenced by what Dr. Holler characterized as his \"neuropsychological impairment\" at the time.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

For the following reasons, I disagree with that assessment as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   \u00b6 56 First, Dr. Holler's testimony shows that although Hedlund physically removed himself from the abuse, its effects did not simply end with a change in his physical surroundings. His neuropsychology and brain development were shaped by the years of abuse he endured, and it is unreasonable to believe any negative impact resolved after he moved out of the abusive environment. Second, Hedlund's life after leaving McKinney Sr.'s home was far from idyllic. After he moved out, he dropped out of school at age fourteen and began working as an agricultural field worker, picking cotton, vegetables, and sugar cane. When he was seventeen or eighteen, Hedlund attempted suicide. Third, after Hedlund left McKinney Sr.'s home, McKinney stayed behind and the brothers were separated. Before McKinney reappeared in Hedlund's life, Hedlund had held a steady job, been a reliable employee, and paid his bills. In the few months before these crimes, however, McKinney was released from jail and began demanding Hedlund's attention. Also during that time, McKinney Sr. and their stepmother had begun living with their aunt. Both of those circumstances caused Hedlund to \"[get] back around his father\" during this time. Thus, although Hedlund was not living in the same house with the daily abuse at the time of the crimes, he had recently become surrounded by circumstances reminiscent of that time in his life.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   \u00b6 57 Viewing the evidence cumulatively, as we must,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

The initial plea agreement provided that Hedlund would plead guilty to second-degree murder as to Mertens and theft \"[s]tacked with a prior\" as to McClain.

This may be true generally, but this case involves not one but two plea offers, the second of which would have permitted Hedlund to plead guilty to theft and burglary for the crimes committed against McClain, the same incident for which the death penalty is being affirmed. It is significant that had Hedlund's counsel not missed the deadline for entering a plea, Hedlund might not be facing the death penalty. Although we cannot know whether the trial court would have accepted the second plea, both offers are evidence that the State did not regard Hedlund as being as culpable as McKinney, who, from the record, it appears was never offered a plea. \"The plea offer's mitigatory effect is clear: the prosecution thought this was not a clear-cut death penalty case.\"\n   <em>\n    Scott v.

He had no job, no car, owed thousands of dollars in fines, and he was the one who proposed the burglaries to find cash and property to sell.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    McKinney\n   </em>\n   , 245 Ariz. at 227-28 \u00b6 12,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12570009\" index=\"163\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/426/1204/#p1207\">\n    426 P.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1206-07 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Spears\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1486508\" index=\"164\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/184/277/#p295\">\n    184 Ariz. at 292-93\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1486508\" index=\"165\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/184/277/#p295\">\n    908 P.2d at 1077\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (defendant's lack of money and source of income supported finding pecuniary gain).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   \u00b6 66 The majority points out that Hedlund stated that \"anyone he found would be beaten in the head\" as evidence of Hedlund's \"active complicity in the crimes.\"\n   <em>\n    Supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 14 (quoting\n   <em>\n    McKinney\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1488579\" index=\"166\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/185/567/#p571\">\n    185 Ariz. at 571, 580\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1488579\" index=\"167\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/185/567/#p571\">\n    917 P.2d at 1218\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1227 ). Indeed, Hedlund did say that he would hit anyone on the head who was home. But that was only in response to McKinney's assertion that he would shoot whomever he encountered and, according to C.M., was meant to \"give [McKinney] a different idea\" and get McKinney \"away from the idea ... of hurting anyone.\" Placed in context, this statement does not so clearly imply what the majority asserts it does.

However, there is no evidence which brother shot McClain, and while the evidence relied upon in\n   <em>\n    McKinney\n   </em>\n   does demonstrate that Hedlund participated in the McClain robbery, it does not, in fact, support the conclusion that he shot McClain.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1488579\" index=\"170\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/185/567/#p571\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   At Hedlund's sentencing, the trial court, after citing that same evidence, asserted \"it is unclear as to whether Mr. Hedlund or Mr. McKinney fired the shot which actually killed Mr. McClain.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   \u00b6 68 As discussed above, the mitigation evidence established Hedlund's overarching motivation was, as it had been since childhood, to protect his siblings, follow along with McKinney, particularly as McKinney grew more aggressive in the months leading up to the crimes, and to mitigate, to the extent he could, his brother's criminal tendencies. Thus, the fact that he attempted to sell or hide the weapons after the crime is not, contrary to the majority's assertion, illustrative of his financial motives.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 35-36. McKinney's aggressiveness in demanding Hedlund's car and companionship before the crime also makes it unclear whether Hedlund supplied the gun used in the McClain murder or McKinney simply commandeered it.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 35-36. Further, although Hedlund participated in the McClain burglary despite knowing McKinney had killed Mertens, that fact, again, fits with both Dr. Holler's and the lay witnesses' testimony about Hedlund's loyalty to McKinney. Shortly before the burglaries, Hedlund expressed his distress over McKinney being \"up to his old things again\" and \"had broken into houses.\" When his friend advised Hedlund to stay away from McKinney, Hedlund replied \"That's very impossible, with him being my brother.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   \u00b6 69 After considering all the evidence, it is clear that Hedlund's motivation to participate in the crimes could just as easily have been out of love for and loyalty to McKinney, as well as a misguided attempt to mitigate McKinney's actions and their consequences, as it was out of a personal desire to benefit financially.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    White v.
