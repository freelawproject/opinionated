In\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court held that \"mandatory life without parole for those under the age of 18 at the time of their crimes violates the Eighth Amendment's prohibition on 'cruel and unusual punishments.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 465,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407312\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/460/\">\n    132 S.Ct. 2455\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In this instance, Helm has failed to establish that the court abused its discretion. Thus, while we grant review, we deny relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b6 2 In 1984, at the age of fourteen, Helm murdered his father, his mother, and his sister. He subsequently pled guilty to first-degree murder, and two counts of second-degree murder, as well as a related armed robbery. The trial court sentenced him to life imprisonment with the possibility of parole after twenty-five years for the first-degree murder, twenty-one-year prison terms for each count of second-degree murder, and a twenty-one-year term for armed robbery. The three sentences for murder were to be served consecutively to each other but concurrently with the sentence for armed robbery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 3 On appeal to the Arizona Supreme Court, Helm asserted, as his only issue, that the three sentences for murder should not have been consecutive. The court affirmed his convictions and sentences.\n   <em>\n    State v. Helm\n   </em>\n   , No. CR-86-0050-AP, 2 (Ariz. Jun. 2, 1987) (mem. decision) (\"[I]t was not error in this\n   case for the judge to impose consecutive sentences.\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 4 In June 2013, Helm filed a pro se notice of post-conviction relief in which he argued\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   was a significant change in the law applicable to his sentences. The trial court summarily dismissed the notice, concluding\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   did not apply because Helm's life sentence provided for the possibility of parole. Helm did not seek review of that ruling. In July 2015, Helm sent a letter to the court asserting his sentences were \"the functional equivalent of life without parole.\" In response, the court noted that, although it had already denied relief, \"there may be new information or further developments in the law\" relevant to his claim. Thus, the court appointed counsel \"for the sole purpose of conferring with [Helm] and assessing whether there are any viable Rule 32 claims or whether the court should reconsider its prior denial of Rule 32 Relief.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 5 Through counsel, Helm filed a petition for post-conviction relief asserting\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   was a significant change in the law rendering his aggregate sentences improper. He identified decisions from other jurisdictions supporting his assertion that the rule announced in\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   applies to aggregate prison terms. The trial court summarily denied relief, and this petition for review followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 6 On review, Helm summarizes his claim based on\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   . He again lists several cases from other jurisdictions that have concluded that a sentence imposed on a juvenile that is functionally a life sentence because it exceeds the defendant's \"expected mortality rate[ ]\" is a life sentence without the possibility of release, in violation of\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 7 Helm is entitled to relief under\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   if it constitutes \"a significant change in the law that, if applied to [his] case, would probably overturn [his] conviction or sentence.\" Ariz. R. Crim. P. 32.1(g). As interpreted by the Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Montgomery\n   </em>\n   , the Court in\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   held that \"sentencing a child to life without parole is excessive for all but 'the rare juvenile offender whose crime reflects irreparable corruption.' \"\n   <em>\n    Montgomery v.

Neither\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   nor\n   <em>\n    Montgomery\n   </em>\n   addressed consecutive sentences imposed for multiple murders. Further, no controlling authority has rejected the approach dictated by our supreme court in\n   <em>\n    Berger\n   </em>\n   .
