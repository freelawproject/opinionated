He appeals the trial court's calculation of his offender score. He argues that a prior out-of-state conviction, which is not factually or legally comparable to a Washington criminal offense, and his subsequent confinement, do not interrupt the washout period under RCW 9.94A.525(2)(c). We reverse and remand to the trial court for resentencing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   FACTS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 2 A jury found Harold Marquette guilty of possession of a stolen vehicle. At sentencing, the State introduced documents showing 10 convictions prior to 2007 for class C felonies or equivalent crimes: 3 convictions for forgery (1988 and 1990), 2 Washington convictions for taking a motor vehicle without permission (1990), 1 conviction for second degree theft (1993), 1 conviction for attempting to elude a pursuing police vehicle (1994), 1 conviction for third degree assault of a child (1996), and 2 California convictions for taking a motor vehicle without permission (2001 and 2004).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 3 The State also introduced evidence that, following these 10 convictions, on May 4, 2007, Marquette pleaded guilty in Shasta County, California to 2 counts of lewd or lascivious acts with a child under 14 years old. The California court sentenced Marquette to 9 years of confinement. It granted him credit for 286 actual days in custody, plus 42 days for \"custody conduct credit.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 4 At sentencing in this case, the trial court determined that Marquette's 2007 California offenses of lewd and lascivious conduct could not be included in his Washington offender score. But, the court agreed with the State that the noncomparable California offense had \"resulted in conviction and ... significant incarceration,\" and therefore prevented washout of any of his previous offenses under RCW 9.94A.525(2)(c). The court therefore counted all 10 of the other felony convictions towards the offender score. Since the 4 convictions for taking a motor vehicle counted triple, his offender score was 18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   RCW 9.94A.525(20). The court sentenced Marquette to a standard range sentence of 56 months of confinement. Marquette appeals\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   DISCUSSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 5 The key issue in this case is whether an out-of-state conviction can prevent washout of a defendant's prior felony convictions under RCW 9.94A.525(2)(c). The issue is a question of statutory interpretation, which is a question of law this court reviews de novo.\n   <em>\n    State v. Ervin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4010698\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/169/815/#p820\">\n    169 Wash.2d 815\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 820,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=239%20P.3d%20354\">\n    239 P.3d 354\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2010).

That statute provides, in relevant part,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   [C]lass C prior felony convictions ... shall not be included in the offender score if, since the last date of release from confinement ... pursuant to a felony conviction, if any, or entry of judgment and sentence, the offender had spent five consecutive years in the community without committing any crime that subsequently results in a conviction.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   RCW 9.94A.525(2)(c). In construing this section, our courts have broken it down into two clauses: a \" 'trigger' \" clause, which identifies the beginning of the five year period, and a \" 'continuity/interruption' \" clause, which sets forth the substantive requirements an offender must satisfy during the five year period.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Ervin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4010698\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/169/815/#p820\">\n    169 Wash.2d at 821\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=239%20P.3d%20354\">\n    239 P.3d 354\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    In re Pers.

He argues that only an offense that is comparable to a Washington crime can interrupt the washout period for felonies under RCW 9.94A.525(2)(c). And, he asserts that, because his 2007 California conviction is not factually comparable to a Washington crime, the washout period for his earlier convictions ran from his 2007 release from felony confinement, and therefore he must be resentenced based on an offender score of zero.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 8 The State disagrees with Marquette's framing of the case. It does not address the \"continuity/interruption\" clause argument. Instead it argues the issue involves application of the \"trigger\" clause of the statute. The State asserts that the trigger date is Marquette's 2015 release from custody in California for the lewd or lascivious offense. It argues that, because Marquette was confined in California for over a year, this satisfies the definition of a felony in RCW 9A.04.040(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 9 It is the sole province of our state legislature to define criminal conduct in our state.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    McInturf v.

The plain language of this statute does not encompass crimes defined by the law of other states or federal law that are not crimes under Washington law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b6 10 By contrast, when the legislature was addressing scoring offenses not committed in Washington for purposes of sentencing, it specifically addressed how to treat out-of-state convictions and federal convictions:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   Out-of-state convictions for offenses shall be classified according to the comparable offense definitions and sentences provided by Washington law. Federal convictions for offenses shall be classified according to the comparable offense definitions and sentences provided by Washington law.

The court may rely on only facts that were admitted, stipulated, or proved to the fact finder beyond a reasonable doubt.\n   <em>\n    Lavery\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5629413\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/154/249/\">\n    154 Wash. 2d at 258\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=111%20P.3d%20837\">\n    111 P.3d 837\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The State concedes that Marquette's guilty plea did not include facts that would make the offense comparable to child molestation in Washington. And, at sentencing, the trial court agreed with Marquette that, under\n   <em>\n    Lavery\n   </em>\n   , it could not look beyond the facts acknowledged in the guilty plea. Thus, the second prong of the test was not satisfied either.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b6 13 The trial court applied that test and properly concluded that Marquette's 2007 lewd and lascivious conviction is not comparable to any Washington crime. But, the court then agreed with the State that the noncomparable California offense had \"resulted in conviction and ... significant incarceration,\" and therefore prevented washout of any of his previous offenses under RCW 9.94A.525(2)(c). This was error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b6 14 While the length of imprisonment referenced in RCW 9A.04.040(2) may make a crime a felony as opposed to a misdemeanor, the threshold question is whether the conduct is in fact a crime-a crime recognized under Washington law-not merely conduct that is criminal in nature. RCW 9A.04.040(1) ; RCW 9.94A.525(3). That determination is properly made under the comparability analysis. Under the comparability analysis, Marquette's crime in California was not a crime-let alone a felony crime-in Washington. Therefore, the State's argument that because Marquette's 2007 California conviction resulted in a sentence for more than a year, the underlying crime is a felony for purposes of the \"trigger\" clause, fails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b6 15 For the same reason, Marquette's argument, that the California offense is not comparable to a Washington crime and does not interrupt the washout period, is correct. The issue is addressed in\n   <em>\n    State v. Crocker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12461599\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-app/196/730/\">\n    196 Wash.

In\n   <em>\n    Crocker\n   </em>\n   , the defendant had an Oregon drug conviction from March 2000, and an Oregon offensive littering conviction from September 2009.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 733,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=385%20P.3d%20197\">\n    385 P.3d 197\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The issue was whether the defendant's 2009 Oregon offensive littering conviction prevented his 2000 drug conviction from washing out under RCW 9.94A.525(2)(c).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 734,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=385%20P.3d%20197\">\n    385 P.3d 197\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

When an out-of-state conviction is alleged to interrupt the washout period under RCW 9.94A.525(2)(c), the trial court must determine whether the out-of-state crime or conviction is legally or factually comparable to a Washington offense.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 736,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=385%20P.3d%20197\">\n    385 P.3d 197\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (alteration in original) (footnote omitted) (citation omitted) (quoting\n   <em>\n    State v.

Under the same reasoning, that crime is not a comparable Washington crime for purposes of the washout statute-for either the trigger clause or the continuity/interruption clause. It would be incongruous if only \"comparable\" out-of-state crimes are adequate to commence a washout period by virtue of the commission of a continuity/interruption \"crime\" (consistent with\n   <em>\n    Crocker\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Ervin\n   </em>\n   ), but a \"noncomparable\" out-of-state felony may trigger a washout period by virtue of a release from confinement pursuant to a \"felony conviction.\" As a result, the trial court erred in finding that the substantial incarceration of the noncomparable California conviction precluded washout under RCW 9.94A.525.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b6 17 Further, in supplemental briefing, Marquette argues that, because of his indigence, the trial court erred under\n   <em>\n    State v.
