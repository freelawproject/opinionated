We hold that the claim is impliedly preempted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 2 After injuring his hip years ago, Raymond R. Conklin, II experienced chronic pain. In 2008, a physician surgically implanted a Medtronic SynchroMed II 40 ml infusion pump and catheter (\"Pain Pump\") into Conklin to manage pain. Medtronic, Inc. and Medtronic Sofamor Danek USA, Inc. (collectively, \"Medtronic\") designed, manufactured, marketed, and sold the Pain Pump.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 3 Conklin underwent hip surgery in 2013 and in the aftermath suffered permanent injury allegedly caused by drug over-infusion from his continued use of the Pain Pump. Conklin and his wife sued Medtronic alleging several common law tort claims, including both strict liability and negligence claims for failure to provide adequate and timely warnings. In those claims Conklin alleged that before his 2013 injury, the FDA sent warning letters to Medtronic, advising it that the Pain Pump was adulterated and misbranded and stating that Medtronic had failed to report adverse events to the FDA after the FDA approved the Pain Pump in its pre-market approval (\"PMA\") process. Conklin also alleged that before his 2013 injury, the FDA issued two recalls of the Pain Pump regarding the unintentional injection or cessation of drugs, and that after his injury the FDA issued another recall relating to the Pain Pump's unintended delivery of drugs that could result in a drug overdose. Conklin further alleged that Medtronic's failure to report post-PMA adverse events to the FDA in violation of federal law gives rise to liability under Arizona common law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 4 Medtronic moved to dismiss the claims under Arizona Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), arguing that all Conklin's claims are expressly and impliedly preempted under federal law. The superior court agreed and dismissed the action against Medtronic with prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 5 The court of appeals affirmed in part, upholding on preemption grounds the dismissal of Conklin's product liability and negligence claims based on alleged design and manufacturing defects, as well as the claim for breach of express warranty.\n   <em>\n    Conklin v.

But even if \u00a7 388 applied, it would not change the result. First, that section has not been extended to require a manufacturer to submit warnings to a governmental regulatory body.
