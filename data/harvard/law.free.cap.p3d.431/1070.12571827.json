He contends that he was deprived of the right to a jury trial because the trial court concluded as a threshold matter that his prior two convictions for reckless driving were qualifying \"prior offenses.\" Alternatively, Wu argues that even if the trial court had authority to make the threshold determination, there was insufficient evidence to demonstrate the prior offenses involved drugs or alcohol. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b6 3 On August 1, 2016, a Washington State Trooper conducted a traffic stop after observing a truck driven by Wu weaving between lanes on I-5. Wu was alone in the driver's seat and had bloodshot watery eyes. Wu's speech was thick and he had difficulty retrieving his registration. Wu agreed to attempt a field sobriety test but performed very poorly. Wu was arrested and transported to the police station. Wu submitted two breath samples with a breath alcohol content (BAC) of 0.072 and 0.068 respectively.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 4 The State charged Wu with felony DUI, violating an ignition lock requirement, and driving with a suspended license.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The felony DUI charge was based on the State's claim that Wu had four \"prior offenses\" under RCW 46.61.502(6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 5 The trial court granted Wu's motion to bifurcate the trial. The first phase of trial determined whether Wu was guilty of DUI for the August 1, 2016, arrest. The jury found Wu guilty of DUI.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 6 The second phase of trial determined whether Wu had four prior offenses within 10 years which would elevate the DUI to a felony DUI and whether Wu was guilty of driving with a suspended license.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 7 During the second phase of trial, the State offered evidence of the following four prior convictions:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   \u2022 April 29, 2014, conviction by the Marysville Municipal Court for first degree negligent driving, based on a September 29, 2013 citation for DUI.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   \u2022 October 13, 2015, conviction by the Snohomish County District Court for reckless driving based on an October 9, 2013, citation for DUI.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   \u2022 July 22, 2015, conviction by the Snohomish County District Court for DUI based on an October 15, 2013, citation for DUI.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   \u2022 March 29, 2016, conviction by the Marysville Municipal Court for reckless driving based on a May 2, 2015, citation for DUI.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 8 After the State rested, Wu moved to dismiss the felony DUI charge on the grounds that the State presented no evidence that Wu's two prior convictions for reckless driving involved alcohol or drugs. After reviewing the evidence supporting the four convictions and relevant case law, the trial court concluded that each of the prior convictions involved the use of alcohol and denied Wu's motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 9 Wu then unsuccessfully proposed a jury instruction that would have required the State to prove that a \"prior offense\" was related to alcohol or drugs beyond a reasonable doubt. The trial court declined Wu's proposed instruction because it had already found that Wu's prior offenses involved alcohol.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 10 The jury found that Wu had four or more \"prior offenses\" within 10 years of August 1, 2016. The trial court sentenced Wu to 23 months of confinement on the DUI count and 90 days for driving with a suspended license. Wu appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 11 Wu's primary contention is that the State must prove to a jury, beyond a reasonable doubt, that each of the four prior convictions used to elevate a gross misdemeanor DUI to a felony DUI meet the statutory definition of a \"prior offense.\" Wu contends that our Supreme Court's opinion in\n   <em>\n    City of Walla Walla v.

This is an important difference from Mullen's case because Greene was convicted beyond a reasonable doubt of an alcohol- or drug-related offense. Mullen, in contrast, pleaded guilty to a non-alcohol- or non-drug-related prior offense, reckless driving, which the State now seeks to use to convict him of a more serious alcohol- or drug-related offense.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   <em>\n    Mullen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4174356\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-app/186/321/\">\n    186 Wash.

First, it creates a dubious template for the drafting of future statutes. For example, the State's reasoning would support a \"three strikes\" statute that counted a prior conviction for shoplifting as a strike merely because it was initially filed as a robbery. Second, allowing the State's initial accusation to serve as proof creates an incentive\n   to overcharge and then amend to a lesser charge that can be proved.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   \u00b6 38 The majority relies on a line of cases holding that the fact of a prior conviction is a threshold question for the judge to decide.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Bird\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4235639\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-app/187/942/#p945\">\n    187 Wash.

They do not address the unique definition of \"prior offense\" that allows a prior conviction for reckless driving to be used for enhancement based solely on how it was originally charged, regardless of whether drugs or alcohol were involved. Because the predicate offenses were all prior DUI convictions,\n   <em>\n    Greene\n   </em>\n   was not discussed. Like the first degree negligent driving conviction in\n   <em>\n    Greene\n   </em>\n   , a DUI conviction inherently establishes the use of alcohol or drugs that is why Wu does not challenge the use of his two prior DUI convictions. The issue here is what the State must additionally prove when the predicate offense does\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   inherently establish the use of alcohol or drugs and its admissibility for enhancement depends on what charge the State originally filed. That issue was not present in\n   <em>\n    Cochrane\n   </em>\n   or\n   <em>\n    Chambers\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   \u00b6 44 The additional fact necessary to make a prior reckless driving conviction qualify as a \"prior offense\" can be established by jury fact-finding, as the defendant proposed in\n   <em>\n    Mullen\n   </em>\n   and as Wu proposed in the present case. Or in some cases it can be determined by the court as a matter of law, but only if the record of that prior conviction shows that the defendant stipulated or admitted to involvement of drugs or alcohol.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Pers.

Here, the trial court did not submit the issue to the jury. And the documents with which the State attempted to establish admissibility of the two \"prior offenses\" of reckless driving did not include Wu's stipulation or admission to drug or alcohol involvement. The documents merely showed that the reckless driving convictions were originally filed as DUIs. Filing a charge is only an accusation.
