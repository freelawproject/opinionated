The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of City Light after concluding that Gamble failed to establish a prima facie case for a failure to reasonably accommodate. We affirm the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 2 Gamble began working for the City of Seattle (City) as a laborer in 1987. In 1989, Gamble suffered a work related back injury. By 1996, the injury had worsened to where Gamble could no longer work as a laborer. Gamble transferred to a position as an Electrical Service Representative (representative) with City Light, a public utility and department of the City. As a representative, Gamble provided customer service support to City Light's customers while working out of City Light's South Service Center in the SODO/Georgetown area.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 3 To accommodate her back injury, Gamble's then manager, Bryan Leuschen, provided her with a standing desk, rubber floor mat, and padded seat cushions for her work vehicle. Leuschen also allowed Gamble to work a \"four ten\" schedule,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   which allowed her to have every Wednesday off, and allowed her to work a part time flex schedule after she underwent an unrelated surgery.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 4 In 2012, Leuschen retired and Jon Trout became Gamble's permanent supervisor. From August through December 2012, Trout occasionally asked Gamble to work out of the City Light's North Service Center. Then, in December 2012, Trout asked Gamble to assist an overburdened senior representative by covering Seattle's Queen Anne and Magnolia neighborhoods, out of the North Center.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 5 On February 26, 2013, Gamble was almost in a motor vehicle collision while driving a City Light vehicle. The event caused her to hurt her shoulder and aggravate her back. As a result, Gamble went on medical leave from February 27, 2013 through July 1, 2013.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 6 In 2015, Gamble sued City Light alleging, among other things, that it had failed to reasonably accommodate her disability in violation of the WLAD. Gamble alleged that City Light failed to accommodate her by removing her standing work station, and by failing to provide her with a rubber mat at the North Center. Gamble also alleged that meetings and work duties were scheduled at times and places that required her to drive more than was necessary. Further, Gamble alleged that after her 2013 medical leave City Light failed to allow her to work a four ten schedule, prevented her from returning to work on a part time flex schedule, and refused to let her work from home. Finally, Gamble alleged that City Light refused to let her switch her day off on one particular incident so that she could attend a doctor's appointment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 7 Before trial, Gamble moved for summary judgment on her failure to accommodate claim. The City responded with a cross motion for summary judgment. The trial court denied Gamble's motion and granted the City's motion. Gamble's other claims then went to a jury, who returned a verdict in favor of the City on all counts. Gamble appeals the trial court's grant of the City's motion for summary judgment, denial of her\n   motion for summary judgment, and denial of her motion for reconsideration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 8 We review decisions on summary judgment de novo.\n   <em>\n    Michak v.

It is the latter two of these requirements that are lacking.

When Gamble was temporarily transferred to the North Center she told Trout that she required a standing work station. While Trout did not respond to her request with the speed that Gamble desired, she contacted the facilities department herself and City Light provided her a standing work station.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b6 16 City Light also appropriately accommodated Gamble's request for a part-time schedule after returning from medical leave. On Monday June 24, 2013, Gamble contacted City Light and asked if she could return to work part time that Tuesday, June 25, and Thursday, June 27, and then full time the following week.

It was unreasonable for Gamble to contact City Light after being on medical leave for months and expect to be accommodated the next day. Trout did not deny her request for accommodation but instead informed her that he would be able to accommodate her request the next week. Gamble chose to return to work full time the following week, and was able to do so without incident. This was not a failure to accommodate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   B.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote                id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b6 18 For the majority of Gamble's allegations, she failed to properly put City Light on notice of her need for accommodations. Gamble argues that because City Light and Leuschen were on notice of her disability since 1996, that this notice was imputed to Trout in 2012.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kimbro v. Atl.

We agree. But here the relevant issue is not whether City Light was on notice of Gamble's disability but rather whether City Light was on notice that her previous accommodations were no longer reasonably accommodating her disability. City Light's knowledge of Gamble's disability does not relieve Gamble of her duty to inform City Light that her accommodations were lacking.\n  </blockquote               >\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   An employer must be able to ascertain whether its efforts at accommodation have\n   been effective in order to determine whether more is required to discharge its duty. The employee therefore has a duty to communicate to the employer whether the accommodation was effective. This duty flows from the mutual obligations of the interactive process. To hold otherwise would be inequitable to the employer and would undercut the statute's goal of keeping the employee with the impairment on the job.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <em>\n    Frisino v.

In fact, she testified that she never asked anyone for a rubber mat because \"a little floor mat was not worth bothering anyone about.\" Gamble also never discussed with Trout how her work schedule was affecting her back. To the contrary, she testified that on the days that she was at work she was never forced to miss a work requirement because of her back.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b6 21 Similarly, Gamble never asked for permission to work from home as an accommodation. Gamble testified at her deposition that she asked Trout permission to work from home in order to have \"more quiet time and private time to do\" her work.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   And Leuschen only allowed Gamble to work from home occasionally. He explained, \"We did a little experiment ... I didn't approve a full 8 hours of work at home; she was able to be productive for 2-4 hours [and] had to come in for supervision.\" The trial court noted: \"She was never told she could work at home. She was told she could work on occasion ... but her job is a face-to-face job.\" Therefore, Gamble did not put City Light on notice that she needed to work from home as an accommodation for her disability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b6 22 Gamble alleged that City Light failed to allow her to adjust her schedule for a doctor's appointment. Gamble asked Trout if she could switch her day off from Wednesday, October 3 to Friday, October 5, but did not specify this was because of a doctor's appointment. Trout asked Gamble to keep her regular day off because a training had previously been scheduled for October 5 that Gamble, as the training supervisor, was supposed to lead. One of Gamble's duties as a supervising representative includes \"planning and directing employee training.\" Gamble agreed to keep her scheduled day off, but then took a sick day on October 5 anyway. Gamble never notified City Light that she required the schedule change to accommodate her disability or because she had a doctor's appointment that day, and she took October 5th off in any event.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   C.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b6 23 Gamble's allegation that City Light failed to reasonably accommodate her\n   by preventing her from working a four ten schedule requires a separate analysis. Before Gamble left on medical leave, Gamble was allowed to work a four ten schedule. When viewed in the light most favorable to Gamble, this schedule was offered to her as an accommodation. While Gamble was on leave, City Light changed its policy and no longer allowed anyone to work four tens. Gamble's four ten schedule was the only accommodation that was at least arguably removed. However, neither Gamble nor City Light discussed the sufficiency of the new schedule or whether it reasonably accommodated Gamble. Therefore, the question becomes whose duty it was to discuss the sufficiency of Gamble's new schedule with the other.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b6 24 In\n   <em>\n    Frisino\n   </em>\n   , this court analyzed whether a school district's trial and error process of finding appropriate accommodation was reasonable.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4012869\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-app/160/765/#p783\">\n    160 Wash.App. at 779\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=249%20P.3d%201044\">\n    249 P.3d 1044\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court noted that the employee had the burden to communicate with the employer because \"determining whether the accommodation[s] w[ere] effective turned on information in [the employee's] control.\"\n   <em>\n    Frisino\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4012869\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-app/160/765/#p783\">\n    160 Wash.App. at 783\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=249%20P.3d%201044\">\n    249 P.3d 1044\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b6 25 Here, upon returning from leave, Gamble requested to work the new schedule which allowed for one day off every two weeks: \"I understand that we are no longer working 4/10's so I would like the [new] schedule with alternating Wednesdays off.\" City Light granted her request. Therefore, as far as City Light knew, Gamble's new schedule was precisely the accommodation that she desired. Had this schedule been insufficient that was information solely in Gamble's control.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \u00b6 26 In\n   <em>\n    Conneen v. MBNA America Bank, N.A.\n   </em>\n   , the Third Circuit analyzed a similar situation under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1530133\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/334/318/\">\n    334 F.3d 318\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (3rd Cir. 2003). There, Conneen suffered from a disability that made it difficult for her to arrive at work on time, and MBNA accommodated her by allowing her to work an adjusted schedule. MBNA later came under the impression that Conneen no longer required her accommodation. Upon the removal of her accommodation, Conneen did not inform MBNA that her disability remained or that she still require the adjusted schedule.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Conneen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1530133\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/334/318/\">\n    334 F.3d at 321-24\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In affirming the trial court's grant of summary judgment in favor of MBNA, the Third Circuit noted that \"neither the law nor common sense can demand clairvoyance of an employer.\"\n   <em>\n    Conneen,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1530133\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/334/318/\">\n    334 F.3d at 331\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00b6 27\n   <em>\n    Conneen\n   </em>\n   is similar to Gamble's situation. In\n   <em>\n    Conneen\n   </em>\n   , the employee was previously accommodated but when her accommodations were removed she failed to inform her employer of an issue.\n   <em>\n    Conneen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1530133\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/334/318/\">\n    334 F.3d at 321\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Similarly, here, Gamble's four ten accommodation was removed but Gamble never told City Light that this was an issue. In\n   <em>\n    Conneen\n   </em>\n   , MBNA \"had every reason to believe that the [disability] no longer existed ... and [Conneen] did nothing to inform [MBNA] that it did.\"\n   <em>\n    Conneen,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1530133\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/334/318/\">\n    334 F.3d at 331\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Further, \"once [MBNA] threatened to withdraw the accommodation, [Conneen] remained silent. [She] never contacted [her doctor], and never notified [MBNA] of her condition.\"\n   <em>\n    Conneen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1530133\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/334/318/\">\n    334 F.3d at 333\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Similarly here, City Light had every reason to believe that the new schedule was reasonably accommodating Gamble and she did not put City Light on notice that it was insufficient.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00b6 28 The burden fell to Gamble to inform City Light that she required a four ten schedule as an accommodation for her disability. Not only did Gamble fail to inform City Light that her new schedule was negatively impacting her disability, but she specifically requested the new schedule. Therefore, City Light did not violate the WLAD by failing to provide Gamble with a four ten schedule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b6 29 We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <footnote                  id=\"p-46\">\n   WE CONCUR:\n  </footnote                 >\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-51\">\n    A four ten schedule allows an employee to work four days per week with ten hour shifts each day.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-52\">\n    While this schedule benefitted Gamble's medical condition it is not clear if it was officially offered to her as an accommodation because everyone who worked for Gamble's unit was allowed to work four tens.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-53\">\n    Or alternatively, that medical documentation established a reasonable likelihood that engaging in her job without an accommodation would create a substantially limiting effect.
