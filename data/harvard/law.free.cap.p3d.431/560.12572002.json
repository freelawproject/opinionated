Almost a year after L-MHB had been removed from their home, TC and GC filed a petition in district court to adopt her.

DFS argued that the district court could not grant the petition because DFS did not relinquish custody of L-MHB, L-MHB did not live with TC and GC when they filed the petition, and TC and GC did not file the required medical report for L-MHB. Soon after, the mother filed her answer to the petition. She asserted that she was willing to sign a consent to the adoption, but only if TC and GC were the \"adoptive family.\" TC and GC argued that they only needed the mother's consent to the adoption because her parental rights had not been terminated, and thus, she retained the right to consent to the adoption pursuant to her residual parental rights under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wyo.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2014-3-402\">\n    Wyo.

Finally, the court agreed that the petition was not in \"substantial compliance with the statute\" because TC and GC failed to file a medical report for L-MHB with their petition.
