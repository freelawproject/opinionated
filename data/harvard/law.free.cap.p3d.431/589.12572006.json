Ball Revocable Trust (the Trust) challenges the trial court's determination that it lacked standing to pursue derivative claims on behalf of Phoenix Orchard Group I, L.P. and Phoenix Orchard Group II, L.P. (collectively, POG) after its partnership interests in the entities were rescinded. In this Opinion, we adopt the continuous ownership rule, which requires a plaintiff in a derivative action to continue to possess an interest in the entity on whose behalf it sues throughout the litigation. Because the Trust no longer has any interest in POG, it lacks standing to pursue its derivative claims. Accordingly, we affirm the court's order dismissing the Trust's claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 2 In 2006, the Trust bought limited partnership interests in POG. Nine years later, the Trust sued POG and related parties,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   alleging violations of the Arizona Securities Act.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ariz. Rev. Stat. (A.R.S.) \u00a7\u00a7 44-1801\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   to -2126. Within its complaint, the Trust demanded either rescission of its investments or damages, and tendered the securities to POG.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   A.R.S. \u00a7 44-2001(A) (stating a fraudulent sale of securities \"is voidable at the election of the purchaser\"). In its answer, POG accepted the tender and counterclaimed for a declaration that the rescission was valid and complete.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 3 In January 2016, the Trust filed a separate limited partnership derivative action on behalf of POG, alleging other partners and participants had breached the partnership agreements and the offering documents by making various payments \"that appeared to be not allowed within the offering documents or partnership agreements.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   A.R.S. \u00a7 29-356. A few months later, the trial court approved the rescission of the Trust's investment in POG and entered final judgment on the Trust's fraud claims in the first case, which was later affirmed by this Court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Judson C. Ball Revocable Tr. v. Phx. Orchard Grp. I, L.P.\n   </em>\n   , 1 CA-CV 16-0557,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%20283049\">\n    2018 WL 283049\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Ariz. App. Jan. 4, 2018) (mem. decision). POG then intervened in the derivative action and moved to dismiss on the ground that the Trust was no longer a partner and therefore lacked standing to pursue the derivative claims. After conducting a detailed analysis of relevant authorities, the court agreed and dismissed the complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 4 The Trust timely appealed a final judgment entered pursuant to Arizona Rule of Civil Procedure 54(b). We have jurisdiction pursuant to A.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 12-120.21(A)(1) and -2101(A)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 5 The Trust had standing to file the derivative claims because it was a limited partner in POG at the time it filed its complaint. The only issue on appeal is whether the Trust lost its standing after its partnership interests were rescinded. Whether a\n   party has standing presents a question of law subject to\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   review.\n   <em>\n    Home Builders Ass'n of Cent. Ariz. v.

The Trust points out that Rule 23.1(b) was amended in 2017 to eliminate language specifying that a \"derivative action may not be maintained if it appears that the plaintiff does not fairly and adequately represent the interests of the shareholders or members similarly situated in enforcing the right of the corporation or association.\" In the absence of this language in the current rule, the Trust contends it need only prove it was a limited partner of POG when it\n   <em>\n    filed\n   </em>\n   the derivative complaint. Appellees, on the other hand, urge us to join the majority of jurisdictions that have adopted a \"continuous ownership\" requirement as a matter of common law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b6 8 As an initial matter, we do not agree that the recent elimination of the express \"fairly and adequately represent\" language from Rule 23.1(b) mandates rejection of the continuous ownership rule in Arizona. The current version of Rule 23.1(b) states that a derivative complaint must \"allege facts sufficient to show that the plaintiff satisfies all statutory and other requirements under the law for maintaining the derivative action.\" The current rule's acknowledgement of requirements other than those imposed by statute affords room for application of well-reasoned common law principles where appropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b6 9 A derivative action, by its very nature, challenges the power of the entity's management.\n   <em>\n    Ala.
