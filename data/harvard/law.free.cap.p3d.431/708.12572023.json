Mukadin Gordon (\"Gordon\") filed suit because he was held in solitary confinement by State of Hawai'i (\"State\") prison officials for more than nine months following his arrest in August 2010. Gordon requested monetary damages pursuant to Title 42, Section 1983 of the United States Code (\"U.S.C.\") and state tort law. Following a jury-waived trial, the Circuit Court of the First Circuit (\"circuit court\")\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   entered judgment in favor of the defendants on all claims. The Intermediate Court of Appeals (\"ICA\") affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   We hold that Gordon's placement in solitary confinement for more than nine months constituted unlawful pretrial punishment in violation of the due process clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article I, Section 5 of the Constitution of the State of Hawai'i. We also hold, however, that although the circuit court applied an incorrect standard for federal qualified immunity, defendant Petra Cho (\"Cho\") is not liable for damages under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   for the federal constitutional violation because the basis of her decision to retain Gordon in pretrial solitary confinement did not violate a clearly established constitutional right of which every reasonable official would have known. We also hold the circuit court did not err by concluding Cho has no negligence liability based on state qualified immunity principles. In addition, as the State has not waived sovereign immunity for damages claims based on state constitutional violations, the State is not liable for damages for the state constitutional violation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   We therefore overrule the ICA's memorandum opinion insofar as it conflicts with our conclusions herein, but affirm the ICA's judgment on appeal in favor of the defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Circuit Court Pretrial Proceedings\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Gordon filed a civil complaint arising from his pretrial detention at the Oahu Community Correctional Center (\"OCCC\") and the Halawa Correctional Facility (\"HCF\"). He alleged he was incorrectly classified as a maximum security pretrial detainee and placed in solitary confinement for a total of nine months and twenty-two days between 2010 and 2011.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In this opinion, we address only the claims asserted by Gordon in his amended complaint against Cho and the State (collectively, \"the Defendants\") that he continues to assert on appeal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Through his first cause of action,\n   Gordon alleges a\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   claim for violation of his right to due process under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution against Cho; he also alleges a violation of his right to due process under Article I, Section 5 of the Constitution of the State of Hawai'i against the State. Through his fourth cause of action, he alleges negligence against Cho. Gordon seeks general, special, and punitive damages, attorneys' fees and costs, and such other relief as deemed appropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Circuit Court Trial\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The circuit court conducted a two-day jury-waived/bench trial that decided Gordon's federal\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   claim against Cho in her individual capacity and his state negligence claim against Cho.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    1. The circuit court's findings of fact\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The circuit court found the following facts relevant to the issues on certiorari.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    a. Gordon's pretrial detention\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On August 22, 2010, Gordon was arrested on charges of seven counts of sexual assault in the first degree, one count of attempted sexual assault in the first degree, four counts of sexual assault in the third degree, one count of promoting prostitution, and one count of kidnapping in the first degree. From August 26, 2010, to June 16, 2011, Gordon was held in maximum security custody at OCCC and HCF while he awaited trial on his criminal case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    b. Initial custody classification and conditions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On August 26, 2010, Department of Public Safety (''DPS'') employee Faatuila Pula (\"Pula\") conducted Gordon's initial intake interview at OCCC and filled out a Jail Initial Custody Instrument (''Initial Custody Instrument'') to determine his custody status. This document was completed using information from the Hawai'i Criminal Justice Inquiry System, the National Crime Information Center, and a brief interview with Gordon.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   After completing the Initial Custody Instrument, Pula determined that Gordon had a total of nineteen ''points'' and accordingly classified Gordon as a maximum custody detainee.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Based on this custody classification, Gordon was placed in maximum security custody in the OCCC Holding Unit for thirty days. While there, Gordon was alone in a small cell for twenty-three hours per day, had limited access to showers and reading materials, and was not permitted any phone calls. Gordon requested mental health services during the one-month detainment in the OCCC Holding Unit, but was never provided with any.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    c. September 2010 custody evaluation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On September 22, 2010, an administrative program committee (\"the Committee\") conducted a hearing to further evaluate Gordon's security custody classification, programming needs, and whether housing at OCCC was appropriate for him. Cho, a DPS correctional supervisor, was the Committee's chairperson.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   When evaluating an inmate's security classification and housing needs, the Committee can consider \"all aspects regarding an inmate,\" including the inmate's institutional\n   file, current charges, prior convictions, and the inmate's own testimony. Accordingly, Cho and the Committee considered Gordon's own statements that he did not think he should be a maximum custody detainee, had done reasonably well at OCCC, and that there was an error concerning his initial custody classification because it was based in part on charges that were not actually pending.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The Committee decided, however, that Gordon should remain at the maximum custody level and should be housed at HCF High Security. It notified him of this decision in a written document designated as an \"Amended Notice of Programming Results\" (\"Programming Results\"). The Programming Results acknowledged that Gordon had \"not received any major misconducts\" since being admitted to OCCC. However, Cho and the Committee decided that Gordon should remain as a maximum custody detainee, in solitary confinement, for the following reasons:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   - The nature and seriousness of his current charges;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   - The number and kind of his prior convictions;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   - His extensive criminal history and numerous periods of incarceration;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   - His failure to comply with two residential drug treatment programs;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   - Leaving the state without permission while on probation;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   - His extradition to Hawaii;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   - The fact that [Gordon] was on probation when charged with his current offenses;\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   - His $1,000,000.00 bail amount; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   - [O]ther factors identified in the committee's Amended Notice of Programming Results.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Additionally, the Committee noted Gordon's probation status, unpaid restitution amounts, and the opinion of his probation officer that his case was \"questionable.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Committee provided final comments explaining its decision:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   The Committee concurs with [the Initial Custody Instrument] that classified Mr. GORDON as MAX and also recommends that he be housed accordingly at Halawa High Security. The Committee deems MR. GORDON a high-risk inmate and also, a high flight risk. OCCC is inappropriate housing for Mr. GORDON because OCCC is not able to provide MR. GORDON with the high degree of direct supervision that he requires.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   According to Cho, an inmate classified as maximum security \"needs more direct supervision\" by correctional officers, especially when outside of his or her cell, and the Committee felt that OCCC was unable to provide the level of supervision required for Gordon. In evaluating his custody status, Cho never harbored malice or ill-will toward Gordon and did not believe Gordon was punished when he was placed in maximum custody conditions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Gordon filed a grievance challenging the Committee's decision on September 29, 2010.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    d. October 2010 Exception Case Form\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   On October 5, 2010, Cho received a memorandum from her supervisor, Lance Rabacal (\"Rabacal\"). The memorandum instructed Cho to \"adhere to the directive process that has been consistently utilized at our facility pertaining to MAX custody inmates,\" which was attached. That memorandum, originally written by a former OCCC warden in November 1996, laid out the State's \"arrangement with the ACLU\" (\"ACLU Memo\") regarding procedures for processing maximum custody pretrial detainees. The ACLU Memo provided that pretrial detainees classified as maximum custody \"shall be housed in the [OCCC] Holding Unit for 30 days,\" and \"[i]f the inmate remains misconduct free and is not a management problem, OCCC shall then reduce the inmate's custody to Medium and re-house in general population.\" It also provided that \"if the inmate incurs misconducts during the 30-day period, and/or is a management problem, he shall be transferred to HCF as a Max custody.\" According to Rabacal, the ACLU Memo was \"used as a guideline to determine when a recommendation to reduce custody\" should be considered.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   On or about October 12, 2010, an Exception Case Form was started for Gordon under Cho's name. This form noted that Gordon had \"not shown nor accrued any institutional behavioral misconducts within the OCCC holding unit\" and recommended a medium custody classification \"[b]ased on 10/5/10 OCCC MAX CUSTODY INMATES directive from Lance Rabacal.\" The Exception Case Form was sent to the DPS Classification Office, which considers the totality of the circumstances when making the decision to reduce or maintain an inmate's custody level.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Linda Chun (\"Chun\"), an officer in the Classification Office, denied Gordon's Exception Case Form on October 19, 2010. Chun recorded the reasoning for her decision on the Exception Case Form itself, noting Gordon's behavior in the OCCC Holding Unit had been satisfactory thus far, but explaining that she thought he should remain in maximum custody for the following reasons:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   [T]his case still presents a number of risk factors. Current charges are serious &amp; violent in nature. As a result, subject has a high bail amount. Subject has an extensive criminal history &amp; also has had numerous periods of incarceration. Subject has failed to profit from previous experience with probation and incarceration. Substance abuse issues have not been addressed due to subject's discharge from program for non-compliance with program rules.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Chun believed, based on her training, experience, and the reasons she cited, that it was reasonable to place a pretrial detainee in maximum security housing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The disapproved Exception Case Form was submitted to Deputy Director of Corrections Tommy Johnson (\"Johnson\") for review. On October 21, 2010, Johnson denied Gordon's request because he believed Chun's statements on the Exception Case Form were true, although he had no personal knowledge of the basis for the statements. Johnson did not believe Gordon's custody level was punishment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    e. Subsequent grievances and conditions at HCF\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   From September 29, 2010, through March 24, 2011, Gordon filed eight Inmate Complaint/Grievances challenging his classification and placement in solitary confinement. Gordon sought reclassification to medium custody and transfer to OCCC, but none of his grievances were granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Gordon was transferred to HCF on October 25, 2010, and was placed in maximum custody. As a pretrial detainee at HCF, he was alone in his cell for twenty-three hours per day, was given forty-five minutes to an hour of recreational time five days a week, had no access to a shower on weekends, and was only allowed noncontact visits with his attorney. He was strip searched daily and searched again each time he returned to his cell. Gordon had limited access to phone calls, did not have access to a commissary, and was denied access to programs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   According to Monica Lortz (\"Lortz\"), an HCF Corrections Supervisor, DPS policy requires the custody status of every maximum\n   custody inmate, whether pretrial detainee or sentenced prisoner, to be reassessed once a year. In June 2011, at the instruction of the deputy warden and after Gordon had been at HCF for eight months, Lortz reevaluated Gordon's custody status using a Jail Inmate Custody Review Instrument (\"Custody Review Instrument\"). After completing the Custody Review Instrument, Lortz assigned Gordon a total of thirteen points, which corresponded to a medium custody level.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Gordon's custody level was therefore reduced from maximum to medium, and he was returned to OCCC on June 16, 2011.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   After Gordon was sentenced for his pending charges in September 2011, he was returned to HCF.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   At the time of the trial in his civil case, Gordon was held at HCF in medium security custody.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <strong>\n    2. The circuit court's conclusions of law\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The circuit court rendered the following conclusions of law relevant to the issues on certiorari.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <strong>\n    a. Gordon's\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n    </extracted-citation>\n    claim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Citing the United States Supreme Court's opinion in\n   <em>\n    Bell\n   </em>\n   , the circuit court stated that pre-trial detainees have a substantive due process right against custodial restrictions that amount to punishment, but also that not every condition imposed during pretrial detention amounts to punishment. To determine whether a condition is punishment, the circuit court determined that it must look to whether the restrictions evince a punitive purpose or intent, and in the absence of an express intent to punish, it must then consider whether punitive intent can be inferred from the nature of the restriction. The circuit court further noted that whether punitive intent can be inferred generally turns upon whether an alternative purpose to which the restriction may rationally be connected is assignable for it, and whether the restriction appears excessive in relation to the alternative purpose assigned to it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The circuit court concluded that Gordon's constitutional rights were not violated based on the lack of substantive evidence showing that Defendants categorized him as a maximum custody pre-trial detainee purely to impose punishment upon him. Furthermore, the circuit court concluded the conditions to which Gordon was subject as a maximum custody detainee were \"reasonably related to a legitimate government objective which is to maintain a safe and secure correctional facility,\" and were no different from the restrictions and conditions of any other maximum custody inmates. The circuit court also concluded that Gordon did not prove \"that the conditions of maximum custody imposed by Defendants to maintain a safe and secure correctional facility were excessive to accomplish such objective nor expressly intended as punishment,\" and that \"the restrictions and conditions [Gordon] was subjected to did not amount to punishment.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Determining that Cho complied with the guidelines of the ACLU Memo, the circuit court also concluded that Cho was entitled to qualified immunity from Gordon's\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   claims \"because she did not knowingly violate [Gordon's] Constitutional rights\" and Gordon did not suffer punishment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <strong>\n    b. Gordon's negligence claim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   The circuit court determined that \"Cho, individually, is afforded the protections of a qualified privilege as to [Gordon]'s state law claims because [Gordon] did not prove by clear and convincing evidence that Defendant Cho was motivated by malice and not by an otherwise proper purpose.\" Accordingly, the circuit court ordered judgment to be entered for Cho.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <strong>\n    C. ICA Proceedings\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   On appeal, Gordon challenged the circuit court's findings and conclusions that (1) Gordon's initial custody classification was correct; (2) the conditions to which he was subjected did not constitute punishment; (3) the Defendants acted reasonably in their application of their classification procedure; and (4) Cho was entitled to qualified immunity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   In a memorandum opinion, the ICA affirmed the circuit court's judgment.\n   <em>\n    Gordon v. Maesaka-Hirata\n   </em>\n   , No. CAAP-14-914,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12313597,12313605,12313589\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/140/2/\">\n    140 Hawai'i 2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%202364734\">\n    2017 WL 2364734\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (App. May 30, 2017) (mem. op.) at 2, 28. The ICA noted that in deciding to keep Gordon in maximum security custody, Cho and the Committee, as well as Chun in the Classification Office, relied on factors such as \"the nature of the current charges, bail amount, criminal history, failure to complete probation, and unaddressed substance abuse issues[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Gordon\n   </em>\n   , mem. op. at 19-20. The ICA concluded that these factors, among other things, provided \"substantial evidence [to] support ... the Circuit Court's conclusion that the individual prison officials acted reasonably in keeping Gordon in Max Custody.\"\n   <em>\n    Gordon\n   </em>\n   , mem. op. at 19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   The ICA acknowledged that \"while Gordon has no constitutional right to a certain classification, he possesses a right to be free from punishment prior to an adjudication of guilt.\"\n   <em>\n    Gordon\n   </em>\n   , mem. op. at 23. \"[O]n the totality of the record of this case,\" the ICA concluded that the circuit court did not err \"in determining that Gordon's Max Custody did not constitute pre-trial punishment.\"\n   <em>\n    Gordon\n   </em>\n   , mem. op. at 20. In the ICA's view, \"Gordon cite[d] no evidence or legal authority that his Max Custody classification constituted punishment\" and \"the evidence led to the conclusion that the conditions were reasonably related to legitimate government objectives related to the safety and security of the correctional facilities and that they were not excessive for that purpose.\"\n   <em>\n    Gordon\n   </em>\n   , mem. op. at 19-20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   The ICA determined Gordon did not show evidence of punitive intent and failed to show there was no alternative reason for his treatment other than punishment, or that his treatment was excessive in relation to its alternative purpose.\n   <em>\n    Gordon\n   </em>\n   , mem. op. at 24. The ICA also observed that Gordon \"failed to establish that the procedure detailed in the ACLU Memo is guaranteed to him\" or that it otherwise overrides the deference owed to prison officials.\n   <em>\n    Gordon\n   </em>\n   , mem. op. at 24-25. The ICA concluded, instead, that \"[t]he reasons for keeping Gordon in Max Custody were clearly articulated and appear to be\n   related to the legitimate nonpunitive governmental objective of security and safety.

We conclude Cho's treatment of Gordon was not reasonably related to a legitimate, nonpunitive government interest, and therefore was punishment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Among other things, Gordon asserts his treatment was arbitrary because his initial custody level was based on inaccurate information, which Cho failed to correct, and also because Cho failed to follow the dictates of the ACLU Memo. With respect to the ACLU Memo, the circuit court concluded that \"by submitting the Exception Form, ... Cho did comply with the guidelines of the [ACLU] Max Custody Memo.\" The ACLU Memo, however, does not characterize itself as a \"guideline\" and does not address Exception Case Forms or approval by the Classification Office; instead, it plainly instructs OCCC Holding Unit staff to (1) house all new inmates classified as maximum custody in the Holding Unit for thirty days; and (2) reduce the inmate's custody status to medium and return that inmate to the OCCC general population \"[i]f the inmate remains misconduct free and is not a management problem[.]\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   Cho's testimony at trial was that she actually did not know the ACLU Memo existed when the Committee met to review Gordon's custody status, although she \"was aware that after 30 days [the Committee] could review the inmate.\" It is unclear why Cho was unaware of the ACLU Memo, or whether the procedures stated within it had been officially modified or abandoned. But, whether or not the ACLU Memo was a guideline or a binding directive, Cho's treatment of Gordon was the result of generalized assumptions of dangerousness and flight risk not supported by the facts.\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   Cho and the Committee's review of Gordon's custody status was subjective: they were permitted to consider any factor deemed relevant, with apparently unlimited discretion in weighing those factors.\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   To justify Gordon's continued placement in maximum security custody, Cho and the Committee based their September 22, 2010 decision on factors that were not reasonably related to a legitimate government purpose. They asserted Gordon was a \"high-risk\" and \"high flight risk\" detainee based on his pending charges, prior convictions, \"discharge and failure to comply with 2 residential drug treatment programs while on probation,\" non-compliance with reporting to his probation officer when leaving Hawai'i, extradition back to Hawai'i while on probation, and the bail amount for his pending charges. These facts, however, were not relevant to achieving the Defendants' \"legitimate government purposes\" of ensuring that Gordon appeared for trial and did not disrupt institutional order and security in the meantime.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   Cho did not identify what kind of \"high risk\" Gordon presented. There is nothing in the record that identifies the kind of conduct she feared Gordon would engage in while detained. Although Gordon did leave Hawai'i while on probation, resulting in his extradition, there was no explanation as to how absconding while on probation relates to escape from a secure jail facility, such that Gordon would automatically be a \"high flight risk.\" Furthermore, despite six prior incarcerations, there was no evidence that Gordon had committed any institutional misconduct, leaving little in the record to support Cho's belief that Gordon was a \"high risk\" inmate. Indeed, there is no evidence in the record that Cho and the Committee knew the factual bases for Gordon's prior convictions or pending charges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   Defendants never explained how Cho and the Committee's cited facts were predictors for disciplinary or management problems in custody. It is obvious that solitary confinement would effectively detain Gordon and guarantee his appearance at trial, but, under the circumstances, solitary confinement was not reasonably related to any legitimate, nonpunitive purpose. In the absence of a link between Gordon's treatment and the resolution of any real management or security problem, Gordon's conditions of confinement only achieved retribution and deterrence-\"the traditional aims of punishment\"-which \"are not legitimate nonpunitive governmental objectives.\"\n   <em>\n    Bell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1780223\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/441/520/#p535\">\n    441 U.S. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   539 n.20,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1780223\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/441/520/#p535\">\n    99 S.Ct. 1861\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citing\n   <em>\n    Kennedy v.

At the time of trial in this case, Gordon was already being held in medium custody, thus injunctive relief would\n   have been unnecessary.

Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   We conclude that Gordon was subjected to unlawful pretrial punishment when he was detained in solitary confinement for over nine months. His treatment was a violation of his rights under the due process clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution and Article I, Section 5 of the Hawai'i State Constitution. We therefore overrule the ICA's memorandum opinion to that extent. However, we conclude that Cho was entitled to qualified immunity under federal and state qualified immunity principles for her part in Gordon's confinement. Accordingly, the ICA's July 6, 2017 judgment on appeal, filed pursuant to its May 30, 2017 memorandum opinion, is affirmed on other grounds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   Petitioner/Plaintiff-Appellant Mukadin Gordon (Mr. Gordon) was arrested for fourteen felony offenses, and, prior to his trial, immediately placed in solitary confinement for nine months. There was ample evidence at the time of his pretrial incarceration that he would be a cooperative inmate because he had previously been incarcerated for other offenses without incident. Nonetheless he was placed in the strictest form of detention, normally reserved for dangerous inmates or those with a history of disciplinary problems. After thirty days of solitary confinement, his behavior was reviewed and, again, he proved to be a model inmate. During the first thirty days of his solitary confinement he had no opportunities to engage in rehabilitative programs. Yet he complied with all requirements while he was housed alone in a cell in an environment emblematic of loneliness, depression, and suffering. He was compliant and obedient to the rules. Nonetheless, his unblemished history of complying with prior incarcerations and thirty days of solitary confinement did not, in the opinion of prison officials, entitle him to a lesser degree of confinement. Instead he was put back in solitary confinement for eight more months. The group of prison officials who consigned Mr. Gordon to solitary confinement did not do so based on the nature of his charges. They did not know the factual basis for his charges, nor did they endeavor to explain how his charges could indicate a threat to institutional order and security. The purported reasons given for his relegation to solitary confinement were his failure to complete court ordered drug treatment programs, his unpermitted relocation outside the court jurisdiction while he was on probation, and, inexplicably, the amount of bail set for the crimes for which he was arrested. No justification cited by the correctional officials was reasonably related to the security and order of the Oahu Community Correctional Center where he was incarcerated. His jailors identified no \"legitimate goal\" served by his placement in solitary confinement. Thus, their action was an \"arbitrary and purposeless\" imposition of punishment, in violation of Mr. Gordon's due process right under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution to be free from punishment until convicted of a crime.\n   <em>\n    Bell v.

It is self-evident that the decision made to place Mr. Gordon in solitary confinement constituted a wholly arbitrary one, devoid of any reasonable explanation and, thus, would not qualify as a decision reasonably made by a correctional official empowered to place men and women in solitary confinement. The reasons given for his punishment were not related to institutional security. Instead, he was punished for being arrested, having high bail set for his charges, and not complying with probation in previous cases.

The case law (prior to Mr. Gordon's arrest on August 22, 2010) affirms the standard clearly established in\n   <em>\n    Bell\n   </em>\n   . As an example, the policy of placing pretrial detainees in administrative detention without evidence to support prison officials' security concerns was deemed to be without a legitimate government purpose over twenty years ago. In\n   <em>\n    United States v. Gotti\n   </em>\n   , the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-163\">\n   The essence of the issue before me is whether it is enough to justify placing a pretrial detainee in administrative detention for a stated reason without providing any basis for the reason. The cases are legion which caution that courts must give due deference to the expertise of corrections officials in operating their institutions in a manageable fashion. But surely due deference does not mean blind deference. If it were otherwise, then any statement of reason offered by a correction official, whether well-founded or not, would justify the imposition of any condition or restriction of confinement and leave the detainee completely vulnerable to arbitrary governmental action. \"Prison authorities are not afforded unbridled discretion\" because the detainee is either notorious or newsworthy or both.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   <em>\n    United States v.
