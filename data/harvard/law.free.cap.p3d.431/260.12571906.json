Robins, Jr., for aiding and abetting two first-degree murders and an attempted first-degree murder. While he was incarcerated prior to trial, Robins's cell was searched and handwritten notes he had prepared in anticipation of a meeting with counsel were seized and delivered to the prosecuting attorney. The district court granted Robins partial relief from a violation of his attorney-client privilege but placed the burden on him to object at trial if the State offered evidence or argument arising from the privileged materials. Robins argues that the district court erred in fashioning this remedy and we agree. In light of the circumstances, we vacate his judgment of conviction and remand the case with instructions to hold an evidentiary hearing to determine whether the State can overcome the presumption of prejudice arising from its violation of Robins's attorney-client privilege. If the State can overcome the presumption, a new trial should be conducted from which the Ada County Prosecutor's Office should be recused.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Robins was charged with aiding and abetting the first-degree murders of Elliot Bailey and Travone Calloway, and aiding and abetting the attempted first-degree murder of Jeanette Juraska. He was accused of aiding and abetting John Douglas for each count. The district court granted the State's motion to consolidate Robins's case with the criminal case against Douglas due to the cases' common facts, evidence, and witnesses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Following his arrest in Northern California, Robins was transferred to the Ada County Jail. On May 11, 2015, Scott McKay, Robins's local counsel, delivered discovery files to the jail so that Robins could have access to the materials while he was detained. Jail personnel informed McKay that the files could not be stored in Robins's cell because\n   of the large number of documents, but that they could be securely stored in the jail library and made available for Robins's review. When the files were delivered, McKay informed Robins that his lead counsel, Brian McMonagle, would be traveling to Boise soon to meet with Robins, and that he should prepare for the meeting by taking notes and identifying matters of discussion related to his review of the files. On May 12, 2015, Robins received permission from the jail to review the files and took notes in anticipation of his meeting with McMonagle. On May 14, 2015, upon direction from Ada County Deputy Prosecutor Shelley Akamatsu, Robins's cell was searched by jail personnel, during which these notes were seized.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The search of Robins's cell arose from information received by the Ada County Prosecutor's Office that an inmate unaffiliated with this case possessed a letter from Douglas to Robins that outlined an attempt to coordinate stories and minimize Robins's culpability for the murders. The Prosecutor's Office was informed by the inmate's counsel that his client intended to use the letter to broker a deal in his own pending case. Shortly thereafter, Akamatsu spoke with Ada County Sheriff's Office Sergeant Justin Ivie and directed him to locate a letter fitting this description. In turn, Sergeant Ivie instructed Ada County Sheriff's Office Deputies Cory Brooks and Timothy Roller to conduct a search of the unaffiliated inmate's cell to find the letter. That search did not produce the letter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   After sharing the news with Akamatsu, Sergeant Ivie received approval from the prosecuting attorney to search Robins's and Douglas's cells. Akamatsu raised the issue of attorney-client privilege with respect to the search of the unaffiliated inmate's cell but did not address the same concern with respect to the latter two searches. Thereafter, upon an order from Sergeant Ivie, Deputies Brooks and Roller conducted a search of Robins's cell. The deputies were once more instructed to locate the letter from Douglas to Robins that the unaffiliated inmate had claimed to possess.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   During the search of Robins's cell, Deputy Roller found four pieces of lined paper consisting of six pages of handwritten notes in Robins's property bin. These notes were later shown to be those that Robins made on May 12th during his review of the discovery files. In examining the notes for the purpose of their search, the deputies recognized that their contents referred to Robins's and Douglas's cases and trial. The deputies testified that the notes were not in the form of a typical legal document-i.e., they were not typewritten, on letterhead, in a legal document, marked as \"legal,\" stamped by an attorney, or in an envelope. They were, however, found in Robins's property bin, which was where inmates were expected to keep their privileged materials. The deputies also recognized that the notes were not in the form of a letter, as they did not include names or salutations. Nonetheless, under the belief that they were the objective of their search and not privileged legal documents, the deputies delivered the notes to Sergeant Ivie. The notes were then booked into evidence by Sergeant Ivie. At that time, he also notified Akamatsu, who in turn stated that the seized materials sounded promising and that she had an interest in seeing their contents. In response, Sergeant Ivie scanned the notes and emailed a copy to Akamatsu. Later that day, Akamatsu emailed a copy of the scanned notes to McMonagle and informed him that they had been found during a search of Robins's cell and booked into evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   After the search of Robins's cell, the deputies searched Douglas's cell, which resulted in the seizure of notes and a lined notebook that were also delivered to Sergeant Ivie and eventually Akamatsu. The next day, the unaffiliated inmate's attorney visited the Prosecutor's Office and turned over a letter that had been given to him by his client. This letter was revealed to be the true objective of the searches the day before.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Following these events, Robins filed a motion for order to show cause and for other relief from the State's violation of his attorney-client privilege. In the motion, Robins asserted that the notes contained privileged content and requested the dismissal of the pending charges or, in the alternative, an order recusing the Ada County Prosecutor's Office. In addition, Robins requested the return\n   of the privileged materials without the State's retention of copies, the prohibition of the State from making any evidentiary use of its review of the materials, the requirement of the State to demonstrate in advance of trial that any evidence it intended to offer originated independently of the privileged materials, and the prohibition of the State from seizing and reviewing other privileged materials.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Before the district court considered this motion, Robins also moved for relief from prejudicial joinder and sought to have his trial severed from Douglas's trial. The basis for this second motion was that severance was necessary to protect his Sixth Amendment rights because the letter written by Douglas (and turned over to the prosecuting attorney by the unaffiliated inmate) was inadmissible against him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On September 23, 2015, about four months after the notes were seized, the district court held an evidentiary hearing, at which Sergeant Ivie and Deputies Brooks and Roller were presented for testimony. During this hearing, the seized notes were admitted as a sealed exhibit. On September 30, 2015, after the district court reviewed the notes, it ordered the State to turn over all of its copies and any materials derived therefrom until it could issue a final decision on the pending motions. The State complied. On October 23, 2015, the district court issued a memorandum decision granting Robins's motion for order to show cause and for other relief in part. The district court also denied Robins's motion to sever.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   A jury ultimately found Robins guilty of all three counts against him. The letter intercepted by the unaffiliated inmate was admitted at trial over Robins's objections. Robins was sentenced to two concurrent life sentences, with forty years fixed, for the convictions of aiding and abetting first-degree murder and a concurrent fifteen-year fixed sentence for the conviction of aiding and abetting attempted first-degree murder. He timely appealed from the judgment of conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    II. ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Robins challenges the district court's decisions on two pretrial motions for relief. We will consider each of these decisions in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Motion for Relief from the State's Violation of Attorney-Client Privilege\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Robins contends that the district court erroneously required him to meet an initial burden at trial to show that he was prejudiced by the State's presentation of evidence or argument gained from its intrusion into his constitutional right to counsel. In response, the State argues that Robins is not entitled to any relief because he has failed to identify the actual prejudice he suffered as a result of the State's acquisition of his notes. \"When an appellant asserts the violation of a constitutional right, we give deference to the trial court's factual findings unless those findings are clearly erroneous.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

Rather, the right is only violated when the intrusion substantially prejudices the defendant. Prejudice can manifest itself in several ways. It results when evidence gained through the interference is used against the defendant at trial. It also can result from the prosecution's use of confidential information pertaining to the defense plans and strategy, from government influence which destroys the defendant's confidence in his attorney, and from other actions designed to give the prosecution an unfair advantage at trial.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1411420\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/612/1182/\">\n    612 F.2d at 1186-87\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (footnotes omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   In its consideration of Robins's motion, the district court found that the notes contained information about a potential alibi, potential discovery responses, and questions for counsel. The district court next examined the circumstances surrounding the notes-namely, their creation by Robins at the direction of his counsel and his effort to maintain their confidentiality by placing them in his personal property bin, albeit without clear indication that they were privileged-and concluded that they constituted confidential communications that were intended to facilitate defense counsel's legal representation. Particularly, the district court described, \"[t]he notes at issue deal with Robins' thoughts and commentary regarding some very specific facts of the case. It is fair to say that the State has been forewarned as to potential defense strategies.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Given the nature of the notes, the district court found that Robins may have been prejudiced because the State had an \"inside look\" as to how he viewed the case and his defense. Because the notes were confidential and, if admitted, prejudicial, the district court held that the notes would be inadmissible at trial under Idaho Rule of Evidence 502 or, if necessary, Rule of Evidence 403. In turn, the\n   district court reaffirmed its earlier order requiring the State to return all copies of the notes and any prepared materials deriving from the notes. From there, the district court recognized that the return of the notes did not erase the memory of their contents, but that it was impossible to determine whether there would ever be any actual prejudice to the defendant. Thus, the district court distinguished\n   <em>\n    potential\n   </em>\n   prejudice from\n   <em>\n    actual\n   </em>\n   prejudice, finding that the State's access to Robins's defense strategies constituted potential prejudice but that actual prejudice would only be realized at trial. Referencing the State's assertions that the notes did not contain anything it did not already know and that it was prepared to identify an independent source for each piece of information included within the notes, the district court denied Robins's separate requests for dismissal and recusal. The district court granted the motion to the extent that it held the notes were inadmissible and that the State could not utilize or refer to the notes in any way during trial absent Robins's opening of the door. The district court concluded by explaining that if Robins believed at trial that the State was offering evidence or argument that could only have been obtained from the notes, he could object and the State would then be required to demonstrate an independent source. At trial, no objections of this kind were made.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   On appeal, the parties do not dispute the contents of the notes, nor do they dispute the district court's conclusion that the notes were privileged.

Here, the district court found that the contents of Robins's notes were privileged and that the State obtained access to those notes. Under one interpretation of the\n   <em>\n    Stuart\n   </em>\n   decisions, this constituted a prima facie showing of prejudice, at which point the State should have been required to establish that Robins's constitutional right to counsel had not been violated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   This calculus was not employed by the district court despite it being part of the relief requested by Robins. On the other hand, the argument against a straightforward application of this analysis to the case at hand is that the\n   <em>\n    Stuart\n   </em>\n   decisions acknowledge that the defendant had identified specific evidence-i.e., names and locations of witnesses that were called to testify by the State-that could have been drawn solely from his privileged conversations with counsel. This counterargument matches the State's general contention that Robins has not established that he was prejudiced because he has not offered any specificity regarding the evidence that the State acquired with its access to his notes. Finding that\n   <em>\n    Stuart\n   </em>\n   stands for the rule that a shifting of the burden must be implemented where the defendant has made a prima facie showing of prejudice, the issue turns to how such a showing can be made.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   To this point, Robins relies on a case-\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The trial judge makes specific factual findings of the independent nature of the Government's evidence or trial strategies and thereafter provides an appropriate remedy if the Government fails to prove by a preponderance of the evidence an independent source-suppression may be granted pre-trial, and harmless error may be applied post-trial.

For example, in\n   <em>\n    Cooper\n   </em>\n   , the court concluded that the prima facie standard was not met in a case involving the seizure of privileged materials from the defendant's jail cell:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   Petitioner, here, has not pointed to any evidence that law enforcement \"deliberately\" or \"affirmatively\" intruded into the attorney-client relationship for the purpose of obtaining the defense trial strategy. Detective Daniel served a valid search warrant on petitioner for the sole purpose of an investigation of threats to potential witnesses, not to interfere with petitioner's relationship with his defense counsel. Daniel was not looking for evidence or trial strategy regarding the pending murder charge on the behalf of the prosecution. In addition, the prosecutor filed a declaration stating that he had not seen the material seized from petitioner's cell, and that Daniel, the detective who conducted the search, assured the prosecutor that the search was conducted \"in a fashion which respected attorney-client privilege.\" Therefore, under the governing federal law set forth in\n   <em>\n    Danielson\n   </em>\n   , the state courts properly found that the petitioner had the burden to show prejudice, and that such burden did not shift to the prosecution.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <em>\n    Cooper\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2008%20WL%20608336\">\n    2008 WL 608336\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *13. The\n   <em>\n    Navarro\n   </em>\n   court reached a similar conclusion after considering evidence showing that a jail cell search arising from a prosecutor's request to locate any information on gang activity or witness threats led to the seizure of privileged materials.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2687593\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/419/1196/#p1201\">\n    419 F.Supp.2d at 1202-03\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court emphasized that the materials were properly seized and were not shown to the prosecutor but instead delivered directly to the trial judge.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2687593\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/419/1196/#p1201\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The facts here closely follow the facts in\n   <em>\n    Cooper\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Navarro\n   </em>\n   through the search and the initial seizure of privileged materials. Specifically, in this case, jail personnel were instructed to locate a letter that had come\n   into the possession of another inmate that was alleged to have been written by Douglas to Robins. Testimony from the evidentiary hearing indicates that the deputies were aware of possible exposure to material protected by inmates' attorney-client privilege. Robins does not contest the legality of the search on appeal. In short, it seems clear that the search was not conducted for a purpose of intruding on Robins's privilege.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Yet, once the privileged notes were seized from Robins's cell, the facts in this case depart from those in\n   <em>\n    Cooper\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Navarro\n   </em>\n   -namely, the record shows that the notes were delivered to Deputy Prosecutor Akamatsu who, according to the district court, was the first person to identify that they were private and intended for an attorney. At that point, the prosecuting attorney provided a copy of the notes to Robins's counsel and informed him that they had been seized. From there, however, the record does not indicate that Akamatsu took any action to insulate herself from the privileged materials. Rather, the record shows that Akamatsu and the Ada County Prosecutor's Office retained the notes for four months until the district court ordered that all copies be returned to Robins. The record once more fails to establish that Akamatsu was in some way screened from further exposure to the notes throughout this time. In fact, given that Akamatsu argued throughout the proceedings on Robins's motion that the notes were not privileged because they were not held out to be confidential communications with counsel it can be presumed that she was not walled off from their contents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Prosecutorial access to and retention of privileged content was at the center of the government's intrusion in\n   <em>\n    Danielson\n   </em>\n   .

Such reasoning resonates strongly. The record here shows that the prosecuting attorney had prolonged access to privileged notes that included at least some of Robins's possible trial and defense strategies. While there are not clear answers as to if and how the prosecution's access and retention led to specific outcomes that were prejudicial to Robins at trial, this uncertainty is precisely the problem when the privileged communications at issue consist of the defendant's plans and strategies. Given the protections underlying the attorney-client privilege and the constitutional right to counsel, we hold that the circumstances here were sufficient to conclude that Robins satisfied a prima facie showing of prejudice. That being the case, the burden should have shifted to the State to show that Robins's rights had not been violated. The State asserted in response to Robins's motion that it had the ability to satisfy this burden by showing an independent origin for its evidence and argument. The district court even recognized the State's claim in its ruling. Yet, this ability was never tested as the burden was never shifted. This constitutes error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Because this appeal arises from Robins's judgment of conviction, our finding that the district court did not properly address Robins's prima facie showing of the violation of his constitutional right requires us to vacate that judgment and the corresponding sentence. There remains a difficult question as to how to proceed now that a trial has occurred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Robins argues that this Court should dismiss the charges against him because prejudice resulting from an invasion of his attorney-client privilege cannot be removed, isolated, or avoided in a new trial. As an alternative, Robins seeks a new trial with the recusal of the Ada County Prosecutor's Office and the requirement on the new prosecuting attorney to present proof that every piece of evidence and strategic decision has an independent origin. The State responds that dismissal is unwarranted because it is not tailored to the specific harm at issue and that retrial is the appropriate remedy in cases involving government intrusion into the attorney-client relationship.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   The U.S. Supreme Court has explained that \"[c]ases involving Sixth Amendment deprivations are subject to the general rule that remedies should be tailored to the injury suffered from the constitutional violation and should not unnecessarily infringe on competing interests.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The facts of\n   <em>\n    Morrison\n   </em>\n   are distinct from those at hand but the general rule described by the Supreme Court offers useful guidance in our effort to ascertain the appropriate remedy for this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   For support of his request for dismissal, Robins asks us to consider a similar outcome in\n   <em>\n    State v.

The facts of that case certainly echo many of those that are at issue here. In\n   <em>\n    Cory\n   </em>\n   , the Washington Supreme Court dismissed a case after conducting a post-trial review of the denial of a pretrial motion to dismiss based on a violation of the defendant's right to counsel.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=382%20P.2d%201019\">\n    382 P.2d at 1019\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

And if the investigating officers and the prosecution know that the most severe consequence which can follow from their violation of one of the most valuable rights of a defendant, is that they will have to try the case twice, it can hardly be supposed that they will be seriously deterred from indulging in this very simple and convenient method of obtaining evidence and knowledge of the defendant's trial strategy.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=382%20P.2d%201019\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=382%20P.2d%201019\">\n    at 1022-23\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (footnote omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Robins correctly notes that Idaho courts have cited\n   <em>\n    Cory\n   </em>\n   ; however, such citations are relatively insignificant as they pertain to resolution of this case.\n   <em>\n    State v.

This remedy is consistent with other courts that have dealt with situations of this kind.

Because Robins appealed directly from his judgment of conviction, returning this action to the district court is procedurally distinct. Even so, we believe such a remedy is appropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   This case suffered from an improper pretrial remedy. It bears emphasizing that the impropriety of that remedy cut both ways. By not shifting the burden to the State, the district court failed to recognize the violation of Robins's constitutional right to counsel as defined by the presumption of prejudice we have found he established. Yet, by not shifting the burden, the remedy also denied the State its chance to prove that such a violation did not in fact occur. Given that the State has consistently asserted that it had an ability to establish an independent origin for all of its evidence and argument, the double-edged nature of the improper remedy is significant. We recognized above that Robins made a prima facie showing of prejudice. We now also recognize that such a showing remained rebuttable and the State should have been afforded this opportunity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   The difficulty inherent in remanding this case for an evidentiary hearing to determine whether the State can rebut the presumption is not treated lightly. Nonetheless, we find this necessary, as the record before the Court leaves us unable to determine whether the State could meet this burden. The district court found that Robins's notes contained privileged defense strategy. On appeal,\n   Robins lays out how the information contained in those notes translated to the parties' arguments at trial, thus intending to imply that the State's access to the notes necessarily resulted in its prejudicial use of the same. This advocacy notwithstanding, the State has not yet been challenged to address this specific issue, and therefore we are unable to assess whether Robins's theory holds up when the State bears its burden of proof. The district court is the appropriate forum for that inquiry to be made. While not simple or ideal to return to a pretrial issue now that trial has occurred, this remedy provides both parties an opportunity to consider a narrow question under the circumstances that should have been in place when Robins's motion was first presented.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   In remanding the case, we find it prudent to instruct the district court as to the scope of the evidentiary hearing that is to take place. The Ada County Prosecutor's Office is to handle the hearing for the State. Procedurally, at the hearing, the State must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the evidence it presented at trial and its trial strategy derived from an origin independent of Robins's notes.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Danielson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9350022\" index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/325/1054/\">\n    325 F.3d at 1074\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Strategy in this context is a broad term that includes, but is not limited to, such things as decisions about the scope and nature of the investigation, about what witnesses to call (and in what order), about what questions to ask (and in what order), about what lines of defense to anticipate in presenting the case in chief, and about what to save for possible rebuttal.\"). Unlike in\n   <em>\n    Stuart\n   </em>\n   , where this Court remanded the action for a similar inquiry and the State was eventually able to show that the defendant had not been prejudiced through use of other exceptions to the exclusionary rule,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"428322\" index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/idaho/136/490/#p492\">\n    136 Idaho 490\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 495,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"428322\" index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/idaho/136/490/#p492\">\n    36 P.3d 1278\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1283 (2001), the State has consistently argued here that it was able to satisfy the standard for the independent-origin exception. As such, it will be strictly held to that position. However, if the State fails to meet this heavy burden, the trial judge must determine whether the evidence or trial strategy that was tainted by the illegal evidence affected the substantial rights of the defendant or was merely harmless error.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   I.C.R. 52.

Given the pervasive depths prejudicial access to defense strategies can reach, merely retrying the case with the recusal of Ada County Prosecutor's Office may not be enough. Greater steps such as the employment of additional, independent counsel assigned solely to ensure that no further prejudice emerges during any subsequent prosecution may prove necessary. Additionally, dismissing the charges should remain an option if the circumstances are such that prejudice arising from the State's prior transgression cannot be completely purged or escaped.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

The district court agreed that the letter was hearsay, but found that it was admissible against Robins through the hearsay exception for statements against interest under Idaho Rule of Evidence 804(b)(3). In reaching this conclusion, the district court relied on the analysis of\n   <em>\n    State v.

Because the letter could still play a role in further proceedings of this case, however, we will consider the arguments Robins raises against the district court's decision to admit the letter as evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   This Court reviews a trial court's admission of evidence under the abuse of discretion standard.\n   <em>\n    State v.

In so doing, the Court first explained that the hearsay exception was based on \"the commonsense notion that reasonable people, even reasonable people who are not especially honest, tend not to make self-inculpatory statements unless they believe them to be true.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"39579\" index=\"137\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/512/594/#p596\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"39579\" index=\"137\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/512/594/#p596\">\n    at 599\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"39579\" index=\"138\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/512/594/#p596\">\n    114 S.Ct. 2431\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Yet, inherent in this notion is a narrow definition of \"statement\" such that the exception \"does not allow admission of non-self-inculpatory statements, even if they are made within a broader narrative that is generally self-inculpatory.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"39579\" index=\"139\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/512/594/#p596\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"39579\" index=\"139\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/512/594/#p596\">\n    at 600-01\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"39579\" index=\"140\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/512/594/#p596\">\n    114 S.Ct. 2431\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This is so because \"[t]he fact that a person is making a broadly self-inculpatory confession does not make more credible the confession's non-self-inculpatory parts.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"39579\" index=\"141\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/512/594/#p596\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"39579\" index=\"141\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/512/594/#p596\">\n    at 599\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"39579\" index=\"142\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/512/594/#p596\">\n    114 S.Ct. 2431\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court explained further that statements may not be presumed to be self-inculpatory for purposes of the exception solely because they are part of a narrative that constitutes a full confession, and added that this is especially true when the statements implicate another person.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"39579\" index=\"143\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/512/594/#p596\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"39579\" index=\"143\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/512/594/#p596\">\n    at 600-01\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"39579\" index=\"144\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/512/594/#p596\">\n    114 S.Ct. 2431\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Consistent with this guidance, application of Idaho Rule of Evidence 804(b)(3) requires the court to consider each statement included in a broader narrative to determine whether it is in fact genuinely self-inculpatory against the declarant. The Court of Appeals recognized this mandate in\n   <em>\n    Averett\n   </em>\n   , where it iterated much of the foregoing analysis and noted that since\n   <em>\n    Williamson\n   </em>\n   federal courts have admitted third-party statements that inculpate a defendant only when three conditions are satisfied: (1) the statement must be genuinely self-inculpatory to the declarant, (2) the statement is made to a private person and does not seek to curry the favor of law enforcement authorities, and (3) the statement does not shift blame.\n   <em>\n    Averett\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3677752\" index=\"145\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/idaho/142/879/\">\n    142 Idaho at 890\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3677752\" index=\"146\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/idaho/142/879/\">\n    136 P.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   361 (citing John W. Strong,\n   <em>\n    McCormick on Evidence\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 319 (5th ed. vol. 2 1999) ). Error arose in both\n   <em>\n    Williamson\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Averett\n   </em>\n   because a narrative was admitted in full despite the inclusion of statements within the narrative that solely inculpated the defendant; thus, the first condition was not satisfied because those particular statements were not self-inculpatory to the declarant. Similarly, in this case, the second and third conditions are not disputed, and the issue instead centers on whether particular statements within the letter were self-inculpatory against Douglas as the declarant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   In its ruling, the district court explained that the letter would be hearsay if it was offered to show that Douglas was responsible for committing the underlying murders and Robins was involved in their plotting. Applying Rule 804(b)(3), the district court found that the entire letter was admissible against Robins because it comported with the three conditions set forth in\n   <em>\n    Averett\n   </em>\n   :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-82\">\n   Here, the letter is genuinely self-inculpatory as to Mr. Douglas as he places the blame on himself for committing the murders. In fact, no part of the letter seeks to shift the blame to Mr. Robins, but rather seeks to give Mr. Robins an alibi, so that both Defendants do not have to \"go down\" for the crime. In addition, the letter was meant to be delivered to Mr. Robins, not to law enforcement. Indeed, the context would clearly indicate that Mr. Douglas would not want law enforcement to see it. The letter contains statements that were not intended to be given to law enforcement as a self-serving confession, but rather to another inmate in an attempt to create a story which Mr. Douglas believed would help both Defendants in their cases.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Robins argues on appeal that the district court erred by not individually reviewing the statements within the greater narrative to determine whether each one was against Douglas's interest. His argument is correct. When parsed individually, the only statement in the letter that met the standard described in\n   <em>\n    Williamson\n   </em>\n   was the admission that \"I bodyed them 2 dudes.\" The remainder of the statements cannot be considered genuinely self-inculpatory to Douglas and therefore they should not have been admitted through Rule 804(b)(3). In\n   <em>\n    Williamson\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court explicitly rejected the idea that a full narrative could be admitted by including its\n   non-self-inculpatory parts and excluding its clearly self-serving parts.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"39579\" index=\"147\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/512/594/#p596\">\n    512 U.S. at 601\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"39579\" index=\"148\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/512/594/#p596\">\n    114 S.Ct. 2431\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This conclusion applies here and the letter should not have been admitted in full against Robins. Finding otherwise disregards the specific nature of the statements in the letter, and in turn undercuts the careful standard that must be employed when applying the hearsay exception.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   <strong>\n    III. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   In consideration of the foregoing, we vacate the judgment of conviction and remand the case with instructions to hold an evidentiary hearing consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Chief Justice BURDICK, Justices HORTON, BEVAN, and Justice Pro Tem MEYER concur.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
