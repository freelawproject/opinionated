While investigating an aggravated assault in March 2015, an operations commander with the Cochise County Sheriff's Office received a tip that the assailant had been seen at Lohse's home and that Lohse could identify him. When the commander arrived at Lohse's home, he opened and walked through first the unlocked gate of a four-foot-high chainlink fence and then the gate of a six-foot-tall opaque, wooden, privacy fence. Although a witness testified that one of the fences also displayed a \"private property sign,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   the commander testified only that there \"could have been\" such a sign, but he could not recall. In any event, the trial court did not make a factual determination concerning whether such a sign had been posted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   After passing through both gates, the commander went straight to the front door where he knocked and identified himself.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 3 When Lohse opened the door, the commander immediately smelled the odor of raw marijuana coming from inside the home. Lohse admitted there was a small amount of marijuana in the house, and another officer confirmed that no one present possessed a \"medical marijuana card.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   A.R.S. \u00a7 36-2801(13), (14). The commander then called narcotics detectives, who obtained a search warrant and discovered morphine, methamphetamine, marijuana, a handgun, a shotgun, and several items of drug paraphernalia.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 4 Before trial, Lohse filed motions to suppress all evidence uncovered by the search of his home, arguing \"sheriff's personnel trespassed into the curtilage of [his] home\" and that the search warrant was invalid because it listed an address different than his own. Following a hearing, the trial court denied both motions, finding the officers had legitimately entered the curtilage pursuant to their community-caretaking function and, although the search warrant listed a neighbor's address, \"the affidavit ... accurately describe[d] the residence actually served.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 5 Following trial, the jury found Lohse guilty of possession of a narcotic drug, possession of marijuana, two counts of misconduct involving weapons, and five counts of possession of drug paraphernalia.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The trial court suspended imposition of sentence and placed Lohse on concurrent terms of probation, the longest of which were four years.

Because the open gates in these cases did not block people from entering the property, they suggested visitors were welcome to enter the property. Without such a barrier, the cases are more analogous to those involving only a sign; and the logic of these cases suggests that, had the gates been closed and signs posted, any implied license to enter would have been revoked.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Burdyshaw\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6140597\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ark-app/69/243/\">\n    10 S.W.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   921 ;\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12644920\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/se2d/783/504/\">\n    783 S.E.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   510 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

Here, the record suggests the public was presented with two barriers, the second opaque. Further, there was evidence those barriers were coupled with a warning sign discouraging entry. If true, a reasonable person would believe that Lohse had asserted an elevated privacy interest in the curtilage of his home. Thus, because law enforcement officers without a warrant are no more privileged to enter the curtilage of a home than the general public,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Jardines\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12696458\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/569/1/#p5\">\n    569 U.S. at 8-9\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12696458\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/569/1/#p5\">\n    133 S.Ct. 1409\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , entry under such circumstances would constitute an unreasonable search under the Fourth Amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b6 16 The state argues any sign could have \"reasonably been construed as informing visitors not to go anywhere on the property outside of the pathway to Lohse's front door.\" While this interpretation may be reasonable when a no-trespassing sign is unaccompanied by other circumstances, the same cannot be said when such a sign has been posted on a privacy fence surrounding the curtilage of a home. Instead, the more reasonable message would be that uninvited visitors should not enter within the marked fence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b6 17 Here, however, we cannot resolve whether Lohse effectively revoked the general license because the trial court resolved the question under the community-caretaker exception and therefore did not make the requisite findings. Although it is undisputed from the record that Lohse's home was surrounded by a chainlink fence and an opaque privacy fence, and that officers opened both gates to enter the curtilage, it remains unresolved whether a private-property or no-trespassing sign had been posted on the day in question. We also note that a witness testified to additional signals that Lohse did not want to be disturbed by uninvited visitors: his mailbox was located on the street and security cameras were visibly in place.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6905013\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/152/619/#p623\">\n    152 So.3d at 624\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

But, the absence of a no-trespassing sign was not necessary to whether the community-caretaking doctrine justified the officers' entry into the curtilage.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Horton v.

Lohse complains the search warrant lacked sufficient particularity because it listed the wrong address and merely described his \"trailer ...
