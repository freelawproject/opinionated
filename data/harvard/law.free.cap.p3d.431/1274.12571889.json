We first conclude that Hernandez's challenge to his sentence was not precluded by his plea of no contest. We also hold that Hernandez's right of allocution, which is protected by the Hawaii Revised Statutes and the Hawai'i Constitution, was violated when the district court did not afford him the opportunity to be heard prior to being sentenced. Lastly, we conclude that the district court's acceptance of Hernandez's no contest plea without an on-the-record colloquy was plain error. We thus vacate Hernandez's conviction and remand the case to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On November 6, 2014, the State of Hawai'i charged Pierre Hernandez by complaint in the District Court of the First Circuit (district court) with harassment by stalking in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) \u00a7 711-1106.5.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On January 6, 2015, Hernandez through counsel filed a \"Rule 43 Plea by Mail\" (\"plea by mail document\" or \"the document\") pursuant to Rule 43 of the Hawai'i Rules of Penal Procedure (HRPP).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The document indicated that Hernandez was pleading no contest to the charged offense of harassment by stalking. It also stated that Hernandez understood that (1) he had the right to be present at various proceedings, including arraignment, the entry of plea, and sentencing; (2) he was voluntarily waiving his right to be present at these proceedings and to be questioned in open court; and (3) he was authorizing his lawyer to represent him at the proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In addition, the plea by mail document stated that Hernandez was consenting to the court's imposition of a sentence in his absence and that he understood \"that non-compliance with the court's judgment or order will result in the issuance of a bench warrant, subjecting [him] to being arrested and having to appear in court.\" Further, the document included a declaration by counsel, stating that Hernandez represented to him that he did not wish to be present and wished for the proceedings to be conducted in his absence; that counsel read and explained the plea by mail document to Hernandez; and that the statements in the document were consistent with counsel's understanding of Hernandez's position.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   At a hearing on January 7, 2015,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   counsel for Hernandez indicated that Hernandez, who was not present, was residing in another state and had requested deferred acceptance of his no contest plea. The district court stated that it was in receipt of the plea by mail document submitted by counsel that\n   indicated Hernandez had completed twelve years of education, was aware of the charge against him, and understood his possible defenses, as well as the maximum possible penalties and any potential citizenship issues a conviction might raise. Although Hernandez was not physically present and there was no established communication with him at the hearing, the court accepted the no contest plea, ruling that the plea was made knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily. The court further concluded that Hernandez knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily waived his right to a jury trial based on a waiver of jury trial form also submitted by defense counsel. The court then found Hernandez guilty as charged and proceeded to sentencing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Before the court imposed sentence, the complainant provided a statement to the court in which she objected to the granting of a deferral and stated, inter alia, that another complainant had filed a restraining order against Hernandez and that the court should impose jail time. The court thereupon denied Hernandez's motion for deferral of acceptance of the no contest plea and restated that Hernandez had signed all the waiver documents; that his no contest plea was made knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily; and that the court had found him guilty. The district court sentenced Hernandez to a probationary term of eighteen months conditioned on Hernandez serving thirty days in jail and two hundred hours of community service and also imposed fees totaling $130. The court stated that, if Hernandez was not returning to Hawai'i, a mittimus was to issue forthwith. After counsel for Hernandez indicated that he would send the paperwork to Hernandez and inform him that the court was ordering him to appear on February 9, 2015, the court delayed the mittimus until that date.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Hernandez appealed to the Intermediate Court of Appeals (ICA) from the district court's judgment entered on January 7, 2015,\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"and all trial and pre-trial motions filed or made by Defendant, that were denied by the Court.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    II. ICA PROCEEDINGS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In his opening brief, Hernandez argued that the district court committed plain error when it violated his constitutional and statutory right of allocution, which he had not waived, by failing to give him an opportunity to make a statement prior to being sentenced. This court, Hernandez contended, has previously questioned whether the denial of presentence allocution constitutes harmless error and has stated that the remedy under such circumstances is a remand for resentencing. In addition, Hernandez asserted that the district court did not personally address him, whereas the complainant was permitted to provide a lengthy statement, which included an objection to a possible deferral, an entreaty to impose jail time, and a reference to a separate restraining order against Hernandez. Hernandez concluded that the denial of his right to allocution deprived him of his constitutional right to due process under article I, section 5 of the Hawai'i Constitution.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In its answering brief, the State argued that the ICA lacked appellate jurisdiction because Hernandez asserted nonjurisdictional claims, which were precluded by the entry of an intelligent and voluntary guilty plea.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Because Hernandez did not file a motion to withdraw his plea and his plea was not made on the condition that he may appeal certain rulings, the State submitted that the case should be dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Alternatively, the State contended that Hernandez's no contest plea complied with HRPP Rule 11, adding that the district court ensured that his plea was voluntary and not the product of threats or promises. As to Hernandez's argument regarding his right of allocution, the State maintained that HRPP Rule 43(d)(2) does not require the court to address the defendant, and in any event, Hernandez voluntarily waived his right to be present at all proceedings, including sentencing, authorized his counsel to represent him at sentencing, and waived his right to be questioned in open court. Thus, the State argued, Hernandez's no contest plea was valid under HRPP Rule 32 (2012).\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In his reply, Hernandez contended that the State's argument regarding jurisdiction lacked merit because an appellate court may review an invalid no contest plea under plain error, as in this case. Although his counsel informed the court that he would enter a no contest plea, Hernandez asserted, \"it was nonetheless incumbent on the court to address the defendant personally.\" Hernandez maintained that the court in accepting a guilty plea cannot rely solely on counsel's presence and representations, concluding that an on-the-record colloquy was, at a minimum, required to show that he had full understanding of the no contest plea and its consequences.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On March 17, 2017, the ICA entered a summary disposition order affirming the district court's judgment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   The ICA rejected Hernandez's contention that the district court plainly erred by not personally addressing him regarding his right of allocution prior to imposing sentence. The ICA concluded that Hernandez's claims were not jurisdictional, that he did not file a motion to withdraw his no contest plea, and that his plea was not conditional. The ICA thus concluded that Hernandez was \"precluded from 'later asserting any nonjurisdictional claims [to his no contest plea], including constitutional challenges to the pretrial proceedings.' \" (Quoting\n   <em>\n    State v.

DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On certiorari, Hernandez presents two questions for review: (1) whether the ICA erred in rejecting his appeal of the district court's denial of his right of allocution at sentencing on the basis that the challenge was precluded by his no contest plea and (2) whether the district court plainly erred in accepting his no contest plea when it was not made knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily. The first question consists of two subparts: (a) whether Hernandez was barred from challenging the manner in which his sentence was imposed because he pleaded no contest to the charge and (b) whether the district court's failure to personally address Hernandez prior to imposing sentence violated his right of allocution. We consider these issues below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Hernandez's Challenge to the Legality of His Sentence\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    1. The ICA Erred in Rejecting Hernandez's Claim on the Basis that It Was Nonjurisdictional.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Hernandez contends that the ICA erred in concluding that he was barred from asserting\n   that the district court deprived him of his right of allocution because it was a nonjurisdictional claim. Hernandez reasons that allocution arises during sentencing-after the plea has been accepted-and Hawai'i courts have distinguished between challenges made to events that occur before the plea and those that occur after the plea.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   We have held that \"[g]enerally, a guilty plea made voluntarily and intelligently precludes a defendant from later asserting any nonjurisdictional claims, including constitutional challenges to the pretrial proceedings.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

Thus, Hernandez was not required to file a motion to withdraw his plea in order to assert nonjurisdictional claims related to sentencing on appeal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rauch\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12263988\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/94/315/#p323\">\n    94 Hawai'i at 323\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12263988\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/94/315/#p323\">\n    13 P.3d at 332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (considering the merits of an appeal of sentence without regard to whether the defendant had filed a motion to withdraw a no contest plea);\n   <em>\n    Dudoit\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12259609\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/90/262/\">\n    90 Hawai'i at 265-75\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12259609\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/90/262/\">\n    978 P.2d at 703-13\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (same).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Further, the ICA's alternative ground for concluding that it lacked jurisdiction to consider the appeal in this case-that Hernandez's no contest plea was not conditional-is inapposite. A conditional plea is employed when the defendant seeks to challenge on appeal a ruling involving a pretrial motion, which is a circumstance that is not present in this case. HRPP Rule 11(a)(2) (2014) states in relevant part, \"With the approval of the court and the consent of the State, a defendant may enter a\n   <em>\n    conditional plea of guilty or no contest\n   </em>\n   , reserving in writing the right, on appeal from the judgment, to seek\n   <em>\n    review of the adverse determination of any specific pretrial motion\n   </em>\n   .\" (Emphases added.) Hernandez does not seek review of an \"adverse determination of any specific pretrial motion,\" but rather, the manner in which his sentence was imposed following the district court's acceptance of his no contest plea.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Consequently, the ICA erred in concluding that Hernandez's assertion of nonjurisdictional claims regarding his sentencing on appeal was barred by his no contest plea.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    2.

Under such circumstances, the penal rule allows a court to dispense with the requirement of addressing the defendant personally in open court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   HRPP Rule 43(d)(2)(B) (cross-referencing HRPP Rule 32(a) (2012) ).

I continue to believe \"this court's power to deal with plain error is one to be exercised\n   <em>\n    sparingly\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    with caution\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

In my view, the facts of this case do not justify plain error review. Moreover, Hernandez waived his right to engage personally with the court, including the right to engage in a colloquy and the right of pre-sentence allocution, when he initiated a proceeding by which he chose to plead remotely and remain absent from that point forward. Therefore, I respectfully concur in part and dissent in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   On November 6, 2014, the State charged Hernandez with one count of harassment by stalking in violation of Hawai'i Revised Statutes (HRS) \u00a7 711-1106.5. Thereafter, Hernandez relocated from Hawai'i to the mainland and represented to defense counsel that he did not intend to return to Hawai'i.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   No longer living in Hawai'i, Hernandez availed himself of HRPP Rule 43,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   which allows a criminal defendant charged with a non-felony offense to waive the defendant's right to be present at court proceedings when the defendant resides off island, and filed his HRPP Rule 43 plea with the district court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Hernandez verified that he understood the implications of the plea and that he wished to make use of the HRPP Rule 43 plea by mail procedure by signing the document and providing his fingerprint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Attached to the HRPP Rule 43 plea by mail document was defense counsel's signed declaration. In his declaration, defense counsel stated that: (1) defense counsel \"explained the defendant's right to be present\"; (2) Hernandez represented to defense counsel that he \"does not wish to be present\" and that he \"wishes the proceedings to be conducted in [his] absence\"; (3) defense counsel \"read and explained\" the HRPP Rule 43 plea to Hernandez; (4) the statements in defense counsel's declaration \"conform with [his] understanding of [Hernandez's] position\"; (5) defense counsel believed that Hernandez understood the HRPP Rule 43 plea in its entirety; (6) Hernandez's \"plea is voluntary\"; and (7) Hernandez \"understands the nature of the charge and the possible consequences.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   The district court ruled that Hernandez's plea was \"knowing, voluntary, and intelligent\" in light of Hernandez's representations in the HRPP Rule 43 plea by mail document. Consequently, the district court accepted Hernandez's no contest plea and found him guilty as charged.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   The district court sentenced Hernandez to one and one-half years of probation, with the condition that he spend thirty days in jail, serve 200 hours of community service, pay a $55 criminal injuries fee, receive a mental health assessment and obtain treatment if\n   required, and have no further contact with the complaining witness. As Hernandez was not present, he did not address the court before being sentenced. Hernandez appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   In the ICA, Hernandez argued,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , that the district court plainly erred in accepting his no contest plea. He asserted that the district court failed to comply with HRPP Rule 11(d)\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   because it did not read the deportation advisement contained in HRS \u00a7 802E-2 on the record to Hernandez prior to accepting his plea. Hernandez also argued that the district court deprived him of his right of allocution by failing to afford him an opportunity to personally address the court before sentencing. The State countered that the district court did not err in accepting Hernandez's plea because \"Hernandez's no contest plea complied with HRPP Rules 11 and 32 as required by HRPP Rule 43(d)(2).\" The ICA affirmed the district court's judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   On certiorari, Hernandez now contends the trial court erred in accepting his no contest plea because, among other things, the court's failure to conduct an on-the-record colloquy with Hernandez forecloses the possibility that Hernandez's plea was made knowingly, voluntarily, and intelligently. Hernandez also argues that he was denied his constitutional right of allocution, which he did not waive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   <strong>\n    II. DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   The Majority holds that the district court's acceptance of Hernandez's plea without an on-the-record colloquy was plain error, and that Hernandez's right of allocution was violated. Majority at 2. I respectfully disagree. Because Hernandez did not contest the district court's acceptance of his plea at the district court stage, and in fact affirmatively availed himself of the convenience afforded to him by HRPP Rule 43,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   I would not exercise plain error review to vacate the district court's acceptance of the plea now. I would further hold that by knowingly availing himself of the HRPP Rule 43 plea by mail procedure, Hernandez waived his right both to engage in a colloquy before the court accepted his plea, and to allocute before sentencing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   <strong>\n    A. This court should not exercise plain error review to analyze the district court's acceptance of Hernandez's no contest plea.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   The Majority holds plain error review is appropriate whenever substantial rights are affected. Majority at 24. Accordingly, it notices plain error by the district court in accepting Hernandez's plea without conducting a colloquy, an omission which it holds affected Hernandez's substantial rights. Majority at 34-36. I respectfully disagree. Because it is clear to me that Hernandez's plea was voluntary, and that he benefitted from the use of the HRPP Rule 43 plea by mail procedure, I believe that the district court's acceptance of his plea without conducting a colloquy did not affect Hernandez's substantial rights. As such, the facts of this case do not justify our sparing use of plain error review. Moreover, I believe Hernandez's decision to avail himself of the HRPP Rule 43 plea by mail procedure was \"invited error\" that should not be reversed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   My views on the expansiveness of plain error review continue to diverge from those of the Majority. Plain error review should be exercised sparingly, and the facts of this case do not warrant plain error review. It is well established that issues raised for the first time on appeal are waived absent plain error.\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12313068\" index=\"171\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/122/92/#p100\">\n    122 Hawai'i at 133-34\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12313068\" index=\"172\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/122/92/#p100\">\n    223 P.3d at 198-99\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Nakayama, J., dissenting) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Kawamata Farms, Inc. v.

As noted previously, this court's discretion to correct plain error represents a departure from the rule that parties bear the costs of their counsel's mistakes.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ui\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"185\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=142%20Haw.%20287\">\n    142 Hawai'i at 302\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12567534\" index=\"186\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/418/628/#p634\">\n    418 P.3d at 643\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Nakayama, J., dissenting) (quotation and citation omitted). This \"mistake,\" to the extent that defense counsel's compliance with Hernandez's wish to take advantage of an established pleading procedure can be considered a mistake, was not so prejudicial to Hernandez that we should exercise our discretion to correct it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   The Majority holds the district court's failure to conduct an in-person colloquy with Hernandez led to an involuntary no contest plea and therefore affected Hernandez's substantial rights. Majority at 34-36. However, because Hernandez chose to avail himself of the benefits of the HRPP Rule 43 plea by mail procedure,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   I cannot agree that Hernandez's substantial rights were affected. Hernandez filed the HRPP Rule 43 plea by mail document asserting his voluntary waiver of his right to be present at various proceedings including arraignment, the entry of plea, and sentencing, and the right to be questioned in open court. He verified his desire to avail himself of the HRPP Rule 43 plea by mail procedure by signing the document and providing his fingerprint. Hernandez also represented to counsel that he did not wish to return to Hawai'i to be present at the aforementioned proceedings, and affirmed that counsel read and explained the plea by mail document to him. Accordingly, Hernandez did not object to the court's acceptance of his plea at trial. Although the court did not conduct an in-person colloquy with Hernan\n   dez, his substantial rights were not affected because he achieved his desired outcome when the court accepted his plea. Thus, we should not apply plain error review to correct the \"error.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Moreover, I believe we should not exercise our discretion to notice and correct the district court's \"error\" because Hernandez never asserted on appeal or on certiorari that his substantial rights were affected to his detriment. \"[W]here plain error has been committed and substantial rights have been affected thereby, the error may be noticed even though it was not brought to the attention of the trial court.\"\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12313068\" index=\"187\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/122/92/#p100\">\n    122 Hawai'i at 100\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12313068\" index=\"188\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/122/92/#p100\">\n    223 P.3d at 165\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation omitted). However, this court's principles of waiver remain the rule, to which plain error review is the exception.

I believe Hernandez invited this error, and it is therefore not reversible. This court qualified the invited error doctrine in\n   <em>\n    State v.

However, as I believe this \"error\" was not prejudicial and does not warrant plain error review (see\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   ), the general invited error rule should apply and the district court's \"error\" should not be reversed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   The Majority's holding is problematic because it enables a defendant who avails himself of a procedural maneuver at trial and benefits from that procedure to successfully challenge that procedure on appeal. Consistent with the longstanding invited error doctrine and Hernandez's failure to allege the error affected his substantial rights, we should not exercise our discretion to correct plain error when that \"error\" is a choice the defendant made for his own benefit. If it is clear from the record that the defendant wished to avail himself of a procedure, this court should not exercise plain error review when the defendant later changes his mind. Here, Hernandez clearly wished to avail himself of the HRPP Rule 43 plea by mail procedure. Thus, we should not exercise plain error review under these circumstances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Hernandez waived his right to engage in an on-the-record colloquy and his right of allocution.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   I believe that when Hernandez filed his HRPP Rule 43 plea by mail paperwork, he waived both his right to an on-the-record colloquy and his right of allocution. As such, neither right was violated when the district court did not engage him in a colloquy or\n   allow him the opportunity to speak before sentencing. \"A waiver is ordinarily an intentional relinquishment or abandonment of a known right or privilege.\"\n   <em>\n    Reponte v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1471994\" index=\"193\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/57/354/#p361\">\n    57 Haw. 354\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 361,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"194\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=556%20P.2d%20577\">\n    556 P.2d 577\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 583 (1976) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Johnson v.

The Majority holds that Hernandez did not waive his right of allocution because he was not specifically informed of that right. Majority at 19 n.13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   However, I believe the record shows Hernandez knew he was entitled to personally address the court, and that by choosing to be absent at all proceedings, he waived that right. The text of HRPP Rule 43 states \"\n   <em>\n    [e]xcept for the requirement of addressing the defendant personally in open court\n   </em>\n   , the court shall otherwise comply with the requirements of Rule 11 and Rule 32....\" HRPP Rule 43(d)(2)(B) (emphasis added). Furthermore, Hernandez's HRPP Rule 43 plea states \"I understand that I have the right to be present at the arraignment, at pretrial proceedings, at the time I enter my plea\n   <em>\n    and at my sentencing\n   </em>\n   . I voluntarily waive (give up) my right to be present at all of these proceedings ... I also give up my right to be questioned in open court.\" (emphasis added). Finally, defense counsel attached a declaration to the HRPP Rule 43 plea, stating, among other things, defense counsel \"explained the defendant's right to be present,\" and \"read and explained\" the HRPP Rule 43 plea to Hernandez. The record demonstrates Hernandez was aware of his right to engage with the court in person and knew he was waiving his right to be present at sentencing and at plea-entry, so he knowingly waived his right to engage with the court in person at both sentencing and plea-entry.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   The record also supports that Hernandez knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily entered the plea which waived his right to engage with the court in person. The HRPP Rule 43 plea indicates that Hernandez completed twelve years of education, was fluent in the English language, and understood the nature of the charge against him, the maximum penalty, that he had the right to plead not guilty, and the rights he was giving up by foregoing trial. The HRPP Rule 43 plea further supports that Hernandez pled of his own free will, that he was not coerced into pleading no contest, and that he was not promised any leniency or other benefit in exchange for his plea. Additionally, defense counsel's declaration indicates Hernandez understood the HRPP Rule 43 plea in its entirety, and that Hernandez \"does not wish to be present\" and \"wishes the proceedings to be conducted in [his] absence.\" The district court did not err in not personally engaging with Hernandez, because Hernandez waived both his right to engage in an on-the-record colloquy with the court and his right of allocution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   <strong>\n    III. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   I agree with the Majority's holding that Hernandez is not precluded from challenging his sentence by entry of his no contest plea. However, I do not believe the facts of this case justify the court's use of plain error review to vacate the district court's acceptance of Hernandez's plea. I further disagree with the Majority's holding that Hernandez's right of allocution was violated, because I believe Hernandez waived his right to address the court in person, both to engage in an on-the-record colloquy before entry of his plea, and to allocute before sentencing, when he chose to plead remotely pursuant to HRPP Rule 43.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   For these reasons, I would affirm the ICA's May 20, 2017 Judgment on Appeal.

And contrary to the dissent's contention, our holding will not lead Hawai'i judges to cease accepting Rule 43(d) pleas. Dissent at 143 Hawai'i at 519 n.5, 431 P.3d at 1292 n.5. Like the right of allocution, the court's colloquy obligation in misdemeanor cases within the scope of HRPP Rule 43(d) may be fulfilled through real-time electronic video communication. Such technology has become easily accessible-indeed ubiquitous-in the modern age through smartphones and other common consumer devices, dispelling any notion that offenders who have departed from the island where the offense is alleged to have been committed before their court date will be unable to appear remotely. Further, the use of video conferencing for arraignments is expressly authorized under the HRPP.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    HRPP Rule 10(d) (2014) (\"Arraignment in the circuit court shall be conducted in open court or by video conference when permitted by Rule 43.\"); HRPP Rule 43(e)(1)-(2)(A) (authorizing courts to conduct arraignment by video conference). Presence by video conference is also permitted with the consent of the defendant at a pre- or posttrial evidentiary hearing, a non-evidentiary proceeding, and a sentencing hearing.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    HRPP Rule 43(e)(2)(B)-(C), (e)(3).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-141\">\n    Notwithstanding this specific authorization in multiple situations, the dissent contends that appearing by video conference is not \"viable\" when a defendant is not in an \"institutional setting like a prison\" because \"authentication, identification, and confidentiality issues\" will make it too difficult to develop an \"accurate record.\" Dissent at 143 Hawai'i at 519 n.5, 431 P.3d at 1292 n.5. Yet it is not clear which of the assurances of a defendant's identity that are present when a defendant appears in person would be absent when the defendant instead appears by video conferencing, nor why the lack of such safeguards would undermine the memorialization of the record in the manner employed in any other proceeding. Moreover, the alternative procedure argued for by the dissent-under which courts would accept a defendant's guilty or no contest plea based on an out-of-court signature and submission of a document-contains far fewer assurances of the defendant's personal involvement and willingness to relinquish fundamental rights than when a court conducts a colloquy by video conference, and the alternative procedure would thus be more susceptible to the subsequent legal challenges the dissent appears to contemplate. To the extent the evidentiary concept of authentication applies to a video conference, it has not presented a significant enough obstacle to prevent our court rules from authorizing the technique in a variety of contexts in a criminal case without conditioning its use on the defendant's institutionalization. The same conclusion applies to the dissent's concern with \"identification[ ] and confidentiality issues,\" which have also not inhibited our broad endorsement of video conferencing under HRPP Rule 43.
