This is so because sometimes the child or parent may not be certain of their membership status in an Indian tribe, but may indicate they are somehow affiliated with a tribe or group of tribes. 2016 Guidelines at 18. To assist in identifying federally recognized tribes and their agents for service, the BIA publishes a list of recognized tribes and their agents in the Federal Register by region and by historical tribal affiliation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Designated Tribal Agents for Service of Notice,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=82%20Fed.%20Reg.%2012%2C986\">\n    82 Fed.

Thus, because ICWA's intent is to provide notice to tribes so that the tribes themselves can decide whether children are tribal members,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    B.H.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8403661\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/138/299/#p303\">\n    138 P.3d at 303-04\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , when a parent is unable to provide detailed information on potential tribal affiliations, the Department should provide notice to all identified tribes and the tribes that have been historically affiliated with those identified tribes,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Tribal Agents by Affiliation, https://perma.cc/K3DD-KQR5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   II. Analysis\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b6 9 Whether the notice requirements of ICWA were satisfied is a question of law that we review de novo.\n   <em>\n    People in Interest of T.M.W.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7332185\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/208/272/#p274\">\n    208 P.3d 272\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 274 (Colo. App. 2009).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b6 10 The record indicates that, after initially denying Native American heritage, mother informed the Department that her biological brother is registered with \"Navajo-Deni [sic].\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mother, however, was unable to provide a census number or any additional\n   information regarding how, or with whom, her brother was enrolled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b6 11 Upon learning that mother might have possible Native American heritage, the Division sent six separate notices to the Navajo Nation at six different addresses. The Navajo Nation responded that, based on the enrollment verification performed by the Navajo Office of Vital Records, there was no record of the family with the Navajo Nation, and, therefore, the child was not enrolled or eligible for enrollment with the Navajo Nation. Based on that response, the trial court found, at the termination hearing, that ICWA did not apply to this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b6 12 However, a review of the BIA's list of Tribal Agents by Affiliation shows that the Colorado River Indian Tribes are also tribes historically affiliated with the Navajo.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tribal Agents by Affiliation, https://perma.cc/K3DD-KQR5 (search for \"Colorado River Indian Tribes\" in the document). Therefore, because mother's statements regarding her possible Native American ancestry included a general reference to Navajo, and not just the Navajo Nation, we conclude that the Department was required to also notify the Colorado River Indian Tribes because it is recognized by the BIA as being historically affiliated with the Navajo.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b6 13 Since it appears from the record that the Department only provided notice to the Navajo Nation, we conclude that the notice given in this case was insufficient to satisfy ICWA's requirement. Accordingly, we remand the case to the trial court for the limited purpose of directing the Department to send appropriate notice to the Colorado River Indian Tribes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   III. Procedure on Remand\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b6 14 After receiving responses from the Colorado River Indian Tribes or the expiration of the timeframe under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201912\">\n    25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1912\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) or a reasonable additional time determined by the trial court, the court shall again enter factual findings and legal conclusions regarding the application of ICWA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b6 15 If the trial court determines that the child is an Indian child, within seven days of the issuance of the trial court's order making such determination, the Department must file notice with this court along with a copy of the trial court's order, and the appeal shall be recertified to permit a division of this court to issue an opinion vacating the termination judgment and remanding the case to the trial court with directions to proceed in accordance with ICWA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b6 16 If the trial court determines that the child is not an Indian child, within seven days of issuance of the trial court's order making such determination, the Department must file notice with this court along with a copy of the trial court's order, and the appeal shall be recertified. Within seven days of recertification, the Department must file either (1) a supplemental record consisting of the trial court's order on remand, a transcript of the proceedings on remand, and any notices sent and responses received; or (2) a supplemental designation of record of the same.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b6 17 Additionally, within fourteen days of recertification, mother may file a supplemental brief, not to exceed ten pages or 3500 words, limited to addressing the trial court's ICWA determination. If father, who is not currently a party to this appeal, wishes to file a brief addressing the ICWA determination, he may do so, but his brief must be accompanied by a notice of appeal indicating his intent to appeal from the ICWA determination. If either parent files a supplemental brief, the other parties may file, within fourteen days, supplemental briefs in response, not to exceed ten pages or 3500 words.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b6 18 This court further orders that the Department notify this court in writing of the status of the trial court proceedings in the\n   event that this matter is not concluded within twenty-eight days from the date of this order, and that the Department shall do so every twenty-eight days thereafter until the trial court issues its order on remand.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-40\">\n    \"Din\u00e9\" is a Navajo word meaning \"Navajo\" or \"the people.\"\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Leon Wall &amp; William Morgan,\n    <em>\n     Navajo-English Dictionary\n    </em>\n    29 (Bureau of Indian Affairs 1958), https://perma.cc/XF6Y-6LWH;\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     United States v.
