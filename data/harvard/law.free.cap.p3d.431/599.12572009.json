In an early morning of August 2016, an officer with the Tucson Police Department saw a truck parked in a secluded part of Fort Lowell Park several hours after the park had closed for the night. The officer approached the driver's door and saw a pipe on the center console that, based on his training and experience, was a type used only for \"smoking [il]licit substances.\" The officer handcuffed Green, the driver, and sat him in the back of his patrol car while he searched the truck, finding another similar pipe. The officer then removed Green from the patrol car, read him his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   rights, and arrested him for possession of one of the pipes. Although the officer intended to release Green after citing him for trespassing and possession of the pipe, he nevertheless returned Green to the patrol car in order to check whether he was in violation of federal immigration laws pursuant to Senate Bill 1070 and department policy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   A.R.S. \u00a7 11-1051.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 3 The check revealed no immigration issues and, when the officer removed Green from the car a second time, he saw a small plastic bag with a \"crystalized substance\" fall from Green's lap. The officer conducted a field test for narcotics, and the substance tested positive for the presence of illegal drugs. He then placed Green under custodial arrest. During a search of Green's person incident to that arrest, the officer found a plastic package with heroin and a container with morphine pills.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 4 Before trial, Green filed a motion to suppress the drug evidence, arguing his detention had been unreasonably prolonged after the officer had decided merely to cite and release him for trespassing and possession of the pipe. Following an evidentiary hearing, the trial court denied the motion, finding the length of the delay had not been unreasonable and, in any event, police had not \"gain[ed] any advantage\" from it. Following trial, the jury found Green guilty of the offenses as described above.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 5 Before sentencing, Green filed a motion arguing he was entitled to mandatory probation under \u00a7 13-901.01. Specifically, he urged that his 2006 conviction for solicitation to sell a narcotic drug was not a disqualifying prior conviction, or \"strike.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 13-901.01(H)(1). Following a hearing, the court denied the motion and sentenced Green to concurrent prison terms, the longest of which were six years. Green appealed; we have jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   A.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 13-4031, 13-4033(A)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    Unreasonable Delay\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 6 Green first argues the trial court erroneously denied his motion to suppress because, after the officer completed his investigation into the trespassing and paraphernalia offenses, he would not have discovered any controlled substances but for having\n   unlawfully prolonged the detention in order to complete an immigration check. We review a trial court's ruling on a motion to suppress for an abuse of discretion, but review constitutional and purely legal issues de novo.\n   <em>\n    State v.

Therefore, even assuming without deciding that he had no authority to conduct such a check, and that the bag would not have been discovered but for the delay caused thereby, the detention was not unlawfully prolonged. Moreover, Green cites no authority, and we are aware of none, indicating that once an officer subjectively intends to merely cite and release an arrestee, he must do so as soon as possible.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Whren v.
