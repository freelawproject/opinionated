The State charged her with second degree attempted murder. The court found her not guilty by reason of insanity in December 2005. After several years in treatment for paranoid schizophrenia at Western State Hospital, Coleman was conditionally released to the community in October 2009. Since then, she has lived in her own apartment and complied with the conditions of her release, all while under the supervision of Western State Hospital. She takes her medications regularly. Her paranoid schizophrenia is in remission when treated with medication. Coleman filed a petition for final release pursuant to RCW 10.77.200 in June 2016. Following a five-day evidentiary hearing in April 2017, the court denied her petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 5 Coleman appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <em>\n    ANALYSIS\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <em>\n    I. Appealability of Denial of a Final Release Petition\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 6 The threshold issue is whether the denial of Coleman's petition is appealable as a matter of right.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 7 RAP 2.2(a) lists superior court decisions appealable as a matter of right.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   RAP 2.2(a)(13), on which Coleman relies, allows an appeal of \"[a]ny final order made after judgment that affects a substantial right.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Appeal under this rule requires \"a showing of (1) effect on a substantial right and (2) finality.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The parties do not dispute the first requirement, so the issue is finality.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   A final judgment or order \"leaves 'nothing else to be done to arrive at the ultimate disposition of the petition.' \"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 8 Final release, which used to be called \"final discharge,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   is the \"legal termination of the court-ordered commitment under the provisions of this chapter.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   A patient may not be released \"except by order of a court ... made after a hearing and judgment of release.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 9 RCW 10.77.200 governs final release procedures. A person \"may petition the court at any time for [their final] release.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   No section of RCW 10.77 mandates that either the Department of Social and Health Services or the person petition for final release. If a petitioner shows by a preponderance of the evidence that she \"is no longer dangerous as a result of mental disease or that [s]he is no longer insane-then the [petitioner]\n   <em>\n    must\n   </em>\n   be unconditionally released.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 10 The State points to other sections in chapter 10.77 RCW that govern conditional release to argue against the finality of the court's decision. But final release and conditional release are drastically different.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   A petition for final release carries the possibility of finality, whereas a petition for conditional release does not.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   A person petitioning for conditional release remains under the court's jurisdiction regardless of the petition's disposition. A person on conditional release is subject to regular court monitoring, modification of her release conditions, and limitations on her liberties.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   But a successful petition for final release necessarily results in termination of any court jurisdiction over the person, leaving nothing else for the court to do.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 11 The State relies heavily on\n   <em>\n    In re Detention of Petersen\n   </em>\n   to argue against Coleman's right to appeal, but\n   <em>\n    Petersen\n   </em>\n   is inapposite because it addresses interlocutory circumstances akin to a petition for conditional release.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   In\n   <em>\n    Petersen\n   </em>\n   , our Supreme Court considered whether denial of a probable cause hearing, a statutorily-required hearing prior to an unconditional release hearing, was appealable as a matter of right.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court concluded the decision was not appealable under RAP 2.2(a)(13) because the finding\n   of no probable cause \"is not a final order after judgment in light of the court's continuing jurisdiction over the [patient] until their unconditional release.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   Only discretionary review was available \"[i]n light of the nature of the show cause hearing required by RCW 71.09.090(2).\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   But the court strongly suggested that a decision on the merits of unconditional release is appealable as a matter of right:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   [A]lthough we do not now so decide, review of decisions made after a full hearing on the merits under RCW 71.09.090(2) would be reviewable as of right. Such hearings appear to be equivalent to whole new trials with the same procedural protections as the initial commitment trial.\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b6 12 Consistent with the\n   <em>\n    Petersen\n   </em>\n   court's suggestion, RCW 10.77.120(2) presumes the State's ability to appeal adverse rulings on petitions for final release:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   If the [S]tate\n   <em>\n    appeals\n   </em>\n   an order of [final] release, such appeal shall operate as a stay, and the person shall remain in custody and be returned to the institution or facility designated by the secretary until a final decision has been rendered in the cause.\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   An order granting final release ends the court's jurisdiction over the patient, consistent with legislative contemplation of a release order as a final ruling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b6 13 The State also compares this case to\n   <em>\n    In re Dependency of Chubb\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   and\n   <em>\n    State v. Howland\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n   but neither is compelling. In\n   <em>\n    Chubb\n   </em>\n   , a parent appealed dependency review orders, not the dependency order or parental rights termination, and our Supreme Court concluded they were not appealable pursuant to RAP 2.2.\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n   The dependency review orders were interlocutory because the review hearings occurred automatically as part of an ongoing process.\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n   Similarly, in\n   <em>\n    Howland\n   </em>\n   , a trial court's denial of a patient's petition for conditional release was not appealable under RAP 2.2(a)(13) because it was not a final order.\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n   Even if the trial court had granted the patient's conditional release petition, it would have retained jurisdiction and disposed only of the petition itself.\n   <footnotemark>\n    27\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b6 14 Here, Coleman appeals a decision based on a five-day evidentiary hearing on the merits of her petition. Coleman would not be under any court's jurisdiction if her petition were granted. And RCW 10.77.200 does not provide for routine monitoring of Coleman's readiness for release nor does it require a preliminary hearing before a full evidentiary hearing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    28\n   </footnotemark>\n   Moreover, the statute contemplates grant of a release petition as a final, appealable decision.\n   <footnotemark>\n    29\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b6 15 Similarly, in\n   <em>\n    State v. Gossage\n   </em>\n   , this court concluded a trial court order denying a sex offender's petition for a certificate of discharge was appealable as a matter of right.\n   <footnotemark>\n    30\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court rejected as inapt the State's analogy to\n   <em>\n    Petersen\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Chubb\n   </em>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    31\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court upheld the offender's right to appeal because no court would have had continuing jurisdiction over the offender if his petition were granted and because no statute required routine monitoring to determine whether termination of ongoing court jurisdiction was warranted.\n   <footnotemark>\n    32\n   </footnotemark>\n   The same analysis\n   applies to a petition for final release of a person found not guilty by reason of insanity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b6 16 The State contended at oral argument that it may appeal the grant of a final release as a matter of right, implicitly conceding that a decision on a final release petition is a final judgment, but suggested that an unsuccessful petitioner could not appeal as a matter of right the denial of a final release. The State provides no authority for this one-sided approach. An order granting or denying the petition for final release leaves \" 'nothing else to be done to arrive at the ultimate disposition of the petition.' \"\n   <footnotemark>\n    33\n   </footnotemark>\n   Coleman is appealing a final order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b6 17 Accordingly, we follow the reasoning in\n   <em>\n    Gossage\n   </em>\n   and conclude that the trial court's order dismissing a petition for final release is appealable as a matter of right pursuant to RAP 2.2(a)(13).\n   <footnotemark>\n    34\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <em>\n    II. Substantial Evidence Supports the Court's Essential Findings of Fact\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b6 18 The main, narrow issue presented by Coleman on the merits is whether we should reverse the court's denial of her petition and remand for reconsideration if, as she contends, 7 of its 58 factual findings are unsupported by the record.\n   <footnotemark>\n    35\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b6 19 Our review is limited to determining whether substantial evidence supports the challenged findings of fact and, in turn, if the supported findings and unchallenged findings support the court's conclusions of law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    36\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"Evidence is substantial if it is sufficient to convince a reasonable person of the truth of the finding.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    37\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"So long as this substantial evidence standard is met, 'a reviewing court will not substitute its judgment for that of the trial court even though it might have resolved a factual dispute differently.' \"\n   <footnotemark>\n    38\n   </footnotemark>\n   Even if a trial court relies on erroneous or unsupported findings of fact, immaterial findings that do not affect its conclusions of law are not prejudicial and do not warrant reversal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    39\n   </footnotemark>\n   Unchallenged findings of fact are verities on appeal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    40\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b6 20 Coleman challenges findings of fact based on testimony given by three doctors who testified at her final release hearing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    41\n   </footnotemark>\n   Dr. Kevin Peterson is an independent psychologist who testified on Coleman's behalf. Dr. Haley Gummelt is a psychologist\n   at Western State Hospital who recently evaluated Coleman as part of her petition for final release. Dr. Daniel Ruiz-Parades is an administrator and psychiatrist at Western State Hospital who chairs the committee that makes recommendations regarding final release.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b6 21 Coleman challenges a portion of finding of fact 18, that \"Dr. Peterson found Ms. Coleman at a low risk to reoffend so long as she maintains her compliance with medication and the treatment/housing structure ... in place.\" Dr. Peterson assessed Coleman as being a low clinical risk because \"she is in treatment\" and \"connected with a good program.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    42\n   </footnotemark>\n   But he noted it is generally very common for individuals experiencing paranoid schizophrenia to stop taking their medication. Dr. Peterson also testified that Coleman could voluntarily opt out of treatment services following release and, if she \"stops medication, if she stops treatment, if she stops things that are keeping her oriented and stable, yes, of course, her risk goes up.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    43\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because this testimony is sufficient to convince a reasonable person of the truth of the court's finding that Coleman is low risk so long as she takes her medication and continues with treatment and housing services, the finding is supported by substantial evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b6 22 Coleman objects to finding of fact 19 in its entirety:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   On cross-examination, Dr. Peterson testified that if Ms. Coleman loses the treatment/housing structure ... and decompensates, she will become a substantial danger. He also testified that Ms. Coleman's chronic paranoid schizophrenia is currently in remission, but may become active[,] rendering Coleman a danger to others.\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    44\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   This particular finding summarizes the testimony of Dr. Peterson. Dr. Peterson testified if Coleman becomes medication noncompliant and decompensates, then \"I don't know if she becomes a substantial risk, but the risk increases. ... She could, in fact, [become extremely dangerous] if somebody wants to be focused on that, yes. ... If she becomes dangerous, she becomes a substantial risk, yes.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    45\n   </footnotemark>\n   Viewed in conjunction with the evidence supporting finding of fact 18, substantial evidence supports finding of fact 19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b6 23 Coleman also challenges finding 20:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   Like Dr. Peterson, Dr. Gummelt also found Ms. Coleman to be a low risk to reoffend should [the treatment provider] continue case and medication management. Dr. Gummelt testified that should she lose this structure and decompensate, Ms. Coleman will become a substantial risk to public safety.\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    46\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The first sentence is unsupported by the record, and the State concedes the second sentence is inaccurate. Dr. Gummelt did not testify that Coleman's low risk of reoffense was connected to case management. In fact, Dr. Gummelt's written evaluation of Coleman stated, \"If [ongoing case and medication management] were to be discontinued or altered, her risk for future violence may or may not be affected.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    47\n   </footnotemark>\n   , Substantial evidence does not support finding of fact 20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00b6 24 However, this error does not justify remand. Finding of fact 20 explicitly echoes findings of fact 18 and 19, which are supported by Dr. Peterson's testimony. Even without finding of fact 20, the court could have relied on findings of fact 18 and 19 to reach the same legal conclusion on the same evidentiary basis, albeit one provided by a different expert.\n   <footnotemark>\n    48\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, the error is immaterial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b6 25 Coleman disputes part of finding of fact 22, that \"[b]oth Dr. Peterson and Dr. Gummelt were of the opinion that Ms. Coleman lacks personal support in the community, which is a risk factor of concern.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    49\n   </footnotemark>\n   Although Coleman is correct that Dr. Gummelt did not share this opinion with Dr. Peterson,\n   <footnotemark>\n    50\n   </footnotemark>\n   this error is immaterial because substantial evidence supports the disputed part of the finding. Dr. Peterson described Coleman's \"lack of personal supports\" as \"a weakness,\" and noted that Coleman has difficulty engaging with her family because they live far away.\n   <footnotemark>\n    51\n   </footnotemark>\n   In addition, his written evaluation states, \"She has attended peer support groups ... but doesn't socialize outside groups with other patients much.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    52\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because this error is immaterial, no relief is warranted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   \u00b6 26 Coleman objects to finding of fact 25 in which the court again compares Dr. Peterson's and Dr. Gummelt's testimony:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   Dr. Peterson and Dr. Gummelt also expressed concern regarding Ms. Coleman's lack of employment. Both doctors expressed concern [about] whether Ms. Coleman would be able to obtain or maintain employment and simultaneously manage her psychotic symptoms.\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    53\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Dr. Gummelt evaluated Coleman and wrote, \"[I]t is unclear whether she would be able to maintain employment and manage her psychiatric symptoms.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    54\n   </footnotemark>\n   Dr. Peterson did not share this concern. As with finding of fact 22, this is an immaterial error because substantial evidence supported the finding as to one testifying expert, and that portion of the finding supports the court's conclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   \u00b6 27 The last two objections are to factual findings 54(d) and 54(f), which are based on the testimony of Dr. Ruiz-Parades.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   \u00b6 28 The first finding is \"Sooner or later, a person diagnosed with chronic [p]aranoid [s]chizophrenia would relapse.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    55\n   </footnotemark>\n   Dr. Ruiz-Parades stated at least four times during his testimony that relapse is common for individuals experiencing paranoid schizophrenia. He stated directly, \"It is part of the nature of [chronic paranoid schizophrenia ] that almost [every patient] always [has] relapses sooner or later,\" and that \"[t]here are concerns about well-being and safety [b]ecause the nature of the current risks for schizophrenia is one for relapses.\n   <footnotemark>\n    56\n   </footnotemark>\n   Substantial evidence supports this finding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   \u00b6 29 The second finding states, \"The efficacy of medication would change over time and could cause an acute relapse of symptoms.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    57\n   </footnotemark>\n   Dr. Ruiz-Parades testified about long-term medication efficacy:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   Another scenario is that the person may become refractory to the medication. And it happens that the Medication A has worked very well for a number of years [but] at some point in time is no longer effective.

The finding is supported by substantial evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   \u00b6 30 The court concluded as a matter of law that Coleman \"requires continued supervision by [Western State Hospital] and the court.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    59\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, the court denied Coleman's petition. This conclusion was supported by six of the findings of fact discussed above and by the court's unchallenged findings, particularly findings of fact 56 and 57:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   56.
