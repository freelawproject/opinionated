Representing himself, French challenged the citation in Sanders County Justice Court. The jury found him guilty, and he appealed to the Twentieth Judicial District Court, Sanders County. French also appeared on his own behalf in the District Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 4 Prior to trial, French filed a \"Motion to Dismiss Due to Lack of Particularized Suspicion,\" arguing in part that: (1) he was not speeding, and Trooper Rehbein may not be credible; (2) there was no particularized suspicion for the stop because it was based solely on Trooper Rehbein's uncorroborated account of what happened; and (3) the state and federal constitutions require two witnesses to testify for a conviction. French filed multiple briefs in support of his theories of law, arguing in part that the Bible, the Montana Constitution, and the United States Constitution require more than one witness to testify against a defendant.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The District Court denied the motion to dismiss, reasoning that: (1) as the trier of fact, the jury would weigh the credibility of Trooper Rehbein's testimony and decide whether French was speeding; (2) the evidence supported particularized suspicion for the stop; and (3) neither the Montana Constitution nor the United States Constitution required the testimony of multiple witnesses to convict a person.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 5 The District Court subsequently granted the State's motion in limine to preclude French from calling any witnesses or attempting to elicit testimony regarding his theories of what the law is or mention his theories of law in front of the jury panel. The District Court denied French's request for reconsideration based on the historical references in the Bible and Roman law of the requirement of two or more witnesses for criminal prosecution, and held that French could not to argue this theory to the jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 6 Trooper Rehbein was the only witness at French's trial. He was patrolling in Sanders County on March 8, 2006, at approximately ten o'clock p.m., when he observed a vehicle that appeared to be speeding. Trooper Rehbein activated his radar and \"checked their speed at 80\n   miles an hour.\" The speed limit was sixty-five miles per hour. He stopped the vehicle and asked the driver for his license, proof of insurance, and registration. The driver, French, provided his vehicle registration to Trooper Rehbein, but he did not have a driver's license or proof of insurance in his possession. Trooper Rehbein issued French a citation for speeding. Trooper Rehbein testified that the radar was functioning properly and that the Highway Patrol does not have the capability to connect the radar to his dash-camera system. He further testified that, customary with his practice, after completing the stop he ran his radar through a self-test to ensure it was working properly and created a \"speed device log.\" The radar machine Trooper Rehbein used could not produce any type of printout of the clocked speed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 7 The jury found French guilty of speeding in violation of \u00a7 61-8-303(1)(b), MCA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARDS OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 8 We may review claimed errors not objected to at trial that implicate an accused's fundamental rights, where failing to review the claimed error may result in a manifest miscarriage of justice, may leave unsettled the question of the fundamental fairness of the trial proceedings, or may compromise the integrity of the judicial process.\n   <em>\n    State v.

Did the District Court err when it did not dismiss the case for lack of particularized suspicion and for lack of corroborating evidence?\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b6 12 French first argues that the District Court erred when it denied\n   his pretrial motion to dismiss for lack of particularized suspicion. French maintains that in addition to witness testimony, particularized suspicion must be supported by independent corroborating evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b6 13 A police officer may stop a vehicle that \"is observed in circumstances that create a particularized suspicion that the person or occupant of the vehicle has committed, is committing, or is about to commit an offense.\" Section 46-5-401(1), MCA. To satisfy the requirement of particularized suspicion, the State must show that the officer had \"(1) objective data and articulable facts from which an experienced officer can make certain inferences, and (2) a resulting suspicion that the occupant of [the] vehicle is or has been engaged in wrongdoing.\"\n   <em>\n    Sharp\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 7 (internal citation omitted). Objective data means facts that are observable and articulable and an awareness of the circumstances of an individual's conduct.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sharp\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 10. If an officer observes a vehicle speeding, he has particularized suspicion to perform an investigatory stop.\n   <em>\n    Sharp\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b6 14 Trooper Rehbein articulated that he stopped French based on his visual observation and on the radar confirmation. Contrary to French's contention that there is no \"objective criteria\" because Trooper Rehbein's testimony is uncorroborated, Trooper Rehbein articulated objective facts-his experienced observation of a speeding vehicle and radar confirmation of the vehicle's speed. A review of the full record supports the court's finding of particularized suspicion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sharp\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 9. The District Court thus correctly denied French's motion to dismiss for lack of particularized suspicion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b6 15 Although he made no motion at trial, French argues further that the District Court should have dismissed the case\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   after Trooper Rehbein testified because his testimony was uncorroborated. French maintains that for a conviction, Trooper Rehbein's testimony must be corroborated by \"objective data,\" such as a print-out from the radar or video of the speed shown on the radar.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b6 16 The testimony of a single witness the jury finds credible \"is sufficient for proof of any fact, except perjury and treason.\" Section 26-1-301, MCA ;\n   <em>\n    State v.

The District Court properly submitted the\n   case to the jury based on Trooper Rehbein's testimony, and it did not err by failing to dismiss\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   for lack of corroborating evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b6 18\n   <em>\n    2. Does the State's comment to the jury that French already had been convicted of the charge in the Justice Court require reversal?\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b6 19 French told the jury in his closing argument that \"the State thinks this issue is important. We've had two trials. This is the second trial over this issue.\" He stated, \"If there's a mistrial, it goes back into the hands of the State, and then the State will decide whether to have a third trial. Or just drop it.\" The prosecutor argued in rebuttal, \"Oh, the State will try me three times. Yeah, we tried him once, we convicted him, and he appealed up here. That's why we're up here for a second [trial].\" French did not object.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b6 20 French argues that the State's comment that he previously had been convicted of speeding was \"inappropriate\" and \"prejudicial\" and would likely \"inflame the jury against the defendant.\" The State concedes that the prosecutor's comment at closing argument \"amounts to testimony on prejudicial facts not before the jury's consideration.\" The State agrees that plain error review is appropriate for this issue and that French is entitled to a new trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b6 21 A prosecutor may not comment about the guilt of an accused because, among other reasons, \"a prosecutor's expression of guilt invades the province of the jury and is an usurpation of its function to declare the guilt or innocence of the accused.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

Trooper Rehbein testified that the Montana Code Annotated \"are the laws [he is] accountable to uphold.\" French further asked if he \"swore an oath of office to uphold Montana Code Annotated,\" and Trooper Rehbein answered, \"Yes, sir.\" French then offered into evidence a copy of \u00a7 2-16-211, MCA, as the oath sworn by all public officers. The District Court denied admitting a copy of the statute into evidence because it did not find it relevant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b6 26 French argues that the District Court abused its discretion by excluding his proposed exhibit. French argues that the statute would have put Trooper Rehbein's credibility into question because he stated that his oath was to uphold the Montana Code Annotated, and the statute is an oath to defend the federal and Montana constitutions. French did not, however, explain his purpose for the exhibit at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b6 27 The trial court has broad discretion in determining the relevance and admissibility of evidence.\n   <em>\n    State v.

Noting that the proposed instruction was a statement of the Constitution, the District Court acknowledged that French wished to have something in the instructions about \"witnesses in the plural.\" It denied the instruction, however, because it already had ruled as a matter of law that one witness is sufficient to prove any fact.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   \u00b6 31 French maintains that the District Court abused its discretion in refusing his proposed jury instruction.
