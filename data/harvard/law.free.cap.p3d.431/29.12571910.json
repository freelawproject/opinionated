The Agreement provided that Trademark would supply the labor and materials for the framing, roofing, and siding of the home.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b64 Nathan Judd (\"Judd\"), a primary owner of Trademark and a contractor, is an acquaintance of the Jorgensens and submitted a bid on behalf of Trademark to acquire the job.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b65 The Agreement was silent as to who would assume the role of general contractor. Both parties believed this role would fall to the Jorgensens, as Tim Jorgensen was an experienced contractor and Trademark was contracted for only specific aspects of the construction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b66 Early on, the relationship between Judd and the Jorgensens began to deteriorate. Judd felt that the Jorgensens were causing unnecessary delays in the project and that he was being forced to \"assum[e] a role left vacant\" by the Jorgensens, whom he expected would act as the general contractors on the site. The Jorgensens dispute that Judd was acting as general contractor and assert that Judd was responsible only for his subcontractors in accordance with the Agreement. The Jorgensens also maintain that Judd failed to adequately perform his obligations under the contract and charged excessively for his work.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b67 On September 28, 2015, after a series of disagreements and miscommunications, Judd sent the Jorgensens an email: \"If you feel like your [sic] being taken advantage of, mislead, or mistreated I apologize. I'll be happy to finish the framing phase and turn the reigns\n   [sic] over if you'd like. Please let me know on how you'd like us to proceed.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b68 In her response, Kiri inquired about Judd's on-site work schedule for the upcoming weeks and asked him to clarify exactly what he considered the \"framing phase\" of the job to entail. Judd responded: \"The framing phase would be the erection of the structure. Myself and/or my crew will be onsite mon-Friday [sic] until the framing is complete.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b69 On October 19, 2015, when the framing phase was near completion, the Jorgensens emailed Judd: \"On September 28, after a previous round of negativity, you offered to 'finish the framing phase and turn the reigns [sic] over if you'd like.' On account of your continued actions and behavior, we have elected to take you up on this offer.\" They then asked Judd for a detailed accounting of the money spent and expenses paid. At this point, Judd estimated the framing was 95% finished.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b610 Following this exchange, Trademark ceased all work and did not return to the jobsite.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b611 The Jorgensens disagreed with Judd as to the accuracy of Trademark's final accounting. In December 2015, the Jorgensens filed their Complaint alleging breach of contract, bad faith, and, in the alternative, rescission. Trademark denied the allegations and counterclaimed alleging breach of contract and bad faith.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b612 Following a bench trial, the District Court dismissed Trademark's counterclaims, held that the Agreement was rescinded, ordered Trademark to pay the Jorgensens $19,977.19 in restitution damages, and awarded\n   the Jorgensens $27,475 in attorney's fees.

Thus, Trademark argues, Judd sent the email to relinquish Trademark's role as de facto general contractor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   However, the context of Judd's email is more consistent with an offer to rescind: Judd expressed his regret for the situation, explained that he was losing money on the project, and apologized for any ill will.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b622 Additionally, Judd's response email and Trademark's conduct following the exchange demonstrate that Judd was offering to terminate their contractual relationship. When asked what Judd meant by the \"framing phase,\" Judd responded: \"The framing phase would be the erection of the structure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Myself and/or the crew will be onsite mon-Friday [sic] until the framing is complete.\" If Trademark intended to continue building pursuant to the contract it would be untenable to then state it would leave as soon as framing was complete-when a substantial portion of construction on the home remained. Further, Trademark's full accounting after the acceptance did not include work done as general contractor. The accounting only documented work done pursuant to the Agreement. When Trademark offered to turn over the reins to the Jorgensens, it was a clear offer to rescind the Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b623 The Jorgensens also interpreted Judd's email as an offer to rescind the Agreement. They found this offer \"attractive\" considering the turbulent relationship that had developed. Accordingly, when they accepted the offer on October 19, they believed that the Agreement would be rescinded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b624 The Jorgensen's acceptance was also timely. Trademark asserts that even if the September 28 email was an offer to rescind, that offer would have lapsed considering that Trademark commenced window and roof installation without objection from the Jorgensens. According to Trademark, the fact that Trademark commenced construction apart from framing indicates that the parties did not agree to rescission. We agree with the District Court that additional work completed outside of the framing should not be considered a revocation of the offer to rescind because it was originally mentioned that other work would go forward unless the Jorgensens accepted the offer to rescind. The Jorgensens compensated Trademark for this additional work and accepted the offer as it was presented in Trademark's September 28 email.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b625 Trademark also emphasizes the fact that the Jorgensens did not accept the offer until three weeks after it was presented. The Jorgensens testified that they were holding out hope that their relationship with Trademark would improve and only accepted the offer when they realized that this was unlikely.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b626 The timing of the acceptance was reasonable because it occurred when the framing phase was near completion and before Trademark\n   revoked the offer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b627 When viewed in the light most favorable to the Jorgensens, the record supports the District Court's finding that the Jorgensens and Trademark mutually agreed to rescind the Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \u00b628 Trademark next asserts that the District Court's finding of rescission was improper because neither Trademark nor the Jorgensens attempted to restore one another to their pre-contract positions and because it was impossible for the parties to be restored to their pre-contract positions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00b629 Mutual rescission of a contract can occur at any stage of performance.\n   <em>\n    Small v.
