With no Protestants filing objections, we approve the bonds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   \u00b6 2 Since the 1950's, this Court has approved several bonds requested by the Authority. In 2017, the Oklahoma Legislature passed the Oklahoma Local Public and Private Facilities and Infrastructure Act (the Act), 74 O.S. Supp. 2017 \u00a7\u00a7 5151 et. seq.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The purpose of the Act is to facilitate public-private partnerships to improve public services.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b6 3 Even though the Authority is exempted from the Act, the Act does provide that the Authority may utilize the general provisions and processes of the Act to develop public-private partnership agreements.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The purpose the agreements is to facilitate the construction and operation of various turnpike projects throughout the state. One such project is the proposal at issue here. The Gilcrease Expressway, the project presented here, is part of an original more than 50 year-old master plan for Tulsa, Oklahoma. The project will be four lanes, approximately 5 miles in length, serving west and north Tulsa. It will connect Interstate 44 and U.S. Highway 412, operating as an all-electronic toll collection system.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 4 Financing for the project will come from the issuance of revenue bonds or a TIFIA loan, secured by and payable from revenues generated by the project. Additional financial commitments are also made by the Authority, the Oklahoma Department of Transportation, and the City of Tulsa utilizing a combination of: 1) long term debt, payable from project revenues in the form of a loan from the United States Department of Transportation (USDOT) under the Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (TIFIA)\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   ; 2) $71,123,068 of bond proceeds from the \"Grant Anticipation Notes (GARVEEs) issued and payable by ODOT; and 3) a contribution from the Authority's general fund. This project is described as a component of the \"Driving Forward\" program announced by the Governor in 2015. It is generally designed to expand and modernize the Authority's Turnpike Projects and improve safety throughout the state.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 5 There are no Protestants to this cause. Consequently, no one presents any legal authority showing that this project is a violation of the Oklahoma Constitution or any statutes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Nor does it appear that the Authority exceeded its authority as authorized by law, or that the Bonds appear to facially violate the law. Pursuant to\n   <em>\n    IntheMatterofApplicationoftheOklahomaTurnpikeAuthority\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12337975\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/389/318/\">\n    2016 OK 124\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 15,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12337975\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/389/318/\">\n    389 P.3d 318\n   </extracted-citation>\n   we need not engage in further research.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   The applicant explains that the bond financing procurement in this proposal cannot create an unlawful partnership interest in contravention to the Okla. Const. art. 10, \u00a7 15\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   because at no time will the Authority enter into a joint venture or acquire a partnership or other ownership interest in a private entity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 6 Rather, the Authority will oversee construction and provide inspection. Upon completion\n   it will be the owner of the project, and solely responsible for operating and maintaining the new turnpike. It will also establish the applicable rates and charges for use by the public.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 7 The proposed bond issue was properly authorized as an essential governmental function.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Valid notice of this application was given.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   No Protestants have come forward, therefore, there is no legally or factually supportable reasons to disapprove the application. Accordingly, the Authority's application is granted. Rehearing, if any, shall follow Okla. Sup. Ct.
