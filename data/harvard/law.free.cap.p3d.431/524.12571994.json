Lackey argues the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the dispute and erred by concluding the requirements of a prescriptive easement had been satisfied. Tiller argues the trial court erred by refusing to recognize an easement by necessity over the road. We hold that the court had subject matter jurisdiction and that the trial court erred by concluding the requirements of a prescriptive easement were satisfied but the requirements of an implied easement by necessity were not. We conclude the trial court's findings support recognizing an implied easement by necessity. We remand to the trial court for entry of revised conclusions of law consistent with this opinion and a revised judgment that specifies the easement is an implied easement rather than a prescriptive easement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   FACTS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 2 In June 1945, Noel and Eileen Provanche recorded the Plat of Georgia Point (plat), which the Provanches created from part of a larger parcel of property they owned on the north end of Lake Whatcom. The plat consisted of 10 contiguous waterfront lots, with lot 1 at the west end of the plat and lot 10 at the east end. The plat also included an additional parcel (street parcel), which was dedicated as a \"private street reserved for the use of the owners of the Lots within the boundaries of [the] plat,\" solely for street purposes. The owner of each lot within the plat holds an undivided one-tenth interest in the street parcel, which consists of a 30-foot-wide strip of land that abuts the northern boundaries of lots 1 through 10. The street parcel spans the entire width of the plat, so that its western end extends west to, and is flush with, the western boundary of lot 1, and its eastern end extends east to, and is flush with, the eastern boundary of lot 10. When the plat was recorded, an active railroad right-of-way separated the northern boundary of the street parcel from North Shore Road, the main road along that part of Lake Whatcom.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 3 Appellants Steven and Sally Lackey now own lot 10 (the easternmost lot) of the plat. Appellants Casey and Karen O'Keefe own lot 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 4 In July 1949, the Provanches \"carved out\" and sold a piece of property (cabin lot) from their remaining property to the east of the plat. The cabin lot is not contiguous to the plat, and the Provanches retained ownership of the land separating the plat from the cabin lot. A ravine and seasonal stream separated the cabin lot from the Provanches' remaining property to the east of the cabin lot, and there is no evidence that the cabin lot has ever been accessed from the east.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 5 When the Provanches sold the cabin lot, they granted and recorded an easement (cabin lot easement) across the property they retained between the plat and the cabin lot. This property is now owned by David and Thuy Tiller and is referred to herein as the \"Tiller lot.\" The cabin lot easement burdened the Tiller lot in favor of the cabin lot \"for road purposes\" for access to the cabin lot. The original cabin lot easement abutted the street parcel to the west at the eastern boundary of the plat and mirrored the street parcel's 30 foot width and its path. In other words, the original cabin lot easement, if drawn on a map, appears as a continuation of the street parcel from the eastern boundary of lot 10, across the Tiller lot, to the western boundary of the cabin lot. In 1959, the width of the cabin lot easement was reduced from its original 30 feet to 12 feet as the result of a lawsuit between the then-owners of the Tiller lot and the cabin lot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 6 By 1947, a railroad crossing from North Shore Road to the plat (crossing) had been installed at approximately the boundary between lots 8 and 9. The extent of road installation within the street parcel at that time is unclear. However, there is evidence that by 1950, a road (Lakeview Street) had been installed within the street parcel. From the south end of the crossing, Lakeview Street branched off both west, toward lot 1, and east, toward lots 9 and 10 and the cabin lot. Figure 1 below depicts, for illustrative purposes, the plat (including the street parcel), the railroad right-of-way, North Shore Road, the Tiller lot, the cabin lot, and the cabin lot easement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Figure 1 also depicts the approximate location of the crossing, as well as another railroad crossing to the east that was used to access the Provanches' remaining property to the east of the cabin lot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <em>\n    Figure 1\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 7 By 1976, the railroad right-of-way had been abandoned, and in August 1976, the then-owners of the lots within the plat purchased the right-of-way that had separated the street parcel from North Shore Road. The then-owners of the cabin lot and the Tiller lot did the same. Over time, some lot owners within the plat have installed crossings from their lots directly to North Shore Road across this abandoned railroad right-of-way. However, up until the time that Tiller purchased the Tiller lot in 2004, together with the portion of the abandoned railroad right-of-way between the Tiller lot from North Shore Road, the only vehicular access to the Tiller lot and the cabin lot was via Lakeview Street.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 8 At some point before selling the Tiller lot to Tiller, Tiller's immediate predecessors opened a path directly to North Shore Road from the Tiller lot, but it was not passable for an ordinary vehicle, nor was it ever formally approved by the county or used as a primary access to the Tiller lot. After acquiring the Tiller lot in 2004, Tiller continued using the crossing and Lakeview Street to access the Tiller lot from North Shore Road.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 9 In July 2014, Lackey notified Tiller that Lackey intended to terminate Tiller's use of Lakeview Street. Tiller filed a quiet title action on July 25, 2014, claiming a prescriptive easement to continue using Lakeview Street to access the Tiller lot. Tiller later amended the complaint to add claims for easement implied by prior use and easement implied from necessity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 10 At trial, multiple witnesses who once lived in or around the plat testified that Lakeview Street was the only route ever used to access the Tiller lot and the cabin lot from North Shore Road. Witnesses also testified that they were not aware of any owners of those lots ever asking, or needing to ask, permission to use Lakeview Street to access the Tiller lot or the cabin lot. Connie Myrhe, who lived on lot 9 from 1963 to approximately 1989, testified that permission was \"just assumed.\" Karen Walter, who once lived on the Tiller lot, testified that she did not recall ever having any discussion in the neighborhood about a need to obtain permission to use Lakeview Street, saying, \"[N]obody cared. It was just the way it was.\" Another witness testified about the direct access to North Shore Road that had been installed by Tiller's immediate predecessors, stating that\n   he did not believe even his four-wheel-drive pickup would be able to drive that access to the bottom (south) portion of the Tiller lot. This witness also testified that the grade from the abandoned railroad right-of-way portion of the property to the bottom portion of the Tiller lot is fairly steep.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 11 David Tiller testified that when he and his wife purchased the Tiller lot, they initially planned to develop direct access from North Shore Road to the bottom portion of the property, where they planned to construct a new residence. But they later abandoned that plan due to impracticality resulting from the steepness of the slope, as well as a 2007 lawsuit by the owners of the cabin lot to keep the cabin lot easement open. Tiller later constructed a garage on the former railroad right-of-way portion of the property with direct access to North Shore Road. But access to the lower part of the Tiller lot remained via the crossing and Lakeview Street.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 12 The trial court entered extensive findings of fact and conclusions of law. The court concluded that Tiller had established a prescriptive easement for ingress and egress via Lakeview Street to the western boundary of the Tiller lot, but that the requirements of an implied easement had not been met. Lackey appeals. Tiller cross appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   I.\n   <em>\n    Subject Matter Jurisdiction\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b6 13 Whether a court has subject matter jurisdiction is a question of law reviewed de novo.\n   <em>\n    Dougherty v.

Accordingly, the trial court had subject matter jurisdiction over this dispute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b6 16 Because the trial court had subject matter jurisdiction, Lackey's argument that Tiller should have followed statutory plat amendment procedures fails.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    MHM&amp;F, LLC v.

The trial court concluded that access via the street parcel to these otherwise landlocked lots was necessary in 1949 and 1953. But the trial court concluded that the unity-and-severance element was not satisfied at those\n   times because the Provanches had already severed their interest in the plat, including the street parcel, by the time they created the cabin lot in 1949. In other words, by 1949, there was no unity of title between the street parcel and the Provanches' remaining property to the east of the plat. Accordingly, the trial court concluded, no easement burdening the street parcel could have arisen by implication as of 1949 or 1953.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   \u00b6 50 Although this analysis would be correct if 1949 and 1953 were the relevant foci for the inquiry, they are not. Instead, the proper focus for the implied easement analysis is June 27, 1947. This is the date on which the Provanches sold the last lot in the plat and thereby severed the unity of title between the plat, including the street parcel, and their remaining property to the east of the plat.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   \u00b6 51 To this end, the trial court did conduct an implied easement analysis as of June 27, 1947, and acknowledged that unity of title as between the plat and the Provanches' remaining property was severed on that date. But the trial court concluded that the necessity element of the implied easement analysis was not satisfied at that time because the Tiller lot and the cabin lot did not exist as independent or separate lots within the Provanches' remaining property to the east of the plat. In other words, although there was unity followed by a subsequent severance between the plat (including the street parcel) and the Provanches' remaining property on June 27, 1947, the trial court concluded that no easement could be implied,\n   <em>\n    solely\n   </em>\n   because the land that now comprises the Tiller lot and the cabin lot was still part of a larger parcel of property owned by the Provanches at that time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   \u00b6 52 Lackey cites no Washington authority to support the trial court's conclusion that an easement may not be implied for ingress and egress to a portion of a larger parcel of property to which some access exists after severance.

Specifically, we consider whether at the time of severance, there was a reasonable necessity for an easement burdening the street parcel to secure and maintain the quiet enjoyment of the portion of the Provanches' property now comprising the Tiller lot and the cabin lot.

First, substantial evidence in the record supports the trial court's finding that before 1976 (when the then-owners of the Tiller lot and the cabin lot acquired the abandoned right-of-way between their parcels and Northshore Road), the property comprising the Tiller lot and the cabin lot was landlocked by the plat to the west, the railroad to the north, a stream and ravine to the east, and Lake Whatcom to the south. Specifically, the trial court found\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-85\">\n   there was necessity for access across Lakeview Street to the [Tiller lot], and to the cabin lot, and that existed because of the fact that, with the cabin lot creation, it was fully landlocked. In fact, the [Tiller] lot now owned by the [Tillers] was also at that point in time probably landlocked as well. Prior to 1976, access to Northshore Road was not available and not likely to be granted due to the railroad which was in active use. There was no access to the east. The stream and its ravine on the east side of the cabin lot prevented it. There was no evidence of access from the east at any time.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   \u00b6 57 The trial court also noted, in unchallenged findings, that the Tiller lot \"may have also been technically landlocked if there was no right to access it via Lakeview Street\" and that although the creation of the cabin lot easement did not itself convey any right to use Lakeview Street, \"without such use the easement is meaningless. It would be an 'easement to nowhere.' \" Furthermore, and significantly, the Provanches could have terminated the street parcel at the western boundary of lot 10 had they intended the street parcel to serve only the plat. But they chose to extend the street parcel, which, again, was reserved for use solely for street purposes, all the way\n   <em>\n    across\n   </em>\n   the northern boundary of lot 10 to its boundary with what is now the Tiller lot. Although the trial court concluded that this choice by the Provanches did not create a presumption that the Provanches intended to create separate and distinct lots from the portion of their remaining property now comprising the Tiller lot and the cabin lot, this choice-together with the fact that that portion of their property was landlocked in 1947-does indicate that the\n   Provanches intended to reserve an access to that portion of their remaining property via the street parcel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   \u00b6 58 The facts of this case are closely analogous to\n   <em>\n    Fossum Orchards v.

However, the pipe itself was in existence at that time, no alternative source of water was reasonably available, and \"[a]lthough prior use is a circumstance contributing to the implication of an easement, if the land cannot be used without the easement without disproportionate expense, an easement may be implied on the basis of necessity alone.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 451-52,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"180\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=892%20P.2d%201095\">\n    892 P.2d 1095\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   \u00b6 60 Here, the street parcel is analogous to the pipe in\n   <em>\n    Fossum Orchards\n   </em>\n   , and Lakeview Street is analogous to water flowing within it. Although Lakeview Street may not yet have been installed within the street parcel at the time of severance, neither was there evidence that the pipe in\n   <em>\n    Fossum Orchards\n   </em>\n   had ever been used. Furthermore, like the pipe in\n   <em>\n    Fossum Orchards\n   </em>\n   , the street parcel was in existence at the time of severance: It had been dedicated as a separate parcel specifically for street purposes, and its location had been fixed on the recorded plat.

Scott\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"254588\" index=\"181\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-app/95/431/\">\n    95 Wash.

In\n   <em>\n    McPhaden\n   </em>\n   , we affirmed the trial court's directed verdict that no implied easement existed because the claimant had failed to establish prior use or necessity.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 439,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"183\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=975%20P.2d%201033\">\n    975 P.2d 1033\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . However, in\n   <em>\n    McPhaden\n   </em>\n   , the road at issue-although recorded at the time of severance-was an easement road, and the claimant's own testimony that a driveway could be installed established that use of the disputed road was not reasonably necessary to access his property.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 433, 438-39,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"184\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=975%20P.2d%201033\">\n    975 P.2d 1033\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   \u00b6 62 Here, unlike in\n   <em>\n    McPhaden\n   </em>\n   , the road at issue is not just an easement road over someone's parcel, but a road installed within a separate and distinct parcel dedicated solely for use as a road. Furthermore, the trial court's unchallenged findings establish that, at the time of severance, use of the easement would have been reasonably necessary to access a physically landlocked portion of the remaining Provanche property east of the plat.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   \u00b6 63 In sum, the Provanches reserved the cabin lot easement only a few years after recording the plat. The Provanches also extended the street parcel-which, again, was dedicated specifically for street purposes-completely\n   <em>\n    across\n   </em>\n   the northern boundary of lot 10. Furthermore, the portion of the Provanches' property just east of the plat was landlocked. These unique circumstances together support a conclusion that the Provanches intended to reserve to themselves an easement for access to the landlocked portion of their remaining property at the time they severed their interest in the plat. We conclude\n   that the elements of an implied easement have been satisfied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   \u00b6 64 In Tiller's cross appeal, Tiller also challenges finding of fact 29. Finding of fact 29 includes a number of observations regarding the present-day necessity of an access to the Tiller lot via Lakeview Street. Tiller challenges only the court's observation that it \"need not decide if there is a requirement of direct access to the house instead of the garage building\" and that \"[m]ost likely, the current driveway would be deemed adequate under the law if the Court were addressing the issue of necessity.\" The trial court then states in finding of fact 30 that because there is no legal basis for an implied easement by necessity, \"any evidence or legal theories regarding the physical realities on the [Tiller] lot ... are essentially irrelevant.\" We agree with this finding inasmuch as it states that necessity must be evaluated at the time of severance. But we disagree that present-day conditions on the Tiller lot are irrelevant. The findings regarding present-day physical realities of the Tiller lot are relevant to the extent that these same realities existed at the time of severance, and they are also relevant in determining the scope of the easement that will be implied. Specifically, although the scope of an implied easement is \"initially defined by the necessity ... existing [at the time of severance], ... similarly to a granted easement of general access, its permitted scope is capable of gradual change to keep pace with reasonable changes in uses of the dominant tenement.\" STOEBUCK &amp; WHITMAN , \u00a7 8.5, at 449. Here, in an unchallenged finding, the trial court observed that Tiller is still\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-94\">\n   limited by topography, by the need to honor the [cabin lot] easement in favor of the cabin lot, by the placement of utilities such as transformer, gas line, and fire hydrant. Therefore, ... the need is a greater one than just one of convenience, as there are significant physical and cost restraints on building a direct driveway from Northshore Road to the Tiller house site.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   This finding confirms that necessity still exists, even though the scope of the implied easement may have changed overtime.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   \u00b6 65 To that end, because the trial court's award of an easement to Tiller takes into account changes in the physical realities of the Tiller lot since 1947, we affirm that award, including those portions of the trial court's judgment specifying the width and location thereof and the restrictions placed by the trial court on use of Lakeview Street by Tiller and the owners of lots 9 and 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   \u00b6 66 We also affirm the trial court's award of $1,340 in costs to Tiller because although Lackey assigned error to this award, Lackey did not provide specific argument.\n   <em>\n    Holland\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"428751\" index=\"185\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-app/90/533/#p538\">\n    90 Wash.
