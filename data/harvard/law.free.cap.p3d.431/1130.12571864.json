In the second motion, he argued, if the lookback is to the date of the conviction, the statute violates constitutional equal protection rights. The district court denied both motions, finding the lookback period was to the date of the first conviction-not the underlying conduct-and that the statute was not unconstitutional.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   [\u00b65] Following those rulings, the parties entered into a conditional plea agreement. Mr. Rhoads agreed to plead guilty to fourth offense felony DWUI, but reserved the right to appeal the district court's rulings on his pre-trial motions. The State agreed to dismiss the charge of driving while under suspension and to limit its sentencing recommendation to three to five years' incarceration. The district court accepted Mr. Rhoads' conditional plea. It sentenced Mr. Rhoads to four to six years of imprisonment, with credit for 203 days of presentence confinement.

The significant dates are those of his first offense, his first conviction, and his fourth, most recent offense. The first offense occurred on August 25, 2006.

Mr. Rhoads asserts that the language \"[o]n a fourth offense resulting in a conviction or subsequent conviction within ten (10) years for a violation of this section\" establishes the lookback period to the first offense and not the first conviction.

We consider that choice to have been intentional. Had the legislature intended the lookback period to be the same for both misdemeanor and felony enhancements, it could have added the \"after a conviction\" language to the fourth offense felony conditions. It did not. Accordingly, we conclude that the legislature deliberately omitted the language and, by doing this, it intended to make a distinction between the lookback periods to be used for misdemeanor second and third offenses and the lookback period for felony fourth offenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   [\u00b615] This interpretation is supported by the legislative history of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wyo.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2031-5-233\">\n    Wyo.

We held that the amended statute was a \"response to our direct language in\n   <em>\n    Seteren\n   </em>\n   \" and that it unambiguously \"provides that the [lookback] period for enhanced DWUI penalties is measured back in time ... from the last\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     offense\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   [and not the conviction].\"\n   <em>\n    Ramirez\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 12-13,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12180782\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/386/348/\">\n    386 P.3d at 350\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis in original).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   [\u00b617] The legislature chose to change the word \"conviction\" to the phrase \"offense resulting in a conviction\" in each enhanced penalty provision - the second, third, and fourth. This language defines the event that triggers the lookback. However, in describing the event we look back to, the legislature did not use the same language in each of the three provisions. As explained in the preceding paragraphs, for the second and third offense, the statute directs the court to lookback from the \"\n   <strong>\n    offense\n   </strong>\n   resulting in a conviction\" to \"a\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     conviction\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   for a violation of this section.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wyo.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2031-5-233\">\n    Wyo.

The statute for the fourth offense omits this direction: \"[o]n a fourth offense resulting in a conviction or subsequent conviction within ten (10) years for a violation of this section ...\" the defendant is guilty of a felony. The State urges us to read the felony enhancement provision as if it contained the language used in the second and third enhancement provisions. We decline to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   [\u00b618] The legislative history, when examined in context with prior cases interpreting the statute, indicates that the legislature intended the focus be on the offense, and not the conviction. The language for the misdemeanor enhancements is clear, we look back to convictions. The felony enhancement language is not the same. We find this is intentional.
