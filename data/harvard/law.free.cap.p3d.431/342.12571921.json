We address the following issue:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-9\">\n   <em>\n    Whether the Water Court erred in denying Little Big Warm Ranch's Motion to Reopen the case and in denying Little Big Warm Ranch's Motion to Substitute Objector.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b62 We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b63 This case involves two water rights from Big Warm Springs Creek and Little\n   Warm Springs Creek: Claim 40M 168788-00 for stockwater, and Claim 40M 168789-00 for irrigation. Cheri and Willie Doll (the Dolls) and LBWR are the current adjacent landowners and parties to\n   this litigation. The water rights at issue have been the subject of litigation dating back to the 1990s.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   On June 9, 2000, the District Court certified the underlying water rights to the Water Court for determination. In 2002, the presiding Water Master issued a Draft Water Master's Report (Draft Report).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b64 In 2005, LBWR predecessors in interest, Lori and Steven Knudsen, sold their land and appurtenant water rights (the Property) to Leslie Greene and John Dudley (Greene/Dudley). On January 23, 2009, an \"Interim Water Management Agreement\" between the Dolls and Greene/Dudley was filed with the Phillips County District Court. On January 19, 2010, Leslie Greene filed objections to the Dolls' water rights in Claim 40M 168788-00\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and Claim 40M 168789-00.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Greene's objections stated: \"The Draft [ ] Report for WC-2000-05 and WC-2000-06 finds this claim to be invalid. The claim should be terminated or withdrawn.\" On June 13, 2013, Greene/Dudley sold the Property to Carthel Finch, Debbie Finch, W.G. Dement, and Jason Dement (Finch/Dement). Finch/Dement did not attempt to substitute as an objector, and Greene remained the objector in the case. On August 19, 2013, the Water Court issued \"Post-Decree Abstracts of Water Right Claim[s].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b65 Finch/Dement and the Dolls negotiated a settlement agreement (Settlement Agreement) resolving the Water Court cases, including Cases 40M-171 and 40M-238. The Settlement Agreement stated, in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   \u2022 The certified Water Court cases, WC-2000-05 and WC-2000-06, would be discontinued and dismissed\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   \u2022 The parties would dismiss or withdraw any objections in Water Court as to the Subject Water Rights\n   \u2022 The Draft Report would not be used by either party in any judicial or administrative proceeding involving any of them as authority, precedent, a decision, or a determination of any issue involving the water rights\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   \u2022 The Dolls' stock and irrigation claims would be decreed as set out in the post-decree abstracts issued by the Water Court on August 19, 2013.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b66 In 2014, Finch/Dement was in the process of selling the Property to LBWR. On October 22, 2014, Finch/Dement sent a copy of the Settlement Agreement to LBWR's counsel. On December 3, 2014, the Dolls signed the Settlement Agreement prior to the Property sale to LBWR. On December 11, 2014, all members of LBWR signed an Acknowledgment of the Settlement Agreement as part of the closing on the Property. On December 15, 2014, Finch/Dement sold the Property to LBWR. Finch/Dement signed the Settlement Agreement shortly afterwards, on December 23, 2014. On June 3, 2015, the Water Court held a scheduling conference on Case 40M-171 and Greene's objections. A LBWR co-manager attended the scheduling conference. Greene did not attend. The Dolls moved for dismissal of Greene's objections. The LBWR co-manager made no objection to the dismissal of Greene's objections. The Water Court entered a default against Greene and ordered Greene to show cause why all of her objections to the claims should not be dismissed. On October 8, 2015, the Water Court dismissed Greene's objections in 40M-238 after Greene again failed to appear. On October 9, 2015, Greene/Dudley filed a Notice of Disclaimer, disclaiming interest in eleven water\n   rights cases where Greene/Dudley had filed objections or notice of intent to appear; seven of those cases involved the Dolls and three directly involved LBWR. On November 14, 2016, LBWR and the Dolls filed a Joint Status Report with the Water Court addressing five water claims, including 40M-238, stating both parties \"agree that they do not wish to modify any of their currently filed water claim rights.\" LBWR and the Dolls also informed the District Court both cases had settled and asked for dismissal. The District Court withdrew its prior orders certifying the underlying water rights and dismissed both cases without prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b67 On November 29, 2017, LBWR filed a Motion to Reopen Proceedings and a Motion to Substitute Objector for Greene's Interest in Cases 40M-171 and 40M-238.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   LBWR argued that the Water Master\n   \"failed to make efforts to notice [LBWR] and afford it an opportunity to substitute itself for Greene.\" On January 22, 2018, the Water Court held oral argument on LBWR's Motion to Reopen Cases 40M-171 and 40M-238. During oral argument, the Water Court noted it was under no obligation to notify LBWR of pre-existing objections. The Water Court further noted that, as a purchaser, LBWR could go to the Water Court record and identify objections to the water rights being purchased or objections filed by a predecessor in interest, and that such information was readily available online. On January 29, 2018, the Water Court denied LBWR's Motion to Reopen and to Assume Objector Greene's Interest.

The Water Court disagreed with LBWR's assertion that it had no obligation to protect itself,\n   and that protection of LBWR's water rights was the responsibility of the Water Court or another party. Further, the Water Court concluded that LBWR's conduct showed it had actual notice of Greene's objections, \"multiple opportunities to protect its interests, and ample time to act on those opportunities.\" These opportunities included: (1) being a prospective purchaser of the Property; (2) when LBWR closed on the Property and all LBWR members signed an Acknowledgement detailing the existence of a water rights agreement between the Dolls and Finch/Dement; (3) when LBWR participated in other Water Court\n   cases involving Greene and Basin 40M; (4) when LBWR's counsel received Greene's Notice of Disclaimer of her objections but waited two years before filing its Motion to Reopen Cases 40M-171 and 40M-238; and (5) when LBWR appeared in proceedings in Case 40M-238 after Greene's objection was dismissed and took no action to have that objection reinstated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b615 LBWR argues the Water Court erred in denying LBWR's Motions to substitute itself as objector in Greene's water rights claims and to reopen the cases involving those claims. LBWR argues its due process rights were violated when LBWR did not receive notice that its property rights were at stake in a legal proceeding and when LBWR was not afforded an opportunity to assume Greene's objections to the Dolls' water rights. LBWR also argues the Water Court erred by making factual findings without allowing the parties to present evidence and refusing to rule on LBWR's evidentiary objections. Finally, LBWR argues it is entitled to be substituted as the real party in interest under M. R. Civ. P. 17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b616 The Dolls counter LBWR cannot obligate the Water Court or the Dolls to notify LBWR of its right to substitute itself for Greene's interest. The Dolls also counter that LBWR had actual and constructive notice of Greene's objections and that LBWR took an active role in other cases involving the Dolls' water rights and Greene's objections. Consequently, LBWR was not deprived of due process, the Water Court did not err, and the Water Court's conclusions of law were correct. We agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b617 LBWR participated in the Water Court Proceedings, knew about the Settlement Agreement, and ratified the Settlement Agreement. LBWR members signed an Acknowledgment of the Settlement Agreement as part of the closing on the Property. Even if the Settlement Agreement was not \"effective\" when LBWR closed on the Property, every member of LBWR represented they had reviewed and approved the Settlement Agreement when they signed the Acknowledgment, and LBWR members ratified the Settlement Agreement with their decision to close on the Property. The Water Court correctly concluded any argument that LBWR lacked ample opportunity to challenge the Dolls' water rights was not credible. Moreover, LBWR clearly had actual and constructive notice of Greene's objections evinced by the contents of the Acknowledgment and Settlement Agreement and LBWR's participation in other Water Court\n   proceedings, including the scheduling conferences.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1-1-217, MCA. LBWR also had constructive notice. As the Water Court also pointed out, objector information was readily available online at LBWR's disposal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1-1-217, MCA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b618 The Water Court also correctly concluded it was under no obligation to notify\n   LBWR that it should file a motion to substitute itself for Greene's objections.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   M. R. Civ. P. 25(c). As a purported objector, LBWR had a responsibility to learn of the status of any objection and to file the appropriate motion for substitution with the Water Court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Yellowstone River\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1995%20WL%2018022725\">\n    1995 WL 18022725\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3, 1995 Mont. Water LEXIS 4, at *8. LBWR concedes that substitution of an objector in a water rights claim does not occur automatically; the burden is on the successor who wishes to become an objector to file a motion for substitution.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Yellowstone River\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1995%20WL%2018022725\">\n    1995 WL 18022725\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3, 1995 Mont. Water LEXIS 4, at *8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b619 LBWR's conduct further belies its claims that the Dolls and the Water Court were obligated to protect LBWR's interests. LBWR attended scheduling conferences and, rather than pursuing Green's objections, LBWR actively ignored or dismissed them. LBWR acted as if the Settlement Agreement were binding upon it and represented to the Water Court and the District Court that it was satisfied with the status of the water claims. LBWR's participation in Water Court proceedings demonstrates an awareness of its obligations and a deliberate decision to discontinue pursuit of the objections. LBWR cannot now substitute itself as an objector for Greene-a party who disclaimed any interest as an objector in October 2015. The Water Court did not err and did not abuse its discretion when it denied LBWR's Motion to Reopen and denied LBWR's request to substitute itself for Greene's objections.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Reilly\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5318990\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/251/155/#p158\">\n    251 Mont. at 158-59\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5318990\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/251/155/#p158\">\n    822 P.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1089 ; M.

The Dolls argue LBWR's appeal was not made in good faith based on the conclusions of the Water Court, finding: (1) LBWR made assertions that do not have credible evidentiary support; (2) LBWR cannot reasonably claim it was unaware of the Settlement Agreement; and (3) LBWR knew or should have known of the Settlement Agreement before closing and certainly knew about it after closing. LBWR counters it appealed the Water Court's Order on several reasonable grounds and has done so in good faith.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b622 M. R.
