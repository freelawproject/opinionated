We affirm in part, vacate in part, and remand for correction of the mittimus.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   I. Background\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b6 2 At approximately 2:00 a.m. on January 15, 2008, the police were dispatched to Friend's apartment because M.B., the daughter of Friend's girlfriend, C.H., was no longer breathing. The police administered CPR on M.B. to no avail and a paramedic ultimately transported her to the hospital. The police subsequently notified M.B.'s biological father, A.B., that his daughter had been admitted to the hospital. The next day, a doctor informed A.B. that his daughter was legally brain dead. A.B. decided to remove her from life support, and she later died.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 3 As part of their investigation, an officer and Detective Thrumston, who later testified at trial, interviewed Friend. Although Friend did not disclose much during the interviews at his apartment, he later revealed in a separate videotaped interview with Detective Thrumston that he had hit M.B. on several occasions. He told her that he had popped M.B. in the back of the head so hard that she hit the bed face forward and sprung back and also hit her head on the carpet which covered a cement floor. He stated that he then picked M.B. up, threw her on the bed, took her clothes off, and told her she had to take a bath. He also said that when she began to vomit and later became unresponsive, he threw water on her to revive her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 4 Further, he stated that a few days before M.B.'s death, he had shoved M.B. into a door, and she hit the back of her head so hard that her feet left the ground. She then vomited her dinner and eventually fell to the floor and became unresponsive. Friend then placed her in the bathtub and splashed water on her face to help her regain consciousness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 5 In addition, Friend told Detective Thrumston that he had held M.B.'s head underwater in the bathtub until bubbles came out and that he had flicked M.B. in the vagina with his finger.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 6 Based on these statements, the People charged Friend with the offenses noted above, and the jury convicted him of all charges. The court then sentenced Friend to life in prison without the possibility of parole for his murder conviction and ordered concurrent sentences on the remaining convictions. Friend now appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   II.\n   <em>\n    Batson\n   </em>\n   Challenge\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 7 Friend contends that the trial court erred in concluding that he had to be of the same race or cognizable group as that of an excused juror to make a challenge under\n   <em>\n    Batson v. Kentucky,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12787\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/476/79/\">\n    476 U.S. 79\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12787\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/476/79/\">\n    106 S.Ct. 1712\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12787\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/476/79/\">\n    90 L.Ed.2d 69\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1986). He also argues that the prosecution did not provide race-neutral grounds for excusing Juror H, and that the court did not address the third prong of the\n   <em>\n    Batson\n   </em>\n   analysis to determine whether Friend successfully rebutted the race-neutral grounds. We agree with Friend that he need not be of the same race or cognizable group to make a\n   <em>\n    Batson\n   </em>\n   challenge, but disagree with his remaining contentions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   A.

The prosecutor asserted that Friend could not make a\n   <em>\n    Batson\n   </em>\n   challenge because he was not African-American. The trial court agreed and concluded that the challenged juror and the defendant had to be of the same race.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 12 We conclude that the trial court improperly held that Friend lacked standing to make a\n   <em>\n    Batson\n   </em>\n   challenge.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11319062\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/499/400/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 13 In the alternative, the court engaged in a\n   <em>\n    Batson\n   </em>\n   analysis, which we now review.

At step three, the court must determine whether the defendant has established purposeful discrimination.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . Purposeful discrimination means that the prosecutor strikes a prospective juror \"because of\" the juror's race.\n   <em>\n    People v.

While engaging in a\n   <em>\n    Batson\n   </em>\n   analysis, the court must consider all relevant evidence, both direct and circumstantial.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b6 16 Further, while the trial court should provide defense counsel with an opportunity to rebut the prosecutor's stated reasons before ruling on a\n   <em>\n    Batson\n   </em>\n   challenge, we do not reverse a trial court's ruling unless such a denial prejudices the defendant.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Robinson,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8188219\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/187/1166/#p1172\">\n    187 P.3d at 1174\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (affirming the trial court's denial of defendant's\n   <em>\n    Batson\n   </em>\n   challenge even though the court did not ask defense counsel if he wanted to offer a rebuttal, because there was no indication in the record that defense counsel requested an opportunity to rebut the prosecutor's stated reasons for striking a prospective juror).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b6 17 Here, the prosecutor moved to excuse Juror H because she was not paying much attention during voir dire; she did not remember a fellow prospective juror even though that juror had recognized her; she had had a bad experience with law enforcement; and she had responded to defense counsel's questions without showing any emotion. The court found that those reasons were race neutral and denied Friend's\n   <em>\n    Batson\n   </em>\n   challenge without giving his counsel the opportunity to rebut the prosecutor's assertions. The record does not indicate that Friend's counsel asked the court for an opportunity to rebut the prosecutor's explanations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b6 18 Therefore, we conclude that the trial court's ruling was proper. With respect to step two, the prosecutor provided several race-neutral reasons for excusing Juror H. As to step three, while the court should have provided Friend's counsel with an opportunity to rebut the prosecutor's stated reasons, as in\n   <em>\n    Robinson,\n   </em>\n   Friend was not prejudiced, given the lack of any objection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b6 19 Contrary to Friend's contention, the court also reached the third step of the\n   <em>\n    Batson\n   </em>\n   analysis. Based on the prosecutor's reasons, the court found that the peremptory challenge was not pretextual. Instead, the court stated that the prosecution's reasons \"all make sense and are legitimate. I can't find any racial bias in those answers that the People have given.\" Because step three involves a question of fact, absent a showing of clear error, we defer to the trial court's finding and conclude that the court's denial of Friend's\n   <em>\n    Batson\n   </em>\n   challenge was proper.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   III. Denial of Challenges for Cause\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b6 20 Friend next contends that the trial court should have granted his challenges for cause to two prospective jurors, Juror C and Juror W, who were later removed by peremptory challenges. According to Friend, these two jurors had expressed hesitance about their abilities to decide the case based on the evidence presented, and, as a result, the court erred in not rehabilitating them.

Friend argues that the experts' opinions were unreliable because they did not provide a medical or scientific basis for this aspect of their testimony.

While the doctors did not use any medical test to conclude that M.B.'s injuries were consistent with nonaccidental trauma, all three applied methodologies are commonly used by doctors, including (1) examining the patient's physical condition and injuries; (2) using a process of eliminating\n   various illnesses and diseases to diagnose a patient; and (3) reviewing the patient's history to determine a possible cause for the patient's injuries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   \u00b6 30 Dr. Lee, a pediatric ophthalmologist, testified that he completed a comprehensive eye exam, and, as part of his examination, obtained M.B.'s medical history. Although Dr. Lee could not explain why M.B.'s multi-layered retinal hemorrhages were, in his opinion, likely the result of nonaccidental trauma, he said that the medical field and literature generally accepted and supported his conclusion. Thus, based on his examination and M.B.'s history, he concluded that the death was nonaccidental. Similarly, Dr. Grabert, a child neurologist, conducted a comprehensive eye and brain stem exam, and relied on M.B.'s medical history to conclude that her death was nonaccidental. In contrast, Dr. Grabb, a pediatric neurosurgeon, observed the results of medical exams, such as CT scans, and used a process of elimination to conclude that M.B.'s injuries were the result of nonaccidental trauma.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   \u00b6 31 We conclude that a process of elimination and the use of a patient's medical history to rule out alternative explanations are reliable scientific methods.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bitler v.

By eliminating the presence of any illness or disease, and finding an absence of any accidental trauma to explain M.B.'s injuries, each expert testified that the injuries were consistent with nonaccidental trauma.

First, it found the testimony was highly probative because it helped the jury determine whether M.B.'s death was caused by accidental or nonaccidental trauma.

Evidence is relevant if it has \"any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it\n   would be without the evidence.\" CRE 401. However, not all relevant evidence is admissible.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   CRE 403.

However, defense counsel objected when the prosecutor asked the detective what she discussed with Bogard. The court sustained that objection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   \u00b6 39 Defense counsel subsequently made a prophylactic objection to preclude the detective from expressing emotions that might inflame the prejudices and passions of the jury. Even though the trial court acknowledged that an overwhelming display of emotion would be inappropriate, it overruled the objection because the detective had not yet displayed any emotion. Further, the court noted that the evidence was relevant to describe M.B.'s death and that its probative value was not substantially outweighed by its prejudicial impact.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   \u00b6 40 After the court's ruling, Detective Thrumston testified, and Friend moved for a mistrial. According to defense counsel, the only reason for Detective Thrumston's testimony was to elicit an emotional response from the jury. Defense counsel noted that when the prosecutor asked Detective Thrumston whether she was present when M.B. died, the detective stopped speaking, choked up, and could not answer the question. Friend contends that, as a result, the prosecutor asked the detective if she needed a moment to compose herself. However, the record indicates that the prosecutor asked two questions-\"And were you present when [M.B.] died? Do you need a moment?\"-to which Detective Thrumston responded, \"Yes.\" The detective then clarified that her \"yes\" answer was in reference to whether she was present when M.B. died, not whether she needed a minute to compose herself.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   \u00b6 41 Subsequently, the court denied the motion for a mistrial because it did not observe any overwhelming display of emotion. While the court acknowledged that the detective had used a tissue to daub her eyes, it did not see any tears or an excessive display of emotion. As a result, the trial court denied the motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   \u00b6 42 We conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting Detective Thrumston's testimony and denying the motion for a mistrial. The trial court found that the testimony was relevant to establish that M.B. had died and the manner of her death.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   \u00b6 43 Moreover, in similar circumstances, Colorado courts have held that displays of emotion do not constitute reversible error.\n   <em>\n    See,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    People v.

We agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   \u00b6 58 We begin our analysis by considering the first type of multiplicity issue: whether a statute provides alternative ways of committing the same crime.

As the\n   <em>\n    Abiodun\n   </em>\n   court noted, it is the legislature's prerogative to treat a course of conduct for various acts related in time, nature, or purpose as one or more than one offense. Accordingly, \"the legislature may very well choose to define a series of acts, related along a continuum of conduct or motivated by a single objective, for example, as a single crime.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   \u00b6 59 Under section 18-6-401(1)(a), an accused may commit child abuse by (1) causing an injury to a child's life or health; (2) permitting a child to be unreasonably placed in a situation that poses a threat of injury to the child's life or health; or (3) engaging in a continued pattern of conduct that results in malnourishment, lack of proper medical care, cruel punishment, mistreatment, or an accumulation of injuries that ultimately results in the death of a child or serious bodily injury to a child.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   \u00b6 60 The parties describe this statute as providing for three methods of committing child abuse.

This is reflected in the jury instructions used in this case. For each count of child abuse causing serious bodily injury or child abuse causing death and their respective pattern of conduct counts, the instructions required the jury to find several of the methods listed above. For instance, an instruction for child abuse causing serious bodily injury required the jury to find the first method of child abuse, causing an injury to a child, or the third method, permitting a child to be unreasonably placed in a situation that posed a threat of injury to the child's life, or the fourth method, permitting a child to be unreasonably placed in a situation that posed a threat of injury to the child's health.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   \u00b6 62 Nevertheless, in\n   <em>\n    Abiodun,\n   </em>\n   the court held that \"[w]here ... a number of acts are joined as a disjunctive series, in a single sentence, without any attempt to differentiate them by name or other organizational device, a legislative intent to permit separate convictions and sentences for each enumerated act is not so readily apparent and must be ascertained, if at all, by other aids to statutory construction.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8953575\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/111/462/\">\n    111 P.3d at 466\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

There, the court held that a series of acts, with reference to the same controlled substance and governed by a common mens rea, that included acts that were not mutually exclusive but rather overlapping, constituted different ways of committing a single offense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   \u00b6 64 Notwithstanding\n   <em>\n    Abiodun\n   </em>\n   and related cases, the People rely on\n   <em>\n    Woellhaf\n   </em>\n   to contend that the disjunctive \"or\" is not dispositive of the unit of prosecution. They argue that it does not preclude the prosecution from charging Friend with multiple offenses for the same crime. However,\n   <em>\n    Woellhaf\n   </em>\n   is distinguishable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   \u00b6 65 In that case, the supreme court was not interpreting a sexual assault statute that joined a number of acts in a disjunctive series in a single sentence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Woellhaf,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9027061\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/105/209/\">\n    105 P.3d at 215\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The General Assembly simply established a list of intimate parts that if touched, satisfy the element of 'any sexual contact.' \"). Thus, the People's reliance on\n   <em>\n    Woellhaf\n   </em>\n   is misplaced.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   \u00b6 66 Even if the use of the disjunctive in a statute is not dispositive, the prosecution did not present evidence of factually distinct offenses to show more than one unit of prosecution.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Abiodun,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8953575\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/111/462/\">\n    111 P.3d at 467-70\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The first count of child abuse causing serious bodily injury, count 4, charged that Friend slammed M.B.'s head into the door on January 13, 2008. The second count for the same offense, count 5, charged that Friend slammed her head onto the concrete floor between January 14 and 15, 2008. The People maintain that those\n   two counts do not merge because the prosecution presented them as factually distinct offenses-separate in time and location.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   \u00b6 68 However, the prosecution also charged Friend with count 6, child abuse causing serious bodily injury-pattern of conduct, which also occurred between January 13 and 15, 2008, when he committed the acts stated above. Because count 6 encompasses all of the dates and events alleged in counts 4 and 5, count 6 subsumes those two counts.

Instead, pattern of child abuse is an alternative way of committing child abuse.\n   <em>\n    Cf\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Simon,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6986121\" index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/266/1099/\">\n    266 P.3d at 1108\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (pattern of sexual abuse is not an alternative way of committing sexual assault on a child, but rather a sentence enhancer).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   \u00b6 70 Therefore, while a defendant may be convicted of both sexual assault on a child and sexual assault on a child-pattern of abuse, a defendant may not be convicted of both child abuse and child abuse-pattern of conduct.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6986121\" index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/266/1099/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6986121\" index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/266/1099/\">\n    at 1109\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (concluding there was no double jeopardy violation because \"the plain language [of sections 18-3-405 and 18-3-405.3, C.R.S.2013 ] establishes that the General Assembly intended to authorize separate convictions for\n   <em>\n    each\n   </em>\n   instance of sexual assault on a child or sexual assault by one in a position of trust, and to authorize enhanced punishment of each such assault that is committed as 'a part of a pattern of sexual abuse' \").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   \u00b6 71 Accordingly, all the child abuse counts must merge into one conviction. To consider which conviction should remain, we look to subsection (7) of the child abuse statute, which sets forth the class of felony for different mens rea, where death or injury results and when no death or injury results. For example, when a person knowingly or recklessly commits child abuse resulting in death to the child, it is a class 2 felony, except in certain circumstances, when it is a class 1 felony.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 18-6-401(7)(a)(I). On the other hand, when no death or injury results, an act of child abuse committed by a person acting knowingly or recklessly is a class 2 misdemeanor, except that in certain circumstances it is a class 5 felony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   \u00b6 72 Here, Friend's convictions for child abuse causing death and child abuse causing death-pattern of conduct are both class 2 felonies. However, because child abuse causing death-pattern of conduct appears to be a more serious offense, we elect to merge all of the child abuse convictions into child abuse causing death-pattern of conduct.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    People v.

The trial court's error satisfies all three prongs of the plain error standard of review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   \u00b6 74 First, the error was obvious. While there is no case on point discussing double jeopardy under the child abuse statute, the cases cited above hold that the disjunctive \"or\" provides for alternative ways of committing a single offense.\n   <em>\n    See,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Abiodun,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8953575\" index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/111/462/\">\n    111 P.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   467 ;\n   <em>\n    Viduya,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10421888\" index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/703/1281/#p1292\">\n    703 P.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1292 ;\n   <em>\n    Holmes,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1940270\" index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/colo/129/180/#p182\">\n    129 Colo. at 182\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1940270\" index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/colo/129/180/#p182\">\n    268 P.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   407 ;\n   <em>\n    Wright,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2737232\" index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/colo/116/306/#p310\">\n    116 Colo. at 310\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2737232\" index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/colo/116/306/#p310\">\n    181 P.2d at 449\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Therefore, the trial court should have permitted the prosecution to charge Friend with only one count of child abuse in or entered only one judgment of conviction on the child abuse charges.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    People v. Pollard,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6976345\" index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/307/1124/\">\n    2013 COA 31\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 41,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6976345\" index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/307/1124/\">\n    307 P.3d 1124\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"In light of the well-settled legal principle upon which this rule is based, [and] the prior references in Colorado case law to the rule, ... we conclude that the rule (and any violation of it) should have been 'obvious' to the trial court, despite the fact that there was no Colorado case law squarely on point.\"). Because of the\n   well-established rule stated above, the error was obvious.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   \u00b6 75 Further, the prohibition against double jeopardy is a substantial right guaranteed by the United States and Colorado Constitutions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Greer,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6986765\" index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/262/920/#p924\">\n    262 P.3d at 925\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, the error prejudiced Friend's substantial right.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   \u00b6 76 Last, the error undermines the reliability of Friend's convictions. The jury convicted him of multiple counts of child abuse because the court erred in not consolidating multiple counts under the child abuse statute into a single count. In other words, but for the prosecution's multiple charges, the jury would presumably have convicted Friend of only one count of child abuse. The error contributed to his convictions and therefore casts doubt on their reliability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   \u00b6 77 Accordingly, the trial court committed plain error when it allowed all of Friend's convictions to stand. Thus, we vacate the convictions for child abuse causing death, child abuse causing serious bodily injury-pattern of conduct, and two counts of child abuse causing serious bodily injury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   2. The Strict Elements Test\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   \u00b6 78 Friend also contends that all of the child abuse charges under section 18-6-401(1)(a) should merge into his conviction for first degree murder of a child under the age of twelve by one in a position of trust under section 18-3-102(1)(f). We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   \u00b6 79 Here, the strict elements test requires us to compare the elements of each crime.\n   <em>\n    Dixon,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=509%20U.S.%20688\">\n    509 U.S. at 696\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=113%20S.%20Ct.%202849\">\n    113 S.Ct. 2849\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   \u00b6 80 The crime of first degree murder-child under the age of twelve, position of trust requires that (1) the defendant; (2) in the state of Colorado, at or about the date and place charged; (3) knowingly; (4) caused the death of a child who had not attained twelve years of age; and (5) the defendant was in a position of trust with respect to the victim. \u00a7 18-3-102(1)(f).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   \u00b6 81 The crime of child abuse causing death-pattern of conduct requires that (1) the defendant; (2) in the state of Colorado, at or about the date and place charged; (3) knowingly or recklessly; (4) caused an injury to a child; or (5) permitted a child to be unreasonably placed in a situation that posed a threat of injury to the child's life or health; or (6) engaged in a continued pattern of conduct that resulted in malnourishment, lack of proper medical care, cruel punishment, mistreatment, or an accumulation of injuries that ultimately resulted in the death of the child. \u00a7 18-6-401(1)(a), (7)(a)(I).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   \u00b6 82 Each offense contains an element not included in the other. The offense of child abuse causing death-pattern of conduct requires a pattern of conduct, which is not an element of first degree murder. Additionally, unlike child abuse causing death-pattern of conduct, first degree murder of a child under the age of twelve-position of trust requires that a crime be committed against a child under the age of twelve by a defendant who was in a position of trust with respect to the victim. Accordingly, because each offense requires proof of a fact the other does not, the child abuse offense is not a lesser included offense of first degree murder.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Leske,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11829776\" index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/957/1030/\">\n    957 P.2d at 1039\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   \u00b6 83 Therefore, we conclude that the mittimus should be amended to reflect the following convictions: (1) one count of first degree murder of a child under the age of twelve-position of trust; and (2) one count of child abuse causing death-pattern of conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   VII.
