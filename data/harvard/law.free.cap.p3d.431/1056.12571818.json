Phillips contends that the trial court (1) violated his right to an impartial jury by failing to sua sponte excuse a juror, (2) abused its discretion under ER 801(d)(1)(i) when it admitted a victim statement as evidence, and (3) erred in entering a no-contact order between Phillips, the victim (Phillips's wife), and his stepdaughter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b6 2 In a supplemental assignment of error, Phillips seeks remand to the trial court to strike the imposition of a $100 fee for collection of DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) pursuant to our Supreme Court's recent decision in\n   <em>\n    State v. Ramirez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12570181\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/426/714/\">\n    191 Wash.2d 732\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12570181\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/426/714/\">\n    426 P.3d 714\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2018). The State concedes that remand to strike the DNA collection fee is appropriate. We accept the State's concession. We otherwise affirm Phillips's conviction and sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 3 On July 1, 2016, Phillips came home late after his wife Sara Phillips was in bed asleep with their infant daughter. After Sara told Phillips to leave her alone, an argument ensued that then became physical. Sara's daughter, Joe'll Talbert, and Sara and Phillips's infant daughter were in the house. At some point, Sara gave the phone to Talbert, telling her to call the police if the fight continues or if Phillips hits Sara. Talbert called 911 and reported that Phillips was hitting Sara. When Phillips saw that Talbert was calling the police, he knocked the phone from her hands.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 4 King County Sheriff's deputies responded to the 911 call and found the house in chaos and Sara in the living room crying. Sheriff Deputy Daniel Spiewak interviewed Sara and asked her to describe the altercation and prepared a written victim statement based on what Sara described. In her statement, Sara told Spiewak that Phillips tried to\n   take her baby from her, punched her in the chin, choked her until she felt she would pass out, kicked her, and then tried to throw her down the stairs. Sara signed the victim statement \"under penalty of perjury.\" Sara also told the responding paramedic that Phillips choked her, and that she had neck pain.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 5 Phillips was arrested and booked into jail on July 1, 2016. From jail, Phillips repeatedly called Sara demanding that she get him out and expressing his anger at the police having been called. During these calls Sara made several references to Phillips choking her, at one point stating that he was in jail because he \"sat there and fuckin' choked the fuck outta me.\" The State charged Phillips with assault in the second degree, domestic violence. The State alleged two aggravators. First, that the assault occurred within sight or sound of the victim's or the offender's minor child under the authority of RCW 9.94A.535(3)(h)(ii), and second, that the assault was part of an ongoing pattern of psychological, physical, or sexual abuse under the authority of RCW 9.94A.535(3)(h)(i). The State also charged Phillips with tampering with a witness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 6 A jury found Phillips guilty of second degree assault and found the State proved both aggravating circumstances. The jury was unable to reach a verdict on the tampering charge, and it was dismissed. Phillips had an offender score above nine due to multiple previous domestic violence offenses. Based on Phillips's high offender score, and the jury's findings of two aggravating circumstances, the trial court imposed the statutory maximum sentence of 120 months. The court also imposed a no-contact order with respect to both Sara and Talbert for the duration of his sentence of 120 months.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 7 Phillips appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 8 Phillips first contends that the trial court violated his Sixth and Fourteenth Amendment right to an impartial jury when it failed to, sua sponte, strike juror 10 for bias. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 9 During voir dire, the trial court asked if any of the jurors had personal experience with domestic violence. Juror 10 was among the venire members who raised their hand. When asked to elaborate, he explained that his sister and his wife's sister-in-law were both involved in abusive relationships with intimate partners. The State then asked,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-21\">\n   The question for you, as a juror, is whether you cannot ignore your past experiences but remain open-minded and hold the State-that is, hold me to my burden of proof, that I have to prove this case to you beyond a reasonable doubt. Can you [h]old me to that burden and keep an open mind until you've heard from all of the witnesses?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 10 Juror 10 responded that the issue \"weighed\" on him heavily, and stated, \"I consider myself to be fair and objective by nature, but this is a deeply emotional issue and I don't know.\" The State responded, \"Why don't you think about this as we're kind of talking with everyone, and you'll let us know if you're feeling like this is not the right case for you. Does that work?\" Juror 10 then elaborated, \"What's unknown for me is what will come up in the course of the story and how will that affect me.\" The trial court asked if juror 10 had another issue that he wanted to talk about privately, and stated they would discuss those issues later.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 11 The State and the defense questioned several other jurors about their ability to hold the State to its burden. In the process, seven jurors were dismissed for cause because they expressed an inability to be fair. When juror 10 was given the opportunity to speak privately in the courtroom, he revealed an experience in college after an intermural basketball game when an African American player on the opposing team assaulted him. Juror 10 explained, \"nothing came of it, but it left an emotional imprint.\" He further elaborated,\n  </p>\n  <p type=\"majority\">\n   <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n    And this is an emotional truth. I don't live this way; I don't believe this; but I'm also aware that feelings happen in reality that black men are more prone to violence.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n    It was also notable that afterwards when, you know, the gym supervisor was\n    called and there was just a huddle on the spot, and then, of course there was denial and, you know, dismissiveness of it.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n    And that's another narrative; that those who are violent try to get out of it; so those are two personal emotions imprints that are there, as well.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-27\">\n    Phillips is an African American male.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-28\">\n    \u00b6 12 Juror 10 expounded further on what he called \"emotional truths\" relating to his family members dealing with domestic violence, his concern that \"domestic violence is underreported and underrecognized\" in society, and his belief that \"domestic violence that isn't prosecuted or isn't punished leads to worse tragedy and grief.\" Finally, juror 10 stated,\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n    On the other hand, I trained as a scientist and I hold it as a personal principle to be fair and objective, and I do believe that I could hear and see what happens in this trial fairly and objectively. What I don't know is what the life of those emotional truths will have when push comes to shove, so I feel I owe it to the alleged and to this Court for you all to know that.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-30\">\n    \u00b6 13 In response, the trial court informed juror 10 that the attorneys had some follow-up questions. The State relayed that nobody is suggesting any of the jurors would believe \"domestic violence is fine,\" the question is whether he is \"going to hold the State to its burden.\" The State further offered, \"if at some point you feel like, 'Look, this just isn't something that I think I can hold the State to its burden and not be fair,' just let us know.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-31\">\n    \u00b6 14 Defense counsel then asked about juror 10's statements regarding his \"emotional pull to think that maybe African-American men are more likely to be violent or more likely to try to get out of it if they are ...\" Juror 10 clarified that it was \"those who perpetrate violence\" that are more likely to try to get out of it. Defense counsel asked,\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n    Q. Do you think that in this case where we have a[n] African-American man who is being charged with a crime of violence, that that feeling is something that's going to tip the scale, even if it's just a grain of sand; that that kind of underpinning that it sounds like this comes back from your college years, so we're talking about years of battling with that. Is that something that you think might tip the scale?\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n    A. I don't think so.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-34\">\n    Defense counsel then asked if, like another juror, juror 10 believed being aware of his history made it easier to consciously deal with any bias or prejudice. Juror 10 agreed.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-35\">\n    \u00b6 15 Defense counsel moved on to ask a few follow-up questions about his history with domestic violence. Defense counsel asked if juror 10 believed he \"could look at this case in isolation\" and not as a societal problem. Juror 10 explained that it is \"very difficult for the evidence and the truth of domestic violence to be revealed.\" However, he also stated, \"I understand and ascribe to the principal that it must be the merits of this situation and the evidence and the stories that are presented here that need to establish what the reality is in this particular case.\" Defense counsel also asked if juror 10 would want a juror like him deciding his case. Juror 10 said yes because of his \"ability and intent to be objective and fair,\" but that his history is a consideration. Finally, defense counsel asked,\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n    Q. Are you comfortable taking an oath and saying that, \"I'm here and I'm going to abide by the law, and I'm going to look at this case in the way that the judge instructs me and I'm going to go look at the evidence in this case,\" and swearing to that up front and holding yourself to it at the end?\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n    A. Absolutely.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n    Q. Okay.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n    A. If it's in your judgment that I'm worthy and appropriate, I will absolutely do my best.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-40\">\n    \u00b6 16 Neither party asked for juror 10 to be excused for cause. Following the remainder of individual voir dire, the State accepted the panel without exercising any peremptory challenges. Phillips used all but one peremptory challenge to strike several jurors. With one peremptory challenge left, Phillips accepted the panel. Juror 10 was seated.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-41\">\n    B.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-42\">\n    \u00b6 17 The Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution, and article I, section 22, of the Washington Constitution, guarantee a criminal defendant the right to trial by an impartial jury.\n    <em>\n     State v.

While juror 10 admitted domestic violence was an emotional issue, he stated that he did not know how the facts would affect him. Similarly, while he said he did not believe it, he was aware of feelings that African American men are more prone to violence. Juror 10 explained, further, that as a scientist he was trained and held it as a personal principal to be fair and objective and that he believed he \"could hear and see what happens in this trial fairly and objectively.\" Moreover, both the State and Phillips's counsel pressed juror 10 about his ability to be fair, and received responses from him clarifying that he felt he could be fair and consider the case on the merits. He agreed \"absolutely\" that he could look at the case as instructed and based on the evidence in the case. The trial court did not err in failing to sua sponte excuse juror 10.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-63\">\n    \u00b6 30 Second, this case is also readily distinguishable from\n    <em>\n     Irby\n    </em>\n    because in\n    <em>\n     Irby\n    </em>\n    the defendant both waived his right to counsel and his right to be present at trial.

Consequently, where the defendant is represented by competent counsel acting within the confines of\n    <em>\n     Strickland\n    </em>\n    , the trial court should weigh whether counsel's failure to object may be a legitimate trial strategy before sua sponte interceding.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-66\">\n    \u00b6 32 Here, the record is clear that defense counsel was alert to the possibility of biased jurors. Defense counsel actively questioned juror 10, including questioning whether, despite juror 10's concerns, the juror would follow the court's instructions and base his decision on the evidence presented. As a result, defense counsel did not challenge juror 10. This suggests that defense counsel observed something during voir dire that led counsel to believe juror 10 could be fair. It is also significant that Phillips used his peremptory challenges to strike several jurors, but had one peremptory challenge remaining when he accepted the jury, including juror 10. Again, this suggests that defense counsel either wanted juror 10 on the jury, or did not want one or both the next potential jurors on the panel.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-67\">\n    \u00b6 33 Based on these factors, we hold that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in failing to sua sponte excuse juror 10 for cause.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-68\">\n    III.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-69\">\n    \u00b6 34 Phillips next contends that the trial court abused its discretion when it admitted Sara's victim statement to the responding deputy that Phillips had choked her.

She also testified that she did not remember the deputy telling her that she was signing the statement under penalty of perjury before she signed it. Deputy Spiewak testified that after he finished preparing the victim statement he read it back to Sara and told her it was under penalty of perjury, then let Sara read it herself, after which Sara signed the statement.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-81\">\n    \u00b6 43 Following Deputy Spiewak's testimony, the trial court admitted the victim statement as evidence.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-82\">\n    C.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-83\">\n    \u00b6 44 Phillips argues that Sara's testimony about not remembering whether she was choked, kicked, or nearly thrown down the stairs was not inconsistent with her previous statement made to police as required under ER 801 (d)(1)(i). We conclude that Sara's statements were inconsistent.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-84\">\n    \u00b6 45 First, as the trial court noted, there were several clearly inconsistent statements made during Sara's testimony. Specifically, Sara denied that Phillips punched her in the chin or pushed her to the ground.
