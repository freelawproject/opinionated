The time for trial period can be extended to 90 days if, prior to the expiration of the 60-day limit, the defendant is released from custody.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b6 2 John Maling's case was placed on the superior court docket after the prosecutor noticed Mr. Maling's 60-day in-custody trial deadline was within hours of expiring. Upon appearing before the court, the prosecutor made an oral motion for release. The trial court granted the motion and Mr. Maling's speedy trial deadline was extended by an additional 30 days.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 3 On appeal to this court, Mr. Maling argues the trial court's release order was invalid because it was not preceded by a written motion filed at least five days before the court hearing. We are unpersuaded. Trial courts hold the responsibility for ensuring compliance with speedy trial rules. The ability to meet this obligation is not hindered by the technical requirements for motion practice applicable to litigants. The judgment of conviction is therefore affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 4 On December 3, 2015, the State of Washington charged John Maling with three counts of possession of a controlled substance with intent to deliver. Mr. Maling failed to appear for an August 29, 2016, pretrial hearing, and the court issued a bench warrant for Mr. Maling's arrest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 5 On September 1, 2016, Mr. Maling appeared in court for arraignment. The trial court imposed $100,000 bail and scheduled the next hearing for October 10. Consistent with CrR 3.3(c)(2)(ii), the trial court noted that, because of Mr. Maling's failure to appear on August 29, the 60-day speedy trial period recommenced on September 1. As a result, Mr. Maling's 60-day statutory speedy trial period would expire on October 31.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 6 Mr. Maling never posted bail. The October 10 hearing did not occur due to an apparent oversight.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 7 On October 31, 2016, an unidentified third party alerted the prosecution that Mr. Maling remained in custody. The prosecution then added Mr. Maling's case to the court's afternoon docket for a hearing. Mr. Maling's counsel happened to be present at the courthouse on the afternoon of October 31 on another matter and appeared in court with Mr. Maling for the hearing, which commenced at approximately 3:30 p.m. During the hearing, the State advised the court the\n   case \"[was] a mess.\" Report of Proceedings (Oct. 31, 2016) at 9. The State requested the court either continue the trial schedule or alternatively, release Mr. Maling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 8 Defense counsel objected to the court granting a continuance and argued the speedy trial period had expired.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The defense also made an oral motion for dismissal. The State asserted the 60-day deadline for trial would not expire for another hour and 47 minutes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 9 After hearing from the parties, the trial court ordered Mr. Maling's release from custody on his own recognizance. The court preserved Mr. Maling's right to later argue infringement of his speedy trial rights since Mr. Maling received only one hour's verbal notice of the October 31 hearing. The trial court recalculated his time for trial as being 90 days, rather than 60, from the September 1 arraignment. Jail authorities later released Mr. Maling on October 31.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 10 Mr. Maling and the State later agreed to continue the trial beyond 90 days in part to allow for settlement negotiations, with Mr. Maling presumably reserving the right to object to violation of the 60-day incarceration speedy trial rule. On March 20, 2017, Mr. Maling filed a motion to dismiss for violation of his right to a speedy trial. The court denied the motion. Mr. Maling waived his right to a jury trial, and the court convicted Mr. Maling as charged.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   LAW AND ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 11 Washington's speedy trial rule generally requires that a defendant held in custody be brought to trial within 60 days of arraignment. CrR 3.3(b)(1) ;\n   <em>\n    State v. Chavez-Romero\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4032869\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-app/170/568/#p578\">\n    170 Wash.

If the defendant is released from jail prior to expiration of the 60-day limit, the time for trial is extended to 90 days. CrR 3.3(b)(3). The State can move for a defendant's release from custody in order to extend the speedy trial deadline and avoid dismissal.\n   <em>\n    Chavez-Romero\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4032869\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-app/170/568/#p578\">\n    170 Wash.

Should such motion be submitted, the defendant cannot request continued incarceration in order to force expiration of the speedy trial period.\n   <em>\n    State v.

The rules referenced by Mr. Maling provide that requests for court orders must be made by written motion, unless presented during a hearing or trial. CrR 8.2 ; CR 7(b)(1). In addition, written motions must be served at least five days before the hearing at which they are to be decided. CrR 8.1 ; CR 6(d).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 13 We disagree with Mr. Maling's technical objection to the trial court's disposition. The ultimate responsibility for enforcing Mr. Maling's speedy trial time fell on the court, not the prosecution. CrR 3.3(a)(1). Once the State's prosecutor learned Mr. Maling had not posted bail, he had a duty as a judicial officer to alert the court of the potential for a speedy trial violation so the court could take timely corrective action.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

Given the prosecutor only discovered Mr. Maling's continued incarceration on the 60th day of the in-custody speedy trial period, it was appropriate for the State to alert the trial court of a potential speedy trial problem by immediately placing Mr. Maling's case on the docket.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 14 Once Mr. Maling was in court, the judge had discretion to consider oral motions, including a request for release so as to avoid a speedy trial violation.

The decision held that the 2018 amendments\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   to Washington's legal financial obligation scheme apply prospectively to cases on direct review at the time of enactment. Of interest to Mr. Maling, the 2018 amendments prohibit imposition of a $200 criminal filing fee on defendants who are indigent at the time of sentencing as defined by RCW 10.101.010(3)(a)-(c). RCW 36.18.020(2)(h). Also prohibited is the assessment of a DNA database fee if the State has previously collected the defendant's DNA as a result of a prior conviction.

The trial court noted that, because of Maling's failure to appear on August 29, the sixty-day speedy trial period recommenced on September 1.

Maling's counsel by happenstance was present at the courthouse on the afternoon of October 31 and received notice, at 2:30 p.m., from the prosecution that his client would appear for a hearing an hour later. The record does not reflect the filing of any written notice for hearing or a written motion. During the 3:30 Halloween hearing, the State advised the court that the case \"[was] a mess\" and requested a continuance of the trial schedule or, in the alternative, to release Maling.

He focuses his argument instead on the State's purported failure to properly schedule the sudden October 31 hearing. He contends that the State failed to comply with the requirements of CrR 8.2 and CR 7(b) when abruptly scheduling the October 31 hearing. I agree.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-48\">\n    \u00b6 31 CrR 8.2 addresses notice for motions in criminal prosecutions. The rule tersely reads:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n    Rules 3.5 and 3.6 and CR 7(b) shall govern motions in criminal cases.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-50\">\n    CrR 3.5 concerns a State motion to admit an incriminating statement uttered by the defendant and CrR 3.6 concerns a defense motion to suppress evidence, so neither rule bears relevance to this appeal. CR 7(b)(1), a civil rule, declares:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n    <em>\n     An application to the court for an order shall be by motion which, unless made during a hearing or trial, shall be made in writing,\n    </em>\n    shall state with particularity the grounds therefor, and shall set forth the relief or order sought. The requirement of writing is fulfilled if the motion is stated in a written notice of the hearing of the motion.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-52\">\n    (Emphasis added.)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-53\">\n    \u00b6 32 John Maling argues the State violated CR 7(b)(1) by failing to afford him written notice of the October 31 application for an order releasing him from custody. In response, the State argues it did not need to provide written notice because it made the application during a hearing that it scheduled for October 31. The State emphasizes the portion of CR 7(b)(1) that allows an unwritten motion if made during a hearing.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-54\">\n    \u00b6 33 A literal reading of CR 7(b)(1) supports the State's position. The State orally asked the trial court for release during an October 31 hearing. Nevertheless, the State's argument leads to extreme and prejudicial results. The State could withhold a written motion on any number of and all varieties of applications to the court, other than a CrR 3.5 motion to introduce a confession at trial, give oral notice to the defense attorney minutes before a hearing, and then ask for such relief. Such an application could include critical pretrial motions such as a motion for a trial continuance, motion to remove a judge, motion to exclude a witness, or a motion in limine. The defense would be prejudiced by such a tactic since it would not have time to prepare a response. The reading of CR 7(b)(1) by the State would negate the rule's requirement of a written motion since the State could simply orally schedule and argue all motions at a time convenient for the State.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-55\">\n    \u00b6 34 The State's argument fails to observe that it had no hearing scheduled for the prosecution against John Maling for the afternoon of October 31 until it scheduled the emergency hearing to release John Maling. For CR 7(b)(1) to be fair to both parties and not lead to extreme results, the court must read the rule to limit the presentation of oral motions at hearings when a party already properly scheduled a hearing on another written application or during trial.
