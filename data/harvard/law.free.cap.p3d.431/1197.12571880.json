Rather, the law of the state in which an employee's workers' compensation is paid determines the assignment rights of the employer and employee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 2 Stephanie Jackson, a South Carolina resident, was employed as a semi-truck driver for Drivers Management, LLC (\"DM\"), a Nebraska company. DM contracted with Eagle KMC, LLC (\"Eagle\"), an Arizona company, to provide training for Jackson in Arizona. In February 2014, Jackson was a passenger in a semi-truck driven by Rachael Hender, an Eagle employee. Jackson was injured when Hender rolled the semi-truck while driving in Arizona. She subsequently applied for and received workers' compensation in Nebraska. DM, which is self-insured for workers' compensation, paid Jackson's benefits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 3 In February 2016, a few days before Arizona's two-year statute of limitations expired,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   A.R.S. \u00a7 12-542(1), Jackson filed this personal injury action against Eagle, Hender, and Werner Enterprises (the registered owner of the semi-truck) (collectively \"Eagle\"), alleging several claims, including strict liability, negligence, and \"statutory violations.\" In accordance with Nebraska law, because DM had a subrogation claim against any third-party recovery, Jackson named DM as a defendant.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Neb.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2048-118\">\n    Neb.

Section 23-1023(B) provides, among other things, that if a person entitled to compensation under Arizona's workers' compensation laws does not file an action against a third person who caused the injury within one year of the action accruing, the action is deemed to be assigned to the employer or the workers' compensation insurer. The superior court granted summary judgment in favor of Eagle, reasoning that \u00a7 23-1023(B) applied here, and thus Jackson had no legal interest in the action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 5 The court of appeals reversed.\n   <em>\n    Jackson v.

If Arizona law applies, then Jackson has no legal interest in the action. Specifically, pursuant to \u00a7 23-1023(B), because\n   Jackson did not file a claim against Eagle within one year after the accident, her claim was automatically assigned to DM. In contrast, if Nebraska law applies, then Jackson retains her legal interest, because Nebraska has no automatic assignment provision.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Neb.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2048-118\">\n    Neb.

This rule comports with the Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws \u00a7 185 (Am.

According to Eagle, unless a third-party claim is \"exempt\" under \u00a7 23-904(C), Arizona workers' compensation law applies. Eagle asserts that because Jackson does not qualify for an exemption pursuant to \u00a7 23-904(C), she is subject to the automatic assignment provision in \u00a7 23-1023(B) and therefore has no legal interest in this action. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b6 11 We need not determine whether Jackson's claim is exempt under \u00a7 23-904(C) because the statute is not relevant to the choice of law issue in this case. Section 23-904(C), by its terms, does not apply to the assignment rights of employees and employers in the context of a third-party claim. Rather, \u00a7 23-904(C) addresses when an out-of-state employee who is injured in Arizona is \"exempt from\" (i.e., not entitled to receive) workers' compensation benefits in Arizona. Indeed, apart from subsection (C), the remainder of \u00a7 23-904 focuses on the payment of workers' compensation benefits.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 23-904(A), (B) (stating that Arizona employees injured in this state or another state are \"entitled to\" Arizona workers' compensation benefits); \u00a7 23-904(G) (discussing the set-offs and credits applied to workers' compensation paid to an employee who receives benefits in both Arizona and another state);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Stambaugh v. Killian\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12310521\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/242/508/\">\n    242 Ariz. 508\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 509 \u00b6 7,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12310521\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/242/508/\">\n    398 P.3d 574\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 575 (2017) (stating we construe a subsection of a statute in the context of the entire statute).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b6 12 To the extent there is any ambiguity, \u00a7 23-904(C) 's legislative history supports our construction. Nothing in that history indicates that the statute was intended to affect third-party claims. Rather, the legislative history shows that the statute's purpose was to address the payment of workers' compensation benefits for workers who may be eligible to receive benefits in Arizona and another state.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ariz. State Senate Fact Sheet for S.B. 1148, 51st Leg., 1st Reg. Sess. (Jan. 30, 2013) (stating that the law was meant to replace the existing \"statute that dictates ... the\n   <em>\n    right to compensation\n   </em>\n   of an out-of-state employee injured in Arizona.\") (emphasis added);\n   <em>\n    see also Hearing on S.B. 1148 Before the S. Comm. on Commerce, Energy and Military\n   </em>\n   , 51st Leg., 1st Reg. Sess. (Jan. 30, 2013) (statement of Sen. John McComish, Member, S. Comm. on Commerce, Energy &amp;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Military), http://azleg.granicus.com/MediaPlayer.php?clip_id=11508&amp;autostart=0&amp;meta_id=226129 (explaining, as the bill's sponsor, that the statute is intended to require employees to file for benefits in their state of employment to protect Arizona employers from having to pay benefits under the more generous workers' compensation laws of another state).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b6 13 In short, \u00a7 23-904(C) does not abrogate the rule set forth in\n   <em>\n    Quiles\n   </em>\n   . We therefore approve\n   <em>\n    Quiles\n   </em>\n   and hold that because Jackson received workers' compensation benefits in Nebraska, that state's law regarding assignment applies to her claims against Eagle in this action. Thus, because Nebraska does not have an automatic assignment provision, Jackson has a legal interest in those claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b6 14 For the foregoing reasons, we vacate the court of appeals' opinion, reverse the superior court's grant of summary judgment in favor of Eagle, and remand the case to the superior court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
