Stat. Ann. \u00a7 35-7-1031\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(ii) (LexisNexis 2013). The district court released him on bond after his initial appearance. On two separate occasions between the initial appearance and sentencing, the State sought to revoke Mr. Cooper's bond. The first petition to revoke bond, based on failure to check in and provide a urine analysis, was pending at the time of the change of plea hearing. At that hearing, Mr. Cooper pled \"no contest\" to one count of felony possession of methamphetamine. The district court accepted Mr. Cooper's plea and continued his bond. The second petition to revoke Mr. Cooper's bond was based on Mr. Cooper's alleged use of methamphetamine and marijuana in violation of the terms of his bond. The district court revoked the bond. On February 20, 2015, the district court sentenced Mr. Cooper to five to seven years' incarceration. Finding Mr. Cooper a qualified offender under Wyoming's Addicted Offender Accountability Act (AOAA or \"the Act\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wyo.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%207-13-1301\">\n    Wyo. Stat. Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 7-13-1301\n   </extracted-citation>\n   et seq. (LexisNexis 2013), the court suspended his sentence in favor of a split sentence of 180 days in jail, subject to early release upon acceptance into an inpatient treatment facility, followed by a period of five years of probation. It appears that Mr. Cooper was released from jail early and successfully completed inpatient treatment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   [\u00b6 4] In October of 2016, the State sought to revoke Mr. Cooper's probation alleging failure to complete aftercare treatment, failure to keep two office visits with his probation officer, and failure to comply with monetary obligations in the sentence and probation order. Mr. Cooper admitted that he failed to complete aftercare treatment and to missing the office visits. The State withdrew the remaining allegation. The district court revoked Mr. Cooper's probation and reinstated his original sentence. The court again suspended the sentence in favor of another five-year term of probation. The court again found Mr. Cooper was a qualified offender under the AOAA and again\n   required him to complete inpatient treatment as a condition of probation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   [\u00b6 5] In February of 2017, the State filed a second petition to revoke Mr. Cooper's probation. The petition alleged that Mr. Cooper had violated the terms of probation by failing to provide proof that he applied for inpatient treatment, testing positive for methamphetamine and marijuana, failing to check in with his probation officer, and failing to provide a valid phone number to his probation officer. After a hearing, the district court found that Mr. Cooper had willfully violated his probation and it revoked Mr. Cooper's probation. The court imposed the underlying sentence of five to seven years' incarceration, explaining \"[n]otwithstanding [its earlier] finding that [Mr. Cooper] is a Qualified Offender, the interests of justice require a period of incarceration based upon the circumstances regarding this offender and facts of this case.\" Mr. Cooper is incarcerated at the Wyoming Honor Farm. While incarcerated, Mr. Cooper has successfully completed treatment programs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   [\u00b6 6] Mr. Cooper moved for a Rule 35 reduction in sentence within one year of its imposition. W.R.Cr.P. 35(b). The district court denied Mr. Cooper's Rule 35 motion stating that the \"court has considered the motion and other submittals in the court file, including the Presentence Investigation Report, and the court can find no good reason to reduce or modify the sentence previously imposed.\" Mr. Cooper filed a timely notice of appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     STANDARD OF REVIEW\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   [\u00b6 7] \"[T]he interpretation and application of the AOAA ... is a question of law that we review\n   <em>\n    de novo.\n   </em>\n   \"\n   <em>\n    Janpol v.

Mr. Cooper argues that once a defendant is found to be a qualified offender under the AOAA, and the defendant completes treatment, the Act requires probation. He also states that his rights to due process and equal protection were violated when the district court denied the motion to reduce his sentence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   We will first address the question of whether the AOAA requires release of a qualified offender who completes treatment while incarcerated.

The sentence or probation order shall set forth the terms of a treatment program based upon the substance abuse assessment and any other terms and conditions as the court may deem appropriate under the circumstances, and require the offender to satisfactorily complete the treatment program.

Recognizing that \"the word 'may' when used in a statute is permissive,\" we held that the statute does not limit trial court discretion in making sentencing decisions.
