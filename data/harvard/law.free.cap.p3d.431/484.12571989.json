Lebanon Chiropractic Clinic, an Illinois medical provider, brought a nationwide consumer protection class action against Liberty Mutual Insurance in Illinois. This suit was resolved in a settlement that was approved by an Illinois trial court and entered as a judgment. Chan Healthcare Group, a Washington medical provider, received reasonable notice of the suit and neither opted out of the class nor objected to the entry of judgment. Chan now seeks to collaterally challenge the Illinois judgment in our courts, arguing the interests of the Washington class members were not adequately represented in the Illinois action. Chan fails to show its due process rights were violated. Thus, the full faith and credit clause requires us to enforce our sister court's judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   FACTS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 2 Chan sued Liberty for failing to pay its reasonable bills as required by our casualty insurance statutes, RCW 48.22.095, .005(7), and engaging in an unfair practice under Washington's Consumer Protection Act, chapter 19.86 RCW. Liberty moved for summary judgment based on an Illinois trial court's previous approval of a nationwide class action settlement of all claims against Liberty and the other defendants arising from the same bad acts Chan now alleges here.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lebanon Chiropractic Clinic Prof'l Corp. v. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20IL%20App%20%285th%29%20150111-U\">\n    2016 IL App (5th) 150111-U\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%20546909\">\n    2016 WL 546909\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (unpublished). Chan argued that its claims were not released by the Illinois settlement of Lebanon's nationwide class action on the theory that the interests of Washington class members were not adequately represented in the Illinois action and thus the settlement was unenforceable against them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 3 The Illinois court dismissed all objections to the settlement. The very issue of adequate class representation for Washington class members was raised in the Illinois class action by Dr. David Kerbs, a Washington chiropractor.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Dr. Kerbs argued that the class representative, Lebanon, could not adequately represent the Washington class in light of Washington's more protective consumer protection laws. Following a fairness hearing, the Illinois trial court rejected Dr. Kerbs' inadequacy of representation argument and approved the nationwide settlement. The Illinois trial court found that Lebanon \"will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the Settlement Class.\" Clerk's Papers (CP) at 4154. Dr. Kerbs unsuccessfully appealed and did not seek review by the Illinois Supreme Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 4 In Chan's new case, the King County Superior Court ruled that the Illinois trial court did not address adequate representation with any specificity-it made only a \"passing rubber stamp reference\" in the final order approving settlement.

The superior court also contrasted Illinois and Washington law and stated that \"it looks to be more difficult to make out a [consumer protection] claim in Illinois than in Washington.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 198. Finally, the superior court disagreed with the lack of appointment of anybody to represent a Washington subclass on its CPA claims.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 200.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 5 The Court of Appeals commissioner granted Liberty's motion for interlocutory discretionary review\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   and the Court of Appeals reversed, concluding the Illinois settlement was owed full faith and credit. The Court of Appeals adopted a three-part test: \"(1) whether the specific due process objection was before the sister state court, (2) whether the parties presented briefing on the objection, and (3) whether the sister state court ruled on the objection.\"\n   <em>\n    Chan Healthcare Grp.

We granted review and affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   1. INTERLOCUTORY REVIEW\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 7 Chan argues the Court of Appeals \"lacked jurisdiction\" to consider the King County Superior Court's ruling and did not rely on RAP 2.3. Pet. for Review at 9. We disagree. Read as a whole, the commissioner's ruling granting interlocutory discretionary review suggests that the King County Superior Court committed probable error by declining to give full faith and credit to the Illinois trial court's ruling. The scope of review under the full faith and credit clause is a threshold question and the commissioner sustainably concluded that the King County Superior Court's ruling conflicted with\n   <em>\n    Nobl Park, L.L.C. of Vancouver v. Shell Oil Co.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"499685\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-app/122/838/\">\n    122 Wash.

More importantly, even if the commissioner erred, such error would not have deprived the court of jurisdiction. It would simply be an error subject to modification and review, and Chan did not seek our review of that decision at that time.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Geoffrey Crooks,\n   <em>\n    Discretionary Review of Trial Court Decisions under the Washington Rules of Appellate Procedure,\n   </em>\n   61 WASH L.

FULL FAITH AND CREDIT\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 8 The King County Superior Court determined that Chan's release of claims in the Illinois settlement was not entitled to full faith and credit in Washington courts.

Those who had already manifested injury were focused on \"generous immediate payments,\" while those facing future injury desired \"an ample, inflation-protected fund for the future.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"915571\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/521/591/#p627\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"915571\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/521/591/#p627\">\n    at 626\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"915571\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/521/591/#p627\">\n    117 S.Ct. 2231\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . These differences in injury and sought-after relief necessitated subclasses with separate representatives who possessed the \" 'same interest and suffer[ed] the same injury' \" as those in the same subclass.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"915571\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/521/591/#p627\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"915571\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/521/591/#p627\">\n    at 625-26\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"915571\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/521/591/#p627\">\n    117 S.Ct. 2231\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    E.

This is not the factual scenario before us now. Chan and Lebanon incurred the same injury, a reduction in payments by Liberty, and thus have the same interest in pursuing a claim against Liberty. The only differences between Lebanon and the Washington class members were minor variations in the state laws under which their claims arose. Because Lebanon possessed the same injury and the same interest as the Washington class members,\n   <em>\n    Amchem\n   </em>\n   is not applicable, and subclasses would not have been required.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b6 15 Chan has not convinced us that Washington plaintiffs were not adequately represented in the\n   <em>\n    Lebanon\n   </em>\n   court. Therefore, Chan has failed to overcome the presumption in favor of giving full faith and credit to the determination of the Illinois trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b6 16 While the Illinois trial court's finding of adequacy-after Chan was given notice and the opportunity to object-is likely sufficient to resolve this case, we note there is more here. Here, the same arguments made by Chan were previously made in Illinois by Dr. Kerbs. Dr. Kerbs argued, among other things, \"Lebanon Chiropractic Clinic is an inadequate class representative for Washington providers and has a conflict of interests with Washington providers.\" CP at 4042. The Illinois trial court considered Dr. Kerbs' objections and the evidence relating to it.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 4154 (\"the Proposed Settlement is the result of good-faith, arms-length negotiations by the parties thereto\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 4156 (\"[t]he Court overrules all objections\"). And the trial court's consideration is crystallized by the Illinois Appellate Court, which held that Dr. Kerbs had failed to identify \"outcome-determinative differences in Washington law and Illinois law.\"\n   <em>\n    Lebanon,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%20546909\">\n    2016 WL 546909\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *11, *14.
