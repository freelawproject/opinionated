In 2009, the Respondent moved to Oklahoma and continued to practice law in Texas, having not yet been licensed in Oklahoma.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   During that period she hired a Texas resident Jeffrey Gipson as a paralegal. The Respondent met Gipson while the two were studying for the Texas Bar Exam.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mr. Gipson had failed to pass the exam and had been performing paralegal work.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Respondent's law office was essentially Gipson's home in Texas and she maintained a P.O.

The Evidentiary Panel made Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law concerning the Respondent's professional conduct in the three disciplinary cases. The panel held the Respondent violated Texas Disciplinary Rules of Professional Conduct, Rules 1.01 (b) (1) (competent and diligent representation), 1.03 (a) (communication), 1.14 (b) (safekeeping property), 5.03 (a) (responsibilities regarding nonlawyer assistants), and 5.04 (a) (Professional Independence of a Lawyer).\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   The panel imposed upon the Respondent a fully probated suspension of two years. A probated suspension allows the lawyer to practice during the probation as long as they comply with the terms of the probation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   There were ten terms of probation which included payment of restitution to one of her clients in the amount of $1,566.66 as well as payment of costs to the Texas State Bar in the amount of $1,962.50. The Judgment of Fully Probated Suspension also allowed the Chief Disciplinary Counsel to file a motion to revoke the probation upon information the Respondent violated a term of the judgment. Nothing in the present record indicates such a motion was ever filed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 4 At the time of her probated suspension, the Respondent was licensed to practice law in Oklahoma and the Oklahoma Bar Association instigated a reciprocal disciplinary proceeding pursuant to Rule 7.7 RGDP.

In its Findings of Fact it determined: Veronica Gallegos hired the Respondent in 2010, the Respondent failed to promptly comply with reasonable requests for information, failed to deposit settlement funds in a separate trust account, failed to provide a written statement describing the outcome of the personal injury matter as well as remittances to any medical providers, failed to notify medical providers of the settlement, failed to surrender to Gallegos the paper and property she was entitled upon termination of representation, failed to make reasonable efforts to ensure Gipson's conduct was compatible with the professional obligations of the Respondent, and the Respondent engaged in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation. These actions constituted violations of the following Texas Disciplinary Rules of Professional Conduct: 1.03 (a) 39 (Communication), 1.04 (d) 40 (Fees), 1.14 (a)\n   <footnotemark>\n    41\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Holding Funds in a Separate Account), 1.14 (b)\n   <footnotemark>\n    42\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Notification of Client Upon Receipt of\n   Funds), 1.15 (d)\n   <footnotemark>\n    43\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Duties Upon Termination of Representation), 5.03 (a)\n   <footnotemark>\n    44\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Supervision Over Non-Lawyers), and 8.04 (a) (3)\n   <footnotemark>\n    45\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Dishonesty, Fraud, Deceit or Misrepresentation). The Panel's judgment disbarred the Respondent effective January 26, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 10 On March 13, 2018, this Court received the Complainant's Notice of Judgment of Disbarment with the attached certified copy of the judgment. The notice also informed this Court that the Respondent is currently suspended from practicing law in Oklahoma. On April 4, 2018, the Respondent filed a Brief to Mitigate the Severity of Disciplinary Action in which she requested a hearing and asked that no final order of discipline be imposed based upon the Texas Judgment of Disbarment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 11 A hearing was held before the Professional Responsibility Tribunal on June 20, 2018. In the PRT's report they found the evidence presented before the Texas Evidentiary Panel established the Respondent settled a personal injury case on behalf of Veronica Gallegos, she received settlement funds but failed to deposit those funds into a separate trust account and never distributed those funds to her clients. The PRT also found that the Respondent did not dispute these facts at the June 20, 2018, hearing. Her testimony as well as her witness's testimony was compelling to support she was remorseful for her misconduct. Former Oklahoma County District Judge Kenneth Watson testified on her behalf. The Respondent worked for Watson for several years performing legal research and writing. Mr. Watson was impressed with her work and had no concern about the Respondent being readmitted to the practice of law in Oklahoma. His testimony also supported the Respondent's remorse for her misconduct. The Complainant's witness, OBA Investigator Krystal Willis, also testified that the Respondent was very cooperative during the investigation and complied with recommendations on how she should conduct her affairs. However, the PRT found the Respondent had no satisfactory explanation regarding the settlement funds she received and she could not dispute that she appeared to have benefited from and used those funds. Her misconduct in this case was found to be the same as in her earlier case where this Court determined \"respondent committed an act of commingling and conversion, neglected legal matters, failed to communicate with clients, failed to supervise an employee that resulted in the unauthorized practice of law, ...\"\n   <em>\n    State ex rel.

ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b6 14 Rule 7.7, RGDP allows a lawyer in a reciprocal disciplinary matter to file documentation to support a defense that the discipline imposed by another jurisdiction was not supported by the evidence or that the findings therein did not furnish sufficient grounds for discipline in Oklahoma. The Respondent was served and filed a pre-hearing brief to mitigate the severity of discipline. She made no allegations that the Judgment of Disbarment was not supported by the evidence, nor did she allege the findings therein do not support discipline in Oklahoma. Her pre-hearing brief in support of mitigation only asserts she has not taken any action warranting discipline in Oklahoma since her June 28, 2016, suspension by this Court and she has not engaged in any activity in Oklahoma that would endanger the interest of the public or erode the public confidence in the legal profession. She did not file a response to Complainant's post-hearing brief in support of discipline.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b6 15 We have conducted a\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   review of the record and find clear and convincing evidence that establishes the Respondent engaged in professional misconduct. Unlike\n   <em>\n    Gaines I\n   </em>\n   , it is clear here the Respondent conducted the settlement of the Gallegos sisters' personal injury matter and she received the settlement funds. Initially, she failed to properly supervise her non-lawyer staff person, Gipson, and failed to provide her clients a copy of a written and signed contingency fee agreement. She endorsed the settlement checks herself and cannot recall who endorsed the names of the Gallegos sisters, but she does not dispute the sisters' testimony that they did not endorse the checks nor authorize anyone else to endorse the checks. The funds were deposited into the Respondent's operating account and not her trust account. No funds were delivered to the Gallegos sisters, nor were necessary payments made to all third parties. She settled the Gallegos case and failed to notify her clients and provide them a settlement statement describing the outcome of the case. Over several years the Respondent failed to satisfy the sisters' requests for a status report. At the conclusion of the case she also failed to surrender any papers and property to her clients to which they were entitled. The Complainant's brief alleges the evidence conclusively establishes the Respondent misappropriated her clients' and third parties settlement proceeds. We agree. The Respondent's conduct violated the Oklahoma Rules of Professional Conduct, Rules 1.4 (a) (3) and (4)\n   <footnotemark>\n    46\n   </footnotemark>\n   (failure to keep client reasonably informed and promptly comply with reasonable requests for information), 1.5 (c)\n   <footnotemark>\n    47\n   </footnotemark>\n   (failure to\n   provide client with a copy of a written and signed contingency fee agreement), 1.15 (a)\n   <footnotemark>\n    48\n   </footnotemark>\n   (failure to safekeep and hold separately client funds), 1.15 (d)\n   <footnotemark>\n    49\n   </footnotemark>\n   (failure to promptly notify and deliver funds to client and interested third parties upon receipt), 1.16 (d)\n   <footnotemark>\n    50\n   </footnotemark>\n   (failure to promptly surrender client files and other property upon termination of representation), 5.3 (b)\n   <footnotemark>\n    51\n   </footnotemark>\n   (failure to properly supervise nonlawyer assistants), and 8.4 (c)\n   <footnotemark>\n    52\n   </footnotemark>\n   (engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, or deceit),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20Ohio%20St.%202011\">\n    5 O.S. 2011\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , ch. 1, app. 3-A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b6 16 In determining appropriate discipline it is proper to compare the matter at hand with previous disciplinary matters.\n   <em>\n    State ex rel.
