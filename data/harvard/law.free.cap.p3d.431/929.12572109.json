The jury found the presence of two aggravating circumstances: 1) the murder was especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel, and 2) the defendant posed a continuing threat to society, and set punishment as death. The trial court formally sentenced Appellant in accordance with the jury's verdict.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Appellant now appeals his conviction and sentence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b62 Appellant began working at the Teepee Totem convenience store in the town of Velma, Stephens County in May of 2012. He was twenty-one years old. Appellant lived outside of town with his grandparents. His cousin, Clayton Jenson, regularly drove him to work.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b63 After three weeks of training, Appellant began to close the store by himself. On June 6th, Jenson drove Appellant to work. They visited for 2 hours beforehand and discussed Appellant's plan to go to California so Appellant could be a mixed martial arts (\"MMA\") fighter. Jenson dropped Appellant off shortly before 2:00 p.m. Other than a sore throat, Appellant seemed absolutely normal to Jenson that day.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b64 Sixteen-year-old Braylee Henry drove into Velma around 7:30 p.m. to get an item from the grocery store. After completing this task, Henry went into the Teepee Totem to get some candy and a soda fountain drink. Through Appellant's admissions to his psychological expert, we know that Appellant attacked Henry while she was filing a cup at the fountain. He struck Henry and took her to the ground. He strangled Henry with a choke hold and dragged her into the store's stockroom.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b65 Henry played basketball for her school and was in good shape. Once inside the storeroom, she fought back. Appellant attacked Henry a second time. He repeatedly hit her. Appellant brutally beat Henry's head, face, neck, and chest. Appellant dragged Henry across the room causing her head to strike the floor. He stomped on her head, neck, arm, and upper back with his shoe. Appellant's prolonged savagery resulted in Henry's death. She asphyxiated on the blood in her lungs and died from the blunt force trauma to her head and neck.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b66 Appellant then took steps to conceal what he had done and flee to California. He put a sack around Henry's head and placed her body inside a shopping cart. Appellant covered Henry's body with boxes, pushed the cart out to Henry's car, and placed her body inside the back seat. Appellant gathered up peanut butter, sunflower seeds, a toothbrush, rubbing alcohol, and razors from the store's shelves and placed them in the car. He drove Henry's car to a semi-secluded area on his grandparent's land and removed her body from the car. Appellant completely undressed Henry from the waist down and pulled her jacket, tank-top, and sports bra up until they fully exposed her breasts. He dragged Henry's body to a muddy spot in the field and partially covered it with dirt and vegetation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b67 Appellant went inside his grandparent's home, put a clean shirt over the top of the shirt he was wearing, and collected additional items for his trip, including boots, clothing, hydrogen peroxide, and his wallet. Recognizing that it was too early for Appellant to be home from work, his grandfather, Stanley Bench, asked Appellant if he had quit or been fired. Appellant simply responded, \"Yes.\" Appellant informed Mr. Bench that he was leaving. He went outside and washed himself in the water spigot. When he was done, he stuck his head back inside the door and declared; \"Pa, I love you.\" Mr. Bench responded; \"I do you too. Be careful out there and don't get hurt.\" Appellant stated, \"Okay,\" and left.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b68 Tammy Wilkerson ventured into the Teepee Totem around 8:15 that evening. She was alarmed to discover that the clerk was missing from the store. When she looked into the storeroom she discovered a pool of blood. Wilkerson called the Velma Police Department and contacted, Melissa Lynn, one of the other store clerks who lived nearby.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b69 When Henry failed to return on time, her mother went looking for her. She contacted law enforcement when she was unable to find Henry.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b610 The Stephen's County Sheriff's Department investigated Appellant's absence from the store. Deputy Michael Moore documented the interior of the convenience store\n   and obtained a DNA sample from the pool of blood in the storeroom. Deputy David Martin went to the home of Appellant's grandparents to check on Appellant's welfare. Using canine officers, Lieutenant Chad Powell discovered Henry's nude body in the nearby field. The officers put out a \"BOLO\" alert for Henry's car.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b611 Deputy Quinton Short of the Custer County Sheriff's Department received the alert and observed Henry's vehicle headed west on Interstate 40. He stopped the car and approached it on foot. Short observed in plain sight a large amount of blood in the backseat. He discovered Appellant seated in the driver's seat and ordered him to exit the car. Once outside the sedan, Appellant spontaneously declared that he was not driving the vehicle. Slightly confounded by Appellant's assertion, Short responded; \"Then whose vehicle is it?\" Appellant then stated; \"I think I f****d up, I may have killed somebody.\" Deputy Short observed that Appellant had blood on his clothing. He took Appellant into custody and transported him to the Custer County Jail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b612 Chief Investigator Robert Short of the Custer County Sheriff's Department observed that Appellant had dirt on his face as well as on the shoulder of his shirt. He further noticed that Appellant had blood on his shirt, shoes, and socks. There was a mixture of blood and dirt on the bottom of Appellant's shoes. Short further observed that Appellant's hands were red and swollen.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b613 Detention Officer, Kendall Brown, booked Appellant into the Custer County Jail. While Brown was gathering Appellant's information, Appellant interjected several admissions. Appellant informed Brown; \"I think I might have messed up. I think I may have killed somebody.\" Later, Appellant mentioned; \"I might have blacked out.\" Appellant asked Brown if he would be able to make bond. After Brown advised Appellant that he did not know, Appellant spontaneously stated; \"I think I murdered someone. The officer in the car mentioned manslaughter *** isn't manslaughter murder?\" Still later, Appellant volunteered; \"I think Stephens County is gonna come get me.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b614 Appellant repeatedly engaged Brown in small talk. Some of his statements evinced prior knowledge concerning the mental health system. Appellant volunteered that he had undergone \"psych evaluations\" while in the military and added that the \"dude in the straight-jacket\" is usually the one screaming that he is \"not crazy.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b615 Appellant attempted to develop grounds for an insanity plea from his conversation with Brown; Appellant asked where he was at? After Brown indicated that he was in Arapaho in Custer County, Appellant stated; \"If they believe that I don't know where I am at they might believe that I was crazy.\" Thereafter, Appellant queried: \"Since I blacked out do you think that I should go for an insanity plea or what?\" Brown informed Appellant that he could not give him any legal advice whatsoever.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b616 Investigator Justin Scott of the Stephens County District Attorney's Office executed a search warrant on Appellant's person. Appellant also spontaneously volunteered a statement to Scott. Appellant asked if Oklahoma had the death penalty. When Scott answered that under certain circumstances they do, Appellant declared that he needed death or needed to be locked away in the big house. Scott noticed that Appellant had a bite mark on his elbow.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b617 Forensic testing revealed that Henry's DNA profile matched the DNA profile of the blood discovered in the storeroom. Similarly, Henry's profile matched the DNA profile of the blood found on Appellant's shoes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    ISSUES RELATING TO JURY SELECTION AND COMPOSITION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b618 In Proposition I Appellant contends that the trial court erred when it denied his pretrial request for a change of venue. He argues that this action denied him his right to an impartial jury and a fundamentally fair trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b619 The Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial \"'guarantees to the criminally accused a fair trial by a panel of impartial, 'indifferent jurors' \" and it is a basic requirement of due\n   process that an accused receive a fair trial in a fair tribunal.\n   <em>\n    DeRosa v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9264250\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/89/1124/\">\n    2004 OK CR 19\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 17,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9264250\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/89/1124/\">\n    89 P.3d 1124\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1133 (\n   <em>\n    quoting\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Irvin v.

Likewise, Article II, Section 20 of the Oklahoma Constitution and 22 O.S.2011, \u00a7 561 guarantee a criminal defendant a fair trial by an impartial jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b620 We note that Henry's murder occurred in the small, rural farming community known as Velma. The town is approximately 18 miles southeast of Duncan, the county seat of Stephens County and where the trial took place.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b621 Appellant timely filed an application for change of venue prior to trial. He cited to the titles of approximately 125 news articles appearing in either print, television or online. However, he did not include the content of the actual articles. It appears that not all of the cited articles actually referenced the instant case.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   We also note that many of the cited news sources were not from the local community in which the crime occurred but were from sources throughout the state and across the globe as a whole.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Several of the cited titles appear to be from news aggregator websites.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Other articles belonged to online groups requiring admission to the group prior to accessing the cited blog.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, many of the cited articles would not necessarily have been readily available in the local community. After the trial court denied his application, Appellant filed a motion to reconsider and attached the contents of 9 of the cited articles. The district court denied Appellant's renewed request.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b622 The trial court conducted individual\n   <em>\n    voir dire\n   </em>\n   of the venire concerning the death penalty, prior knowledge concerning the offense and pretrial publicity. Appellant did not renew his pretrial request for a change of venue at any point during\n   <em>\n    voir dire\n   </em>\n   . As such, we find that he has waived appellate review of this issue for all but plain error.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hain v.

First, there are rare instances in which prejudice is presumed.

The\n   <em>\n    voir dire\n   </em>\n   record reflects a fair and impartial jury venire which was not predisposed to convict Appellant. The trial court ultimately called 101 individuals to fill the venire. The transcript of the proceedings reveals that 53 of the venire members, a little over 50%, had received information about the case through the media, co-workers, friends or family. Many of them had received limited information about the case. Some had only heard about the offense when it had first happened. Others had only caught the passing words of an acquaintance. The trial court excused 9 individuals for cause because they were unable to set aside what they knew about the offense and decide the case based upon the evidence presented in court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Therefore, less than 10% of the venire members possessed a partiality which could not be laid aside.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00b630 Although the trial court took note that the case carried emotion in the close-knit town of Velma, where the offense occurred, this sentiment did not appear to carry over into the remainder of Stephens County. Many of the venire members who were ultimately excused due to partiality, lived, worked or had a similar connection to the town of Velma. However, the trial court was not required to go to great lengths to select jurors who appeared impartial from the other parts of Stephens County.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Murphy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"541496\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/421/794/\">\n    421 U.S. at 802-03\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"541496\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/421/794/\">\n    95 S.Ct. at 2037\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding length which trial court must go in order to select jurors who appear impartial is another factor relevant in evaluating atmosphere of community). The predominant reason that the trial court excused an individual from other parts of the county was due to their inability to consider all three punishment options. As discussed above, the news articles about the case were largely factual in nature. After individual questioning, defense counsel was not compelled to challenge the partiality of the venire. For these reasons, we conclude that the atmosphere within the community was not so inflammatory as to suggest that Appellant could not receive a fair trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b631 Similarly, the\n   <em>\n    voir dire\n   </em>\n   statements of the individual jurors do not suggest a general partiality or an inflammatory atmosphere. Although they were individually questioned, none of the venire members excused for partiality\n   either glorified Henry or expressed a strong sentiment against Appellant. Instead, the individuals simply expressed their inability to be impartial by stating or confirming that they could not set aside what they knew about the offense and decide the case based on the evidence presented at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   \u00b632 Focusing on the jurors who were actually impaneled, we find that Appellant received a fair trial by a panel of impartial, indifferent jurors. We note that \"[q]ualified jurors need not ... be totally ignorant of the facts and issues involved.\"\n   <em>\n    Murphy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"541496\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/421/794/\">\n    421 U.S. at 799-800\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"541496\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/421/794/\">\n    95 S.Ct. at 2036\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \"It is sufficient if the juror can lay aside his impression or opinion and render a verdict based on the evidence presented in court.\"\n   <em>\n    Irvin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1285471\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/366/717/#p722\">\n    366 U.S. at 723\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1285471\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/366/717/#p722\">\n    81 S.Ct. at 1643\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   \u00b633 The record establishes that 4 of the impaneled jurors (A.R., C.C., M.H., and R.R.) had not received any information about the case. Although 8 of the impaneled jurors had received some information about the cases prior to being summoned, this exposure was minimal. Jurors D.B., R.G., and L.W. had not seen any media reports about the case but had heard about it from someone else. Jurors M.R. and S.G. had seen media reports about the case but were too preoccupied with other parts of their lives to pay much attention to it. Jurors G.W., R.M., and L.R. had simply heard about the offense when it first happened but did not know the details of the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   \u00b634 Regardless of the level of pretrial exposure to the facts of the case, the record establishes that all of the impaneled jurors were both indifferent and impartial. The trial court asked and each and every member of the panel, including the three alternates, expressly affirmed that they could set aside any prior knowledge or opinions regarding the case and decide the case based upon the evidence presented at trial. All of the impaneled jurors indicated, in one form or another, that they could be impartial as to both guilt and punishment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   \u00b635 Appellant has not shown that any of the jurors who were actually impaneled were challengeable for cause. As no individual sat on the jury that could not set aside his or her impression or opinion and render a verdict based on the evidence presented in court, we find that Appellant was not denied a fundamentally fair trial.

It is patently clear that Appellant was in custody. However, the trial court's determination that Appellant voluntarily made the statements without any interrogation is not clearly against the logic and effect of the facts presented.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   \u00b646 Appellant's statements to Brown were preceded by his spontaneous declaration to Deputy Quinton Short; \"I think I f****d up, I may have killed somebody.\" Short took Appellant into custody and transported him to the Custer County Jail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Detention Officer Brown contacted Appellant as soon as the arresting officers brought him into the jail and sat him in the back of the room. Brown started gathering Appellant's biographical information to get a head start on the booking process. This exchange was captured on the jail's recording system and introduced into evidence at the pretrial hearing. Brown asked Appellant the necessary questions to book him into the jail, including his name, date of birth, height, weight, eye color, place of birth, current address, marital status, telephone, medical issues, and current medications. Brown simply asked Appellant for the requisite information and did not make any small talk. When Brown asked if he had any allergies to any medications, Appellant said; \"[I've] been losing my voice lately.\" Brown followed up and asked; \"Sick or something with a cold or flu?\" Appellant stated; \"I got a problem. I know I did something wrong. I just blacked out.\" Brown remarked; \"Dude, I don't have nothing to do with anything like that.\" Appellant replied; \"I know.\" Then he stated, \"It's bad.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   \u00b647 After Appellant's admission, Brown returned to asking Appellant the computer generated booking questions, including his social security number, emergency contact, whether Appellant was addicted to any drugs or alcohol which would cause him to have withdrawal symptoms during his stay in the jail, and whether Appellant had any identifying tattoos. Appellant disclosed that he had a tattoo of \"PX SPEC\" on his left upper arm. Brown sought to clarify the nature of the tattoo. When he correctly recognized it as military, Appellant became very talkative.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   \u00b648 Brown was unable to complete the booking process. Instead, he was forced to wait until the arresting officers released Appellant from the back of the room so he could bring him up to the front and go over the information entered into the computer. During the interim, Brown answered Appellant's many questions and generally chatted with Appellant about the military and guns.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   \u00b649 Brown related at trial that he did not interrogate Appellant but simply engaged in small talk like he did with most arrestees to make them easier to deal with and make the booking process go smoother. After a time, both men fell silent. Without Brown making any statement or question, Appellant bluntly stated; \"I think I may have killed somebody.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Brown advised Appellant, \"Dude, don't tell me,\" and fell silent again.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   \u00b650 Since Appellant had made the previous admissions and Brown knew the jail's recording system did not always accurately capture entire conversations, Brown used his phone to record Appellant's statements. Appellant returned to asking Brown questions. He asked Brown if he was a jailer? He, then, asked if Brown had seen any interesting characters. Brown answered; \"Interesting? No. Crazy? Yes.\" He related anecdotes about two colorful inmates that had been held in the jail. Appellant volunteered that the military required \"psych evaluations\" and added that the \"dude in the straight-jacket\" is usually the one screaming that he is \"not crazy.\" He further stated; \"we all have to be a little crazy to keep from going insane.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   \u00b651 When the arresting officers returned, they checked on Brown's progress booking Appellant into the jail. They released Appellant from the back of the room so Brown could complete the process. After Brown moved him to the front of the room, Appellant freely chatted with Brown. When he asked; \"Is there some detective or someone I can talk to?,\" Brown advised him; \"I don't know.\" Appellant asked about the list of Bondsman on the wall and Brown explained how bonds worked. After Appellant asked if he could write down their numbers, Brown related that Appellant was only being temporarily held in his county.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   \u00b652 Appellant queried where he was at and Brown informed him that he was in Arapaho in Custer County. Appellant then spontaneously declared; \"If they believe that I don't know where I am at they might believe that I was crazy.\" Brown made no response to this statement. Appellant followed up by asking; \"Do you think that I'll make bond at all?\" Brown responded; \"I have no idea, dude. I don't know if you have charges or are gonna have charges. I don't have a clue.\" Appellant then volunteered; \"I think I murdered someone. The officer in the car mentioned manslaughter ... isn't manslaughter murder?\" Brown advised Appellant that he was unable to tell him and explained that he was just a jailer, did not know anything about the law, and simply booked people into the jail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   \u00b653 Brown informed Appellant that \"technically\" he was not booking Appellant into the jail but was simply showing that he was there. When Appellant stated, \"I think Stephens County is gonna come get me,\" Brown did not respond. Appellant then asked Brown; \"Since I blacked out, do you think that I should go for an insanity plea or what?\" Brown finally drove home his point by advising Appellant; \"I can't give you any legal opinions whatsoever.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   \u00b654 After a period of silence, Brown asked Appellant some additional medical questions and quickly confirmed the information that Appellant had previously given him. He had Appellant read over the jail rules and acknowledge his receipt of the same; execute a statement accounting for Appellant's property; and certify his answers to the medical questions. After completing the booking process, Brown gave Appellant a blanket and placed him in one of the cells in the jail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   \u00b655 Based upon the totality of the circumstances, we find that the trial court properly rejected Appellant's motion to suppress. The record plainly supports the trial court's determination that Appellant voluntarily made the statements without any interrogation. Brown's questions to Appellant fell squarely within the \"routine booking question\" exception. The questions which Brown asked Appellant were clearly not designed to elicit incriminatory admissions. Thus, Appellant was not subject to interrogation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   \u00b656 Instead, Appellant's statements were the product of an essentially free and unconstrained choice on his part. The record shows that Appellant was predisposed to confess and explain away his offense. Appellant's admissions were volunteered. The great majority of his statements were made when Brown paused his book-in questions or was simply silent. Appellant's inculpatory statements did not directly respond to any of Brown's questions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   \u00b657 Appellant argues that his statements should have been suppressed because Brown went outside the scope of the ordinary booking questions. We are not persuaded by this argument. Although Brown engaged in small talk with Appellant, his questions were certainly\n   not the kind which an officer should know were reasonably likely to elicit incriminating statements. As such, we conclude that Appellant was not subjected to custodial interrogation or its functional equivalent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   \u00b658 The trial court's determination that Appellant volunteered the statements is not clearly against the weight and effect of the facts presented. Accordingly, we find that the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it admitted Appellant's admissions at trial.

The photographs admitted as State's Exhibit Numbers 501 through 518 depicted Henry's injuries. State's Exhibit Humber 501 showed Henry's face, head, and shoulders. The remaining photographs were close up images of the abrasions, contusions and trauma which Henry suffered. The photographs do not depict the work of the medical examiner but solely display Henry's injuries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   \u00b664 The challenged exhibits held great probative value. The photographs accurately depicted the nature, extent and location of Henry's wounds, established the\n   <em>\n    corpus delicti\n   </em>\n   , and corroborated the medical examiner's testimony. They were neither extensive nor cumulative. Each photograph depicted a different aspect or injury on Henry's body. The medical examiner, Dr. Inas Yacoub, extensively\n   relied upon the exhibits to illustrate to the jury the blunt force trauma to which Henry had been subjected and explain how that ultimately caused her death. As such, we find that the probative value of Exhibit Numbers 501 through 518 was not substantially outweighed by their prejudicial effect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   \u00b665 The photographs admitted as State's Exhibit Numbers 519 through 523 depicted the blood-soaked clothing which Henry had worn that night. Appellant's claim that this evidence was gruesome is not well taken. As with the other challenged exhibits, the photographs of Henry's clothing held great probative value. The exhibits were probative of the nature, extent and location of Henry's wounds and corroborated the testimony of the State's witnesses. The blood-soaked nature of the clothing tended to establish the force and violence to which Henry was subjected and corroborated the medical examiner's determination that her death was caused by blunt force trauma. Thus, we find that the probative value of Exhibit Numbers 519 through 523 was not substantially outweighed by their prejudicial effect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   \u00b666 Appellant argues that the photos were not necessary to prove the State's case. He asserts that Dr. Yacoub's testimony and the diagrams in her report adequately covered Henry's wounds and the cause of death. This Court has repeatedly rejected the argument that photographs are not relevant if the cause of death is not contested.\n   <em>\n    Smallwood v.

There was not any evidence to support an instruction upon second degree depraved mind murder. Neither the State nor Appellant presented evidence evincing that Appellant engaged in conduct akin to shooting into a crowd,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   imminently dangerous conduct done without the intention of taking the life of any particular individual. Thus, no reasonable view of the evidence gives rise to the inference that Appellant's conduct evinced a depraved mind in extreme disregard of human life.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   \u00b678 Similarly, there was not any evidence showing that Appellant acted without the intention of taking the life of any particular individual. Appellant's sole defense at trial was that he was legally insane at the time of the offense. During opening argument, defense counsel admitted that Appellant had taken Henry's life and asserted that Appellant's actions did not make any sense because Appellant was insane. Appellant offered the testimony of forensic psychologist, Curtis Grundy, Ph.D., to support this defense. Grundy testified as to Appellant's mental health and sanity but did not render any opinion about Appellant's ability to form the intent to kill at the time of the offense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   \u00b679 During Dr. Grundy's evaluation, Appellant made several statements concerning Henry's murder. Dr. Grundy related these statements to the jury. The trial court determined that Appellant's statements concerning the offense evinced that he had intentionally taken Henry's life. As the trial court's conclusion is not clearly against the weight and effect of the facts presented, we are bound to accept this interpretation of the evidence. Appellant admitted that he had intentionally taken Henry's life but sought to excuse that act under the notion that he acted under an insane delusion that he killed somebody who he believed had intended to kill him. In light of Appellant's and defense counsel's admissions, we find that no rational jury could conclude that Appellant acted without the intention of taking Henry's life.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   \u00b680 In the absence of any evidence showing both that Appellant's conduct evinced a depraved mind in extreme disregard of human life and that he acted without the intention of taking the life of any particular individual, we must conclude that the evidence would not have permitted a rational jury to find Appellant guilty of second degree depraved mind murder. Therefore, we find that the trial court properly refused Appellant's request for an instruction upon this lesser included offense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   \u00b681 At the same time, we conclude that the evidence would not have permitted a rational jury to acquit Appellant of the charged offense of first degree murder. Deputy Quinton Short testified that Appellant informed him; \"I think that I F****d up. I may have killed somebody.\" Detention Officer Kendall Brown testified that when he later encountered Appellant in the jail, Appellant advised him; \"I got a problem. I know I did something wrong ... I think I may have killed somebody.\" The medical examiner's testimony established that Appellant subjected Henry to a prolonged, brutal, and relentless attack. Dr. Inas Yacoub testified that Henry had extensive blunt force trauma to her head, face, scalp, neck and upper torso which resulted in internal bleeding. She also had bruises on her legs, arms, and hands. Sufficient pressure had been applied to Henry's neck to cause the fracture of the cricoid cartilage, petechiae in both eyes, and bleeding in the lining of her airways. Yacoub explained that\n   the numerous injuries could not be explained by a single impact. Henry also had pattern injuries on her head, neck, arm, and upper back which were consistent with the bottom of Appellant's shoes. The photographs of Henry's injuries and the clothing that she wore on the night of her death thoroughly corroborated Dr. Yacoub's explanation. As no reasonable view of the evidence would permit a rational jury to acquit Appellant of first degree murder, we find that the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it refused Appellant's request for an instruction upon second degree depraved mind murder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   \u00b682 Since Appellant has not shown that the evidence presented at trial would permit a rational jury to find him guilty of second degree depraved mind murder and acquit him of first degree murder we find the trial court did not violate Appellant's federal due process rights under\n   <em>\n    Beck\n   </em>\n   . Proposition V is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   \u00b683 In Proposition VI, Appellant contends that Dr. Terese Hall rendered improper expert opinion testimony. He argues that Hall improperly vouched for the credibility of the State's witnesses while dismissing the credibility of key defense witnesses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   \u00b684 Appellant concedes that he waived appellate review of this issue when he failed to object to Hall's testimony at the time of trial. Therefore, we review Appellant's claim pursuant to the test set forth in\n   <em>\n    Simpson v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"224\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1994%20OK%20CR%2040\">\n    1994 OK CR 40\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10352673\" index=\"225\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/876/690/\">\n    876 P.2d 690\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and determine whether Appellant has shown an actual error, which is plain or obvious, and which affects his substantial rights.\n   <em>\n    Tollett v.

Appellant presented the testimony of forensic psychologist, Curtis Grundy, Ph.D., and the State presented the testimony of forensic psychologist, Terese Hall, Ph.D., in rebuttal. Both Dr. Grundy and Dr. Hall testified that in forming their respective opinions they relied upon information from people who had interacted with Appellant both before and after Henry's murder, including Appellant's immediate family members and members of law enforcement. Both also testified that they compared and contrasted the individuals' numerous statements in arriving at their final opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   \u00b686 Appellant lived with his grandparents at the time of the offense. Both Dr. Grundy and Dr. Hall related that they had received two different sets of information from Appellant's grandparents. Their accounts had changed over time. Appellant's grandfather, Stanley Bench, testified at preliminary hearing approximately five months after the offense. Mr. Bench advised that there was nothing wrong with Appellant. When he met with Dr. Grundy approximately two years after the offense, Mr. Bench gave a different account. Mr. Bench indicated that a month prior to the offense, Appellant began mumbling to himself; he had trouble sleeping and stayed up all night; he banged on his bedroom wall and spoke in two different voices; and he stopped showering and grooming himself. Mr. Bench further indicated that Appellant advised that he had an implant in his brain like the Manchurian Candidate; a man and a woman from the Navy were after him; they had come into the store trying to kill him; and he was going to have to do something about them if they didn't stop.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   \u00b687 Appellant's grandmother, Albertha Bench, initially indicated that Appellant lived in a world of make believe; he thought that he had seen spirits; was sometimes depressed and moody; did not like authority; was easily angered; and believed that he was smarter than everyone else. A few of Mrs. Bench's statements indicated that Appellant may have had some paranoia. She related that Appellant had advised her that he thought someone was after him and he came into her room one night because he thought something was in his room. At preliminary hearing, Mrs. Bench simply described Appellant as \"a little mental.\" When Dr. Grundy evaluated Appellant two years after the offense, Mrs. Bench's relation of mental health\n   concerns about Appellant had substantially grown. Despite the fact that she worked the graveyard shift and did not regularly see Appellant, Mrs. Bench related that Appellant was irrational; went without sleep for 4 or 5 days at a time; hit her bedroom wall at night; did not shower or groom himself; claimed that he was Jason Bourne or a spy; claimed that he had a chip in his head like the Manchurian Candidate; and repeatedly came into her room at night claiming that he was scared. Mrs. Bench indicated Appellant stated that he saw heads coming out of the closet after him, the apparition of a little girl in a white dress, and a man and a woman on these occasions. He further advised her that a man and a woman wanted to kill him, they had a hit out on him, and they had come into the convenience store, again.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   \u00b688 Dr. Grundy testified that he heavily relied upon the statements of Mr. and Mrs. Bench in reaching the conclusion that Appellant had schizophrenia, suffered a psychotic break with delusions and was legally insane at the time of the offense. Testifying in rebuttal, Dr. Hall related that although Appellant had some psychological problems she did not see any signs of severe psychosis in him. She did not believe that he was sufficiently impaired at the time of the crime to render him unable to know right from wrong. Explaining why she reached a different conclusion than Dr. Grundy, she noted the inconsistencies in the grandparent's statements over time. Dr. Hall testified that she \"discounted\" the later statements because she felt that the statements both given under oath and closer in time to the offense were more reliable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   \u00b689 Appellant challenges Hall's statement about her discounting as improper vouching.

Hall did not indicate a personal belief as to whether Mr. and Mrs. Bench were either lying or telling the truth. Instead, she simply explained why she relied upon certain facts more than other facts. We note that the challenged statement was part of Hall's explanation for why she reached a different opinion than Dr. Grundy. It is clear from the record that forensic psychologists reasonably rely upon such assessments in forming their opinions. Thus, Hall properly disclosed the discounting as part of the facts underlying her opinion that were different from Dr. Grundy's assessment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   \u00b692 Appellant also challenges Hall's statement that she took Mr. and Mrs. Bench's later statements with a grain of salt. Not satisfied with Hall's explanation that she had discounted the later statements, the prosecutor pushed Hall into testimony that nearly crossed the line of propriety. The prosecutor\n   clarified that Hall had heard Dr. Grundy's discussion of individuals' \"motivations [ ] to fabricate or elaborate or lie\" and then obtained Hall's admission, \"Yes\" that she had taken the Benches' \"later statements with a grain of salt\" \"because of that.\" This exchange very nearly placed Hall in the position of rendering an opinion as to whether the Benches were lying or telling the truth. As Hall did not testify as to what motivation she believed the Benches held, we find that Appellant has not shown an actual error that was plain or obvious.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   \u00b693 Appellant further asserts that Hall vouched for the testimony of Clayton Jenson when she stated that he was worthy of belief because he was consistent in his statements to both law enforcement and to her. Appellant's claim is not supported by the record. Hall never remarked that Jenson was worthy of belief. When Hall initially disclosed that she had received two different sets of information from Appellant's family she mentioned that she would discuss Jenson separately because he \"was the same throughout.\" Later, she related what Jenson had told her. Hall did not render any opinion as to whether Jenson was lying or telling the truth. She did not indicate a personal belief in Jenson's testimony at trial. As such, we conclude that Appellant has not shown the existence of an actual error in Hall's testimony about Jenson's statements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   \u00b694 Appellant also argues that Hall contended that jail administrator Dallas Cowen was trustworthy. Again, this assertion is not supported by the record. Hall did not testify that Cowen was trustworthy. The record shows that the prosecutor continued to explore why Hall's opinion differed from Dr. Grundy's opinion. Hall affirmed that she had information from Cowen as to how Appellant acted differently when a doctor or attorney visited him which Dr. Grundy did not have. She also affirmed that she thought it would have been important for Dr. Grundy to have had this information. Hall did not render any opinion as to whether Cowen lied or told the truth. She did not indicate a personal belief in Cowen's statement. As such, we conclude that Appellant has not shown the existence of an actual error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   \u00b695 Finally, Appellant claims that Hall impermissibly stated her belief that Appellant's family was not credible and implied that Dr. Grundy's reliance on the family was misplaced. We are not persuaded by this argument. Hall testified: \"[I] think Dr. Grundy considered the family information that was offered later on to be highly credible and I did not. I think that is the main difference.\" Again, this was part of Hall's explanation as to why she reached a different conclusion than Grundy. Hall did not render any opinion as to whether the Benches were lying or telling the truth. She did not tell the jury who to believe. As such, we find that Appellant has not shown the existence of an actual error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   \u00b696 In the heading of this proposition of error, Appellant outlines that Hall's testimony rendered his trial fundamentally unfair in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. As Appellant has not provided any argument or authority supporting this claim, we find that he has forfeited appellate review of the issue.

Appellant's slaying of Henry was both brutal and callous. His treatment of her body after her death further evinced this fact.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   \u00b6101 In addition to the facts of the crime itself, the evidence showed that Appellant had violently attacked a family member. James Zolinski of the Will County Sheriff's Department in Illinois testified that on July 27, 2008, he responded to a domestic altercation involving a father and a son at Appellant's home. Deputy Zolinski found Appellant's stepfather, Farlan Huff, with facial injuries. Huff's eye was almost swollen shut. He also had a cut above it. Appellant was seventeen years old at that time. He did not have any injuries on this person. After interviewing all of the parties present at the home, Zolinski arrested Appellant for domestic abuse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   \u00b6102 Farlan Huff testified and detailed what had occurred. Huff related that Appellant and he became embroiled in an argument after he reminded Appellant to complete his chore of taking the trash out. Appellant's mother, Dana Huff, heard the argument and came up to Appellant's room. She directed Appellant and Mr. Huff; \"Just duke it out.\" Mistakenly, Mr. Huff took off his glasses and placed them on top of something. Before he turned completely back around, Appellant punched him in the\n   eye. Appellant then placed Mr. Huff in a \"sleeper hold\" restricting the circulation in his neck. As Mr. Huff was starting to pass out, he called out; \"Dana, if you let him-.\" Appellant did not stop until Mrs. Huff directed him to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   \u00b6103 Appellant had training in hand-to-hand combat, in addition to his Naval training. Dana Huff and Albertha Bench testified that Appellant had received training in martial arts. Mrs. Bench indicated that Appellant practiced regularly while staying in her home. Clayton Jenson testified that Appellant desired to go to California and become a mixed martial arts fighter. Appellant's attack on Mr. Huff mirrored the choke-hold he later used to subdue Henry.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   \u00b6104 The evidence further showed that Appellant had a long history of sexually aggressive conduct towards females that escalated over time and culminated in him callously slaying Henry and pitilessly leaving her semi-nude body in a field. Karen Doyle testified that in July of 2005 she moved into the house behind Appellant's home. Appellant was fourteen years old at that time. On several occasions Doyle observed Appellant through a window as she swam in her backyard pool. Appellant appeared to be masturbating. During Labor Day Weekend, Appellant's sexual aggression toward Doyle intensified. Doyle heard Appellant shouting \"F**k Me, F**k Me\" as she came out of the water. When she glanced towards Appellant's home, she observed that Appellant was completely nude and leaning halfway out of his bedroom window with his hands in the air. Doyle was frightened and called the police. Although she continued to live behind Appellant's home, she remained fearful of him. Despite law enforcement's intervention, Doyle continued to notice someone peeking out of the blinds after this incident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   \u00b6105 Appellant's criminal activity and level of violence continued to escalate after his discharge from the Navy. In what can only be perceived as an act of planning, Appellant began to approach those who appeared to be young and female in or near the convenience store. He made physical contact with their bodies and attempted to entice or lure them to be alone with him. The evidence showed that Appellant inappropriately touched sixteen-year-old Jesse Anderson only days before Henry's murder. Anderson testified that Appellant visited the sno-cone stand across the street from the Teepee Totem where she worked. Appellant spoke to Anderson but the conversation was nothing more than casual customer conversation. On June 2, 2012, Appellant chased Anderson as she was driving off in her car. He ran across the street and tapped on her car window until she stopped and rolled down the window. Appellant advised Anderson that he did not think it was right that she leave without them knowing each other's names. Anderson exchanged names with Appellant. When he stuck his hand out as if to shake her hand Anderson reciprocated the gesture. Instead of shaking hands, Appellant kissed Anderson's hand. He asked Anderson for her phone number, her address, where she was going, and if he could ever take her out on a date. Anderson was freaked out by Appellant's behavior. She did not feel that she knew Appellant well enough and did not consent to his kiss. She refused to provide Appellant the information he had requested and declined his request for a date. Anderson was sufficiently bothered by the incident that she reported it to her parents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   \u00b6106 Thereafter, Appellant sexually assaulted Gina Mercer. 21 O.S.2011, \u00a7 112 (defining \"sexual assault\" to include \"any type of sexual contact or behavior that occurs without explicit consent of the recipient including, but not limited to ... fondling\"). Mercer testified that approximately four or five days before Henry's murder Appellant inappropriately touched her while she was shopping in the Teepee Totem. Mercer related that she entered the store with her daughter. Other than Appellant, no one else was in the store. Appellant came up behind Mercer while she was at the soda fountain. He put his arms around Mercer under her breasts. She exclaimed; \"Don't touch me! I don't even know who you are,\" and slapped Appellant on the shoulder. In response, Appellant declared; \"I'm sorry. I thought you were a high school girl.\" Mercer related that Appellant's actions were completely unwelcome, inappropriate\n   and unacceptable. She reported this incident to the store owner. After Henry's death, Mercer realized the gravity of the situation and reported the incident to law enforcement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   \u00b6107 The day before Henry's murder, Appellant had a lewd encounter with fifteen-year-old Breanna Stinchcomb while she was shopping at the Teepee Totem. 21 O.S.2011, \u00a7 1123 (lewdly touching, feeling or mauling the body of a child under 16 constitutes lewd molestation). Stinchcomb testified as to her eerie encounter with Appellant. She related that Appellant came up behind her while she was at the glass door to the refrigerated soda cans so she turned and walked to the candy section and picked up two packages of candy. Appellant followed her to the soda fountain machine. Although the cups were perfectly straight, Appellant came up next to her, reached his right arm around her and acted as if he was straightening up the cups. As he did so, the side of his body came into contact with Stinchcomb. Appellant commented on Stinchcomb's attractiveness. He moved his hand and asked her if she wanted to go in the back and exchange life stories. Stinchcomb declined Appellant's offer stating that her mother was outside waiting on her. Appellant continued to make Stinchcomb feel uncomfortable as he rang up her purchase at the register. He advised her that he was only working at the store to make enough money to get back into the Navy. He asked Stinchcomb about her interests. When he found out that Stinchcomb liked music, he advised her that he played the guitar and suggested that they hang out and play the guitar together. Appellant's actions scared Stinchcomb and she immediately advised her mother about his behavior once she was safely outside.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   \u00b6108 Appellant suggests on appeal that these incidents showed nothing more than \"harmless indiscretion,\" \"overly-friendly attempts to converse with women,\" or \"crass\" behavior. However, viewing these incidents in the context of the remainder of the evidence, we find that the incidents clearly demonstrate that Appellant's behavior displayed a pattern of escalation tending to indicate a likelihood of future violence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   \u00b6109 We note that the evidence concerning Appellant's attempts to escape also tended to show that Appellant would be a continuing threat to society. The evidence showed that Appellant had fled from his unlawful transgressions in the past and committed additional crimes along the way. Deputy David Matthew Welsh of the Will County Sheriff's Office in Wilmington, Illinois testified that Appellant admitted to stealing a car while he was AWOL from the Navy. He hid at the home of one of his friends.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   \u00b6110 The State's evidence further established that while awaiting trial, Appellant escaped from a restraint chair and attempted to escape from the jail. Detention Officer, Timothy Jackson, testified that Appellant was placed into a restraint chair because he had rammed his head into a wall. Appellant escaped from the chair and into a different part of the jail. He took off his orange jail uniform, put on a trustee's green uniform, and used this uniform to gain entry into other areas of the jail. Supervisor, Nathan Hicks, testified that Appellant used the trustee's clothing to make his way towards the exit to the jail. As the jail employees searched for him, Appellant ducked into a holding cell near the jail's exit. When Hicks found Appellant hiding in the cell, Hicks asked him what he was doing. Appellant admitted that he was trying to get out. Detention Officer, Kyle Henson, asked Appellant what had been his whole point, and Appellant indicated; \"It was worth a try.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   \u00b6111 Viewed in its entirety, Appellant's behavior coupled with the callous and pitiless nature of the slaying demonstrated a threat to society and a probability that this threat would continue to exist in the future. Thus, taking the evidence in the light most favorable to the State, we find that any rational trier of fact could have found the continuing threat aggravating circumstance beyond a reasonable doubt. Proposition IX is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   \u00b6112 In Proposition X, Appellant contends that the especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel aggravating circumstance is unconstitutionally vague and overbroad. Similar to many others before him, Appellant argues that this Court's attempts to limit and narrow this aggravating circumstance have\n   been unsuccessful. We have repeatedly rejected this claim.\n   <em>\n    Martinez v.

Appellant admitted to Dr. Grundy that he attacked Henry at the soda fountain. He struck Henry and strangled her with a choke-hold. Appellant also admitted to attacking Henry a second time on the floor in the stockroom of the store.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   \u00b6118 The evidence at trial revealed that Henry suffered serious physical abuse. Appellant subjected the teenager to a prolonged, brutal, and relentless attack. Appellant beat Henry so severely with his hands that they were demonstrably swollen to the law enforcement officers who came into contact with him after his arrest. The medical examiner, Dr. Inas Yacoub, testified that\n   Henry had extensive blunt force trauma to her head, face, scalp, neck, back and upper torso. The trauma was so significant that Henry had bruising behind her sternum and bleeding in the lining of her airways. She had suffered a traumatic brain injury from the trauma to her head. Yacoub indicated that the numerous injuries could not be explained by a single impact.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   \u00b6119 Yacoub testified that Henry also had bruises on her legs, arms, and hands. Sufficient pressure had been applied to Henry's neck to cause the fracture of the cricoid cartilage and petechiae in both eyes. Henry also had pattern injuries on her head, neck, arm, and upper back which were consistent with the bottom of Appellant's shoes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   \u00b6120 Based on the extensive injuries from the beating, any rational juror would also have recognized that Henry would have been under extreme mental anguish and emotional fear as she realized she was being beaten to death, one of the most agonizing ways a person can die. In addition, Dr. Yacoub's testimony suggested that Henry fought back in an effort to save her own life. Yacoub testified that Appellant had a bruise on his elbow and a bite mark where Henry had fought back. Yacoub noted that the bruises on Henry's right forearm were defensive in nature. Henry had numerous abrasions and a broken toe nail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   \u00b6121 Although Dr. Yacoub could not determine at what exact point Henry became unconscious, she did not see any evidence that Henry was immediately rendered unconscious. She explained that the pattern injury depicted in State's Exhibit Number 504 where Appellant had apparently stomped on Henry's throat occurred, as with the great majority of the other injuries, while Henry was still alive. She detailed that Henry had injuries to both the inside and outside of her head consistent with her having been dragged across the floor while still alive and conscious. Yacoub related that the blood on Henry's face indicated that Henry was conscious after Appellant's attack on her torso and coughed out blood from her nose and mouth. She stated that Henry breathed in her own blood and had suffered the painful experience of air hunger as she tried to breathe but could not get air into her fluid filled lungs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   \u00b6122 The photographs of Henry's injuries and the clothing that Appellant wore on the night of her death thoroughly corroborated Dr. Yacoub's account. Appellant did not present any evidence to contravene the State's evidence. Therefore, we conclude that, taking the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution in the present case, we find that any rational trier of fact could have found that Henry's murder was especially heinous, atrocious or cruel beyond a reasonable doubt.

Inst. Nos. 8-32, 8-33, OUJI-CR(2d) (Supp.2014). In the initial part of closing argument, the prosecutor directed the jury to the trial court's instruction and correctly paraphrased the uniform jury instruction concerning Appellant's burden of proof. She accurately stated that Appellant had the burden of raising a reasonable doubt as to his sanity but that if he raised such a doubt, the State had the overall burden of\n   proving sanity beyond a reasonable doubt. Defense counsel then directed the jury to the trial court's instruction and argued that the State had to prove that Appellant was sane because Appellant had raised a reasonable doubt as to his sanity. In rebuttal the second prosecutor, again, directed the jury to the trial court's instruction and correctly stated that Appellant was presumed sane and had the burden to prove that he was not sane. However, he mistakenly stated that Appellant's burden was \"beyond a reasonable doubt.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   It is apparent from these facts that the prosecutor's comment was not a blatant attempt to misstate the burden of proof. As the prosecutor correctly stated the burdens in her initial argument, defense counsel correctly stated the State's burden, and the trial court adequately instructed the jury on the issue, we find that the error was not plain or obvious in this instance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   \u00b6130 Third, Appellant claims that the prosecutor improperly bolstered the testimony of Dr. Hall with hearsay. He does not challenge Hall's reliance or relation of the hearsay at trial but, instead, argues that the prosecutor improperly used the evidence during closing argument to argue that Appellant was deceptive to his own attorneys.

The prosecutor did not argue that Appellant had been deceptive to his own attorneys. Instead, the prosecutor properly summarized Hall's testimony concerning jailer Dallas Cowen's observation that Appellant's \"behavior changed\" \"when the doctors and the lawyers showed up in the jail.\" The prosecutor's comment \"still in that planning stage\" suggesting that Appellant had planned his insanity defense from the very beginning of the offense was a reasonable inference based upon the evidence at trial. As the prosecutor's comments fell within the wide latitude afforded counsel during closing argument, we find that Appellant has not shown that error, plain or otherwise, occurred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   \u00b6132 Fourth, Appellant argues that the prosecutor argued facts not in evidence when discussing the cash register receipt from the Teepee Totem. As Appellant failed to raise this challenge at trial, we find that he has waived appellate review of this issue for all but plain error, and review the claim for plain error pursuant to the test set forth in\n   <em>\n    Simpson\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Malone\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6975753\" index=\"348\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/293/198/\">\n    2013 OK CR 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 40,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6975753\" index=\"349\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/293/198/\">\n    293 P.3d at 211\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   \u00b6133 Appellant introduced the cash register receipts from the Teepee Totem for the shift which he worked on the night of Henry's murder. The receipts illustrated that Appellant had used unconventional mathematics, somewhat similar to common core math, to calculate sales that evening. In closing argument, defense counsel asserted that the receipts evinced Appellant's psychotic break and insanity at the time of the offense. The prosecutor countered in rebuttal stating; \"How many of you have been a clerk? How many of you have been bored out of your minds and decided to do something while you were sitting there? I have ran a business in the past, and I have seen clerks do stuff like that.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   \u00b6134 The prosecutor's request that the jurors use their own experience in assessing whether the odd entries were indicative of boredom or a psychotic break was entirely proper.

Tammy Wilkerson was the first person to discover the pool of blood in the storeroom of the Teepee Totem. She testified that she observed that the floor was a little wet near the fountain drink dispenser. Wilkerson unmistakably hesitated when defense counsel on cross-examination attempted to secure her affirmation that this was to be expected around a soda fountain. Deputy Michael Moore testified that he observed droplets of blood leading from the storeroom, through the store and out to the front doors. He further observed a utility sink, mop, and a mop bucket in the storeroom. Both Wilkerson and Moore testified that they observed a cup of ice with a clear liquid in it on the counter next to the soda dispenser. Based upon this evidence, we find that the prosecutor did not misstate the evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   \u00b6139 It appears that the prosecutor made a minor misstatement of fact when he recounted Stanley Bench's testimony in closing argument. Bench did not testify that Appellant stated; \"Good-bye, Grandpa. I love you. Don't get hurt.\" Instead, Bench indicated that when Appellant declared, \"Pa, I love you,\" Bench had replied, \"I do you, too. Be careful out there and don't get hurt.\" Reviewing the totality of the evidence, we find that this minor misstatement did not constitute plain error. Appellant was not prejudiced by the misstatement, and thus it did not affect his substantial rights. We conclude that plain error did not occur.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   \u00b6140 Sixth, Appellant argues that the prosecutor improperly impeached his mother, Dana Huff, during the second stage of the trial. He, first, claims that the prosecutor used a \"mix-up\" about her violation of the rule of sequestration to portray Huff as a liar and then imputed this circumstance to the remainder of her testimony. Appellant failed to raise this specific challenge before the trial court, therefore, we find that he has waived appellate review of this issue for all but plain error, and review the claim for plain error pursuant to the test set forth in\n   <em>\n    Simpson\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Malone\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6975753\" index=\"365\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/293/198/\">\n    2013 OK CR 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 40,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6975753\" index=\"366\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/293/198/\">\n    293 P.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   211 ;\n   <em>\n    Harmon v.

We further note that generally, the State is permitted to cross-examine the defendant's witnesses at trial concerning any matter which is responsive to testimony given on direct examination or which is material or relevant thereto and which tends to elucidate, modify, explain, contradict or rebut testimony given in chief by the witness.\n   <em>\n    Malone\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6975753\" index=\"373\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/293/198/\">\n    2013 OK CR 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 45,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6975753\" index=\"374\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/293/198/\">\n    293 P.3d at 212\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   \u00b6142 Reviewing the record, we find that there was no \"mix-up.\" Defense counsel invoked the rule of sequestration immediately prior to opening statements in the first stage of the trial. When defense counsel called Appellant's mother to testify, the State approached and alleged a violation of the rule. During the\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   hearing held on this issue, Huff admitted to violating the rule and speaking to her husband about his testimony after he had testified, as well as speaking to another listed witness about his expected testimony. Acknowledging this fact, defense counsel suggested that cross-examination as to credibility was the proper remedy instead of exclusion of Huff's testimony. Huff testified in Appellant's defense. On cross-examination, she very reluctantly admitted to violating the rule. As Huff clearly violated the rule of sequestration, we find that the prosecutor properly impeached her with this fact.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   \u00b6143 Second, Appellant argues that the State impermissibly implied that Mrs. Huff lied during her son's enlistment with the Navy. Dr. Grundy admitted during his testimony that contrary to their statements to him both Appellant and Mrs. Huff had certified that Appellant did not have any educational, medical, psychiatric, psychological, emotional or mental health problems on his enlistment forms with the Navy. They further certified that Appellant did not have trouble sleeping and had never attempted suicide. Huff testified and acknowledged Appellant's educational, medical, emotional, and mental health problems as he was growing up. She claimed that Appellant had always had trouble sleeping and focused on harming himself during the time that he was on medication to help his inability to focus. When the prosecutor confronted Huff with her lie to the Federal Government, Huff was evasive and refused to acknowledge her untruthfulness. She claimed that she did not remember the Navy asking her about Appellant's educational history and only admitted to lying about Appellant's bouts of sleeplessness if they had, in fact, asked that question. She explained her denial of Appellant's psychiatric history explaining that she did not feel that Appellant had any psychiatric issues before joining the Navy. Ultimately, she admitted to presenting a falsehood to the officer that investigated the domestic violence incident between Appellant and Farlan Huff. She further admitted that she had run interference for Appellant his whole life. As the prosecutor's questions to Huff tended to contradict or rebut her testimony given on direct, we find that Appellant has not shown that an error, plain or otherwise, occurred. The prosecutor's cross-examination was proper.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-165\">\n   \u00b6144 Finally, Appellant argues that the prosecutor improperly invoked sympathy for the victim during second stage closing argument. Appellant failed to raise this specific challenge before the trial court, therefore, we find that he has waived appellate review of this issue for all but plain error, and review the claim for plain error pursuant to the test set forth in\n   <em>\n    Simpson\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Malone\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6975753\" index=\"375\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/293/198/\">\n    2013 OK CR 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 40,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6975753\" index=\"376\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/293/198/\">\n    293 P.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   211 ;\n   <em>\n    Harmon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6990679\" index=\"377\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/248/918/\">\n    2011 OK CR 6\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 36,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6990679\" index=\"378\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/248/918/\">\n    248 P.3d at 934\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-166\">\n   \u00b6145 This Court has consistently held it is improper for the prosecution to attempt to elicit sympathy for victims.\n   <em>\n    Garrison v.

Although the prosecutor's comment placed importance on focusing on the trial at hand, her personal observations were irrelevant and the comment had the potential to invoke sympathy. However, we do not find that the prosecutor's self-absorbed statement constituted plain error. Appellant claims that the prosecutor asked the jurors to imagine their daughters and nieces in Henry's circumstances. Although we have cautioned prosecutors against encouraging jurors to imagine themselves as the victim during the offense, we have concluded that these types of comments do not constitute plain error.\n   <em>\n    Browning v.

Taking the prosecutor's comments in context, we find that Appellant's claim is not supported by the record. The prosecutor did not ask the jurors to imagine their daughters and nieces in Henry's circumstances. Instead, while comparing the diverse responses of the differently aged women to Appellant's aggressive sexual behavior, the prosecutor asked the jurors if Appellant's unwelcome physical contact with several of the young female witnesses would be a \"big deal\" if it had occurred to their daughter or niece. As the prosecutor did not ask the jurors in the present case to place either themselves or their relatives in the victim's circumstances, we find that plain error did not occur.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-169\">\n   \u00b6147 Appellant also claims that the prosecutor invoked sympathy for Henry when he asked the jurors to listen for a voice that was no longer there during the rebuttal portion of the State's closing argument.

During second stage closing argument the prosecutor compared the in-life photo with a post-mortem photo depicting the injuries to Henry's head, face, neck, and shoulders. The prosecutor stated that one image reflected Henry before Appellant's attack and the other image reflected her appearance after Appellant was done with her.

During second stage closing argument the prosecutor compared the in-life photo with a photo of Henry's body shortly after it was discovered. The post-mortem photo depicted the injuries to Henry's head, face, neck, and shoulders. Comparison of these two photos was the only means to grasp the true extent of Henry's injuries and the nature of Appellant's crime. As the contrasting images tended to establish both serious physical abuse and the calloused nature of Appellant, the photos held great probative value concerning the State's alleged aggravating circumstances. Giving the in-life photo its maximum reasonable probative force and its minimum reasonable prejudicial value, we find that the photo's probative value was not substantially outweighed by its prejudicial effect.\n   <em>\n    Mayes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"402\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1994%20OK%20CR%2044\">\n    1994 OK CR 44\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 77,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10352061\" index=\"403\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/887/1288/#p1310\">\n    887 P.2d at 1310\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

We determined in that Proposition that Appellant had not shown that Dr. Terese Hall's testimony constituted plain error. As such, we find that Appellant has not shown ineffective assistance of counsel under\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8313879\" index=\"419\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/157/143/\">\n    2007 OK CR 12\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 112, 157 P.3d at 161.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-185\">\n   \u00b6161 Third, Appellant claims that counsel was ineffective for failing to impeach Dr. Hall's testimony. He argues that counsel should have impeached Hall with Clayton Jenson's trial testimony. Solely citing Jenson's testimony for the defense, Appellant asserts that defense counsel could have undercut Dr. Hall's testimony by questioning her concerning Jenson's statements. Taking Jenson's testimony in the full context of the trial, we find that Appellant has not shown that counsel's conduct fell outside the wide range of reasonable professional assistance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-186\">\n   \u00b6162 Appellant's cousin, Clayton Jenson, testified for both the State and the defense at trial. Although Jenson extrapolated on his statements as the trial went on, his account remained consistent. Jenson testified in the State's case-in-chief that he regularly spoke with Appellant and spent approximately 2 hours with Appellant on the day of Henry's murder. He indicated that Appellant was able to engage him in meaningful conversation and they discussed their future plans together that day. Although Appellant had previously voiced concerns that other people might think he was different or crazy, Jenson did not see any sign of these things. Jenson testified that he did not see anything wrong with Appellant on the day of Henry's death.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-187\">\n   \u00b6163 Jenson expounded on Appellant's concerns while testifying in Appellant's defense. He recounted that Appellant had talked about things bothering him in his room, like a demon. Appellant had also stated that a man and a woman were hunting him, trying to find him and kill him, because he knew too much from what he had done in the military. He had claimed that he had a chip in his brain like a universal soldier science project and proclaimed that he was afraid of going to the doctor for fear that he would be committed. Jenson advised that Appellant has stated that he had gone days without sleeping.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-188\">\n   \u00b6164 On cross-examination, Jenson affirmed that he did not believe that there was anything wrong with Appellant during the two weeks preceding Henry's death. He explained that he did not believe Appellant's\n   statements at that time. Jenson related that Appellant was clean and had good hygiene. He had meaningful conversations with Jenson. He was rational during these conversations and Jenson did not see anything to indicate that Appellant had any problem. Jenson testified that, consistent with his former testimony, he still did not believe that there was anything wrong with Appellant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-189\">\n   \u00b6165 On redirect, defense counsel secured Jenson's affirmation that he did not want to believe Appellant's statements at the time. Jenson also affirmed that he had just blown Appellant off because he did not want to hear it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-190\">\n   \u00b6166 Dr. Hall testified in rebuttal for the State. She indicated she relied upon information from Jenson in forming her opinion that Appellant was sane at the time of Henry's murder. Hall observed that Jenson's statements to her two years after Henry's death were consistent with his initial statements. Jenson reported that Appellant and he were about the same age and spent quite a bit of time together, including on the day of the offense. Jenson did not see anything wrong with Appellant and believed that he was normal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-191\">\n   \u00b6167 When defense counsel cross-examined Hall, he did not seek to impeach Hall with Jenson's testimony for the defense. However, we find that counsel's omission did not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel. As outlined above, Jenson's testimony remained consistent. He wholly acknowledged Appellant's claims but consistently maintained that he did not believe that Appellant had mental health problems based upon the fact that he did not see any signs to support Appellant's claims. Even after disclosing the nature and extent of Appellant's claims, Jenson explicitly testified that, consistent with his former testimony, he still did not believe that there was anything wrong with Appellant. Since Jenson's testimony in defense would not have undercut his statements to Hall or his testimony in the State's case-in-chief, we find that counsel's conduct fell within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-192\">\n   \u00b6168 Appellant also argues that counsel was ineffective for failing to impeach Dr. Hall with her testimony in another case. He cites to this Court's unpublished opinion in\n   <em>\n    Fears v. State\n   </em>\n   , F-2004-1279 (Okla. Cr., July 7, 2006) as evidencing Dr. Hall's testimony. However, Appellant has not provided any authority establishing that defense counsel would have been able to use this Court's unpublished opinion to impeach Dr. Hall. Although the author of\n   <em>\n    Fears\n   </em>\n   described certain statements from Dr. Hall's testimony in that case, this Court's opinion in\n   <em>\n    Fears\n   </em>\n   does not constitute Dr. Hall's prior testimony.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Roy v.

Dr. Hall's testimony from\n   <em>\n    Fears\n   </em>\n   is not within the record on appeal and Appellant has not sought to supplement the record with the official court reporter's transcripts from that trial. As such, we must conclude that Appellant has not shown that counsel's performance was constitutionally deficient.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-193\">\n   \u00b6169 Even if we were to consider the statements which Appellant recounts from\n   <em>\n    Fears\n   </em>\n   , we would find that it did not undermine Dr. Hall's testimony in the present case. Hall's testimony did not materially differ. To the contrary, the facts in\n   <em>\n    Fears\n   </em>\n   actually reveal that Hall's testimony remained consistent. The officers who arrested the defendant in\n   <em>\n    Fears\n   </em>\n   observed signs of mental illness in him and the defendant, himself, verbalized a delusion to one of the officers. These were the very circumstances which Dr. Hall cited as missing from Appellant's conversations with Clayton Jenson, Stanley Bench, Deputy Quinton Short, and Detention Officer Brown and which led her to conclude that Appellant had not suffered a psychotic break. Therefore, we are forced to conclude that Appellant has not shown that there is a reasonable probability that the outcome of the trial would have been different but for counsel's failure to use Hall's testimony from the\n   <em>\n    Fears\n   </em>\n   case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-194\">\n   \u00b6170 Appellant also argues that counsel should have impeached Dr. Hall with\n   the conclusions of Scott Orth, Ph.D. and Peter Rausch, Ph.D. of the Oklahoma Forensic Center. We note that Dr. Orth's competency report and Dr. Rausch's testimony from Appellant's competency trial were both filed of record in the case and are among the items which Dr. Hall reviewed in formulating her opinion at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-195\">\n   \u00b6171 Although this information was readily available to impeach Dr. Hall at trial, we are not convinced that the conclusions of Dr. Orth and Dr. Rausch were favorable to Appellant's defense because their observations and conclusions were more consistent with Dr. Hall's testimony than Appellant's own expert. Dr. Grundy testified that Appellant appeared psychotic when he visited him. Grundy did not find any evidence of malingering. He found that Appellant suffered active symptoms of mental illness, such as delusions and hallucinations, which caused him not to understand the legal wrongness of his behavior at the time of the offense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-196\">\n   \u00b6172 Dr. Orth's report contrasted with Grundy's findings. Orth clearly found evidence of either fabrication or feigning when he evaluated Appellant in February of 2013. Dr. Orth did not see any overt evidence of Appellant's self-proclaimed hallucinations or delusions and noted that Appellant gave \"vague and unusual responses regarding his experiences of psychiatric symptoms.\" Orth assessed Appellant with the MMPI-2 to determine whether Appellant was \"feigning psychopathology.\" He wrote in his report that the testing indicated that Appellant \"may have been responding to items in a manner to communicate that he is very psychologically disturbed when in fact that is not the case\" or \"he may have been responding to items in a manner to draw attention to negative characteristics, exaggerating his self-reported psychological symptoms as a plea for help.\" Orth did not conclusively determine whether Appellant was faking or exaggerating his symptoms. Instead, he wrote that it was his \"conservative opinion\" that it was more likely that Appellant had exaggerated his psychological symptoms as a plea for help. Ultimately, Orth determined that Appellant was not a person requiring treatment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-197\">\n   \u00b6173 Although Orth's \"conservative opinion\" did not exactly match Hall's conclusion that Appellant was malingering, overall Orth's report tended to corroborate Dr. Hall's testimony. Hall testified that Appellant's results on the two scales for assessing over-reporting or exaggeration on the MMPI-2 were extremely high. Appellant admits that the results of Dr. Orth's administration of the exam to Appellant were similar to the results which Dr. Hall obtained. Orth's report was consistent with Dr. Hall's explanation that she did not see any overt evidence of psychosis during her evaluation of Appellant. It also corroborated Hall's account that Appellant's report of delusions was very unusual.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-198\">\n   \u00b6174 As with Dr. Orth, we find that Dr. Rausch's testimony tended to corroborate Hall's observations and opinion. Dr. Rausch testified that he performed an outpatient evaluation with Appellant in March of 2014. The evaluation took place in an interview room over the course of approximately one hour. Rausch did not see any need to retest Appellant and simply relied upon his coworker, Dr. Orth's, prior testing of Appellant. Rausch indicated that he agreed with Orth's interpretation of Appellant's MMPI-2 testing. He indicated that the results revealed either that Appellant was \"feigning psychological symptoms and pathology\" or was endorsing a lot of symptoms and over-reporting as a cry for help. Rausch also testified that Appellant engaged in fairly unusual behavior during his evaluation. Dr. Rausch did not have any reason to dispute Orth's finding that Appellant did not have any substantial symptoms. Each of these findings was consistent with Dr. Hall's observations and tended to contradict Dr. Grundy's testimony. As such, we find that Appellant has not shown that counsel's performance fell outside the wide range of reasonable professional assistance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-199\">\n   \u00b6175 Similarly, Appellant has not shown prejudice from counsel's omission. The evidence at trial strongly indicated that Appellant was sane at the time of the offense. When Appellant enlisted in the Navy in November of 2011, his mother verified that he did not have any mental health issues. The Navy had a doctor examine Appellant and he\n   certified that Appellant did not have any psychiatric issues. After Appellant was discharged for going AWOL, his stepfather had him seen by a mental health professional on two separate occasions. Neither mental health professional determined that Appellant was a person requiring treatment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-200\">\n   \u00b6176 Appellant's actions on the day of the murder evinced his sanity. Neither Stanley Bench nor Clayton Jenson observed Appellant acting out of the ordinary that night. Appellant did not report any delusions to them. Appellant's behavior immediately after killing Henry appeared to be rational, goal-oriented action. He quickly attempted to conceal the crime by secreting Henry out of the store and hiding her body in a semi-secluded area near his home. Appellant attempted to escape from the State in Henry's car after washing himself and covering up his blood soaked clothes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-201\">\n   \u00b6177 Appellant acted coherent and rational when he later interacted with the law enforcement officials that night. He appeared lucid and normal to both Deputy Quinton Short and Detention Officer Kendall Brown. Dr. Grundy admitted that there was not any independent evidence to corroborate Appellant's claimed delusions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-202\">\n   \u00b6178 The audio tape of Appellant's conversation with Brown was convincing. Appellant did not relate any delusions during the conversation. He was self-directed and voluntarily initiated a discussion with Brown concerning the viability of an insanity defense. Appellant's comments illustrated his prior knowledge concerning psychological evaluations and feigning mental illness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-203\">\n   \u00b6179 The evidence also strongly suggested that Appellant was feigning mental illness. Although Appellant had passed Dr. Grundy's tests for malingering, Appellant's test results on the MMPI-2 tended to indicate that he was feigning or over-reporting symptoms. Appellant took two MMPI-2 tests. Both tests indicated that Appellant was feigning or over-reporting mental health symptoms. When Dr. Hall gave Appellant the MMPI-2 after Grundy's evaluation, the scores indicated that Appellant was exaggerating and over-reporting. Even Dr. Grundy had to admit that Appellant might not be the most truthful person in the world.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-204\">\n   \u00b6180 Dr. Hall did not see any evidence of severe psychosis in Appellant. At the time of trial, Appellant still maintained that he was not mentally ill. None of the seven separate mental health professionals who had evaluated Appellant found that he was a person requiring treatment. Only Dr. Grundy had diagnosed Appellant as insane on the night of the offense. Despite Grundy's belief that Appellant had schizophrenia and was psychotic when he first evaluated him, Appellant was able to appear at trial and participate in his defense without taking any medication for the condition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-205\">\n   \u00b6181 In light of the evidence of Appellant's sanity and feigning we conclude that the evidence would not have permitted the jury to find that Appellant was insane at the time of the offense. Accordingly, we find that Appellant has not shown a reasonable probability that the outcome of the trial would have been different had counsel attempted to impeach Dr. Hall with Dr. Orth's competency report and Dr. Rausch's testimony from the competency trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-206\">\n   \u00b6182 Fourth, Appellant asserts that counsel was ineffective because she wholly abandoned the theme that he was a severely mentally ill individual during the second stage of the trial. He alleges that this caused an unreasonable inconsistency between his first and second stage defenses. We find that Appellant's assertion is not supported by the record. Counsel emphasized Appellant's mental health issues during both stages of the trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-207\">\n   \u00b6183 Although counsel did not explicitly mention the term \"schizophrenia\" during the second stage, counsel presented testimony from several witnesses concerning Appellant's mental health. She introduced testimony from Naval Chief, Andre Southerland, who had overseen Appellant's training in boot camp. Chief Southerland had sent Appellant for a psychiatric evaluation during his extended time in boot camp. Counsel also called Appellant's best friend, Anthony Michael Popovich, to testify. Popovich interacted with Appellant while he was AWOL from the Navy and testified as to Appellant's mental\n   state during this time. Popovich related that Appellant appeared disturbed, acted paranoid, and informed him that he was working \"Special Ops\" doing top secret work for the Navy. Defense counsel introduced Rebecca Becker's testimony that Appellant appeared both disoriented and scared at the arraignment following his arrest for stealing a vehicle while AWOL. She also presented Farlan Huff's testimony concerning Appellant's mental health and his attempts to have Appellant admitted for treatment after he came home from the Navy. Counsel called Sharon Clements of Ada's Program of Assertive Community Treatment to explain why they were unable to help Appellant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-208\">\n   \u00b6184 Counsel's second stage closing argument emphasized that Appellant's mental health problems played a large role in his life and were mitigating. Thus, the record reflects that defense counsel presented a consistent defense across both stages of the trial centering upon a downturn in Appellant's mental health following his time in the Navy. As such, we find that Appellant has not shown that counsel's performance fell outside the wide range of reasonable professional assistance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-209\">\n   \u00b6185 Appellant also raises several claims of ineffective assistance of counsel predicated on circumstances outside the record. Simultaneous with the filing of his Brief, Appellant filed his Application for Evidentiary Hearing on Sixth Amendment Claim. Appellant seeks to supplement the record on appeal pursuant to both Rule 3.11(A) and 3.11(B),\n   <em>\n    Rules of the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals\n   </em>\n   , Title 22, Ch. 18, App. (2017) and requests an evidentiary hearing on his claims of ineffective assistance. We must address Appellant's application before we can determine his claims of ineffective assistance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-210\">\n   \u00b6186 This Court analyzes requests to supplement the record which are based upon ineffective assistance of counsel claims pursuant to Rule 3.11(B).\n   <em>\n    Day v.

We review and consider an appellant's application and affidavits along with other attached non-record evidence to determine whether the appellant has provided sufficient information to show this Court by clear and convincing evidence that there is a strong possibility trial counsel was ineffective for failing to utilize or identify the evidence at issue.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6993361\" index=\"434\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/230/888/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   This standard is less demanding than the test imposed by\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6993361\" index=\"435\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/230/888/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-213\">\n   \u00b6189 Reviewing Appellant's application under this standard, we find that he has not shown clear and convincing evidence that there is a strong possibility that counsel was ineffective for failing to identify or utilize the proffered evidence. Appellant asserts in his application that counsel was ineffective for failing to effectively cross-examine his co-worker at the Teepee Totem, Melissa Lynn. Arguing that Lynn's testimony at trial was in direct conflict with her statement to the police,\n   Appellant refers us to Exhibit \"1\" to his application. This exhibit appears to be a copy of the DVD recording of Lynn's statement to Law Enforcement. Lynn's statements to the investigating officer in Exhibit \"1\" substantially conformed to her testimony at trial. The only exception was that Lynn informed the investigating officer that Appellant was slow and was not catching on. She explained that part of the reason that Appellant was slow was because he was young and liked to flirt with every girl that came into the store.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-214\">\n   \u00b6190 It appears that the State provided Exhibit \"1\" to the defense prior to trial. Comparing Lynn's testimony at trial with Exhibit \"1\" we find that Lynn's testimony was not false or misleading. Although defense counsel did not impeach Lynn with her prior statement that Appellant was slow and was not catching on, we find that Appellant has not shown that defense counsel's decision could not be considered sound trial strategy. Since Lynn partly attributed Appellant's slowness to the fact that he was young and liked to flirt with every girl that came into the store, we find that it was reasonable for counsel to omit this impeachment evidence. Delving into this topic with Lynn had the potential to undercut the defense's other evidence that Appellant was actually slow. Clearly, the defense wanted to avoid portraying Appellant as having approached other young females in the store.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-215\">\n   \u00b6191 We further find that Appellant has not shown that there is a reasonable probability that the outcome of the trial would have been different had defense counsel impeached Lynn. We note that defense counsel presented the testimony of several teachers and neighbors from Appellant's childhood. These individuals testified that Appellant had a learning disability and was in special education classes as he grew up. Counsel also presented Chief Southerland's testimony that Appellant required extra attention and did not do well in boot camp because he was slow and could not complete more than a 3 step process. Southerland sent Appellant to the Navy's special program which was akin to special education; however, it was apparent that Appellant was not going to complete boot camp even before he went AWOL. This testimony more than subsumed the evidence which Appellant contends defense counsel should have introduced. Accordingly, we find that Appellant has not shown clear and convincing evidence of a strong possibility that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to impeach Lynn with the proffered evidence.\n   <em>\n    Simpson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6993361\" index=\"436\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/230/888/\">\n    2010 OK CR 6\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 53,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6993361\" index=\"437\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/230/888/\">\n    230 P.3d at 905-906\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-216\">\n   \u00b6192 Appellant further asserts in his application that counsel was ineffective for failing to impeach Lynn with the civil lawsuit which Henry's family filed against Appellant, the Teepee Totem, and its owners. He refers us to Exhibit \"2\" to his application. This exhibit appears to be a copy of a Petition alleging that Appellant, the Teepee Totem, and its owners we liable for the wrongful death of Henry. Lynn is not mentioned in the alleged petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-217\">\n   \u00b6193 Appellant has not provided any authority establishing that defense counsel would have been able to use this lawsuit to impeach Lynn. As Appellant has failed to establish that counsel's performance was constitutionally deficient, we, again, find that Appellant has not shown clear and convincing evidence of a strong possibility that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to utilize or identify the proffered evidence.\n   <em>\n    Simpson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6993361\" index=\"438\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/230/888/\">\n    2010 OK CR 6\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 53,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6993361\" index=\"439\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/230/888/\">\n    230 P.3d at 905-906\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-218\">\n   \u00b6194 Appellant further asserts in his application that counsel was ineffective for failing to challenge Dr. Hall's opinion that he was \"malingering\" or \"faking\" mental illness and her suggestion that it was easy to fool the Structured Interview of Reported Symptoms (\"SIRS\"). Appellant argues that counsel should have called Dr. Grundy to testify in surrebuttal and impeach Dr. Hall's testimony on these points. He refers us to Exhibit \"4\" to his application. This exhibit is the affidavit of Dr. Curtis Grundy, Appellant's psychological expert from trial. The affidavit alleges that Dr. Grundy consulted with the defense team after Dr. Hall's testimony and informed them that he would not recommend his testifying in surrebuttal. Now, in hindsight, Grundy believes that if he had testified he could have challenged Dr. Hall's testimony suggesting that Appellant was \"malingering\" or \"faking.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-219\">\n   \u00b6195 We refuse to review counsel's performance in the lens of hindsight.\n   <em>\n    Robinson v.

Defense counsel's apparent reliance upon Dr. Grundy's expertise in determining whether to call him in surrebuttal was a strategic decision. That Grundy and appellate counsel have now imagined ways to impeach Dr. Hall is not persuasive.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hancock\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8327828\" index=\"442\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/155/796/\">\n    2007 OK CR 9\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 113,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8327828\" index=\"443\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/155/796/\">\n    155 P.3d at 822\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Imaginative criticisms of trial counsel's performance issue all too readily from the gainful vantage of a zealous hindsight.\")\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-220\">\n   \u00b6196 We further find that Appellant has not shown a reasonable probability that the outcome of the trial would have been different had counsel called Grundy in surrebuttal. Grundy's testimony at trial concerning \"malingering\" and \"faking\" was consistent with Dr. Hall's trial testimony. Dr. Grundy recounted that he gave Appellant two different tests to determine if he was malingering. One of the tests assessed \"feigning or fabricating symptoms of mental illness\" and the other test assessed \"whether someone is trying to feign or fake memory impairment.\" Dr. Grundy agreed that equating malingering with \"faking\" was a lay-person's way of viewing it. On cross-examination, Grundy admitted that Appellant was not the most truthful person. Accordingly, we find that Appellant has not shown clear and convincing evidence of a strong possibility that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to call Dr. Grundy in surrebuttal.\n   <em>\n    Simpson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6993361\" index=\"444\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/230/888/\">\n    2010 OK CR 6\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 53,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6993361\" index=\"445\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/230/888/\">\n    230 P.3d at 905-906\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-221\">\n   \u00b6197 Appellant further asserts in his application that counsel was ineffective for failing to present the testimony of a mitigation specialist in the second stage of the trial. He refers us to Exhibit \"3\" of his application. This exhibit is the affidavit of David Musick, Ph.D., a retired sociologist from the University of Northern Colorado, who claims to be a mitigation specialist. Dr. Musick alleges that he was retained to construct a social history in Appellant's case; reviewed all of the material which counsel sent him; interviewed Appellant, his mother, and half-brother; prepared a report; appeared at Appellant's trial to testify; but defense counsel did not call him to testify because he did not want the jury to hear 4 lines of information contained in his report. Attachment \"B\" to Musick's affidavit is his self-styled original report.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   The ostensible language from Musick's report professes that Appellant had told his grandmother that young customers at the convenience store had called him cruel names.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   It further denoted that the last thought of Appellant's mother was that Appellant might have reached his limit after taking years and years of abuse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-222\">\n   \u00b6198 Despite Musick's acknowledgment of counsel's reason for not calling him as a witness at trial, Appellant asserts that Musick's testimony was necessary to explain and personalize the other mitigation evidence which counsel presented.

He has neither argued nor shown that counsel's strategic decision to not call Musick as a witness to avoid his being questioned about the 4 lines was objectively unreasonable. We note that these 4 lines were inconsistent with Appellant's first stage defense. We cannot fault counsel for maintaining a consistent defense through\n   both stages of the trial.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Taylor v.

Counsel presented the great majority of the information contained in Dr. Musick's affidavit and Report through the testimony of the numerous witnesses that counsel called during the second stage of the trial. Therefore, much of Musick's testimony would have been cumulative and not likely to have had an immense effect on the jury. At the same time, certain of Dr. Musick's conclusions could be considered detrimental to Appellant's case in mitigation. Musick's conclusion that Appellant killed Henry as a reaction to years and years of bullying was not so compelling as to have shifted the jury's weighing of the evidence in aggravation and mitigation. Nothing in the record suggests that Henry bullied or spoke harshly to Appellant on the night of her death. That Appellant allegedly took out the accumulated pain of years of bullying on an innocent young female that ventured into the store where he was working tends to support the State's theory that Appellant posed a continuing threat to society.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-225\">\n   \u00b6201 We also note that Musick's concluding paragraph in his Report speculated that Appellant could continue to engage in impulsive behavior, lack empathy, and be aggressive in the future if his head injuries were left untreated. This information also would have likely tended to support the State's allegation that Appellant posed a continuing threat to society. As the great majority of Musick's information was actually presented to the jury and his ultimate conclusions might have actually supported the State's case, we find that Appellant has not shown a strong possibility that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to utilize or identify the proffered evidence.\n   <em>\n    Simpson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6993361\" index=\"459\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/230/888/\">\n    2010 OK CR 6\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 53,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6993361\" index=\"460\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/230/888/\">\n    230 P.3d at 905-906\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-226\">\n   \u00b6202 Appellant further asserts in his application that counsel was ineffective for failing to present the testimony of a mental health expert in the second stage of the trial. He, again, refers us to Exhibit \"4,\" the affidavit of Dr. Curtis Grundy. In his untested and unproven affidavit, Dr. Grundy alleges that he could have testified in the second stage of the trial that Appellant met the criteria for diagnosis of schizophrenia. He further alleges that schizophrenia is a severe mental illness that requires ongoing treatment and that he could have testified as to how this condition impaired Appellant's functioning.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-227\">\n   \u00b6203 Grundy's proffered statements are cumulative to the testimony he actually gave in the first stage of the trial. Grundy testified that he had diagnosed Appellant as suffering from schizophrenia. He explained that this accounted for his bizarre behavior after his discharge from the Navy, including his hallucinations, delusions, grandiose ideas, paranoia, odd statements to others, and boundary issues,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , failure to comply with notions of personal space. Although wholly unnecessary, defense counsel explicitly moved to introduce all of the defense's evidence from the first stage of the trial into evidence in the second stage of the trial.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   21 O.S.2011, \u00a7 701.10a (providing that \"all exhibits and a transcript of all testimony and other evidence properly admitted in the prior trial and sentencing shall be admissible in [a] new sentencing proceeding.\"). Thus, the jury was free to consider Grundy's first stage testimony and there was no reason for defense counsel to call Grundy in the second stage of the trial. We, again, find that Appellant has not shown clear and convincing evidence of a strong possibility that counsel was ineffective for failing to utilize or identify the proffered evidence.\n   <em>\n    Simpson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6993361\" index=\"461\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/230/888/\">\n    2010 OK CR 6\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 53,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6993361\" index=\"462\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/230/888/\">\n    230 P.3d at 905-906\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-228\">\n   \u00b6204 Appellant further asserts in his application that counsel was ineffective for failing to investigate and present neuro-imaging evidence in both stages of the trial. He cites to two different exhibits to his application in support of this claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-229\">\n   \u00b6205 Appellant refers us to Exhibit \"5\" to his application for evidentiary hearing. This exhibit is the affidavit of William Werner\n   Orrison, M.D., the Chief of Neuroradiology at Simon Med Imaging Centers in Las Vegas, New Mexico. Dr. Orrison asserts that he received the MRI data from Appellant's evaluation at the University of Oklahoma Medical Center. He alleges that Appellant has anomalies in four different areas of his brain but does not relate those anomalies to Appellant's behavior in any way. Dr. Orrison does not directly correlate these alleged anomalies with any mental defect disorder, disease, condition or illness. He has not set forth any diagnosis of Appellant. Instead, Dr. Orrison simply relates the problems which can result if a patient has an anatomical abnormality in the specified areas of the brain.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-230\">\n   \u00b6206 Appellant further refers us to Exhibit \"6\" to his application for evidentiary hearing. This exhibit is the affidavit of Jason Paulus Kerkmans, J.D., the Associate Director of MINDSET. Mr. Kerkmans asserts that MINDSET's protocol exam is sufficient to identify a wide range of structural brain abnormalities or deviations which may be of behavioral and clinical significance. He further asserts that additional imaging is necessary because Appellant's current MRI imaging data is not adequate to permit the full MINDSET protocol.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-231\">\n   \u00b6207 We find that Appellant has not established prejudice from counsel's omission to present neuro-imaging evidence at trial. The courts have not accepted diagnosis of psychological conditions through neuro-imaging as sufficiently reliable to be admissible under the\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   standard.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Jason P.

Thus, the proffered neuro-imaging evidence would have been cumulative to the other evidence in Appellant's defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-232\">\n   \u00b6208 As more fully discussed, above, the evidence at trial strongly indicated that Appellant was feigning a severe mental illness. Appellant evinced knowledge of both mental illness and feigning during his impromptu discussion with Officer Brown in the jail. He did not appear to be hallucinating or suffering from delusions immediately after the offense. Multiple psychologists had come to the conclusion that Appellant was over-reporting or feigning mental illness. We are not persuaded that the neuro-imaging evidence would have been able to overcome the compelling evidence of Appellant's sanity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-233\">\n   \u00b6209 We further find that Appellant has not shown prejudice from counsel's omission to present the proffered neuro-imaging evidence in the second stage of the trial. Reweighing the evidence in aggravation against both the mitigating evidence which was presented and the proffered neuro-imaging, we find that Appellant has not shown a reasonable probability that had counsel presented the neuro-imaging evidence the jury would have concluded that the balance of aggravating and mitigating circumstances did not\n   warrant death.\n   <em>\n    Williams v. Taylor\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9508607\" index=\"470\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/529/362/#p397\">\n    529 U.S. 362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 397-98,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9508607\" index=\"471\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/529/362/#p397\">\n    120 S.Ct. 1495\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1515,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9508607\" index=\"472\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/529/362/#p397\">\n    146 L.Ed.2d 389\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2000) ;\n   <em>\n    Goode v.

Counsel's omission to present the proffered evidence did not prevent the jury from considering any additional circumstance in mitigation because the neuro-imaging evidence was cumulative to Appellant's other mitigating evidence. The jury was instructed that they were able to consider Appellant's learning disability, the influence of his mental disturbance, his limitation in capacity to appreciate the criminality of his conduct, and his inability to conform his behavior to the requirements of the law among other potential mitigating circumstances. Since the proffered neuro-imaging evidence does not readily correlate to whether Appellant knew right from wrong, maintained criminal intent or suffered from schizophrenia we find that it did not corroborate Dr. Grundy's diagnosis of schizophrenia more adequately than the eyewitness accounts which defense counsel presented. Likewise, the proffered evidence would not have been sufficient to overcome the strong evidence that Appellant had feigned a severe mental illness. The jurors were able to assess Appellant's mental functioning for themselves by listening to his recorded conversation with Detention Officer Kendall Brown.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-235\">\n   \u00b6211 The proffered neuro-imaging evidence would not have been sufficient to overcome the State's evidence. As discussed above, the evidence establishing the aggravating circumstances of the murder was compelling. The great weight of the evidence showed that Henry endured conscious physical suffering and severe emotional trauma before dying. Appellant's behavior displayed a pattern of escalating criminal activity and violence. Coupled with the calloused nature of the offense, there was a clear probability that Appellant would continue to constitute a threat to society. Therefore, we conclude that Appellant has not shown clear and convincing evidence of a strong possibility that counsel was ineffective for failing to present neuro-imaging evidence.\n   <em>\n    Simpson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6993361\" index=\"475\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/230/888/\">\n    2010 OK CR 6\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 53,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6993361\" index=\"476\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/230/888/\">\n    230 P.3d at 905-906\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-236\">\n   \u00b6212 Appellant further asserts in his application that counsel was ineffective for failing to present testimony from his mother and grandmother documenting poignant stories and photographs from his life. He cites to two different exhibits to his application in support of this claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-237\">\n   \u00b6213 Appellant refers us to Exhibit \"7\" to his application. This exhibit is the affidavit of his mother, Dana Huff. In the affidavit, Mrs. Huff alleges that had counsel asked her, she would have testified that Appellant's life had value. She would have informed the jury that she loved Appellant and that he loved his siblings. She further alleges that she supplied Appellant's defense team with stories from Appellant's life as well as the 10 photographs attached to her affidavit. Mrs. Huff further alleges that she has sympathy for the victim's family and knows their grief because she had also lost a child.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-238\">\n   \u00b6214 Appellant further refers us to Exhibit \"8\" to his application. This exhibit is the affidavit of his grandmother, Albertha Bench. In the affidavit, Mrs. Bench alleges that had defense counsel called her testify in the second stage of the trial, she would have testified as to her love for Appellant and explained that he had never scared her. She further alleges that she gave defense counsel the photograph attached to her affidavit which depicted Appellant in his Navy uniform prior to trial. Mrs. Bench further alleges that she has sympathy for the victim's family and knows their grief because she had also lost a child.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-239\">\n   \u00b6215 Turning to the record, we find that the jury was not deprived of evidence showing that Appellant was a beloved and loving son, grandson and brother. Instead, it is quite clear from the record that Appellant's family loved him. His grandfather, Stanley Bench, testified in the first stage of the trial as to the exchange which occurred when Appellant declared that he was leaving his grandparents' home. Mr. Bench related that Mrs. Bench did not want Appellant to leave so he had advised Appellant; \"You better get on out of her because when your grandma comes back, she is liable to have a heart\n   attack.\" Appellant replied; \"Yes, I know.\" Mr. Bench also testified as to their departing words. Appellant declared; \"Pa, I love you.\" Mr. Bench responded; \"I do you too. Be careful out there and don't get hurt.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-240\">\n   \u00b6216 Albertha Bench verified Mr. Bench's profession that she loved Appellant when she testified in the first stage of the trial. Mrs. Bench related how she had attempted to care for Appellant. She explained that she had tried to help him overcome strep throat and attempted to assuage his mental health issues while he was living with her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-241\">\n   \u00b6217 Appellant's stepfather, Farlan Huff, testified in the second stage of the trial. Mr. Huff's testimony tended to show how Appellant's family loved him and he loved his family. Mr. Huff related that he had raised Appellant from the age of one-year as if he was his own son. Huff had potty-trained Appellant and taught him how to drive. Mr. Huff also explained that Appellant had sobbed after Mrs. Huff ordered him to stop his violent attack on Mr. Huff. He further related that he had refused to press charges against Appellant because he did not want to split the family up. Mr. Huff made it clear that he still considered himself as Appellant's father.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-242\">\n   \u00b6218 Similarly, Dana Huff's testimony in the second stage of the trial made it unmistakably clear that she loved Appellant and wanted him to go on living. She related how she had tried to care for Appellant his entire life. Mrs. Huff testified that she was always proud of her son. She testified concerning Appellant's brother and explained that Appellant had not taken it well when his sister died. While admitting that she was \"running interference\" for Appellant, Mrs. Huff declared; \"He is my child, and I would like to save him.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-243\">\n   \u00b6219 We further note that counsel presented other evidence that humanized Appellant. Mrs. Huff testified that Appellant had made friends with an elderly man in a nursing home when he was a teenager. Since his family had abandoned him in the home, Appellant became a companion to the man, went on walks, and shared many conversations with him. Counsel also presented the testimony of Jackie Plese, Appellant's third grade special education teacher. Ms. Plese informed the jury that she had continued to correspond with Appellant while he was in the jail. She regularly sent him Bible passages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-244\">\n   \u00b6220 We further find that the proffered evidence would have undercut counsel's overall second stage strategy of emphasizing the upheaval and dysfunction in his childhood. It appears that counsel had identified and investigated the proffered testimony and photographs. Instead of introducing this evidence at trial, counsel presented evidence tending to show that Appellant was a quiet and sad child who was mistreated both at school and at home because of his learning disability and obsessive compulsive issues. Counsel portrayed Appellant's childhood home as dysfunctional and subject to numerous incidents of upheaval. Since testimony establishing that Appellant had a normal and happy childhood would have undercut the defense's claims of mistreatment and dysfunction, it is clear that counsel made a choice between these two avenues of evidence. As Appellant has neither argued nor shown why counsel's chosen avenue was unreasonable, we find that he has failed to overcome the presumption that counsel's omission of the evidence was an objectively reasonable strategic decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-245\">\n   \u00b6221 Appellant's allegation that defense counsel should have presented the declarations of Mrs. Huff and Mrs. Bench that each of them had sympathy for the victim's family and knew their grief because each had also lost a child is not well received. As these were the declarations of Appellant's family members, we fail to see how they would have humanized Appellant. Additionally, these declarations were not favorable to Appellant's defense. Every individual's grief over the loss of a loved one is unique and different. Certainly, the grief of Henry's family was different than the grief which Appellant's family members had suffered. Counsel's decision to omit such testimony was more than objectively reasonable. Accordingly, we find that Appellant has not shown clear and convincing evidence of a strong possibility that defense counsel was ineffective for failing to present the proffered photographs and testimony of his mother and\n   grandmother.\n   <em>\n    Simpson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6993361\" index=\"477\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/230/888/\">\n    2010 OK CR 6\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 53,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6993361\" index=\"478\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/230/888/\">\n    230 P.3d at 905-906\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-246\">\n   \u00b6222 Finally, Appellant asserts in his application that counsel was ineffective for failing to object to the audible gasps in the courtroom when the prosecutor displayed the in-life and post-mortem photographs of Henry during closing argument. Appellant refers us to Exhibit \"9\" to his application. This exhibit is the affidavit of Dale Anderson, who asserts that he heard audible gasps from the public seating area when these photos were displayed. As Appellant has not raised a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel in his brief predicated upon this assertion, we find that Appellant has waived appellate review of his request for supplementation of the record with this affidavit.

We consider this argument in conjunction with our mandatory sentence review pursuant to 21 O.S.2011, \u00a7 701.13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-254\">\n   \u00b6228 The State alleged and the jury found the presence of two aggravating circumstances: 1) the murder was especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel; and 2) the defendant posed a continuing threat to society. In Propositions VIII and IX, we determined that the State presented sufficient evidence to support the jury's finding of these two aggravating circumstances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-255\">\n   \u00b6229 Appellant alleged the following circumstances in mitigation of punishment: (1) he did not have any prior violent felony convictions; (2) his capacity to appreciate the criminality of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of law was impaired; (3) he was under the influence of mental disturbance at the time of the crime; (4) he acted under circumstances which tended to justify, excuse or reduce the crime; (5)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-256\">\n   he is likely to be rehabilitated; (6) he fully cooperated with the police when he was arrested; (7) he is only 23 years old today and was only 21 years old at the time of the offense; (8) he was diagnosed with a learning difficulty at an early age; (9) he was bullied, teased, and made fun of in school; (10) he had a negative emotional and family history; (11) he had suicidal thoughts when he was 13 years of age; (12) he was physically and verbally abused as a child; (13) he wanted to serve in the United States Navy, but was unable to complete requirements for such service; and (14) he was presented for mental health treatment and was denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-257\">\n   \u00b6230 Appellant presented the testimony of 18 witnesses in the sentencing stage of the trial, including his friends, neighbors, educators, family members, representatives of the Navy, and an administrator from a health care program. In addition to the evidence in mitigation detailed in Propositions IV and VI, the evidence showed that Appellant had a learning disability and had always struggled in the classroom. He participated in special education classes in school where it was determined that he had a normal intelligence quotient but experienced processing delays. By the eighth grade Appellant was very determined to get out of the special education classes. Due to his hard work he was able to transfer to a co-taught classroom in the Eighth grade. He was also able to accomplish his personal goal of making the school football team. Appellant's teachers found him to be respectful, quiet and polite.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-258\">\n   \u00b6231 The evidence further showed that Appellant's delays impacted his personal relationships. Appellant's family, neighbors, teachers and friends testified concerning his childhood. Some of Appellant's peers picked on him. He had a few friends but otherwise spent much of his time alone. Appellant was awkward around girls. Farlan Huff struggled to deal with Appellant's limitations, belittled him, and harshly disciplined him. This caused tension between them. Both Dana Huff and Farlan Huff had worked with Appellant to help him hide the fact that he was different. They encouraged Appellant to enter the military because they believed that this would fix him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-259\">\n   \u00b6232 The evidence also showed that certain individuals cared for Appellant and maintained a positive relationship with him despite the passage of time. Anthony Popovich, Appellant's best friend from childhood, maintained a relationship with Appellant even after Appellant moved away. Jackie Plese, one of Appellant's instructors, continued to correspond with Appellant after his arrest and incarceration for Henry's murder. Appellant's maternal grandparents, Stanley and Albertha Bench, also cared for Appellant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-260\">\n   \u00b6233 Appellant supplemented the evidence from the first stage indicating that he had psychological issues with lay witness testimony. This evidence showed that he was diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder as a child and had nightmares of a dark figure. As a teenager he engaged in obsessive handwashing and was diagnosed with compulsive personality disorder. He had to stop taking the medication prescribed to help him focus when he started to think about harming himself. Chief Southerland testified that he had sent Appellant to a psychiatrist for evaluation during his time in the Navy.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   Appellant exhibited signs of paranoia after the Navy discharged him. Farlan Huff tried to get him help at several mental health clinics but they turned Appellant away. A representative from the program in Ada corroborated Farlan Huff's assertion that Appellant was turned away from that program.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-261\">\n   \u00b6234 Based upon the record before us, we find the sentence of death to be factually substantiated and appropriate.\n   <em>\n    Malone\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6975753\" index=\"489\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/293/198/\">\n    2013 OK CR 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 79-87,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6975753\" index=\"490\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/293/198/\">\n    293 P.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   218-21 ;\n   <em>\n    Eizember\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8348038\" index=\"491\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/164/208/\">\n    2007 OK CR 29\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 145, 164 P.3d at 242.

At times he suggested that he had delusions about who the victim was, and at times he appeared to be feigning mental illness to escape liability. Regardless, the statements reasonably suggest that Appellant intended to cause the death of the victim. Second, the nature of the\n   victim's injuries, and the sequence of these horrible events, leave no doubt in my mind that Appellant acted with decidedly more than \"extreme disregard for human life.\" The Medical Examiner testified that the victim suffered repeated and extensive blunt force trauma to her head and torso, as well as bruising to her extremities. In short, it appeared that Appellant repeatedly stomped his victim until she died. What is more, he admitted to Dr. Grundy that after his first attack on the victim, he returned and attacked her a second time. The evidence suggested that the victim was conscious for some part of the attack, and fought back as best she could. The evidence also indicated that Appellant dragged her body across the floor while she was still conscious. The point here is not just that the attack was brutal and cruel; it clearly was. The point is that Appellant's extensive and protracted attack, and Henry's defensive attempts, convince me that no rational juror could have found any intent on Appellant's part but to kill her. The trial court properly rejected instructions on Depraved Mind Murder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-272\">\n   \u00b65 In Proposition VI, the Majority finds that the State's mental-health expert, Dr. Terese Hall, did not improperly comment on the veracity of other witnesses, but cautions that she came \"dangerously close\" to doing so at one point. I believe Dr. Hall's testimony was proper in all respects.

Here, both parties probed the bases for both experts' opinions, asking each what they considered, and what they considered probative.
