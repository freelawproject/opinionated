On appeal, defendant argues that (1) the uncharged sexual misconduct was inadmissible propensity evidence and it was substantially more prejudicial than probative, and (2) the threat evidence had little relevance because the threats were made after the abuse was reported and it was therefore unduly prejudicial because it suggested that defendant was a dangerous person. Defendant also asserts that the trial court failed to balance the probative value of the evidence in both instances against the danger of unfair prejudice to defendant.

As for A, the charges were for crimes that occurred beginning when he was 12 years old to the day before he turned 14 years old in 2007, and, on May 25, 2009, when A's mother, Rivera, reported the sexual abuse. Defendant moved\n   <em>\n    in limine\n   </em>\n   to preclude the state from introducing evidence of (1) sexual acts between defendant and C that occurred after C turned 18 years old until she was 22 years old; and (2) sexual misconduct that occurred for the greater-than-two-year period between A's fourteenth birthday and the\n   incident that occurred on May 25, 2009.

To admit evidence of the threats, the state relied on\n   <em>\n    Zybach\n   </em>\n   , in which the Supreme Court held that evidence of the defendant's continuing attempts to persuade the child victim to have sexual intercourse with him after raping her was admissible under OEC 404(3) to explain the nine-month delay between the rape and the victim's report of the rape in order to stop the defendant's unwanted \"advances.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2202487\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/308/96/#p100\">\n    308 Or. at 98-100\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2202487\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/308/96/#p100\">\n    775 P.2d 318\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In the state's view, because defendant's sexual offenses against A and C\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   occurred many years before they reported those offenses, under\n   <em>\n    Zybach\n   </em>\n   , the threats were relevant to show why it took a long time to report the charged abuse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Defendant's counsel responded as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   \"I think I kind of want to separate a couple of issues. First of all, there is evidence that the alleged victims in this case are afraid of my client. And I think that that's-I wouldn't call that character evidence because I think that's really-it's not a reflection of my client but, really, a reflection of their feelings towards my client. So I don't think that's really character evidence in and of itself. So I don't have a problem with that.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   \"But when we take a further step and say we're afraid of my client because of threats, that's where we start getting into character evidence of my client.

Specifically, C testified that the sexual contact did not end until she was 22 years old, and her testimony included a description of an incident during that period that was particularly graphic. A testified that he was sexually abused four or five times per month for a period of time leading up to the charged sexual crime that occurred in 2009. M testified that, \"because of what happened\" during the month that Rivera reported the abuse to police, defendant stated that he wanted to kill C and her daughter and that Rivera would \"rue the day.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   We reject without discussion defendant's challenges to the relevance and admissibility under OEC 404(3) of the uncharged sexual contact. As we explain below, because the trial court failed to expressly or implicitly weigh the probative value of the evidence against the risk of unfair prejudice to defendant before admitting it, we must reverse and remand for the trial court to reevaluate the probative value of the evidence and balance it against the risk of unfair prejudice.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

The state contends that defendant did not preserve that argument: \"Although defendant made a clear relevance objection to that evidence, he did not articulate a separate OEC 403 * * * objection to it-an objection that assumes the relevance of evidence but asks for its exclusion on the ground that 'its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.' \" (Quoting OEC 403.) The state adds that\n   defendant's assertion that the evidence was \"extremely prejudicial\" was part of his relevance objection,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , he was arguing that the disputed evidence was potentially dangerous and prejudicial character evidence. We disagree with that reading of the record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   We recently addressed, and rejected, a similar preservation argument in\n   <em>\n    Kelley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12570033\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/426/226/#p91\">\n    293 Or.

That is true notwithstanding the fact that, as the state points out, defendant's OEC 403 argument was raised with his relevance and OEC 404(3) arguments.

Although defendant raised the unfairly prejudicial effect of the evidence of uncharged sexual contact and threats-namely, the risk that the jury would use that evidence to convict defendant on the ground that he was a bad person, rather than on proof that he committed the charged conduct-the state focused exclusively on that evidence's probative value, primarily relying on\n   <em>\n    Stephens\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Zybach\n   </em>\n   (neither of which addressed OEC 403 balancing), and never addressed the risk of unfair prejudice from that evidence. Likewise, the record shows that the trial court's ruling reflected the state's argument, which concerned only the evidence's probative value. Unlike\n   <em>\n    Anderson\n   </em>\n   , where the trial court specifically indicated an\n   intention to view the disputed evidence in order to conduct OEC 403 balancing, the trial court here evinced no such intention; the record does not suggest that its ruling went beyond relevance. The record here lacks any indication that the court weighed the probative value of the contested evidence against its prejudicial effect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   We further conclude that the admission of the evidence was not harmless.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.
