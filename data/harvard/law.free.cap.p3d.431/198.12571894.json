(collectively \"Farmers\") to dismiss the complaint against them. For the following reasons, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    Factual and Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 2 \"In reviewing a trial court's decision to grant a motion to dismiss, we assume the truth of the facts asserted in the complaint.\"\n   <em>\n    Sw.

In February 2016, Doneson was injured in an automobile accident. He incurred approximately $22,000 in medical expenses, a portion of which was paid by workers' compensation benefits. He recovered $15,000 from a third-party tortfeasor and, pursuant\n   to A.R.S. \u00a7 23-1023(D), was required to reimburse his workers' compensation insurer in the amount of $8,750.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 3 At the time of the accident, Doneson was an insured under an automobile liability insurance policy issued by Farmers. The policy included a \"medpay\" provision that provided coverage for injuries sustained in an automobile accident. That policy contained an exclusion for \"bodily injury\" that \"[o]ccurr[ed] during the course of employment if workers' or workmen's compensation benefits are required.\" Doneson submitted a claim for $5,000 in medical bills, which Farmers denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 4 Doneson filed a complaint in the superior court alleging claims of breach of contract, declaratory relief, insurance bad faith, and interference with contract. Farmers filed a motion to dismiss the complaint, asserting the medpay claim was properly denied under the workers' compensation exclusion. The trial court granted Farmers's motion and dismissed the complaint with prejudice. Doneson appealed. We have jurisdiction pursuant to A.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 12-120.21(A)(1) and 12-2101(A)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    Motion to Dismiss\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 5 We review a trial court's grant of a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim under Rule 12(b)(6), Ariz.

Doneson claims the trial court erred in finding the workers' compensation exclusion barred his claim, arguing that the court should have considered other factors including the intent of the parties, public policy considerations, and extrinsic evidence, rather than enforcing the exclusion on the basis that it was unambiguous. The interpretation of a contract is a question of law that we review de novo.\n   <em>\n    Grosvenor Holdings, L.C. v. Figueroa\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4047206\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/222/588/\">\n    222 Ariz. 588\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 9,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4047206\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/222/588/\">\n    218 P.3d 1045\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (App. 2009).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 6 The sole issue on appeal is whether the policy exclusion providing for no coverage when \"workmen's compensation benefits are required\" applies when, as here, the injured worker has recovered from a third-party tortfeasor and reimbursed the employer's insurer for workers' compensation benefits pursuant to A.R.S. \u00a7 23-1023(D). Farmers asserts that benefits are \"required\" when an injured employee is entitled to receive workers' compensation benefits regardless of whether the employee \"sought, was ever paid, or was later required to reimburse workers' compensation benefits.\" Doneson claims that when an insured party reimburses a workers' compensation insurer for the benefits received, the insured has taken nothing, and therefore benefits were essentially not \"required.\" Doneson asserts the trial court erred in failing to consider parol evidence supporting his interpretation of the provision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 7 In determining whether to consider parol evidence to interpret a contract, a \"judge first considers the offered evidence and, if he or she finds that the contract language is 'reasonably susceptible' to the interpretation asserted by its proponent, the evidence is admissible to determine the meaning intended by the parties.\"\n   <em>\n    Taylor v.

In\n   <em>\n    Rubin v. State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co.\n   </em>\n   , on which Doneson principally relies,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   the Nevada Supreme Court considered a provision excluding coverage \"to the extent worker's compensation benefits are required to be payable.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9220495\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nev/118/299/\">\n    118 Nev. 299\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9220495\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nev/118/299/\">\n    43 P.3d 1018\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1020 (2002). But in that case, the court concluded that the word \"payable\" contained a \"latent ambiguity,\" as the benefits could be \"considered 'payable' under the exclusion, or 'not payable' since [the plaintiff] did not retain\n   them once [the workers' compensation insurer] was reimbursed from [the plaintiff's] third-party settlement.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1021. \"Payable\" was the word that was key to the court's finding of ambiguity in that case and the primary reason the exclusion did not apply to the plaintiff. Other cases cited by Doneson similarly concerned exclusion clauses with language materially different than the language at issue here.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Ritenour v.

In that case, the policy exclusion stated, \"This policy does not apply to bodily injury sustained by any person if benefits therefor are in whole or in part either payable or required to be provided under any Workmen's Compensation Law.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=122%20Cal.%20Rptr.%20508\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=122%20Cal.%20Rptr.%20508\">\n    at 509\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Nonetheless, the court found the policy exclusion applied because \"the additional language 'or required to be provided under any workmen's compensation law' creates an exclusion which is susceptible of only one reasonable and logical interpretation.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=122%20Cal.%20Rptr.%20508\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sunnyhill S., Inc. v.

But even under the\n   <em>\n    Taylor\n   </em>\n   standard, the party seeking to introduce extrinsic evidence must show that the language of the contract is \"reasonably susceptible\" to their proposed interpretation.\n   <em>\n    Taylor\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1501149\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/175/148/#p154\">\n    175 Ariz. at 154\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1501149\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/175/148/#p154\">\n    854 P.2d at 1140\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Although Doneson is correct that we must \"interpret an insurance policy according to its plain and ordinary meaning, examining it from the viewpoint of an individual untrained in law or business,\" he has not explained why the average insurance consumer would attribute any other than the facially plain meaning of the provision at issue, or how the language of the contract could support his interpretation.\n   <em>\n    Desert Mountain Props.
