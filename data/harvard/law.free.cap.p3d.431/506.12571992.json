CrRLJ 8.9(c) provides that whenever a judge is disqualified, \"the judge shall immediately make an order transferring and removing the case to another judge.\" Seattle Municipal Court informed DPD that it had no other judicial officer available to handle preliminary appearance hearings for those who exercised their right to file a notice of disqualification. The court thereafter instituted a policy that if an accused filed a notice of disqualification against the judge presiding over the in-custody preliminary appearance hearings, the court would transfer the matter to a different judge to make an in-chambers probable cause finding, to set bail, and to set a future arraignment date. As Judge Karen Donohue, then Presiding Judge at Seattle Municipal Court, explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   For decades, Seattle Municipal Court has held probable cause hearings on the record at the same time [as] the preliminary appearance and arraignment hearings are held. The court rules do not, however, require this procedure.

A municipal court judge remotely reviewed the police reports for the six cases needing probable cause determinations, found probable cause, set bail, and set these cases over to the following Monday's calendar for arraignment. The following Monday, December 4, 2017, the judge presiding over the in-custody calendar was confronted with 58 cases. The judge concluded the number of cases exceeded what could be completed in one morning and that Seattle Municipal Court did not have judicial resources available for an afternoon calendar in the jail. The judge set six cases over to the following day, Tuesday, December 5, 2017. Two of these cases had already been continued from the prior Saturday calendar because of notices of disqualification. The other four were individuals who had not filed disqualification notices. Seattle Municipal Court made probable cause and bail decisions in each case within the 48-hour deadline. But two individuals did not appear before a judge within 48 hours of their arrest, and, according to DPD, four individuals spent an additional night in jail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 6 On December 12, 2017, DPD, on behalf of its clients, petitioned King County Superior Court for a writ of review challenging Seattle Municipal Court's policy of delaying preliminary appearance hearings for those who file a notice of disqualification. DPD argued that Seattle Municipal Court's policy violated CrRLJ 3.2.1 and penalized individuals who exercised their right to file a notice of disqualification by requiring them to remain in jail longer than they would have otherwise. Seattle Municipal Court countered that because it had made probable cause and bail determinations within the required 48-hour timeframe, it was inconsequential that the preliminary appearance hearing took place after the time specified in the rule. It maintained that technical violations of the preliminary appearance rule should be disregarded where the 48-hour rule for probable cause and bail determinations had been satisfied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 7 On January 22, 2018, the superior court granted DPD's writ of review. It determined that Seattle Municipal Court's policy ensured that probable cause determinations were made within 48 hours of arrest and, thus, did not violate any arrestee's constitutional rights. It concluded, however, that the policy violated CrRLJ 3.2.1(d)(1) which \"unambiguously require[s] that when an individual is subjected to a warrantless arrest and held in jail, he or she must be brought before a judicial officer for a preliminary appearance hearing 'the next court day' following the arrest.\" It further concluded that filing a notice of disqualification did not waive the defendant's right to a timely preliminary appearance hearing. It ordered:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   The Seattle Municipal Court shall provide all persons detained in the King County Jail following a warrantless arrest on a misdemeanor\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   or gross misdemeanor charge a preliminary appearance hearing the next court day following his or her arrest regardless of whether he or she files [a notice of disqualification] against the judge initially assigned to hear that appearance.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Seattle Municipal Court appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <em>\n    ANALYSIS\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b6 8 Seattle Municipal Court raises three arguments on appeal. First, it argues that\n   because it makes probable cause and bail determinations within the constitutionally required 48-hour deadline, CrRLJ 3.2.1 should be interpreted to give the court flexibility to relax the \"next court day\" deadline when a defendant files a notice of disqualification under CrRLJ 8.9. Second, it contends that the \"next court day\" deadline in CrRLJ 3.2.1 is not mandatory but is, instead, merely a guide. Finally, it contends that its policy is a reasonable response to an extraordinary circumstance, which excuses strict compliance with the rule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b6 9 We reject Seattle Municipal Court's first two arguments because the language of the rule does not support them. And while we are sympathetic to the administrative burden Seattle Municipal Court faces under\n   <em>\n    Eng\n   </em>\n   , the record is insufficient to demonstrate an \"extraordinary circumstance\" justifying a delay in preliminary appearance hearings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <em>\n    Standard of Review\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b6 10 RCW 7.16.040 sets out the grounds for granting a writ of review.

CrRLJ 3.2.1 sets out only one exception. Under CrRLJ 3.2.1(d)(3), if an accused is unavailable due to physical or mental disability, the court may for good cause enlarge the time prior to a preliminary appearance.

Under CrRLJ 3.3(e)(9), when computing the deadline for commencing a defendant's trial, the court excludes five days if a judge is disqualified. No similar extension of time exists in CrRLJ 3.2.1. Again, canons of construction require the inference that the Washington Supreme Court understood that a judge could be disqualified from conducting a preliminary appearance hearing, and yet it did not authorize extending the deadline under such circumstances.

And in\n   <em>\n    Waganfeald v.

In\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   , the complicated nature of the crime required time to determine which court actually had jurisdiction over the accused.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3750522\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/675/472/#p478\">\n    675 F.3d at 478\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In\n   <em>\n    Waganfeald\n   </em>\n   , the court confronted a major natural disaster. Both cases presented the courts with extreme situations outside of their control. The record in this case reveals no similar set of extreme circumstances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   \u00b6 35 In this case, Seattle Municipal Court confronted the need to find a second judicial officer to handle a handful of preliminary appearance hearings that the judge presiding on the jail calendar could not handle, either because of a notice of disqualification or because of court congestion. Although there could be circumstances under which court congestion or judicial unavailability might justify delaying a preliminary appearance hearing (if, for example, we were to experience a natural disaster of the magnitude of Hurricane Katrina), there must be a sufficient factual record to justify a decision in any particular case.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Kenyon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4004678\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/167/130/#p137\">\n    167 Wash.2d 130\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 137-40,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=216%20P.3d%201024\">\n    216 P.3d 1024\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2009) (under speedy trial rule, judicial unavailability or court congestion may justify trial delay if trial court documents the lack of available courtrooms, judges, visiting judges, or judges pro tempore).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   \u00b6 36 The record before us does not justify a blanket policy of automatically delaying a hearing when a defendant files a notice of disqualification. The Seattle Municipal Court argued below that if\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   the Court were to accept the defense argument that the filing of [a notice of disqualification] requires the assignment of a different judge immediately before any release motions are heard, the potential negative ramification to the court and other defendants will be significant. The other six Municipal Court Judges hear a combination of pre-trial hearings, jury trials, motions hearings, review hearings and Mental Health Court pre-trials and contested competency hearings. Switching judges from their assigned calendars is disruptive, time consuming\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   and simply unfeasible. Thus, the practical effect of accepting [a notice of disqualification] in the jail court and requiring another judge to immediately hear the matter would be a delay of arraignment to the next business day.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   What the court does not explain, however, is why some of these other proceedings take precedence over preliminary appearance hearings. For example, why is a \"review hearing\" something that a judge could not postpone if he or she was needed in the jail? Obviously, the court cannot violate one defendant's speedy trial rights to ensure another defendant has a timely preliminary appearance hearing. But the Seattle Municipal Court has seven judges and five magistrates, each of whom could be designated as a pro tempore judge to handle one or two hearings in an afternoon. Seattle Municipal Court has not adequately explained why the disqualification of one judge on a morning calendar renders it impossible for another judge or magistrate to cover a preliminary appearance hearing by the end of that same court day.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   \u00b6 37 We recognize that RCW 35.20.100 and article IV, section 7 of the Seattle City Charter set limits on the number of Seattle Municipal Court judges who can sit at any one time.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Eng\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1172035\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/113/178/\">\n    113 Wash.2d at 189-95\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=776%20P.2d%201336\">\n    776 P.2d 1336\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
