Despite that warning and numerous others during the trial, defendant engaged in disruptive conduct throughout the trial, and, before closing argument, he informed the trial court that he would not abide by its order prohibiting him from referring to information that had not been admitted into evidence. After confirming that defendant intended to violate its order, the trial court removed defendant from the courtroom for the remainder of the trial day.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The jury found defendant guilty of most of the charged crimes.

On the state's petition, this court allowed review. As explained below, we conclude that, while representing himself, defendant made a knowing and voluntary choice to be removed from the courtroom and leave the defense table empty and the trial court did not violate defendant's Sixth Amendment rights by accepting that choice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   I. HISTORICAL AND PROCEDURAL FACTS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The state brought two criminal cases against defendant, alleging multiple counts of unlawful manufacture,\n   delivery, and possession of marijuana, and criminal forfeiture.\n   <em>\n    See former\n   </em>\n   ORS 475.856 (2011) (manufacture);\n   <em>\n    former\n   </em>\n   ORS 475.860 (2011) (delivery);\n   <em>\n    former\n   </em>\n   ORS 475.864 (2011) (possession);\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   ORS 131.582 (criminal forfeiture). The state also alleged two sentencing enhancement facts in connection with the crimes charged in the second case. The cases, which involved a total of 32 counts, were consolidated for trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Before trial, defendant was represented by four different attorneys in succession. He retained the first two, each of whom withdrew\n   at his request. He then requested a court-appointed attorney. The trial court granted that request and appointed defendant's third attorney. That attorney later withdrew after defendant unsuccessfully attempted to fire him. The trial court then appointed a fourth attorney, Scales. At trial call, Scales reported that he would be ready for trial on the scheduled trial date. Defendant disagreed and then disobeyed the trial court's orders to be quiet and allow Scales to speak. The trial court held defendant in contempt for three successive violations of its orders, imposing a greater fine each time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   At a subsequent trial call held the week before the scheduled trial date, Scales reported that he was ready for trial. After that, defendant filed a motion asking the trial court for a continuance or, in the alternative, to discharge Scales. At that point, the first case had been pending for about three years, and the second case had been pending for about two years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The trial court held a hearing on defendant's motion the day before the scheduled trial date. At the hearing, Scales asked to withdraw as defendant's counsel. Scales informed the court that it appeared that defendant, who had been filing motions on his own, wanted to represent himself. Scales also informed the court that defendant was insisting on raising a defense based on an interpretation of the Oregon Medical Marijuana Act that the trial court had rejected at a prior hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The trial court denied defendant's request for a continuance. It encouraged defendant to continue with Scales as his attorney, explaining that neither Scales nor defendant could raise the defense defendant wanted to raise because, as it had already ruled, the defense was based on an incorrect statutory interpretation. The trial court also advised defendant that, if he proceeded\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   and engaged in disruptive conduct, he would be removed from the courtroom and the trial would proceed without him and without defense counsel:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   \"THE COURT: Let me tell you another reason why [proceeding\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   ] may be a bad idea. One of the things I'm concerned about in this trial is you speaking out of turn or arguing with me after a ruling. And I told you I'm gonna hold you in contempt. And what I'm going to do or what I intend to do to enforce that is to have you removed from the courtroom. If you're not going to behave in court, then you give up the right to be in court.\n   <em>\n    If you have an attorney, your attorney will still be here and can continue to advocate for you, continue to ask questions of witnesses and represent your interests. If you're representing yourself and you're removed from the court, then there's no one sitting at that table *** and we'll just go on without you.\n   </em>\n   \"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   (Emphasis added.) The trial court repeated that warning, telling defendant that if he engaged in misconduct he would be held in jail for the rest of the trial day:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   \"THE COURT: *** [T]hat's what I'm going to do. I don't want you speaking out of turn. I don't want you arguing. And what I'm going to do is hold you in contempt if you do that and by making the contempt finding, invoke the sanction of having you removed from the courtroom for the rest of the day. You'll go to jail; you'll sit out the rest of the day in jail. At the end of the trial day, you will be released with an order to come back the next day for the next day of trial, and we'll try again. As long as you behave, you can stay here in court.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   \"* * * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   \"[DEFENDANT]: I understand.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   \"THE COURT:\n   <em>\n    And that's why, that's yet another and very good reason why I think it's a good idea that you keep Mr. Scales as your attorney.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   \"[DEFENDANT]:\n   <em>\n    Well, we're not gonna do that. So we don't need to talk about it anymore.\n   </em>\n   \"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   (Emphasis added.) The trial court continued to advise defendant of the risks of self-representation and, after it did, defendant chose to proceed\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   and the trial court allowed Scales to withdraw.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The case was tried over four days, during which defendant repeatedly engaged in misconduct by arguing with the trial court after it ruled and by failing to abide by its rulings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Throughout the trial, the trial court warned defendant that he would be removed from the courtroom if he continued his misconduct and the trial would proceed in his absence. On the third day of trial, the trial court admonished defendant outside of the presence of the jury, stating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   \"THE COURT: Alright. The reason I asked the jury to step out is because you are arguing with me in an area that I have specifically told you you're not going to argue with me, and you keep talking after I interrupt you and tell you what my ruling is. That is contempt of court. I've told you what was gonna happen if I held you in contempt of court, and that is that\n   <em>\n    you go to jail and spend the rest of the day there until we finish our proceedings for the day, and then we'll try again the next day. I really don't want to do that because there's no one sitting at your table to carry the ball while you're gone.\n   </em>\n   \"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   (Emphasis added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   On the fourth and final day of trial, both parties had rested their cases. The trial court and defendant then had an extended discussion about closing arguments, and defendant stated that, in his closing argument, he intended to refer to his medical marijuana card, which had not been admitted into evidence. The court ruled that defendant could not refer to the card or read it to the jury, because it was not in evidence. The court repeated its ruling numerous times in response to defendant's questions and contentions, but defendant refused to accept the court's ruling. He continuously interrupted the court and became defiant and aggressive. He disobeyed the court's orders, stated multiple times that he intended to read from the card, and challenged the court to remove him from the courtroom. In response, the\n   trial court told defendant, \"I think what you're trying to do is *** to remove yourself from the trial.\" Defendant said he was not, but continued to state that he would use the card in closing argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Based on defendant's refusal to abide by its orders and his expressed intention to refer to information that was not in evidence, the trial court eventually held defendant in contempt of court and removed him from the courtroom.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   After making a record of its reasons for removing defendant, the trial court proceeded with the trial. The state made its closing argument, the case was submitted to the jury, and the jury returned its verdict, finding defendant guilty on all but four counts. Immediately thereafter, the trial court held a trial on the two sentencing enhancement facts, and the jury found both of the sentencing enhancement facts. On a later date, defendant appeared with retained counsel for sentencing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Defendant appealed, asserting that the trial court had violated his Sixth Amendment \"right to representation.\" The Court of Appeals agreed, holding that, although defendant had waived his right to counsel before trial and had forfeited his rights to be present and self-representation during trial, he had not forfeited his \"right to representation.\"\n   <em>\n    Lacey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12411577\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or-app/282/123/#p127\">\n    282 Or.

Regarding the majority's concern about \"the danger of an empty counsel table,\" Judge Garrett observed that a defendant's right to\n   self-representation \"presumes that a defendant's right to control his own representation is superior to the state's more generalized interest in ensuring that defendants are vigorously and competently represented by counsel.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 140 n. 3,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12411577\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or-app/282/123/#p127\">\n    385 P.3d 1151\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The state petitioned for review, asking this court to address what a trial court should do when a\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   defendant is removed from the courtroom for misconduct during trial. The state noted that the question was an open one in this court and that other jurisdictions are divided on it.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   We allowed review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   II. PARTIES' ARGUMENTS ON REVIEW\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   On review, the state argues that the trial court did not err by proceeding with the trial in defendant's absence. Specifically, the state argues that, if a defendant \"validly waives his right to counsel, and then, while representing himself, engages in misconduct that waives his right to be present, the court may continue the trial in his absence without obtaining a second waiver of the right to counsel or appointing new counsel.\" The state further argues that, even if a second waiver of the right to counsel is required, in this case, defendant waived that right through his misconduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   In response, defendant argues, \"The absence of anyone to represent the defendant during trial offends the notion of an adversarial judicial system and cannot yield a fair trial.\" \"Thus,\" he further argues, \"if a defendant waives his right to counsel, and invokes his right to self-representation, engaging in misconduct at trial does not forfeit his constitutional right *** to\n   <em>\n    a\n   </em>\n   defense presence ***.\" (Emphasis in original.) According to defendant, \"when a\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   defendant is removed from the courtroom for misconduct, thus forfeiting his right to presence and right to self-representation,\n   the court must find a way to protect the defendant's constitutional right to counsel.\" (Footnote omitted.) Therefore, defendant concludes, the trial court in\n   this case erred because it \"did not secure a waiver of defendant's right to representation, it did not appoint counsel, and it did not take other measures to protect defendant's right to representation after it removed him from the courtroom.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   III. ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The issue in this case implicates three Sixth Amendment rights: the right to counsel, the right to self-representation, and the right to be present during court proceedings.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   We begin with a brief discussion of those rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Sixth Amendment Rights\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    Right to Counsel\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The Sixth Amendment expressly guarantees criminal defendants the right to counsel. It provides, \"In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right *** to have the Assistance of Counsel for his defence.\" The right to counsel is a \"fundamental\" right.\n   <em>\n    Gideon v.

Nor does he dispute that, during trial, he knowingly and voluntarily engaged in conduct for which the trial court permissibly found him in contempt of court and removed him from the courtroom for the remainder of the day. He argues only that, after removing him from the courtroom for misconduct, the trial court had to appoint counsel or take other steps to ensure that he was represented. He contends that, despite his waiver and misconduct, he retained a \"right of representation,\" and, therefore, the trial court could not proceed with the trial in his absence unless and until it either secured a waiver of that right or appointed counsel or took other measures to protect that right.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   We recognize the importance of a defense presence at trial. However, in keeping with\n   <em>\n    Faretta\n   </em>\n   , we also recognize that a defendant has the right to self-representation, which is based on respect for the defendant's autonomy, and that, when exercising that right, a defendant can choose not to participate in, or even attend, trial. Based on the circumstances of this case, we conclude that that is what defendant did. The trial court found that defendant was trying to get himself removed from the courtroom, and the record supports that finding. The trial court clearly and repeatedly warned defendant that, if he insisted that he would violate the court's order prohibiting him from referring to\n   information that had not been admitted into evidence, he would be removed from the courtroom and no one would be present to represent him. Despite those warnings, defendant insisted that he would violate the order. By doing so, he made a knowing and voluntary choice to be removed from the courtroom and leave the defense table empty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   If defendant had simply walked out of the courtroom, there would be no question that the trial court could proceed with the trial in defendant's absence. A defendant cannot force a trial court to appoint counsel or to suspend a trial simply by removing himself from the courtroom. Nor can a defendant do so by having himself removed from the courtroom. When a defendant waives the right to counsel knowing that, if he is removed from the courtroom for misconduct, no one will be present to represent him, and then, while representing himself, intentionally engages in misconduct that he knows will result in his removal, the defendant is choosing to not to participate in or be present at trial. In that circumstance, a trial court can accept the defendant's choice.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   The trial court is not required to appoint counsel or take other measures to provide a defense presence. A trial court may do so, and it may be advisable for it to do so, but it is not required to do so.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   In holding otherwise, the Court of Appeals relied on its decision in\n   <em>\n    Menefee\n   </em>\n   . But it does not appear that the defendant in\n   <em>\n    Menefee\n   </em>\n   received warnings like those defendant received in this case. Specifically, it does not appear that the defendant was warned that, if he chose to exercise his right to self-representation and then engaged in misconduct, he would be removed from the courtroom and the trial would continue without anyone present to represent him. Thus, in\n   <em>\n    Menefee\n   </em>\n   , the defendant's waiver of the right to counsel may not have been knowingly made, in that he may not have been aware of a critical consequence of the waiver. Therefore, the trial court may not have been able to rely on that waiver after it removed the defendant from the courtroom. In addition, it does not appear that defendant in\n   <em>\n    Menefee\n   </em>\n   was warned that the type of conduct he engaged in could result in his removal from the courtroom. Given the lack of warnings about both the consequences of the waiver of the right to counsel and the consequences of the defendant's conduct, it made sense for the Court of Appeals to rule that a \"trial court cannot proceed in the defendant's absence unless and until [it] has either secured the defendant's waiver of his or her right to representation at trial or has taken some other course of action that protects the defendant's right to representation ***.\"\n   <em>\n    Menefee\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4252837\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or-app/268/154/\">\n    268 Or.

Mack\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9267354\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/362/597/#p601\">\n    362 F.3d 597\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 601 (9th Cir. 2004), the Ninth Circuit held that the trial court had erred because it had removed the defendant who had been acting \"as his own counsel and nobody stepped in to fill the gap,\" which \"effectively [left] him without representation.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   But\n   <em>\n    Carroll\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Mack\n   </em>\n   are distinguishable from this case, because it does not appear that the defendants in those cases were warned, prior to waiving their right to counsel, that, if they proceeded\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   and were removed from the courtroom for misconduct, their trials would continue\n   without anyone\n   present to represent them. Thus, the defendants' waivers of counsel may not have been made with the knowledge of a critical consequence, and, therefore, the trial courts may not have been able to rely on the waivers after removing the defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   To be sure, the defendants in\n   <em>\n    Carroll\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Mack\n   </em>\n   were warned during trial that, if they continued to engage in specific misconduct, they would be removed from their courtrooms and their trials would continue without anyone present to represent them. Thus, their misconduct could be characterized as knowing and voluntary. Consequently,\n   <em>\n    Carroll\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Mack\n   </em>\n   can be read as holding that, if a trial court removes a\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   defendant from the courtroom for voluntarily engaging in conduct that he knew would result in his removal and leave the defense table empty, the trial court cannot proceed with the trial unless and until it either appoints counsel or takes other steps to ensure that the defendant is represented. To the extent that those cases so hold, they are at odds with the right of a\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   defendant to choose whether and how to defend himself. After all, a\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   defendant can choose to plead guilty or no contest to the charges against him, if the choice is knowingly and voluntarily made. Given the deference afforded to a defendant's autonomy, we conclude that a trial court is not prohibited from proceeding with a trial if a\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   defendant makes a voluntary choice to engage in conduct that he knows will result in his removal and leave him without anyone present to represent him. Therefore, the trial court in this case did not err by proceeding with the trial in defendant's absence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   The decision of the Court of Appeals is reversed.
