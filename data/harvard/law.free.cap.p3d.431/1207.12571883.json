After his mother wired a gift of $120 into his inmate trust account, the Arizona Department of Economic Security (\"ADES\") issued a withholding order seizing most of it and sent the money to the child-support clearinghouse. Torres argues non-wage monies in an inmate's account may not be seized for child support and contends the withholding order violated his due-process rights. For the following reasons, we affirm the superior court's judgment denying Torres's appeal of the administrative action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 2 In 2001, the superior court ordered Torres to pay $173 a month in child support for his son and $2,941 in arrearages that had accumulated since the child was born the year before. In 2011, the court learned Torres was incarcerated and terminated his monthly child support obligation pursuant to Arizona Revised Statutes (\"A.R.S.\") section 25-503(E) (2018).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court's order, however, noted, \"Arrears are still owed.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 3 In November 2016, Torres's mother wired $120 into his inmate trust account. By that time, and even though Torres's monthly payments had been terminated, he owed child-support arrearages of $20,645. Days later, acting under Title IV-D of the Social Security Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20651\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 651\n   </extracted-citation>\n   - 669, ADES issued a Limited Income Withholding Order that directed the Arizona Department of Corrections (\"ADC\") to withhold an unspecified amount from Torres's account for application against his arrearages. ADC withheld $90.07 from Torres's account, and he requested administrative review. Torres argued the order was improper because he was incarcerated and did not have custody of his son. ADES issued a final determination denying his challenge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 4 Torres appealed the ADES determination to the superior court. ADES moved to\n   dismiss Torres's appeal, arguing its order was proper under A.R.S. \u00a7 25-505(A) (2018). Torres responded that A.R.S. \u00a7 31-254 (2018) controls the withholding of an inmate's funds for child support and does not allow seizure of funds a prisoner receives as a gift. The superior court granted the motion to dismiss and Torres timely appealed. We have jurisdiction under Article 6, Section 9, of the Arizona Constitution, and A.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 12-120.21(A)(1) (2018), -913 (2018) and -2101(A)(1) (2018).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Svendsen v.

As Torres points out, there is no provision in \u00a7 31-254 for the withholding of non-wage monies from an inmate's account for child support. Torres argues that because \u00a7 31-254 mandates that child support be taken from an inmate's wages but does not specify any other deductions for child support, no other funds in an inmate's account can be taken for child support.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 7 Under A.R.S. \u00a7 25-504 (2018), a party owed child support is entitled to an assignment of the obligor's \"income\" and may obtain an order withholding a specified amount from the obligor's monthly wages. A.R.S. \u00a7 25-504(A), (B). The legislature broadly has defined \"income\" for this purpose as \"any form of payment owed.\" A.R.S. \u00a7 25-500(6) (2018). As stated, when the obligor is an inmate who earns income-wages-while incarcerated, \u00a7 31-254 expressly provides that 30 percent of those wages be deducted for child support.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 8 The order at issue here, however, was not directed at Torres's wages pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 31-254(D)(4) and 25-504. Instead, it was a one-time \"limited\" withholding order issued pursuant to \u00a7 25-505. That statute does not apply to regularly recurring income, but instead authorizes issuance of a withholding order to \"any employer, payor or other holder of a nonperiodic or lump sum payment that is owed or held for the benefit of an obligor.\" Under \u00a7 25-505, a \"holder\" of such a payment may be required to \"withhold ... and transmit\" the specified funds to the support clearinghouse. A.R.S. \u00a7 25-505(D).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 9 Although \u00a7 31-254(D)(4) mandates what may be taken from an inmate's\n   <em>\n    wages\n   </em>\n   for child support pursuant to \u00a7 25-504, it imposes no limits on what may be taken pursuant to \u00a7 25-505 from a \"\n   <em>\n    nonperiodic or lump sum payment\n   </em>\n   \" in an inmate's account. Nor do other provisions in the statutory regime support Torres's contention that the wage deduction specified in \u00a7 31-254 impliedly precludes any other withdrawal for child support under \u00a7 25-505. To the contrary, A.R.S. \u00a7 25-521 (2018) empowers ADES to levy \"on all property and rights to property not exempt under federal or state law\" to collect support arrearages, and Torres cites no legal exemption shielding an inmate's trust account from that broad power. Further, the legislature has mandated that child-support obligations \"may be enforced by all civil and criminal remedies provided by law\" and that remedies available under Chapter 5 of Title 25 \"are cumulative and do not affect the availability of [other] remedies.\" A.R.S. \u00a7 25-501(D), (E) (2018).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 10 Torres contrasts \u00a7 31-254 with A.R.S. \u00a7 31-230(C) (2018), which requires ADC to withdraw a specified percentage of funds in an inmate's \"spendable account\" to satisfy the inmate's restitution obligation. Torres argues the legislature's failure to enact a comparable statute specifically granting ADES the power to take non-wage funds from an inmate's account for child support means that ADES must lack that power. Given the broad authority the legislature has granted ADES under \u00a7\u00a7 25-501 and -521 to collect past-due child support, however, no specific provision addressing inmates' trust accounts is required. For the same reason, we reject Torres's contention that penological interests and ADC policy reasons should constrain ADES's power to take funds from an inmate's account.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Rasmussen v.

ADC Was a Holder of a Lump Sum Payment Under A.R.S. \u00a7 25-505.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 11 Torres also argues the withholding order ADES issued to ADC was improper because his mother's gift was not a \"lump sum payment\" under \u00a7 25-505(E). As stated, under \u00a7 25-505, ADES may issue a withholding order \"to any employer, payor or other holder of a nonperiodic or lump sum payment that is owed or held for the benefit of an obligor.\" The statute defines neither \"nonperiodic\" nor \"lump sum,\" but subsection (E) states:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 12 For the purposes of this section, \"lump sum payment\" includes:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   1.

Personal injury awards.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b6 13 \"Nonperiodic payment\" and \"lump sum payment\" both have ordinary meanings. The former is a payment made once, or intermittently, but not \"periodically\" or regularly. The latter is a payment made all at once, not in installments. Notwithstanding Torres's argument to the contrary, under the plain meaning of the statute, his mother's gift was a single payment made all at once, and thus was a \"lump sum payment\" under that term's ordinary meaning.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b6 14 In arguing otherwise, Torres contends the term \"lump sum payment\" means\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   the types of payments listed in \u00a7 25-505(E). But subsection (E) states that \"lump sum payment\n   <em>\n    includes\n   </em>\n   \" the listed forms of payments, and \"[t]he word 'includes' is most often a term of enlargement, rather than limitation.\"\n   <em>\n    Tracy v.

In other words, when the legislature does not define a term, but states that the term \"includes\" specified items, we construe the term to also include other items that fall within the term's ordinary meaning.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1459018\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/168/23/#p35\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1459018\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/168/23/#p35\">\n    at 35\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1459018\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/168/23/#p35\">\n    810 P.2d at 1042\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , citing 2A N.

We construe statutes that are related to the same subject matter as though they constitute one law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hayden\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"648349\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/210/522/#p523\">\n    210 Ariz. at 523, \u00b6 7\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"648349\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/210/522/#p523\">\n    115 P.3d at 117-18\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Elsewhere in the support-collection statutes, the legislature has used the verb \"means\" to state a term's only meaning, while using \"includes\" to introduce a non-exclusive list.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   A.R.S. \u00a7 25-522(G)(1) (2018) (\" '[b]usiness day' means a day on which state offices are open for regular business\")\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   A.R.S. \u00a7 25-522(G)(2) (\" '[d]epartment' includes the department's agent\").\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   Antonin Scalia &amp; Bryan A. Garner,\n   <em>\n    Reading Law: The Interpretation of Legal Texts\n   </em>\n   226 (2012) (\"When a definitional section says that a word 'includes' certain things, that is usually\n   taken to mean that it may include other things as well....

By the same token, the statute authorizes issuance of an order not only to an obligor's employer (compelling withholding from a \"payment that is owed\" to the obligor) but also to a \"holder\" of a payment that has been made to an obligor, whether \"owed\" or not. A.R.S. \u00a7 25-505(A). \"[W]e assume that when the legislature uses different language within a statutory scheme, it does so with the intent of ascribing different meanings and consequences to that language.\"\n   <em>\n    Parker v.

By this reasoning, we conclude that \"lump sum payment\" as used in \u00a7 25-505 can include any payment made in a lump sum, \"owed\" to the obligor or not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b6 18 Torres further argues it was improper to allow seizure of funds his mother sent him as a Christmas gift. Arizona law, however, affords ADES the full panoply of remedies to enforce a child-support arrearage. If Torres's mother had wired her gift to his bank account, ADES could have garnished the bank account.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   A.R.S. \u00a7 25-521, -524 (2018);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Huggins v.

If he were not incarcerated and she had sent him cash that he used to buy property, ADES could perfect a lien on the property. A.R.S. \u00a7 25-516(A) (2018). If he kept the cash in a drawer at home, ADES could seize the money there. A.R.S. \u00a7 25-521(A). Thus, the only issue is whether ADES properly used a withholding order in this instance, not whether ADES could reach the gift by any means.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b6 19 In sum, the gift Torres's mother sent him was a lump sum payment, and once the money reached his inmate trust account, ADC became a \"holder ... of a lump sum payment that is ... held for the benefit of an obligor.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   A.R.S. \u00a7 25-505(A).
