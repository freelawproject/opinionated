In the published opinion originally filed in this appeal, we held that a public trial violation required us to reverse and remand for a new trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b6 2 On the same morning we filed our original opinion, the Washington Supreme Court filed its opinion in\n   <em>\n    State v. Schierman,\n   </em>\n   in which it held that the closure of a criminal trial can sometimes be too inconsequential, given the purposes of the public trial right, to constitute a violation. --- Wash.2d ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12566364\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/415/106/#p193\">\n    415 P.3d 106\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 193 (2018) (Yu, J., concurring/dissenting). It adopted a widely accepted de minimis test from\n   <em>\n    Peterson v.

We granted the State's motion for reconsideration and withdrew our opinion in order to reach the issue of whether the closure in this case was de minimis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 3 We hold that the public trial right does not apply to rulings excluding witnesses under ER 615 but did apply to motions in limine that were raised before testimony began. Applying the\n   <em>\n    Peterson\n   </em>\n   test, we hold that the closed hearing of at least one of the motions in limine cannot be characterized as de minimis. We again reverse and remand for a new trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 4 Facts underlying the charges against Patrick Karas for the most part are unimportant\n   to this appeal. On the first morning of trial in September 2016, the jury was selected and was read the pattern advance oral instruction. The trial court then told jurors:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   Now, folks, we're going to take up some matters, outside your presence. And, then, we'll have you back here, after lunch, for opening statements.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   And let's have you back in the jury room, at 1:30, and we'll try to take up as quickly as we can after 1:30.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Report of Proceedings (RP) at 81.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The trial court cautioned jurors against discussing the case with anyone and told them the bailiff was then going to \"show you where your new home away from home is.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"571739\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/85/39/#p43\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"571739\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/85/39/#p43\">\n    at 82\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 5 Although not reflected in the report of proceedings, a chambers conference then took place. The report of proceedings takes up again with proceedings in open court, but outside the presence of the jury:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   THE COURT: Okay. For the record, Counsel met in chambers, and discussed only legal issues. And we did discuss some motions.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   One was a motion to exclude witnesses, by the defendant. The Court granted that motion.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   And the Court was advised that the State will have Officer Josh Mathena as its representative, to be seated at counsel table. Everyone else is excluded.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   There's also a motion, by the defendant, to keep out testimony by-who was the officer? Corulli?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Corulli.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   THE COURT: Corulli, who, apparently, in his report, indicates some statements made by a cashier, at a business across from the alleged victim's business. And the Court granted that motion. Officer Corulli can't talk about what the cashier said.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   It was also indicated that the alleged victim had that conversation with the cashier. And the Court did not grant a motion in limine, preventing the alleged victim from talking about what he said to the cashier.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   And, the way it was presented, what the cashier said to him, was not being offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   So counsel can renew the objection to that, if you want. But, right now, it sounds like that's the route we got to go, at this point in time.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   Anything else we need to put on the record?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   (Discussion had off record.)\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"571739\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/85/39/#p43\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"571739\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/85/39/#p43\">\n    at 82-83\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The report of proceedings next indicates, \"Lunch recess taken.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"571739\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/85/39/#p43\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b6 6 The chambers conference was not recorded. Our record does not contain court minutes or any other information on how long the chambers conference lasted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b6 7 The report of proceedings picks up again after the lunch recess, when the proceedings continued with opening statements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b6 8 The trial court had some familiarity with the conversation in the market that was the subject matter of the motion in limine from a CrR 3.5 hearing that had taken place several months earlier. During that hearing, a detective testified that Mr. Karas might have overheard Micah England, the victim of the burglary and theft, tell a cashier at a nearby market about where, in his fabrication shop, he kept his petty cash. At the CrR 3.5 hearing, the detective told the court:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   And unbeknownst to Micah at the time, but the cashier later reported to Micah that Mr. Karas was actually in the Malaga Market at that time, in an aisle, over a little bit, and potentially heard this conversation. Thus, giving Mr. Karas knowledge of money that is kept inside the office, at Micah's Fabrication.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   And, so, Micah relayed that information to me.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   RP at 18-19. The detective testified that it was when he confronted Mr. Karas about this information that Mr. Karas agreed to tell him what happened. RP at 19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b6 9 Because the trial court denied the second motion in limine, the State was able to and did offer Mr. England's testimony about the conversation at trial. Mr. Karas's\n   lawyer chose not to renew the objection.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mr. England testified that after he was shown surveillance video in which Mr. Karas appeared to enter his business on the night of the burglary, he remembered a prior contact with Mr. Karas:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   A. ... The-the Saturday I was at the store. I was in the-went into the store, to purchase some items.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   Q. Which store was that?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   A. Malaga Market.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   Q. And where's the Malaga Market, in reference to your business?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   A. I's less than ten minute's away.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   Q. Okay. And why were you at the Malaga Market?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   A. I was making some purchases, in the morning-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   Q. Okay.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   A. -to go do some stuff. And the gal had asked me if I had any-any small bills; ones, fives, or tens.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   Q. And why-why would she be asking you that?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   A. Because on-on certain weekends, they just run out of small bills, and they'll call me, or ask me if I have them.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   Q. Oh, okay.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   A. If they-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   Q. And you trade them out?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   A. Yeah. We trade them out.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   Q. Okay. And, when she asked you this, what did you indicate?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   A. I said, Yes, I'll go back-I do have them. I'll go back to my office and get them. And I'll be back. And, then that's-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   Q. Okay. And did you do that, then?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   A. Yes, I did.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   Q. Okay. And, so, on that day, then, you actually saw your petty cash envelope, and stuff?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   A. Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   Q. Okay. And, when you were at the Malaga Market, was anybody else there, besides the employee you were talking to?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   A.

Within earshot?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   A. Yeah.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   Q. And did you say or have any conversation with Mr. Karas, on that occasion?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   A. No.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   RP at 90-91.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   \u00b6 10 At the close of trial, the jury found Mr. Karas guilty of second degree burglary and third degree theft. Following entry of the felony judgment and sentence, Mr. Karas appealed. For the first time, he alleged that the chambers conference on the morning of the first day of trial was a public trial violation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   \u00b6 11 Mr. Karas contends the trial court violated his right to a public trial when it heard unrecorded arguments and ruled on motions in chambers without conducting a\n   <em>\n    Bone-Club\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   analysis. The State argues there was no public trial right violation and, following\n   <em>\n    Schierman\n   </em>\n   , argues that the closure was de minimis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   I.

Smith,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4356663\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/181/508/#p513\">\n    181 Wash.2d 508\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 513,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=334%20P.3d%201049\">\n    334 P.3d 1049\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2014) (some alterations in original) (quoting\n   <em>\n    State v.

After\n   <em>\n    Schierman,\n   </em>\n   the second step should address any contention that because the closure was de minimis, it did not violate the defendant's public trial right.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   We reframe the second step as \"whether, if the public trial right is implicated, there is in fact a closure of the courtroom that is not de minimis.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   \u00b6 14 At issue first is whether the public trial right attached to the trial court's hearing of three motions. The first motion sought routine application of the court's authority to exclude witnesses under ER 615, triggering the State's right under that rule to designate a representative who would not be excluded. The second and third motions were case-specific motions in limine involving the conversation between the victim and the store cashier that Mr. Karas is alleged to have overheard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   \u00b6 15 In the second motion, Mr. Karas asked the court to exclude any testimony by Officer Douglas Corulli about what the cashier told him about the conversation with Mr. England that could have been overheard by Mr. Karas. That motion was granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   \u00b6 16 In the third motion, Mr. Karas asked the court to exclude any testimony by Mr. England about his conversation with the cashier. The court denied the motion to exclude Mr. England's testimony, apparently persuaded that what was said would not be offered for its truth. While denying the motion, the court added, \"counsel can renew the objection [as] to that.\" RP at 83.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   \u00b6 17 From the trial judge's statement on the record that he and the lawyers \"discussed only legal issues\" in chambers, he appears to have assumed that \"legal issues\" do not implicate public trial rights.

But a unanimous Supreme Court held that the chambers conference in\n   <em>\n    Whitlock\n   </em>\n   was not a \"proper\" sidebar conference. One reason was that the conference took place in chambers. Because a judge's chambers are closed to the public, the Court refused to treat a chambers conference as the functional equivalent of a conference at the bar. A second reason was the delay in memorializing what had occurred, particularly where there had been no reason for not handling the argument as a sidebar and recording it in real time.\n   <em>\n    Whitlock,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=188%20Wash.%202d%20511\">\n    188 Wash.2d at 522-23\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=396%20P.3d%20310\">\n    396 P.3d 310\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   \u00b6 22 Mr. Karas's argument proceeds as if\n   <em>\n    Whitlock\n   </em>\n   held that anything that is not a sidebar is subject to the public trial right. But we do not read\n   <em>\n    Whitlock\n   </em>\n   as treating the characteristics of a proper sidebar as the new litmus test for applying the public trial right. It was because the State characterized the chambers conference as sidebar-like and invoked\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   that the Supreme Court focused on whether the conference qualified as a \"proper\" sidebar.

Whether to exclude witnesses under ER 615 and who an attorney will designate as a client representative to attend trial falls in the category of housekeeping measures unrelated to the merits of a case. It is not uncommon for such housekeeping measures to be discussed in chambers or in a nonpublic scheduling call, or for them to be decided without discussion by a trial court that simply announces its usual practice. Public access plays no significant positive role in the application of ER 615, which is rarely a matter of dispute and not very consequential if there is a dispute.

We do not disagree with the observation that motions in limine are decided outside the hearing of the jury, but the question remains whether they have historically been decided somewhere other than in an open courtroom. Even if jurors must be absent, the defendant (when present) and members of the public may listen to proceedings that take place in an open courtroom.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   \u00b6 27\n   <em>\n    Speight\n   </em>\n   involved motions in limine raised pretrial that were heard on the first morning of trial, as is commonly the case. But because the trial court wanted to hear and decide the motions while members of the venire filled out jury questionnaires in the courtroom, the motions were heard in chambers. Relocating the hearing was understandable under the circumstances, but hearing motions in limine in chambers is not the norm. More often, as in the trial below, motions in limine raised before trial are taken up by a court at a time when jurors or potential jurors are not present. The arguments therefore can and do take place in an open courtroom.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   \u00b6 28 Turning to the logic prong, the State emphasizes the fact that in this case, as in\n   <em>\n    Smith,\n   </em>\n   the motion in limine addressed a hearsay issue it contends was unlikely to be understood by the public.\n   <em>\n    Smith,\n   </em>\n   however, spoke of discussion of hearsay \"and the prior inconsistent statement exception,\" 181 Wash.2d at 519,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=334%20P.3d%201049\">\n    334 P.3d 1049\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , a more arcane evidentiary issue than those presented here. Based on information gleaned from the CrR 3.5 hearing, the defense motion in limine heard in chambers in this case concerned what would have been pure hearsay coming from Officer Corulli. Only slightly more complex was whether a discussion of the victim's cache of cash that Mr. Karas possibly overheard could be proved with testimony from the victim of statements that were not being offered for their truth. These are issues that an attentive and interested member of the public could grasp, whatever the complexity. Public trust is advanced by giving attentive, interested members of the public the opportunity to know why evidence that seems relevant might be excluded for some countervailing reason.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Smith,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4356663\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/181/508/#p513\">\n    181 Wash.2d at 544\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=334%20P.3d%201049\">\n    334 P.3d 1049\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Owens, J., dissenting) (\"[H]iding discussions over evidence and testimony in private will not further ... goals\" of \"foster[ing] trust in our judicial system, and ... allow[ing] members of the public to see justice done in their communities.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   \u00b6 29 Mr. Karas satisfies us that contested motions in limine that are raised before trial and that can easily be resolved at times when jurors are not present have historically been open to the press and the general public, and that the functioning of evidentiary decision-making is served by allowing public access.

The parties brought and argued the motion at the same time as motions in limine and even frequently, but erroneously, labeled the motion to exclude as a motion in limine.

I therefore concur in the result of the majority.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-110\">\n    Unless otherwise noted, all report of proceedings citations refer to RP (Apr. 14, 2016).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-111\">\n    Having made the motion in limine, his objection was preserved.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-112\">\n    <em>\n     State v.
