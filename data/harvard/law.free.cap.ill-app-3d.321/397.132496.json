In October 1999, the trial court granted defendant\u2019s posttrial motion to set aside the aggravated battery conviction, finding that the State had failed to prove that defendant caused great bodily harm. The court then sentenced defendant to two years in prison on the domestic battery conviction and ordered him to pay $200 for his court-appointed attorney, pursuant to section 113\u20143.1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure of 1963 (Code) (725 ILCS 5/113\u20143.1 (West 1998)).</p> <p id=\"b417-11\" pgmap=\"417\">Defendant appeals, arguing that (1) the State failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he did not act in self-defense; and (2) the trial court erred by (a) admitting into evidence, under section 115\u2014 10.1 of the Code (725 ILCS 5/115\u201410.1 (West 1998)), a tape recording of the victim\u2019s 911 call and a witness\u2019 written statement to the police, and (b) ordering him to pay $200 for his court-appointed attorney. We affirm in part, vacate in part, and remand with directions.</p> <p id=\"b417-12\" pgmap=\"417\">I. BACKGROUND</p> <p id=\"b417-13\" pgmap=\"417(8) 418(102)\">At defendant\u2019s trial, Jesse Fulhlove, defendant\u2019s brother, testified that on the evening of April 16, 1999, he and defendant were playing cards with their sister, May Grayson, at her house. They were playing for money, and Jesse had been winning mor\u00e9 than defendant and May. Around 6 p.m., defendant grabbed Jesse\u2019s money and then Jesse\u2019s nose somehow \u201cgot bumped.\u201d Jesse stated that he could not recall how it happened, although he \u201cmight have bumped [his] nose on the coffee table rail.\u201d He also stated that he had not made any physical contact with defendant prior to his nose being broken. Jesse and May then left to go to the hospital.</p> <p id=\"b418-3\" pgmap=\"418\">After leaving the hospital, Jesse and May went to defendant\u2019s house, where Jesse called 911. Jesse testified as follows regarding his conversation with police on the night of the incident:</p> <blockquote id=\"b418-4\" pgmap=\"418\">\u201cQ. [PROSECUTOR:] What, if anything, did you tell [the police] about your nose?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b418-5\" pgmap=\"418\">A. [JESSE:] My nose was broke[n],</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b418-6\" pgmap=\"418\">Q. Did you tell them how that happened?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b418-7\" pgmap=\"418\">A. I told them how I thought it happened.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b418-8\" pgmap=\"418\">Q. What did you tell them about your nose?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b418-9\" pgmap=\"418\">A. My nose was broken and I told them I thought [defendant] broke it because I wanted my money back.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b418-10\" pgmap=\"418\">Q. How did you tell them your nose was broken?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b418-11\" pgmap=\"418\">A. I told them\u2014I think I told them, [defendant] hit me in the nose.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b418-12\" pgmap=\"418\">* * *</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b418-13\" pgmap=\"418\">Q. And you told the officers that evening that [defendant] hit you in the nose?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b418-14\" pgmap=\"418\">* * *</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b418-15\" pgmap=\"418\">A. I don\u2019t know whether I stated that. I said my nose was broke[n]. I didn\u2019t say he hit me in the nose. I don\u2019t know. I might have. I know when I got to the hospital my nose was broken. I thought it was just bleeding. I didn\u2019t know it was broken.\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b418-16\" pgmap=\"418\">Jesse further testified that on the night of the incident, he gave a signed, written statement to the police but May actually wrote the statement and he signed it without reading it. Th\u00e9 trial court later admitted into evidence Jesse\u2019s statement, which read as follows: \u201cI, Jesse, was over to my sister[\u2019s][;] [defendant] hit me in the nose because I won his money[.] He got mad &amp; upset[.] He said he wasn\u2019t going for that bullshit.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b418-17\" pgmap=\"418\">May testified that on April 16, 1999, her brothers, Jesse and defendant, had a fight at her house because defendant wanted his money back. However, she claimed to be uncertain as to how the fight started or who did what to whom. She testified that during the incident, she was in and out of the room and did not actually see Jesse\u2019s nose being broken. She also stated that defendant was \u201ctossed into a coffee table.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b419-3\" pgmap=\"419\">May also testified that on the night of the incident, she gave a written, signed statement to the police. Over defendant\u2019s objection, the trial court later admitted that statement into evidence. In that statement, May essentially says defendant got upset, cursed, and jumped Jesse.</p> <p id=\"b419-4\" pgmap=\"419\">An emergency room physician testified that on the evening of April 16, 1999, he treated Jesse for a lacerated and broken nose. During this treatment, Jesse told the physician that he was injured when he was punched in the nose during a fight.</p> <p id=\"b419-5\" pgmap=\"419\">Bloomington police officer Tim McCoy testified that around 11 p.m. on April 16, 1999, he responded to a domestic disturbance at defendant\u2019s house. When McCoy arrived, he spoke with Jesse, who told McCoy that defendant hit him in the nose after a dispute over some money. McCoy also spoke with defendant, who told McCoy that he hit Jesse because Jesse grabbed him around the neck. McCoy then arrested defendant and recovered a roll of blood-covered dollar bills. McCoy stated that Jesse then gave a written statement, using a Bloomington police department \u201cvoluntary statement\u201d form. McCoy observed Jesse writing on the form, and McCoy signed the completed statement to acknowledge Jesse\u2019s signature. The prosecutor also showed McCoy photographs that he testified depicted the injuries to Jesse\u2019s nose and the blood on his shirt on the night of the incident.</p> <p id=\"b419-6\" pgmap=\"419\">McCoy also noticed that defendant had scraped knuckles, which defendant told him happened when defendant scraped his knuckles on the ground. McCoy observed no other injuries to defendant.</p> <p id=\"b419-7\" pgmap=\"419\">The trial court then allowed the State to recall Jesse to ask him about the 911 call he made on the night of the incident and to lay a foundation for the introduction of the tape recording of that call. In that tape recording, Jesse said that defendant hit him in the nose and broke his nose.</p> <p id=\"b419-8\" pgmap=\"419\">On this evidence, the jury found defendant guilty of aggravated battery and domestic battery. The trial court later set aside the aggravated battery conviction and sentenced defendant as earlier stated. This appeal followed.</p> <p id=\"b419-9\" pgmap=\"419\">II. ANALYSIS</p> <p id=\"b419-10\" pgmap=\"419\">A. Sufficiency of the Evidence</p> <p id=\"b419-11\" pgmap=\"419\">Defendant first argues that the State failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he did not act in self-defense. We disagree.</p> <p id=\"b419-12\" pgmap=\"419(43) 420(106)\"> Self-defense is an affirmative defense, and once a defendant raises it, the State has the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt .that the defendant did not act in self-defense, in addition to proving the elements of the offense charged beyond a reasonable doubt. (Defendant concedes that the State proved beyond a reasonable doubt that he committed domestic battery. See 720 ILCS 5/12\u2014 3.2(a)(2) (West 1998).) The elements of self-defense are that (1) unlawful force is threatened against a person; (2) the person threatened is not the aggressor; (3) the danger of harm is imminent; and (4) the use of force was necessary. People v. White, 293 Ill. App. 3d 335, 338, 687 N.E.2d 1179, 1181 (1997). If the State negates any one of these elements, the defendant\u2019s claim of self-defense must fail. People v. Shields, 298 Ill. App. 3d 943, 947, 700 N.E.2d 168, 172 (1998).</p> <p id=\"b420-4\" pgmap=\"420\"> The jury, as the trier of fact, determines witnesses\u2019 credibility, draws reasonable inferences from testimony, and resolves conflicts in evidence. A jury therefore need not accept a defendant\u2019s claim of self-defense. People v. Boyd, 307 Ill. App. 3d 991, 995, 719 N.E.2d 306, 309 (1999). \u201cThe standard of review for this issue is whether, taking all of the evidence in the light most favorable to the State, any rational trier of fact could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant did not act in self-defense.\u201d People v. Lee, 311 Ill. App. 3d 363, 367, 724 N.E.2d 557, 561 (2000).</p> <p id=\"b420-5\" pgmap=\"420\">In this case, the only evidence suggesting that defendant acted in self-defense came from Officer McCoy, who testified that on the night of the incident, defendant told McCoy that he hit Jesse because Jesse grabbed him around the neck. May testified that after defendant took the money, both he and Jesse started the fight. However, May acknowledged that on the night of the incident, she gave a written statement to the police, in which she stated that after defendant lost money in a card game, he became upset and \u201cstartled] jumping\u201d Jesse. Jesse testified that after defendant grabbed the money, Jesse \u201cbumped\u201d his nose, although he could not recall how it happened. He also testified that he had not made any physical contact with defendant prior to his nose being broken. Jesse\u2019s testimony regarding his conversation with police on the night of the incident was internally inconsistent. At one point, he acknowledged that he told the police that defendant broke his nose because he wanted his money back but later stated that he could not remember whether that is what he told the police. Jesse\u2019s written statement to the police, which he admitted signing but denied writing, indicated that defendant hit Jesse in the nose after Jesse won defendant\u2019s money. In addition, the medical and photographic evidence reveals that Jesse suffered a lacerated and broken nose. In contrast, defendant was unscathed except for scraped knuckles. The apparent one-sided nature of the struggle supported the State\u2019s theory that defendant did not act in self-defense.</p> <p id=\"b420-6\" pgmap=\"420(24) 421(47)\"> Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the State, we conclude that a rational trier of fact could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant did not act in self-defense, but instead instigated the entire incident or mutually entered into it. See White, 293 Ill. App. 3d at 338, 687 N.E.2d at 1182 (the defense of self-defense is not available when both parties fought willingly upon equal terms).</p> <p id=\"b421-4\" pgmap=\"421\">In so concluding, we note that the only evidence suggesting that defendant acted in self-defense came through the testimony of Officer McCoy when, during the prosecutor\u2019s direct examination, McCoy testified that defendant told McCoy that he hit Jesse because Jesse grabbed him around the neck. McCoy so testified when the prosecutor asked McCoy if defendant told McCoy anything about the incident.</p> <p id=\"b421-5\" pgmap=\"421\">The record reveals no possible benefit to the State from the prosecutor\u2019s eliciting defendant\u2019s self-defense claim through a police officer\u2019s testimony. Had the prosecutor not asked McCoy about defendant\u2019s version of the incident\u2014thus establishing defendant\u2019s self-defense through McCoy\u2019s testimony\u2014defendant would not have been permitted on cross-examination of the officer to elicit the same testimony. That is because, although statements made by a party opponent are admissible as an exception to the hearsay rule if otherwise relevant (People v. Shaw, 278 Ill. App. 3d 939, 951, 664 N.E.2d 97, 105 (1996)), the party himself cannot introduce his prior statements (People v. Patterson, 154 Ill. 2d 414, 452, 610 N.E.2d 16, 33 (1992) (\u201c[s]elf-serving statements by an accused are inadmissible hearsay\u201d)). See also People v. Woods, 292 Ill. App. 3d 172, 178, 684 N.E.2d 1053, 1057-58 (1997) (defendant\u2019s exculpatory statements made to police regarding his alibi constitute inadmissible hearsay); People v. Barnwell, 285 Ill. App. 3d 981, 989, 675 N.E.2d 148, 154 (1996) (criminal defendant\u2019s exculpatory statements made to police constitute inadmissible hearsay, as would be the case with any out-of-court, self-serving declaration by a party not subject to any exception recognized by the hearsay rule); M. Graham, Cleary &amp; Graham\u2019s Handbook of Illinois Evidence \u00a7 802.1, at 753-56 (7th ed. 1999).</p> <p id=\"b421-6\" pgmap=\"421\">In Woods, 292 Ill. App. 3d at 178, 684 N.E.2d at 1058, this court addressed a situation in which the prosecutor pointlessly elicited the defendant\u2019s alibi from a police officer and wrote as follows: \u201cAs a matter of simple trial tactics, trial lawyers\u2014including prosecutors\u2014should ask themselves when conducting direct examination of the witnesses they call, \u2018how does eliciting the following information help my case and damage the other side?\u2019 \u201d Judged according to this standard, it simply makes no sense for a prosecutor to elicit a defendant\u2019s self-defense claim through the State\u2019s own witnesses.</p> <p id=\"b421-7\" pgmap=\"421\">B. Prior Inconsistent Statements As Substantive Evidence</p> <p id=\"b421-8\" pgmap=\"421(11) 422(107)\">Defendant next argues that the trial court erred by admitting into evidence the tape recording of Jesse\u2019s 911 call and May\u2019s written statement. The State responds that the trial court did not err because both the tape recording and the written statement were admissible under section 115\u201410.1 of the Code (725 ILCS 5/115\u201410.1 (West 1998)). The State contends that, under that statute, they were prior inconsistent statements admissible as substantive evidence. Defendant retorts that the State\u2019s argument is faulty because (1) the prosecutor failed to lay the proper foundation regarding Jesse\u2019s 911 call, and (2) May\u2019s statement was not inconsistent with her trial testimony. We agree with defendant regarding Jesse\u2019s 911 call but disagree regarding May\u2019s written statement.</p> <p id=\"b422-3\" pgmap=\"422\"> Section 115\u201410.1 of the Code reads, in pertinent part, as follows:</p> <blockquote id=\"b422-4\" pgmap=\"422\">\u201cAdmissibility of Prior Inconsistent Statements. In all criminal cases, evidence of a statement made by a witness is not made ' inadmissible by the hearsay rule if</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b422-5\" pgmap=\"422\">(a) the statement is inconsistent with his testimony at the hearing or trial, and</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b422-6\" pgmap=\"422\">(b) the witness is subject to cross-examination concerning the statement, and</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b422-7\" pgmap=\"422\">(c) the statement\u2014</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b422-8\" pgmap=\"422\">(1) was made under oath at a trial, hearing, or other proceeding, or</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b422-9\" pgmap=\"422\">(2) narrates, describes, or explains an event or condition of which the witness had personal knowledge, and</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b422-10\" pgmap=\"422\">(A) the statement is proved to have been written or signed by the witness, or</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b422-11\" pgmap=\"422\">(B) the witness acknowledged under oath the making of the statement either in his testimony at the hearing or trial in which the admission into evidence of the prior statement is being sought, or at a trial, hearing, or other proceeding, or</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b422-12\" pgmap=\"422\">(C) the statement is proved to have been accurately recorded by a tape recorder, videotape recording, or any other similar electronic means of sound recording.\u201d 725 ILCS 5/115\u201410.1 (West 1998).</blockquote> <p id=\"b422-13\" pgmap=\"422\">1. Jesse\u2019s 911 Call</p> <p id=\"b422-14\" pgmap=\"422(84) 423(18)\">When Jesse first testified at defendant\u2019s jury trial, his testimony was inconsistent with a written statement he gave to the police on the day in question, and the trial court admitted that written statement into evidence. The court later granted the State permission to recall Jesse to ask him about his 911 call and to lay a foundation for the introduction of the tape recording of that call. When Jesse retook the stand, the prosecutor handed him a tape, People\u2019s exhibit No. 7, which Jesse identified as the tape he had listened to earlier that day. The following colloquy then occurred:</p> <blockquote id=\"b423-3\" pgmap=\"423\">\u201cQ. What is that on that tape?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b423-4\" pgmap=\"423\">A. The call to 911.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b423-5\" pgmap=\"423\">Q. It is a call that you made to 911?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b423-6\" pgmap=\"423\">A. Yeah.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b423-7\" pgmap=\"423\">Q. And it is your voice on that tape?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b423-8\" pgmap=\"423\">A. Yes.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b423-9\" pgmap=\"423\">Q. You recognize your voice on that tape?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b423-10\" pgmap=\"423\">A. Yes, it is.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b423-11\" pgmap=\"423\">Q. And it is a call that you made on April 16, 1999?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b423-12\" pgmap=\"423\">A. Right.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b423-13\" pgmap=\"423\">[PROSECUTOR]: I don\u2019t have any further questions of this witness.\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b423-14\" pgmap=\"423\">When the State then offered exhibit No. 7 into evidence, defendant objected, arguing that the State had failed to present a sufficient foundation. Defense counsel then made the following argument:</p> <blockquote id=\"b423-15\" pgmap=\"423\">\u201cI don\u2019t remember the magic question here[,] \u2018[D]id you tell the dispatcher XY and Z.\u2019 So I don\u2019t see what he\u2019s impeaching yet.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b423-16\" pgmap=\"423\">Even when [Jesse] was on the stand[,] he wasn\u2019t asked, \u2018did you tell *** the 911 dispatcher you got hit in the nose.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b423-17\" pgmap=\"423\">The trial court then listened to the tape itself outside the jury\u2019s presence and made the following ruling: \u201c[T]he court clearly heard where [Jesse] tells the dispatcher [defendant] hit him in the nose and broke his nose. That is inconsistent with his testimony today. State\u2019s [ejxhibit [No.] 7 is admitted over objection.\u201d Defense counsel\u2019s objection was soundly based, and for the reasons that follow, the trial court erred by admitting the tape.</p> <p id=\"b423-18\" pgmap=\"423\"> In People v. Speed, 315 Ill. App. 3d 511, 516, 731 N.E.2d 1276, 1280 (2000), this court pointed out that, to be admissible under section 115\u201410.1 of the Code, a witness\u2019 prior statement must be inconsistent with the witness\u2019 testimony at trial. However, the inconsistency required by section 115\u201410.1(a) must be demonstrated when the witness testifies before the trier of fact, not, as here, when the trial court assesses the statement in question after the witness has completed his testimony and left the witness stand. Laying a sufficient foundation was discussed in People v. Edwards, 309 Ill. App. 3d 447, 457-58, 722 N.E.2d 258, 265-66 (1999) (Steigmann, J., specially concurring), as follows:</p> <blockquote id=\"b423-20\" pgmap=\"423(54) 424(13)\">\u201cLaying the foundation for the admission of a prior inconsistent statement as substantive evidence under section 115\u201410.1 of the Code is essentially the same as laying the foundation to impeach a witness with his prior inconsistent statement. In People v. Hallbeck, 227 Ill. App. 3d 59, 62-63, 590 N.E.2d 971, 972-73 (1992), the Second District addressed the foundational requirements of section 115\u201410.1 and wrote the following:</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b424-3\" pgmap=\"424\">\u2018A proper foundation must be laid before prior inconsistent statements are allowed into evidence. Part of the necessary foundation is asking the witness whether he made the inconsistent statement. [Citations.] Generally, the questioner must direct the attention of the witness to the time, place, and circumstances of the statement and its substance. [Citation.] The witness must have an opportunity to explain the inconsistency before the introduction of extrinsic evidence of the statement; this requirement prevents unfair surprise and gives the witness an opportunity to explain any inconsistency.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b424-4\" pgmap=\"424\">Thus, a key aspect to establishing the foundation for the admissibility of a prior inconsistent statement is the need to confront the witness while on the witness stand with that statement. Thus, in the present case, the prosecutor, after having first called Jesse\u2019s attention to his 911 call, should have asked the following question: \u201cDid you say in that 911 call, \u2018Johnny Grayson busted my nose\u2019?\u201d In response, Jesse might have acknowledged that he did, in which case the State would not be required to later present any extrinsic evidence to complete his impeachment (see section 115\u201410.1(c)(2)(B) of the Code (725 ILCS 5/115\u201410.1(c)(2)(B) (West 1998))). Or, Jesse might have denied making that statement, in which case the State would be required to complete the impeachment (and, concomitantly, the foundation for the statement\u2019s admissibility as a prior inconsistent statement under section 115\u201410.1 of the Code) by presenting extrinsic evidence that Jesse did, in fact, make that statement. In this case, that extrinsic evidence Was the tape recording.</p> <p id=\"b424-5\" pgmap=\"424\">That the prior inconsistent statement at issue here was contained in a tape recording, instead of the more typical situation in which it is contained in a written statement, makes no difference. The rules governing impeachment of a witness with his prior inconsistent statement remain the same.</p> <p id=\"b424-6\" pgmap=\"424(111) 425(40)\"> The procedure described above is the traditional foundation to impeach any witness with his prior inconsistent statement, whether that prior statement is to be offered for substantive purposes or merely for impeachment. As Hallbeck correctly pointed out, this process should be followed for prior inconsistent statements sought to be admitted under section 115\u201410.1 of the Code. Hallbeck, 227 Ill. App. 3d at 63, 590 N.E.2d at 973. Because the State failed to confront Jesse while he was on the witness stand with the prior inconsistent statement he made during the 911 call, the State failed to lay the necessary foundation for the admission of that tape pursuant to section 115\u2014 10.1 of the Code. Specifically, the State did not establish the inconsistency of the statement, within the meaning of section 115\u201410.1(a) of the Code, because Jesse was never confronted with the statement while testifying. 725 ILCS 5/115\u201410.1(a) (West 1998).</p> <p id=\"b425-4\" pgmap=\"425\">One of the important reasons for the requirement that a witness be confronted with his allegedly prior inconsistent statement while still on the witness stand is to provide the opposing party with the opportunity to ask the witness to explain or clarify the inconsistent statement. When a witness is not confronted with his prior inconsistent statement, as occurred here when Jesse was not confronted with the statement he made in the recording of his 911 call, the opposing party is deprived of the opportunity to ask the witness to explain the inconsistency, if he can.</p> <p id=\"b425-5\" pgmap=\"425\">Almost 60 years ago, the Supreme Court of Illinois in People v. Perri, 381 Ill. 244, 249-50, 44 N.E.2d 857, 859 (1942), addressed the procedure to be followed to impeach a witness by his prior inconsistent statement and wrote as follows:</p> <blockquote id=\"b425-6\" pgmap=\"425\">\u201cBefore a witness can be impeached by showing he has made oral statements out of court inconsistent with his testimony, he must be asked as to the time, placet,] and persons involved in the alleged conversation in order that he may be afforded an opportunity to explain it. If the witness denies having made contradictory statements at the time, placet,] and to the person alleged, then the contradictory evidence becomes proper.\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b425-7\" pgmap=\"425\">The State responds to Perri by pointing out that it was rendered long before section 115\u201410.1 of the Code was enacted. True enough, but totally beside the point, given that, as we explained earlier, that section fully incorporates the law regarding the foundation necessary to impeach a witness with his prior inconsistent statement.</p> <p id=\"b425-8\" pgmap=\"425\">We note that the procedure to be employed when the \u201ccontradictory evidence becomes proper,\u201d as the supreme court in Perri termed it, was recently discussed by this court in People v. Burning, 298 Ill. App. 3d 725, 732, 700 N.E.2d 716, 722 (1998), as follows:</p> <blockquote id=\"b425-9\" pgmap=\"425(120) 426(22)\">\u201cIt is generally improper to ask a leading question of your own witness. M. Graham, Cleary &amp; Graham\u2019s Handbook of Illinois Evidence \u00a7 611.9, at 451 (6th ed. 1994). *** Questions that may be answered \u2018yes\u2019 or \u2018no\u2019 are generally considered leading. M. Graham, Cleary &amp; Graham\u2019s Handbook of Illinois Evidence \u00a7 611.9, at 451 (6th ed. 1994). When formulating questions to witnesses to impeach the testimony of another witness, the question should be phrased in such a way as to avoid the possibility of bringing incompetent matters into the trial. A departure from the role against leading questions is required to avoid any improper reference in the answer. M. Graham, R. Steigmann, W. Brandt, &amp; E. Imwinkelried, Illinois Evidentiary Foundations 139 (2d ed. 1997); M. Graham, Cleary &amp; Graham\u2019s Handbook of Illinois Evidence \u00a7 613.3, at 516 (6th ed. 1994).</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b426-3\" pgmap=\"426\">Impeachment of a witness may occur procedurally in a party\u2019s case in chief or in the form of rebuttal. Here the impeachment was in the context of a rebuttal witness for the purpose of proving another witness made a prior statement contrary to the statement testified to. It was proper to ask [the impeaching witness] whether the statement of [the earlier witness] was made to [the impeaching witness] and the answer to be made, yes or no. Where the witness is presented in this context, it is proper to refer to the specific statement in asking for a yes or no answer.\u201d.</blockquote> <p id=\"b426-4\" pgmap=\"426\">Before concluding this discussion, we wish to state our disagreement with the First District Appellate Court\u2019s decision in People v. McDonald, 276 Ill. App. 3d 466, 658 N.E.2d 1251 (1995). In that case, the First District held that a sufficient foundation for the admissibility of a prior inconsistent statement under section 115\u201410.1 of the Code occurred when the witness testified, without more, that he had given earlier statements to investigating police officers. McDonald, 276 Ill. App. 3d at 475-77, 658 N.E.2d at 1256-57. However, the State never confronted the witness with the content of those statements. In dissent, Justice Warren Wolfson wrote that \u201c[t]he operative word in section 115\u201410.1(c)(2)(B) is \u2018acknowledge.\u2019 The witness must \u2018acknowledge\u2019 the words attributed to him by the police officer, not that he made some unspecified statement. Otherwise, the witness\u2019 statement would be whatever the police officer says it is.\u201d (Emphasis added.) McDonald, 276 Ill. App. 3d at 480, 658 N.E.2d at 1259 (Wolfson, J, dissenting).</p> <p id=\"b426-5\" pgmap=\"426\">We agree with Justice Wolfson and note that, in the present case, as in McDonald, Jesse was not specifically confronted with the words of his statement that constituted the alleged inconsistency.</p> <p id=\"b426-6\" pgmap=\"426\">Although we conclude that the trial court erred by admitting the tape recording of Jesse\u2019s 911 call, we do not conclude that this error requires reversal. First, the tape recording was largely cumulative of Jesse\u2019s other properly admitted prior inconsistent statements. Second, the only argument against the overwhelming nature of the State\u2019s evidence is defendant\u2019s claim that the State failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he did not act in self-defense. However, we earlier concluded that this argument was groundless. Accordingly, the evidentiary error that the trial court committed by admitting Jesse\u2019s 911 call into evidence does not require reversal. People v. Thomas, 178 Ill. 2d 215, 235-36, 687 N.E.2d 892, 901 (1997); People v. Saunders, 220 Ill. App. 3d 647, 659, 580 N.E.2d 1246, 1255 (1991).</p> <p id=\"b427-2\" pgmap=\"427\">2. May\u2019s Written Statement</p> <p id=\"b427-3\" pgmap=\"427\">Next, defendant argues that the trial court erred by admitting May\u2019s written statement under section 115\u201410.1(a) of the Code because it was not inconsistent with her trial testimony. 725 ILCS 5/115\u201410.1(a) (West 1998). Specifically, he contends that May\u2019s written statement that he \u201cstart[ed] jumping\u201d Jesse had no tendency to contradict May\u2019s trial testimony that he \u201cstarted a fight.\u201d Defendant thus asserts that, because \u201c[t]hese two statements were, in fact, completely consistent with each other[,] [ajdmission of the written statement *** was an abuse of discretion.\u201d We disagree.</p> <p id=\"b427-4\" pgmap=\"427\">In People v. Flores, 128 Ill. 2d 66, 87-88, 538 N.E.2d 481, 489 (1989), the supreme court held that determining whether a prior statement is inconsistent within the meaning of section 115\u201410.1 of the Code, so as to be admissible as substantive evidence, rests within the trial court\u2019s sound discretion. Thus, the issue now before us is whether the trial court abused its discretion by concluding that May\u2019s written statement to the police was inconsistent with her testimony at trial, so as to be admissible as substantive evidence under section 115\u201410.1 of the Code.</p> <p id=\"b427-5\" pgmap=\"427\">The entirety of May\u2019s written statement at issue is the following: \u201c[Defendant] lost some money in a card game[,] got mad &amp; upset[,] cursing[;] say [sic] he isn\u2019t going for this bullshit and start[ed] jumping Jesse Fullilove.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b427-6\" pgmap=\"427\"> When called as a witness at trial, May admitted that she did not want to testify against her brother, and her testimony at trial was equivocal. She claimed to be in the kitchen during almost the entire fight and expressed uncertainty as to who started it. She also claimed that she did not hear defendant say anything other than to ask for his money back.</p> <blockquote id=\"b427-7\" pgmap=\"427\">\u201c[A] witness\u2019 prior testimony does not need to directly contradict testimony given at trial to be considered \u2018inconsistent,\u2019 as section 115\u201410.1 of the Code uses that term. In People v. Flores, 128 Ill. 2d 66, 87, 538 N.E.2d 481, 488 (1989), quoting United States v. Williams, 737 F.2d 594, 608 (7th Cir. 1984), the supreme court held that the term \u2018inconsistent\u2019 in section 115\u201410.1 is not limited to direct contradictions but also includes \u2018 \u201cevasive answers, *** silence, or changes in position.\u201d \u2019 \u201d People v. Edwards, 309 Ill. App. 3d 447, 458, 722 N.E.2d 258, 266 (1999) (Steigmann, J., specially concurring).</blockquote> <p id=\"b427-8\" pgmap=\"427(49) 428(75)\">See also People v. Salazar, 126 Ill. 2d 424, 458, 535 N.E.2d 766, 780 (1988) (\u201c[i]n some circumstances, *** a mere tendency to be inconsistent will be enough to admit the statements into evidence and in other circumstances more than a mere tendency would be needed to admit the statements\u201d); People v. Fields, 285 Ill. App. 3d 1020, 1028, 675 N.E.2d 180, 185 (1996) (following Salazar\u2019s analysis and holding that the statements at issue were sufficiently inconsistent to be admissible under section 115\u201410.1 of the Code); People v. Lee, 243 Ill. App. 3d 745, 749, 612 N.E.2d 922, 924 (1993) (inconsistency under section 115\u201410.1 of the Code does not require a direct contradiction, but only a tendency to contradict the witness\u2019 present testimony).</p> <p id=\"b428-3\" pgmap=\"428\"> Judged in accordance with the foregoing authority, we conclude that the trial court in this case did not abuse its discretion by concluding that May\u2019s written statement was sufficiently inconsistent with her trial testimony so as to be admissible as substantive evidence under section 115\u201410.1 of the Code.</p> <p id=\"b428-4\" pgmap=\"428\">C. Payment Order</p> <p id=\"b428-5\" pgmap=\"428\"> Last, defendant argues that the trial court erred by ordering him to pay $200 for his court-appointed attorney without first holding a hearing to determine his ability to pay pursuant to section 113\u2014 3.1(a) of the Code (725 ILCS 5/113\u20143.1(a) (West 1998)) and People v. Love, 177 Ill. 2d 550, 687 N.E.2d 32 (1997).</p> <p id=\"b428-6\" pgmap=\"428\">The State concedes that the payment order should be vacated because the trial court failed to conduct a section 113\u20143.1(a) hearing and requests that this court remand this cause for such a hearing. We accept the State\u2019s concession and grant its request for a remand. Accordingly, we vacate the court\u2019s $200 payment order and remand the cause for a hearing pursuant to section 113\u20143.1 of the Code. In doing so, we are following this court\u2019s action in People v. Williamson, 319 Ill. App. 3d 891, 900 (2001), which we acknowledge appears to be inconsistent with this court\u2019s previous decision in Speed, 315 Ill. App. 3d at 518, 731 N.E.2d at 1281, regarding the appropriateness of a remand for a hearing pursuant to section 113\u20143.1 of the Code. Upon further reflection, we decline to follow that portion of Speed.</p> <p id=\"b428-7\" pgmap=\"428\">III. CONCLUSION</p> <p id=\"b428-8\" pgmap=\"428\">For the reasons stated, we affirm in part, vacate in part, and remand with directions.</p> <p id=\"b428-9\" pgmap=\"428\">Affirmed in part and vacated in part; cause remanded with directions.</p> <p id=\"b428-10\" pgmap=\"428\">KNECHT, J., concurs.</p> </opinion> <opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\"> <author id=\"b428-11\" pgmap=\"428\">JUSTICE COOK,</author> <p id=\"Aff\" pgmap=\"428\">dissenting.</p> <p id=\"b428-12\" pgmap=\"428\">I respectfully dissent and would reverse.</p> <p id=\"b428-13\" pgmap=\"428(13) 429(25)\">If there are three witnesses in a criminal case, and they all testify that defendant did not commit the offense, can the jury, taking into account the witnesses\u2019 reluctance to testify, disbelieve them and find the defendant guilty?</p> <p id=\"b429-3\" pgmap=\"429\">First of all, I disagree that this was a mutual combat situation where the defense of self-defense was not available. \u201cA person is justified in the use of force when and to the extent that he reasonably believes that such conduct is necessary to defend himself against the imminent use of unlawful force.\u201d Illinois Pattern Jury Instructions, Criminal, No. 24\u201425.06 (4th ed. 2000) (hereinafter IPI Criminal 4th). \u201cA person who has not initially provoked the us\u00e9 of force against himself has no duty to attempt to escape the danger before using force against the aggressor.\u201d IPI Criminal 4th No. 24\u201425.09X. An initial aggressor, a person who initially provokes the use of force against himself, is justified in the use of force only if he (1) reasonably believes he is in imminent danger of death or great bodily harm and has exhausted all other means to escape or (2) indicates clearly his withdrawal but the other person continues the use of force. IPI Criminal 4th No. 24\u201425.09.</p> <p id=\"b429-4\" pgmap=\"429\">There is no right of self-defense in a mutual combat situation. Where two individuals in a bar agree to step outside and fight, either or both may be charged with battery. The fact that one of them strikes the first blow does not give the other the right to respond. The agreement to fight constitutes a provocation to the use of force, making each party an initial aggressor. See IPI Criminal 4th No. 24\u201425.09. Both fighters are guilty of battery unless one of them qualifies to use force as an initial aggressor. See State v. Allred, 129 N.C. App. 232, 235, 498 S.E.2d 204, 206 (1998) (if a person voluntarily enters into a fight he cannot invoke the doctrine of self-defense unless he withdraws from the fight and notifies his adversary that he has done so). There is no evidence the individuals here agreed to enter into a fight. The evidence is that there was a dispute over money which led to blows being struck.</p> <p id=\"b429-5\" pgmap=\"429(132) 430(17)\">Jesse testified that he and defendant were playing cards, that Jesse had been winning, that defendant grabbed his money, that Jesse wanted his money back, that an altercation ensued, and his nose was broken by defendant, perhaps when Jesse fell against the coffee table rail. Jesse testified he had not made any physical contact with defendant prior to his nose being broken. (What physical contact did he make? When did he make it? How did he go about getting his money back? Why would defendant, who had the money, strike Jesse?) Jesse told the investigating officer that defendant hit him in the nose after a dispute over some money. At trial, Jesse testified that he did not know how his nose was broken, that May had written his statement for him, and that he signed the statement because he was mad at defendant and wanted his money back.</p> <p id=\"b430-3\" pgmap=\"430\">May testified that her brothers, Jesse and defendant, had a fight because defendant grabbed the money, that she thought Jesse made the first contact in the fight, that defendant was tossed into a coffee table, and that she did not see Jesse\u2019s nose being broken. May testified that both Jesse and defendant started the fight. May testified she gave a written statement to police in which she stated that, after defendant lost money in a card game, he became upset and \u201cstartled] jumping\u201d Jesse.</p> <p id=\"b430-4\" pgmap=\"430\">The investigating officer, McCoy, testified that defendant told him that he hit Jesse because Jesse grabbed him around the neck.</p> <p id=\"b430-5\" pgmap=\"430\">The majority complains that \u201cthe only evidence suggesting that defendant acted in self-defense came from Officer McCoy.\u201d 321 Ill. App. 3d at 402. The more appropriate question is, what evidence was there that defendant did not act in self-defense? The fact that a fight occurred is not evidence there was no self-defense. Once a defendant raises self-defense as an affirmative defense, the State has the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant did not act in self-defense. People v. Jeffries, 164 Ill. 2d 104, 127-28, 646 N.E.2d 587, 597-98 (1995). Where there is no evidence one way or the other, the State loses. While credibility of a witness is within the province of the trier of fact and the finding of the jury on such matters is entitled to great weight, the jury\u2019s determination is not conclusive. Rather, we will reverse a conviction where the evidence is so unreasonable, improbable, or unsatisfactory as to justify a reasonable doubt of defendant\u2019s guilt. People v. Smith, 185 Ill. 2d 532, 541-42, 708 N.E.2d 365, 369-70 (1999); People v. Minniweather, 301 Ill. App. 3d 574, 577-78, 703 N.E.2d 912, 913-14 (1998); People v. De Oca, 238 Ill. App. 3d 362, 367-68, 606 N.E.2d 332, 336 (1992) (question whether defendant was the initial aggressor).</p> <p id=\"b430-6\" pgmap=\"430(149) 431(64)\">What was the evidence that defendant was the aggressor? Defendant took the money Jesse had won from defendant. Jesse tried to get it back. Even if Jesse\u2019s testimony is believed, that he had not made any physical contact before his nose was broken, that testimony does not establish that Jesse was not the initial aggressor. Even the mere utterance of words may be enough to qualify one as an initial aggressor. People v. Dunlap, 315 Ill. App. 3d 1017, 1025-26, 734 N.E.2d 973, 981 (2000). The fact that defendant took the money, and the fight would not have happened if he had not done so, does not make defendant the initial aggressor. Not every utterance of words or other conduct that results in a fight makes one the initial aggressor. Where a victim tells defendant to stop and that she is going to call the police, those actions do not make the victim the initial aggressor. Dunlap, 315 Ill. App. 3d at 1025-26, 734 N.E.2d at 981. Defendant\u2019s taking his money back, accomplished by grabbing it, did not give Jesse the right to use force. The majority\u2019s complaint that Jesse\u2019s testimony was \u201cinternally inconsistent\u201d does not aid the State. 321 Ill. App. 3d at 402. Jesse was the State\u2019s witness.</p> <p id=\"b431-4\" pgmap=\"431\">The majority\u2019s argument, that \u201c[t]he apparent one-sided nature of the struggle supported the State\u2019s theory that defendant did not act in self-defense\u201d (321 Ill. App. 3d at 402), is simply grasping for straws. The victim of an attack may land a blow that ends the attack. The most that can be said about this case is that we do not know whether defendant or Jesse was the aggressor. We do not know whether defendant reasonably believed his conduct was necessary to defend himself against the imminent use of unlawful force. The evidence was not sufficient to disprove self-defense beyond a reasonable doubt.</p> <p id=\"b431-5\" pgmap=\"431\">Nor does May\u2019s prior statement that defendant became upset and \u201cstart[ed] jumping\u201d Jesse provide any assistance to the State. The evidence indicated that defendant was upset about Jesse winning his money and that defendant grabbed the money. The words, \u201cstart[ed] jumping\u201d Jesse, do not add anything to that, particularly in light of May\u2019s testimony at trial. Again, the State has impeached its own witness here. The fact that May\u2019s prior inconsistent statement is admissible substantively under section 115\u201410.1 does not mean that that statement is accurate or must be accepted over the testimony that May presented at trial. The State\u2019s evidence is so unreasonable, improbable, or unsatisfactory in this case that there is a reasonable doubt of defendant\u2019s guilt.</p> <p id=\"b431-6\" pgmap=\"431\">Section 115\u201410.1 is useful to prevent State\u2019s witnesses from disavowal of their statements made during the pretrial investigation of the case, which statements may have been very thorough and specific. Section 115\u201410.1 should not be used in a case where there is little or no evidence, in an attempt to bolster weak evidence by repetition, even where the witness is an unwilling one. Where not even the victim is willing to testify that a crime has occurred, it is difficult to see how the State has proved its case beyond a reasonable doubt.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
