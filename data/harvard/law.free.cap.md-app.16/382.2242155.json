The record clearly shows that the trial judge carefully explained to the accused his constitutional right against compulsory self-incrimination; his right to trial by jury, and his right to be confronted by his accusers, as required by <em>Boykin v. Alabama, </em>395 U. S. 228, 23 L.Ed.2d 274. It also affirmatively appears that the plea of guilty was entered by the accused intelligently and voluntarily in all requirements enunciated in <em>McCall v. State, </em>9 Md. App. 191, and <em>Williams v. State, </em>10 Md. App. 570, but for the single exception that the accused was not advised of the possible consequence of such a plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">This Court, speaking through Chief Judge Murphy, in <em>Duvall v. State, </em>5 Md. App. 484, raised storm signals of warning in announcing to the trial courts that the record must make an affirmative showing \u201c* * * particularly as to the length of the sentence that could be imposed upon him by the court.\u201d In <em>Mathews v. State, </em>15 Md. App. 686,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> we traced the decisional history of <em>Duvall v. State, supra, </em>and reviewed every published opinion of this Court pertaining to a guilty plea, and at page 692 declared :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-6\">\u201cBefore a plea of guilty is accepted, the record should clearly show compliance with <em>Boykin, McCall </em>and <em>Williams. </em>It should also demonstrate that the accused knows the length of the maximum sentence that the trial court can impose for the offense or offenses.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b405-7\">We reiterate our holding in <em>Mathews </em>that these are inflexible requirements, the absence of any of which will require reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-8\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b405-9\">\n<em>Case remanded for a new trial.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b405-10\">\n<em>Mandate to issue forthwith.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b405-11\">.
