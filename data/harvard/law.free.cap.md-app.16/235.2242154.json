Ciarrocchi, Assistant State\u2019s Attorney for Prince George\u2019s County, </em>on the brief, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b258-12\">Thompson, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"ABU\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-13\">Kevin Joseph Barber and others were jointly indicted by the Grand Jurors of Prince George\u2019s County, for crimes which occurred during his alleged participation in the armed robbery of a small liquor store. The case against Barber was severed, removed and tried by a jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>in the Circuit Court for Calvert County, Judge Perry G. Bowen presiding. The foreman of the jury announced the verdict \u201cguilty of armed robbery with a dangerous weapon, and guilty of first degree murder with a request for clemency.\u201d For the homicide Barber was sentenced to serve the rest of his natural life, and for the other conviction, 20 years to run concurrently with the life sentence. Barber appeals alleging the trial judge committed reversible error by denying his motion for mistrial due to newspaper publicity which appeared during trial, in that the judge failed to examine the newspaper articles as to whether or not they were \u201cprejudicial or inflammatory per se.\u201d Secondly, he alleges error was committed by the failure \u201cto examine the jurors individually rather than <em>en mass </em>in respect\u201d to their knowledge of the newspaper articles. Lastly, he alleges that the jurors\u2019 finding of \u201cguilty of armed robbery with a dangerous weapon,\u201d makes this conviction a nullity as he was not indicted for armed robbery but rather \u201cattempted robbery with a deadly weapon.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">The evidence presented by the prosecution was uncontroverted. Appellant was identified by Mrs. Ethel Kid-well as the one of the \u201cboys\u201d who entered the package liquor store operated by her and her husband and drew a pistol while announcing \u201cthis is a holdup.\u201d In an ensuing gun battle the would-be robbers shot and killed Warner Giles Kidwell, but fled without taking anything.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">\n<em>Publicity</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b259-7\">The second morning of the two-day trial, appellant\u2019s counsel moved for a mistrial based on two newspaper articles that had appeared \u201cin the metropolitan Washington newspapers\u201d the previous day. The actual articles are not in the record apparently because they have been lost. It has been stipulated that defense counsel\u2019s summary of the articles to the trial court was a fair statement of their context. On appeal counsel referred to three pretrial newspaper stories, but under the rules only what he presented to the trial judge is before us. One front <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>page article was entitled \u201cProbation for a Youth in Robbery Stirs Debate\u201d; it reported the disposition of the case against one of those jointly indicted with appellant. The article indicated that there were co-defendants involved, but it does not appear from the record that appellant was mentioned by name. An evening newspaper carried an article entitled \u201cYouth Given Probation in Fatal P. G. Robbery.\u201d This article reported about the crimes and the disposition of the cases against two of the defendants. The article was apparently embellished with some comments by the State\u2019s Attorney for Prince George\u2019s County on the propriety of the probationary sentencing in view of the seriousness of the offenses. Appellant\u2019s counsel alleged this article mentioned that \u201ctwo other eighteen year olds who are charged with the actual attempted holdup and shooting are scheduled to go on trial today in Calvert County.\u201d Relating the facts of one article, appellant\u2019s counsel asserted \u201cthat article went on to say . . . Kevin Joseph Barber, has a murder charge pending against him, and is scheduled to be tried Monday in Calvert County. Then it goes on with a further lengthy explanation, also involving the State\u2019s Attorney for Prince George\u2019s County, on whether or not the sentence [of a co-defendant] was proper in view of the seriousness of the offense. . .</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">Prior to allowing the jury to separate for luncheon recess the first day of the trial, the judge admonished them to neither engage in nor overhear conversations concerning the case. At the end of the first day and prior to their evening separation, this admonition was reiterated and supplemented with a direction not to \u201cread any possible account of the trial today in any newspapers or any other form of printed material, nor are you to listen to anything over the radio about it. Any time you hear anything that leads you to believe that it might be connected with this case, have nothing to do with it.\u201d Court was then adjourned for the day. The first order of business the next morning was appellant\u2019s motion for mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>The trial judge posed to the jury as a body this question: \u201cMr. Foreman, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, before this case commenced yesterday, you ladies and gentlemen were sworn on the voir dire. I want to ask you now, on the basis of that oath, and I want you to answer me frankly and honestly without any worry of reprisals, whether any of you ladies and gentlemen read any newspaper articles reported about this case, or heard any reports or comments about this case over last night\u2019s recess.\u201d Immediately afterward the court reporter has inserted \u201c(The jury indicated a negative response.)\u201d The trial judge then denied the motion for mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">The general rule concerning prejudicial publicity as stated by the Court of Appeals of Maryland is \u201cthe burden is upon the party alleging prejudice to show: (1) that the newspaper article is prejudicial (2) that a juror has read the prejudicial newspaper article, and (3) that the jurors\u2019 decision at the trial was influenced by that newspaper article.\u201d <em>Presley v. State, </em>224 Md. 550, 555, 168 A. 2d 510, cert. den. 368 U. S. 957, 82 S. Ct. 399, 7 L.Ed.2d 389. See also <em>Graef v. State, </em>1 Md. App. 161, 228 A. 2d 480 and <em>Sizemore v. State, </em>5 Md. App. 507, 248 A. 2d 417. If we assume the articles were prejudicial it is obvious the appellant failed to satisfy requirements (2) and (3) and the trial judge committed no error in denying the motion for mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">Appellant argues the trial judge was required under <em>Basiliko v. State, </em>212 Md. 248, 129 A. 2d 375, to read the articles and determine whether or not the articles were prejudicial <em>per se. </em>Appellant misreads <em>Basiliko. </em>The convictions in that case were reversed because during a criminal trial, the publishing and broadcasting media gave massive coverage to a civil suit brought by the well-known Chief Judge of the same circuit in which the criminal trial was being held; the civil suit was based upon the assumption of the truth of the allegations which constituted the ultimate issue in the criminal trial. In <em>Basiliko </em>there was no showing that any juror had been exposed to those announcements; however, based upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>its peculiar facts, the Court inferred that the jurors had been exposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">Appellant also makes reference to <em>Sheppard v. Maxwell, </em>384 U. S. 333, 86 S. Ct. 1507, 16 L.Ed.2d 600, to support his argument. In that case where the publicity was so \u201cmassive, pervasive and prejudicial\u201d that it \u201cinflamed and prejudiced the public,\u201d the Supreme Court presumed jury prejudice and reversed a criminal conviction. The publicity in these two cases bears no resemblance to the publicity shown by the two articles involved in the instant case. Nor would the publicity be in any way comparable if we were to consider the other articles referred to above but not officially before us. In order for the precedents of <em>Basiliko </em>and <em>Sheppard </em>to be invoked, the publicity must be so massive that it permeates the entire community. If two newspaper articles published during the course of a criminal trial could result in presumed jury prejudice, few jury trials could be completed. Appellant has cited no authority nor are we aware of any which requires that a trial judge make a finding as to whether or not publications relating to a criminal trial \u201cwere inflammatory and prejudicial per se.\u201d His denial of the motion for mistrial in the instant case amounted to a finding that no jury prejudice had been shown and we agree with his finding. See <em>Raimondi v. State, </em>12 Md. App. 322, 278 A. 2d 664 (cert. granted on other grounds 265 Md. 229, 288 A. 2d 882).</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">\n<em>Examination of Jurors</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b262-7\">Appellant\u2019s trial counsel made a timely general objection \u201cto any questions being asked by the court,\u201d but on appeal he claims only that the trial court abused its discretion by posing the question to the jury as a whole rather than individually. Appellant urges, as he did at trial, that human behavior be taken into consideration, and concludes that in light of the admonition not to read newspapers that the tendency of the jurors would be to deny they had read the articles.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-8\">To support his argument appellant cites <em>Seidman v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number><em>State, </em>230 Md. 305, 187 A. 2d 109 and <em>Veney v. Warden, </em>251 Md. 159, 246 A. 2d 608, but we fail to see such support. In the first case the trial judge questioned jurors on <em>voir dire </em>as a group, in the second they were questioned individually. We see nothing in either opinion which would indicate that either method is improper. See <em>Connor v. State, </em>225 Md. 543, 171 A. 2d 699, which specifically approved questioning jurors as a group. While we recognize the difference between questioning jurors prior to the time they are sworn and questioning them during a trial, <em>Basiliko v. State, supra, </em>we see no prejudice to the appellant in the instant case due to the cautious manner in which the trial judge handled the situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">\n<em>Verdict</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">When the jury declared that they had reached their verdict and had appointed their foreman to speak for them, the clerk asked \u201cWhat say you, is Kevin Joseph Barber guilty of the matter for which he stands indicted, or not guilty?\u201d The transcript shows the foreman replied in part with the following redundancy, \u201cGuilty of armed robbery with a dangerous weapon, . . . .\u201d The clerk compounded the error when he said, \u201cLadies and gentlemen of the jury, harken to your verdict as the Court has recorded, that you find Kevin Joseph Barber . . . guilty of armed robbery.\u201d No response from the jury is transcribed but the court immediately thanked the jury and dismissed them. No objection to the form of the verdict was raised below.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-7\">It is elementary that a judgment based on a jury\u2019s verdict of guilty of a crime for which the prisoner was never accused is invalid. <em>Turner v. State, </em>242 Md. 408, 219 A. 2d 39. We think it clear from the record in this case that the jury intended no such verdict. See <em>Pettiford v. State, </em>8 Md. App. 560, 569, 261 A. 2d 216.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-8\">Of the four counts of the indictment against appellant, only the second pertains to robbery; it reads in part \u201c[appellant] unlawfully did attempt with a dangerous <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>and deadly weapon to rob Ethel Sarah Kidwell . . . and violently did attempt to steal from her . . .\u201d This charge, as well as the others, was read in its entirety to the jurors. In his opening argument the State\u2019s Attorney advised \u201cLadies and gentlemen of the jury, the case that you have before you today is a murder, attempted armed robbery case.\u201d In his charge to the jury, the trial court stated, \u201cNow, the second count which will be submitted to you charges the offense of attempted robbery with a deadly weapon . . . the crime charged ... is not to complete the robbery, but to attempt to rob.\u201d All of the testimony showed the robbery was not accomplished and there is no reference to an actual or completed robbery anywhere in the record except, of course, in the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">When viewed in the light of these circumstances, as required by <em>Pettiford, supra, </em>it is clear that the redundancy was unintentional and that the substitution of the word \u201carmed\u201d for \u201cattempted\u201d was inadvertent. The error committed was one of form only and \u201cwhere the meaning of the verdict is so unmistakable, mere inartificiality in its form will not be sufficient to defeat justice by a nullification of a verdict which plainly declared the intent of the jury. . . .\u201d <em>Simmons v. State, 165 </em>Md. <em>155, </em>169, 167 A. 60. The very purpose of language is to express ideas; when the language used unmistakably expresses a conclusion, technicalities in the form of the verdict cannot be used to invalidate that verdict. The docket entry as recorded correctly reflects the jury\u2019s verdict, \u201cOn 2nd. Count Defendant Barber GUILTY of attempted robbery with a deadly weapon.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
