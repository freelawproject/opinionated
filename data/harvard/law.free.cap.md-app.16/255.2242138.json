Powers of their \u201cMotion To Quash Pending Charges\u201d, in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-18\">We shall dismiss the appeal on the ground that it is an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>interlocutory order and the appeal has been prematurely taken. Rule 1087.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">We glean from the record that the only question presented to Judge Powers on the \u201cMotion To Quash\u201d was the alleged failure of the State to comply with the provisions of the Interstate Detainer Act, codified as Md. Ann. Code, art. 27, \u00a7\u00a7 616A-R. Appellants\u2019 attack was, therefore, made upon the statutory right to be tried within a specified time as distinguished from the constitutional right to a speedy trial. Sixth Amendment, Constitution of the United States; Art. 21, Maryland Declaration of Rights. Of course, an order denying a motion grounded \u00f3n the constitutional right to a speedy trial is immediately appealable. <em>Raimondi v. </em>State, 8 Md. App. 468, 261 A. 2d 40 (1970) ; <em>King v. State, </em>5 Md. App. 652, 249 A. 2d 468 (1969). An appeal from a denial of the statutory right to be tried within the specified time under Art. 27, \u00a7 616A-R must await final judgment. Rule 1087; Md. Ann. Code Art. 5, \u00a7 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">\n<em>Appeal dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
