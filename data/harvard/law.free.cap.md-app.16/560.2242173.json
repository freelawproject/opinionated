The two-pronged test of <em>Aguilar </em>established constitutional guidelines for measuring hearsay information in a probable cause setting (either as predicate for a warrant or for acting, under appropriate circumstances, without a warrant) . The \u201cbasis of knowledge\u201d prong requires of him who would act upon hearsay, a knowledge \u201cof some of the underlying circumstances\u201d upon which the informant based his conclusion. The \u201cveracity\u201d prong is in the alternative. It requires of him who would act upon the hearsay, a knowledge of \u201csome of the underlying circumstances\u201d which leads to the conclusion that the informant is 1) \u201ccredible or 2) his information reliable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b584-11\">Most of the case law treats exclusively of the \u201ccredibility\u201d aspect of the \u201cveracity\u201d prong. In <em>Dawson v. State, </em>14 Md. App. 18, 35 (concurring opinion), we despaired at the failure of the Supreme Court to make clearer the meaning of the phrase \u201cor his information reliable\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-12\">\u201cThe intrinsic approach to veracity is an alter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>native one in that <em>Aguilar </em>commands that the magistrate \u2018be informed of some of the underlying circumstances from which the officer concluded that the informant\u2019 was \u2018credible\u2019 OR \u2018his information reliable.\u2019 The Supreme Court, ironically, has never discussed the impact of the language, \u2018or his information reliable.\u2019 Arguably, supporting facts which show that an informant\u2019s information is \u2018reliable\u2019 thereby show also that the informant is, on that occasion at least, \u2018credible.\u2019 Unless the alternative phraseology is meaningless, the informant\u2019s \u2018credibility\u2019 would seem to involve his inherent and ongoing character as a person \u2014 his reputation and demonstrated history of honesty and integrity. Informational \u2018reliability,\u2019 as something separate from its source\u2019s credibility, would seem to involve some circumstances assuring trustworthiness on the particular occasion of its being furnished. Although hypothetical examples are difficult to conjure up in the context of police informers, it would certainly follow that any circumstance qualifying as a trustworthy exception to the hearsay rule in a trial setting would, <em>a fortiori, </em>qualify in a probable cause setting. Fortunately, it is not this aspect of <em>Aguilar\u2019s </em>veracity prong which is before us in the case at bar.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">This aspect of <em>Aguilar\u2019s </em>\u201cveracity\u201d prong is now before us. The present case, by way of illustration, will help to fill that former void.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">The appellant, Guy Charles Thompson, Jr., was convicted in the Criminal Court of Baltimore by Judge J. Harold Grady, sitting without a jury, of possession of heroin. He was sentenced to a prison term of four years. On December 22, 1970, the appellant was arrested in his automobile and the automobile was searched. The search uncovered a brown paper bag containing 143 glassine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>bags of heroin. The conviction rises or falls on the legitimacy of that automobile search, which is the sole issue presented by the appellant on this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">Counsel have been helpful in narrowing the issue. It is agreed that we are dealing with a warrantless search of the appellant\u2019s automobile under the so-called \u201cautomobile exception\u201d to the warrant requirement. It is further agreed that there is no problem as to exigency. The only issue is whether Officer Donald Schline of the Narcotics Unit of the Baltimore City Police Department had probable cause to believe that the automobile contained evidence of narcotics violations. The adequacy of that probable cause, in turn, depends upon whether Officer Schline was entitled to credit certain hearsay information.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-6\">At approximately 12:30 p.m. on December 22, 1970, Officer Schline received information from one of his regular informants, which precipitated his search of the appellant\u2019s automobile within the hour. Officer Schline furnished to the trial court a substantial basis for believing in the credibility of this regular informant. The appellant agrees that the credibility of this primary informant is established beyond dispute. The rub is that this credible, primary informant passed on to Officer Schline information which he had, in turn, received from another unnamed person. We are dealing with hearsay twice compounded. We are dealing with the type of problem referred to in <em>Dawson v. State, </em>11 Md. App. 694, 701, n. 3, although we were discussing it there in a search warrant setting:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-7\">\u201cIf the informant himself is offering not direct observation but hearsay twice compounded, the entire evaluation process must begin again at a second level of remoteness. The primary informant must then pass along sufficient data in sufficient detail so that the magistrate may again judge for himself 1) the credibility of the secondary informant and 2) the worth of that sec\u00f3n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>dary informant\u2019s information. If, in some extreme hypothetical situation, the secondary informant should be a mere conduit for hearsay thrice compounded from a tertiary informant, the evaluation process is escalated to yet another level of remoteness and so on ad infinitum. <em>Spinelli, </em>at 416 (majority opinion by Harlan, J.) and 423-425 (concurring opinion by White, J.). Ultimately, the magistrate must have the benefit of someone\u2019s first-hand observation in order to evaluate the worth of the information and must have also satisfactory proof of the credibility of every person involved in the chain of transmission of the information from the initial observer to the magistrate himself.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b587-7\">The credibility of the primary informant \u2014 Officer Schline\u2019s regular informer \u2014 is granted. That credibility is indispensable, since the primary informant is a conduit for the information from its more remote source back to Officer Schline. The credibility of that primary informant is not enough, however, since he is but the conduit. In addition, Officer Schline must have had, and must have passed on to the trial court, a basis for crediting that more remote, secondary informant. <em>Kapler v. State, </em>194 Md. 580, 587-588; <em>Bolesta v. State, </em>9 Md. App. 408, 412-416; <em>Mullaney v. State, </em>5 Md. App. 248, 252-256. With this analysis in mind, we look to the events of December 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-8\">Officer Schline\u2019s informant was, or posed as, a narcotics addict and regular purchaser of narcotic drugs. During the late morning of December 22, he went to the 700 block of Newington Avenue to buy from his seller some drugs, which he intended to pass on to Officer Schline. This unidentified seller, who is the secondary informant now under analysis, informed his purchaser that he did not then have any drugs to sell. He urged his purchaser to return at around 1 p.m. He indicated that he would then have drugs to sell \u201cwhen Guy made the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>drop.\u201d A \u201cdrop\u201d is a recognized term in the jargon of the junkie for a delivery of drugs by an upper-echelon distributor to a street dealer.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">From his own knowledge, the primary informant \u2014 Officer Schline\u2019s regular informer \u2014 was able to specify that \u201cGuy\u201d was the appellant Guy Thompson and that he would be driving a 1965 Pontiac with Maryland tag number FG 5147. The primary informant\u2019s own information, however, went only to the identity of \u201cGuy\u201d and not to his anticipated criminal activity at or about 1 p.m. on December 22. That information came only from the more remote, secondary informant. With respect to that secondary informant, it is agreed that he spoke from first-hand knowledge. <em>Aguilar\u2019s </em>\u201cbasis of knowledge\u201d prong is not in issue. Our single problem is to measure this secondary informant \u2014 this unnamed street seller\u2014 against <em>Aguilar\u2019s </em>\u201cveracity\u201d prong. Was there reason to believe that he was \u201ccredible\u201d or that his information was \u201creliable?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">In terms of our now classical mode of measuring an informant by the credibility aspect of <em>Aguilar\u2019s </em>\u201cveracity\u201d prong, this unnamed street seller could not pass the test. Officer Schline did not know who he was or anything at all about him. No information was furnished as to whether the street seller had ever passed on information before, which had turned out to be correct. His inherent credibility \u2014 his integrity \u2014 his status as a truth speaker \u2014is a total and unrelieved mystery. This aspect of traditional Aguilarian analysis yields absolute zero.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-7\">The \u201cveracity\u201d prong of <em>Aguilar </em>is, however, significantly phrased in the disjunctive. Even knowing nothing about the inherent credibility of a source of information, we may still ask, \u201cWas the information furnished under circumstances giving reasonable assurances of trustworthiness?\u201d If so, the information is \u201creliable,\u201d notwithstanding the ignorance as to its source\u2019s credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-8\">Although the rationale was not always neatly pigeonholed for convenience of later analytic synthesis, and al<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>though additional reasons based on practical necessity were sometimes advanced, the decisions of the Court of Appeals and of this Court have long portended that hearsay information may be furnished under circumstances reasonably insuring its reliability, even absent any knowledge as to its source\u2019s credibility. <em>Jones v. State, </em>242 Md. 95, 100-101 (reliable information furnished by a rape victim, a named witness, and several other unidentified witnesses) ; <em>Taylor v. State, </em>238 Md. 424, 429-431 (reliable information furnished by an unidentified witness to a robbery) ; <em>Evans v. State, </em>11 Md. App. 451, 455-459 (reliable information furnished by an unknown robbery victim) ; <em>Ward v. State, </em>9 Md. App. 583, 590-592 (reliable information furnished by two cleaning maids at a motel who observed narcotics in a motel room) ; <em>Knight v. State, </em>7 Md. App. 282, 285-286 (reliable information furnished by two witnesses to a crime) ; <em>Edwards v. State, </em>7 Md. App. 108, 112, f. 1 (reliable information furnished by one confessing to a crime, in the course of which confession he implicated another) ; <em>Grimm v. State, </em>6 Md. App. 321, 326-328 (reliable information furnished by a taxicab driver) ; <em>Boone v. State, 2 </em>Md. App. 80, 93 (reliable information furnished by one confessing to a crime, which confession implicated another).</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">We believe a like reasoning to apply to the unnamed street seller at bar. Though- from the criminal milieu, to be sure, he was not, wittingly at least, working with the police. He was not in the position of \u201cthe common informant. . . hidden behind a cloak of anonymity\u201d who more often than not \u201cis paid or provides information in exchange for immunity from prosecution for his own misdeeds.\u201d <em>People v. Glaubman, </em>485 P. 2d 711, 716-717 (Colorado, 1971). This street seller was, so far as he knew, engaged in a purely commercial venture for his own profit. He was dealing with a regular and presumably valued customer. Being unable initially to satisfy his customer\u2019s demand, it was to his every advantage to assure the prompt return of that customer as soon as fresh merchandise was available for sale. He simply had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>no purpose in misleading his own clientele. The circumstances in which the seller passed on the information to a customer and confidant are replete, we think, with reasonable assurances of trustworthiness. Upon our constitutionally-mandated independent review, we believe the information furnished by this secondary informant to have been reliable, notwithstanding his utter lack of demonstrated credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-4\">Believing the reliability of the information to have been intrinsically established by the circumstances in which it was transmitted, it is unnecessary to recite several other items of Officer Schline\u2019s own knowledge and direct observation which would have lent extrinsic support, were such extrinsic support necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b584-14\">. <em>Aguilar v. Texas, </em>378 U. S. 108.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
