This appeal from an order of 25 April 1972 of the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County requires interpretation of \u00a7\u00a7 10 and ll.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">As reenacted by Acts 1966, Ch. 591, \u00a7 10 of Art. 24 applies to the circuit courts of all of the counties of this State and to the civil common-law and equity courts of Baltimore City.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> It provides in subsection (a) that the clerks of such courts \u201cshall not docket any suit or issue process in any original suit, matter, proceeding or action at law until the plaintiff, or someone in his behalf, shall first deposit with the clerk of the court in which such suit, matter or proceeding shall be brought, toward the payment of the costs of the clerk and sheriff for which the plaintiff is liable\u201d certain specified sums. It seems that it is concerned with the initiation of an action and the Court of Appeals has found that the legislative intent was probably twofold \u2014 \u201cthe discouraging of frivolous litigation and assuring payment of at least a part of the costs should the plaintiff be the losing party.\u201d <em>Glanville v. David Hairstylist, </em>249 Md. 162, 166. The costs so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>assured are sums specified in \u00a7 10 (a) for the clerk for docketing the suit, matter or proceeding \u2014 \u201cthe sum of $10 for any law case and $15 for any equity case,\u201d and the costs of the sheriff for issuing process in any original suit, matter, proceeding or action at law for which the plaintiff is liable, see Code, Art. 36, \u00a7\u00a7 25, 25A, 25B, 26, 26A, 26B.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">Section 11 of Art. 24, as amended by Acts 1968, ch. 184, also deals with the prepayment of costs for docketing a case at law or in equity, but is limited in its application to specified counties. \u201cNo case at law or in equity shall be docketed in the circuit court of Anne Arundel, Harford, Montgomery, Charles, St. Mary\u2019s, Somerset, Worcester and Prince George\u2019s counties * * * until the clerk of the circuit court shall have been paid the costs therefor; * * <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In this respect, as to the counties specified, it covers the same ground as does \u00a7 10 without specifying the sum to be deposited. Section 11 does not include certain costs of the sheriff but does include other matters which \u00a7 10 does not. Section 11 further provides: \u201cnor shall any attachment, writ of fieri facias or execution on judgment be issued until the costs therefor shall have been paid to the said clerk.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b354-9\">Each of \u00a7 10 and \u00a7 11 provides an exception. Section 10 (b) reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-10\"><em>\u201cException when petitioner not able to make deposit. </em>\u2014 Such deposits need not be made by any person, who by petition under oath filed in such suit, matter or proceeding or action at law, shall satisfy the judge thereof that the petitioner is not able to make such deposit, and whose coun<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>sel shall certify that the petitioner\u2019s said suit, matter, proceeding or action at law is meritorious, in which event the court shall pass an order allowing process to be issued and action taken without such deposit.\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">Section 11 has this proviso:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-7\">\u201c* * * provided, however, that the provisions of this section shall not apply to any indigent plaintiff, or to any person unable to pay the costs of docketing any said case or the issuance of any attachment, writ of fieri facias or execution on judgment as provided herein.\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b355-8\">In \u00a7 10 the legislature has made clear the procedure with respect to the required deposit. Process may be issued and \u201caction taken\u201d without prepayment of costs only by order of the court. The court shall pass such order, (1) upon the filing of a petition sufficient to satisfy the court that the petitioner is unable to make the required deposit, and (2) upon certification of the petitioner\u2019s counsel that the suit is meritorious.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Thus the test is whether the person desiring to have the case docketed and process issued is unable to make the required deposit. When the petition and certification have been properly submitted, the deposit may be excused upon the court being satisfied that the petitioner is unable to make it. This determination is a matter of judicial discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>Section 11 asserts baldly that its provisions \u201cshall not apply to any indigent plaintiff, or to any person unable to pay\u201d the prescribed costs.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> It spells out no procedure for the determination of indigency or inability to pay. We believe that the legislature intended that the determination of whether a person was indigent or unable to pay the costs was within the sound discretion of the court. However, with respect to the docketing of a case, which is covered by \u00a7 10 as to all counties and Baltimore City and also by \u00a7 11 with respect to certain counties, we think that the clerk\u2019s costs for docketing cases at law and in equity in the circuit courts for the counties and in the civil common-law courts and equity courts of Baltimore City and the procedure under which exception is to be made to the prepayment requirement, are to be in accordance with the clear and specific provisions of \u00a7 10. We note that the title to ch. 591, Acts 1966, states that \u00a7 10 was repealed and reenacted with amendments \u201cto provide that court costs be uniform throughout the State.\u201d <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Therefore, a person seeking to have a case docketed at law or in equity without prepayment of costs must file a petition under oath sufficient to satisfy the judge that the petitioner is unable to make the required deposit and the petitioner\u2019s counsel must certify that the suit is meritorious.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">Nellie Wigginton presented to the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County for docketing a bill of complaint <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>for a divorce a vinculo matrimonii against her husband, Frank Clark Wigginton, address unknown. She submitted a \u201cPetition to Waive Payment of Fees and Costs,\u201d alleging that she was without sufficient funds to pay \u201cthe filing fees, sheriff fees, cost of publication and other costs which may be involved in this litigation,\u201d that she was a recipient of Medical Assistance and that she had been assigned counsel under the Maryland Legal Services Program (Judicare). She asserted that other than her personal clothing and effects she had no assets, and unless granted leave to file the action without payment of fees and costs, \u201cshe will be unable to present what she feels is meritorious litigation to the Court.\u201d She attached a financial statement under oath showing income of $200 from Federal Aid to Dependent Children and an amount of $108 in United States Department of Agriculture Food Stamps. Whether this is weekly or monthly income is not indicated. The expenses, again with no indication of whether weekly or monthly, are listed as rent \u2014 $180; food \u2014 $100; light, gas, telephone $28. We view the income and expenses as being on a monthly basis. The liabilities are shown as $700 owed to Hecht Co. It appears from the record before us that the final action taken by the Master for Domestic Relations Causes, Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County, was set forth in a Memorandum dated 11 April 1972 by him to Mrs. Wigginton\u2019s counsel:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-5\">\u201cThe Petition for Waiving Pre-Payment of Court Costs has come to the Master for review and recommendation, and I am returning the file herewith as it is not clear why the plaintiff is not employed. She states that she is an indigent and it occurs to me that if she had a job she might not be an indigent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-6\">It is common knowledge that a great segment of the population would perhaps be indigent if they did not work.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b357-7\">Counsel excepted. Praying that his exceptions be sustained, he claimed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>\u201cThe finding of indigency has already been made by the fact that the Plaintiff is receiving assistance from Federal Aid to Dependent Children and food stamps from the United States Department of Agriculture. The Plaintiff also has been granted a Medical Assistance Card by the Government which is No. 16035337340, and has been assigned Counsel under the Maryland Legal Services Program (Judicare).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">He asserted: \u201cTo deny the Plaintiff the right to have her case filed with prepayment of costs waived defeats the whole purpose of the Judicare Program, and would appear to be in violation of the Supreme Court\u2019s Mandate in <em>Boddie v. Connecticut, </em>91 S. Ct. 780.\u201d On 25 April 1972, the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County passed an order as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-6\">\u201cUpon consideration of the Report of the Master, dated the 11th day of April, 1972, and the Exceptions filed thereto, it is, by the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County, Maryland, Sitting in Equity, this 25th day of April 1972,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-7\">ORDERED, That the Exceptions be, and the same hereby are overruled, and it is further</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-8\">ORDERED, That the Clerk shall not receive the case of <em>Wigginton v. Wigginton </em>for filing, waiving payment of fees and costs.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b358-9\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b358-10\">We first observe that it is patent that appellant in seeking to have her case docketed without making the deposit did not invoke the statutory exceptions available. Rather she relied on the holding in <em>Boddie v. Connecticut, </em>401 U. S. 371. In <em>Boddie </em>the Court assumed, as there it had to, \u201cthe truth of the undisputed allegations made by the appellants.\u201d It pointed out:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-11\">\u201cThere is no dispute as to the inability of the named appellants in the present case to pay <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>either the court fees required by statute or the cost incurred for the service of process. The affidavits in the record establish that appellants\u2019 welfare income in each instance barely suffices to meet the costs of the daily essentials of life and includes no allotment that could be budgeted for the expense to gain access to the courts in order to obtain a divorce. Also undisputed is appellants\u2019 \u2018good faith\u2019 in seeking a divorce.\u201d At 372-373.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">The holding in <em>Boddie </em>was precise:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-6\">\u201cOur conclusion is that, given the basic position of the marriage relationship in this society\u2019s hierarchy of values and the concomitant state monopolization of the means for legally dissolving this relationship, due process does prohibit a State from denying, solely because of inability to pay, access to its courts to individuals who seek judicial dissolution of their marriages.\u201d At 374.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b359-7\">And the Court made clear that its holding was limited:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-8\">\u201cIn concluding that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment requires that these appellants be afforded an opportunity to go into court to obtain a divorce, we wish to reemphasize that we go no further than necessary to dispose of the case before us, a case where the <em>bona fides </em>of both appellants\u2019 indigency and desire for divorce are here beyond dispute. We do not decide that access for all individuals to the courts is a right that is, in all circumstances, guaranteed by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment so that its exercise may not be placed beyond the reach of any individual, for, as we have already noted, in the case before us this right is the exclusive precondition to the adjustment of a fundamental human relationship.\u201d At 382-383.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b360-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>The statutes of this State on the subject are in nowise at odds with <em>Boddie. </em>Under them if a person establishes that he is unable to pay the required costs and his counsel certifies that the cause is meritorious, he obtains his day in court. Certainly <em>Boddie </em>mandated no more.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">We cannot say on the record before us that the judge below abused his judicial discretion in not being satisfied by appellant\u2019s petition that she was not able to make the deposit. He was not bound by the findings of governmental agencies, whatever those findings may have been. Nor did it necessarily follow that because appellant was receiving assistance from Federal Aid to Dependent Children and food stamps from the United States Department of Agriculture and granted a Medical Assistance Card and assigned counsel by Judicare that she was in fact unable to make the deposit. The Master\u2019s unanswered question as to why appellant was not employed was important to a determination of her ability to pay. (According to the Bill of Complaint there were two children, Erie born 28 May 1956 and Daniel born 29 July 1959). We understand from oral argument before us that appellant and counsel were tendered an opportunity to appear before the Master to explain why she was not employed and to offer such other matters pertaining to her inability to pay as they desired, but refused, preferring to rely on the petition. We think it a perfectly proper procedure for the court, itself or through a Master, to conduct such hearing as may provide relevant and material data on the issue. And we observe that counsel did not comply with the mandate of Code, Art. 24, \u00a7 10 (b) that he certify that the suit was meritorious. On the record before us we find no error in the court refusing to pass an order allowing action to be taken without the deposit.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">Our holding does not constitute a final determination that appellant may not file her suit without prepayment of costs. We note that she may still invoke the statutory exceptions, and if, upon compliance with the statutory requirements, she satisfies the judge below that she is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>able to make the deposit, an order allowing action to be taken without such deposit would be proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-4\">\n<em>Order of 25 April 1972 affirmed.</em>\n<footnotemark>\n<em>9</em>\n</footnotemark>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b353-6\">. Code, Art. 24, \u00a7 12 (Acts 1961, ch. 673) authorizes the judges of the Circuit Court for Baltimore County to adopt and enforce rules requiring and regulating the prepayment of costs of cases at law or in equity docketed in said court, and prepayment of costs for the issuance of attachments, writs of fieri facias or execution on judgment. The judges are further authorized to adopt \u201cany exceptions to said rules which they may deem appropriate in the interest of justice.\u201d Under this authority Rule 100 of the Third Judicial Circuit was adopted. Section a provides that no case shall be docketed until advance costs have been paid to the clerk in amounts provided by law and made the Rule applicable to the issuance of writs of attachment on judgment, fieri facias or execution on judgment. Section b sets out five cases to which the Rule does not apply. Section c states: \u201cPrepayment of costs shall not be required in any case in which a plaintiff or petitioner executes an affidavit of indigency.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b353-7\">Whether \u00a7 12 of Art. 24 was repealed by implication upon the repeal and reenactment with amendments of \u00a7 10 of Art. 24 by Acts 1966, ch. 591, effective 1 June 1966, is not before us.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b353-8\">. The original of what is now \u00a7 10 was enacted by Acts 1943, ch. 759. It applied to certain designated counties and to the civil common-law courts of Baltimore City. Acts 1966, ch. 591 added the equity courts of Baltimore City and eliminated the subsection which made the section applicable only in Baltimore City and specified counties. Ch. 591 also repealed Art. 26, \u00a7 31, subheading, \u201cCosts for docketing cases in certain counties.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b354-11\">. The section also requires the prepayment of costs to the clerk of the circuit court \u201cin the first and second judicial circuits\u201d with respect to \u201cany appeal from any people\u2019s court or magistrate court on any civil case\u201d before such proceeding be docketed by the circuit court. Section 11 was repealed and reenacted with amendments by Acts 1972, ch. 181, \u00a7 21. As rewritten it contains four subsections. Subsection (c) reads: \u201cNo civil appeal from the District Court may be docketed in any circuit court or in the Baltimore City Court until the costs have been paid to the clerk of the appellate court pursuant to the Maryland Rules.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b355-9\">. Section 10 (c) provides that such deposits shall not be required to be made in proceedings in the nature of an appeal to the common-law courts of Baltimore City to have reviewed any decision of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Commission and in appeals from judgments rendered by the People\u2019s Court. Acts 1972, ch. 181, \u00a7 21 deleted from subsection (c) that such deposits were not required in appeals from judgments rendered by the People\u2019s Court. See note 3, <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b355-10\"><em>. </em>The exception in the statute as rewritten by Acts 1972, ch. 181, is set out in subsection (d): \u201cThis section does not apply to an indigent plaintiff, or to any person unable to pay the costs of docketing a case or of issuing an attachment, writ of fieri facias, or execution on judgment.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b355-11\">. There are provisions in \u00a7 10 (b) making any wilful false swearing punishable as perjury under the criminal laws of Maryland.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b356-7\">. Section 10 does not use the word \u201cindigent\u201d but we feel that in the frame of reference of the two sections it was the legislative intent that there be no distinction between an \u201cindigent plaintiff\u201d and a person unable to pay the docketing costs. In any event, any distinction in this context would seem to be artificial and to no real purpose. \u201cIndigent\u201d means \u201clacking means of substance; impoverished; needy.\u201d The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b356-8\">. The legislature may desire to reconsider Art. 24, \u00a7\u00a7 10, 11 and 12 so that the matters now contained in the three statutes could be covered in one comprehensive law. This could do much to further the uniformity throughout the State as to payment of costs which the legislature sought.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b361-12\">. By order of 15 May 1972 this Court ordered that its Clerk accept the appeal without the payment of appeal costs.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
