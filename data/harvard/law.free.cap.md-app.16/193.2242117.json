The indictment presented related offenses set out in six additional counts. John Mahoney was separately tried by a jury in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County. On 14 June 1968 he was convicted under the 1st count and sentenced to 20 years.* <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On direct appeal from that judgment, he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>claimed only that the indictment was defective because of a misjoinder of counts. Finding no merit in that contention, we affirmed the judgment. <em>Mahoney v. State, </em>6 Md. App. 407.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">John Mahoney had the assistance of counsel for his defense at his trial, but he now feels that his counsel was incompetent. Collaterally attacking the judgment, he presented the point in a petition for relief under the Post Conviction Procedure Act, complaining that his counsel failed to call on his behalf witnesses who would have testified that he was home at the time the crime was committed. Following an evidentiary hearing, at which Mahoney and his trial counsel both testified, the court concluded that trial counsel had been incompetent and ordered a new trial. The State filed an application for leave to appeal from that determination. We obtained and reviewed a copy of the transcript of the trial and of the post conviction hearing. We set out what they disclosed in an unreported per curiam opinion filed 17 April 1972, docketed as <em>State v. Mahoney, </em>No. 123, Post Conviction, September Term, 1971.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">At John Mahoney\u2019s trial, Michael Breuer, Manager of McDonald\u2019s Restaurant on Rockville Pike, testified that he was held up at gunpoint at approximately 1:00 a.m. or 1:30 a.m. on August 11, 1967 by three masked men as he was leaving the store. He was forced back into the restaurant, the safe was opened and a large sum of money was stolen. Breuer was unable to identify any of the masked robbers.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-7\">Steven Wilson, who resided near Mahoney\u2019s home, testified that he, together with John Mahoney and his brother Will Mahoney, held up Breuer at the restaurant. He said that they walked to McDonald\u2019s, ate there, and then went behind the restaurant and put on face masks. Thereafter, John Mahoney forced Breuer at gunpoint to lie on the floor of the restaurant, emptied the safe of its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>money, and ripped the phone from the wall. They all then ran away on foot, after which they divided the stolen money and John threw the gun under a nearby bridge.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">Charles Van Hoozier, also a neighbor of the Mahoney family, testified that shortly after the robbery John Ma-honey came to his home and said he had committed a robbery at McDonald\u2019s Restaurant. Van Hoozier then accompanied Mahoney to Gaithersburg where Mahoney purchased a car with part of the stolen money. Van Hoozier testified that Mahoney gave money to him to supply him with an alibi. He also admitted hiding in his house money stolen in the robbery. It was subsequently recovered by police who conducted a search of Van Hoozier\u2019s house with his permission.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">Lonzy Walters, Mahoney\u2019s uncle, testified that on the evening following the robbery, Mahoney came to his home; that Will Mahoney and his wife were also present; that they all went riding in John Mahoney\u2019s car, at which time John Mahoney said he had committed a robbery at McDonald\u2019s Restaurant in Rockville; that they had worn masks over their faces and had taken $1400.00. Walters notified the police and John and Will Mahoney were later arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-7\">Both John and Will Mahoney confessed their participation in the robbery to the police shortly after their arrests. In John Mahoney\u2019s statement, he admitted participating in the robbery with his brother Will and Steven Wilson. He admitted using a gun which he later threw under a bridge. He said they arrived at McDonald\u2019s at approximately midnight, having walked there from his home. He said they used masks over their faces and that after committing the crime, they returned home.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"ADz\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>Evidence was adduced at the trial showing that the robbers\u2019 masks were found near the scene of the crime; that the gun was found under a nearby bridge; that Mahoney had purchased a car immediately after the robbery and, when arrested, had $139.00 in his possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">Mahoney offered no evidence in his defense and the jury found him guilty of armed robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">At the post conviction hearing, Mahoney contended that his trial counsel was incompetent \u201cdue to the fact that he failed to call to the stand any witnesses on * * * [his] behalf, even though such witnesses were readily available * * * and could afford testimony to the fact that * * * [he] was at his legal place of residence, 13817 Travilah Road, Rockville, Maryland, during the time that the crime that he is presently incarcerated for was committed.\u201d Mahoney testified that his father, mother, sister, brother, and sister-in-law would have so testified had they been called as witnesses at the trial, but that trial counsel refused to call these witnesses although requested both prior to and during the trial without assigning any reason for his decision. Mahoney also contended that a gas station attendant named Jim and a friend, Sue Evans, would have testified in support of his alibi, but trial counsel refused to call them as witnesses although requested to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-7\">It was Mahoney\u2019s testimony that he was in bed at 12:30 a.m. on the day of the crime; that his mother and father were also in bed at that time; that his mother was a light sleeper and would have heard him if he drove away from the house. He said his brother Elwood slept in the same bedroom with him and would provide \u201can alibi\u201d that he was at home when the crime was committed; that when he (Mahoney) went to bed that night, Elwood was still awake and they talked before retiring. Mahoney further testified that his sister Barbara Ann would have testified that she had seen him \u201cthat night,\u201d and that his brother Perry would have testified that he saw him working on his car on the night of the crime. Ma-honey testified that had Sue Evans been called as a wit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>ness, she would have said that on the night of the crime he had changed some of his money into dollar bills, later found on him when he was arrested; and that the gas station attendant Jim would have testified that he (Ma-honey) was working on his car at 10:30 p.m. that night.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">Mahoney\u2019s mother testified at the post conviction hearing that at 12:30 a.m. on the day of the crime, \u201cas far as I know,\u201d her son was at home. She said he had worked on his car earlier that night and came home around 10.30 p.m. She said she didn\u2019t recall when she went to bed that night, although she thought it was around midnight, but that her son was still up when she retired. She testified that had her son driven away from the house that night, she would have heard him leave.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">Mahoney\u2019s sister-in-law (Will\u2019s wife) testified that she saw him at home at 11:30 p.m. on the night of the crime. She also testified that she and her husband went to bed at 11:00 p.m. that night.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-7\">Mahoney\u2019s trial counsel, John Bell, testified at the post conviction hearing that he knew that Mahoney\u2019s relatives were prepared to testify to \u201csome type of alibi for him at the time that this alleged offense was to have taken place.\u201d Bell said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-8\">\u201c* * * this presented a difficult situation for the defense attorney or any defense attorney but I think it is abundantly clear that while a defense attorney is an instrumentality by which the defendant\u2019s case is presented to the jury and to the Court, the defense attorney cannot take the facts of a case and change them substantially, nor can a defense attorney in any way participate in a fraud upon the Court or lend himself to any perjury or subordination of perjury from the defendant or any other witnesses and for that reason Will Smith Mahoney having indicated to me that he and his brother had done this, I don\u2019t believe that John Mahoney had told me of his involvement, actually admitted it, al<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>though it was abundantly clear from all of the evidence, it seemed appropriate to me as a tactical maneuver not to protect for the record everything that had been admitted into evidence, to protect all of the exceptions and objections that had been made and to stand on the record as it was and not to bring any fabrication or lies or any other false, spurious, counterfeit facts before the Court or before the jury.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">Bell testified that Will Mahoney had admitted to him committing the crime and implicated John. Bell said he interviewed all witnesses that Mahoney asked him to interview; that he didn\u2019t recall their names but thought the mother and other relatives were among such prospective witnesses. Asked by the court whether he declined to call alibi witnesses because he thought such witnesses would be lying, Bell answered in the affirmative, and said he so told Mahoney. The court then asked:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-6\">\u201cAre you the judge? Are you supposed to make that judgment as to whether or not their testimony would be perjured?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b221-7\">Bell responded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-8\">\u201cYour Honor, I don\u2019t know whether I am the judge or not but if one of the defendants has admitted to me that he had committed the offense and if in interviewing all of the State\u2019s witnesses, including the relatives, would lead a reasonable person to believe that the testimony would be false \u2014 .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b221-9\">The court rejoined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-10\">\u201cIsn\u2019t the jury the judge? Isn\u2019t the jury entitled to hear the testimony of the defendant\u2019s witnesses and then reach its own judgment as to who is telling the truth and who isn\u2019t?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b221-11\">Bell answered:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-12\">\u201cI would take the position that I am not going <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>to put on any witnesses, including the defendant, who I think is going to give perjured testimony.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">The court granted Mahoney a new trial. It stated that under Maryland law \u201cfailure to call witnesses, going to the competency of counsel,\u201d is a ground upon which post conviction relief may be granted if it amounts \u201cto more than a tactical judgment and it must amount to depriving * * * the defendant at his trial of due process.\u201d The court found as a fact that Bell\u2019s reason for not calling Mahoney\u2019s alibi witnesses was because he thought \u201cthey would be lying\u201d and Bell \u201cdidn\u2019t want to be part of it.\u201d The court also found as a fact that Mahoney asked Bell to summons his mother, father, sister, a brother, his sister-in-law, the gas station attendant and Sue Evans, but that Bell refused to call them as witnesses. The court said that Mahoney\u2019s testimony was that his brother Elwood, had he been called as a witness, would have testified that Mahoney was either in bed or asleep at about the time the crime was committed. The court summarized the post conviction testimony of Mahoney\u2019s mother and sister-in-law; it noted that while neither could testify where Mahoney was \u201cat precisely the time when the alleged offense was committed,\u201d their testimony at the trial \u201cwould have had some probative value.\u201d The court held that Mahoney \u201chad a constitutional right to have his so-called alibi witnesses present, and if he insisted upon it, to have them take the stand and to have the jury, not the lawyer, decide whether their testimony was credible or not.\u201d The court concluded that Bell\u2019s failure to accede to Mahoney\u2019s wish \u201cto have his alibi witnesses testify for him * * * deprived * * * [him] of due process\u201d; that if Bell \u201cdidn\u2019t like the way his client was insisting that the case be tried, he should have withdrawn his appearance, should have petitioned the Court to relieve him of the obligation to defend.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">The State applied for leave to appeal. It claimed that due process of law was not offended by Bell\u2019s failure to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>call the so-called alibi witnesses to testify at the trial. The State maintained that \u201cthe authorities are legion which hold that the failure or neglect of trial counsel in calling or not calling witnesses, even if material, does not aiford grounds to support a claim of inadequate representation.\u201d The State contended that the \u201ccalling of different witnesses is a matter of trial tactics and even if the tactics prove to be wrong, a denial of the right to * * * [competent] counsel * * * is not shown short of a clear allegation and proof of a factual situation showing that the representation of counsel reduced the trial to a farce or sham.\u201d Of course, as we pointed out in our opinion of 17 April 1972, the State\u2019s reliance upon the \u201cfarce or sham\u201d test was misplaced; that test for assessing the constitutional adequacy of trial counsel is no longer the law of this State. See <em>Slater v. Warden, </em>241 Md. 688, and <em>Green v. Warden, </em>3 Md. App. 266, noting, as indicated <em>infra, </em>that the proper test for determining the competency of trial counsel is whether, under all the circumstances of the particular case, counsel was so incompetent that the accused was not afforded genuine and effective legal representation.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">The State also contended in its application that the so-called alibi witnesses would not have assisted Mahoney in his defense because their testimony would not have established Mahoney\u2019s whereabouts at the time the crime was committed.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">Responding to the State\u2019s application for leave to appeal, Mahoney acknowledged that while there was an overwhelming amount of evidence pointing to his guilt, most of it was elicited from alleged participants in the crime and from his own statement, which he denied making. He claimed that at the end of the State\u2019s case, \u201cthere could have been no question that the jury would convict\u201d; that his only possibility of escaping a conviction was to produce alibi witnesses; and that whether such witnesses were to be believed was a matter solely for the jury. Mahoney argued that Bell\u2019s decision not to call witnesses was by no stretch of the imagination \u201ctrial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>tactics.\u201d He claimed that \u201cthere was nothing to lose and conceivably much to gain by placing a doubt as to the credibility of the State\u2019s witnesses in the minds of the jury\u201d; and argued that the testimony of the alibi witnesses \u201cat the very least creates an inference that he was in bed at the time the offense was committed.\u201d Mahoney concluded by urging that Bell\u2019s refusal to call his alibi witnesses amounted to a denial of due process of law and correspondingly amounted to incompetence on trial counsel\u2019s part.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">Because we felt that the issues presented were \u201cof far-reaching importance,\u201d we granted leave to appeal, transferred the case to our regular appeal docket and directed that it be fully briefed and orally argued before us on two questions which we posed as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-6\">\u201c(1) Whether, in the circumstances of this case, Mahoney\u2019s Fourteenth Amendment rights to the effective assistance of counsel and to due process of law were denied him by reason of Bell\u2019s refusal to call the so-called alibi witnesses to testify on his behalf at the trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-7\">(2) Whether, in the circumstances of this case, viewed in light of the provisions of Maryland Rule BK45 directing that the post conviction hearing judge \u2018make such order on the petition as justice may require,\u2019 Bell\u2019s refusal to call the alibi witnesses justifies the granting of a new trial.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b224-8\">The State maintains that Mahoney\u2019s trial counsel acted properly in not calling the alleged alibi witnesses and that even if the failure to call them was error, the error was harmless. Mahoney claims that as his counsel was \u201cobligated to present all evidence available to [his] defense, which was of probative value, unless he knew that such evidence was perjured,\u201d the failure to do so was error and that the error was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">We find that trial counsel\u2019s refusal to call the alibi witnesses did not require the grant of a new trial in the interest of justice. In so concluding we assume, <em>arguendo, </em>that the refusal to call the witnesses was an improper exercise of judgment. But even if it were improper, we believe that the impropriety was not such as to deny Mahoney the effective assistance of counsel or due process of law. Thus it provides no ground for the invoking of Rule BK45 to grant a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">Mahoney does not dispute the sufficiency of the evidence to establish the <em>corpus delicti </em>of the crime; his contention runs to the proof of his criminal agency. He asserts that his father, mother, sister, brother, sister-in-law, a gas station attendant named Jim, and a friend, Sue Evans, would each have testified that he was elsewhere when the robbery was committed, thus refuting that he participated in the commission of the robbery. However, at the post conviction hearing, of all the alleged alibi witnesses, he offered only his mother and sister-in-law. His mother, asked if she had any recollection where John Edward Mahoney was on 11 August 1967 at 12:30 a.m.,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> said, \u201cHe was at home as far as I know.\u201d The transcript reads:</p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">\u201c[by Mahoney\u2019s counsel]</p>\n<p id=\"b225-8\">Q. What makes you say that?</p>\n<p id=\"b225-9\">A. He was working on his car; before that time, before he, when he came home he, I didn\u2019t know him to go back out again.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-10\">Q. What time did he come home after working on his car?</p>\n<p id=\"b225-11\">A. I think it was around until 10:30 somewhere around in there. It has been so long ago, I don\u2019t remember, but he came home from working on his car.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-13\">Q. 10:30 at night?</p>\n<p id=\"b226-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>A. Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">Q. Where did he go when he came home?</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">A. He didn\u2019t go out any more as I know of.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-7\">Q. What time did you go to bed that evening, the evening of the 10th of August; do you recall?</p>\n<p id=\"b226-8\">A. No, I don\u2019t.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-9\">Q. Do you recall whether he was still up when you went to bed or\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b226-10\">A. He was still up when I went to bed.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-11\">Q. He was still up when you went to bed, and whether he went at 8:00 o\u2019clock at night or 7:00 o\u2019clock\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b226-12\">A. He was working on his car.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-13\">Q. Were you up when he came home?</p>\n<p id=\"b226-14\">A. Yes, I was.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-15\">Q. And you think that was about the time?</p>\n<p id=\"b226-16\">A. I think around 10:30, 11:00, I don\u2019t know exactly; it has been so long ago, my memory is not too good.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-17\">* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b226-18\">Q. When was the next time you saw your son, John after, say, you went to bed on the evening of August 10, 1967? Did you see him the next morning or not?</p>\n<p id=\"b226-20\">A. Yes, sir.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-21\">Q. Where did you see him the next morning?</p>\n<p id=\"b226-22\">A. He was home.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-23\">Q. Where did you see him, in bed or at breakfast or where?</p>\n<p id=\"b226-24\">A. At breakfast.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-25\">Q. What time was that, approximately?</p>\n<p id=\"b226-26\">A. I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b226-27\">Upon inquiry by the court it was elicited that when the mother went to bed \u201cabout midnight\u201d Mahoney was still there. He had an automobile he could drive. She supposed she would have heard \u201cthat automobile if it had left.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b227-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>Mary Helen Mahoney <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> was John Mahoney\u2019s sister-in-law (she was married to Will Smith Mahoney) and first cousin. At the hearing she was examined by the court. She said that on 10 and 11 August 1967 she was living at 13817 Travilah Road with her mother-in-law and father-in-law. John Mahoney was also living at that same house then. The transcript reads:</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">\u201cQ. Do you have any recollection of having seen John Edward Mahoney on the evening of August 10 or the early morning of August 11, 1967?</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">A. Yes, sir.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-7\">Q. Tell me when you saw John Edward Ma-honey. Was it on the evening of August 10, 1967?</p>\n<p id=\"b227-8\">A. I saw him that night and also that morning.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-9\">Q. And where did you see him that night and what time that night did you see him?</p>\n<p id=\"b227-10\">A. It was about 11:30 that night that I saw him.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-11\">Q. Where did you see him?</p>\n<p id=\"b227-12\">A. At home.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-13\">Q. Had he been at home all that evening or had he been out part of the evening?</p>\n<p id=\"b227-14\">A. Him and my husband both went out working on his car that night.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-15\">Q. How far away was the car, in the driveway or in the gas station?</p>\n<p id=\"b227-16\">A. On Travilah Road in a gas station.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-17\">Q. How far away from the house?</p>\n<p id=\"b227-18\">A. I guess about half a mile.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-19\">Q. Did you see them working there?</p>\n<p id=\"b227-20\">A. No, I didn\u2019t. My husband\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b227-21\">Q. How do you know they were working there?</p>\n<p id=\"b227-22\">A. My husband told me.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-23\">Q. When did they get back from the gas station where they supposedly had been working on his car? What time in the evening?</p>\n<p id=\"b228-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>A. I think it was about a quarter to eleven.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">Q. Tell the Court whether or not you saw John Edward Mahoney in the early morning of August 11, 1967?</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">A. I saw him about 8:00 o\u2019clock that morning.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-7\">Q. When did you last see John Edward Ma-honey on the evening of August 10?</p>\n<p id=\"b228-8\">A. It was before I went to bed.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-9\">Q. And when did you go to bed?</p>\n<p id=\"b228-10\">A. 11:00 o\u2019clock.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-11\">Q. When you went to bed at 11:00 o\u2019clock in the evening on August 10, 1967 where was John Edward Mahoney?</p>\n<p id=\"b228-12\">A. He was at home.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-13\">Q. And he had not gone to bed; I gather he was up?</p>\n<p id=\"b228-14\">A. Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-15\">Q. So I gather that you did not see John Edward Mahoney from the time you went to bed at about 11:00 o\u2019clock on the evening of August 10, 1967, until about breakfast time of August 11, 1967, which would be around 8:00 o\u2019clock, is that right?</p>\n<p id=\"b228-16\">A. Right.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-17\">Q. And when did you see your husband last on the evening of August 10, 1967?</p>\n<p id=\"b228-18\">A. Do I have to say anything about it? He is my husband.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-19\">Q. I don\u2019t see why not. It couldn\u2019t incriminate you. You are not entitled to answer if something would incriminate you.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-20\">A. That is true, but\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b228-21\">Q. Your husband is serving twenty years. He has already been convicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-22\">A. Yes, he is. I saw him, the last time I saw him is when we went to bed and that was at 11:00 o\u2019clock.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-23\">Q. Did he go to bed with you?</p>\n<p id=\"b228-24\">A. Yes, he did.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>Q. And did he sleep with you that whole night?</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">A. As far as I know, he did.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">Q. When did you next see him?</p>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">A. It was when I woke up, 8:00 o\u2019clock that morning.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-8\">Q. Where was he when you woke up?</p>\n<p id=\"b229-9\">A. He was already up.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-10\">Q. He was not in the bed?</p>\n<p id=\"b229-11\">A. No.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-12\">Q. You can\u2019t say of your own knowledge where Mr. John Edward Mahoney was at 12:30 or one or 1:30 in the morning?</p>\n<p id=\"b229-13\">A. No, I don\u2019t.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-14\">Q. Of August 11, 1967.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b229-15\">As Mahoney stated in his Memorandum in Opposition to State\u2019s Motion for Leave to Appeal \u201ca reading of the transcript in [his] trial produces an overwhelming amount of evidence pointing to [his] guilt.\u201d We think it patent that the testimony of his mother and sister-in-law did not show that he was at home at the time the crime was committed or that he could not have been a participant. None of the other alleged alibi witnesses were produced at the hearing and that their testimony would have tended to show that Mahoney was elsewhere when the robbery occurred remains as a bald assertion by Mahoney. Therefore, on the record before us, considering the evidence adduced at the trial, the failure to call the so-called alibi witnesses, even if an improper exercise of judgment on the part of Mahoney\u2019s attorney, was not so prejudicial, beyond a reasonable doubt, as to deny him the effective assistance of counsel or due process of law. We conclude that it did not justify the granting of a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-16\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b229-17\">In the Memorandum Opinion accompanying its order the hearing court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-18\">\u201cIt has been further stated that the counsel was incompetent in that after the trial and sen-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>fencing of the Petitioner, trial counsel failed to request a review of the sentence by a Sentence Review Panel.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">The court thought this \u201cindicative of incompetency on the part of counsel.\u201d But it recognized that \u201cthis, of course, does not go to the issue of whether or not [Ma-honey] was fairly convicted * * *.\u201d We bring the matter up only because Mahoney discusses it in his brief. Rule 719 b 6 provides that appointed counsel shall advise the accused concerning his right to apply for a review of his sentence. But counsel shall assist in the preparation of an application for review of sentence only if directed by the accused. We have held that the duties imposed on appointed counsel by the Rule are imposed on privately retained counsel. <em>Murray v. Director, </em>8 Md. App. 400, <em>401; Evans v. Warden, 8 </em>Md. App. 26, 27. Even if the point were properly before us here, at best Ma-honey would be entitled to file a belated application for review of sentence provided his trial counsel had not advised him of the right to file an application for sentence review and provided his counsel had not assisted in the preparation of such application after being directed by the accused to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b230-7\">In the petition for post conviction relief as amended eleven allegations of error were presented in addition to that concerning competency of counsel. The hearing court found that those eleven contentions afforded no grounds for the relief prayed. The application for leave to appeal was filed by the State and as it went only to the issue of competency of counsel, the other eleven contentions are not before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-8\">\n<em>Order of 27 September 1971 setting aside the conviction of John Edward Mahoney in criminal 8850 and granting a new trial is reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b230-9\">\n<em>Mandate to issue forthwith.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b216-13\">.

John Mahoney challenged the admissibility of his alleged statement. Testifying in his own behalf on the limited issue of voluntariness, Mahoney claimed that he was subjected to police threats and improper inducements. He also said he never gave the police a confession. There was evidence before the court that no threats, promises, or improper inducements were made to obtain Mahoney\u2019s confession, and it was admitted for the jury\u2019s consideration. There was also evidence that Mahoney repudiated his statement shortly after making it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b225-14\">.
