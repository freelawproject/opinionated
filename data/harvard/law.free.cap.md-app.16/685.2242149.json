Rosenblatt, Assistant Attorney General, </em>with whom were <em>Francis B. Burch, Attorney General, Milton B. Allen, State\u2019s Attorney for Baltimore City, </em>and <em>James B.

Officer Sierakowski was shot 6 times and survived; Officer Sager died shortly after the attack. James Edward Powell was tried before a jury in the Criminal Court of Baltimore, Judge J. Harold Grady presiding, and convicted of the murder of Officer Sager and of assault with the intent to murder Officer Sierakowski. Consecutive sentences of life imprisonment and 15 years were imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-13\">Appellant raises a single issue in his appeal to this Court. Did the pre-trial suppression by the prosecution of a scientific report violate his right to be afforded due process of law?</p>\n<p id=\"b708-14\">As numerous police cars were responding to the scene of the shooting, one of them, in response to a citizen\u2019s hail, stopped a few blocks from the shooting. The citi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>zen told the officers that there were two men trying to gain entrance to the rear of his store at 723 W. Lafayette Avenue. The officers left their car and proceeded up the alley toward the rear of the store. Enroute, the officers observed two men huddled under the back porch of a house. A resident of the house opened the door and told the officers the men were trespassing. One officer observed a revolver under the steps upon which the men were then sitting and the men were placed under arrest. One of these two men was appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">Along with the revolver, a Rohm .38 caliber, the officers also recovered a pair of men\u2019s black gloves. In the revolver\u2019s chamber were three live shells and three discharged shells. Several additional officers responded to the scene of the arrest and searched the area. Under a sandbox in the yard where the two men had been arrested were recovered a .32 caliber Omega revolver and a pair of men\u2019s brown gloves. The cylinder of this revolver contained three live shells and two spent shells.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">The serial number of the Rohm revolver was checked through the Maryland State Police and was shown to have been purchased from a licensed firearms dealer by appellant in 1969. A bullet recovered during the autopsy performed on Officer Sager was shown to have been fired from this revolver. Several .38 and .45 caliber bullets were found at the scene of the shooting. Some of the .38 caliber bullets were identified as having been fired from the Rohm revolver. One .32 caliber bullet was found at the scene, but that bullet was so mutilated that it could not be positively identified as having been fired by the Omega revolver.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-7\">Appellant contests none of the facts or circumstances related above. His sole contention is that because an Assistant State\u2019s Attorney intentionally concealed the exculpatory results of scientific tests performed on certain pieces of physical evidence, he was denied due process of law. His argument and his reasoning are that, aside from his prior purchase of the death weapon and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>its subsequent recovery at the scene of his arrest, there was no evidence connecting him with the crime. He contends the suppressed results of the scientific tests would tend to show that he was not one of the police officers\u2019 assailants.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">There was testimony at trial that on the day after the shooting, April 25, 1970, there were delivered to the Scientific Crime Detection Laboratory of the United States Treasury Department swabs of the hands of appellant, his co-arrestee, and another person, and both pairs of gloves found at the scene of appellant\u2019s arrest. These items were to be subjected to neutron activation analyses, the results of which tests, if the elements antimony and barium were present, would indicate that a firearm had been discharged in close proximity to the material tested. Nowhere in the record does it appear when these tests were completed nor when the results of these tests were made known to State officials.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-6\">On January 25, 1971, there was hand delivered to the Assistant State\u2019s Attorney a Motion for Discovery and Inspection. Of the 41 requests itemized, there was included a request to furnish a list of the names and addresses of all witnesses \u201cwho will or might be called upon to testify for the State at trial.\u201d Other requests were to furnish \u201ccopies of any and all statements or reports of prosecuting witnesses, made at any time or place, which have been reduced to writing,\u201d and \u201cany information . . . which information is as to this defendant exculpatory.\u201d The last request was \u201cto furnish the defendant complete copies of any ballistics report, chemical, mechanical, or other, tests.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b710-7\">The State\u2019s answer to appellant\u2019s motion was filed December 10&gt;' 1971. The State itemized 93 persons on their \u201cList of Witnesses;\u201d the last entry was \u201cMaynard J. Pro U.S. Treasury Dept. Research and Methods Lab.\u201d The State declined to furnish the requested statements or reports because \u201cas presently drafted . . . [the request] is not within the purview of Maryland Rule 728.\u201d The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>State did consent, however, to \u201cmake available for inspection all items, including reports, photographs, bullets, charts, diagrams and analyses which the state intends to introduce at the trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">The results of the neutron activation tests conducted on the materials delivered to the Treasury Department were not made available to appellant prior to trial. The appellant alleges that orally, the prosecutor materially misrepresented to his counsel the results of those tests.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-6\">At a recorded chambers conference held the morning before the trial began, the court asked the prosecutor whether he could be more specific in limiting his list of witnesses to those he reasonably expected to call either on direct or on rebuttal. Among the sixteen prospective witnesses the prosecutor designated, was Maynard Pro. During the next six trial days the State presented its entire case. At a bench conference, after the State rested, one of appellant\u2019s counsel charged that \u201cthe State has been playing cagey with us about one of its witnesses they alleged was vital in this case, Maynard Pro.\u201d Counsel expressed surprise the State had not called Pro; however, he asserted the defense had, during trial, subpoenaed Pro at the address supplied by the State. He had spoken with Pro a few minutes ago and found that the subpoena had not been served. He stated that \u201cin view of the fact that we have requested every day of trial and before trial a copy of Mr. Pro\u2019s report, we would request now he [the prosecutor] give us a copy under <em>Giles </em>because we have a strong reason to believe it is exculpatory.\u201d The prosecutor stated his position that \u201cthe report of Mr. Pro, not called as a witness in this case, does not fall within the purview\u201d of discovery. He asserted his willingness to provide the court with a copy of the report for its determination as to its nature and value to the defense. He requested the court not show the report to the defense because they had \u201csubpoenaed Mr. Pro without having the slightest idea what he is going to say ... He is now their witness for good or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>for bad. If he had asked him five minutes ago on the phone, he would have found out what the report was about.\u201d Defense counsel reminded the court that the prosecution had \u201cpromised us every day last week as soon as he got a copy of his report, he would give it to us.\u201d Co-counsel added, \u201cNow [we] find today he had the report all along.\u201d The prosecutor interjected, \u201cIf he is called as a witness.\u201d The court determined that the prosecution possessed Mr. Pro\u2019s written report and directed that he provide copy thereof to the defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">In chambers the following morning, defense counsel stated they had had the report overnight and had met with Mr. Pro. One asserted that the prosecutor had \u201cmade two deliberate misrepresentations\u201d; briefly they were: (1) the prosecution had indicated the gloves found with Powell\u2019s revolver contained evidence of gunshot residue when Mr. Pro\u2019s report showed that in fact they did not; (2) the prosecutor numerous times denied having Mr. Pro\u2019s report but promised to deliver it to the defense as soon as he acquired it when, in fact, he had been in possession of the document for some time. The defense claimed prejudice on two grounds, only one of which is of any significance here as the other was settled by stipulation. He claimed to the trial court that the defense had been prejudiced in that they had been deliberately denied the report to use in opening remarks to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-6\">Accepting the trial court\u2019s invitation to make a statement, the prosecutor implicitly denied misrepresenting the results of the tests performed by Mr. Pro and specifically stated that \u201cwith respect to the divulgence of the report to the defense, I indicated if and when the State called Mr. Pro as a witness, a copy of the report would be provided to the defense . . . Up until that time [the State] declined to provide a copy of the unexplained result of the examination.\u201d He elsewhere argued that the State felt that the report of itself showed nothing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>unless explained by the person who administered the test.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">The defense withdrew its previous motion for a mistrial and moved for a directed verdict \u201con the basis of this tactic by the prosecutor which has prejudiced our case and which has kept us from presenting it in its best light so far as to the jury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b713-6\">The court explained its understanding of the posture of the defense\u2019s motion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-7\">\u201c[T]hat not being in possession of this information, whether it be exculpatory or not, it was not possible to include a reference to it in the opening statement . . . The motion made by defendant\u2019s counsel, as already indicated, while there was a failure to disclose this information which may or may not have been correct, I am not in the position to say that, but the fact is at the time the defendant\u2019s case was ready to be undertaken, both the statement was furnished and the witness has made himself available so that I do not see where any material prejudice has resulted.\u201d He continued, \u201cOpening statements are statements of what counsel expect to be able to prove during the trial of the case and if the evidence is disclosed during the trial, and now, obviously, this matter cannot be included in the opening statement, but the opening statement is not decisive on the question of what evidence is going to be presented thereafter, and I believe under the present posture of the case if there is any evidence helpful to the defendant, it will be presented to the jury. Consequently a motion for a directed verdict is denied.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b713-8\">The court having determined there was no prejudice did not resolve any factual issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-9\">The defense then began to present its case; Maynard Pro was called as a witness and testified that there were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>no traces of barium or antimony on the gloves found with appellant\u2019s revolver nor upon his hands. He added, however, that the fact that appellant was finger-printed and had washed his hands prior to the taking of the swabs might have affected the tests because the test \u201cis only good from the time you fired the gun to the first washing.\u201d In response to a hypothetical question, Pro testified that if a person washed his hands after firing a gun \u201cthe barium and antimony would be washed off. In most cases he would remove all of it.\u201d Barium and antimony were on one of the brown gloves found in the yard near the .32 caliber revolver.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">Although there is authority that an accused who is prejudiced by reason of the suppression of exculpatory evidence can obtain a new trial, we are aware of no authority which says he is entitled to an acquittal. Cases in Maryland and elsewhere are collected in 34 A.L.R.3d 16. We will consider the issue of prejudice nonetheless.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-6\">In its most recent decision concerning suppression by the State of evidence favorable to an accused, <em>Moore v. Illinois, </em>408 U. S. 786, 92 S. Ct. 2562, 2568, 34 L.Ed.2d 155 (1972), the Supreme Court applied the rules laid down in <em>Brady v. Maryland, </em>373 U. S. 83, 83 S. Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963). After a short summary of <em>Brady, </em>the Court directed consideration of the following factors: (1) suppression by the prosecution after a request by the defense; (2) the evidence\u2019s favorable character for the defense; and (3) materiality of the evidence. It stated, \u201cThese are the standards by which the prosecution\u2019s conduct in Moore\u2019s case is to be measured.\u201d In <em>Brady, </em>the suppressed evidence was a confession by a co-defendant admitting committing the act of killing for which Brady was being charged; evidence clearly material to Brady\u2019s case. In <em>Moore, </em>several eyewitnesses to a shooting identified the petitioner as the assailant. The Court held that evidence of one misidentification by a witness, suppressed by the prosecution, \u201cwas not material to the issue of guilt,\u201d and affirmed the petitioner\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>Powell\u2019s appeal is founded on the proposition that the result of the neutron activation analysis of the gloves found with Powell\u2019s gun was exculpatory evidence. The Supreme Court has not specifically defined the term exculpatory evidence, the Courts of this State, however, have. In <em>Ross v. Warden, </em>1 Md. App. 46, 227 A. 2d 42, 46, we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-5\">\u201cThe test in determining when a suppression of evidence can be said to amount to a denial of due process is that the evidence withheld was admissible, useful to the defense and capable of clearing or tending to clear the accused of guilt \u2014 i.e. exculpatory, or of substantially affecting the punishment to be imposed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b715-6\">See <em>State v. Giles, </em>239 Md. 458, 212 A. 2d 101, 108 (1965), vacated on other grounds, 386 U. S. 66, 87 S. Ct. 793, 17 L.Ed.2d 737 (1967). Our decision in this case, however, does not rest upon the characterization of the evidence as exculpatory or otherwise, but rather, upon whether there was such prejudice as to deny the appellant due process of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-7\">The appellant\u2019s trial began on Monday, January 10, 1972. It was recessed on Friday, January 14 and resumed at 10 o\u2019clock Monday morning, the 17th of January. Before the case was called on the morning of January 18, the passages above recited wherein appellant\u2019s counsel charged the prosecution with deliberate misrepresentation took place. Defense counsel admitted having possession of the report overnight before meeting with Mr. Pro that morning before the chambers conference. Based on these occurrences, the trial court, as noted above, denied the defense\u2019s motion for a directed verdict after finding no material prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-8\">Appellant claims prejudice because he was denied the use of the results of Mr. Pro\u2019s test in his opening address to the jury. We said in <em>White v. State, </em>11 Md. App. 423, 274 A. 2d 671, 675:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>\u201cMaryland is clearly in line with this majority position that the office of \u2018an opening statement in a criminal prosecution is to apprise, with reasonable succinctness, the trier of facts with the questions involved and what the State or defense expects to prove, so as to prepare said trier of the facts for the evidence to be adduced. * * * and it generally has no binding force or effect.\u2019 <em>Clarke v. State, </em>238 Md. 11, 19-20, 207 A. 2d 456, 460-461.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">The defense summoned Mr. Pro as its witness; it contacted Pro before the State rested; it received the report of the scientific analyses at the end of the State\u2019s case; had it for study and evaluation before resumption of the trial on the 18th of January; it consulted with Pro before the defense began presenting its case; it called Pro as a defense witness; and elicited from Pro the results of his scientific test. We agree with the trial court in its finding that under the circumstances in which the posture of this case developed, the availability of Mr. Pro\u2019s information for the defense counsel\u2019s possible use in his opening statement did not prejudice appellant. It is sufficient the defense had possession of the information in time to make use of it during the trial. The evidence did not by any means preclude the possibility, or indeed the probability, under all of the circumstances, that appellant was one of the criminals. The evidence merely tended to show that the assailant did not use the black gloves when the gun was fired. The evidence indicates that appellant washed his hands prior to the time the test swabs were taken. In any event, for whatever the evidence was worth it was presented to and considered by the jury. See <em>Shotkosky v. State, </em>8 Md. App. 492, 261 A. 2d 171.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b716-6\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b716-7\">. The public prosecutor is an official of the executive branch of government. His duty is to seek justice and not merely convictions. \u201cSociety wins not only when the guilty are convicted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>but when criminal trials are fair; our system of the administration of justice suffers when any accused is treated unfairly . . . a prosecution that withholds evidence on demand of an accused which, if made available, would tend to exculpate him or reduce the penalty helps shape a trial that bears heavily on a defendant.\u201d <em>Brady v. Maryland, supra, </em>83 S. Ct. at 1197. See <em>Ethical Consideration </em>7-13 and <em>Disciplinary Rule </em>7-103 of the Code of Professional Responsibility of the American Bar Association.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-11\">We do not wish our decision to be construed as in any manner approving misleading statements by the prosecution to defense counsel or the withholding of exculpatory evidence. Our decision is simply that there was no prejudice. The trial court did not decide whether the prosecutor did in fact intentionally mislead defense counsel concerning either his possession of, or the results of, Pro\u2019s report, nor do we. We do caution prosecutors that a literal compliance with Md. Rule 728 may not always satisfy the requirements of <em>Brady v. Maryland, supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
