We heard the appeal on 27 September. The same day we affirmed the adjudication that appellant was a child in need of supervision and affirmed that part of the order designated above as (1). We reversed those parts of the order designated above as parts (2) and (3). Mandate was issued forthwith. We now state the reasons for our decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-10\">(1)</p>\n<p id=\"b234-11\">Appellant, 16 years of age, was brought before the Juvenile Court on the petition of her mother, Mary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>Esther Cain.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Art. 26, \u00a7\u00a7 70-2 and 70-6; Maryland Rules 901, 902, 903. The petition, filed 21 September 1972, alleged that appellant was a child in need of supervision for the reason that on \u201cSeptember 14, 1972 * * * [she] did leave school without consent of her parent and stayed away from school until September 21, 1972.\u201d It seems that the petition was amended to include as a further reason \u201cthat she is pregnant.\u201d Rule 905. The same day the court authorized that she be placed in detention and directed the Sheriff, of Kent County to keep her in his custody pending further hearing. Code, Art. 26, \u00a7\u00a7 70-11 and 70-12. An adjudicatory hearing was held on 25 September. Code, Art. 26, \u00a7 70-17; Rule 912. Appellant\u2019s mother testified that Cindy was 16 years of age. She was asked what was the relationship between Cindy and Douglas Earl Nicholson and replied: \u201cI really didn\u2019t think they were seeing one another.\u201d She explained that \u201cCindy was punished for a whole month and she wasn\u2019t allowed out even on weekends, and that\u2019s because of Doug. * * * She was to go to the movies, and I found out the next day she didn\u2019t go to the movies at all, and she happened to be with Doug. And when I questioned her she said she had went to the movies, but I found out she didn\u2019t, so I punished her for a month.\u201d On 14 September Mrs. Cain received a telephone call from Cindy\u2019s school and was told that Cindy \u201chad signed herself out, that she had a doctor\u2019s appointment.\u201d Mrs. Cain then telephoned Doug\u2019s mother. \u201cI told her I didn\u2019t think the kids were in school, that Mr. Newman<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> had just called me, but Mr. Newman couldn\u2019t find out whether Douglas was in school or not.\u201d She next saw Cindy a week later at the jail. It was adduced that Cindy had run away a year before with Doug and Mrs. Cain had forbidden her to see him. It was when she found out they were still dating that she punished Cindy. Mrs. Cain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>learned on 11 September that Cindy was pregnant. Cindy said Doug was the father. Mrs. Cain told her daughter that \u201cI would like for her to have an abortion.\u201d On cross-examination it appeared that Mrs. Cain had been told by her sister-in-law that Cindy had made an appointment with a Doctor Farr. Mrs. Cain went to the doctor\u2019s office and met Cindy there. The doctor said Cindy was \"\"\"pregnant. Mrs. Cain and the Doctor and Cindy discussed an abortion, and Cindy said she did not want one. Mrs. Cain said: \u201cI talked to Cindy and I didn\u2019t seem to be getting anywhere one way or another. So I called the Health Center and I asked for someone there to talk to her, and I took her in there on a Wednesday morning [13 September] at 10:30. * * * Mrs. Betty Davis talked to her for about an hour. I was there during half the conversation and then Mrs. Davis talked to her by herself. * * * When we left the building I told Cindy I had to do some shopping, so I went to Leggett\u2019s and she wanted to go in and I asked her to sit in the car and think. And I was gone about 45 minutes and when I \"came back and started to go to Rock Hall she told me to call Dr. Farr, that she had decided to have an abortion.\u201d Mrs. Cain took \u201csteps to arrange\u201d for Cindy to have an abortion.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">Cindy testified that she first met Douglas Earl Nicholson about two years ago and was in love with him. Dr. Farr told her she was pregnant. She said she did not want to be aborted. She was asked her reasons and objection to the question was sustained, the court stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-6\">\u201cI think that is pretty well established anyway, Mr. Parks [appellant\u2019s counsel]. The reason for her running away she says is because she didn\u2019t want an abortion. You can argue that, whether you think there is some basis in the law giving a child the right to run away from home because she is pregnant and doesn\u2019t want an abortion. I think the facts are established that she is pregnant and that she ran away from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>home because she didn\u2019t want an abortion. I think we have enough on that.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">Cindy said there was no other reason for her leaving home than that she didn\u2019t want an abortion. When she found out she was pregnant she and Doug planned to get married. When they left on 14 September two friends took them to Centreville and then they hitchhiked to Kent-more Park. They spent the night at \u201ca couple of friends\u2019 house.\u201d On Monday morning they hitchhiked to Tolchester and remained until the police picked them up. On cross-examination she said Doug \u201cgot her pregnant\u201d and on redirect she reiterated that the only reason she ran away was \u201cbecause me arid Dougie didn\u2019t want to have an abortion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">Douglas Earl Nicholson testified that he was also 16 years of age, his date of birth being 12 July 1956. His version of what happened on 14 September and the days following until the police arrived was the same as that of Cindy, and his reason for running away was the same. \u201cBecause Cindy\u2019s mother wanted her to have an abortion and Cindy and I didn\u2019t want for her to get an abortion. * * * Well we figured that if we stayed away long enough so that she couldn\u2019t get an abortion then her mother couldn\u2019t make her get an abortion.\u201d He gave another reason. \u201cWell, we figured \u2014 we went to Centreville to see if we could get married and they said we couldn\u2019t.\u201d He had asked his parents to let him marry Cindy and \u201cthey said they wouldn\u2019t sign.\u201d He said he was the father of Cindy\u2019s \u201cchild-to-be.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b237-7\">The court found that Cindy Lou Smith was a child in need of supervision within the contemplation of the Juvenile Causes Act. A child is a person who has not attained 18 years of age. Code, Art. 26, \u00a7 70-1 (c). Section 70-1 (i) states that a child in need of supervision means:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-8\">\u201c(1) Subject to compulsory school attendance who is habitually and without justification truant from school;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-9\">(2) Without substantial fault on the part of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>his parents, guardian, or other custodian, who is habitually disobedient, ungovernable, and beyond their control.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AZc\">(3) Who so deports himself as to injure or endanger himself or others; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A-J\">(4) Who has committed an offense applicable only to children; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Add\">(5) Requires guidance, treatment, or rehabilitation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b238-8\">That a child is in need of supervision must be established by a preponderance of the evidence. Code, Art. 26, \u00a7 70-18 (c). It was not disputed that Cindy was a \u201cchild\u201d within the definition of the Act and that she was pregnant as alleged in the petition. We think the evidence was sufficient in law to show that Cindy deported herself so as to endanger herself. Not only had she become pregnant but she had twice run away from home. The last time she hitchhiked on the highways with a 16 year old boy, first from Centreville to Kentmore Park where they spent the night with friends, and then to Tolchester. Where they spent the nights in Tolchester until they were found by the police is not clear. Having so deported herself it is patent that this 16 year old, pregnant, unmarried girl required guidance and treatment, particularly in light of a declared purpose of the Juvenile Causes Act \u201cto provide for the care, protection and wholesome mental and physical development\u201d of children coming within its provisions. Code, Art. 26, \u00a7 70 (1). The evidence being legally sufficient to prove that Cindy Lou Smith was a child in need of supervision as alleged in the petition, the Juvenile Court was not clearly wrong in its judgment that she was. Rule 1086. Therefore we affirmed the determination that Cindy Lou Smith was a child in need of supervision.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-9\">(2)</p>\n<p id=\"b238-10\">A disposition hearing followed hard on the heels of the adjudicatory hearing. Code, Art. 26, \u00a7 70-17; Rule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>913. Code, Art. 26, \u00a7 70-19 (a) authorizes the court to make such disposition of a child found in need of supervision as most suited to the physical, mental and moral welfare of the child. On the evidence adduced we see no abuse of this discretion in the placing of Cindy in the custody of her mother, under the supervision of the Department of Juvenile Services subject to the further order of the court. Therefore we affirmed the order of the Juvenile Court in that respect.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">(3)</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">It was the opinion of the Judge below that a 16 year old child did not have \u201cany particular and special rights in derogation of their parents * * * with respect to the abortion law and the medical laws.\u201d He continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-7\">\u201cIt was to encourage children not to have unplanned for families, and it was to encourage children to go to doctors, and hospitals or clinics to handle the venereal disease problem, which is becoming an ever-growing problem. It seems to me it is philosophy. I can\u2019t read into it they have a right to consent and therefore they have a right to object, because the philosophy back of it is to get medical assistance to the people and prevent these unfortunate social consequences, of early, promiscuous sexual conduct on the part of young people who are totally incapable of dealing with these problems.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b239-8\">The Judge stated that he was not operating under Code 43, subtitle \u201cAbortion\u201d, but under Art. 26, the Juvenile Causes Act. He said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-9\">\u201cI think that the Court can certainly support parents in doing what they think is best for the child. If Mrs. Cain thinks it is best for her child to have some medical procedure to terminate the pregnancy \u2014 if she withheld it and the Court found it was against the interest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>of the child the Court could order it, in my opinion. We don\u2019t have the mother refusing the medical procedure, we have her desiring the medical procedure and the daughter refusing to obey her mother\u2019s orders.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">The court then recalled the mother to ascertain \u201cwhat her desires are and what the medical possibilities are.\u201d The transcript of her testimony reads in relevant part:</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">\u201cQuestions by Mr. Cooper [State\u2019s Attorney] :</p>\n<p id=\"b240-7\">Q. Now, in contemplation of your daughter having an abortion, have you made any arrangements with any doctors?</p>\n<p id=\"b240-8\">A. Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-9\">Q. What arrangements have you made?</p>\n<p id=\"b240-10\">A. She is supposed to be at Easton on Wednesday morning.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-11\">Q. Who is her doctor?</p>\n<p id=\"b240-12\">A. I can\u2019t remember his name. I think it is Johnson, I am not sure.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-13\">Judge Rasin: By Easton do you mean the Easton Memorial Hospital?</p>\n<p id=\"b240-14\">A. Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-15\">Q. At Easton Memorial Hospital in Easton, Md.? What time?</p>\n<p id=\"b240-17\">A. I can\u2019t remember. One was 10:30.1 think this was 10:45.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-18\">Q. And the abortion was to be performed at that time?</p>\n<p id=\"b240-19\">A. Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-20\">Judge Rasin: Who made those arrangements? Through Dr. Farr?</p>\n<p id=\"b240-22\">A. No, I made them.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-23\">Judge Rasin: And it is still your desire that Cindy Lou be aborted of this pregnancy?</p>\n<p id=\"b240-24\">A. Yes sir.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-25\">Judge Rasin: When you talked with Dr. Farr you say it was on the 11th of September?</p>\n<p id=\"b240-26\">A. It was Monday a week ago.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>Judge Rasin: And Dr. Farr examined Cindy Lou?</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">A. Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">Questions by Mr. Parks [appellant\u2019s counsel] :</p>\n<p id=\"b241-7\">Q. Do you know whether or not, within your knowledge, the Easton Memorial Hospital Board has met and approved her having an abortion ?</p>\n<p id=\"b241-8\">A. No, I don\u2019t.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-9\">Q. Do you know whether any other doctor has examined her other than Dr. Farr?</p>\n<p id=\"b241-10\">A. I don\u2019t think so.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-11\">Q. Do you know whether or not she has seen any psychiatrist or psychologist?</p>\n<p id=\"b241-12\">A. Not to my knowledge she hasn\u2019t.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-13\">Q. Yet the abortion is planned for the 27th, which is two days from now?</p>\n<p id=\"b241-14\">A. Yes sir. If it is to be done she has a very limited time.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-15\">Q. Do you know how far pregnant she is ?</p>\n<p id=\"b241-16\">A. She is due in April.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-17\">Q. Normally she would have gotten pregnant in July?</p>\n<p id=\"b241-18\">A. Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-19\">Q. This would be approximately 8 or 10 weeks then?</p>\n<p id=\"b241-20\">A. Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-21\">Q. You say she has been pregnant, as far as you know, about 10 weeks?</p>\n<p id=\"b241-22\">A. Approximately.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-23\">Q. She has a maximum of 16 weeks under the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-24\">A. Dr. Farr, when he explained it to me, said the sooner the better.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-25\">Q. Do you have any evidence in your own personal knowledge that the continuation of this pregnancy would greatly impair the health\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b241-26\">Mr. Cooper: I object.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-27\">Judge Rasin: Sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>Q. Do you have any evidence within your own personal knowledge that there is or is not any substantial risk on the birth of the child, of any physical deformity or retardation?</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">Mr. Cooper: Objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">Judge Rasin: Sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-7\">Q. Do you have any evidence that Easton Memorial Hospital is a hospital accredited by the joint commission of hospitals and licensed by the State Board of Health and Mental Hygiene?</p>\n<p id=\"b242-8\">Mr. Cooper: Object.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-9\">Judge Rasin: Sustained. I think the Court will take judicial notice of that fact.</p>\n<p id=\"AVR\">Q. Knowing what you have heard today and understanding that your daughter is violently opposed to having an abortion do you still want her to have one?</p>\n<p id=\"AgM\">A. I don\u2019t see any other way out, sir.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-11\">Q. That is not answering my question.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-12\">Judge Rasin: I think it is.</p>\n<p id=\"A1S\">A. I am here because I don\u2019t want to force Cindy. I am here for help.</p>\n<p id=\"ARN\">Q. If you knew she were violently opposed would you make her go through with it?</p>\n<p id=\"b242-15\">Mr. Cooper: Objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-16\">Judge Rasin: Overrule. Answer the question.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-17\">A. Would you repeat it?</p>\n<p id=\"b242-18\">Judge Rasin: The question is, would you still want her to have the abortion in the face of her strenuous objection?</p>\n<p id=\"b242-19\">A. Yes sir.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-20\">Judge Rasin: You would not change your mind?</p>\n<p id=\"b242-21\">A. No sir.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-22\">Mr. Cooper: Do you feel you will need the aid of the Court to get her to the hospital?</p>\n<p id=\"b242-23\">Mr. Parks: Objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-24\">Judge Rasin: I think that is obvious.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b243-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>The judge summed up his feelings:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-5\">\u201cI do not believe that any child who is 16 years of age has the right to disregard her parents\u2019 control and supervision and do as she desires and then force the parent to do what that child wants to do herself. Statistics and experience certainly show that children who are born under these circumstances have many difficult days and it is usually left up to a social agency or the grandparents to take care of the child. The Court does not believe it is in the interest of an unborn child to be born under these circumstances. I am well aware of the romance and unreasonable response, particularly on the part of young people in this type of situation, which is completely unrealistic as to who is going to support them, how they are going to live, where they will find a job. Because again, I have been on the Bench long enough in this County to see these cases end up right back in Court * * * So I have no hesitancy at all in supporting Mrs. Cain in this case, and directing that she obey her mother, and that she submit herself to the medical procedure of abortion that has been arranged by Mrs. Cain.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">He explained what he was doing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-7\">\u201cNow what I am doing, I want the record and everybody else to clearly understand, I am merely supporting the mother, who is the natural guardian, and the only natural guardian of Cindy Lou Smith, in her plans to deal with her child in a manner which she deems is in the best interest of her child and really of the unborn child, and I support her 100%. I feel this is indeed a practical way to deal with this problem, considering the age of these two young people.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b244-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>The order here appealed from was passed. As a \u201cSpecial Condition\u201d it was ordered \u201cthat Cindy Lou Smith shall obey her Mother in submitting to the medical procedures at Easton Memorial Hospital to terminate her pregnancy and that the request and instructions from her Mother shall be sufficient authority for any medical doctor or hospital to provide this treatment.\u201d To implement this \u201cSpecial Condition\u201d the court further ordered, despite that it had placed the child in the mother\u2019s custody, \u201cthat Cindy Lou Smith shall be retained by the Sheriff of Kent County, who shall deliver her to Easton Memorial Hospital, at the request of her Mother, Mary Esther Cain.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">\u201cThe father and mother are the joint natural guardians of their minor child and are jointly and severally charged with its support, care, nurture, welfare and education.\u201d Code, Art. 72 A, \u00a7 1. The guardianship devolves upon the surviving parent. Ibidem. Medical care is embraced within the scope of the broad language of the statute. <em>Craig v. Craig, </em>220 Md. 590.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">Abortion was dealt with by Ch. 470, Acts 1968, codified as Art. 43, \u00a7\u00a7 137-139.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Section 137 provides that only a physician licensed by the State of Maryland in a hospital accredited by the joint commission for accreditation of hospitals and licensed by the State Board of Health and Mental Hygiene may terminate a human pregnancy otherwise than by birth and then only if one or more of the following conditions exist:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-7\">\u201c(1) Continuation of the pregnancy is likely to result in the death of the mother;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-8\">(2) There is a substantial risk that continuation of the pregnancy would gravely impair the physical or mental health of the mother;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-9\">(3) There is substantial risk of the birth of the child with grave and permanent physical deformity or mental retardation;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>(4) The pregnancy resulted from a rape committed as a result of force or bodily harm or threat of force or bodily harm and the State\u2019s Attorney of Baltimore City or the county in which the rape occurred has informed the hospital abortion review authority in writing over his signature that there is probable cause to believe that the alleged rape did occur.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">And in no event shall any physician terminate a human pregnancy unless not more than 26 weeks of gestation have passed (except when continuation of the pregnancy, is likely to result in the death of the mother or where the fetus is dead) and authorization therefore has been granted in writing by a hospital abortion review authority appointed by the hospital. Code, Art. 43, \u00a7 137 (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">We do not construe the order of the Juvenile Court as directing that an abortion be performed. Clearly here such mandate would be beyond the power of the Court; termination of a human pregnancy can be authorized only by the abortion review authority appointed by an accredited hospital. Further the legislature made clear that no person shall be required to perform an abortion and no hospital shall be required to permit an abortion to be performed in its institution. Code, Art. 43, \u00a7 138. As we interpret the order, the court, satisfied that Cindy\u2019s mother desired her daughter to be aborted, commanded the daughter to obey her mother by submitting to such procedures as would ascertain the existence of a condition permitting a legal abortion so that the required authorization of a proper hospital abortion review authority could be obtained and the pregnancy terminated. Patently there was no evidence before the lower court sufficient to establish that one of the requisite conditions in fact existed and that the necessary hospital authorization had been given. The question is whether, for reasons not within the ambit of the abortion statute, a parent having the custody of a minor daughter who has attained the age of 16 years may compel that child over <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>child\u2019s opposition to submit herself to procedures which may lead to an abortion. We do not think it was the legislative intent that a parent have this power. The \"statute expressly provides that no person shall be required to participate in medical procedures which result in the termination of pregnancy and the refusal of any person to do so shall not be a basis for any recriminatory action by the State or any person. Code, Art. 43, \u00a7 138 (a). And it sets out in unambiguous language that the \u201crefusal of any person to submit to an abortion or to give consent therefor shall not be grounds for loss of any privileges or immunities to which such person would '\"\"otherwise be entitled * * Id., \u00a7 138 (c). When a minor child is involved, as is here the case, these provisions must be read in conjunction with Code, Art. 43, \u00a7 135, dealing with a minor\u2019s capacity to consent to medical treatment. First enacted by ch. 468, Acts 1967, the statute was rewritten in ch. 758, Acts 1971, to provide that \u201ca minor shall have the same capacity to consent to medical treatment as an adult\u201d if one or more ^designated conditions apply. The conditions set out are: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>Under the conditions set out, the minor, having the same capacity to consent as an adult, is emancipated from the control of the parents with respect to medical treatment within the contemplation of the statute. We think it follows that if a minor may consent to medical treatment as an adult upon seeking treatment or advice concerning pregnancy, the minor, and particularly a minor over 16 years of age, may not be forced, more than an adult, to accept treatment or advice concerning pregnancy. Consent cannot be the subject of compulsion; its existence depends upon the exercise of voluntary will of those from whom it is obtained; the one consenting has the right to forbid. And we feel that \u201cmedical treatment\u201d within the meaning of the minor consent statute encompasses termination of pregnancy within the contemplation of the abortion statute. We find support in the law authorizing the marriage of minors for our conclusion that the legislative intent was that a female minor over 16 years of age is emancipated from the control of the parent with respect to matters concerning pregnancy. By the provisions of Code, Art. 62, \u00a7 9 (a) \u201cA male over the age of 18 years or a female over the age of 16 years may marry without parental or guardian\u2019s consent, where required,* ***<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> upon presenting a certificate from a licensed physician stating that he has examined the female and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>positively ascertained that she is pregnant or has given birth to a child.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>\u201c(1) The minor has attained the age of eighteen (18) years.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-6\">(2) The minor is married or the parent of a child.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-7\">(3) The minor seeks treatment or advice concerning venereal disease, pregnancy or contraception not amounting to sterilization.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-8\">(4) In the judgment of a physician treating a minor, the obtaining of consent of any other person would result in such delay of treatment as would adversely affect the life or health of the minor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-9\">(5) The minor seeks treatment or advice concerning any form of drug abuse as defined in \u00a7 2 (d) of Article 43B of the Annotated Code [Comprehensive Drug Abuse Control and Rehabilitation Act].\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b248-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>The short of it is that the Juvenile Court did not have , the power to compel Cindy to resort to medical procedures 1 relative to a termination of her pregnancy on the ground \u25a0that her mother wanted her to have an abortion. Therefore we reversed such parts of the order of the Juvenile Court which so compelled her.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b235-5\">.
