The terms of the decree provided that the appellant was to pay the sum of $42.70 per week to the appellee as permanent alimony and the additional sum of $10.00 per week for each of three minor children. One of the children has since reached her majority and appellant no longer contributes to her support.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-11\">The record discloses that on February 26, 1971 the appellee filed a petition to cite the appellant for contempt of court because of appellant\u2019s failure to abide by the terms of the decree relative to alimony and support. This resulted in an order adjudging the appellant to be in contempt of court and sentencing him to incarceration for a period of 30 days which was suspended, conditioned upon payment of the accrued arrearage of $1487.50. On July 23, 1971, the appellee filed a second petition seeking the same relief. The appellant filed no answer to this petition as such, but did, on October 4, 1971, file a \u201cPetition For Modification Of Decree Of Court\u201d in which he prayed that the <em>\u201csupport payments </em>* * * be modified to be commensurate with his present income and living expenses.\u201d (Emphasis supplied). Albeit no request was made in the petition to reduce <em>alimony </em>payments, the Chancellor and the parties treated the petition as a re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>quest for modification of both support and alimony payments. So shall we.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">At the conclusion of the hearing on the petition for modification and answer thereto, Judge E. Mackall Childs refused to alter the children\u2019s support payments but did reduce the weekly alimony payments from $42.70 to $25.00 with the proviso that \u201c[t]he difference, amounting to seventeen dollars and seventy cents will be carried forward accumulatively and will be payable by the [appellant] to the [appellee] pursuant to further order of this court.\u201d The appellant was also ordered to pay to the appellee \u201cone hundred fifty dollars ($150.00) toward her counsel fees and three hundred ten dollars ($310.00) representing one round trip air fare from California.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">Appellant avers that the trial court abused its discretion when it (1) accumulated the suspended portion of the alimony payments subject to further order of the court, (2) awarded counsel fees and reimbursement of air fare, and (3) required the husband to show cause at a later date why the original decree should not be reinstated.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b312-8\">We think the appellant\u2019s first and third contentions are interrelated and therefore shall treat them as one.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-9\">When appellant appeared before Judge Childs, he testified that prior to the hearing on the first contempt citation, he had deliberately reduced his income by quitting his job. This, he said, was the advice of his then counsel \u2014not present counsel; the hypothesis being the less he earned, \u201cthe better impression it would be for me, in my payments.\u201d Appellant then admitted that Judge Melvin had \u201cset me straight.\u201d After terminating his next employment, the appellant went into business in Ocean City, Maryland, but the business \u201cflopped.\u201d At the time of the last hearing the appellant was hopeful that he would be reemployed by his former employer and in the same capacity that he had held prior to his quitting. Both appellant and appellee related to the court their respective <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>living expenses. The appellant\u2019s figures were \u201cestimated\u201d as was his stated income of $160.00 per week.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">The trial judge said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-6\">\u201c[T]here has been a significant change in the financial circumstances of Mr. Bracone [appellant] and this time it was not as a result of his own calculation. Moreover, the court is of the opinion that Mrs. Bracone [appellee] is employable and no logical reason was advanced as to why she had not at least sought employment to supplement her income. The fact that she may have been wronged by her husband would not entitle her forever thereafter to be indolent.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b313-7\">Appellant relies strongly upon the recently decided case of <em>Crandall v. Crandall, </em>14 Md. App. 476, 287 A. 2d 326 (1972). There, the husband had lost his employment because of a personnel cutback. However, he received retirement pay from the U. S. Navy and had also received severance allowances from his previous employer. He petitioned for modification of the decree requiring alimony payments. The trial court reduced the payments from $575.00 per month to $450.00 per month for a period of 26 weeks, subject to review at the end of that period so that the court could decide \u201cwhether the reduction in alimony payments * * * shall accrue to the benefit of the [wife] * * * at a later date or if said reduction shall be made absolutely.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b313-8\">In <em>Crandall, </em>in discussing the order for modification, we said, at 481:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-9\">\u201cWhile the order appealed from does not expressly state that appellant will not be required to pay unto the appellee the suspended portion of alimony for the period of time that the appellant was actually unemployed, but actively seeking gainful employment, we think the rational inference that such is the case must prop<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>erly be drawn therefrom. To hold otherwise would render the order of suspension merely illusory relief and an abuse of discretion.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b314-5\"><em>Crandall, </em>however, is factually inapposite, because there the husband never voluntarily took affirmative action to reduce his income, whereas in the instant case the appellant did do so. While it is true that the appellant candidly admitted the error of his ways and is now repentant, the fact remains that his financial plight is of his own creation. Judge Childs did not think appellant should profit from his misdeeds, nor do we.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">The Chancellor said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-7\">\u201c* * * [S]ince the [appellant\u2019s] own deliberate acts were directly attributable to his leaving the job he now seeks to regain, the amount reduced will not be forgiven, but will be carried forward to be repaid in future installments after the defendant has been given an opportunity to establish himself financially.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b314-8\">It is patent that Judge Childs was not unaware of his authority to suspend all or a portion of the alimony. <em>Courson v. Courson, </em>213 Md. 183, 129 A. 2d 917 (1957) ; <em>Crandall v. Crandall, supra. </em>Under the circumstances of this case, we do not believe the Chancellor abused his discretion or that the relief afforded to the appellant was merely illusory. On the contrary, the Chancellor tailored the relief to fit the fabric. He granted a temporary reduction of a portion of the alimony but, because of the appellant\u2019s prior misconduct, allowed the deferred portion of the alimony to accumulate, subject to the further order of the court. The Chancellor also required the appellant, at the expiration of one year, to show cause, if any he may have, why the original alimony order, <em>i.e., </em>the payment of $42.70 per week, should not be reinstated. Appellant argues that in <em>Crandall </em>the trial court retained unto itself the right to make a determination at the end of 26 weeks whether or not the husband would be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>required to pay all or a portion of the alimony that was suspended, while here the burden rests on the appellant to demonstrate why the original order should not be reinstated. We think the appellant seeks to draw a distinction without a difference. Whether the trial court <em>sua sponte </em>determines the question of reinstating the original order <em>vel non </em>or requires the appellant to show why it should not be reinstated is of no practical significance. The net effect of either situation would be similar as far as the type and source of information, as well as the facts necessary for the trial court\u2019s determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">Appellant next attacks the award of counsel fees and reimbursement to appellee of the round trip air fare from California. Sometime after the divorce <em>a vinculo </em>was granted, the appellee and her minor daughter removed themselves to the San Diego, California area where they took up residence with one of the appellee\u2019s married daughters. A minor son of the parties remained in Maryland where he is a student at Towson State College. The appellee has obligated herself for the payment of the tuition. When the second petition to cite appellant for contempt was set for hearing, the appellee flew to Maryland accompanied by her minor daughter. While here, appellee stayed with a second married daughter who resides in Anne Arundel County. Judge Childs declined to reimburse the appellee for the minor child\u2019s air fare on the ground that the child\u2019s presence was not required. He did, however, allow $150.00 for counsel fees and $310.00 for appellee\u2019s round trip air fare from California.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-7\">Md. Ann. Code art. 16, \u00a7 5A provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-8\">\u201cIn all cases where a person makes an application for a decree or modification of a decree with respect to the custody, the amount of support or visitation rights concerning a child or children of the parties, or files any form of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>proceeding to recover arrearages of child support or otherwise to enforce such decree, the court, after considering the financial status of both parties, their respective needs and whether there was substantial justification for instituting or defending the proceeding, may make such award of costs and counsel fees to either party as shall be just and proper under all the circumstances.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">We think it too obvious to require additional comment that the trial judge was empowered under the above quoted statute to award counsel fees to the wife\u2019s solicitor, that the award of $150.00 was \u201cjust and proper under all the circumstances,\u201d and that there was \u201csubstantial justification\u201d for defending the proceedings. <em>Rhoderick v. Rhoderick, </em>257 Md. 354, 263 A. 2d 512 (1967) ; <em>Peterman v. Peterman, </em>14 Md. App. 310, 286 A. 2d 812 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">There is no express provision in the above quoted statute for the award of travel expenses, unless such expenses are embraced within the meaning of the word \u201ccosts.\u201d Judge Childs concluded that had the legislature meant for \u201ccosts\u201d to have the narrow interpretation of \u201ccourt costs,\u201d the General Assembly could easily have inserted the word \u201ccourt\u201d before the word \u201ccosts.\u201d He equated \u201ccosts\u201d as used in the statute with \u201csuit money.\u201d <em>Rubin v. Rubin, </em>233 Md. 118, 195 A. 2d 696 (1963). Although the Chancellor found no necessity for the appellee to be present at the modification hearing, he based the travel expense award on the necessity for her presence at the hearing scheduled on the second contempt petition, even though that hearing was never held because the appellant apparently made a payment of the arrearage a day or so before the trial date.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-7\">Judge Childs found that the wife\u2019s presence at the modification hearing was not necessary because the burden was on the appellant to show a change of circumstances. We do not agree with that reasoning in view of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>the fact that the appellant sought a modification to either reduce alimony or child support, or both, and consequently the appellee had a vested interest in the support of her children which was threatened. Her presence may have been required to protect that interest. In any event, whether the trial judge relied on the contempt citation or on the modification, we do not think his award of travel expenses to be erroneous. The husband\u2019s non-compliance with the original alimony and support order led to the filing of the second contempt petition and a hearing date being set which resulted in the wife\u2019s presence in Annapolis.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">The cases relied upon by the appellant to bolster his position that the wife was not entitled to the \u201csuit money\u201d are <em>Price v. Price, </em>232 Md. 379, 194 A. 2d 99 (1963), and <em>Reese v. Mandel, </em>224 Md. 121, 167 A. 2d 111 (1961). Both are inapposite. <em>Price </em>holds that a husband\u2019s obligation to pay his wife\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees rests upon the existence of the marital relationship and that when the marital relationship ends the husband\u2019s obligation ends with it. Here, however, the petition for modification was directed to \u201csupport.\u201d The Chancellor\u2019s \u201cMemorandum of Decision\u201d is silent as to his reasons for the award of the counsel fee, but we think it implicit in his memorandum that the counsel fee was awarded for the representation of the minor children under the provisions of Ch. 488 of the Acts of 1967, now codified as Art. 16, \u00a7 5A.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\"><em>Reese </em>arose from a zoning reclassification proceeding in Baltimore County. Appellant reads <em>Reese </em>as authority that \u201c[t]he transportation costs, in the absence of a statute, are not allowable.\u201d Our perusal of <em>Reese </em>leads us to the conclusion that it offers no solace to the appellant. What <em>Reese </em>actually states is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-7\">\u201cIt is almost universally held that the law in respect to costs existing at the time of the judgment that ends the controversy between the parties (in the absence of a saving clause or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>clear indication in the new statute or rule of court to the contrary) prevails over the law as it existed at the time when the action was commenced * * *.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">Here, we have a \u201cnew statute,\u201d Art. 16, \u00a7 5A, and we agree with Judge Childs that \u201ccosts\u201d in the instant case is the equivalent of \u201csuit money.\u201d <em>Rubin v. Rubin, supra; Colburn v. Colburn, </em>15 Md. App. 503, 292 A. 2d 121 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">\n<em>Order affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b318-7\">\n<em>Costs to be paid by appellant.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
