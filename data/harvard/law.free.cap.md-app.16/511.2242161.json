Hackett Turner, Jr. presiding with a jury, of committing rape and perpetrating unnatural and perverted sexhal practices. Consecutive sentences of 20 and 10 years, respectively, were imposed. Doye contends certain evidence was improperly admitted at the trial and that he was improperly required to remove his jacket and roll up his sleeves to assist in the witness\u2019s identification.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-9\">The victim, at the time of the crime was a 17 year old high school student. She testified that about 4:30 p.m. on the 13th of July, 1970, she left two children for whom she was babysitting, at the Mohican Hills Swimming Pool in Montgomery County. Upon entering the parking area, she noticed seven to ten persons gathered around two cars with flat tires. She proceeded along a wooded path \u2014 a three-block long shortcut \u2014 from the parking lot enroute to Glen Echo Heights. As she walked, someone put his left arm around her neck and extended his right arm in front of her brandishing a knife. She saw a red bandana with what she thought was \u201ca little white . . . in the area of his neck or face.\u201d With the knife placed against the small of her back, the witness was ordered farther into the woods where her assailant wrapped her head with her towel and forced her to participate in an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>act of fellatio and then to submit to sexual intercourse. She described the man as approximately her height with muscular arms pigmented \u201cchocolate brown\u201d or a little lighter, \u201csort of slender\u201d hips, between 20 and 25 years of age.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">The witness identified a red bandana with white markings as being \u201csimilar\u201d to the one worn by her assailant. She identified a white handled knife as the one used by her assailant, pointing out that it was distinguishable because of a \u201clip \u2014 it\u2019s a little jut thing \u2014 and it seemed, I knew it wouldn\u2019t fold down because of the way it was constructed and the handle was sort of dirty and white.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">Also admitted into evidence were a pair of trousers which the victim characterized as \u201cvery similar to the ones that I saw at the time, the color is the same.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b536-7\">She testified that the man in the third position at the lineup she had attended was similar in height, build and in the growth of hair on his chin to her attacker. That man\u2019s voice also sounded like her assailant when he was asked in the lineup to repeat the words, \u201cDon\u2019t shout, don\u2019t scream \u2014 .\u201d She then identified the appellant as the man who had appeared in the lineup and who looked and sounded like her assailant.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-8\">When the appellant was required to exhibit his arm to the witness, she characterized it as muscular and the same in color as that of her attacker. She stated that the lineup photograph depict\u00e9d the appellant with a goatee whereas he was not wearing one at the time of trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-9\">Catherine Betty Yoklavitch testified that on the 13th of July, 1970, she saw a man on the parking lot adjacent to the Mohican Hills Pool who looked like the appellant. When shown the photographs exhibited shortly after the incident, the witness selected the \u201cman third on the left in all these photos,\u201d further asserting that the appellant was now wearing a longer hairstyle and appeared to be more clean-shaven. He wore a knit shirt, gray pants, and an untrimmed growth of hair on his face when observed on the parking lot.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-10\">Further describing her encounter with the man, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>witness stated that she got into her car and began backing it out of the parking lot when \u201cit went \u2018clonk\u2019.\u201d She emerged from the car to discover she had a flat tire. She called to a man \u201cgoing into the woods\u201d and asked whether or not he saw \u201cany kids fooling with my car,\u201d whereupon the man replied he had seen no one and was \u201cjust passing through.\u201d The man \u201cwalked right up\u201d to the witness and the two conversed for \u201cnot more than three minutes.\u201d She considered asking him to assist her in changing the tire, but decided otherwise when she remembered she had no money.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">The witness described the man as young and \u201cstrong-looking\u201d but \u201ca little thick through the waist for a young man.\u201d Asked if the defendant were the man she talked to she replied, \u201cIt\u2019s been a long time ... I believe it is.\u201d She later testified that a man she saw at a preliminary hearing was the same man \u201cthat I\u2019d seen and talked to at the swimming pool.\u201d Yoklavitch further described the man she encountered in the parking lot as wearing a knit shirt and light gray cotton trousers.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">Charles Montrie, a high school student, testified that he left the Mohican Hills Swimming Pool in the company of his girlfriend, Janet Pettis, and her brother Raymond, on July 13, 1970, at approximately 3:30 p.m. As the three proceeded on a path that leads from the pool to Walhondy Road, the witness met and exchanged greetings with a stranger passing in the opposite direction. He described the man as \u201c5'6\", 5'7\", . . . stocky, he had a goatee, a medium bush, ... a neckerchief around his neck . . . [and] a red neckerchief dangling from his pocket.\u201d He identified appellant as that man.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-7\">Two days later, the witness went to the Sycamore Store with his girlfriend and was buying a soft drink when appellant entered the store. Montrie looked away so that he would not appear to be staring. After appellant left, the witness \u201cwaited at the door\u201d and then went to an outside telephone booth to call the police. From about 200 feet he observed appellant \u201cwalking up the road, he was almost around the curve and he turned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>around and saw me and . . . ran around the curve so that I couldn\u2019t see him anymore.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">The witness indicated he had selected appellant at the lineup because \u201che was the one I saw on the path and then again in the store.\u201d He observed the man fifteen seconds on the day of the crime and approximately a half a minute on July 15th. On cross-examination he further stated, \u201cI would say that I am fairly sure that [the appellant] is the same man I saw on the path.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">Janet Pettis, a sixteen year old eleventh grade student at Walt Whitman High School, testified that on July 13, 1970, she left the Mohican Hills Swimming Pool with Charles Montrie and her brother at approximately 3:45 p.m. The trio met a black man proceeding down a path in the opposite direction. She testified, as had Montrie, that the man said \u201chi\u201d and that the three responded with a similar greeting.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-7\">At the time of the pathway confrontation, she looked directly into the man\u2019s eyes as he passed and noticed that he had on a pair of gray pants, an orange-yellow shirt, a blue neckerchief around his neck and a red and white neckerchief hanging from his pocket. Pettis also related the incident which occurred at the Sycamore Store two days later, adding that she saw the man on a third occasion at the police lineup and once again at the preliminary hearing. She asserted she was \u201cninety percent positive\u201d that the man she saw on the path and again at the Sycamore Store, was the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-8\">Norma Dana Speigel testified that on the day in question, she drove her daughter to the swimming pool, stopping her car at the intersection of Walhondy Road and the path where the preceding witnesses observed appellant. There she saw a man standing with his foot on a concrete rampart of the bridge approximately fifty feet away. She identified appellant as that man. She stated that he was carrying a brown paper bag, wore a cap and that he had a red handkerchief, \u201cvery prominently protruding from either a pocket or just out of his ..belt.\u201d The witness identified State\u2019s Exhibit 10-H as the photo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>graph of appellant she had selected sometime before the lineup as depicting the man she saw on the bridge near the path.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">Lieutenant Robertson testified that the officers, executing a search warrant on a black 1960 Dodge registered to appellant\u2019s wife, seized a brown handled steak knife with a four inch blade, a steak knife with a four and <em>% </em>inch blade and bone-colored handle, a yellow skull-type cap, and a State of Maryland Department of Employment Security identification card bearing the name of George Doye.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">Execution of a search warrant on the premises at 8711 Plymouth Street produced a brown-colored short-sleeved shirt from a closet, one red handkerchief and a multicolored scarf from the dresser. From a second bedroom, they obtained a knife with a dark gray handle and a man\u2019s cap. State\u2019s Exhibit 1, the handkerchief, and State\u2019s Exhibit 13, the scarf, were identified and admitted into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-7\">The witness indicated that an arrest warrant was executed the day after the lineup, and that at that time Doye was wearing bluish-gray work trousers and a green T-shirt. At the time of the arrest Doye gave as his address 8711 Plymouth Street, Apt. 2 in Silver Spring.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-8\">Counsel for the appellant agreed to stipulate that a representative of the Department of Motor Vehicles would testify that the Dodge automobile in question was registered to Joan Doye of 8711 Plymouth Street, Silver Spring, Maryland.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-9\">The defense produced Ida Jean Warfield, a member of the Women\u2019s Army Corps stationed at Fort Myer, Virginia, who testified that on the 13th of July, 1970 at approximately 2:00 p.m., Doye came to her home.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> She said that Doye had not gone to work that day because he had to \u201cgo up to see about his separation papers.\u201d She had been dating the appellant for quite some time, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>seeing him almost every evening. According to the witness, Doye had been living with his mother on Maple Avenue in Takoma Park and Benjamin Townsend had been living with the appellant\u2019s wife and another woman. She testified that she, her sister and one Robert Maul\u00e9 were riding in Mrs. Doye\u2019s automobile when the police stopped them and arrested the operator, Benjamin Townsend, thinking him to be the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-4\">The appellant did not testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">I Attack on Evidence Alleged to be Irrelevant and Prejudicial</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">Initially, Doye contends the trial judge committed error in admitting into evidence State\u2019s Exhibit No. 2, a white-handled steak knife which the victim identified as the one used by her assailant. He argues that the knife was not shown to have been exclusively in his possession because it was found in his wife\u2019s car several days after the crime and other persons had access to the car. In his argument he fails to distinguish between cases which turn on the possession of recently stolen goods or criminal tools, identified as being connected with a particular crime and the cases where a tool of a crime is offered simply as one link in a chain of circumstantial evidence. It is significant that appellant, while quoting at length from 1 Wharton, <em>Criminal Evidence, </em>\u00a7 203, (12th Edition) omitted the following quote from page 408:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-7\">\u201cIt is also relevant to show that the defendant owned or <em>had access </em>to any article with which the crime was or <em>could have been committed.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b540-8\">The distinction is drawn much more sharply in 2 Wig-more, <em>Evidence, </em>\u00a7 412 (3d Ed., 1940) :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-9\">\u201cThe only matter that is here of concern is the <em>admissibility </em>of circumstantial evidence of identification; and it will easily be seen that very <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>few questions can arise from this point of view. The usual matter of dispute, when such evidence is offered, is whether it is sufficient to found a <em>presumption, </em>or, as a mass of evidence, to support a verdict; and in this aspect it raises an entirely different question.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b541-7\">Appellant seeks support from <em>People v. Urban, </em>381 Ill. 64, 44 N.E.2d 885, 887 in which the court did not make the above distinction. The case is readily distinguishable because the decision turned on the question of exclusive possession of stolen goods.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-8\">The rule is well established that physical evidence need not be positively connected with the accused or the crime to be admissible; it is admissible where there is a reasonable probability of its connection with the accused or the crime, the lack of positive identification affects only the weight of the evidence. <em>Woodell v. State, 2 </em>Md. App. 433, 234 A. 2d 890; <em>Tomolillo v. State, </em>4 Md. App. 711, 245 A. 2d 94. We hold the State\u2019s Exhibit No. 2 was properly admitted into evidence for consideration by the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-9\">Appellant also cites <em>Riley v. State, </em>179 Md. 304, 18 A. 2d 583 and <em>Sugarman v. State, </em>173 Md. 52, 195 A. 324. These cases concern the admission of illegally seized evidence and are not apposite to his argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-10\">Appellant next argues the admission of the second knife, found in the search of the car, and the exhibition to the jury of the switchblade knife found in a bedroom, were \u201cprejudicial.\u201d We fail to see how exposing the jury to two extra knives to which appellant had access could have been any more inflammatory than displaying one properly admitted and identified as being \u201csimilar to the one\u201d used in the crime. We cannot say the trial judge abused his discretion in overruling objections that this evidence was inflammatory, although we agree the extra knives served no legitimate purpose in the trial and it would have been better practice to have excluded them.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-11\">Appellant argues further, however, that evidence show<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>ing he had access to three knives indicated a propensity for knife ownership and as such, constituted the use of evidence of the type condemned in <em>Huber v. State, </em>2 Md. App. 245, 234 A. 2d 264. In that case the testimony showed the assailant bound and unbound his female victim several times. We held it error to admit tracings, which artistry was attributed to the accused, of women in various conditions of bondage. The prejudicial effect of that evidence is patent. The mere access to two additional knives is hardly in the same category. While we do not condone the action of the prosecutor in displaying the additional knives to the jury, we can see no real prejudice to the accused.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">There was objection to Mrs. Yoklavitch\u2019s testimony that at the time of her confrontation with appellant two of her tires as well as the tires of other cars in the vicinity had been punctured. Assuming such evidence should not have been admitted, we are again unable to see any prejudice to the accused who was in no way shown to be involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">As we said in <em>Shotkosky v. State, </em>8 Md. App. 492, 261 A. 2d 171, an accused is entitled to a fair, not a perfect, trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-7\">II Search Warrant</p>\n<p id=\"b542-8\">Appellant claims the warrant which was obtained to search the car and the home failed to show probable cause. The state offered to place the warrant in the record without exhibiting it to the jury, but did not do so on the assurance of appellant that such procedure was unnecessary. We have repeatedly held that the validity of a search warrant must be determined solely on the face of the warrant and any accompanying papers incorporated therein, and not on subsequent testimony. <em>Scarborough v. State, </em>3 Md. App. 208, 238 A. 2d 297; <em>Gerstein v. State, </em>10 Md. App. 322, 270 A. 2d 331. Appellant bears the burden of seeing that there is included in the record all that is necessary for us to decide a question he raises. <em>Gray v. State, </em>10 Md. App. 478, 271 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>A. 2d 390. Since he failed to supplement an inadequate record we decline to consider the question. <em>Vernon v. State, </em>12 Md. App. 157, 277 A. 2d 635.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">Ill Photographic Identification</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">Appellant concedes we have held that the absence of counsel at a photographic identification will not affect the admissibility of the identification. <em>Conway v. State, </em>15 Md. App. 198, 289 A. 2d 862; <em>Crenshaw v. State, </em>13 Md. App. 361, 283 A. 2d 423. We decline to depart from our prior rulings. The testimony fails to show anything improper about the manner in which the photos were exhibited to any of the witnesses but appellant also makes the bald allegation in his brief that a visual review shows that photographic Exhibits 9A through 9C and 10A through 10K were impermissibly suggestive. Once again the photographs are not in the record and we decline to consider the question. <em>Gray v. State, </em>and <em>Vernon v. State, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b543-7\">IV Self-Incrimination</p>\n<p id=\"b543-8\">The victim identified appellant as the man she identified at the lineup as being similar in appearance to her attacker. She testified that he was in court wearing a suit, a pink shirt and a cravat. The following colloquy then occurred:</p>\n<p id=\"b543-9\">\u201cMr. Craven: Your Honor, could the Defendant be requested to rise and remove his jacket and roll up his sleeve past the elbow?</p>\n<p id=\"b543-10\">Mr. Bell: Your Honor, we\u2019re going to lay an objection to that.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-11\">The Court: Alright, I\u2019m going to overrule the objection, Mr. Bell, and ask your client to stand and do as he\u2019s been requested.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-12\">Mr. Craven: We\u2019d ask that it be the sleeve nearest the Jury and the witness, your Honor.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-13\">The Court: Yes sir.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-14\">(Whereupon Defendant rose, removed his jacket and rolled up his sleeve as requested)</p>\n<p id=\"b544-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>Q. Now, I ask you \u2014 can you see that arm from here?</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">A. Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">Q. What, if anything, do you notice about that arm?</p>\n<p id=\"b544-7\">A. Well, it\u2019s very muscular and it\u2019s the same color.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-8\">Q. Same color as what?</p>\n<p id=\"b544-9\">A. As the attacker \u2014\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b544-10\">Appellant argues that <em>Allen v. State, </em>183 Md. 603, 39 A. 2d 820 requires us to hold that he was coerced to produce evidence against himself in violation of the Maryland Declaration of Rights, Article 22 and the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States and therefore his convictions must be reversed. The Court in <em>Allen </em>was particularly careful in expressing the limitations of its holding, saying at 612-613: \u201cIt is to be borne in mind that the particular purpose in seeking to have the accused try on the hat was <em>not to aid in identifying him </em>by showing how he looked with it on or off, as in the case of <em>People v. Pecho, </em>362 Ill. 568, 200 N. E. 860, where the compelled wearing of a hat was approved as an aid to identification, but was for the sole purpose of attempting to prove his ownership of this incriminating article. If the conformity or fit of the hat had been perfect, or convincingly close to perfection, that fact would have appeared from the enforced action of the accused. If the result of the experiment had been otherwise . . . the very fact that he objected to making it would have been prejudicial. In either event, it amounted to a clear case of testimonial compulsion.\u201d The exhibition in the instant case was intended only as an aid to the victim in identification and is thus squarely within the exception pointed out in <em>Allen.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b544-11\">Nor do the Supreme Court opinions dealing with the Fifth Amendment require us to hold as appellant suggests. In discussing a case in which a witness testified that an accused put on an article of clothing and that it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>fit him well, Mr. Justice Holmes observed, \u201cBut the prohibition of compelling a man in a criminal court to be witness against himself is a prohibition of the use of physical or moral compulsion to extort communications from him, not an exclusion of his body as evidence when it may be material. The objection in principle would forbid a jury to look at a prisoner and compare his features with a photograph in proof.\u201d <em>Holt v. United States, </em>218 U. S. 245, at 252-253, 31 S. Ct. 2, at 6, 54 L. Ed. 1021 (1910).</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">More recently, the Court observed, \u201cthe privilege is a bar against compelling \u2018communications\u2019 or \u2018testimony,\u2019 but that compulsion which makes the suspect or accused the source of \u2018real or physical evidence\u2019 does not violate it.\u201d <em>Schmerber v. California, </em>384 U. S. 757, at 764, 86 S. Ct. 1826, at 1832, 16 L.Ed.2d 908 (1966). The Court there held that incriminating evidence of the result of a compelled blood test was not inadmissible on Fifth Amendment grounds. In rejecting a claim that an individual\u2019s compelled vocal participation in a pre-trial lineup violated his privilege against self-incrimination, the Court in <em>United States v. Wade, </em>388 U. S. 218, at 222-223, 87 S. Ct. 1926, at 1930, 18 L.Ed.2d 1149 (1967), observed, \u201cIt is compulsion of the accused to exhibit his physical characteristics, not compulsion to disclose any knowledge he may have. It is not different from compelling Sehmerber to provide a blood sample or Holt to wear the blouse, and, as in those instances, is not within the cover of the privilege. Similarly, compelling Wade to speak within hearing distance of the witnesses, even to utter words purportedly uttered by the robber, was not compulsion to utter statements of a \u2018testimonial\u2019 nature; he was required to use his voice as an identifying physical characteristic, not to speak his guilt.\u201d In holding that handwriting exemplars did not violate petitioner\u2019s Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination, the Court in <em>Gilbert v. California, </em>388 U. S. 263, at 266-267, 87 S. Ct. 1951, at 1953, 18 L.Ed.2d 1178 (1967) stated, \u201cA mere handwriting exemplar, in contrast to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>the content of what is written, like the voice or body itself, is an identifying physical characteristic outside [the] protection [of,the privilege against self-incrimination.]\u201d The privilege against self-incrimination has evolved to protect only communicative or testimonial statements rather than \u201cidentifying physical characteristics\u201d or compulsion making the accused a source of \u201creal or physical evidence.\u201d <em>Schmerber, supra, </em>384 U. S. at 764, <em>United States v. Wade, supra, </em>388 U. S. at 222-223. See <em>Simms v. State, </em>4 Md. App. 160, 242 A. 2d 185. Compelling appellant to expose his forearm to the jury and the victim, a part of the body sometimes not concealed by ordinary attire, the Court was requiring the appellant to submit to observations infringing no more upon the privilege than compelling him to \u201csubmit to fingerprinting, photographing or measurements, to write or speak for identification, to appear in court, to stand, to assume a stance, to walk or to make a particular gesture\u201d recognized as permissible in <em>Schmerber, supra, </em>384 U. S. at 764.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b539-10\">.
