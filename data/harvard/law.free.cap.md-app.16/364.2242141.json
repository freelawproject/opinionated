Levin, sitting without a jury in the Criminal Court of Baltimore, and a sentence of life imprisonment was imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-11\">It appears from the record that appellant entered a tavern in Baltimore City during the late afternoon of October 3, 1970. According to the owner of the tavern, she approached the bar, advised him she wanted to play the pinball machine, and requested a dollar\u2019s worth of change. At that time the deceased, Viola Watkins, who had been in the bar drinking since approximately 2:30 p.m., was sitting on a bar stool next to the appellant. The tavern owner testified that the deceased \u201chad about forty or fifty cents in front of her, and when Miss Love, the defendant, was taking change from me, Vi thought that she was taking her change from the bar and she started fussing with Mildred.\u201d The owner stated, however, that Miss Love had not taken the deceased\u2019s money. He testified that \u201cMiss Mildred got real excited about it, and she wanted to start fighting. One of the gentlemen there took Miss Mildred out. * * * Five minutes after she was taken out she came right back in the place. * * * She looked real upset and come right at Miss Vi. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>* * * And Vi jumped off the stool facing her. * * * And it happened so fast, right away she stabbed her twice, Miss Love stabbed Miss Vi twice. * * * [A] 11 I saw was the long blade of the knife. I didn\u2019t see the handle.\u201d The deceased was taken to a nearby hospital where she was pronounced dead on arrival. The autopsy report indicated that the victim had a blood alcohol rating of .26.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">At the trial below a plea of not guilty by reason of insanity was entered on behalf of appellant. In support of that plea and to overcome the threshold presumption of appellant\u2019s sanity, Dr. John Marshall Hamilton, Superintendent of The Clifton T. Perkins State Hospital, was called on behalf of the appellant. Dr. Hamilton explained that he had been requested by Judge Charles D. Harris to conduct a \u201ccursory examination\u201d to determine \u201cwhether Mrs. Love required hospitalization or whether she should be maintained appropriately in the jail\u201d pending her trial. He stated that \u201c [e] ssentially the examination disclosed a person who was suffering from what I determined a residual schizophrenic set of symptoms, plus mental retardation of the magnitude which is classified as borderline mental retardation. Her actual full scale I.Q. was 66 on the psychological that we administered. * * * I think in my report I indicated that it would be useful to have a full range evaluation in a hospital setting to determine adequately the effect of her illness, the drugs she had been taking and the alcohol she had been drinking on her behavior at the time of the incident for which she is on trial took place, and I described her as being, in my opinion, only marginally responsible at best. This I know is relatively vague, but at the time I examined her I didn\u2019t think we were able to come to any firm kind of conclusion about her capacity at the time of the crime, but my feeling was that there certainly was enough doubt about her functioning so that she deserved to have a full range evaluation in the setting of a hospital for a sixty day period of time.\u201d He was asked by counsel for appellant how he drew the line \u201cbetween marginal and the question of whether she was, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>in fact, able to understand or know what she was doing at the time.\u201d Dr. Hamilton answered: \u201cI wasn\u2019t able to establish for myself the kind of definiteness, you know, of drawing a line and saying on this side definitely she was not responsible and on this side she definitely was He * * <em>\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">On cross examination Dr. Hamilton was asked whether he had come to a firm conclusion as to whether she was responsible at the time of the alleged offense and he replied : \u201cI don\u2019t have a firm opinion about that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b389-7\">On the basis of this testimony the trial judge ruled that \u201cthere has been a sufficient rebutting [of the presumption of appellant\u2019s sanity] to require the State to produce whatever testimony and/or evidence it may have.\u201d The State thereupon called Dr. Sherrill Cheeks, Assistant Clinical Director, Springfield State Hospital. He stated that he was appellant\u2019s \u201cphysician during\u2014 from 1965 through 1968, at which time she was first admitted to Springfield State Hospital\u201d and that he had also seen her \u201cat a forensic staff conference\u201d some months before trial. The following colloquy then took place between the Assistant State\u2019s Attorney and Dr. Cheeks:</p>\n<p id=\"b389-8\">\u201cQ. And Doctor, do you have an opinion today within a reasonable degree of medical certainty as to whether or not Mildred Love is a person who, as a result of a mental disease or defect, lacks substantial capacity either to appreciate the criminality of her conduct or to conform her conduct to the requirements of the law?</p>\n<p id=\"b389-9\">A. I believe that she does possess that capacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-10\">Q. And do you have an opinion today as to Mildred Love\u2019s competency to stand trial today?</p>\n<p id=\"b389-11\">A. I believe she does have that capacity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b389-12\">On cross examination appellant\u2019s counsel asked him: \u201cDoctor, what is the test for whether a person is sane or insane in the State of Maryland?\u201d He replied: \u201cIf he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>understands what he is doing, and if he understands the consequences of his act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">At the conclusion of Dr. Cheeks\u2019 testimony, the trial judge in the course of his ruling that appellant was legally sane at the time of the alleged crime stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-6\">\u201cI think the difficulty contained in this type of testimony is that lawyers and judges are confronted with a field in which they are really not as learned as the witness \u2014 certainly I am speaking for myself \u2014 and yet I think the key word is substantial in the test; that is to say, a Defendant is not responsible for criminal conduct and shall be found insane at the time of the commission of the alleged crime if at the time of such conduct, as a result of mental disease or defect, he or she lacked substantial capacity either to appreciate the criminality of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b390-7\">Although the issue was not raised by the State or by the appellant in this appeal, it is perfectly evident that the trial judge, the State\u2019s Attorney, and the appellant\u2019s counsel all were proceeding on the assumption that the legal test of criminal insanity involved a determination of whether or not the accused was suffering from a \u201cmental disease or defect.\u201d This was the law from 1967 to 1970 (see Md. Code, Art. 59, \u00a7 9 (a)).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> However, under the law today and under the law at the time of the appellant\u2019s trial below, November 1971, whether the accused was suffering from a \u201cmental disease or defect\u201d played no role in a determination of the accused\u2019s criminal insanity. Md. Code, Art. 59, \u00a7 25 (a). As this Court stated through our then Chief Judge Murphy (presently Chief Judge of the Court of Appeals of Maryland) in <em>Sherrill v. State, </em>14 Md. App. 146, 148:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-8\">\u201cChapter 407 of the Acts of 1970, which be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>came effective July 1, 1970, repealed Article 59 of the Maryland Code in its entirety and enacted in its place a new Article 59. The test for criminal responsibility was set forth in Section 25 (a) of the new Act. It was identical to that contained in the repealed Section 9 (a) except that it substituted the term \u2018mental disorder\u2019 for the phrase \u2018mental disease or defect.\u2019 But unlike the former law, which contained no statutory definition of the terms \u2018mental disease or defect,\u2019 the new law defined the term \u2018mental disorder\u2019 in Section 3 (f) to mean \u2018mental illness or mental retardation or any other form of behavioral or emotional illness resulting from any psychiatric or neurological disorder.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">Later, in <em>Young v. State, </em>14 Md. App. 538, 544, Chief Judge Orth (then Associate Judge) stated that the 1970 amendment created an exception \u201cof the utmost significance\u201d and went on to say at 545-546:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-6\">\u201cApplying the meaning of \u2018mental disorder\u2019 and the meanings of the terms used in defining its meaning as set out in \u00a7 3, the test reads:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-7\">A defendant is not responsible for criminal conduct and shall be found insane at the time of the commission of the alleged crime, if at the time of such conduct he lacks substantial capacity either to appreciate the criminality of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law, because of:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-8\">(1) any mental disorder which so substantially impaired his mental or emotional functioning as to make it necessary or advisable for his welfare or for the safety of the persons or property of others that he receive care and treatment; OR</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-9\">(2) a degree of subnormality of in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>tellectual development expected to be of life duration which reduced his capability to manage himself or his affairs; OR</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-5\">(3) any other form of behavioral or emotional illness,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AT\">which, as to any of the three, were the result of any psychiatric or neurological disorder other than an abnormality manifested only by repeated criminal or otherwise antisocial conduct.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b392-7\">Having established that the lower court committed error in applying the outdated test for criminal insanity, the question remains whether the error was harmless. See <em>Sherrill, supra. </em>We think it was not.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-8\">Both doctors agreed that appellant was mentally retarded and mental retardation is a mental disorder (Md. Code, Art. 59, \u00a7 3 (f)) ; both agreed that she had suffered from schizophrenia (although at the time of the alleged crime it was in a remissive stage) and that schizophrenia is a mental disorder. The appellant herself testified that on the day of the alleged crime she had consumed three or four half pints of whiskey, that she was taking approximately 100 milligrams of Thorazine and had injected herself with cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-9\">Under all of the circumstances, we cannot say that the application of the wrong test at the trial below to determine appellant\u2019s criminal insanity was harmless error <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and, accordingly, the judgment of conviction of first degree murder will be reversed and the case will be remanded for a new trial. In view of our conclusions we do not reach the issue that the evidence was legally insufficient to sustain the appellant\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-10\">\n<em>Judgment reversed; case remanded for a new trial.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b390-9\">. 1968 Replacement Volume.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b392-11\">.
