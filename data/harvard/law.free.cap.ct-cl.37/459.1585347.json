The schooner Conrad, John Osborn, master, sailed on a commercial voyage on or about the 18th day of April, 1799, from Baltimore, Md., bound to St. Thomas. While peacefully pursuing- said voyage she was seized on the high seas on or about the 29th day of the said month by the French privateers Clementine, Captain Lavering, and Narbonnois, Captain Furet, and conducted to the islands of Guadeloupe, where said vessel and cargo were condemned and ordered sold for the benefit of the captors by decree of the tribunal of commerce and prizes sitting at Basseterre in said island, and thereby became a total loss to the owners thereof.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b566-8\">The grounds of condemnation as set forth in the decree were as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b566-9\">First. \u201cThat the sea letter of which the captain of the said schooner was the bearer did not conform to the model annexed to the treaty of February 6, 1778.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b566-10\">Second. \u201cThat Conrad Eiselen, supercargo and one of the owners of the said vessel, who, according to his own avowal, is a native of Germany, carried with him no proof of his naturalization as an American citizen.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b566-11\">It nevertheless appeared by the register on board that Conrad Eiselen was one of the owners of the vessel and a citizen of the United States.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b566-12\">II.

It was accordingly held that the condemnations of the vessels were not illegal. In the present case it also appears that an owner of the vessel was foreign born and that no evidence of his naturalization was produced before the prize court.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>The difference between those cases and the present one is that the schooner Conrad carried her American register, while the others did not. That register impressed upon the vessel the character of nationality and declared to all the world that her owners were citizens of the United States. \u201cA certificate issued under the authority of the Government must bo taken by foreign powers as genuine and can bo impeached by them only byT application to the Government of the United States.\u201d (3 Whart. Int. L., sec. 409.) Who is and who is not a citizen .of the United States must be determined by the Government of the United States, and once authoritatively determined can not be questioned by the tribunals of a foreign power.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-4\">This remark, of course, does not extend to cases where a foreign power is the one to which the person originally owed allegiance. The right of an individual to expatriate himself without the permission of his own government has been one of the vexatious diplomatic questions of the last century and has been generally the subject of adjustment by treaty. But that right to question citizenship does not extend to nations who claim no allegiance from the individual. To the French courts in the eighteenth century the register of an American vessel should have been conclusive evidence; its only impeachment could have been through the application of the French Government to the Government of the United States, giving reasons whj^ the register should bo set aside.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">It must therefore be held in this case that the condemnation of the schooner Conrad was illegal, and the case will be so reported to Congress, together with a copy of this opinion,</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
