S., 598); that is to say, upon the payment to the State, and her acceptance of the principal sum properly expended by her, the interest should cease, for the reason that with said principal sum in her treasury the State could indemnify herself against thereafter accruing interest on her bonds either by loaning the money to meet her interest obligations or by depositing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>the same in some interest-paying bank, as was done by the State of New York as to a portion of the canal fund, and for which the United States was given credit in the New York case; or the State, at her election, could use the money to meet her other obligations \u2014 in either of which events the United States, from the time they so paid said principal sum, would be entitled to credit for reasonable interest thereon as against interest accruing on such bonds subsequent to such payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-4\">The conclusion of the court thus reached was certified to the Secretary of the Treasury, who acquiesced in the action of the court and certified the several claims to the Congress for payment; and the Congress, by the act of February 14, 1902, ratified the action of the court by making appropriations to pay the several amounts so allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">And by said act it was provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-6\">\u201cAnd the claims of like character arising under the act of Congress of July twenty seven, eighteen hundred and sixty-one (twelfth Statute, page two hundred and seventy-six), and joint resolution of March eight, eighteen hundred and sixty-two (twelfth Statute, page six hundred and fifteen), as interpreted and applied by the Supreme Court of the United States in the case of the State of New York against the United States, decided January six, eighteen hundred and ninety-six (one hundred and sixtieth United States Reports, page five hundred and ninety-eight), not heretofore allowed, or heretofore disallowed, by the accounting officers of the Treasury, shall be reopened, examined, and allowed, and, if deemed necessaiy, shall be transmitted to the Court of Claims for findings of fact or determination of disputed questions of law to aid in the settlement of the claims by the accounting-officers.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b632-7\">The act referred to reopens the claims of like character with those for which the appropriation was made as aforesaid and charges the accounting officers with the settlement thereof; and the accounting officers having acted in the premises and reported their action to Congress, with the apparent acquiescence of the Department, it is deemed that further action by the court is unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-8\">For the reasons given, we herewith return to the Secretary of the Treasury all the papers transmitted to the court, together with the report of the auditor of the court, for the information of the accounting officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>The clerk is directed to certify this opinion, together with the papers indicated, to the Secretary of the Treasury.</p>\n<judges id=\"b633-5\">Nott, Ch.
