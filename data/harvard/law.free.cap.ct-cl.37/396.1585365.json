While peacefully pursuing said voyage she was seized on the high seas by the French privateer Le Renard, Captain Breton, and conducted to Port de la Liberte, and afterwards condemned and sold as good prize, for the benefit of the captors, by decree of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>tribunal of commerce and prizes, sitting at Basse Terre, Guadaloupe, dated April 4, 1800.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b503-4\">Tbe grounds of condemnation as set forth in the decree were as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b503-5\">Considering that from the papers analyzed, and from those concerning the above examination, it is established that the supercargo of the vessel, who is the owner, is a native of Scotland, according to his declaration made at his examination; that he submits no documents which evidences that he was naturalized before the time of the declaration of war between France and England.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b503-6\">Considering that among the papers of the said vessel there is no sea letter or commission, no r\u00f3le d\u2019equipage, but a single agreement between the captain and his crew, as was admitted by the supercargo in his examination, which document not being invested with the signatures of public officers can not take the place of a r\u00f3le d\u2019equipage, not being in proper form as it is prescribed by the model annexed to the treaty of the 6th of February, 1778, between France and the United States.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b503-7\">II.

A number of the persons and firms having insurance claims appear as petitioner\u2019s in this proceeding, claiming to recover the amount paid to Donaldson <em>&amp; </em>Co-, on the vessel and cargo, amounting substantially to the sum stated as insurance. The basis of their claim as insurers is the risk which they took and paid on the property of Donaldson &amp; Co.; and in order for them to recover in this proceeding, it must be shown that the owner of the property upon which they had and jiaid insurance was a citizen of the United States. Their rights as insurers are dependent upon and incident to the ownership of Donaldson &amp; Co.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-8\">If the property of Donaldson &amp; Co. was legally subject to seizure and was condemned, as shown by the decree, Donaldson &amp; Co. would have no right in the property as against the belligerent right of the French Government, and would not be entitled to recover in this proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-9\">The statute which gives the court jurisdiction provides: \u201cThat such citizens of the United States, or their legal representatives, as had valid claims of indemnity upon the French Government, arising out of illegal captures,\u201d etc., * * * \u201ccan apply by petition to the Court of Claims within two years from the passage of this act, as hereinafter provided.\u201d If the property at the time of seizure belonged to a subject of Great Britain, it was property seized and condemned.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-10\">The fact, as shown in this case, is that James Donaldson <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>was a British subject, and it is not shown who or what was the nationality of his partner. That fact appearing to the French court, that Donaldson was a British subject, it was justified in the condemnation of the property, and the extent of that condemnation was commensurate with the whole property, and nothing was left to the insurers as against the legal effect of that decree. The findings do not establish a legal liability on the part of the defendants, and no allowance is therefore made, as shown in the conclusion of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-4\">The foregoing findings and conclusion of lav/, with a copy of this opinion, will be reported to Congress.'</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
