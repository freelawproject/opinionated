The brigade is composed of less than three regiments of twelve companies each.

The accounting officers are not authorized to inquire into the wisdom, expediency, or necessity of assigning an officer to a command above that pertaining to his grade; but it is within their authority to inquire whether the order of assignment to higher command was carried into effect according to law, and to what extent the officer performed the service to which he was assigned.</syllabus>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b361-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number><em>The Reporters' </em>statement of the case:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b361-5\">The following are the facts-of the case as found by the court:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b361-6\">I.

The claimant presented a claim to the Auditor for the War Department, who' disallowed the same on the ground that the force commanded by the claimant did not constitute a full brigade under section 9 of the act of April 22, 1898. Claimant appealed from this decision to the Comptroller of the Treasury, who on March 14,1901, recommended, by letter to the Secretary of the Treasury, that the claim be referred to the Court of Claims. The Secretary of the Treasury accordingly on March 18, 1901J transmitted the papers in the claim to this court under the authority of section 2 of the act of March 3, 1883, and requested an opinion on certain questions stated by the Comptroller.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b361-9\">IV. Nothing has been found of record to show the organizations of which the Second Brigade, First Division, Second Army Corps, was composed on September 12, 1898.

In order to receive pay for exercising- such higher command is it necessary that during the particular period for which he exercises such command that ho be actually in command of three regiments, each consisting at the time of twelve organized companies?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-13\">\u201c5. Under the facts herein recited, as applicable to Col. William J. Glenn, is he entitled to the pay of a brigadier-general for the periods therein set out?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-14\">\u201cAs there are many cases now pending involving the same point as the one now under consideration, which must await the decision in this case, it is requested that the court be asked to advance this on its docket and to render a speedy decision.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-15\">\u201cA return of the original papers is requested.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-16\">\u201c Respectfully,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-17\">\u201cR. J. Teacewell, Comptroller.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b364-18\">It is stated in the communication of the Comptroller to the Secretary that it is conceded that Colonel Glenn was assigned, by orders issued by competent authority, to an alleged command above that pertaining to his grade of colonel.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>The main question is, Was the alleged brigade to which the officer was assigned a brigade within the meaning of the law at any or all the different \u25a0 times for which the difference of pay is claimed?</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">The difficulty arises from the fact, as stated by the Auditor of the War Department, that during the time that the claimant was in command of the Second Brigade it was composed of less than three full regiments; and hence the question involved is whether the pay of the claimant as a brigade commander is thereby limited because of such fact to the emolument of a colonel of a regiment.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">In answer to the first question propounded by the letter of the Comptroller it may be said that the second section of the act to which reference is made in the inquiry leaves it discretionary with the President in a condition of war to organize a regiment consisting of twelve companies by making a third battalion for each regiment consisting of four companies by uniting skeleton companies and by organizing two additional companies. (30 Stat. L., 364.)</p>\n<p id=\"b365-7\">Whatever may have been done by the President in pursuance of the discretionary power conferred on him by that act, the condition established by the facts of this case shows that there, was a state of organization existing in the troops composing the force in which the claimant performed the service of brigadier, indicating that the order given by the President had not at the time of the rendition of the service been carried into effect in the reorganization of the troops commanded by the claimant.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-8\">The statute on which the claim is made (30 Stat. L., 362) was passed by Congress on the 22d of April, 1898, but four days before the act of the 26th of April, 1898 (30 Stat. L., 364), and they both form a part of the policy intended by Congress in the government of the Army incident to the then condition of war with Spain.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-9\">The first statute has reference to a policy which is applicable to a condition of immediate necessity which may arise in the immediate exigency of war, and the other, from a more settled policy of military organization. -</p>\n<p id=\"b365-10\">The first statute provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-11\">\u201cThat in time of war, or when war is imminent, the troops in the service of the United States, whether belonging to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>Regular or Volunteer Army, or to the militia, shall be arranged as far as practicable into divisions of three brigades, each brigade to be composed of three or more regiments.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">The language of the law indicates a power to deal with conditions, and the only qualification on the exercise of power is that it shall be exercised in the formation of brigades as far as practicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">It is the duty of the officer, whoever he may be, to organize the Army as far as practicable into divisions of three brigades, each brigade to be composed of three or more regiments. The officer whose duty it is to organize the force under his command is to exercise his power in the organization in good faith, having in view the highest efficiency of his force, and having divisions composed of three brigades, and each brigade to be composed of three or more regiments. He is compelled to deal with the force as he finds it in attaining the purpose of the statute, in having it organized into divisions, and if practicable to have such divisions composed of brigades having the full complement of three or more regiments.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-7\">He must meet the requirements of the law as near as he can, and the presumption of law is that the organization was effected upon that line of organization. It is conceded that the claimant was assigned in orders by competent authority to the command for which he is now claiming additional compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-8\">In answer, therefore, to the first inquiry it is not necessary that the claimant should have commanded three regiments organized with twelve companies, and each company organized as contemplated by section 2 of the act of April 26, 1898 (30 Stat. L., 364).</p>\n<p id=\"b366-9\">The substance of the second inquiry is, Can the accounting officers go behind the authority assigning the claimant to the command of a brigade and inquire as to the number of regiments composing the alleged brigade?</p>\n<p id=\"b366-10\">This presents a most difficult question of administrative law, as it affects the various departments of the Government in the adjustment of the pecuniary liabilities of the United States. Under the peculiar phraseology of the ninth section of the act 22d of April, 1898 <em>(supra), </em>the court decides that the accounting officers have no power to inquire into the wis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>dom, expediency, or necessity of assigning an officer to a command above that appertaining to his grade; but it is competent for the accounting officers to inquire whether the order of assignment to higher command was carried into effect according to law, and to what extent the officer performed the service to which he was assigned.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">In answer to the third inquiry, the substance of which is, What is to be termed a brigade within the purview of the law granting pay for exercising a higher command? This question is answered, as applicable to this case by the substance of the act of April 22,1898, and may be stated as follows: A brigade consists of three regiments or more, or as near thereto as it is practicable to be organized with the material of troops available under the peculiar circumstances of each condition. It is not an absolute and determined quantity, but of three full regiments or more where it is practicable to have it organized up to that maximum.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">The fourth inquiry is in substance, Is it necessary, in order to recover pay for the higher command, that the force commanded by claimant should be up to the maximum of twelve organized companies ?' The answer to the first inquiry sufficiently answers this inquiry in the negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-7\">In answer to the fifth inquiry, the court decides that the claimant is entitled to recover the pay of a brigadier-general for the period indicated in the findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-8\">The claimant, in his petition filed under the reference by the Secretary of the Treasuiy, claims a judgment under the thirteenth section of the act of March 3, 1887 (24 Stat. L., 505), entitled \u201cAn act to provide for the bringing of suits against the Government of the United States,\u201d and in pursuance of the thirteenth section of that act, the court awards a judgment in favor of the claimant for the sum of $311.10. A copy of the findings of the court, with a copy of this opinion, will be transmitted to the Secretary of the Treasury for the guidance and action of that Department.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
