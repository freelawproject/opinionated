The brig- Luc3r, John Clapp, master, on or about March 11, 1798, sailed on a commercial voyage\u2019from Demarara for New London, Conn. On her outward voyage she had cleared from New London, Conn., for Surinam, a neutral port, laden with a cargo of horses and mules, which she conveyed to Demarara, a British possession. The outward-bound cargo belonged to the owners of the vessel.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b204-7\">On March 24, 1798, while peacefully pursuing said vojmge, said vessel was seized on the. high seas liy the French privateer L\u2019Amour de la Patrie, Williams, master, and taken into St. Johns, Porto Rico, where said vessel and cargo were after-wards condemned and sold by decree of the tribunal of commerce at Basse-Terre, Guadeloupe, whereby both vessel and cargo became a total loss to the owners thereof.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b204-8\">The grounds of condemnation, as stated in the decree, were as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b204-9\">\u201c Hearing the report of the president and the requisition of the commissioner, considering the brig in question was cleared for Surinam, when she has been to Demarara, carrying thither a cargo of mules and horses.

The New Haven Insurance Company, a corporation duly organized under the laws of the State of Connecticut, on March 19,1798, insured Jeremiah Wadsworth and James Burr, through Edward Danforth, in the sum of \u00a71,400 on the cargo of said voyage, at a premium of $350, and afterwards said company paid the sum of $1,372, being the amount of said insurance less the customary abatement, wherebjr said company became subrogated to the rights of the insured to the extent of said payment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b205-17\">VIII.

J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Ai\">delivered the opinion of the court:</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">In this case the owners of the vessel were the owners of the cargo. The outward-bound cargo, carried from an American port to a British (belligerent) port, consisted of horses.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-7\">Horses belong to that disputable class of merchandise which may or may not be contraband, according to the circumstances of a case. Where they may be serviceable to the military forces, of the belligerent they are contraband; where they are clearly for the use of the noncombatant portion of a community they form an innocent <em>cargo. </em>Whether' they were or were not contraband was frequently \u2014 was almost invariably\u2014 a-vexed question during the eighteenth century in prize cases. <em>{The Atlantic, </em>present term.)</p>\n<p id=\"b206-8\">The treaty with France of February 6. 1778 (8 Stat. L., p. 12, Art. xxiv), without reservation or qualification declares horses to bo contraband. The only purpose which the court can ascribe to the treaty is that the high contracting parties designed to make that certain which before was uncertain\u2014 to remove a cause of dispute from the future determination of prize courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-9\">The seizure and condemnation of the vessel and cargo in this case were in March, 1798. The voyage therefore came within the restrictions of the treaty, and the court is not at liberty now to inquire into the circumstances of the importation, but must hold that the outward-bound cargo was contraband.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-10\">Where the owners of a vessel were the owners of the cargo, the vessel as well as the cargo was subject to confiscation; and where the vessel carrying contraband was falsely documented, or cleared for a false destination, or was guilty of fraud, the liability to confiscation attended the entire voj'uge; that is to say, from the home port back to the home port, and to the cargo on the return voyage, though it might be innocent. There can be no doubt but that such was the recognized law of nations at the close of the eighteenth century. <em>(The </em>Joseph, 8 Cranch, 451-454; <em>Carrington </em>v. <em>Merchants' Insurance Co., </em>8 Peters R., 494-520.)</p>\n<p id=\"b207-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>In this case it appears by the decree that the vessel cleared for Surinam, a neutral port, but carried her contraband cargo to Demarara, a belligerent port. Neither the protest of the master, nor any document or evidence produced by the claimants, rebuts or tends to rebut the recitals of the decree. The court must therefore declare that the seizure and condemnation of the vessel and cargo were not illegal and that the owners were not entitled to indemnity. The case will be so reported to Congress, together with a copy of this opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
