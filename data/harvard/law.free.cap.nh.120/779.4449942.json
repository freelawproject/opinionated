He received a letter of discharge from the county commissioners dated October 31, 1979, effective ten days following its receipt. He died on November 5, 1979, prior to the expiration of the ten-day-notice period. At no time did the county suspend or terminate his compensation. His estate does not claim the denial of any benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-13\">On November 13, 1979, the estate of Alfred Kelley, claiming that death prior to official termination of employment does not prevent the estate from appealing the termination proceedings under RSA 28:10-a (Supp. 1979) (Discharge From Employment), filed a notice of appeal with the county personnel committee. A hearing was held on December 17, 1979, and the committee refused to take evidence, concluding that \u201c[d]ue to the death . . . before termination the . . . issue [was] moot.\u201d Motions for rehearing and to vacate the discharge were denied. Pursuant to RSA 28:10-a (Supp. 1979) the estate appealed in accordance with RSA ch. 541.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-14\">Because the decedent died when he was still a paid county employee and his future suspension had not taken effect, we agree with the personnel committee that the matter is moot. <em>Marshall v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"780\">*780</page-number><em>Thalasinos, </em>116 N.H. 671, 366 A.2d 212 (1976); <em>State v.
