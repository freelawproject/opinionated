We hold that he is.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-16\">Mrs. Ruth W. Holmes was injured by a hydraulic press while employed at International Packings Corporation in Bristol, New Hampshire. After collecting workmen\u2019s compensation, she brought an action in July 1978 against Roger Young, a fellow employee. New Hampshire is one of only fourteen states that permit such actions. <em>Stevens v. Lewis, </em>118 N.H. 367, 368, 387 A.2d 637, 638 (1978). <em>See </em>RSA 281:12 (Supp. 1979). As did the plaintiff in the <em>Stevens </em>case, Mrs. Holmes alleged that Young was in charge of plant safety and that he breached that duty by failing to provide a safe place for her to work.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-17\">The insurance carrier denied coverage and Young filed a petition for declaratory judgment under RSA 491:22. The Master, <em>Robert A. Carignan, </em>Esq., ruled in the plaintiff\u2019s favor. <em>DiClerico, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"883\">*883</page-number>J. approved the recommendation that the carrier was to provide coverage for Mrs. Holmes\u2019 action. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-5\">International Packings Corporation (IPC) is a New Hampshire company that makes rubber seals and parts primarily for the automotive industry. The manufacturing process at the plant in Bristol, where Roger Young serves as plant manager, involves the use of many large, complex machines. Young\u2019s managerial duties place upon him the responsibility to supervise directly three foremen and forty employees. As safety officer, Young is head of the safety committee and is responsible for compliance with regulations of the United States Occupational Safety &amp; Health Administration and the United States Environmental Protection Agency. Young also was involved in the purchase and construction of other plants. On his own signature, he has bound the corporation to contracts with machinery contractors and other tradesmen.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-6\">The retired treasurer of IPC, James Clowes, purchased the 121-page insurance policy at issue. Section II provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b901-7\">\u201cPERSONS INSURED</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b901-8\">Each of the following is an insured under this insurance to the extent set forth below:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b901-9\">(c) if the named insured is designated in the declarations as other than an individual, partnership or joint venture, the organization so designated and <em>any executive officer, </em>director or stockholder thereof while acting within the scope of his duties as such;\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b901-10\">Clowes stated his opinion that an \u201cexecutive officer\u201d would have, as did Young, authority \u201cto hire, fire, get things done in his department.\u201d It was Clowes\u2019 belief that the policy he purchased covered Young, and the president of IPC also testified that he expected the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-11\">The policy does not define \u201cexecutive officer.\u201d The definition of \u201cexecutive officer\u201d in Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 794-95 (Unabridged 1961) is \u201cthe military officer second in command of a company or similar organization.\u201d Obviously, that will not aid us. Using the same dictionary, under the word \u201cexecutive\u201d we find: \u201cone who holds a position of administrative or managerial responsibility in a business or other organization.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 794. A \u201ccorporate officer,\u201d on the other hand, is a more precise and narrow definition tied to the corporate charter and bylaws. 2 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"884\">*884</page-number>W. Fletcher, Cyclopedia of the Law of Private Corporations \u00a7\u00a7 269-70 (rev. perm. ed. 1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b902-5\">It is little wonder that some courts have concluded that the insurance policy term \u201cexecutive officer\u201d is ambiguous. <em>E.g., Guillory v. Aetna Insurance Company, </em>415 F.2d 650, 652 (5th Cir. 1969); <em>Holm v. Mutual Service Cas. Ins. Co., </em>261 N.W.2d 598, 600 (Minn. 1977); <em>see Hadrick v. Diaz, </em>302 So. 2d 345, 352 (La. App. 1974); <em>Berry v. Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Company, </em>240 So. 2d 243, 246 (La. App. 1970), <em>cert. denied, </em>401 U.S. 1005 (1971). The <em>Berry </em>case involved a suit by a fellow employee against a plant manager and a personnel director, among others. At the outset, the Court observed,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b902-6\">\u201cIt is clear the term \u2018executive officer\u2019 covers something more than, and is not restricted to, \u2018corporate officers\u2019. If not, certainly the insurance company . . . would have used that terminology.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b902-7\"><em>Berry v. Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Company, supra </em>at 246.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-8\"> We recently adopted the majority rule that in \u201ccases where policy language is ambiguous or when separate clauses lend themselves to conflicting interpretations, . . . ambiguous language is construed against the insurer.\u201d <em>Trombly v. Blue Cross/Blue Shield of New Hampshire-Vermont, </em>120 N.H. 764, 423 A.2d 980 (1980). We did so on the basis that \u201c[o]ne of the most frequently articulated rationales for the rule is based on the fact that it is the insurer who controls the language of the policy and, therefore, any resulting ambiguity should be resolved in favor of the insured.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 771, 423 A.2d at 984. Having adopted the majority rule, we apply it in this case and uphold the decision below requiring the carrier to defend Mr. Young.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-9\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b902-10\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
