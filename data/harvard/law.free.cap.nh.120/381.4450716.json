As there was no allegation or showing of juror bias or prejudice in this case, we hold that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>court did not abuse its discretion in denying the plaintiffs motion in this case. In the future, however, the granting of similar requests might reduce the potential for mistrials or appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-4\">\n<em>Exception overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
