We affirm the court\u2019s decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>On petition of Bessie C. Bradlee, the Hillsborough County Probate Court (Copadis, J.) in November 1976 appointed Penelope Carbee as her conservator. The petition was accompanied by the required physician\u2019s statement certifying that Bradlee was \u201ccapable of fully understanding the nature and purport of her petition for the appointment of a conservator of her property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b449-3\">On petition of Carbee dated June 2, 1977, the probate court issued her a license to sell Bradlee\u2019s real estate. This license was issued on June 13, 1977, and contained the following language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-4\">Your Petitioner seeks to sell and convey these premises to <em>Penelope D. Carbee and Walter Sterling </em>of said Hillsborough as tenants in common for the sum of Twenty Thousand Dollars ($20,000.00) subject to and assuming the present outstanding balance of the mortgage from Bessie C. Bradlee to The Bank of New Hampshire.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">(Emphasis added.) The balance of the mortgage referred to was less than four thousand dollars. On August 17, 1977, Carbee, as conservator, executed a deed conveying her ward\u2019s property to herself <em>only </em>and recorded the deed on August 25, 1977.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">Bradlee died on November 9, 1977. Frank Sylvia was then appointed administrator of her estate. As administrator, he filed with the court an objection to the conservator\u2019s accounting and sale of the real estate. He alleged that the real estate had been sold to Carbee individually, and not to her and Sterling as described in the license. He also alleged that the amount that the property had been sold for, $20,000 and the assumption of the mortgage, was inadequate consideration, as evidenced by the fact that it was being offered for resale for more than $100,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-7\">The license to sell was returned and filed with the court on October 3, 1978, indicating that the conservator had sold the property to herself in her private capacity. The probate court ordered a hearing on the conservator\u2019s first and final account, and also ordered her to show cause why the granting of the petition to sell real estate to herself should not be vacated. Following a hearing on January 16, 1979, <em>Copadis, </em>J. ruled that Bradlee was not competent at the time of the conservator\u2019s appointment and vacated Carbee\u2019s license to sell Bradlee\u2019s real estate. Carbee appealed from this decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-8\">The first issue is whether a probate court has authority to vacate a conservator\u2019s license to sell real estate. We hold that it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>does, and that it may exercise that authority whenever it deems it appropriate and in the best interests of the ward. RSA 547:3, :4, 559:18 (Supp. 1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">The second issue is whether the conservator\u2019s deviation from the terms of her license to sell real estate was sufficient to render a conveyance under that license invalid. The probate court granted Carbee a license to sell and convey the real estate in question to \u201cPenelope D. Carbee and Walter Sterling ... as tenants in common.\u201d Carbee in fact sold and conveyed the real estate to herself alone. We find this deviation to be significant and sufficient to invalidate the conveyance.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">Carbee argues that the deviation from the terms of the license was insignificant and did not result in injury to the ward, and that the conveyance was therefore valid. In the context of the administrator\u2019s allegations and the facts before us, however, the deviation can be found to have resulted in injury to the ward. The probate court stated that in granting the license it \u201crelied upon the fact, that the sale was to be, not only to the fiduciary but to a stranger to the conservatorship which would have negated any presumption of invalidity.\u201d Because the record supports a finding that the deviation was significant, we uphold the court\u2019s decree rendering the conveyance to Carbee invalid. <em>See Bourgeois v. Town of Bedford, </em>120 N.H. 145, 412 A.2d 1021 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b450-7\">\n<em>Affirmed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b450-8\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
