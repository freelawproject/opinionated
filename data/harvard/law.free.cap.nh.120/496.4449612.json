Officer Perkins observed the defendant\u2019s performance on certain field sobriety tests and arrested him for DWI. RSA 262-A:62. At the police station, the defendant refused to take the breathalyzer test. On March 19, 1979, the District Court <em>(Brighton, </em>J.) tried the defendant for DWI, found him guilty, and fined him $150 plus a fifteen dollar penalty assessment. The court also revoked the defendant\u2019s license for a period that cannot be determined from the record and ordered him to attend six classes at the Community Alcohol Information Program (CAIP). The defendant appealed to Hillsborough County Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-10\">Pending his appeal, the defendant began attending CAIP classes and became familiar with a widely used wallet-size mathematical chart, distributed by the State of New Hampshire, that relates the number of drinks consumed to body weight and gives the probable BAC to two decimal places. He was taught that the BAC \u201cburns off\u2019 at a rate of .015 percent per hour.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-11\">At his trial in superior court on October 1, 1979, the defendant testified that before his arrest he had consumed six drinks between 8:30 p.m. and 12:30 a.m. Defense counsel then asked him what his BAC was at the time of his arrest. The State objected and the defense offered to prove that the defendant could, through use of the standard mathematical formula, calculate what his BAC probably would have been at 1:00 a.m. if he had consumed six drinks over the preceding four and one-half hours. Defense counsel told the court that the defendant would testify that according to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>the chart, taking into account his body weight, the number of drinks allegedly consumed and the \u201cburn-off\u201d rate, his BAC at the time of arrest would have been approximately .054. Under RSA 262-A:63, evidence of such a BAC is relevant to the issue of intoxication, but it is not dispositive. The Court <em>(Goode, </em>J.) sustained the State\u2019s objection to the offered evidence and noted the defendant\u2019s exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">The jury found the defendant guilty and the court increased his sentence from the $150 fine imposed in district court to $750 plus the 10% statutory fee. The court also stayed execution of the sentence pending appeal to this court but required $200 bail to be posted.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">The defendant now contends that the trial court erred in refusing to admit the offered evidence relating to probable BAC at the time of arrest. The State does not challenge the basic reliability of the procedure by which the defendant calculated his probable BAC. The State\u2019s argument stems from the absence, present in <em>Chalmers v. Harris Motors, </em>104 N.H. 111, 179 A.2d 447 (1962) and <em>State v. Baron, </em>98 N.H. 298, 99 A.2d 912 (1953), of any blood test type of BAC measurement. It contends that this absence of a \u201cbaseline\u201d figure renders the offered evidence so speculative and unreliable as to be inadmissible. We reject this argument. The fact that no one scientifically measured the defendant\u2019s BAC at any time on the night in question does not rob the offered proof of \u201csome tendency to establish a fact of consequence to the determination of the action.\u201d <em>Welch v. Bergeron, </em>115 N.H. 179, 182, 337 A.2d 341, 343 (1975); J. McCormick, <em>Evidence </em>\u00a7 185, at 437 <em>(E. Cleary </em>ed. 1972). In our opinion, the absence of such a baseline measurement affected only the weight of the defendant\u2019s evidence and not its admissibility. The jury heard the defendant testify that he had six drinks (rather than the usual \u201ctwo beers\u201d) between 8:30 p.m. and 12:30 a.m. Armed with that knowledge, the jury was entitled to hear evidence that would have enabled them to approximate the defendant\u2019s BAC at the time of arrest. The evidence was not inadmissible merely because it was less probative on the issue of intoxication than it would have been had a scientific BAC measurement been taken. \u201c[EJvidence having any tendency, however slight, to prove a particular fact is competent proof of the fact.\u201d <em>Mason v. Railway, </em>79 N.H. 300, 303, 109 A. 841, 843 (1919); <em>Curtis v. Laconia Car Co. Works, 73 </em>N.H. 516, 63 A. 400 (1906); <em>see State v. Gallant, </em>108 N.H. 72, 227 A.2d 597 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b516-8\">The statute that discusses BAC evidence and its legal effects (RSA 262-A:63), provides that the section <em>\u201cshall not be construed </em>as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number><em>limiting </em>the introduction of any other competent evidence bearing upon the question <em>whether or not </em>the defendant was under the influence of intoxicating liquor.\u201d (Emphasis added.) We hold that because the evidence offered in this case was competent and relevant to the issue of the defendant\u2019s alleged intoxication, it was necessarily admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">The defendant also challenges the superior court\u2019s imposition of a sentence five times greater than that imposed at the district court level. Though our remand renders this question at least temporarily moot, we discuss it because of the possibility that the defendant\u2019s new trial might again result in a conviction. Our sentencing statute, RSA ch. 651, and our case law, <em>see, e.g., State v. Wentworth, </em>118 N.H. 832, 395 A.2d 858 (1978) and <em>State v. Streeter, </em>113 N.H. 402, 308 A.2d 535 (1973), make clear that sentencing is within the discretion of the trial court unless the sentence is grossly disproportionate to the crime. N.H. Const. pt. 1, art. 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\"> Unexplained <em>substantial </em>increases in sentences do not comport with sound judicial policy. Hereafter, whenever the superior court, after a trial de novo, <em>substantially </em>increases a sentence imposed by the lower court, the record must reflect the reasons for the change. N.H. Const. pt. 2, art. 73-A.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-7\">Finally, the defendant contends that the court inexplicably and erroneously required him to post $200 bail pending his appeal to this court. In this State the conditions for release on personal recognizance prior to conviction are set by statute.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-8\">\u201c[RSA] 597:6-a <em>Conditions for Release on Personal Recognizance. </em>Any person shall be eligible for, <em>and in the case of a misdemeanor, shall be entitled to, </em>release on personal recognizance upon satisfying the court or bail commissioner before whom he seeks release, of the following conditions:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-9\">I. That he is of such condition, both physical and mental, that his release will jeopardize neither himself nor the public;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-10\">II. That his employment, family ties, and residence within the state or other sufficient connection with the state make his failure to appear unlikely;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-11\">III. That he has not, prior to his application, failed to appear in any court when required to do so;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>IV. That no other special circumstance exists creating a likelihood that he would fail to appear.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">(Emphasis added.) There is no evidence before us that the trial court found that the defendant failed to satisfy any of the four statutory conditions. <em>See Daneker v. State, </em>117 N.H. 380, 373 A.2d 1322 (1977). Further, the defendant states in his brief \u2014 and it is unchallenged in the State\u2019s answering brief \u2014 that defense counsel requested and was denied the opportunity to present evidence relating to the defendant\u2019s statutory fitness for release on personal recognizance. We note, finally, that the defendant, a New Hampshire resident, had appeared for two prior trials in this matter before the question of bail on appeal arose.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">Following conviction, RSA 597:l-a comes into play and provides, as relevant here, for personal recognizance or bail \u201cunless there is a substantial risk\u201d of failure to appear, intimidation of witnesses, etc. We can see no reason for other than personal recognizance in a routine DWI case appealed to this court by a New Hampshire resident, and therefore find the bail set without hearing to have been excessive. <em>See </em>N.H. Const. pt. 1, art. 33; <em>State v. Adams, </em>116 N.H. 529, 363 A.2d 410 (1976); <em>cf. State v. Marini, </em>117 N.H. 71, 369 A.2d 202 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b518-7\">\n<em>Remanded for new trial.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
