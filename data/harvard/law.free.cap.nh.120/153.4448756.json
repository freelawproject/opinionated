The mother and her guardian ad litem have objected to the order on the grounds that it violates her fifth amendment rights and her rights under part 1, article 15 of the New Hampshire Constitution not to give testimony against herself. They have also objected to the order on the grounds that the probate court lacked the authority at the time of its order to compel a psychiatric examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-15\">On August 11,1978, the Concord District Court found that the child in question was a neglected child, awarded temporary custody to the New Hampshire Division of Welfare and ordered the mother to undergo psychiatric evaluation. On November 2,1978, the division of welfare petitioned the Merrimack County Probate Court to terminate parental rights under RSA 170-C:5 IV alleging that the \u201cFemale Adult is incapable of providing proper parental care to her son due to Female Adult\u2019s mental illness.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b173-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>On December 21,1978, the division filed a motion for a psychiatric evaluation in the probate court \u201cto determine whether because of mental deficiency or mental illness the Petitionee is and will continue to be incapable of giving the child proper parental care and protection for a longer period of time than would be wise or prudent to leave the child in an unstable or impermanent environment.\u201d Following a hearing on the motion, the Probate Court (.Burlingame, J.) ordered the mother, over objection and exception, to make herself available for evaluation by two licensed psychiatrists or psychologists.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">The first issue is whether the probate court had authority to order psychiatric evaluations. Effective August 21, 1979, N.H. Laws 1979, 332:2 amends RSA ch. 170-C by inserting, after section 9, language that confers on the probate court the power to order such a psychiatric evaluation under a RSA 170-C:5 IV proceeding. The mother argues that because N.H. Laws 1979, 332:2 (RSA 170-C:9-a) was applied to an order issued prior to the effective date of that statute, the probate court allowed the retrospective application of the statute in contravention of part 1, article 23 of the New Hampshire Constitution. Because N.H. Laws 1979,332:2 is procedural, we find its application to the court\u2019s order of March 19,1979, not in violation of the mother\u2019s constitutional rights. <em>Riesenberg v. State, </em>115 N.H. 12, 13, 332 A.2d 393, 394 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">The second issue is whether a compelled psychiatric examination ordered in a proceeding to terminate parental rights under RSA 170-C:5 IV abridges a parent\u2019s constitutional rights. The mother argues that her fifth amendment privilege against self-incrimination is violated if she is forced to submit to a psychiatric examination. Although this right is not restricted to criminal trials, the right may be invoked only if disclosure could be incriminating or if it could lead to incriminating evidence. <em>Malloy v. Hogan, </em>378 U. S. 1, 12 (1963); <em>In re Green, </em>14 Wash. App. 939, 944, 546 P.2d 1230, 1233 (1976); <em>see In re Gault, </em>387 U.S. 1, 47-48 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b173-7\">The mother in this instance does not claim fear of criminal prosecution; rather, she claims that an evaluation based on her testimony would be used to take away other constitutionally protected rights. We find neither merit nor authority to apply the privilege in this context, and therefore, find no violation of the mother\u2019s right against self-incrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-8\">The mother next argues that a court order compelling an involuntary psychiatric examination under RSA 170-C:9-a violates her right to enjoy life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>violates her fundamental rights of freedom from restraint and personal privacy. This court has recognized that the family and the rights of parents over it are fundamental and inherent within the federal and our own State constitutions. <em>State v. Robert H., </em>118 N.H. 713, 393 A.2d 1387 (1978). To protect these rights, this court has ruled that in order to terminate them under RSA ch. 170, the State must prove its case \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 716, 393 A.2d at 1389.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">In many termination proceedings, the State might be unable to meet its burden if the parent simply refuses to undergo psychiatric evaluation. Even in the case of a neglect proceeding, in which this court has held the standard of proof to be \u201cby clear and convincing evidence,\u201d it was also held that psychiatric evidence, including testimony of a treating psychiatrist, would be admissible notwithstanding a claim of statutory privilege because without this evidence \u201cthe State [would] be unable to bear its burden of proof.\u201d <em>In re Brenda H., </em>119 N.H. 382, 402 A.2d 169 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\"> Because a parent\u2019s mental incapacity affects the parent\u2019s ability to care for the child and, therefore, may constitute grounds for termination, the issue of admissibility of psychiatric tests involves the protected rights of the child. Specifically, the State seeks to protect the best interests of the child by removing him from an environment in which \u201cthe parent is and will continue to be incapable of giving the child proper parental care and protection for a longer period of time than would be wise or prudent to leave the child in an unstable or impermanent environment.\u201d The dominant consideration of the court in these proceedings should be the welfare of the child, which must prevail over conflicting rights of the parent. <em>In re Green supra </em>at 945, 546 P.2d at 1234. Allowing the probate court the discretion to compel a psychiatric examination helps protect the child\u2019s welfare by permitting the acquisition of information essential to the disposition of proceedings to terminate parental rights. Without this information, the court might be unable to determine whether parental rights should be terminated, <em>In re Brenda H. supra, </em>and children would remain with parents who could not properly provide for their welfare. Accordingly, we hold that if the issue of mental illness of a parent is properly raised under RSA ch. 170-C, and if a preliminary showing bearing adversely on the question of parental mental illness is made, the best interests of the child dictate that the parent submit to a court-ordered psychiatric evaluation.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-7\">We do not rule that Laws 1979, 332:2 grants unrestricted power to order psychiatric examinations in all proceedings to terminate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>parental rights. In the instant case, however, based upon the testimony of both a physician and a social worker who had observed the female adult, and based upon her persistent attempts to treat and dress her son as a girl, the probate court properly found cause to order the psychiatric studies.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-4\">We hold that N.H. Laws 1979,332:2 will not be invoked in every proceeding to terminate parental rights, but only where reasonable cause exists. In its motion, the division of welfare alleged \u201creasonable cause\u201d to order the psychiatric examination. Here, in the context of a petition filed under RSA 170-C:5 IV, the cause justifying the examination is especially compelling. We therefore affirm the probate court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">\n<em>Appeal dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b175-6\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
