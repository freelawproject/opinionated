The Concord District Court committed him to the Adolescent Unit of the New Hampshire Hospital pursuant to RSA 169:9 for examination and evaluation. Following a recommendation that he remain for treatment, the district court ordered placement at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>hospital pursuant to RSA 169:13-a 1(d). The notice and hearing requirements of RSA 169:17-a and RSA 169:18 were not followed. An appeal was taken to the superior court which, after a hearing, was dismissed by <em>DiClerico, </em>J. The juvenile then appealed to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-4\">The juvenile claims that his commitment under RSA 169:13-a 1(d) was illegal. However, the State has now obtained a committal of the juvenile to the hospital in accordance with RSA ch. 135-B and we are informed that the district court has rescinded its order. The case is therefore moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">\n<em>Appeal dismissed as moot.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b305-6\">Douglas, J., did not sit.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
