Carlino, </em>119 N.H. 126, 129, 399 A.2d 292, 295 (1979). On remand, the Court <em>(Copadis, </em>J.) conducted a hearing and found that the witness was unavailable and was \u201cnot a credible witness within the meaning of RSA 551:2.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b507-16\">However, the court granted proponent\u2019s request #13 that \u201cBlakesley was not incompetent at the time of her attestation.\u201d This presents a seeming inconsistency because the word \u201ccredible\u201d within the context of RSA 551:2 means competent. <em>Ross v. Carlino supra; Eustis v. Parker, </em>1 N.H. 273, 274 (1818). We were of the opinion that we made this clear when the case was here before.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>The court granted various requests in which the phrase \u201ccredibility or competency\u201d was used. It also made several other requested findings that the witness lacked the requisite mental capacity to attest that the deceased executed the will, that she neither had knowledge of its contents nor possessed the mental capacity to sign. We are satisfied that the probate court understood \u201ccredible\u201d to mean \u201ccompetent\u201d and found that the third witness, Blakesley, did not meet the requirements of RSA 551:2. The granting of request #13 stands alone in the face of these various findings and we are satisfied that it was granted by error or through misunderstanding.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-4\">\n<em>Appeal dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
