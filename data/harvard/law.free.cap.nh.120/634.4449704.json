We hold that it did.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-20\">On the evening of December 31, 1978, Armand Aubert, the defendant\u2019s husband, attended a New Year\u2019s Eve party at a neighbor\u2019s home. At approximately 11:15 p.m., the defendant, Jean Aubert, arrived at the party. The defendant carried with her a .38 caliber revolver. She pointed the weapon at her husband and said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>\u201cDo you want it now?\u201d Mr. Aubert approached the defendant and grabbed the barrel of the gun with one hand and the back of the defendant\u2019s hair with the other. Mr. Aubert continued to hold the defendant by the back of the hair while he \u00abached to open a nearby door. The weapon somehow discharged, and a bullet struck Mr. Aubert in the face.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">The Strafford County Grand Jury indicted Jean Aubert and she was tried for attempted first-degree murder, RSA 629:1. The jury found her guilty as charged. The defendant seasonably excepted to the sufficiency of the indictment and opening statement, to certain comments made by the court, to the admission of certain evidence, to portions of the court\u2019s instruction, and to its failure to charge as requested. The Trial Court <em>{Goode, </em>J.) reserved and transferred all exceptions to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-6\"> The defendant first argues that the trial court erred in declining to charge the jury concerning the defendant\u2019s claim that the shooting was accidental. We agree. A requested charge on a party\u2019s theory of defense must be given if such theory is supported by some evidence. Refusal to charge on that defense is reversible error. <em>United States v. Tashman, </em>478 F.2d 129 (5th Cir. 1973); <em>Swain v. State, </em>583 S.W.2d 775 (Tex. 1979); C. Torcia, 4 Wharton\u2019s Criminal Procedure \u00a7 538 (12th ed. 1975). This principle applies to the defense of accident as well as to other defenses. <em>People v. Lester, </em>406 Mich. 252, 277 N.W.2d 633 (1979); <em>State v. Martin, </em>35 N.C. App. 108, 240 S.E.2d 486 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b653-7\">There was evidence produced at trial which, if believed by the jury, would support a finding that the shooting was accidental. It was established at trial that the defendant, a right-hander, carried the pistol in her left hand. A weapons expert testified that this indicated that the defendant did not intend to use the pistol. Further evidence indicated that Mr. Aubert initiated the struggle with the defendant. Expert medical testimony concerning entry and exit wounds left by the bullet supported the theory that the shooting might have been accidental. Based on the evidence presented, defense counsel requested the trial court to charge that if \u201cthe gun went off accidentally . . . you are instructed to return a verdict of not guilty.\u201d Because there was evidence to support this theory of defense, the trial court\u2019s refusal to charge the jury about the defense of accident was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-8\">The defendant next argues that the court\u2019s reasonable doubt charge was improper. We agree. The court\u2019s definition of reasonable doubt follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>\u201cNow, the phrase \u2018reasonable doubt\u2019 means exactly what those words imply. It is a doubt based upon reason arising from an impartial consideration of all the evidence offered to you. It is not a doubt which is merely fanciful. It is not a doubt which is speculative. The test you must use is as follows. If you have a reasonable doubt as to whether the State has proved any one or more of the elements of the crime charged, then you will find the defendant not guilty. However, if you find that the State has proved all of the elements of the offense charged beyond a reasonable doubt, then you will return a verdict of guilty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-5\">Now, it is not an object of this rule of proof to impose upon you the duty of looking [sic] or examining this evidence in any strange, peculiar or extraordinary way. <em>Nor </em>is it intended by this rule to impose upon the State an <em>impossible burden </em>in establishing its case. It is a matter of common knowledge to all of us that <em>absolute positive certainty </em>can almost never be attained. But bear in mind, Members of the Jury, that the State is not required to establish guilt beyond <em>all </em>doubt. That is not the State\u2019s burden. The State is not required to establish guilt to a <em>mathematical certainty. </em>That is not the State\u2019s burden. <em>Neither </em>is the State required to establish guilt to a <em>scientific certainty. </em>The State\u2019s burden is fully met when it has established guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b654-7\">The first paragraph of the court\u2019s instruction is virtually identical to the reasonable doubt definition delineated in the model charge suggested by this court in <em>State v. Wentworth, </em>118 N.H. 832, 395 A.2d 858 (1978), and upheld by the federal court in <em>Tsoumas v. State of New Hampshire, </em>611 F.2d 412 (1st Cir. 1980). However, the trial court attempted to further define the concept of reasonable doubt. We have repeatedly criticized such efforts. <em>See, e.g., State v. Donovan, </em>120 N.H. 603, 419 A.2d 1102 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b654-8\">In the instant case, the second paragraph of the court\u2019s charge overly favored the prosecution. The trial court instructed that \u201cabsolute positive certainty can almost never be attained\u201d but that \u201cthe state is not required to establish guilt beyond all doubt.\u201d While this statement may not be technically erroneous, very similar language has been criticized for favoring the prosecution. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number><em>See United States v. Shaffner, </em>524 F.2d 1021 (7th Cir. 1975). Further, the United States Supreme Court has indicated that the reasonable doubt instruction should impress upon the finder of fact the need to reach a \u201csubjective state of near certitude\u201d on the facts at issue. <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 315 (1979). <em>See In re Winship, </em>397 U.S. 358, 364 (1970). The trial court\u2019s repeated emphasis that the State need not establish guilt to a mathematical certainty, and need not establish guilt to a scientific certainty, and need not establish guilt beyond all doubt violated the spirit of that standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">This court designed the model charge to even-handedly define the concept of reasonable doubt. The trial court began with the <em>Wentworth </em>model, but thereafter concluded with several statements that can only be described as pro-State, thus creating an imbalance in the reasonable doubt charge. We hold that such imbalance resulted in an impermissible reduction of the prosecution\u2019s burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-6\">This court is acutely aware of the problems inherent in attempting to define an amorphous concept like reasonable doubt. The Court of Appeals for the First Circuit has stated that reasonable doubt is at best a difficult concept to explain to a lay jury. <em>Dunn v. Perrin, </em>570 F.2d 21 (1st Cir. 1978). Judging from the increasing amount of litigation coming to us on the issue, this is an understatement of the difficult task confronting a trial court. Often, attempts to define reasonable doubt result in jury instructions that have been characterized by playwright Channing Pollock as a \u201cgrand conglomeration of garbled verbiage and verbal garbage.\u201d J. O\u2019Mara, <em>Standard Jury Charges </em>\u2014 Findings <em>of Pilot Project, </em>43 Penn B.A.Q. 166 (1972). At least one court sought to avoid such a result by discouraging or even prohibiting their judges from defining reasonable doubt, preferring to let the words define themselves. <em>See Orrill v. State, </em>509 P.2d 930 (Okla. Crim. App. 1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b655-7\">Though we acknowledge the difficulty inherent in the task, this court feels strongly that a jury must be given some assistance in understanding the concept. We feel that there is merit in the belief that the definition of reasonable doubt is perhaps the most important aspect of the closing instruction to a jury in a criminal trial. <em>See Dunn v. Perrin, </em>570 F.2d at 25. Because this court is cognizant of the need for a reasonable doubt definition, and at the same time acknowledges the complex problems in attempting to define the concept, we feel that the rationale behind our model charge has become more compelling. Litigation concerning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>reasonable doubt charges has mounted. <em>See State v. Donovan, </em>120 N.H. 603, 419 A.2d 1102 (1980). The decisions we are forced to make on a myriad of reasonable doubt definitions requires a difficult, subjective weighing process. This court is determined that decisions in this area should be consistent, and not appear arbitrary or capricious. The use of the model instruction set forth in <em>Wentworth </em>will provide a balanced definition of reasonable doubt, will reduce needless litigation, and most importantly will insure the application of a uniform standard for juries weighing the evidence presented in trial courts throughout the State until such time as we adopt pattern jury instructions. For these reasons, we now request that trial judges not add to the model charge set forth in <em>State v. Wentworth.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b656-4\">Because the trial court\u2019s jury instruction constituted reversible error, it is unnecessary to consider further exceptions made by the defendant. We remand for a new trial consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">\n<em>Remanded for retrial.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b656-6\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
