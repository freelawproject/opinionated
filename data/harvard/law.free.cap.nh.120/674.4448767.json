Whittum, </em>Esq.) found that the zoning board\u2019s denial of the plaintiff\u2019s request for a variance was unjust and unreasonable. He granted the request, and the Superior Court <em>(Mullavey, </em>J.) approved the decree. The city filed a notice of appeal pursuant to Supreme Court Rule 7, but it did not move to set aside the decree below or request findings and rulings. The city briefed issues related to sufficiency of evidence in the case below, but did not file a motion for nonsuit or directed verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-16\">Supreme Court Rule 3 provides that an \u201cappeal\u201d constitutes \u201c[a]ppellate review of a party\u2019s exceptions, after a final decision on the merits in a lower court.\u201d In <em>Garland &amp; LaChance Constr. Co. v. City of Keene, </em>117 N.H. 920, 379 A.2d 1259 (1977), the losing party did not request findings and rulings or file an exception to the master\u2019s report. In that case there was a motion to set aside the verdict which permitted a review of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-17\">There being no exception before us, the order is</p>\n<p id=\"b692-18\">\n<em>Dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
