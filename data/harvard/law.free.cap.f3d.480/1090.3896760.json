Danley contends that he was subjected to excessive force and then denied medical treatment when, as a pretrial detainee, detention officers sprayed him with pepper spray. The defendant-appellants contend that they are entitled to qualified immunity from Danley\u2019s claims. The district court entered one-sentence orders denying each of the various motions to dismiss. The district court\u2019s one-sentence orders perfunctorily stated that the district court had considered the motions and was \u201cof the opinion defendants\u2019 motions are due to be denied.\u201d The orders are devoid of any facts and any legal analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b1137-16\">Many times, and in many contexts, this Court has admonished district courts that their orders should contain sufficient explanations of their rulings so as to provide this Court with an opportunity to engage in meaningful appellate review. <em>See Clay v. Equifax, Inc., </em>762 F.2d 952, 957-58 (11th Cir.1985) (collecting cases in which the Supreme Court and this Court\u2019s predecessor Court \u201curged the district court to state the reason for its decision and the underlying predicate\u201d); <em>see also Serra Chevrolet, Inc. v. General Motors Corp., </em>446 F.3d 1137, 1151 (11th Cir.2006) (in imposing sanctions, district court must clearly state its reasons so that meaningful review may be had on appeal); <em>In re Ford Motor Co., </em>345 F.3d 1315, 1317 (11th Cir.2003) (granting petition for writ of mandamus where district court \u201cprovided no substantive explanation\u201d for its discovery ruling); <em>Broadwater v. United States, </em>292 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1092\">*1092</page-number>F.3d 1302, 1303 (11th Cir.2002) (in view of size of record and number of allegations, summary denial of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion was inappropriate).</p>\n<p id=\"b1138-4\">In this case, we conclude that the district court\u2019s one-sentence summary denials of defendant-appellants\u2019 motions to dismiss wholly fail to provide this Court with an opportunity to conduct meaningful appellate review. While this Court certainly could review the record and applicable case law and render a reasoned decision on the qualified immunity issue, this is the responsibility of the district court in the first instance. Accordingly, we vacate the district court\u2019s orders denying the defendant-appellants\u2019 motions to dismiss and remand the case to the district court to consider the case in full and to enter reasoned orders which discuss the facts alleged in the second amended complaint and detail the legal analysis used by the district court to reach its conclusions regarding the motions to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b1138-5\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
