Zlotnick appeals the district court\u2019s order dismissing his suit against Premier Sales Group, Inc. (\u201cPremier\u201d), Boynton Waterways Investment Associates, LLC (\u201cBoynton Waterways\u201d), and Panther Real Estate Partners, Inc. (\u201cPanther\u201d), filed pursuant to the Florida Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices Act (\u201cFDUTPA\u201d), Fla. Stat. Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 501.201-.213. After review, we affirm the dismissal of Zlotnick\u2019s complaint for failure to state a claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1328-19\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1328-20\">On February 23, 2005, Zlotnick, a citizen of Maryland, signed a reservation agreement with Boynton Waterways, a citizen of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1283\">*1283</page-number>Florida, for a unit in a condominium complex to be built in Boynton Beach, Florida. The reservation agreement provided that payment of a $15,000 reservation deposit \u201cexpresses Purchaser\u2019s interest in purchasing Unit No. 207N (the \u2018Unit\u2019) in the proposed condominium ... at a purchase price of $310,000.\u201d The reservation agreement then stated that Boynton Waterways \u201cassures that the foregoing purchase price will be the purchase price in the contract for the sale and purchase of the Unit (the \u2018Contract\u2019) submitted to Purchaser.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1329-5\">The reservation agreement also gave both Zlotnick and Boynton Waterways the option of canceling the agreement at any time prior to entering a purchasing contract, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1329-6\">Purchaser may cancel this Reservation Agreement by notifying Seller or the Escrow Agent in a signed writing at any time before Purchaser signs the [purchase contract].... Before both Purchaser and Seller sign and deliver the [purchase contract], Seller may cancel this Agreement for any reason whatsoever, by giving written notice thereof to Purchaser and Escrow Agent, in which event the Reservation Deposit, together with any interest thereon, shall be returned to Purchaser, and thereafter Purchaser shall have no claim of any kind against Seller.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1329-7\">Moreover, the agreement states, \u201cPurchaser recognizes that this Reservation Agreement is a reservation solely with respect to a proposed condominium; and, accordingly, this Reservation Agreement is not an agreement to sell the Unit, nor does it confer any lien upon or interest in the Unit or on the proposed Condominium property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1329-8\">Zlotnick paid the reservation deposit, which was held in escrow in accordance with the reservation agreement\u2019s terms. On May 2, 2005, the contracts administrator for the condominium complex supplied Zlotnick with a copy of the reservation agreement and indicated that the purchase contracts would be completed by early June 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b1329-10\">On December 22, 2005, Boynton Waterways sent Zlotnick a letter stating that because of \u201cmeteoric increases in construction costs .... in tandem with worsening labor and material shortages resulting from Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma,\u201d Boynton Waterways could not build the condominium development at the original reservation prices. As a result, Boyn-ton Waterways canceled all reservation agreements, including Zlotnick\u2019s, and returned all deposits. The letter stated, \u201ceffective as of the date hereof, your Agreement is hereby terminated and is deemed null and void.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AOe\">On January 6, 2006, Boynton Waterways sent Zlotnick another letter announcing the reopening of the condominium sales center. The letter indicated that Zlotnick had an exclusive ten-day window to purchase the same unit he had previously reserved at the price of $370,000, a $60,000 price increase over the amount set in the 2005 reservation agreement. Zlotnick alleges that Boynton Waterways sent similar letters to all previous reservation holders for the 318 units at the condominium complex.</p>\n<p id=\"b1329-12\">On January 27, 2006, Zlotnick filed a class action complaint in federal district court under the FDUTPA on behalf of the previous reservation holders at the condominium complex. The complaint alleged that Boynton Waterways; Panther, a Florida-based real estate development company affiliated with Boynton Waterways; and Premier, a Florida-based company that marketed the condominium complex, solicited deceptive reservation agreements to secure financing and then terminated the reservation agreements with the sole <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1284\">*1284</page-number>purpose of reaping the benefits of a rising real estate market.</p>\n<p id=\"b1330-4\">Boynton Waterways, Panther, and Premier timely filed motions to dismiss for failure to state a claim. A copy of the reservation agreement was attached to the complaint, and the parties at this point do not dispute the facts in the case. After hearing oral arguments on the motions, the district court granted the motions to dismiss on May 10, 2006. <em>See Zlotnick v. Premier Sales Group, Inc., </em>431 F.Supp.2d 1290, 1296 (S.D.Fla.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b1330-5\">Zlotnick timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1330-6\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1330-7\">The FDUTPA declares that \u201cunfair or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any trade or commerce\u201d are unlawful. Fla. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 501.204(1). Pursuant to \u00a7 501.211, any person who has suffered losses as a result of a violation may commence a private action to recover actual damages, attorney\u2019s fees, and costs. Fla. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 501.211(2). The Florida Supreme Court has noted that \u201cdeception occurs if there is a representation, omission, or practice that is likely to mislead the consumer acting reasonably in the circumstances, to the consumer\u2019s detriment.\u201d <em>PNR, Inc. v. Beacon Prop. Mgmt., Inc., </em>842 So.2d 773, 777 (Fla.2003) (quotation marks and citation omitted). This standard requires a showing of \u201cprobable, not possible, deception\u201d that is \u201clikely to cause injury to a reasonable relying consumer.\u201d <em>Millennium Commc\u2019ns &amp; Fulfillment, Inc. v. Office of the Att\u2019y Gen., </em>761 So.2d 1256, 1263 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b1330-11\">Zlotnick claims that the defendants schemed to circumvent the statutory requirements in Fla. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 718.502(2)(c) governing condominium reservation agreements by canceling the reservation agreements and then offering the same units at a higher price. <em>See </em>Fla. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 718.502(2)(c) (listing terms that must be included in reservation agreements). We conclude that these allegations do not state a claim under the FDUTPA and affirm the district court\u2019s grant of the motions to dismiss.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1330-12\">It is clear that Zlotnick\u2019s reservation agreement meets all statutory requirements under Florida law. The only statutory provision at issue is the requirement that a reservation agreement must include a statement \u201cthat the purchase price represented in ... the reservation agreement will be the price in the contract for purchase and sale or that the price represented may be exceeded within a stated amount ... or that no assurance is given as to the price in the contract for purchase or sale.\u201d Fla. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 718.502(2)(c)(4).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Here, the reservation agreement states, \u201c[sjeller assures that the foregoing purchase price will be the purchase price in the contract for the sale and purchase of the Unit .... \u201d This state<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1285\">*1285</page-number>ment almost mirrors the language of Fla. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 718.502(2)(c)(4). In his reply brief, Zlotnick concedes that the reservation agreements are valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b1331-5\">However, Zlotnick argues that although the reservation agreements may have been facially valid, the defendants\u2019 scheme flouted the intent of Fla. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 718.502(2)(c)(4) by canceling the reservation agreements in order to increase prices above the price established in those initial agreements. He contends that the circumstances surrounding the reservation agreement would have misled a reasonable purchaser into believing that the purchase price listed in the reservation agreement would not be changed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1331-6\">The express terms of the reservation agreement undermine Zlotnick\u2019s claim, however. First, the language of the reservation agreement is clear on its face that it only expressed Zlotnick\u2019s \u201cinterest\u201d in purchasing a specific unit and did not constitute a guaranteed purchase contract. The reservation agreement stated that it \u201cis not an agreement to sell the Unit, nor does it confer any lien upon or interest in the Unit or on the proposed Condominium property.\u201d Furthermore, Florida courts treat reservation agreements as mere \u201cagreements to agree,\u201d not as binding purchase contracts. <em>See Portell Int\u2019l Realty, Inc. v. Jacobson, </em>802 So.2d 431, 433 (Fla. Dist.Ct.App.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b1331-7\">Additionally, the reservation agreement gave Boynton Waterways an opportunity to \u201ccancel this agreement for any reason whatsoever\u201d at any point prior to entering a purchase contract.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> While the agreement provided that \u201c[s]eller assures that the foregoing purchase price will be the purchase price in the contract for the sale and purchase of the Unit,\u201d there are no assurances that the purchase price would remain the same if Boynton Waterways canceled the reservation agreement. In light of the broad cancellation provision and express terms indicating that the agreement conferred no interest in the proposed condominium unit, no reasonable purchaser would believe that the reservation agreement set a binding purchasing price unless the agreement was still in effect when a purchase contract was delivered.</p>\n<p id=\"b1331-10\">Zlotnick argues that despite the plain language in his reservation agreement, Boynton Waterways engaged in a deceptive trade practice under <em>Fendrich v. RBF, L.L.C., </em>842 So.2d 1076 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.2003). In <em>Fendrich, </em>a prospective purchaser entered a reservation agreement to purchase a specific lot, designated as Lot 10A, at a firm purchase price. <em>See Fendrich, </em>842 So.2d at 1078. The <em>Fendrich </em>reservation agreement also contained a termination option, which provided that \u201cPurchaser acknowledges that until both Purchaser and Seller have executed a Contract ..., Purchaser is under no obligation to purchase and Seller is under no obligation to sell such Residence Home(s). This agreement can be terminated by either party at any time, subject to a refund of Purchaser\u2019s Deposit ....\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1331-11\">In <em>Fendrich, </em>the seller did not cancel the reservation agreement. Instead, while <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1286\">*1286</page-number>the reservation agreement in <em>Fendrich </em>was still in effect, the seller allegedly tendered a purchase contract for a less desirable home, designated as Lot 2C, at a higher price. <em>Id. </em>The Florida state appeals court concluded that although the reservation agreement stated that it was not a purchase contract, \u201c[w]hen the reservation form ... unequivocally represents that the consumer will be given the opportunity to purchase a particular lot or unit at a firm price, it can be likely to mislead.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1080.</p>\n<p id=\"b1332-4\">The circumstances here differ materially from the scheme in <em>Fendrich, </em>however. First, Zlotnick\u2019s reservation agreement included additional language emphasizing that it did not establish a binding purchase agreement. Zlotnick\u2019s reservation agreement provided that the deposit only \u201cexpresses Purchaser\u2019s interest in purchasing Unit No. 207N (the \u2018Unit\u2019),\u201d and, significantly, further stated, \u201cthis Reservation Agreement is not an agreement to sell the Unit,, nor does it confer any lien upon or interest in the Unit or on the proposed Condominium property.\u201d The reservation agreement in <em>Fendrich </em>contained no terms similar to this further statement in Zlotnick\u2019s agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1332-5\">Second, even though the reservation agreement in <em>Fendrich </em>also allowed either the developer or the purchaser to terminate the agreement, Zlotnick\u2019s reservation agreement contained the additional clarification that if Boynton Waterways canceled the agreement, \u201cthereafter Purchaser shall have no claim of any kind against Seller.\u201d Accordingly, Zlotnick\u2019s reservation agreement more clearly expressed that it did not establish a binding purchase price and carried no more legal significance than an \u201cagreement to agree,\u201d thus diminishing the likelihood to mislead.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1332-8\">Most importantly, the reservation agreement in <em>Fendrich </em>was still in effect when the developer furnished a purchase contract for a different lot at a higher price, but, in contrast, Boynton Waterways canceled its reservation agreement with Zlot-nick and other prospective purchasers. By allegedly agreeing to reserve one house but then offering a purchase contract for a pricier and less desirable house, the developer in <em>Fendrich </em>contravened the clear terms of a reservation agreement that was still in force and thus engaged in a \u201cclassic bait and switch.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1079 &amp; n. 1. In this case, however, Boynton Waterways released the \u201cbait\u201d by canceling the reservation agreement, thus eliminating both the obligations and liabilities of Boynton Waterways and Zlotnick, as specified in the express terms of the agreement. Unlike the situation in <em>Fendrich, </em>a reasonable purchaser would not likely be misled into believing that the price set in the reservation agreement was binding because Boyn-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1287\">*1287</page-number>ton Waterways exercised its contractual right to cancel the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1333-4\">Boynton Waterways canceled the reservation agreement before offering a purchase contract, as it had the full right to do by the express terms of the agreement. Upon cancellation, the agreement plainly states that Zlotnick had \u201cno claim of any kind against Seller\u201d because the reservation agreement did not \u201cconfer any lien upon or interest in the Unit.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Under these circumstances, no reasonable purchaser would believe that a void reservation agreement established a binding purchase price when it was merely an \u201cagreement to agree.\u201d Accordingly, we conclude that Zlotnick failed to state a claim under the FDUTPA because the cancellation of the reservation agreement eliminated any possibility that a reasonable purchaser would be misled.</p>\n<p id=\"b1333-5\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1333-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of Zlotnick\u2019s complaint for failure to state a claim.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1333-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1330-8\">. We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s dismissal pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6), accepting as true all facts set forth in the plaintiff\u2019s complaint. <em>Thaeter v. Palm Beach County Sheriff\u2019s Office, </em>449 F.3d 1342, 1352 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1330-9\">. There is no dispute that the reservation agreement here satisfied the other requirements of \u00a7 718.502(2)(c), which states that such agreements must also include: (1) a statement that the developer must file condominium documents with the Division of Florida Land Sales, Condominiums and Mobile Homes prior to entering a binding purchasing agreement; (2) a statement of the right of the prospective purchaser to receive all required condominium documents; (3) the name and address of the escrow agent; and (4) a statement that the deposit must be payable to the escrow agent, who must provide a receipt to the prospective purchaser. Fla. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 718.502(2)(c).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1331-8\">. Zlotnick disputes whether Boynton Waterways had any unilateral authority to cancel the reservation agreement. Zlotnick misreads the plain language of the reservation agreement, which expressly grants the seller the option to cancel \"[b]efore both Purchaser and Seller sign and deliver the Contract.\u201d Moreover, Florida law recognizes the right of both prospective purchasers and developers to cancel reservation agreements. <em>See </em>Fla. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 718.502(2)(a) (requiring that reservation agreements notify prospective purchasers of their right to a refund of the reservation deposit \"upon written request to the escrow agent by the prospective purchaser <em>or </em>the developer\u201d (emphasis added)).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1332-6\">. The district court distinguished <em>Fendrich </em>by noting that Zlotnick's \u201cReservation Agreement clearly provides that it is not an agreement to sell a particular unit at a fixed price, and that the purchaser has only expressed an interest in purchasing a proposed unit.\u201d <em>Zlotnick, </em>431 F.Supp.2d at 1295. The reservation agreement in <em>Fendrich </em>contains a fixed price assurance somewhat similar to the fixed price statement in Zlotnick's reservation agreement, which provides, \"Seller assures that the foregoing purchase price will be the purchase price in the contract for the sale and purchase of the Unit ... submitted to Purchaser.\u201d However, Zlotnick's reservation agreement has the additional provision, missing in the reservation agreement in <em>Fendrich, </em>that \"this Reservation Agreement is not an agreement to sell the Unit, nor does it confer any lien upon or interest in the Unit or on the proposed Condominium property.\u201d We conclude that the additional terms contained in Zlotnick\u2019s reservation agreement, including the no-claim provision, and Boynton Waterways' cancellation of the reservation agreement draw even sharper distinctions with the scheme deemed illegal in <em>Fendrich.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1333-9\">. Zlotnick also claims on appeal that Boynton Waterways improperly canceled the agreement because his reservation deposit allegedly was not returned until months after the cancellation. It is unclear if Boynton Waterways bears any fault for this alleged delay because the reservation agreement states that the escrow agent, not Boynton Waterways, is responsible for the return of the deposit. Regardless, this allegation was not included in Zlotnick\u2019s complaint, and we thus do not consider this extraneous allegation when we are examining whether the complaint on its face failed to state a claim. <em>See Brooks v. Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield of Fla., Inc., </em>116 F.3d 1364, 1368 (11th Cir.1997) (noting that in considering a motion to dismiss, courts review only \"the face of the complaint and attachments thereto\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1333-21\">. Because we conclude that Zlotnick failed to state a claim under the FDUTPA against any party, we do not address whether Zlotnick failed to state a claim against Premier in particular and whether Zlotnick properly alleged actual damages.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
