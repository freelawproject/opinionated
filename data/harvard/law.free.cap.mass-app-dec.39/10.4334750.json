The defendant denied the plaintiff\u2019s claim and further alleged that the coverage provided by its policy did not extend to the plaintiff\u2019s particular loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b18-6\">The parties submitted on the agreed statement of facts which follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b18-7\">\u201cOn August 1, 1965, the defendant issued and delivered to the plaintiffis a policy of insurance numbered CH1-114-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b18-8\">' 067554-07 generally entitled \u2018 Crime Policy\u2019. The policy ran from August 1, 1965, until August 1, 1968.

The policy except for coverages B and C, generally covers the Falls Theatre.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b18-10\">\u201cOn August 27, 1965, two juveniles of about 13 years of age entered the Falls <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>Theatre, while it was not open for business, by forcing a rear exit door, as evidenced by physical damage to the exterior of the premises at the place of entry. Once inside, they broke into a candy case and ice-cream freezer, taking some of the contents thereof. The theatre was found littered with candy and ice cream. They also slashed the picture screen which is affixed to the building.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b19-4\">\u201cThe charges incurred by the plaintiffs as a result of the damage are as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b19-5\">\u201c1.

This clause provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ao2\">\u201cCoverage D \u2014 Loss Within Premises To pay for:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b21-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>(1) loss of money and securities occurring within the premises or within any banking premises or similar recognized place of safe deposit caused by the actual destruction, disappearance or wrongful abstraction thereof; (2) loss of other property or damage thereto caused by robbery within the premises, or by safe burglary, or attempt thereat, and damage to a locked cash drawer, cash box or cash register caused by felonious entry into such container within the premises, or attempt thereat, or by felonious abstraction of such container from within the premises, and damage to the premises caused by robbery, by safe burglary or by or following burlarious entry into the premises, or attempt thereat;\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b21-4\">In construing these provisions it would be helpful to keep in mind that the insurer expressly excluded the provisions of Coverage B and Coverage C. These two clauses are thus expressed in the policy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b21-5\">\u201cCoverage B \u2014 Burglary of Merchandise Within Premises To pay for:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b21-6\">(1) loss from within the premises of merchandise, furnishings, fixtures and equipment caused by burglary or by robbery of a watchman; (2) damage to the premises and to merchandise, furnishings, fixtures and equipment within the premises <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>caused by burglary, robbery of a watchman, or attempt thereat.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b22-4\">\u201cCoverage C \u2014 Theft of Merchandise Within Premises To pay for:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b22-5\">(1) loss from within the premises of merchandise, furnishings, fixtures and equipment caused by theft; (2) damage to the premises and to merchandise, furnishings, fixtures and equipment within the premises caused by theft or attempt thereat.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b22-6\">It is very apparent that there would be no question of the defendant\u2019s liability if the \u2022plaintiff had available to it the provisions of Coverage B or Coverage C. It is also important to keep in mind that if'the plaintiff\u2019s loss comes within the scope of Coverage B and C, the agreement has expressly relieved the defendant from liability under it.</p>\n<p id=\"b22-7\">If the finding for the plaintiff is to be sustained it must derive from a distinction in. the circumstances of this case from those provided for in Coverage B and C; and further from the fact that the loss in issue comes clearly within the benefits conferred by Coverage D.</p>\n<p id=\"b22-8\">Let us- examine seriatim the different benefits provided by Coverage D. In subsection (1) the insurer agrees to pay for</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b22-9\">\u201c(1) loss of money and securities oe- \u2022 curring within the premises or within any .. -banking premises or similar . recognized <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>place of safe deposit caused by the actual destruction, disappearance or wrongful abstraction thereof; \u2019 \u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b23-4\">The loss for which the plaintiff makes its claim dlearly does not come within this provision. Nor does the provision in \u201c (2) \u201d which insures against:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b23-5\">\u201closs of other property or damage thereto caused by robbery within the premises,\u201d.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b23-6\">The acts of the malefactors responsible for all the damage did not constitute robbery, and this clause is of no help to the plaintiff. Subsection (2) also applies to loss by</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b23-7\">\u201csafe burglary or attempt thereat, and damage to a locked cash drawer, cash box . or cash register caused by felonious entry into such container within the premises or attempt thereat, or by felonious abstraction of such container from within the premises and damage to the premises caused by robbery, by safe burglary or by or following burglarious entry into the premises or attempt thereat; \u2019 \u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b23-8\">A comparison of the provisions of Coverage B and C with those of D reveals a dearcut distinction in the undertaking of the defendant. In Coverage B and C it insures against any and all damage caused by any felonious invasion of the premises of the plaintiff. On the other hand, Coverage D insures only money and securities taken from the premises after a felon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>ious entry, loss or damage caused during a robbery, or loss caused by damage to locked cash drawer, cash box, cash register, or by carrying such containers away and for the damage consequent upon isuch abstraction of money from the premises of the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-4\">It is very apparent that no inconsistency is involved in the various forms of coverage provided by Coverage B, C, or D. It is also apparent that if Coverage B and C had not been excluded, the plaintiff would \u2018have been amply covered. In excluding the provisions of Coverage B and C the parties agreed to a more limited type of coverage; \u2014 a coverage that limited liability to the consequences of a felonious carrying away of money or valuables with the damage incidental thereto. Had the policy made no mention of Coverage B and C and provided only Coverage D we might well have pondered in construing the clause whether it embraced all the damage claimed by the plaintiff. But the parties have clearly expressed their intention by excluding the very situation in issue here. There are no ambiguities to give us concern. The parties have clearly indicated the scope of their undertaking, and have expressly stipulated the conditions to which it is not applicable. If we are to give effect to the agreement of the parties, we must conclude that the benefits of this policy are not available to the plaintiff under these circumstances.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b25-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>Robert J.
