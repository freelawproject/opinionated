A request for such a report muist be filed within five (5) days of the finding or decision. If a justice is of the opinion that an interlocutory finding made by him ought to be reviewed by the appellate division before any further proceedings in the trial court, he may report the case for that purpose and stay all further proceedings except such as are necessary to preserve the rights of the parties. G-. L. c. 231, \u00a7 108.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">We are unable to find any decisions by the Supreme Judicial Court as to whether there does exist a right to the review of interlocutory decisions by the District Court. There is some authority to the effect that such a right does not exist. This conclusion is reached by reasoning that the specific reference to the voluntary report of an interlocutory ruling would be unnecessary if the broad statement earlier in the section referring to \u201ca person aggrieved by any ruling\u201d included rulings of interlocutory issues. We prefer to attribute the inclusion of this reference in the section to the grant of power it also contains to stay <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>further proceedings. Appellate Review in the District Court of Mass. Leon B. Newman (1937) 17 <em>Boston U. L. Rev. </em>50.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">We are of the opinion that Q-.L. c. 231, \u00a7 108 does grant a right of review of interlocutory decisions of District Courts. The right, however, cannot be exercised until the case is ripe for judgment. <em>Patrick </em>v. <em>Mikolaitis, </em>22 Mass. App. Dec. 167.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">The right is exercised by following the procedure set out in the <em>Rules of the District Courts </em>(Jan. 1, 1965). The rules that implement \u00a7 108 in respect to reporting a ruling to the appellate division are those numbered 27, 28 and 29.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-7\">Rule 28 applies here since Rule 27 refers to requests for rulings and rulings on the admission or exclusion of evidence, and Rule 29 refers to voluntary reports.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-8\">The report in this case is not a voluntary one. <em>Pakrant </em>v. <em>Harrigan, </em>20 Mass. App. Dec. 1.</p>\n<p id=\"AWSu\">Rule 28 requires that a draft report be filed within ten (10) days after notice of the finding or decision provided the case be then ripe for judgment. The rule does provide for an extension of this ten day period by the court for a reasonable time \u201cfor good cause shown upon the filing of a motion therefor within said ten days.\u201d The rule further! provides, \u201cIf no draft report is filed as above required, the cause shall proceed as though no claim for report had been made. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b239-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>The docket entries are significant to the issue as to whether the plaintiff has complied with G-.L. c. 231, &gt;\u00a7 108 and Buie 28 of the District Courts are, as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">9-20-66 Plaintiff\u2019s motion to expunge defendant\u2019s answers to interrogatories filed and marked for hearing Oct. 14,1966.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">9-20-66 Plaintiff\u2019s brief filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-7\">10- 7-66 Hearing (Justice Whitney) taken under advisement.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-8\">10-17-66 Marked for trial October 28,1966. 10-17-66 Plaintiff\u2019s motion allowed as to</p>\n<p id=\"b239-9\"><em># </em>6, 13, and 19. Denied as to</p>\n<p id=\"b239-10\"># 15a, 15b, 16b, 17b, 18 and 20. Seven days to further answer, parties notified.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-11\">10-24-66 Defendant\u2019s further answers to plaintiff\u2019s interrogatories filed. 10-24-66 Plaintiff\u2019s written exception of Court\u2019s denial to expunge answers to 15a, 15b, 16b, 17b, 18 and 20 filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-12\">12- 2-66 Finding for the defendant, parties notified.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-13\">12- 7-66 Plaintiff\u2019s written request for report filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-14\">12-19-66 Draft report filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-15\">It is apparent from the docket entries that the draft report was not filed within the required ten (10) day period. No motion to extend the time for filing was filed and allowed. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>Consequently, it is mandatory that the case proceed as though no claim for report had been made. For this reason, the case is not properly before this division.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b240-7\">Robert F. Sylvia, for the Plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"b240-8\">James F. McLaughlin, of Brighton, for the Defendant.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b240-4\">Further, the failure to comply with Buie 28 by a timely filing of a draft report is not corrected by a statement in the report that the draft report was filed within the time limits if the docket entries clearly indicate that this is not so.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">The trial court has no power to waive mandatory requirements for filing a timely request for a report and draft report. <em>Dias </em>v. <em>Fairhaven Institution for Savings, </em>22 Mass.
