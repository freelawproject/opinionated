No. 188,552</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b115-7\">\n<em>Adlow, C. J.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"Aj5\">Action of contract to recover money paid to the defendant in settlement of a disputed claim. The breach charged against the defendant consists of his bringing -suit against the plaintiff to collect a balance due on an already settled claim. The court sustained the demurrer filed by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"ABq\">There was no error. If an arrangement was made by the parties to settle a <em>disputed </em>\u00a1claim for $750, and the check tendered in settlement had a notation on the back that it was \u201cin full payment and settlement\u201d, the arrangement and its fulfillment suffice to discharge whatever obligation was outstanding between the parties. <em>Tuttle </em>v. <em>Tuttle, </em>12 Met. 551. <em>Donahue </em>v. <em>Woodbury, </em>6 Cush. 148. <em>Alvord </em>v. <em>Marsh, </em>12 Allen 603. <em>Tompkins </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>145 Mass. 379. <em>Whittaker Chain Tread Co. </em>v. <em>Standard Auto Supply Co., </em>216 Mass. 204.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-8\">Such a release serves only to extinguish an existing claim. The effect of the arrangement has been indelicately described as a \u201cdestruction\u201d of the claim. One who has made such a payment has a good and sufficient defense to a claim of such settlement. However, the arrangement provides no contractual basis for a claim against the creditor who, after accepting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>the tendered check, subsequently demands more.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AUtW\">Andrew L. Benson, of Winthrop, for the Plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"b116-8\">Abraham Margolis, of Boston, for the Defendant.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">A release is not a contract. <em>Stiebel </em>v. <em>Grosberg, 202 </em>NY 266. It is at most a defense which if sustained is fatal to the creditor\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">If the allegations in the declaration in issue are true the plaintiff has a good and sufficient defense to the action in which he is a defendant. If he prevails in that action, he has suffered no harm; if he does not prevail, the court\u2019s findings will preclude his right to claim a valid and binding settlement of a disputed claim. <em>Whittaker Chain Tread Co. </em>v. <em>Standard Auto Supply Co., </em>216 Mass. 204.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-7\">There may be circumstances under which one who has paid money in order to compound a claim against him may recover same. Money paid by mistake may be recovered back. <em>Haven </em>v. <em>Foster, </em>9 Pick. 111. <em>Reggio </em>v. <em>Warren, </em>207 Mass. 525. Similarly with respect to money paid under duress, fraud, or misrepresentation. <em>Willett </em>v. <em>Herrick, </em>258 Mass. 585, 595. But there are no allegations in the declaration under review to provide such basis for an action. There was no error. Eeport dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
