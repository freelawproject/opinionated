The plaintiff\u2019s declaration is in two counts, as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b147-9\">Count I is for money had and received by the defendant to the plaintiff\u2019s use.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-10\">Count II is for breach of contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-11\">The answer is a general denial and an allegation of payment on behalf of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-12\">The justice who heard the case found the following facts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-13\">\u201cThe court finds that said Colonial Drug Company of Scituate, Inc. has received the $1,500.00 from the Guaranty Trust Co. and in consideration thereof the Colonial Drug Co. of Scituate, Inc. has assigned its rights against Clerkin to the Guaranty Trust Co.; The Guaranty Trust Co. brings the present suit in the name of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>the Colonial Drug Company of Scituate, Inc.\u201d</blockquote>\n<attorneys id=\"b148-7\">David S.
