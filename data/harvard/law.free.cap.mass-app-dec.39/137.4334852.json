J.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"Ac2\">This tort action was transferred for trial by order of a justice of the Superior Court under the provisions of G.L. c. 231, \u00a7 102C to the District Court. The minor plaintiff, Lisa Langone, alleges she was injured as a result of her eyelid being caught on a dangerous and hazardous metal furnished by the defendant to the operator of a drug store in Chicopee, Massachusetts for the sale and display of its products. Her father sues for consequential damages. The trial justice on <em>July 20, 1967 </em>found for the plaintiffs and on the same day notice of his findings was mailed to counsel for the parties;</p>\n<p id=\"b144-9\">On <em>July 27, 1967 </em>the defendant filed a motion for a new trial which, after hearing, was denied on <em>August 9, 1967. On August 12, 1967 </em>the defendant filed a draft report claiming to be aggrieved by the denial of certain requests for rulings of law duly filed at the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>We agree with the contention of the plaintiffs that the report is not properly here.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">G-.L. c. 231, \u00a7 108 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-6\">\u201cThe request for such a report shall be filed with the clerk of any district court within <em>five days </em>after notice of the finding or decision...\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b145-7\">Buie 27 of the Buies of the District Courts (1965) provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b145-8\">\u201cSuch a request for a report shall be filed with the clerk within <em>five days </em>after notice of the finding or decision\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-9\">Both the statute and the rule further provide that a draft report filed within this period shall be deemed to include a request for a report.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-10\">\u201cProvision of statutes and rules of court regulating appellate procedure are construed strictly.\u201d <em>Famigletti </em>v. <em>Neviackas, </em>324 Mass. 70, 72. The defendant did not file a request for a report. It filed a draft report [concerning matters involved in the judge\u2019s finding] on <em>August 12, 1967, </em>twenty-two days after notice of finding. Failure to file a request for a report or a draft report within five days of notice of finding is fatal to its right to prosecute this appeal. <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>William C.
