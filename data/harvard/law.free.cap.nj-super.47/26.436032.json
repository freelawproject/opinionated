J. A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"Aop\">Plaintiff appeals from a judgment of the Superior Court, Chancery Division, entered on final hearing below, which refused to grant the mandatory injunctive relief she had applied for. She had sought to have the court compel the defendant Jacob Ellis Realties, Inc. (herein called Ellis) to remove portions of a building erected on its premises in violation of a restrictive covenant. Instead the court awarded her, as against Ellis, permanent damages in the sum of $1,000 for the breach of the covenant. She contends on this appeal that the injunction should have issued, but if not, that she should have received a more substantial pecuniary award.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-11\">Plaintiff and Ellis own adjoining parcels of land, the title to which formerly stood in the names of Arthur S. Elagg and wife. In 1925 the Elaggs conveyed Ellis\u2019 parcel to The Pierson Company by deed containing the above-mentioned covenant reading as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-12\">\u201cThe party of the second part [The Pierson Company], for himself and his heirs and assigns, hereby covenants and agrees to and with the said Arthur S. Elagg, his heirs and assigns, that if and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>when a building shall be erected upon the lands above described, the southeasterly side wall thereof, above (sic) planed fifteen feet above the elevation of the northeasterly curb of Elm Street shall not at any point be within four feet of the southeasterly side line of the lands above described [this side line is the boundary line between Ellis\u2019 parcel and plaintiff\u2019s parcel], it being intended that an air space four feet wide, extending upward from a plane fifteen feet above the grade of the present curb, shall always be reserved for the benefit of the lands remaining to Flagg, this conveyance being made upon that condition.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b45-5\">The \"lands remaining to Flagg,\u201d which we may for convenience designate the dominant tenement, were in 1932 conveyed to the plaintiff and her husband who has since died; and the lands deeded to The Pierson Company, the servient tenement, were in 1947 conveyed by the company to Ellis. In 1954 Ellis erected, in violation of the covenant, a store 25.30 feet high, extending right up to plaintiff\u2019s property line, thus blocking off the lower half of two windows on the second floor of the building on plaintiff\u2019s parcel, which windows are practically on the same line. There is no dispute upon the appeal but that this is a valid covenant, enforceable by the plaintiff against Ellis and breached by Ellis in that it failed to leave an air space four feet wide extending upward from a plane fifteen feet above the grade of the curb referred to. The dispute here is simply what should be the remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">The principal question of law raised by this dispute is whether plaintiff is entitled to a mandatory injunction. No plaintiff is entitled to such an injunction as of course, merely because of a violation of a covenant affecting real property, for which, to be sure, there is no adequate remedy at law. The allowance of injunctive relief is a discretionary matter, in that the court may be called upon to give or withhold relief depending upon variables, namely, the circumstances of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-7\">One such circumstance affecting the decision in cases like the present would arise if Ellis\u2019 violation of the covenant had been wanton in character. <em>Scuorzo v. Infantino, </em>104 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>520, 523 <em>(Ch. </em>1929); <em>cf. </em>4 <em>Restatement, Torts </em>710, 711 (1939). But there is no claim of that here. On the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>contrary, at the time of the violation Ellis apparently had no knowledge of the covenant, except that imposed by the records. For even though its president had had actual knowledge of it in 1947 when Ellis acquired title to the property, he testified he had forgotten about the covenant until after the completion of the building, when it was called to his attention by Ellis\u2019 attorney in connection with a mortgage Ellis placed on the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-4\">A second such circumstance is laches. However, we shall assume that the plaintiff is not chargeable therewith. She never learned of the covenant until Ellis\u2019 building was completed, when Ellis\u2019 attorney called it to her attention (presumably in order to secure from her a release of the covenant). Nor does she have constructive notice of the covenant by virtue of the recording act, <em>N. J. S. A. </em>46 :21-1, since the covenant does not appear in her chain of title. <em>Glorieux v. Lighthipe, </em>88 <em>N. J. L. </em>199 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1915); Annotation, 16 <em>A. L. R. </em>1013; 1 <em>Thompson, Real Property, </em>\u00a7 383 (1940); 8 <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 4453; but <em>cf. </em>4 <em>American Law of Property, </em>\u00a7 17.24 (see also \u00a7 17.17) (1954); <em>Higbee Fishing Club v. Atlantic City Electric Co., </em>78 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>434 <em>(Ch. </em>1911); <em>William Dahm Realty Corp. v. Cardel, </em>128 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>222, 227 <em>(Ch. </em>1940); <em>Ingling v. Public Service Elec. &amp; Gas Co., </em>10 <em>N. J. Super. </em>1, 9 <em>(App. Div. </em>1950), referring to the \u201cTelephone Company grant.\u201d However at three points of time she did observe the erection of the building which violated the covenant: when the offending wall was being laid, when it was partially completed, and when it was finished. Indeed, when the wall was partly up, she was told by some man who (in her words) \u201chad something to do with the building,\u201d that the wall was to be 25 feet high, which, as she feared at the time, was of a height sufficient to obstruct partially window areas in the second floor. Notwithstanding this notice, she apparently did nothing at all about the matter until advised of the covenant by Ellis\u2019 attorney, as above stated. We shall, however, assume that her failure to act under the circumstances is not a material factor in the decision here.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>There are some cases in other jurisdictions where the courts, in weighing the relative equities of the parties under somewhat comparable circumstances, have taken into account the failure of one of the parties to act as a reasonable man with relation to the other. <em>Christensen v. Tucker, </em>114 <em>Cal. App. 2d </em>554, 250 <em>P. 2d </em>660, 666 <em>(Cl. App. </em>1952) ; <em>Sisters of St. Joseph Corp. v. Atlas Sand, Gravel &amp; Stone Co., </em>120 <em>Conn. </em>168, 180 <em>A. </em>303, 307 <em>(Sup. Ct. Err. </em>1935); <em>Kershishian v. Johnson, </em>210 Mass. 135, 96 <em>N. E. </em>56, 57, 36 <em>L. R. A., N. S., </em>402 <em>(Sup. Jud. Ct. </em>1911); <em>Raposa v. Guay, R. I., </em>125 <em>A. 2d </em>113, 118 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1956). But the proofs and the findings here, with respect to both Ellis and the plaintiff, do not warrant any consideration by us of the question whether the carelessness of one of them should be a factor in the decision here, and indeed this question was apparently not presented below or on the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">There were, however, other circumstances which induced the Chancery Division to deny a mandatory injunction, but they raise a question whether the doctrine of relative hardships is to be accepted in this State. The point to be resolved is whether the court should deny an injunction in a case where the economic benefit derivable by the plaintiff therefrom is grossly less than the expense which would thereby be put upon the defendant in carrying out the injunction. There is a substantial body of authority in this state holding that the doctrine cannot be invoked by way of defense when an injunction is sought (as it was in this case) on final hearing. (The cases dealing with a denial of a mandatory injunction where there is a violation of a property right, such as an equitable servitude, 5 <em>Powell, Real </em>Property, 145 (1956), and the cases dealing with a tort, such as, for example, a trespass on someone else\u2019s property through an encroachment, have been cited indiscriminately; it is difficult to draw a distinction between them where they all rest on property rights. Nuisance cases also are relevant in certain respects, and they too have been cited.) <em>Dill v. Board of Education of City of Camden, </em>47 <em>N. J.

Rev. </em>243 (1955).</p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">However the <em>Restatement </em>and the decided weight of authority in other jurisdictions do sustain the doctrine. <em>Restatement of Torts, </em>\u00a7 941 (1939); <em>Restatement, Property, </em>\u00a7 563 (1944); 6-A <em>American Law of Property, </em>\u00a7 28.17 (1954); <em>McClintock, Equity, </em>383-393 (1948); <em>Annotation, \u201cMandatory Injunction to Compel Removal of Encroachments by Adjoining Landowner,\u201d </em>28 <em>A.

Cal. L. Rev. </em>139 (1955). In accord see, <em>e. g., City of Harrisonville, Mo. v. W. S. Dikcey Clay Mfg. Co., </em>289 <em>U. S. </em>334, 53 <em>S. Ct. </em>602, 77 <em>L. Ed. </em>1208 (1933) (Brandeis J. for the court); <em>Hill v. Kimball, </em>269 <em>Ill. </em>398, 110 <em>N. E. </em>18, 26 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1915); <em>Bondy v.

E. </em>862, 863 <em>(Ct. App. </em>1917); but <em>cf. Whalen v. Union Bag &amp; Paper Co., </em>208 <em>N. Y. </em>1, 101 <em>N. E. </em>805, 806 <em>(Ct. App. 1913) </em>(plaintiff, the owner of a farm, was damaged, to the extent of $100 a year, by polluted water from defendant\u2019s plant which represented an investment of more than $1,000,000. An injunction was issued; the court said it would not \u201cdeprive the poor litigant of his little property by giving it to those already rich\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b50-4\">The doctrine of relative hardship does not call for the mere balancing of conveniences on final hearing. Thus the fact that the harm to the defendant caused by the injunction will slightly exceed the benefit the plaintiff receives therefrom does not justify a denial of injunctive relief. Por after all, the plaintiff is the owner of an equitable servitude, and the defendant has violated plaintiff\u2019s rights. Hence, a mere disproportion between the harm to the defendant and the benefit to the plaintiff will not warrant a refusal of such relief, where it is the sole reason offered by the defendant for the refusal, unless the disproportion is gross or of considerable magnitude. Plaintiff, it is to be observed, is not then left without any redress; she is given what plaintiffs are given in many types of cases\u2014 relief measured, so far as the court reasonably may do so, in damages. In the granting of such redress, there is no such disproportion between the harm to the defendant and the benefit to the plaintiff. <em>Restatemenl, Property, </em>\u00a7 563 and comments; <em>Restatement, Torts, </em>\u00a7 941 and comments.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>The doctrine is, we think, particularly applicable to-a case, such as this, wherein we are dealing with two commercial properties; personal interests, or the pleasure that may be secured in the enjoyment of an equitable servitude-of a certain type, is in no way involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">In our view, therefore, the doctrine of relative hardship, as above expounded, is supportable as \u201cthe more equitable view.\u201d <em>Rossi v. Sierchio, </em>30 <em>N. J. Super. 575, 583 (App. Div. </em>1954). Is the doctrine applicable here? Judge Price found that currently it would cost Ellis $11,500 to remodel its building so as to bring it into conformity with the covenant. He also found in connection with the claim of Ellis* tenant that such remodeling would apparently lead to a substantial loss of rental, now due at the rate of $931.25 a month for the next seven years. The amount of this loss is in no way specified.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">On the other hand, plaintiff claimed that by reason of the blocking off of the windows she had suffered a loss in the rental value of the second floor of her building amounting to $600 \u201cin perpetuity.\u201d Her building was 46 years old, originally designed as a moving picture theater, and the second floor is unattractive and very much in need of renovation and has been practically unrented for a period of eight years prior to 1954, when Ellis erected tire building. Ellis* expert witness testified that the second floor was \u201cunr entable.\u201d' Judge Price felt that he could not measure plaintiff\u2019s damagesthrough an estimation of the loss in rental value where obviously plaintiff had very great difficulty in renting the premises. He accepted, instead, the proofs submitted on Ellis\u2019 behalf that the permanent damage to plaintiff\u2019s property came to-$1,000. It must be remembered that on the erection of a-, building on Ellis\u2019 parcel, the equitable servitude was so-designed as to leave plaintiff merely with a view of a wall four feet away from her upper story windows.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-7\">This damage to the plaintiff of $1,000 and the damage to Ellis of $11,500, added to whatever would be lost by Ellis in the way of the rental of its building, are so grossly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>disproportionate in amount as to justify the denial of the mandatory injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-4\">Plaintiff\u2019s second point on the appeal is that the award of $1,000 to the plaintiff to compensate her permanently for the violation of the covenant is inadequate. We cannot say that this is so. Disregarding the claim for $600 per annum in perpetuity \u2014 which for reasons already stated should be disregarded \u2014 we \u00f1nd no proofs in the case as to plaintiff\u2019s damages other than those, submitted on Ellis\u2019 behalf, showing, as stated, a loss of $1,000. Plaintiff asks to have the case remanded so that further evidence can be put in on her behalf establishing damages exceeding this sum. But this evidence should have been submitted at the trial, and we see no sufficient basis now for awarding a new trial in order to permit it to be offered.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
