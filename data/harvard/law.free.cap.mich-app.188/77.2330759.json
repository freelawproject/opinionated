On appeal, we affirmed. <em>People v </em>Draper, 150 Mich App 481; 389 NW2d 89 (1986). However, by order of the Supreme Court, in lieu of granting leave to appeal, this case was remanded to the Court of Appeals for reconsideration in light of <em>People v Beckley, </em>434 Mich 691; 456 NW2d 391 (1990), and its companion case of <em>People v Badour. </em>437 Mich 872 (1990). Upon reconsideration, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-7\">In <em>Beckley, </em>a plurality decision, a majority of the Supreme Court agreed that an expert witness may testify that the behavior of the child victim is consistent with that of child sexual abuse victims generally. However, the expert may not testify about whether the victim\u2019s allegations are truthful, or whether sexual abuse in fact occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-8\">In this case, the experts, Rosemary Jalovaara and Linda Butterfield, both psychologists, testified about characteristics normally found in sexually abused children. Under <em>Beckley, </em>that testimony was proper because it assists the trier of fact without rendering an opinion regarding whether abuse had in fact occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-9\">However, both experts went on to conclude that, in their opinion, the victim in this case had been sexually abused. We feel that this is the kind of testimony prohibited under <em>Beckley. </em>These opinions go beyond merely relating whether the victim\u2019s behavior is consistent with that found in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>other child sexual abuse victims. They are opinions on an ultimate issue of fact, which is for the jury\u2019s determination alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">Consequently, defendant\u2019s conviction is reversed, and we remand this case for a new trial. We do not retain jurisdiction.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
