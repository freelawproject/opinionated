On appeal, we affirmed. <em>People v Reinhardt, </em>167 Mich App 584; 423 NW2d 275 (1988). However, by order of our Supreme Court, that judgment has been vacated, and this case has been remanded to this Court for reconsideration in light of <em>People v Beckley, </em>434 Mich 691; 456 NW2d 391 (1990), and its companion case, <em>People v Badour, </em>regarding whether the testimony of expert witnesses at trial impermissibly vouched for the credibility of the child victim. 436 Mich 866 (1990). Pursuant to our own order, the parties were directed to submit supplemental briefs on that issue, and to include support for reconsideration of defendant\u2019s sentence in light of <em>People v Milbourn, </em>435 Mich 630; 461 NW2d 1 (1990). After reconsideration, we once again affirm defendant\u2019s conviction, but reverse his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-3\">In <em>Beckley, </em>a plurality decision, the Supreme Court held that an expert witness may testify that the behavior of the child victim is consistent with that of child sexual abuse victims generally. However, the expert may not testify regarding whether the victim\u2019s allegations are truthful, or whether sexual abuse in fact occurred. The lead opinion, written by Justice Brickley, would further limit the admissibility of such testimony to situations where the behavior of the victim is an issue in the case, i.e., where the credibility of the victim has been or would be attacked by the defendant. <em>Id., </em>pp 722, 729-730. The concurring opinion, written by Justice Boyle, would allow such testimony as substantive evidence whenever the victim\u2019s credi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>bility is an issue, rather than only as rebuttal or rehabilitative evidence. <em>Id., </em>p 736.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">In this case, the victim\u2019s credibility was attacked. The victim\u2019s father testified for the defense that he pressured the victim to make up the allegations against defendant in order to break up defendant\u2019s affair with the victim\u2019s mother. Furthermore, the testimony of the prosecution\u2019s three expert witnesses that the victim\u2019s behavior was \"typical\u201d of that normally found in sexually abused children was entirely appropriate testimony as agreed upon by a majority of the Court in <em>Beckley. </em>Consequently, we find no reason to reverse defendant\u2019s conviction on the basis of this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">With respect to defendant\u2019s sentence, however, we reverse. The minimum sentence imposed by the trial court of thirty-five years was fifteen years beyond the maximum minimum recommended under the guidelines. After reexamination of the record at sentencing, we find it appropriate to remand this matter for resentencing consistent with the principle of proportionality announced in <em>Milbourn.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b94-7\">In summary, defendant\u2019s conviction is affirmed, his sentence is reversed, and we remand for resentencing. We do not retain jurisdiction.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
