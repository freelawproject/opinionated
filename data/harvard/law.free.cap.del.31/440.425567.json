And that under \u201cthe Federal Control Act\u201d (40 Statutes, 451) and the Proclamation of the President, under <em>chapter </em>418, 39 Statutes 645, and Comp. St. 1918, \u00a7 1974A, and \u201cGeneral Order No. 50\u201d of the Director General under Comp. St. 1918, \u00a7 3115%h, the Pullman Company had no control, or authority over the claimant, nor over the terms of his employment, or wages; and, in fact, claimant\u2019s compensation for wages was paid to him under the Federal Control Act, and not from the money of the Pullman Company. <em>Section </em>135, <em>par. </em>3193pp, Delaware Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law of 1917, was cited as showing who are employers subject to the provisions of the act.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b460-9\">It was urged that under the Federal Control Act and the proclamation of the President, the Director General of Railroads was a governmental agency, and that the claimant was injured while in the employ of that agency, and he could not invoke the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act in his favor, and, therefore, the Industrial Accident Board was without jurisdiction, or authority, to make an award in favor of claimant, binding on the Director General of Railroads.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b460-10\">It was conceded that the decisions of the Courts, construing said \u201cGeneral Order No. 50,\u201d were conflicting upon the question whether a claimant must bring his claim against the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>Director General of Railroads, or against the corporation. <em>Mardis v. Hines, Director General of Railroads (C. C. A.) </em>267 <em>Fed. </em>171.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b461-6\">The claim was made:</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b461-7\">That the possession and control of the Pullman Company by the United States was complete and undivided, and that private ownership by the corporation during the period of such possession and control was displaced. <em>North. Pac. R. Co. v. North Dakota, </em>250 <em>U. S. </em>135, 39 <em>Sup: Ct. </em>502, 63 <em>L. Ed. </em>897.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b461-8\">That there is nothing in the Federal Control Act, or in any order made by authority of the President, which authorizes or contemplates a joint action against the Director General and the Pullman Company for personal injuries suffered by an employee of the Director General. <em>Blevins v. Hines, etc. (D. </em>C.) 264 <em>Fed. </em>1005; <em>Nash v. So. Pac. Co. (D. C.) </em>260 Fed. 280. The Pullman Company is not liable to claimant. <em>Hines, etc., v. Dahn </em>(C. <em>C: A.) </em>267 <em>Fed. </em>105; <em>Erie Railway Co. et al. v. Caldwell </em>(C. <em>C. A.) </em>264 <em>Fed. </em>947.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b461-9\">The claimant was, at the time of the accident, engaged in interstate commerce. His testimony was that all the work done in the Pullman plant was done \u201c on cars that go a^l over the United States; that there was never any local work done there.\u201d Whether the claimant was engaged in inter or intra state commerce is directly at issue. <em>Erie Railroad Co. v. Szary, </em>253 <em>U. S. </em>86, 40 Sup. <em>Ct. </em>454, 64 <em>L. Ed. </em>794; <em>D. L. &amp; W. R. Co., v. Busse (C. C. A.) </em>263 <em>Fed. </em>516; <em>Cen. Railroad of N. J. v. Sharkey, </em>259 <em>Fed. </em>144, 170 C. <em>C. A. </em>212; <em>P. B. &amp;. W. R. Co., v. Smith, </em>250 <em>U. S. </em>101, 39 <em>Sup. Ct. </em>396, 63 <em>L. Ed. 869.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b461-10\">No award of the Industrial Accident Board should have been made in this case, because the claimant was engaged in interstate commerce at the time of his injury. <em>Phila. &amp; Read. Ry. Co. v. Hancock, </em>253 <em>U. S. </em>284, 40 <em>Sup. Ct. </em>512, 64 <em>L. Ed. </em>907. His right of action for compensation was under the Federal Employers\u2019 Liability Act. Our own Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law of 1917, <em>section </em>3193ww, specifically excepts a case like this from the provisions of the act.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b461-11\">No award can be made in this case against the Director General of Railroads for the reason that neither he nor the claimant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>come within the provisions of the Delaware Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law of 1917, <em>Sections </em>3193pp, 3193qq. The Director General does not come within any of the enumerated classes of employers which are made subject to the act.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b462-4\">It was urged in reply that the evidence showed that the claimant was at the time of the accident, and for many years before, had been employed at the Pullman plant, in Wilmington, Delaware, owned and operated by the\u00b0 corporation defendant, but which had been taken over by the Director General of Railroads, under acts of Congress (39 Statutes, 645, and 40 Statutes, 451) and that although upon taking over by the Director General-, the Pullman Company became an instrumentality of the federal government, nevertheless by section 10 of the last above cited statute, the capacity of the carrier to sue and be sued remained the same after as before the government\u2019s taking over. <em>Bryant v. Pullman Co., </em>188 <em>App. Div. </em>311, 177 <em>N. Y. Supp. </em>488; <em>Postal Tel. Cab. Co. v. Call, District Judge, </em>255 <em>Fed. </em>850, 167 <em>C. C. A. </em>178; <em>Dantzler Co. v. Texas, etc., Ry. Co., </em>119 <em>Miss. </em>328, 80 <em>South. </em>770, 4 <em>A. L. R. </em>1669; <em>Jensen v. Legh. Val. R. Co. (D. C.) </em>255 <em>Fed. </em>795.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b462-5\">It is true several federal courts have held \u201cGeneral Order No. 50\u201d of the Director General was legal and have allowed his substitution in place of defendant railroad companies. <em>Nash v. S. Pac. Co. (D. C.) </em>260 Fed. 280; <em>Rutherford v. Union Pac. R. Co. (D. C. </em>) 254 <em>Fed. </em>880. None of these courts assumed to declare said <em>section </em>10 unconstitutional; its constitutionality was not questioned.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b462-6\">The better reasoned federal and state decisions hold \u2018\u2018General Order No. 50,\u201d in so far as it is inconsistent with said section 10, void. <em>Lavalle v. North. Pac. Ry. Co., </em>143 <em>Minn. </em>74, 172 <em>N. W. </em>918, 4 <em>A. L. R. </em>1659; <em>Johnson v. McAdoo (D. C.) </em>257 <em>Fed. </em>757; <em>Moore v. Atch., etc., Ry. Co., </em>106 <em>Misc. Rep. </em>58, 174 <em>N. Y. Supp. </em>60, 63.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b462-7\">The evidence showed that the claimant at the time of the accident was injured while in the performance of his duties in directing the movement of a car containing coal from one point to another point in the yards of the Pullman plant; that this car was used only for hauling coal and freight between different points <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>within the yard and was not used outside. The car was carrying fuel for heating the plant boilers. What constitutes work in interstate traffic? <em>C., B. &amp; Q. R. R. v. Harrington, </em>241 <em>U. S. </em>177, 36 <em>Sup. Ct. </em>517, 60 <em>L. Ed. </em>941. The principle of this case covers the case at bar. <em>Lehigh Val. R. R. Co. v. Barlow, </em>244 <em>U. S. </em>183, 37 <em>Sup. Ct. </em>515, 61 <em>L. Ed. </em>1070.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b463-5\">The Delaware Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law justifies concurrent compensation for temporary total and permanent disabilities. On this point, the construction of the act by the Industrial Accident Board is so clearly and well presented, it is unnecessary to suggest anything further.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b463-6\">The claimant\u2019s presence before the Board, the testimony of himself and the members of his family, and of the two physicians who attended and examined him, fully warranted the finding of total disability.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b463-7\">The Board, in making the award against the Pullman Company, very properly exercised care to prevent the act of limitation operating against the claimant, and in reversing the right to subsequently make an award against the Director General of Railroads in case its award against the Pullman Company should be held as wrongful.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b463-8\">The court should refuse to reverse the award of the Industrial Accident Board, upon highly technical grounds and of a kind upon which the United States Supreme Court may ultimately adopt either way.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b463-9\">The cases cited for appellee, in support of his contention, are, at least, as authoritative as those cited for appellants, on the question whether carriers remained suable during the period of</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b463-10\">federal control. It would seem that the courts adopting appellant\u2019s view paid too little attention to the express language of said section 10, and likewise to the proposition that where an officer derives his authority to act from a statute, that his act must not be in conflict with the statute authorizing it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b463-11\">It is earnestly submitted that appellants suggest no grounds for reversal save on the question of the party against whom the award should have been made.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b464-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>The position of the appellants is, in effect, that the claimant should be held incapable of recovering from anybody for his injuries sustained, though no statute even assumes to take away his rights. The award should therefore be affirmed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b464-6\">After arguments of counsel, the court, on February 11, 1921, handed down the following:</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b464-7\">Per Curiam.</author>\n<p id=\"A5x\">We have carefully considered the evidence in this case and the law applicable thereto, together with the. very full briefs of counsel for both parties. The questions raised here on appeal were raised also before the Industrial Accident Board, which has set out fully, clearly and at length their finding of fact and law and the reasons for so finding. We agree fully with these findings and the award based thereon for the reasons stated by the Board; and, therefore, sustain and affirm them. The costs of appeal are taxed against appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-8\">At the March term, 1921, the following stipulation was filed in the case:</p>\n<p id=\"b464-9\">And now, to wit, this sixth day of April, A. D. 1921, it is hereby stipulated and agreed, by and between John W. Huxley, Jr., attorney for the above-named Pullman Car Lines, United States Administration, and for the Pullman Company, a corporation of Illinois, and Charles F. Curley, attorney for the above-named Patrick Riley, appellee, that the decision made by the superior court on the above-entitled appeal, on February 11, 1921, be modified, so that the award in the above-entitled case may be against James G. Davis, Director General of Railroads, Agent, under Transportation Act, 1920 (41 <em>Stat. </em>456); and that the superior court in and for New Castle county be asked to modify the said judgment to that end.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-10\">(Signed by the attorneys of the parties.)</p>\n<p id=\"b464-11\">Whereupon the following order was made:</p>\n<p id=\"b464-12\">And now, to wit, this sixth day of April, A. D. 1921, the foregoing stipulation having been filed in the said case, it is hereby <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>ordered that the judgment handed down on February 11, 1921, in the said case be modified so that the award in the said case shall be against James G. Davis, Director General of Railroads, Agent, under Transportation Act 1920.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">[Signed] Henry C. Conrad, Judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-7\">The same was certified to the Industrial Accident Board, and, thereupon, the following application of the attorneys in the case was made to the Board:</p>\n<p id=\"b465-8\">This tenth day of March, 1921, it is hereby stipulated between John W. Huxley, Esq., attorney for the Director General of Railroads, Pullman Car Lines, and also attorney for the Pullman Company, a corporation of the state of Illinois, and Charles F. Curley, Esq., attorney for Patrick Riley, claimant in the above proceeding, that the Industrial Accident Board be requested to commute the award formerly made in the above case to a cash sum; and further that the Industrial Accident Board be requested to make an award for the cash amount of the commuted award against John Barton Payne, Agent, under <em>section </em>206 of Transportation Act, for the Pullman Car Lines, U. S. Railroad Administration, instead of against the Pt\u00edllman Company, against whom the award has heretofore been made. The above change in the party awarded against, and the new award above requested not to become effective until the said Director General of Railroads, or some one acting for him, is ready and prepared to pay the amount of the said award.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-9\">(Signed by the attorneys.)</p>\n<p id=\"b465-10\">The Board made the following order:</p>\n<p id=\"b465-11\">Pursuant to an order of the Superior Court New Castle county, April 6, A. D. 1921, the said award made by the Industrial Accident Board of the state of Delaware, April 6,1920, running against the Pullman Company, a corporation of the state of Illinois, and in favor of Patrick Riley, is hereby modified to run against James G. Davis, Director General of Railroads, Agent, under Transportation Act, 1920. In all other respects the said award shall remain as originally made.</p>\n<p id=\"A7H\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>Upon application of Charles F. Curley, Esq., and John W. Huxley, Esq!, counsel for the parties to this case, the Industrial Accident Board authorizes and directs that the compensation due under said award up to March 12, A. D. 1921, shall be paid in a lump sum of eleven hundred and fifty dollars ($1,150.00), and that the balance due under said award shall be commuted at its value on March 12, A. D. 1921, when discounted at five per cent, interest, with annual rests, which value is hereby determined as twenty-three hundred and forty-eight dollars and nineteen cents ($2,348.19).</p>\n<p id=\"b466-4\">This commutation is authorized by the Industrial Accident Board in order to insure full payment of the amount of compensation due under said award out of the fund created for such purpose now under control of James G. Davis, Director General of Railroads, Agent, under Transportation Act, 1920.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">Upon payment of such amount, the employer shall be discharged from all further liability on account of the injury sustained by Patrick Riley on December 13, A. D. 1918.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
