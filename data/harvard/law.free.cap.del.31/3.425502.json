In substance, the allegation in the second count is an averment of an option on the part of the defendants allowing the plaintiff a specified number of days in which to purchase merchandise from the defendants, and the exercise of said option to purchase said property by the plaintiff within that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b20-6\">We think it is not necessary upon demurrer as the pleadings now stand to determine whether there was a good and sufficient consideration to support the option, because the option was at least an offer on the part of the defendant to sell the plaintiff merchandise within a specified time and an acceptance of the offer by the plaintiff within the time specified.</p>\n<p id=\"b20-7\">For the reasons stated, the demurrer to the second count is overruled.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
