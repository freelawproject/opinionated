Jurisdiction here on the ground of desertion may be obtained in two ways where the desertion took place without this State. It may be obtained under <em>Section </em>3014 <em>{supra), </em>in which case, there being no allegation of desertion in this State, the proviso of the Section becomes effective, and it is necessary to prove that desertion is a cause of action in the jurisdiction in which the plaintiff resided at the time the desertion took place.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-10\">Second: Jurisdiction may be acquired under <em>Section </em>3006 <em>(supra) </em>by the application of the legal principle of the continuity of the desertion. In this case it is not necessary to allege or prove desertion to be a cause of action in the jurisdiction in which the plaintiff lived at the time the desertion took place, but it is necessary, in order to give jurisdiction to the Courts of this State, to so draw the petition as to clearly and affirmatively show that a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>continuing act of wilful desertion took place within this State and has continued herein for at least two years next preceding the commencement of the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">If the allegation of the petition does not sufficiently allege a desertion within this State, the only offense which is continued by the application of the principle of continuity, is the offense occurring, in the-foreign jurisdiction which makes the case here cognizable solely under <em>Sec. </em>3014 and subject to the proviso contained therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-7\">In this case the petition alleges as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b584-8\">\u201cYour petitioner therefore avers and charges that during all of the said time in which your petitioner has been continuously a resident of the said City of Wilmington, New Castle County and State of Delaware, as aforesaid, the said defendant has been and still is guilty of wilful desertion of your petitioner, her said husband, to wit, continuously since said fourteenth day of July, A. D. 1919 and up to the present time; and your petitioner further avers and charges that the said defendant was and still is guilty of wilful desertion of your petitioner, her said husband, continuously since the said month of April A. D. 1916 and up until the commencement of this action; and your petitioner further avers and charges that the said defendant was and still is guilty of wilful desertion of your petitioner continuously for more than the two years immediately prior to the commencement of this action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b584-9\">This seems to be entirely sufficient to give this Court jurisdiction.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
