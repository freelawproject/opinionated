The language of the statute is as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b30-8\">\u201cAny parent who shall, without lawful excuse, desert or willfully neglect, or refuse to provide for the support and maintenance of his or her legitimate child or children, under the age of sixteen years, in destitute or necessitous circumstances, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b30-9\">And further:</p>\n<p id=\"b30-10\">\"It is made the duty of the parent of any illegitimate child or children, under the age of sixteen years, to provide for the support and maintenance of such illegitimate child or children.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b31-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>The information charges that the defendant is the father of the child; that the prosecuting witness is his mother; that the child was born on February 3, 1910, out of wedlock and is now in necessitous circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-6\">In this case, as in every criminal case, the defendant is presumed to be innocent, and it is incumbent upon the state to prove to your satisfaction, beyond a reasonable doubt, the necessary elements of the offense charged, that is, the state must thus prove that this child is under sixteen years of age, that he is in necessitous circumstances, and that the defendant is his father.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-7\">It is not disputed that the prosecuting witness is the mother of the child; that the child is under sixteen years of age and that he is in necessitous circumstances. The defendant however, denies that he is the father of the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-8\">In determining that question, you are to take the evidence as you have heard it from the stand, weigh it and consider it. Where it is conflicting you should reconcile it if you can. If you cannot reconcile it, you should believe that which you think most worthy of belief, and reject that which you think less worthy of belief, and if, after such a consideration of the evidence, you are satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused is the father of this child, your verdict should be guilty. If you are not so satisfied your verdict should be not guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-9\">You have nothing to do with what the effect of your verdict may be. That is entirely for the court. You are to determine whether or not the accused is the father of this child, from the evidence as you have heard it, and having done that you should return a verdict accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-10\">Verdict guilty.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
