Bryant, </em>120 <em>Ga. </em>890, 48 S. <em>E. </em>352; <em>Barnard v. Lee, </em>97 <em>Mass. </em>92, 94; <em>Decamp v. Feay, </em>5 <em>Serg. &amp; R. (Pa.) </em>323, 9 <em>Am. Dec. </em>372. That in this case the seller could not rescind the contract, except in case of gross loches in respect to the time of performance; for the contract is not one in which time is of the essence, and one in which there were no gross loches, and therefore, the agreement did not end by mere passage of time.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b257-5\">The seller cannot rescind for waxit of performance by buyer before tendering a deed to buyer and demand performance, and then only in case of gross loches. <em>Kessler v. Pruitt et al., </em>14 <em>Idaho, </em>175, 93 <em>Pac. </em>965; <em>Cranwell v. Clinton Co., 67 N. J. Eq. </em>540, 58 <em>Atl. </em>1030; <em>Leaird v. Smith, </em>44 <em>N.

Cross, 62 N. J. Eq. </em>545, 51 <em>Atl. </em>16; <em>Boone v. Templeman, </em>158 <em>Cal. </em>290, 110 <em>Pac. </em>947, 139 <em>Am. St. Rep. </em>126; <em>Peck v. Brighton Co. </em>69 <em>Ill. </em>200.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b257-7\">The words \u2018 \u2018 balance of seven hundred dollars to be paid upon delivery of the deed\u201d cannot be construed to mean that payment was a condition precedent to delivery of deed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b257-8\">The vendor, in order to rescind, must restore or tender to purchaser what he has received thereunder as a condition precedent to his right to rescind. <em>Anderson v. Haskett et al., </em>45 <em>Iowa, </em>45; <em>Evans v. Bentley, </em>9 <em>Tex. Civ. App. </em>112, 29 S. <em>W. </em>497, 36 S. <em>W. </em>1070; <em>Kelley v. Owens, </em>120 <em>Cal. </em>502, 47 <em>Pac. </em>369, 52 <em>Pac. </em>797; <em>Lytle v. Scottish Amer. Mortg.

Wilson, </em>66 <em>Mich. </em>232, 33 <em>N. W. </em>716.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b258-6\">This rule applies, irrespective of the grounds for rescission.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b258-7\">In the case of <em>Coyle v. Kierski et al., </em>10 <em>Del. Ch. </em>229, 89 <em>Ail. </em>598, time was fixed in the contract for performance by buyer, but not so in this case; the balance of payment, etc., were to be made and performed upon the delivery of the deed. No deed was delivered, and the decision made in the Coyle Case is inapplicable to this case. Such notice as the letter set up in the eleventh plea pretends to be, is not sufficient to rescind the contract; for in it there is no tender back of part payment made. Taking the contract at its worst construction, it is one in which payment arid the giving of a deed are concurrent, and in such a situation tender of deed is a condition precedent to rescission.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b258-8\">Our contention is that the contract sued on is not one in which time is of the essence, and it cannot be rescinded in the absence of gross loches.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b258-9\">For the defendant it was insisted that the contract sued on is what is known in law as an option contract, and it is not a contract of sale. <em>James on Opt. Contr. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 101, 102.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b258-10\">Unless the contract contains language which may reasonably be construed as an agreement on the part of the vendee to purchase the property, or to assume some obligation thereunder, it will be held to be an, option contract and not an agreement of sale and purchase. A contract of sale creates mutual obligations on the part of the seller to sell and on the part of the purchaser to buy while an option gives the right to purchase, within a limited time, without imposing any obligation to purchase. <em>James on Opt. Contr. </em>\u00a7 105.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b258-11\">The mere fact that the initial payment is to be applied upon the purchase price does not change the character of a contract, otherwise a mere option. <em>Land. Co. v. Vaughan, </em>33 <em>Cal. App. </em>130, 164 <em>Pac. </em>610. The fact that a memorandum of agreement stipulates no specific time for performance is a circumstance strongly indicative that it is not an executory contract of sale, conveying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>an equitable title. <em>Stone v. Snell, </em>77 <em>Neb. </em>441, 109 <em>N. W. </em>750; note <em>3 A. L. R. </em>576.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b259-4\">The contract sued on is only signed by the defendant, and not by the plaintiff. There is nothing in the instrument which binds the plaintiff to take the properties, or make payment for them. There is no time set when the terms were to be carried into effect. The plaintiff merely paid $50 and obtained thereby the \u2022 right to purchase the properties upon the terms and in the manner mentioned. <em>Coyle v. Kierski, </em>10 <em>Del. Ch. </em>229, 89 <em>Atl. </em>598.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b259-5\">Boyce, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"ATRP\">delivering the opinion of the court:</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">The writing upon which this action is based was not signed by the plaintiff, and it in no way possesses any of the elements of a binding agreement upon him. There is nothing in the written instrument, according to its terms, which makes it obligatory upon the plaintiff, unless and until, at a future time, he elects to accept and perform. The writing fairly construed shows that it was to become a binding agreement for the sale and purchase of real estate only upon acceptance by the plaintiff. The transaction between the parties was not a sale, or a contract of sale. It was simply a continuing offer of sale. The defendant did not by signing and delivering the writing sell its properties. Neither did the plaintiff, by reason of anything contained therein, purchase the properties. He was only, at most, invested with a right to purchase them upon specified terms, within a reasonable time in the future, no time being fixed during which the right should be exercised. Whatever binding force there was 'in the writing, signed by the defendant, it was only on one side\u2014 unilateral, not bilateral. The defendant was at most, only bound to sell upon compliance with the terms within a reasonable time, and before the offer was withdrawn, if not seasonably accepted. But the plaintiff was not bound to buy, and not until his acceptance and tender of compliance with the terms of the offer could a complete binding contract arise, entirely mutual between the parties, and enforceable either at law for the recovery of damages, or in equity for specific performance.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-9\">No time of performance was stipulated in the writing, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>and the case presented is not one where time is of the essence of any undertaking, except in so far as the subsequent notice to the plaintiff for compliance made time of the essence. Independent of this notice, calling on the plaintiff for compliance, the fact that no time was specified in the original writing for compliance, made it incumbent upon the plaintiff to accept within a reasonable time from the execution and delivery of the writing.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">The weight of authority in this country seems to be to the effect that the deed must be prepared by the vendor in the absence of a stipulation to the contrary. 29 <em>Am. and Eng. Ency. of Law, </em>698. If, however, there was unreasonable delay in complying with the terms of the offer, revocation of the offer could be made without tender of deed and demand of performance by the vendor. If there was unreasonable delay in acceptance and tender of performance, the return of the money paid on account of tfie purchase price was not a condition precedent to the right of the vendor to withdraw his offer of sale. If the subsequent written notice, calling upon the plaintiff for compliance, was reasonable in fixing time for compliance, neither tender of deed, nor of the money received in part payment of the purchase price, was necessary before revocation of the offer of sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-7\"><em>Coyle v. Kierski et al., </em>10 <em>Del. Ch. </em>229, 89 <em>Atl. </em>598, referred to by counsel in their arguments, was a suit by the alleged purchaser for specific performance. The writing which was the basis of the suit was very similar to the writing in this case and was signed by the owners only. Time for performance was specified, but not complied with. There was a subsequent notice to the purchaser. Specific performance was not decreed. The conclusions reached in this case are, in the opinion of this court, in harmony with the decision of the Chancellor on the main questions in the case before him.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-8\">Under the facts of this case, in so far as they are disclosed by the pleadings, the court, after a careful consideration of the arguments, is constrained to hold the several amended pleas (except the third and tenth) good, and to overrule the demurrer as to each of them. The demurrer as to the third and tenth pleas is sustained.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
