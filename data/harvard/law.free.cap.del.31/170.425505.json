Co. v. Saulsbury, </em>115 <em>Tenn. </em>402, 90 S. <em>W. </em>624, 5 <em>Ann. Cas. </em>744. The plaintiffs conceded that it is competent for a railroad company to let its buildings to persons who are to occupy the same at a point adjacent to its railroad, under an agreement that the railroad company shall not be liable for damage to the same by fire from its locomotive engines although owing to the negligence of the railroad company or its employees. 33 <em>Cyc. </em>1330; <em>Griswold v. III. Central R. R. Co., </em>90 <em>Iowa, </em>265, 57 <em>N. W. </em>843 , 24 <em>L.R. A. </em>647. Yet it was urged that in seeking to relieve itself from liability for acts of its own negligence, the railroad company must exercise its right to obtain such an exemption by language which clearly expresses the fact that at the time the parties entered into the contract such was the understanding in the minds of both of them. <em>Hartford Fire Ins. Co. v. Chic., Mil. &amp; St. Paul R. Co., </em>175 U. S. 91, 20 <em>Sup. Ct. </em>33, 44 <em>L. Ed. </em>84. It was claimed that the right of exemption secured by the provision relied on in the plea was limited to some such damages as might result to the plaintiffs, or others, in the use of the buildings and structures from possible defects therein, or from some duty to maintain the same in repair, or from some acts on the part of the plaintiffs, or others than the defendant, arising in any manner, or under any circumstances through the exercise of any right granted or conferred by the agreement between the parties.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b186-8\">Per Curiam.</author>\n<p id=\"AFE\"> The substantial question raised by the pleadings is whether the defendant company entered into an agree<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>ment with the plaintiffs by which the company should be exempt from any liability for damage to the buildings and property which it let to the plaintiffs, although the damage should be occasioned by the negligence of the company, or its employees. An exemption from liability for damages in consequence of negligence as part of the consideration for such an agreement is valid in a case like this. The language of the provision set out in the plea, exempting the defendant company from claims for damages is obviously ambiguous. Clearly exemption from liability for negligence or from fire is not expressed in the provision. If it was the intention of the parties that the provision should secure to the defendant company the exemption claimed for it in this action, it should appear from the language of the provision fairly interpreted; for such immunity cannot rest upon a presumption or strained construction of the provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">It is the opinion of the court that the language of the provision is not sufficiently specific to relieve the defendant company from liability for damages to the said buildings and personal property therein of the plaintiffs, if occasioned by the defendant company in the manner as alleged in the declaration of the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-7\">The demurrer is sustained.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
