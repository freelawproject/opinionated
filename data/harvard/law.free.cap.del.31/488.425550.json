The court will order that the plaintiff pay to his wife, or her attorney, the sum of $75 to cover the necessary expenses of this proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-9\">The following order was thereafter entered:</p>\n<p id=\"b505-10\">\u201cAnd now, to wit, this 10th day of April, A. D. 1921, the petition of Orsolo Contino, the defendant, together with the testimony taken in support of same, having been duly heard and considered, and it appearing to the court that sufficient cause has been shown why a final and absolute decree should be refused and the decree <em>nisi </em>signed in the above stated case should be set aside and annulled.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b505-11\">It is ordered that a final and absolute decree in the above-stated case be refused, and that the decree <em>nisi, </em>signed on the 9th day of December, A. D. 1920, be and the same is hereby annulled and set aside.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-12\">Further ordered that the plaintiff, Giovanni Contino, pay the costs of these proceedings for review, amounting to $28.50, within 60 days.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
