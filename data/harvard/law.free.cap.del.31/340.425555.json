Code </em>1915, which provides that whoever shall take and operate the motor vehicle of another without the consent .of the owner thereof, or the person having the same in charge, shall be- guilty of a misdemeanor.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-16\"> The sole question for your determination is whether or not, Albert Harris did, as charged in the indictment, take and operate, on or about the time laid in the indictment, a certain motor vehicle, the property of Irma Gibbs, the same being in the possession of Benjamin Gibbs, without the consent of the owner, or of her father, Benjamin Gibbs. If you find he did, he violated the statute, regardless of the purpose he had in using the automobile. The fact that the accused had been permitted, or allowed, at times, to drive the automobile to the railroad station to meet <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>some member of the family, did not give the consent of the owner, or person in charge of the car, to drive it at other times to other places. Consent within the meaning of the statute implies authority to drive another\u2019s car. It requires the saction on the part of the owner, or person in charge of the car, to another to drive it.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">Verdict guilty.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
