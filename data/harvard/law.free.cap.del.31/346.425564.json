National Biscuit Co., </em>69 <em>N. J.Law, </em>198, 54 <em>Atl. </em>241, holds that the statute is merely declaratory of the common law and that all of the limitations which surround the common-law right are applicable to the statutory right. So far as I <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>have been able to find, this case is alone and is contrary to all other cases decided in the courts under similar statutes.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b365-4\">The case of <em>Bay State Gas Co. v. State, </em>4 <em>Pennewill, </em>238, 56 <em>Atl. </em>1114, unquestionably lays down a different rule from that laid down by the New Jersey Court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b365-5\"><em>Wight v. Heublein, </em>111 <em>Md. </em>649, 75 <em>Atl. </em>507, is a case in which the writ was denied. This case is the only Maryland case where the writ is denied, and the facts alleged in the return in that case show a most antagonistic purpose on the part of the petitioner, as well as actual harm to the corporation.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b365-6\">For a similar reason the writ was denied in <em>Eaton v. Manter, </em>114 <em>Me. </em>259, 95 <em>Atl. </em>948, and possibly one other Maine case. But there are numerous cases in Maine where the writ has been granted under a set of facts showing a much more objectionable purpose than set up in the return in this case.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b365-7\">There are three cases in New York where the writ J\\.as been refused under the statutory right, <em>Hunter v. National Park Bank, </em>122 <em>App. Div. </em>635, 107 <em>N. Y. Supp. </em>369, <em>People v. Giroux Consolidated Mines Co., </em>122 <em>App. Div. </em>617,107 <em>N. Y. Supp. </em>188, and <em>People v. American Press Association, </em>148 <em>App. Div. </em>651, 133 <em>N. Y. Supp. </em>216. In New York as in Maine there are many cases including the one case decided by the highest court of New York, hereinbefore cited, where the writ has been granted under the same or more objectionable circumstances.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b365-8\">It may be said that where the right of inspection is demanded under a statutory right, the petitioner is not required to state his purpose in the petition, and therefore, has a greater right than he had at common law, even though his purpose may be stated by the corporation in a return which is binding upon the petitioner. This would show a difference in the form of pleading, but no greater right of the petitioner. It is inconceivable to me that the Legislature would have gone to the trouble to have passed a law carefully as 'they did, covering only the stock ledger, an unimportant book, requiring that the inspection be made during business hours and designating the place for the inspection, solely for the purpose of changing the pleading in mandamus proceedings.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b366-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>It is not necessary in this case, it seems to me, to consider whether the inspection of the stock ledger of a corporation is for an unlawful purpose, because it is inconceivable to me that such a purpose could be unlawful.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b366-6\">I have cited authorities which hold that the purpose is absolutely immaterial,' where there is such a statute as here. The impropriety of the purpose urged in this case is confused with a limitation of the common-law right to the effect that any purpose is improper which is not intended to assist the corporation or one of its stockholders with respect to his interest in the corporation. The purpose is not, in this case, improper, it is not fraudulent, it is not illegal, it is not criminal, it ip no part of an illegal or criminal scheme, it is not sinister or for the sake of idle curiosity. The purpose in this case, I submit, cannot be considered such as is shocking to a court for any reason, and no one can fairly say that if the Legislature gave the stockholder the right to this inspection under certain conditions, and the petitioner has complied 'with these conditions, that the court, in granting the natural and proper remedy of mandamus, has done more than its duty regardless of whether anybody may think that the statute was wisely or unwisely passed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b366-7\">That part of the,return as follows:</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b366-8\">II That the motive and purpose of the said William Theile in applying to examine and copy the stock ledger of this corporation is, therefore, illegitimate, sinsiter, unreasonable, without a laudable purpose, or object to accomplish, and so highly improper as to constitute a clear abuse of the right intended to be covered by the statute rather than a clear exercise thereof; and if his application is granted, it will be detrimental to the interest of this corporation, and to the interest of the individual stockholders thereof\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b366-9\">\u2014is not supported by facts properly alleged in the return. I assume that the court will not consider any conclusion which may not properly be drawn from the facts set forth. In considering this very question our court in the case of <em>McCoy et al. v. State et </em>al., 2 <em>Mav. </em>543, 563, 36 <em>Atl. </em>81, 83, states as follows;</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b366-10\">\u201c The return to the alternative writ must set forth either a positive denial of the truth of the allegation therein contained, or state other facts sufficient in law to defeat the relator\u2019s right. And in general the return should contain positive allegations of facts, and not state mere inferences from facts. An <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>argumentative return, like any other argumentative pleading, is bad. And a return, as well as the alternative writ, is faulty which states mere conclusions of law, without stating the facts so that the court may judge of their sufficiency.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b367-6\">This proposition of law can hardly be questioned, and I feel it unnecessary to cite any further authority.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b367-7\">The further proposition, that the right to inspect the stock ledger of a corporation given by statute carried with it as incident thereto the right to make a copy thereof, appears in most all of the authorities hereinbefore cited, and I assume needs no further consideration.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b367-8\">We respectfully submit that the return to the alternative writ of mandamus should be quashed and the peremptory writ of mandamus should be issued.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b367-9\">Argument of Counsel For Defendant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b367-10\">The return shows that the plaintiff invokes the aid of the statute for a purpose that certainly was not contemplated by its framers. The allegations of fact in the return could scarcely be more definite and specific.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b367-11\">Statutes authorizing the inspection of corporate books, similar to the statute of our state;, are merely declaratory of the common law. <em>Guthrie v. Harkness, </em>199 <em>U. S. </em>148, 26 <em>Sup. Ct. </em>4, 50 <em>L. Ed. </em>130, 4 <em>Ann. Cas. </em>433; <em>O\u2019Hara v. National Biscuit Co., </em>69 <em>N. J. Law, </em>198, 54 <em>Atl. </em>241.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b367-12\">It is significant that our statute is almost identical with the New Jersey statute, considered in the latter case. See <em>Powelson v. Tenn. East. Electric Co., </em>220 <em>Mass. </em>380; 107 <em>N. E. </em>997, <em>Ann. Cas. </em>1917A, 102, citing <em>Richardson v.

St. Rep. </em>664, 1 <em>Ann.

The statute has in no way affected the common-law principles governing the issuance of the writ. <em>Eaton v. Manter, </em>114 <em>Me. </em>259, 95 <em>Atl. </em>948; <em>State v. Doe Run Lead Co.

That many of them are cited in the brief for the defendant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b370-4\">2.

That the statute in question is merely declaratory of the common law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"80\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b373-7\">2 That even if these statutes be held to be more than merely declaratory of the common law, certain implied defenses are read into them that may be set up in a return to defeat the petitioner\u2019s prima facie absolute right.</p>\n<p data-order=\"81\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b373-8\">3. That as the statute provided no remedy for the right given to the stockhoder, it can only be enforced by a writ of mandamus, which writ still maintains all of its common-law discretionary character, and will only be issued in a proper case.</p>\n<p data-order=\"82\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b373-9\">4. That at common law the right .to inspect the books of a corporation was merely a qualified right, depending upon the facts shown by the petitioner.</p>\n<p data-order=\"83\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b373-10\">The conclusion which we contend for does not, in effect, repeal our statute, nor does it in any way affect the stockholder\u2019s prima facie right, but this case falls within the well settled exception to the usual rule.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"84\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b373-11\">Rice, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"ACP\">delivering the opinion of the court:</p>\n<p id=\"b373-12\">The argument in this case is upon a motion to quash the return to the alternative writ in a mandamus proceeding brought to compel a corporation, existing under the laws of the state of Delaware, to permit the petitioning stockholder to examine the stock ledger of the corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-13\">The petition filed by the stockholder sets forth that the defendant is a corporation existing under the laws of the state of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>Delaware; that the petitioner is the owner of one share of stock, registered in his name on the books of the company; that during regular business hours on December fourth and fifth he went, to the office of the company in this state and requested and demanded an opportunity to examine the original or duplicate stock ledger of the company, containing the names and addresses of the stockholders and the number of shares held by them, respectively, and was denied the opportunity to inspect such ledger.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">The rule to show cause why the alternative writ should not issue was made absolute and the alternative writ issued. To the alternative writ the defendant filed a return and amendment thereof which in substance alleges: That the corporation has outstanding 422,447 shares of common stock, each of the par value of $100, and 765,871 shares of preferred stock, each of the par value of $100; that the petitioner became the owner of said share on the twentieth day of November, 1919; that there are approximately 26,000 shareholders in the company; that the plaintiff is engaged in the business of procuring and selling for his own individual gain and profit, lists of the names and addresses of stockholders of various corporations; that he is not a broker and is not engaged in the business of buying or selling stocks of this or any other corporation; that he desires the names and address of the stockholders, not for the purpose of acquiring any information as to any matter or thing relating or pertaining to his interest as a stockholder but for the sole purpose and with the sole intention of selling, for his own profit, copies of the names and addresses of the stockholder of the corporation, to other persons, to be used by them in circularizing the public in an effort to sell stocks of other corporations, and if his application is granted, it will be deterimental to the interests of this corporation, and the interests of the individual stockholders thereof, also that he desires to obtain the list and addresses of the stockholders in his corporation to sell to tax collectors in other states.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-7\">The plaintiff claims that he is entitled to examine the stock ledger under the provisions of <em>section </em>1943, <em>Rev. Code </em>1915, being <em>section </em>29 of the General Corporation Law, and to allow the an<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>swer to prevail would be a denial of the rights conferred upon a stockholder in a corporation by the Legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-4\">The defendant contends that notwithstanding the provisions of <em>section </em>29, the remedy to enforce the right still remains in the discretion of the court, if by way of defense the fact is established that the purpose of the petitioner is illegal, sinister, unreasonable or improper; and the defendant claims that it has set up facts which establish the plaintiff\u2019s purpose to be of such character.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\"><em>Section </em>29 of the General Corporation Law in part provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">\u201c The original or duplicate stock ledger containing the names and addresses of the stockholders, and the number of shares held by them, respectively, shall, at all times, during the usual hours for business, be open to the examination of every stockholder at its principal office or place of business in this state.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b375-7\">With respect to the right of a stockholder toienforce, by mandamus proceedings, a statutory right to examine the books of a corporation, there is a lack of uniformity in the jurisdictions throughout the United States. In some jurisdictions it is held that the right is absolute and unqualified, and the issuance of the writ to enforce the right is not within the discretion of the court but is mandatory. <em>Johnson v. </em>Langdon, 135 <em>Cal. </em>624, 67 <em>Pac. </em>1050, 87 <em>Am. St. Rep. </em>156; <em>Cincinnati Volksblatt Co. v. Hoffmeister, </em>62 <em>Ohio St. </em>189, 56 <em>N. E. </em>1033, 48 <em>L. R. A. </em>732, 78 <em>Am. St. Rep. </em>707.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-8\">In the greater number of jurisdictions, however, it is held that while the statutory right is absolute in terms and it is not necessary for the stockholder in his petition in a mandamus proceeding to state reasons for the desired examination, yet the corporation may, by way of defense, establish an illegal or improper motive on the part of the petitioning stockholder such as will, in the discretion of the court, defeat his right to examine the books of the corporation. <em>Foster v. White, </em>86 <em>Ala. </em>467, 6 <em>South. </em>88; <em>Eaton v. Manter, </em>114 <em>Me. </em>259, 95 <em>Atl. </em>948; <em>Knox v. Coburn, </em>117 <em>Me. </em>409, 104 <em>Atl. </em>789; <em>Wight v. Heublein, </em>111 <em>Md. </em>649, 75 <em>Atl. </em>507; <em>O\u2019Hara v. National Biscuit Co., </em>69 <em>N. J.

St. Rep. </em>240.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>The legislature of this state gave a stockholder in a corporation the right to examine the original or duplicate stock ledger of the corporation, and we believe that this statutory right is greater than the common-law right theretofore recognized in this state. After the enactment of the present law, our Supreme Court held that it is not necessary for a stockholder desiring to examine the stock ledger of the corporation to state in his petition reasons or motive in seeking the examination. <em>Bay State Gas Co. v. State, </em>4 <em>Pennewill, </em>238, 56 <em>Atl. </em>1114. The question whether this statutory right of a stockholder may be defeated if the corporation establishes by way of defense, an illegal or improper motive on the part of the petitioning stockholder, is now raised here for the first time.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">The writ of mandamus in its origin was a discretionary writ and is so recognized in this state, and in a number of cases the court here has exercised its discretion in favor of a stockholder and permitted him to inspect and examine books of a corporation. We believe it not to be arguable that, notwithstanding the statutory right, the court could and would properly exercise a discretion adversely to a stockholder\u2019s claim for an inspection, if his purpose should be established by way of defense. In passing the present law the Legislature was silent with respect to the remedy to enforce the right granted, and we believe if the Legislature had intended to remove the discretionary power of the court theretofore existing, and to make the issuance of a writ of mandamus in such cases mandatory upon the court it would have so expressed itself. We are of the opinion that if by way of defense an unlawful or improper motive on the part of the petitioner for the desired inspection of the original or duplicate stock ledger is established, the court may, in the exercise of a sound and reasonable discretion, refuse to issue a peremptory writ to compel such inspection.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-7\">In the present case the return sets forth allegations which, if accepted as facts, establish a purpose on the part of the petitioner altogether foreign to any interest he may have in the corporation or its affairs as a stockholder, or to the interest of a\u00a1ny other stockholder, as such, in the corporation. Neither is there any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>connection between the alleged purpose and the business of the corporation or its management.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">We are of the opinion that .the purpose of the petitioner as alleged in the return to the alternative writ is of such an improper character, that this court would not exercise its discretion in a manner favorable to the consummation of that purpose. Therefore, for the reasons stated, the motion to quash the return to the alternative writ is denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
