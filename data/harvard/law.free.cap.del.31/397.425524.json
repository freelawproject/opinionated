There is no evidence in the case showing, or tending to show, that the defendant was negligent either in the operation of its engine or in equipping its engine with the approved appliances to prevent the escape of fire and sparks. These are the two acts of negligence alleged in plaintiffs\u2019 declaration and relied on by them.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b420-7\">Under the allegations of negligence as in the present case, it is not sufficient for the plantiffs to prove simply that a fire was caused by sparks emitted from defendant\u2019s engine, but that said sparks were emitted, first, either by reason of improper or insufficient equipment of said engine; or, second, that said sparks were emitted on account of negligent and improper operation of said engine. There is no testimony that the fire to the property of plaintiffs below was caused by sparks from defendant\u2019s engine, or that the equipment of defendant\u2019s engine was insufficient, defective or out of order. On the contrary, there is the positive testimony of the inspectors, who inspected the equipment of said engine the evening before and the morning after the fire .that the equipment of said engine was perfect in every way.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b420-8\">It became the duty of the plantiffs below, in order to recover in this action, to introduce some testimony as to negligent operation of management of said engine. This they not only failed to do, but there is the uncontradicted testimony of three witnessess that defendant\u2019s engine was not emitting sparks on the night of the fire as it passed the property of the plaintiffs below, and there is the positive testimony that the locomotive of the defendant on the night of the fire was operated in a careful and skillful manner, while passing property of plaintiffs below. There was absolutely no evidence of negligence in the case to be submitted to the jury, and the court below erred in refusing to instruct the jury, as requested in the first prayer of the defendant below. <em>Jefferis v. P. W. &amp;. B. R.

P. W. &amp;. B. R. R. Co., </em>3 <em>Houst. </em>455, the settled law of this state since 1869, never having been reversed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b421-4\">It is respectfully submitted that while the court below charged the jury as to part of the law of this state in cases like the one at bar, it did not fully state the law, and the jury, in considering the evidence in connection with the law as laid down by the court, might very readily have found:</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b421-5\">1. That if plaintiffs\u2019 barn was set on fire by sparks from defendant\u2019s locomotive, defendant would be liable under any circumstances.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b421-6\">2. That the mere fact that a spark from defendant\u2019s locomotive ignited plaintiffs\u2019 barn, that fact alone would constitute negligence on the part of the defendant for which it would be liable.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b421-7\">3. That the defendant would be liable for any fires caused under any circumstances.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b421-8\">4. That if plaintiffs\u2019 barn was set on fire by sparks from defendant\u2019s locomotive, through an unfortunate and unavoidable accident, nevertheless, the defendant would be liable.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b421-9\">5. That a railroad company in operating its trains becomes liable for all fires occasioned by said operation; or, in other words, that a railroad company operating its engines, properly equipped with the latest known devices and operated by -competent and skillful servants, and operated in a competent and skillful manner, would be liable for any fires occasioned by a spark from one of its locomotives.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b421-10\">It is respectfully submitted that error prejudicial to the defendant below was committed by the court in refusing to charge as prayed for by defendant below.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b421-11\">Considering the sixth assignment of error, it is the well-settled rule of law that a railroad company, in the operation of its railroad, with locomotive engines propelled by steam generated by fire, and drawing its train over its road in the usual and ordinary manner, is not liable for the damage done by the mere unavoidable escape of fire from the engine. <em>St. Louis, etc., R.

This testimony disproves the allegations of negligence contained in the fifth, seventh and eighth counts of the declaration, so that, in order to recover, it became necessary for the plaintiffs below, by affirmative proof, to sustain the allegations contained in the first and second counts, to wit, that the locomotive was negligently, carelessly and - unskilfully operated. It is respectfully submitted that error prejudicial to the defendant below was committed by the court below in refusing to charge as requested in the eighth prayer of the defendant below. <em>Philadelphia &amp; R.

Chicago M. &amp; St. P. Ry. Co., </em>145 <em>Fed. </em>577, 75 <em>C. C. A. </em>591, <em>Patton v. Tex. &amp; Pac. Ry. Co., </em>179 <em>U. S. </em>658, 21 <em>Sup. Ct. </em>275, 45 <em>L.

The purpose of the legislation was simply to change the burden of proof; to raise a presumption against defendant from the scattering coals or sparks by fire, by a locomotive that was either defective, or which might have been avoided by the exercise of reasonable care in its operation. But, even then, it is always a question of fact for the court at the close of the evidence whether or not the presumption of negligence arising from these statutes has been overcome by the evidence of the care exercised by the defendant. <em>Rosen v.

The law in nearly all of the states, as laid down in <em>Jefferis v. P. W. &amp; B. R. R. Co., </em>3 <em>Houst. </em>455, except where there are statutes making such fires prima facie evidence of negligence, is that, in the absence of proof of such negligence on the part of the defendant, a railroad company is not liable for such fires. In- \u2022 deed our own courts in personal injury cases have repeatedly held that no presumptioun of negligence arises from the fact that there was an accident. <em>Igle v. People\u2019s Ry.

Co., 2 Boyce, </em>262, 78 <em>Atl. </em>871.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AHa\">It is respectfully submitted that the court below erred in its instructions to the jury, which is the basis of the tenth assignment of error, for the reason that the only circumstantial evidence in the case was evidence of other fires at other times by other locomotives, all of which evidence was admitted by the court below, against the objection of the defendant. The admissibility of such evidence will be treated at length under assignments of error 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 and 20.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b424-7\">The basis for the eleventh assignment of error is next shown. At the beginning.of the trial counsel for defendant below filed a motion in writing that the court dismiss the array of jurors drawn as additional jurors to try this case, which motion was refused and exception noted for the defendant. This case was first tried at the March term of court, and resulted in a disagreement of the jury on March 9, 1920. Defendant\u2019s counsel asked for a continuance, but the court set down the case for trial on the following Tuesday, March 23d. As there were not sufficient jurors remaining in the panel, exclusive of those who sat at the first trial, to complete the jury at the second trial, the court below by written order directed the jury commissioners to draw nine additional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>jurors, from which \u25a0 together with the remainder of the panel from which the jury in the first trial were drawn to select the jury.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b425-4\">The jury commissioners under the order of the court, drew said additional jurors apportioned as follows: Four from the first district, one from \"the second, pne from the third, one from the fourth, one from the fifth and one from the twelfth. The names of these additional jurors were unknown to defendant\u2019s counsel until the case was called for trial, and, indeed, there were five jurors from the regular panel who had been challenged in the trial of the first cause.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b425-5\">It is respectfully submitted that such order of the court is unauthorized by <em>section </em>4257, <em>Rev. Code, </em>1915, or any other statute in relation to drawing juries. <em>Section </em>4266, <em>Rev. Code, </em>provides in case of deficiency of jurors that the court may award a tales de circumstantibus. The defendant was entitled, if additional jurors were drawn, to have a full panel from which to select the jury. <em>Clinton v. Englebrecht, </em>13 <em>Wall. </em>434, 20 <em>L. Ed. </em>659.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b425-6\">Assignments of error 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 and 20, based on the admission and rejection of certain testimony, will be argued together.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b425-7\">The undisputed evidence in the case goes to show that the only engine of defendant which could by any possibility have caused the fire was engine 1044, and clearly shows that said engine was equipped with a Seiders improved spark arrester, the latest known type of that device, and that the same was in good order and repair. The testimony admitted against objection was all limited to other fires in the locality at other times by other engines of the defendant, and there was not any proof that said engines were similarly equipped and operated as was engine 1044 on the night of the fire.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b425-8\">It is respectfully submitted that this evidence was wrongfully admitted and could only tend to prejudice the minds of the jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>and was of no probative value. <em>Lesser Cotton Co. et al. v.

The fire in question occurred on October 9,1918 and Anderson did not visit the scene of the fire until \u201cthe Sunday before last, the 14th,\u201d so that he did not view the scene of the .fire until one year and five months after the fire had occurred. He was not asked, as an .expert, any hypothetical questions as to what, in his opinion based, on the testimony of the witnesses as to the actual facts on the night of the fire, caused the fire, or whether or not, in his opinion, such fire was caused by sparks from defendant\u2019s locomotive, but simply to testify to the physical facts and conditions at the time he was there. He testified, against the objection of the defendant, to finding cinders on top of the snow <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>on the site of the barn, and also to the fact that there were more cinders near the railroad track than there were upon the site, or between the barn and the railroad track, and that he found cinders as much as 20 feet beyond the site of the barn away from the railroad, and that so far as he could see there were no other means around there that these cinders might have come from except from the railroad track.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b427-4\">There is no testimony in the record that any engines of the defendant passed the site of plaintiffs\u2019 barn, either on the day Anderson viewed the premises, or any time previous thereto. There is no testimony as to how hard or in what direction the wind was blowing the night before Anderson viewed the premises, nor is there any evidence whatsoever as to the equipment of other engines of the defendant, or the manner in which they were operated.There is no evidence as to how the cinders which Anderson saw on the site of the barn got there. By no stretch of the imagination could this testimony as to facts observed seventeen months after the fire be admissible.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b427-5\">All this testimony is so remote as to have no probative value whatsoever and could in no way assist the jury in determining whether or not the fire to plaintiffs\u2019 property was occasioned through the negligence of the defendant either in the equipment of its locomotive or in the operation thereof.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b427-6\">Any deduction from this evidence would be a decision made on a most remote inference, and it could only influence the minds of the jury to the prejudice of the defendant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b427-7\">Argument for Defendant in Error.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b427-8\">The theory upon which the plaintiff in error would seem to base its first assignment of error is that there was nothing in plaintiffs\u2019 case except circumstantial evidence from which it might be presumed that the fire was caused by sparks or fire from a passing locomotive and that there was no evidence of negligent construction or negligent operation.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b427-9\">In most of the states of the Union it is the law that, the origin of the fire being fixed on the railroad company, the plaintiff may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>rest his case there and the law will presume such evidence to be prima facie evidence of negligent operation on the part of the railroad company, and the burden will be shifted to it to prove that it was not negligent. In some states this rule is established by statute, and in others it is the general decisional law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b428-6\"><em>Jefferis v. Railroad Co., </em>3 <em>Houst. </em>447, was decided by the Superior Court, and hence is not controlling on this court; but it is submitted, nevertheless, that the evidence on the part of the plaintiffs below fully met the law as laid down in that case.</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b428-7\">In considering whether there was sufficient evidence on the part of the plaintiffs below to send the case to the jury, the testimony of the witnesses for the plaintiffs below of course should be given the fullest effect. \u2022</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b428-8\">Briefly stated the record discloses that the testimony of the witnesses for the plaintiffs below proved that the barn was desstroyed by fire, that the barn was located about 150 feet from the defendant\u2019s right of way, that shortly before the fire was discovered a train had passed along the defendant\u2019s right of way, that the engines on the right of way habitually emitted a great many sparks, that fires had frequently been discovered in the fields along the defendant\u2019s right of way in the neighborhood of the barn in question shortly after trains had passed, that a fire was once discovered within 5 or 6 feet of the barn shortly after a train had passed, and that there was nothing to which the cause of the fire could reasonably be attributed except sparks or fire from a locomotive passing along the defendant\u2019s right of way.</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b428-9\">It is uniformly held by all the authorities, everywhere, that proof that a fire was caused by sparks from a passing locomotive may be established by circumstantial evidence. Indeed, it is seldom that such fact can be proved in any other way. The jury was justified in finding that the barn in question in this case was set on fire by a spark or sparks from a passing locomotive. There is nothing in the testimony on behalf of either party, from which it may be inferred that the fire may have been caused in sr me other way.</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b429-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>The-important question, however, is whether there was any evidence from which the jury might have found negligence on the part of the defendant, either in the equipment of the engine or in the operation thereof.</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b429-4\">The courts have held that where a building situated some distance from a railroad track has been set on fire by sparks from a passing locomotive this would be held to be substantive and affirmative proof of either negligent operation or want of adequate appliances to prevent the escape of sparks.</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b429-5\">One of the earliest cases on this point is <em>Huyett v.

Courts of high authority hold that the fact that live sparks from a locomotive did cause a fire so far distant from the railroad is itself evidence that the locomotive was not equipped with proper appliances to prevent the emission of sparks, or that such appliances were out of repair, or that the locomotive was being negligently operated.</p>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b429-8\">If there was circumstantial evidence in this case to go to the jury from which they might, if they saw fit, attribute the fire to the railroad company, as there undoubtedly was, the foregoing and following authorities establish the proposition that the great distance from the railroad at which the fire was started is evidence to go to the jury to establish the negligence of the railroad company in starting the fire: <em>Railroad Co. v.

There was testimony on behalf of the defendant below to the effect that a certain train known as \u201cextra 1044\u201d passed the barn about 8 o\u2019clock on the evening of the fire. Aside from the fact that there was no testimony that this engine was the only engine to pass the barn at about 8 o\u2019clock or shortly before that time, there was nothing in the case at the time the witnesses for the plaintiffs below testified to identify the particular engine as \u201cextra 1044\u201d or as any other particular engine.</p>\n<p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b430-7\">The question of the admissibility of such testimony is made the basis of assignments of error Nos. 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 and 20, and it will be discussed when treating of those assignments of error.</p>\n<p data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b430-8\">It is uniformly held that evidence of other fires caused by sparks escaping from other engines of the railroad at other times is evidence of negligence on the part of the railroad company either in the equipment of its locomotives or in the management thereof, as the jury may find. <em>Railroad, Co. v.

It will be seen from the statement of the facts in that case that the proof as to the cause or origin of the fire was no greater than in this case, the only evidence of negligence apparently being proof of other fires at other times and sparks seen, at other times, issuing from the smokestacks of the railroad company\u2019s locomotives. In this case, in addition to this proof, there is the fact of the distance of the location of the barn from the track, the fact that, at the time of the fire, the defendant below was habitually using, on its road past the barn, a locomotive that was not equipped with a spark arrester, and if the fire was attributed by the jury to extra 1044, that hard puffing of the locomotive and the sanding of the track are circumstances from which, taken in connection with the grade and curve of the track, the jury might infer negligent operation consisting in overloading the locomotive, notwithstanding the testimony of defendant\u2019s witnesses that the load was only normal. The jury had the right to accept what evidence they preferred.</p>\n<p data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b431-4\">The court in the Jefferis Case, after laying down the rule as to proof required to be furnished by the plaintiff, held:</p>\n<p data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b431-5\">\u201c That as the case stood, negligence was a question of fact to be decided by the jury, according to the weight or preponderance of the evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b431-6\">See <em>Railroad Co. v.

Chicago M. &amp; St. P. R. Co. </em>hold that the question is one of law for the court only in those cases where the plaintiff has introduced no evidence except such as is sufficient to make out the prima facie presumption under statutes such as those referred to, or under the law in those states which hold such a presumption to exist even in the absence of statute.</p>\n<p data-order=\"75\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b433-6\">In <em>Preece v. Railway Co., </em>24 <em>Utah, </em>493, 68 <em>Pac. </em>413, the court said:</p>\n<p data-order=\"76\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b433-8\">\u201cWhen there is other evidence of negligence than that upon which such prima facie case rests, the question is one for the jury, and not for the court. In the case at bar the plaintiff did not rely solely on the evidence which showed that the fire was started by the defendant\u2019s engine, but introduced other evidence which tended to prove the defendant\u2019s alleged negligence. The case was therefore properly submitted to the jury.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"77\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b433-9\">See, also, <em>Insurance Co. v.

In addition to this there was evidence of the great distance from the railroad at which the fire originated; evidence that the locomotives of the defendant habitually threw out sparks when puffing hard; evidence that a locomotive equipped with a spark arrester will <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>throw out sparks when its wheels are slipping; also, when cinders are allowed to accumulate in the front end; also when the fire is tended in a certain way; evidence that a certain locomotive of the defendant that passed the barn shortly before the fire was discovered, to wit, extra 1044, was puffing hard when near the barn, and that sand was then being applied to the rails, and that the locomotive was then drawing a long train of from 16 to 18 freight cars upon a curving track up an ascending grade from which facts the jury might if they saw fit infer' want of a proper spark arrester, or a defect in the spark arrester, or negligent operation consisting in either failure to keep the front end of the locomotive clean or improper fixing or overloading the engine, notwithstanding the verbal testimony of the defendant\u2019s employees to the effect that the locomotive in question was equipped with a proper spark arrester and that the same was in good repair and that the locomotive was being carefully operated.</p>\n<p data-order=\"80\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b434-4\">As to the eleventh assignment of error, <em>Rev. Code </em>1915, \u00a74 266, being the same as <em>section </em>2377, <em>Rev.

In like manner a deficiency of the petit jurors may be supplied, when by reason of challenges, or otherwise, a sufficient number are not ready for the trial of a cause.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"82\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b434-6\">See action of court apparently under authority of said section in <em>State v.

The locomotive that caused the fire was never identified during the trial by either plaintiffs\u2019 or defendant\u2019s evidence. It is true that it was testified by several witnesses for the defendant below that locomotive 1044 passed the barn about 8 o\u2019clock p. m., but no witness testified that no other locomotive passed about the same time. About 8 o\u2019clockmay mean shortly \"before or shortly after that hour and clearly covers a period of time within which several trains can pass a given point. The discovery of the fire about 15 minutes after the passing of a train at about 8 o\u2019clock does not connect the fire with that train. Another train is known to have passed not more than two hours before and others may have p\u00e1ssed in the interval. It is matter of common knowledge that a spark falling on dry straw or other highly combustible material may start an active conflagration quickly, and falling on a roof may smoulder for a long time, even hours, until a sudden breeze from the right direction causes the fire to break into flame.</p>\n<p data-order=\"86\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b435-5\">What is a sufficient identification of a locomotive as the cause of a fire is made clear by the text of <em>Elliott on Ev. </em>\u00a7 188; also <em>Elliott on Railroads, </em>\u00a7 1243a.</p>\n<p data-order=\"87\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b435-6\">All the authorities cited by counsel for the defendant below deal with cases where the engine in question was identified. It is evident from these authorities that evidence of other fires at other times is admissible where the engine which caused the fire is unknown or unidentified. As a matter'of fact all the authorities hold.to this effect uniformly.</p>\n<p data-order=\"88\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b435-7\">We shall cite on this point only the case of <em>Chicago, St. P., M. &amp; O.

This case was tried befo j\u00e9 a jury in the Superior Court in New Castle county and a verdict rendered in favor of the plaintiffs below, upon which judgment was entered, and the case is in this court on a writ of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-8\">The counts of the declaration, not abandoned at the trial, charge that the barn and contents of. the plaintiffs below were destroyed by a conflagration caused by sparks or fire emitted from a locomotive or locomotives of the defendant below by reason of either (a) the negligent operation of a locomotive, or (b) the negligent failure to equip its locomotives with appliances to prevent the escape of fire and sparks from their smokestacks, or (c) the negligent failure to equip its locomotives with appliances to prevent the escape of fire from their ash pans and fire boxes.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-9\">The facts that were proved below and are pertinent here may be thus stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b436-10\">About 8 o\u2019clock on the evening of October 9, 1918, a barn owned by the plaintiffs below, located near Guyencourt station in Christiana Hundred, along the right of way of the defendant below, was found to be on fire, the result of which fire was the total destruction of the barn and its contents. No one actually saw the barn set on fire, and hence there was no direct testimony to .show the cause of the fire, the testimony on behalf of the plaintiffs below for the purpose being circumstantial.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-11\">About 4.30 on the afternoon of the day of the fire a colored <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>man named Walter Washington had been in the barn getting ready to milk and after he finished milking he put the milk away and let the cows out and then went to the house where he lived, which was three or four minutes\u2019 walk from the barn. At that time no lights of any kind were being used, the work being done by daylight. There were no electric lights or lamps used in the barn, and no lights had been used there for months, it being summer and the work being finished by daylight. Between 6 o\u2019clock and the time of the fire two trains on the railroad of the plaintiff in error passed by the barn, one a little after 6, and another one about 8 o\u2019clock. The fire was discovered about 8 o\u2019clock or shortly thereafter, about 15 minutes after the second train above mentioned had passed. The barn in question was located about 150 feet from the defendant\u2019s right of way. There had been other fires, on other occasions, on the farm on which the barn was located, no cause for which could be assigned, except that they were caused by sparks or fire from locomotives passing along the railroad of the defendant below. One such fire was discovered within 5 to 6 feet of the said barn. The locomotives running on the said railroad had emitted a great many sparks on numerous other occasions. One of the locomotives of the defendant below, accustomed to run past the said barn at the time of the fire, was not equipped with a spark arrester at that time. Witnesses for the defendant below testified that a certain train, described as \u201cspecial 1044\u201d or \u201cextra 1044,\u201d passed the barn in question, going toward Wilmington, about eight o\u2019clock on the evening of the fire; that the engine drawing this train was equipped with an improved spark arrester, which had been examined before the trip began and after the trip ended, and was found to be in good order; and that the engine was carefully operated.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-4\">At the time of the fire the wind was blowing from the direction of the railroad track toward the said barn.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">The railroad track, as it approaches the location of the barn going toward Wilmington, is both curved and an ascending grade.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">A witness for plaintiffs below testified he lived on the farm on which the said barn was located during the year preceding that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>in which the fire occurred and had experienced a number of fires on the farm which had happened \u201cright after the train passed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">\u201cExtra 1044\u201d was a freight train consisting of a locomotive and 16 to 18 cars. The load of the train was about 1,200 tons.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-7\">Macklin, an experienced locomotive engineer, testifying for plaintiffs, said a heavy train using a great deal of coal would cause red-hot cinders to accumulate in the \u201cfront end\u2019 \u2019 of the locomotive, and this would cause more sparks to get through the spark arrester and go out the stack. Such accumulation should be cleaned out during the run of the train. He also testified that grades, curves, the method in which the fire is t\u00e9nded by the fireman, and the slipping of the engine all tend to cause the locomotive to throw out sparks.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-8\">Bampton, the engineer of \u201cextra 1044,\u201d testifying for the defendant below, said that sand is used on the track to prevent the locomotive from slipping. He also said that just before he got to the Ramsey farm he was putting sand on the track and when near the said barn he was out on top of his locomotive at the sand dome fixing it so that the sand would ran down on the track. He stated, nevertheless, that the engine was not slipping.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-9\">There are 21 assignments of error; the twelfth and twenty-first are not relied on.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-10\">The first assignment of error is the refusal of the court below to direct a verdict in favor of the defendant below at the close of all the testimony in accordance with the defendant\u2019s first prayer.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-11\">The basis of this contention is, first, that the plaintiff below failed to show that the fire was caused by sparks from defendant\u2019s locomotive, and, second, that there was no evidence of negligent construction or negligent operation of such locomotive.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-12\">It was shown by the testimony of the witnesses for plaintiff below that the barn was located about 150 feet from defendant\u2019s right of way, that about 2 hours before the fire was discovered a train had passed along defendant\u2019s right of way, and shortly before the fire was discovered (about 15 minutes) another train had passed along defendant\u2019s right of way; that the engines on the right of way habitually emitted a great many sparks; that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>fires had frequently been discovered in the fields along the right of way in the vicinity of the barn shortly after trains had passed; that a fire was once discovered within 5 or 6 feet of the barn shortly after a train had passed; and that there was nothing to which the cause of the fire in question could reasonably be attributed except to sparks or fire from a locomotive passing along defendant\u2019s right of way.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\"> That the fire was caused by a spark from a passing locomotive may be proved by circumstantial evidence we have no doubt. Indeed, it is the usual way of proving such fact. There is in this case sufficient evidence from which the jury might find that the fire in question was caused by a spark from a locomotive on the railroad of the defendant below.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\"> There being evidence from which the jury could have found that the fire was caused by one of defendant\u2019s locomotives, is there further evidence in the case from which the jury could be justified in finding negligence, in either the construction, or operatian of such locomotive? Under the law in this state, as laid .down in <em>Jefferis v. Railroad Co., </em>3 <em>Roust. </em>447, which was closely followed by the court below in this case, it is not sufficient for the plaintiffs to prove that a spark from a locomotive of defendant set fire to the barn, but he must show by other evidence additional facts from which the jury may find negligence. The law as thus declared in the Jefferis Case is not challenged by counsel for plaintiffs below, but he contends that such additional facts were shown, which justified the court in submitting the case to the jury, and the jury in finding the defendant negligent either in the equipment or operation of one of its locomotives on the evening of the fire. It having been shown that a building was set on fire by a spark from a locomotive, the distance of such building from the railroad may be evidence of negligence in equipment, or operation.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-10\">In <em>Huyett v. Railroad Co., </em>23 <em>Pa. </em>373, the fire was started 73 feet from the right of way; held to be evidence of negligence. So in <em>Louisville &amp; N. R. Co. v. Malone, </em>109 <em>Ala. </em>509, 20 <em>South. </em>33, where the distance was 63 feet. In <em>Railroad Co. v. Scheible, </em>162 <em>Ky. </em>469, 172 S. <em>W. </em>910, the building destroyed was from 80 to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>90 feet away. In <em>Railroad Co. v. Quaintance, </em>58 <em>Ill. </em>389, the court said:</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">\"It is conceded by the witness Jackman, who is doubtless a skillful and learned man in his profession, that if the engine, at the time in question, did throw fire sparks to the distance of ISO feet, of sufficient size and of life enough to ignite the house, it must necessarily have been out of repair.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b440-7\">The distance of the barn in the case at bar was 150 feet from the right of way of the defendant, which is a very unusual distance for a live spark to carry, and if the jury believed it did carry that far and ignite the barn, it would be especially strong proof of defective equipment or operation or both.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-8\">Evidence of other fires, along the right of way at other times, the cause for which is not accounted for, except by sparks from passing locomotives, is admissible and is evidence of negligence, when the engine that set the fire is not identified. <em>Railroad Co. v. Richardson, </em>91 <em>U. S. </em>474, 23 <em>L. Ed. </em>356; <em>Northern Pacific </em>v. <em>Lewis, </em>51 <em>Fed. </em>664, 2 <em>C. C. A. </em>446; <em>Gowen v. Glaser (Pa.) </em>10 <em>Atl. </em>417; <em>Field v. New York Central R. Co., </em>32 <em>N. Y. </em>339; <em>Bright Hope Ry. Co. v. Rogers, </em>76 <em>Va. </em>443.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-9\">The identity of the engine in this case is more fully considered under assignments of error Nos. 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, and 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-10\">Even if the jury believed the spark that set the fire came from engine No. 1044, and further believed said engine was equipped with sufficient spark arrester, the jury may, nevertheless, consider the evidence of the manner in which the engine was being operated around the curved track, up grade, the weight of the train, and the emission of sparks on the evening of the fire as evidence of negligent operation.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-11\">We are clearly of the opinion the court was not in error in refusing to charge the jury to find a verdict in favor of the defendant, and in submitting the case to the jury for its determination upon the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-12\">Our finding on the first assignment of error would seem to dispose of the eighth assignment also; and while that assignment was fully and ably presented by counsel on both sides, we feel -nothing will be accomplished by a further examination of a question necessarily considered in deciding the first assignment.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>The second, third, fifth, sixth, seventh and ninth assignments of error allege failure of the court below to charge the jury in accordance with the several prayers mentioned in such assignments.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-4\">We are of the opinion that the substance and effect of the instructions requested by the defendant below in those prayers were given by the court below in its charge to the jury, and, while there could have been no objection to the court applying the law, charged by them, somewhat more specifically to the facts of the case on trial, we think the instructions prayed for by the defendant below were covered by the charge of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">The fourth assignment alleges that the court erred in refusing to instruct the jury:</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">\u201c That the defendant had an unquestioned right to operate the railroad by engines propelled by steam generated by fire.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b441-7\">There was no issue in the case as to the right of the defendant to so operate the road, and, therefore, no occasion for the court to instruct the jury on the point.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-8\">The tenth assignment charges the court below erred in instructing the jury:</p>\n<p id=\"b441-9\">\u201cWhether the alleged firing of plaintiffs\u2019 property resulted from the alleged acts of negligence of the defendant company, or any of them, may be shown by either direct or circumstantial evidence\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b441-10\">\u2014 for the reason that the only circumstantial evidence in the case was evidence of other fires at other times, which evidence was inadmissible and should have been ruled out.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-11\">Aside from the admissibility of evidence of other fires, there is evidence of other circumstances from which the jury might have inferred negligence in the equipment or operation of the defendant\u2019s engine which caused the fire.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-12\">The eleventh assignment of error is based upon the refusal of the court below to dismiss the array of jurors drawn as additional jurors from which panel a jury to try this case was drawn, for the reason that the additional jurors were drawn and summoned contrary to the statutes of this state.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-13\">It is not disclosed by the record how the additional jurors were drawn and summoned. The authority of the court to keep <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>in attendance the requisite number of jurors to serve the court is very broad. <em>Section </em>4266, <em>Code </em>1915, provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b442-4\">\u201cIf at any court a sufficient number of grand or petit jurors, drawn and summoned as aforesaid, do not appear; or if the panel returned by the sheriff be quashed by the court, the court may award a tales de circumstantibus, or make such other order as it may deem expedient for filling up the requisite number of jurors to serve at such court. In like manner a deficiency of the petit jurors may be supplied, when, by reason of challenges, or otherwise, a sufficient number are not ready for the trial of a cause.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">The thirteenth, fourteenth, fifteenth, sixteenth, seventeenth and twentieth assignments of error go to the admission of testimony of witnesses of plaintiff below as to other fires caused by engines of the defendant below at other time's in the vicinity of the barn in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">There seems to be a marked uniformity in the decisions of the courts relating to the admission of such evidence. The rule is that testimony of other fires is admissible when the identity of the engine which set out the fire is a disputed question for the jury to determine and is not admissible when the identity of the engine is admitted, or is so conclusively proven, as no longer to be a disputed fact for the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-7\">The cases cited by counsel for plaintiff in error in his argument on this branch of the case, as well as many others, fully support this rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-8\">If the fire that destroyed the barn in the case at bar was caused by an engine of the defendant, was the identity of such engine a disputed question of fact to be determined by the jury? The defendant below did not admit that the fire was started by a spark from its engine No. 1044, but contended that, if it was started from any engine, it must have been from No. 1044.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-9\">The testimony on this point showed that the fire occurred about 8 o\u2019clock in the evening; that a little after 6 o\u2019clock one train passed, and about 8 o\u2019clock another train passed; and shortly thereafter, probably about 15 minutes, the fire was discovered. It is not disclosed by the evidence whether or not any other engine passed that point within a time when it would be reasonable to infer that the fire could have started from a spark from it.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>A careful consideration of the evidence satisfies us that the origin of the fire was a disputed fact to be determined by the jury, and that, in determining that fact, there was evidence from which it might find the fire to have been started from some engine of the defendant below, other than engine No. 1044. The court below, therefore, did not err in admitting evidence of other fires.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-4\">The eighteenth and nineteenth assignments of error are based upon the admission of, and -the refusal to strike out, the testimony of Henry Anderson, a witness for the plaintiffs below.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">Anderson testified that about a year and five months after the fire he was at the site of the burned barn and\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">\u201cnoted that the greater part of the site of the bam was covered with freshly fallen snow. The surface was white, with the exception of cinders, which were lying oh the top of the snow. * * * There were more cinders near the railroad track than there were upon the site or between the site of the bam and the track; that is, they increased as you got nearer to the railroad track.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b443-8\">Witness stated the size of the cinders to be an eighth of an inch or larger; that he found cinders as much as twenty feet beyond the barn site, away from the railroad, making a total of approximately 200 feet from the railroad track to the last cinders found there in any appreciable quantity; that witness could conceive of no other means around there where these cinders might have come from except from the railroad track; that the cinders were on the top of the snow, and had apparently fallen there.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-9\">Counsel for plaintiff in error contends that this testimony is irrelevant, immaterial and inadmissible; that it is of no probative value whatever, and any deductions from it could only influence the minds of the jury to the prejudice of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-10\">Defendant in error argues that Anderson\u2019s testimony was harmless from any viewpoint, but may be considered as admissible upon the same theory that testimony of \u201cother fires\u201d at other times, in the case of an unidentified locomotive is admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-11\">The broadest inference that can be drawn from Anderson\u2019s testimony is that cinders might be carried from a locomotive on defendant\u2019s railroad to -the site of the barn and 20 feet beyond. There is nothing in his testimony or in the testimony of any other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>witness to show whether the cinders were alive or dead when deposited upon the snow, or what the wind and other conditions were at the time the cinders were deposited upon the snow. We think the evidence is without probative force, and was not admissible on the theory that evidence of \u201cother fires\u201d is admissible, and should have been excluded by the court below. And while we have been in some doubt as to the effect of its admission, after a careful consideration of all the evidence in the case, we are of the opinion that the judgment should not for that reason be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">The judgment below is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-7\">Judge Rice dissenting.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
