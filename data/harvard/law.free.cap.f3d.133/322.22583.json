GARZA, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b408-31\">Joann A. Parker (\u201cMrs. Parker\u201d) appeals her conviction and sentence for conspiracy to commit pubhc bribery and five counts of pubhc bribery in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 201(b)(2)(C) and 371. Ralph Parker (\u201cMr. Parker\u201d) appeals his conviction for con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>spiracy to commit public bribery and three counts of public bribery under the same statutes. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">The Social Security Administration (\u201cSSA\u201d) Office of Hearings and Appeals employed Mrs. Parker as a clerk to Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) John Aronson. She led a group that helped certain individuals to fraudulently obtain Supplemental Security Income (\u201cSSI\u201d) benefits in return for money.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The scheme began when Mrs. Parker met Niknitta Simmons (\u201cSimmons\u201d) at a hearing where Simmons was appealing the denial of SSI benefits for her son, Kevin Simmons. ALJ Aronson advised Simmons that additional documentation would be necessary for a favorable ruling on Kevin\u2019s claim. Mrs. Parker approached Simmons after the hearing and offered to help. A few days later, Mrs. Parker gave Simmons a letter approving Kevin\u2019s benefits. Mrs. Parker thereafter called Simmons and demanded money for her help. Simmons refused to pay, and Kevin\u2019s benefits were terminated. Mrs. Parker advised Simmons that Kevin\u2019s benefits would be reinstated if Simmons paid her.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">Simmons went to several SSA offices and reported Mrs. Parker\u2019s demands. Investigators from the SSA and FBI contacted Simmons, and she agreed to assist them by permitting FBI Agent Karen Jenkins to record her telephone conversations with Mrs. Parker. In multiple recorded conversations, Mrs. Parker demanded payment for having Kevin\u2019s benefits approved initially and for having those benefits reinstated. At a meeting at Simmons\u2019 home, Mrs. and Mr. Parker took $500, as captured on videotape by the FBI. Mrs. Parker thereafter demanded more money, which Simmons paid, and Mrs. Parker gave Simmons a letter purportedly bearing ALJ Aronson s signature reinstating Kevin\u2019s benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-10\">Agent Jenkins and a SSA agent interviewed Mrs. Parker about her contacts with Simmons. The agents advised Mrs. Parker of her rights and she signed a written waiver before confessing to fraudulently approving benefits for Kevin Simmons, Raymond Henry, Georgette Lemon, Yvette Scott, and Karen Johnson. Mrs. Parker stated that two other SSA employees had assisted her and implicated Mr. Parker. Mrs. Parker admitted that she had approved benefits by taking letters addressed to different persons, changing the names and dates of those letters to match those of the applicants who had paid her money, and forging the signature of ALJ Aronson.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-11\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b409-12\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b409-13\">Mrs. Parker first argues that the indictment charging her with conspiracy to commit public bribery and public bribery under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 201(b)(2)(C) was deficient because she lacked the authority to grant or deny benefits. Mrs. Parker\u2019s duties included assisting ALJ Aronson before and during the hearings, recording and taking notes at those hearings, and typing and mailing ALJ Aron-son\u2019s decisions. Mrs. Parker had access to the office\u2019s computer system, but was not authorized to approve benefits or sign ALJ Aronson\u2019s name. Thus, Mrs. Parker essentially argues that the only acts which we should examine in determining whether she violated section 201(b)(2)(C) are those within the scope of her authority, such as typing and mailing opinions.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-14\">Section 201(b)(2)(C) prohibits public officials from being induced to do or omit any act in violation of their official duty.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Acts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>that violate an official\u2019s duty are extremely broad in scope. Section 201(a) broadly defines an \u201cofficial act\u201d as \u201cany decision or action on any question, matter, cause, suit, proceeding or controversy, which may at any time be pending, or which may by law be brought before any public official, in such official\u2019s official capacity, or in such' official\u2019s place of trust or profit.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 201(a)(3). This broad definition of \u201cofficial act\u201d reflects Congress\u2019 intent to \u201cinclude any decision or action taken by a public official in his capacity as such.\u201d S.Rep. No. 87-2213, (1962), <em>reprinted in </em>1962 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3852, 3856. Official acts that violate an official\u2019s official duty are not limited to those proscribed by statutes and written rules and regulations, but may also be found in \u201cestablished usage,\u201d because \u201cduties not completely defined by written rules are established by settled practice, and action taken in the course of their performance must be regarded as within the provisions of the above-mentioned statutes against bribery.\u201d <em>United States v. Birdsall, </em>233 U.S. 223, 231, 34 S.Ct. 512, 514-15, 58 L.Ed. 930 (1914). Official acts that violate an official\u2019s official duty are also not limited to those within the official\u2019s specific authority. <em>See e.g., United States v. Gjieli, </em>717 F.2d 968, 972 (6th Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\">Mrs. Parker does not dispute that the individuals for whom she fraudulently approved benefits had appeals pending in her office. Because the appeals were pending in her \u201cplace of trust or profit,\u201d her actions fall within the statutory definition of \u201cofficial act.\u201d <em>See United States v. Dobson, </em>609 F.2d 840, 842 (5th Cir.1980) (holding that the actions of a government employee in preparing a memorandum fell within the definition of an \u201cofficial act\u201d because the decision in question was pending in his \u201cplace of trust or profit\u201d). Her abuse of the SSA facilities and equipment and the responsibility that ALJ Aronson gave her enabled her to alter and forge the decisions. Mrs. Parker could create fictitious letters approving benefits because she had access to the official networked computer system. She was able to \u201ccut and paste\u201d segments of one document onto another and make them appear real. As access to government computer systems becomes more prevalent, opportunities for this kind of nefarious behavior will become more common. We therefore hold that the term \u201cofficial act\u201d encompasses use of governmental computer systems to fraudulently create documents for the benefit of the employee or a third party for compensation, even when the employee\u2019s scope of authority does not formally encompass the act. <em>See e.g., United States v. Carson, </em>464 F.2d 424, 433 (2nd Cir.1972) (interpreting the bribery statute broadly to cover a congressional aide\u2019s attempts to intercede with Executive Branch officials on behalf of bribers even though the scope of his job authority did not extend to such intercession). Mrs. Parker\u2019s actions were thus covered by section 201(b)(2)(C) and the indictment was not deficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-8\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b410-9\">Mr. and Mrs. Parker argue that the district court erred in barring cross-examination of the witness Yvette Scott on pending state charges that Scott murdered her husband. At trial, they both argued that the charge was relevant to show Scott\u2019s general lack of credibility. The court barred mention of the pending state charges because it held that \u201c[t]hreatening to kill her husband or killing her husband has nothing to do with the facts of this case.\u201d On appeal, Mrs. Parker argues that cross-examination should have been allowed to show Scott\u2019s lack of credibility. Mr. Parker argues for the first time on appeal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>that such cross-examination would have shown that Scott had an incentive to slant her testimony in this case in favor of the government to receive a favorable recommendation in the pending state ease.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-4\">As the lower court correctly noted, Fed.R.Evid. 609 permits impeachment by evidence of past convictions, but does not apply to crimes charged for which there has been no conviction. <em>See United States v. Abadie, </em>879 F.2d 1260, 1267 (5th Cir.1989) (holding that an arrest is generally not admissible to impeach the general credibility of a witness). Prior bad acts that have not resulted in a conviction are admissible under Fed.R.Evid. 608(b) if relevant to the witness\u2019s character for truthfulness or untruthfulness. Violent crimes, however, are irrelevant to a witness\u2019s character for truthfulness. <em>See </em>Charles Alan Wright &amp; Victor James Gold, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 6118 (1993). Accordingly, the district court did not abuse its discretion denying cross-examination to show Scott\u2019s general lack of credibility, and we reject Mrs. Parker\u2019s argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">With regard to Mr. Parker\u2019s argument that cross-examination on the pending state charges would have demonstrated possible bias, even assuming the applicability of Rule 608(b), reversal would still not be required. Mr. Parker has presented no evidence that federal prosecutors agreed to give a favorable recommendation for or intercede on behalf of Simmons in the pending state ease. <em>See United States v. Benavidez, </em>664 F.2d 1255, 1262 (5th Cir.1982) (holding trial court\u2019s refusal to allow impeachment of a witness\u2019s credibility on pending state charges did not violate the Confrontation Clause because no evidence existed of any deal between the government and witness to testify favorably). Moreover, any error that may have occurred was harmless. <em>See Delaware v. Van Arsdall, </em>475 U.S. 673, 680, 106 S.Ct. 1431, 1436, 89 L.Ed.2d 674 (1986). Scott\u2019s testimony was substantially corroborated by the testimony of Georgette Lemon and other government witnesses. Thus, even if the trial court erred in not allowing cross-examination on the pending state charges to demonstrate possible bias, such error was harmless, and we reject Mr. Parker\u2019s argument as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-7\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b411-8\">Mrs. Parker next argues that the district court erred in excusing venire member 47, who stated that he would have a \u201chealthy skepticism for evidence brought into court\u201d and that he would be suspicious of the government\u2019s evidence before he saw it. She also avers that the judge\u2019s questioning of venire member 47 was so loud that the entire venire could hear the questioning, and that this questioning cowed the jury into believing that they were required to accept the government\u2019s evidence as correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-9\">In noncapital cases, removal of a venire member generally is not grounds for reversal unless \u201cthe jurors who actually sat were not impartial within the meaning of the Sixth Amendment.\u201d <em>United States v. Gonzalez-Balderas, 11 F.3d 1218, </em>1222 (5th Cir.1994). A potential juror is properly excused for cause when the individual\u2019s views would prevent or substantially impair the performance of their duties as a juror. <em>See United States v. Flores, </em>63 F.3d 1342, 1354 (5th Cir.1995). In addition to stating that he had a \u201chealthy skepticism\u201d for evidence, venire member 47 stated that he would be suspicious of the evidence before he had seen it based on his brother-in-law\u2019s recent criminal conviction. Therefore, the court did not abuse its discretion in dismissing venire member 47.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-10\">Mrs. Parker has presented no evidence that the jurors who actually sat were not impartial. Indeed, even after the judge\u2019s exchange with venire member 47, other veni-re members approached the bench to inquire about possible disqualifications. Their exchanges with the judge do not reflect any sense of intimidation by the judge\u2019s exchange with venire member 47. The judge also instructed the jury that they should decide the case only on the evidence presented in court and according to the court\u2019s instructions. In the absence of evidence to the contrary, we find that the jury was impartial, and that Mrs. Parker\u2019s rights were not prejudiced. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number><em>See United States v. Prati </em>861 F.2d 82, 87 (5th Cir.1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b412-4\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">Mr. Parker argues that the district court abused its discretion on two evi-dentiary rulings. We review evidentiary rulings only for abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Torres, </em>114 F.3d 520, 526 (5th Cir.1997). In the first ruling, FBI Agent Jenkins testified that \u201cAs soon as I arrived [at Simmons\u2019 house], I learned that Mrs. Parker had just called Simmons and demanded money.\u201d The trial court allowed the statement to be introduced only for the limited purpose of establishing background information on why Agent Jenkins began the investigation, a use which we have repeatedly approved in the past. <em>See e.g., United States v. Carrillo, </em>20 F.3d 617, 619 (5th Cir.1994) (allowing testimony of detective concerning background information that led detectives to purchase drugs from defendant). The court also gave two limiting instructions to the jury explaining that the statement was not admitted for the truth of the matter asserted.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Thus, the district court did not abuse its discretion in admitting this statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">In the second ruling, Peggy Kelly testified about a telephone conversation she had with a man who referred to Mrs. Parker as his \u201cold lady\u201d and who threatened Kelly. Kelly stated that she thought that the man on the telephone was Mr. Parker and her reasons for so thinking, but admitted that she could not identify his voice and that she had never previously met him. Mr. Parker argues that the government therefore failed to properly establish the evidentiary foundation for the telephone conversation. \u201cWhile a mere assertion of identity by a person talking on the telephone is not in itself sufficient to authenticate that person\u2019s identity, some additional evidence, which \u2018need not fall in[to] any set pattern,\u2019 may provide the necessary foundation.\u201d <em>United States v. Khan, </em>53 F.3d 507, 516 (2nd Cir.1995) (quoting Fed. R.Evid. 901(b)(6), Advisory Committee notes, example 6).</p>\n<p id=\"b412-9\">Here, the trial court found sufficient circumstantial evidence to indicate that the man on the telephone was Mr. Parker because Mrs. Parker placed the call to Kelly, and, thereafter, a man interrupted the telephone conversation and stated that Mrs. Parker was his \u201cold lady.\u201d Based on this circumstantial evidence, we affirm the district court\u2019s finding that the government established a foundation for the conversation. Once the government established this foundation, it became the province of the jury to decide whether Mr. Parker was indeed the man on the phone and whether he made the threats; as the conversation was relevant to this determination, it was properly admissible under Fed.R.Evid. 401. Accordingly, we reject Mr. Parker\u2019s argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-10\">E</p>\n<p id=\"b412-11\">Mrs. Parker argues that the evidence was insufficient to support her conviction. Because she failed to move for a judgment of acquittal at the close of the evidence, we review only for plain error. <em>See United States v. McCarty, </em>36 F.3d 1349, 1358 (5th Cir.1994). A conviction may be reversed under the plain error standard only to avoid a manifest miscarriage of justice. <em>Id. </em>\u201cSuch a miscarriage would exist only if the record is devoid of evidence pointing to guilt, or ... because the evidence on a key element of the offense was so tenuous that a conviction would be shocking.\u201d <em>United States v. Pierre, </em>958 F.2d 1304, 1310 (5th Cir.1992) (en banc). After a thorough review of the record, we find that the record is not so devoid of evidence pointing to guilt or so tenuous on a key element of the offense that her conviction would be shocking and, accordingly, we decline to reverse her conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-12\">F</p>\n<p id=\"b412-13\">Finally, Mrs. Parker alleges various errors in her sentencing and the court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>adoption of the Presentence Report (\u201cPSR\u201d). We review the trial court\u2019s legal interpretation and application of sentencing guidelines <em>de novo </em>and its factual findings in connection with sentencing for clear error. <em>See United States v. Ismoila, </em>100 F.3d 380, 394 (5th Cir.1996). Facts contained in a PSR are considered reliable and may be adopted without further inquiiy if the defendant fails to present competent rebuttal evidence. <em>See United States v. Puig-Infante, </em>19 F.3d 929, 943 (5th Cir.1994). Such rebuttal evidence must demonstrate that the PSR information is .\u201cmaterially untrue, inaccurate or unreliable,\u201d <em>see United States v. Angulo, </em>927 F.2d 202, 205 (5th Cir.1991). Mere objections do not suffice as competent rebuttal evidence. <em>See Puig-Infante, </em>19 F.3d at 943.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-4\">Mrs. Parker first argues that the court erred in considering the confession she made to Agent Jenkins in deciding her sentence. We reject this argument because the statement was admissible and was introduced at trial. <em>See United States v. Collins, </em>40 F.3d 95, 98 (5th Cir.1994). Moreover, at sentencing, \u201cthe court may,consider relevant information without regard to its admissibility under the rules of evidence applicable at trial, provided that the information has sufficient indicia of reliability to support its probable accuracy.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 6A1.3 (Nov. 1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">Mrs. Parker next alleges that the district court erred in crediting the part of the PSR that stated that Mrs. Parker took $8,000 from Peggy Kelly\u2019s sister in the bathroom of a Wendy\u2019s restaurant for obtaining benefits. We reject her argument because she failed to present any rebuttal evidence to support her argument. Moreover, the jury convicted Mrs. Parker on one count of taking money from Peggy Kelly\u2019s sister and therefore, the court only adopted what the jury had previously determined.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">Mrs. Parker alleges that the victim impact portion of the PSR is deficient because it overstates the victim impact. She argues that the only victims in this ease were the individuals from whom she took money and only their payments to her should be considered in affixing the amount of the loss. The PSR identified the SSA as the victim, stated that the total fraudulent claims amounted to $69,673.85, and broke down the claims by each individual, which the district court as being both accurate and reliable. Loss calculations will be affirmed so long as they reasonably estimate the loss using reasonably available information. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2F1.1, cmt. 8; <em>United States v. Chappell, </em>6 F.3d 1095, 1101 (5th Cir.1993). Mrs. Parker failed to present any rebuttal evidence and while the individuals from whom Mrs. Parker extorted money may have been victims,' the SSA was also a victim because it paid monies due to Mrs. Parker\u2019s actions that it otherwise might not have paid. <em>Cf. United States v. Sidhu, </em>130 F.3d 644, 653-54 (5th Cir.1997) (holding that for doctor\u2019s fraud, the victim impact should include not just amounts collected from patients, but amounts collected from insurance companies as well). Therefore, we reject Mrs. Parker\u2019s argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-9\">Mrs. Parker also argues that the district court erred in increasing her offense level under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B3.2 based on its finding that her offense involved threats of physical injury and property destruction.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> A conspirator may be held liable for the substantive offenses of a eoconspirator when the acts are reasonably foreseeable and are done in furtherance of the conspiracy, even where the first conspirator lacked knowledge of or participation in the acts. <em>See Pinkerton v. United States, </em>328 U.S. 640, 647-48, 66 S.Ct. 1180, 1184-85, 90 L.Ed. 1489 (1946). The trial court found that the threats were made by Mr. Parker, but that the threats were attributable to Mrs. Parker because they were coconspirators and his actions were reasonably foreseeable by her. Absent competent rebuttal evidence, the court properly adopted these facts. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.3(a)(1)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b413-10\">Mrs. Parker argues that the district court erred in increasing her offense level pursuant to \u00a7 3Bl.l(e) of the Guidelines for her leadership role. We review this sentence enhancement only for clear error, <em>see United States v. Narvaez, </em>38 F.3d 162, 166 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>(5th Cir.1994), and no clear error results if the finding is plausible in light of the record read as a whole. <em>See United States v. Watson, </em>966 F.2d 161, 162 (5th Cir.1992). The record of this case and testimony by government witnesses at trial fully supports the district court\u2019s finding that Mrs. Parker exercised a leadership role in altering SSA documents. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1, cmt. 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-4\">Finally, Mrs. Parker argues that the court erred in fading to consider her medical condition and her financial circumstances in imposing her sentence and ordering her to pay restitution, citing U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5H1.4 and \u00a7 5E1.2. We reject this contention because the district court considered her medical condition and financial circumstances before imposing the sentence and it explicitly declined to reduce her sentence. <em>See United States v. Winters, </em>105 F.3d 200, 208 (5th Cir.1997); <em>United States v. Guajardo, </em>950 F.2d 203, 208 (5th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">The convictions of Joann Parker and Ralph Parker are AFFIRMED and the sentence of Joann Parker is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b409-7\">. SSI benefits are means-based benefits for needy elderly, blind, and disabled persons. An applicant for SSI first fills out an application for benefits at a local SSA office. If the initial application is denied, then the applicant may reapply. After the application has been denied twice, an applicant may appeal to the SSA Office of Hearing and Appeals, where an ALJ will review the file and, if necessary, order a hearing. The ALJ will issue a written opinion granting or denying SSI benefits, a copy of which is mailed in a letter to the applicant. The ALJ also may determine that the disability began at some prior point in time and order a lump-sum back payment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b409-16\">. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 201 provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-17\">(b) Whoever\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>(2) being a public official or person selected to be a public official, directly or indirectly, corruptly demands, seeks, receives, accepts, or agrees to receive or accept anything of value personally or for any other person or entity, in return for:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-6\">(C) being induced to do or omit any act in violation of the official duty of such official or person.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-10\">shall be fined under this title or not more than three times the monetary equivalent of the thing of value, whichever is greater, or imprisoned for not more than fifteen years, or both, and may be disqualified from holding any office of honor, trust, or profit under the United States.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b410-11\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b412-7\">.
