(\u201cAirprint\u201d), her former employer, alleging violations of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 621 <em>et seq. </em>(\u201cADEA\u201d), and the Florida Civil Rights Act of 1992, Fla. Stat. Ch. 760 (\u201cFCRA\u201d). The district court dismissed Sosa\u2019s case for lack of subject matter jurisdiction because Airprint had too few employees to be subject to the provisions of the ADEA and FCRA. Sosa does not challenge that ruling, but instead appeals the district court\u2019s denial of her motion to amend the complaint to add Viking Industries, Inc. as a second defendant.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The motion to amend argued that Viking Industries and Airprint were so closely integrated that they could be considered a single employer and that the two companies together employed more than the jurisdictional minimum number of employees. Noting that Sosa\u2019s motion to amend was filed well after the time prescribed by the court\u2019s scheduling order, the district court denied the motion as untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b1502-13\">District courts are required to \u201center a scheduling order that limits the time to ... join other parties and to amend the pleadings ...\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 16(b). Such orders \u201ccontrol the subsequent course of the action unless modified by a subsequent order,\u201d Fed. R.Civ.P. 16(e), and may be modified only \u201cupon a showing of good cause.\u201d Fed. R.Civ.P. 16(b). This good cause standard precludes modification unless the schedule cannot \u201cbe met despite the diligence of the party seeking the extension.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 16 advisory committee\u2019s note; <em>see also Johnson v. Mammoth Recreations, Inc., </em>975 F.2d 604, 609 (9th Cir.1992) (\u201cIf [a] party was not diligent, the [good cause] inquiry should end.\u201d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1502-14\">A district court\u2019s decision to enforce its pre-trial order will not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion. <em>Santiago v. Lykes Bros. Steamship Co., </em>986 F.2d 423, 427 (11th Cir.1993). Because our review of the record reveals that Sosa failed to demonstrate good cause for belatedly amending her complaint, we find that the district court did not abuse its discretion and thus affirm the decision below.</p>\n<p id=\"b1503-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1419\">*1419</page-number>The record makes clear that Sosa\u2019s failure to comply with the court\u2019s scheduling order resulted from a lack of diligence in pursuing her claim. First, despite Sosa\u2019s counsel\u2019s asserted familiarity and experience with the employee numerosity requirement under the ADEA and FCRA, counsel failed to ascertain the number of Airprint\u2019s employees before filing suit and took no steps to acquire this information early in the discovery period. Even in the face of Airprint\u2019s assertion in its answer that it \u201cno longer has any employees,\u201d R.6-3, counsel waited some four months before propounding written discovery and took no oral depositions until nearly three months after the deadline for amending the complaint. Counsel thus left to chance a critical component of subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1503-4\">Second, the information supporting the proposed amendment to the complaint was available to Sosa even before she filed suit. Sosa\u2019s affidavit, filed with the district court in conjunction with her motion for leave to amend, indicates that she had been aware of the existence of Viking Industries since she began working for Airprint. Also, much of the evidence cited by counsel in support of the motion-e.p., that Airprint and Viking Industries had a common principal address, CEO, President, Secretary, and Treasurer-was public information obtained from the Florida Department of State and was readily accessible to Sosa prior to initiating her action against Airprint.</p>\n<p id=\"b1503-5\">Third, Airprint informed Sosa via interrogatory responses that it had not employed more than 20 employees during the relevant time period and that it was not an employer \u25a0within the meaning of the ADEA or the FCRA. Despite receiving this information two weeks prior to the deadline for amending her complaint, Sosa waited approximately six months before taking steps to preserve her ability to assert a viable theory of subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1503-6\">Sosa\u2019s brief on appeal does not address good cause under Rule 16(b), but focuses instead upon the liberal amendment standard set out in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(a). If Sosa\u2019s motion for leave to amend had been filed within the time prescribed by the scheduling order, Rule 15(a) would be our primary focus, as well. However, because Sosa\u2019s motion to amend was filed after the scheduling order\u2019s deadline, she must first demonstrate good cause under Rule 16(b) before we will consider whether amendment is proper under Rule 15(a). <em>Johnson, </em>975 F.2d at 607-08; <em>Anda, </em>959 F.2d at 1155. If we considered only Rule 15(a) without regard to Rule 16(b), we would render scheduling orders meaningless and effectively would read Rule 16(b) and its- good cause requirement out of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b1503-8\">In light of Sosa\u2019s lack of diligence in protecting her rights, Sosa\u2019s attempt to add a defendant outside the time frame prescribed by the scheduling order was not supported by good cause. The district court thus did not abuse its. discretion by denying as untimely Sosa\u2019s motion for leave to amend her complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b1503-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1502-10\">. Initially, Sosa also sought review of the trial court's denial of her motion for relief pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b)(3). Because counsel for the parties now agree that we do not have jurisdiction to review the trial court's disposition of that motion, we do not address the merits of that issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1502-11\">. In her motion for leave to amend, Sosa asked the district court to apply the \"excusable neglect\u201d standard found in Fed.R.Civ.P. 6(b). As we explain below, when a motion to amend is filed after a scheduling order deadline, Rule 16 is the proper guide for determining whether a party\u2019s delay may be excused. <em>See Johnson, </em>975 F.2d at 609; <em>Anda v. Ralston Purina, Co., </em>959 F.2d 1149, 1155 (1st Cir.1992). However, even if we assume, <em>arguendo, </em>that excusable neglect under Rule 6(b) were the proper standard, we would affirm the district court\u2019s decision in this case. Given the length of Sosa\u2019s delay and the fact that it was within her control to name Viking Industries as a defendant well in advance of the scheduling order\u2019s deadline, the district court was authorized to conclude that Sosa's neglect was not excusable. <em>See Pioneer Inv. Servs. Co. v. Brunswick Assocs. Ltd. Partnership, </em>507 U.S. 380, 395, 113 S.Ct. 1489, 1498, 123 L.Ed.2d 74 (1993) (relevant factors in evaluating excusable neglect include the length of the delay and whether the delay was within control of the movant).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
