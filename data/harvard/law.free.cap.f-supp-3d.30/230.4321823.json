FORREST, District Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b280-7\">An accounting firm\u2019s worst nightmare might be to wake up one morning and discover that the company that one of its teams had audited for the past several years had in fact disappeared, and that what the team had been auditing had been merely a mirage. A twist that could serve only to heighten this distress might be the discovery that the company had been stolen a few years prior \u2014 its operations and related revenues transferred away \u2014 but that the engagement team had not discovered this fact. The team had issued a \u201cclean opinion.\u201d The accounting error in such a case would be fundamental: all aspects of the financial position of the company-would have been entirely misstated, because the . operations on which it was based were long gone. This scenario is not the storyline for an auditor\u2019s version of a horror film; it is what happened here.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-8\">Until April 2011, Puda Coal Inc.\u2019s (\u201cPuda\u201d) shareholders believed there was value in the securities they held \u2014 that Puda continued to own 90% of Shanxi Puda Coal Group Co., Ltd. (\u201cShanxi Coal\u201d), a supplier of premium high-grade metallurgical coking coal used in steel manufacturing. However, in September 2009, Puda\u2019s chairman, Ming Zhao (\u201cM. Zhao\u201d), and his brother, Yao Zhao (\u201cY. Zhao\u201d), had arranged to transfer Puda\u2019s entire interest in Shanxi Coal to M. Zhao personally. This transfer left Puda as a shell company, lacking any operations or other source of revenue. The transfer was reflected in minutes of a shareholder meeting for Shanxi Coal and in documents filed in the Shanxi office of China\u2019s State Administration of Industry and Commerce (\u201cSAIC\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b280-11\">Moore Stephens Hong Kong (\u201cMSHK\u201d) audited Puda throughout the class period, and Moore Stephens, P.C. (\u201cMSPC\u201d) performed an \u201cAppendix K\u201d review. (The Court refers to MSHK and MSPC together as \u201cthe Auditors.\u201d) Puda made periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d), which incorporated audit opinions on its financial statements. Puda also discussed its financial statements in press releases.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-12\">In April 2011, the game was up. On April 8, 2011, a research report published by Alfred Little (the \u201cLittle Report\u201d) disclosed \u2019the Zhao brothers\u2019 transfer of Shanxi Coal. Puda\u2019s shares declined 34%; one trading day later, the SEC halted trading of Puda\u2019s shares entirely. The first of many lawsuits was filed on April 15, 2011. (ECF No. 1.) A number of lawsuits were filed thereafter- and consolidated. Following motion practice and discovery, a Second Consolidated and Supplemental Amended Complaint (\u201cSCAC\u201d) was filed on April 21, 2014. (ECF No. 352.)</p>\n<p id=\"b280-13\">The SCAC alleges violations of the securities laws against a variety' of individuals and entities, including Puda\u2019s Auditors.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>Plaintiffs bring claims against the Auditors pursuant to Section 11 of the Securities Act of 1983 (Count I) and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder (Count IV).</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">Pending before the Court are eight intertwined motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">On February 14, 2014, the Auditor defendants both moved for summary judgment as to all claims against them on the basis that plaintiffs have failed to raise triable issues as to the subjective falsity of the alleged misstatements as well as to scienter, and, in the case of MSPC, on the basis that it was not the \u201cmaker\u201d of any of the alleged misstatements. On February 14, 2014, MSHK also moved to exclude plaintiffs\u2019 sole proposed auditing expert, Anita C.M. Hou, on the basis that she lacks the expertise to opine on any issues of relevance and that th\u00e9 opinions she does offer are irrelevant to any issue in the case. MSPC joined that motion. (ECF Nos. 297, 298.) Those motions became fully briefed on May 7, 2014.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">In addition to her expert report, Hou also submitted two declarations in opposition to the Auditors\u2019 motions for summary judgment on March 28, 2014. On May 7, 2014,\u2019 MSHK moved to strike these declarations, and MSP.C joined that motion. (ECF No. 364.) That motion became fully briefed on June 6, 2014.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-8\">On March 28, 2014, plaintiffs moved to exclude the Auditors\u2019 three proposed experts: Alexander H. Mackintosh and Peter S. Nurczynski on the basis that their reports are procedurally inappropriate casein-chief reports masquerading as \u201crebuttal\u201d reports, and Wang Weimin, on the basis that he lacks necessary expertise and his opinions are merely <em>ipse dixit. </em>Those motions became fully briefed on May 28, 2014.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-11\">Finally, plaintiffs have moved to strike MSHK\u2019s reply in support of its Local Civil Rule 56.1 statement of material facts. Defendants opposed this motion on June 6, 2014.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-12\">For the reasons set forth below, the Auditors\u2019 motions for summary judgment and to exclude Hou and strike her declarations are GRANTED. While essentially rendered moot, plaintiffs\u2019 motions regarding Nurczynski, Mackintosh and Weimin are DENIED. Plaintiffs\u2019 motion to strike MSHK\u2019s reply is also DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-13\">I. FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b281-14\">The following facts are undisputed unless otherwise noted.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-15\">Puda was incorporated in 2001. (Def. MSHK\u2019s Resp. to Pis.\u2019 Separate Stmt, of Add\u2019l Material Facts (\u201cMSHK 56.1 Resp.\u201d) \u00b6 1.) In 2005, through a reverse merger, Puda acquired a 100% interest in Puda Investment Holding Limited (\u201cBVI\u201d), which in turn owned 100% of Shanxi Putai Resources Ltd. (\u201cPutai\u201d). <em>(Id. </em>\u00b62.) Puda conducted its operations exclusively through Shanxi Coal, a PRC limited-liability company. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 3.) In November 2007, Putai became a 90% owner of Shanxi Coal, with the remaining 10% held by M. Zhao and Y. Zhao. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 5; [Corrected] Pis.\u2019 Resp. to Def. MSHK\u2019s Stmt, of Material Facts (\u201cPis.\u2019 56.1 Resp.\u201d) \u00b6 10.) As of December 31, 2009, M. Zhao and Y. Zhao <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>owned 60% of Puda and the 10% of Shanxi not owned by Putai. (MSHK 56.1 Resp. \u00b6 6.) M. Zhao was the chairman of the boards of Puda and Shanxi Coal in 2009 and 2010; he was also identified as a legal representative on Shanxi Coal\u2019s 2009 business license. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 7.) Y. Zhao was identified as the legal representative of Shanxi Putai Minerals Co. (also \u201cPutai\u201d) on its 2011 business license. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 8.) PRC regulations designated the Zhao brothers, as the registered legal representatives of Shanxi Coal and Putai, as the \u201cresponsible person who acts on behalf of the [entity], in exercising its functions and powers ... in accordance with the law or the articles of association.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 9.) The Zhao brothers\u2019 roles as \u201clegal representatives\u201d were necessary to make the subsequent fraudulent transfers. <em>(Id.) </em>In December 2009, Puda\u2019s board of directors approved a change in Puda\u2019s business strategy, expanding its focus from solely a coal-washing business to include mining. (Pis.\u2019 56.1 Resp. \u00b6 11.)</p>\n<p id=\"b282-4\">According to the findings of Puda\u2019s Audit Committee released in September 2011, in September 2009, M. Zhao \u201carranged for Shanxi Putai Resources Limited (\u2018Putai\u2019), another subsidiary of [Puda] and the parent company of Shanxi Coal, to transfer its 90% ownership (and thereby [Puda\u2019s] indirect 90% ownership) of Shanxi Coal to himself.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 15, 16.) The Audit Committee also found that Y. Zhao, M. Zhao\u2019s brother, who was the legal representative of Putai, had \u201cauthorized the transfer.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 16.) Y. Zhao also transferred a personal 2% ownership interest that he had in Shanxi Coal to his brother, resulting in M. Zhao having a 99% ownership interest. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 16, 17.) The Audit Committee also found that \u201cLiping Zhu, the Company\u2019s CEO, President and director on the Board, was aware of the 90% Transfer but did not disclose it to any other director.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 18.)</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">In July 2010, now owning 99% of Shanxi Coal, M. Zhao \u201csigned various documents to further transfer 49% of the ownership of Shanxi Coal to CITIC,\u201d a state-owned private equity fund in the People\u2019s Republic of China (\u201cPRC\u201d). <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 17, 19.) Also in July 2010, M. Zhao and Wei Zhang (a Shanxi Coal employee who owned the remaining 1% of Shanxi Coal), together pledged \u2014 but did not transfer \u2014 their remaining 51% ownership of Shanxi Coal to CITIC. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 20.)</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">The transfer of Putai\u2019s interest in Shanxi Coal to M. Zhao, M. Zhao\u2019s subsequent transfer of 49% of his interest to CITIC, and the 51% pledge by M. Zhao and Wei to CITIC were not disclosed in Puda\u2019s 2009 or 2010 financial statements at the time that they were filed with the SEC; those statements indicated that Puda still maintained an indirect 90% interest of Shanxi. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 22.) Because Puda had no indirect or direct interest in the operations or revenues of Shanxi Coal as of September 2009, but disclosed in its financial statements that it did, its financial statements for those periods were materially misstated and not prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (\u201cU.S. GAAP\u201d). <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 23.)</p>\n<p id=\"b282-7\">On April 8, 2011, Alfred Little published a short seller report disclosing the Zhao transfers of Shanxi Coal away from Putai and Puda. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 15.) On July 7, 2011, the Auditors resigned. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 29.)</p>\n<p id=\"b282-8\">Puda\u2019s financial statements contained in its Form 10-Ks for the years 2009 and '2010 included all of the assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, and net income for Shanxi Coal. (MSHK 56.1 Resp. \u00b6 14.) Puda\u2019s 2009 annual report disclosed that Shanxi Coal had over $200 million in revenue for the year. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 13.).</p>\n<p id=\"b283-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>The SAIC administers the registration of enterprises, entities, and individuals engaged in business operations in China. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 15.) The SAIC issues business licenses for PRC companies. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 17.) A business license includes information relating to, <em>inter alia, </em>the name and address of the company and its legal representative, the type and scope of its business, and the amount of registered or paid-in capital. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 17.) A business license typically does not show the identity or ownership interest of particular shareholders. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 18.) Chinese law requires that such information be contained in the company\u2019s \u201carticles of association.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 19.) Chinese law also requires that a company\u2019s transfer of equity must amend the names of shareholders and their capital contributions in its articles of association. <em>(Id.) </em>As of 1983, SAIC required that all companies operating with a PRC business license undergo annual inspections. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 16.)</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">When a company first registers with the SAIC, the company files a form with the SAIC disclosing the names of its shareholders, the amounts of their contribution, and the total registered capital. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 22.) If the company\u2019s shares are transferred or the amount of registered shares is altered, the company must notify the SAIC and apply for approval of the changes. <em>(Id.) </em>The SAIC issues the company a new business license if and when such changes are approved. <em>(Id.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">When shareholders makes a capital contribution, a PRC-certified public accountant must issue a \u201ccapital verification report\u201d (\u201cCVR\u201d); when a company registers or changes'its capital, it must file a CVR with the SAIC. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 21.) However, if only the identity or percentage of ownership of shareholders changes, and the total amount of contributed capital remains unchanged, then the company is not required to file the CVR with the SAIC. <em>(Id.) </em>A CVR is typically valid for 90 days from the date of issue. <em>(Id.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b283-8\">\n<em>A. Audit Standards</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b283-9\">MSHK conducted its audit of Puda pursuant to Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (\u201cPCAOB\u201d) audit standards. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 24.) MSHK used a Thompson Reuters Practitioner\u2019s Publishing Company Guide to PCAOB Audits (\u201cPPC Guide\u201d), as the basis for preparing its work papers and conducting audits of Puda. (Pis.\u2019 56.1 Resp. \u00b6 60.) As a non-U.S. firm, Moore Stephens is required to have \u201cAppendix K\u201d review procedures performed on its audits of U.S.-registered companies; senior auditors from MSPC based in the U.S. performed that function. <em>(See id. </em>\u00b6 73; Decl.. of Brian J. Massengill (\u201cMassengill Decl.\u201d) Ex. 2 (Expert Report of Alexander H. Mackintosh (\u201cMackintosh Rep.\u201d)), at 4, 11, 12.) PCAOB audit standards require that MSHK obtain \u201creasonable assurance,\u201d defined as a \u201chigh level\u201d of assurance, to support its audit conclusions. (MSHK 56.1 Resp. \u00b6\u00b6 30, 31.)</p>\n<p id=\"ATO\">MSHK\u2019s 2009 and 2010 audits of Puda\u2019s financial statements were combined with audits of its internal controls. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 24.) The MSHK partners and principals on the MSHK engagement team for both the 2009 and 2010 year-end audits had experience auditing both PRC and US-listed companies, and assessing and testing internal controls. (Pis.\u2019 56.1 Resp. \u00b6 51.) They also had experience issuing audit reports in accordance with PCAOB standards. <em>(Id.) </em>The partners and principals on the audits were each multilingual in Cantonese, Mandarin, and English. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 52.) The MSHK audit engagement team for Puda also had access to and used U.S. technical resources in conducting its audit work, specifically with regard to U.S. GAAP and PCAOB standards. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 61.)</p>\n<p id=\"b284-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>MSPC conducted an Appendix K review relating to Puda and issued MSHK a clearance letter stating that based on its review of, <em>inter alia, </em>the financial statements and MSHK\u2019s work papers, the financial statements were prepared in accordance with GAAP and the PCAOB standards. <em>(Id.) </em>MSPC did not provide an audit opinion to Puda directly, nor was any audit opinion included directly in any of Puda\u2019s financial statements; MSPC was not a signatory on the audit opinion letter provided by MSHK to Puda and incorporated into its Form 10-K.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-4\">MSHK personnel spent substantial time at Shanxi Coal in connection with their work. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 63.) In connection with the 2009 and 2010 year-end audits, four or five MSHK auditors each spent approximately a month each year at Shanxi Coal\u2019s facilities and corporate headquarters in Shanxi Province conducting fieldwork. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 65.) As part of their work, the team inspected physical assets and took photographs as audit evidence. <em>(Id.) </em>Puda\u2019s controller, Irene Cheong, interacted regularly with the MSHK audit team. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 66, 67.) The chairman of Puda\u2019s Audit Committee testified that he was \u201cvery impressed\u201d with the quality of MSHK\u2019s work. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 69.)</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">B. <em>The 2009 Audit</em></p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">At the outset of its 2009 audit of Puda, MSHK completed a \u201cFraud Risk Identification Form.\u201d (MSHK 56.1 Resp. \u00b6 27.) In its \u201cInformation Gathered\u201d section, the form states that \u201cmanagement is dominated by [a] single individual,\u201d and that there is a \u201cPotential Fraud Risk\u201d of \u201cManagement override of controls.\u201d <em>(Id.) </em>The form also sets forth the procedures that MSHK must perform in order to address the risk of \u201cmanagement override of controls\u201d on a page designated as \u201cPCA-AP-2.\u201d <em>(Id.) </em>These procedures include \u201cexamining] journal entries and other adjustments for evidence of possible material misstatement due to fraud,\u201d \u201creviewfing] accounting estimates for bias that could result in material misstatements due to fraud,\u201d and \u201cevaluating] the business rationale for significant unusual transactions.\u201d <em>(Id.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b284-9\">In its 2009 audit,, MSHK performed the following procedures to confirm that Putai owned 90% of Shanxi Coal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-10\">a. Reviewed a management representation letter from Puda;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-11\">b. Reviewed an unsigned \u201cform\u201d of a legal opinion from PRC counsel in connection with a February 2010 public offering;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-12\">c.

Section V contained an \u201cAudit Program for Capital Stock and Other Equity Accounts.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 33.) The first item in this audit program required MSHK to review Puda\u2019s board minutes and note any equity transactions that had been authorized. <em>(Id.) </em>In its work papers, MSHK noted, \u201cNo meeting between directors was held in the current year. No equity transaction was noted in the current year.\u201d <em>(Id.) </em>The second audit procedure in Section V concerned transactions in equity accounts and required MSHK to \u201c[cjompare the balances with those of the prior years or other expectations, considering known changes in client operations and equity financing activity.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 34.) In its work papers, MSHK noted that it performed the comparison <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>and that \u201cno change was noted.\u201d <em>(Id.) </em>The third audit procedure required in Section V was that MSHK \u201c[t]est significant transactions affecting paid-in capital, contributed capital, or treasury stock.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 35.) Work papers VIO, V12, and V13 reflect steps that MSHK performed in this regard. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 36.) V10 contains a breakdown of the registered capital of Shanxi Coal and the names of corresponding shareholders. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 37.) MSHK noted on this work paper that \u201cno movement was noted in the current year.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 38.)</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">Work paper X20/1 is an unsigned September 25, 2008 Shanxi Coal shareholder meeting resolution that states, \u201cThis unsigned minute is attached as it is [sic ] only served as reference purpose since the minute was issued in year 2008 and audited in prior year\u2019s audit.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>1142.) The unsigned shareholder resolution also referred to a shareholder dividend to be paid. <em>(Id.) </em>As of March 31, 2009, this dividend had not been paid. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 44.) Puda\u2019s 2009 and 2010 Form 10-Ks disclosed that the dividend had not been paid and that \u201cthe Zhao brothers may declare dividend out of Shanxi Coal.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 44, 45.)</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">Section Z of MSHK\u2019s working papers focused on the consolidation of subsidiaries. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 46.) Item 4 of the Section Z audit program states that MSHK should \u201c[cjonflrm that all group undertakings have been identified for inclusion in the consolidation with the extent and form of the group\u2019s interest in each undertaking noted. Ensure that all undertakings are noted on the group structure Z/8.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 47.) Ida Law, a member of MSHK\u2019s engagement team who led the audit for year-end 2010, testified that this \u201cItem 4\u201d step was intended to confirm that Puda owned 90% of Shanxi Coal. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 48; <em>see also </em>Pis.\u2019 56.1 Resp. \u00b6 56.) When asked during a deposition question what steps MSHK took to check whether Shanxi Coal was still a subsidiary, Law testified, \u201cWe ... already inquired management if there \u2014 there are any changes in \u2014 in the group structure. And they \u2014 their answer is \u2014 was no change.\u201d (MSHK 56.1 Resp. \u00b6 50.)</p>\n<p id=\"b285-12\">As part of its audit procedures, MSHK obtained a copy of Shanxi Coal\u2019s business license. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 51.) MSHK intended to obtain a copy of the 2009 business license, but Puda\u2019s CFO, Laby Wu, instead emailed a copy of a business license that had been issued in September 2007. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 52.) That license contained an inspection stamp from the SAIC dated March 27, 2009. <em>(Id.) </em>On its face, the business license states, \u201cThe enterprise must participate in the annual inspection between March 1 and June 30 of each year.\u201d <em>(Id.) </em>Laby Wu sent MSHK the license on February 10, 2010, prior to the time that the SAIC would have received its next annual inspection. <em>(Id.) </em>No other business license for Shanxi Coal is in the record on this motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-13\">Goodwin Procter LLP, counsel for certain Puda directors whom plaintiffs have sued in this consolidated lawsuit, produced a Shanxi Coal business license issued on September 9, 2009, showing that the registered capital had increased from 22.5 million RMB to 100 million RMB. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 53.)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b285-14\">As part of its 2009 audit, MSHK obtained an unsigned draft \u201cform\u201d of a legal opinion from Puda\u2019s PRC counsel that, according to Mackintosh, corroborated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>that there had been no change in the company\u2019s capital structure in 2009. <em>{Id. </em>\u00b6 57.)</p>\n<p id=\"b286-4\">Section W of MSHK\u2019s work papers contains an audit procedure to identify related party transactions. <em>{Id. </em>\u00b6 58.) To perform this step, MSHK was required to review minutes from Shanxi Coal\u2019s board and shareholder meetings. <em>{Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 58, 59.) MSHK requested but did not receive such minutes and was told that no such minutes existed. <em>{Id. </em>\u00b6 60.) Cheong, Puda\u2019s controller, testified that MSHK requested minutes of Shanxi Coal\u2019s board and shareholder meetings each quarter. <em>{Id. </em>\u00b6 64.) MSHK\u2019s audit program contains additional steps to identify related party transactions including \u201c[rjeview documents in the permanent file, income tax returns, SEC filings (including proxy materials and Forms 8-K), other regulatory filings, and current year minutes for possible related parties and related-party transactions.\u201d <em>{Id. </em>\u00b6 74.)</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">MSHK did not obtain Shanxi Coal\u2019s filings from the SAIC for in connection with its 2009 audit. <em>{Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 75, 81.) Law testified that it is possible to hire an agent to obtain filings from the SAIC and that she had performed \u201ccompany search[es]\u201d on occasion in circumstances that warranted such searches. <em>{Id. </em>\u00b6 76.) Law testified that she did not believe that the 2009 audit of Puda presented circumstances requiring such a step. <em>{Id. </em>\u00b6 77.)</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">The corporate rules governing Shanxi Coal\u2019s operations, its Memorandum and Articles (\u201cM <em>&amp; </em>A\u201d), provide that Shanxi Coal should hold shareholder meetings every quarter. <em>{Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 65, 66.) MSHK was aware that Shanxi Coal entered into several significant shareholder transactions during 2009. <em>{Id. </em>\u00b6 67.) MSHK\u2019s 2009 Audit Planning Memorandum noted that one of the transactions into which it had entered (an acquisition of 18% of Shanxi Jianhe Coal Limited), as well as Shanxi Coal\u2019s appointment as a \u201ccoal mine consolidator,\u201d presented significant accounting and auditing issues. <em>{Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 67, 70.)

Its audit opinion, included in Puda\u2019s Form 10-K, stated, \u201cWe conducted our audits in connection with the standards of the [PCAOB] (United States) ]....

It did not obtain Shanxi Coal\u2019s SAIC filings in connection with its 2010 audit. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 81.)</p>\n<p id=\"b286-14\">MSHK received a CVR dated May 17, 2010, that reflected an infusion of capital into Shanxi Coal by Putai and M.

MSHK also received a business license for Shanxi Coal that had been issued on May 26, 2010. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 84.) The May 2010 CVR, like the one that MSHK had received in connection with the 2009 audit, stated that it was valid for 90 days from its date of issuance. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 86.) The CVR also listed the purported shareholders and their ownership interests in Shanxi Coal. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 88.)</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">The CVR contained the company and personal \u201cchops\u201d \u2014 a PRC equivalent to a signature \u2014 of the PRC public accountants who had issued the CVR. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 89.)

(MSHK 56.1 Resp. \u00b6 92.) Shanxi Coal\u2019s 2007 business license, on which MSHK relied in connection with its 2009 Audit, indicates that Shanxi Coal was a \u201climited liability company.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 93.) Its 2010 business license contains different language and indicates that Shanxi Coal is a \u201climited liability company (stock controlled by natural person or private enterprise).\u201d <em>(Id.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b287-7\">MSHK relied on the form of legal opinion that was required to be issued to the underwriter in connection with Puda\u2019s public offering that closed in December 2010. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 94.)</p>\n<p id=\"b287-8\">MSHK provided a clean audit opinion in connection with its 2010 audit of Puda. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 99.) Its opinion stated that the financial statements in Puda\u2019s Form 10-K \u201cpresent fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Puda Coal, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2010 and 2009 ... in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States . of America.\u201d <em>(Id.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b287-10\">Plaintiffs assert that the Auditors\u2019 reports were false and misleading because (1) Moore Stephens did not conduct its audits in accordance with PCAOB standards; (2) Puda\u2019s financial statements did not present fairly its financial position; (3) Puda did not present its financial statements in accordance with GAAP; and (4) Puda\u2019s internal controls were not effective but were instead plagued by significant material weaknesses. (SCAC \u00b6 96.) MSHK\u2019s 2009 and 2010 audit reports both stated that MSHK conducted its audits of Puda\u2019s financial statements and internal controls \u201cin accordance with the standards of the [PCAOB] (United States).\u201d (Pis.\u2019 56.1 Resp. \u00b6 28.)</p>\n<p id=\"b287-11\">D. <em>The Auditors\u2019Resignation</em></p>\n<p id=\"b287-12\">On July 14, 2011, Puda filed a Form 8-K with the SEC announcing that MSHK had resigned as Puda\u2019s auditor. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 100.) In a letter attached to that Form 8-K, MSHK announced that its 2009 and 2010 audit opinions could no longer be relied upon. <em>(Id.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b287-13\">E. <em>Anita C.M.

Hou states that her \u201copinions on the audit processes and procedures are focused on those generally applicable in auditing companies in the PRC/Hong Kong, referencing relevant auditing standards adopted/promulgated by Ministry of Finance in the PRC and Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 2.13.)

She does not offer an opinion as to whether the 2009 and 2010 Audits complied with PCAOB standards. (Pis.\u2019 56.1 Resp. \u00b6 7.) Hou testified at her deposition that she was not and is not \u201cqualified to serve as an engagement partner on an audit of a U.S. registered company conducted in accordance with PCAOB standards.\u201d (MSHK 56.1 Resp. \u00b6 103; Pis.\u2019 56.1 Resp. \u00b6 224.) She also testified that she is \u201cnot qualified to issue any opinion on PCAOB standards\u201d; when plaintiffs\u2019 counsel asked her whether she could opine as to \u201cwhether the audits were conducted in accordance with PCAOB standards,\u201d she responded that she \u201chad no experience in looking at PCAOB engagement^]\u201d and therefore could not provide an opinion on that topic.

Mackintosh has been a U.S. Certified Public Accountant (\u201cCPA\u201d) since 1979. <em>(Id., </em>\u00b6 70.) He began work at the accounting firm Ernst &amp; Young LLP (\u201cE &amp; Y\u201d) in 1978 and was promoted to partner in 1988. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 71.) In 1997, Mackintosh transferred to E &amp; Y\u2019s office in Hong Kong, where he remained until his retirement in 2011. <em>(Id.) </em>Mackintosh has experience with PCAOB standards. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 74.) After transferring to Hong Kong, he was involved in Schedule K reviews for U.S. registrants. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 73.)</p>\n<p id=\"b288-12\">Mackintosh has submitted an expert declaration in this case; plaintiffs deposed him on January 30, 2014. <em>(See generally </em>Rosen Decl. Ex. 10 (Mackintosh Dep.); Mackintosh Rep.) In his declaration, he has offered a variety of opinions regarding what PCAOB standards require and whether the Auditors\u2019 work for Puda met those standards. In all respects, he opines that the Auditors\u2019 work complied with PCAOB standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-13\">Mackintosh opines, \u201cPCAOB standards do not require that the auditor perform procedures that address every account in the financial statements, test every transaction or address every potential or theoretical way that accounts and financial statements may be misstated.\u201d (Pis.\u2019 56.1 Resp. \u00b6 80.) He also opines that MSHK planned both the 2009 and 2010 engagements in accordance with PCAOB stan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>dards and that the planning was sufficient to address the risks identified in Puda\u2019s audit, including inherent and fraud risk. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 144.) Mackintosh also opines that \u201cthe planning procedures were appropriately supervised and approved by the senior members of the [ ] engagement team,\u201d that MSHK\u2019s \u201cassessment of significant business processes was in accordance with PCAOB standards,\u201d and that the MSHK\u2019s \u201cprocedures and conclusions relating to entity-level controls were in accordance with PCAOB Standards.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b682, 97, 98.)</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">Mackintosh has opined that MSHK\u2019s \u201cprocedures and conclusions related to related parties were in accordance with PCAOB Standards,\u201d and that \u201cit was not necessary or required under PCAOB standards that [MSHK] attempt to obtain independent confirmations from the SAIG as part of its 2010 audit procedures.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 173,190.)</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">G. <em>Peter S.

He performed Appendix K reviews during that time. <em>(Id. </em>at 4.) He also provides background on the relevant SEC regulations and professional standards regarding Appendix K reviews, as well as his opinion as to how an auditor appropriately complies with such requirements. <em>(See generally id.) </em>For example, he states, \u201cAppendix K does not require the Filing Reviewer to perform audit steps, to review audit work papers, or to interact with the audit client. Accordingly, in order to complete a filing review, a Filing Reviewer necessarily relies on the work performed by the engagement team and the expertise of the engagement team.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 14.)</p>\n<p id=\"b289-10\">In his report, Nurczynski opines, \u201cMSPC appropriately performed its Appendix K or Filing Review on behalf of MSHK with respect to Puda\u2019s 2009 and 2010 Form 10-k filings with the SEC.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 20.)</p>\n<p id=\"b289-11\">H. <em>Wang Weimin</em></p>\n<p id=\"b289-12\">MSHK has proffered Wang Weimin as an expert in PRC law. He is a lawyer who practices in the PRC and represents companies engaging in mergers, acquisitions and business transactions. (Massengill Decl. Ex. 3 (Expert Report of Wang Wei-min (\u201cWeimin Rep.\u201d)), at 1.) In connection with his work, he has conducted due diligence on target companies in the PRC; he is familiar with, <em>inter alia, </em>filing requirements in the PRC and the significance of the CVR. <em>(Id. </em>at 1, 2, 5-6.)</p>\n<p id=\"b289-13\">In his report, Weimin states that local SAIC offices maintain documents with differing degrees of consistency and that some \u201cregistration documents\u201d and other filings are not available to the public. <em>(Id. </em>at 4.) He opines that searches of the SAIC\u2019s local offices often result in incomplete information. <em>(Id. </em>at 8.) Weimin also states that he has reviewed a CVR in this case and confirms what the CVR states on its face. <em>(Id. </em>at 6.) Weimin further discusses Shanxi\u2019s September 13, 2007 business license, and states that it was \u201ceffective until the next annual inspection in 2010 or the occurrence of an event necessitating the change of any essential information in the business license, unless other events calling for retraction of the business license were to occur.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 7.) Finally, Weimin is familiar with shareholder regis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>ters that PRC regulations require companies to maintain.

Catrett, </em>477 U.S. 317, 323, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986). On summary judgment, the Court must \u201cconstrue all evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, drawing all inferences and resolving all ambiguities in its favor.\u201d <em>Dickerson v.

A \u201cparty may not rely on mere speculation or conjecture as to the true nature of the facts to overcome a motion for summary judgment,\u201d because \u201c[mjere conclusory allegations or denials ... cannot by themselves create a genuine issue of material fact where none would otherwise exist.\u201d <em>Hicks v.

The Court should not accept evidence presented by the nonmoving party that is so \u201cblatantly contradicted by the record ... that no reasonable jury could believe it.\u201d <em>Scott v.

This is consistent with the general principle that violations of GAAP or Generally Accepted Auditing Standards (\u201cGAAS\u201d) without a corresponding fraudulent intent are insufficient to establish securities fraud, or even to state a claim. <em>See Chill, </em>101 F.3d at 270; <em>In re Worlds of Wonder, </em>35 F.3d at 1426 (explaining that even deliberate violations of GAAP and GAAS, without more, do not amount to fraud); <em>accord Marksman Partners, L.P. v.

Bilzerian, </em>926 F.2d 1285, 1294 (2d Cir.1991). A trial court has an obligation, however, to act as a gatekeeper with respect to expert testimony. <em>See Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharms., Inc., </em>509 U.S. 579, 597, 113 S.Ct. 2786, 125 L.Ed.2d 469 (1993); <em>see also Major League Baseball Props., Inc. v. Salvino, Inc., </em>542 F.3d 290, 311 (2d Cir.2008). This is due in large part to the fact that an expert is \u201cpermitted wide latitude to offer opinions,' including those that are not based on firsthand knowledge or observation.\u201d <em>Daubert, </em>509 U.S. at 592, 113 S.Ct. 2786. The court\u2019s role as a gatekeeper is therefore necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-9\">\u201cThe primary locus of this obligation is [Federal Rule of Evidence] 702, which clearly contemplates some degree of regulation of the subjects and theories about which an expert may testify.\u201d <em>Daubert, </em>509 U.S. at 589, 113 S.Ct. 2786. Rule 702 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-10\">A witness who is qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill; experience, training, or education may testify in the form of an opinion or otherwise if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-11\">(a) the expert\u2019s scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge will help the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-12\">(b) the testimony is based on sufficient facts or data;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-13\">(c) the testimony is the product of reliable principles and methods; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-14\">(d) the expert has reliably applied the principles and methods to the facts of the case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AqB\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>FecLR.Evid. 702. Thus, this Court\u2019s inquiry into whether an expert meets Rule 702\u2019s requirements includes a review of (1) the qualifications of the proposed expert; (2) whether each proposed opinion is based upon reliable data and reliable methodology; and (3) whether the proposed testimony would be helpful to the trier of fact. <em>See, e.g., Nimely v. City of New York, </em>414 F.3d 381, 396-97 (2d Cir.2005); <em>Arista Records LLC, et al. v. Lime Grp. LLC, et al., </em>No. 06-cv-5936 (KMW), 2011 WL 1674796, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. May 2, 2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\">The \u201coverarching subject\u201d or the Rule 702 inquiry is \u201cthe evidentiary relevance and reliability \u2014 of the principles that underlie a proposed submission. The focus, of course, must be solely on principles and methodology, not on the conclusions they generate.\u201d <em>Daubert, </em>509 U.S. at 595, 113 S.Ct. 2786.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">However, even otherwise qualified experts may not simply offer conclusory opinions. <em>Major League Baseball, </em>542 F.3d at 311; <em>Bridgeway Corp. v. Citibank, </em>201 F.3d 134, 142 (2d Cir.2000). 'Concluso-ry opinions are a form of <em>\u201cipse dixit, </em>\u201d and often provide an insufficient basis upon which to assess reliability. <em>See, e.g., Nimely, </em>414 F.3d at 396.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">Expert testimony, like all evidence, is also subject to the requirements of Rule 403, which provides that otherwise relevant evidence \u201cmay be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting Fed.R.Evid. 403). In <em>Dau-bert, </em>the Supreme Court \u201cnoted the uniquely important role that Rule 403 has to play in a district court\u2019s scrutiny of expert testimony, given the unique weight such evidence may have in a jury\u2019s deliberations.\u201d <em>See Nimely, </em>414 F.3d at 397.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-7\">1. <em>Qualifications</em></p>\n<p id=\"b294-8\">Inquiry into a proposed expert\u2019s qualifications is a threshold question that seeks to determine whether the proposed expert is, in fact, an expert at all in the area in which he or she intends to testify. <em>See Daubert, </em>509 U.S. at 592 n. 10, 113 S.Ct. 2786; <em>Arista Records, </em>2011 WL 1674796, at *2. Put simply, without the requisite qualifications, the reliability of a proposed expert\u2019s testimony is in serious doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-9\">Whether a proposed expert is qualified depends on his or her educational background, training, and experience in the field relevant to the opinions that he or she seeks to express. <em>See id.; see also United States v. Tin Yat Chin, </em>371 F.3d 31, 40 (2d Cir.2004) (\u201cTo determine whether a witness qualifies as an expert, courts compare the area in which the witness has superior knowledge, education, experience, or skill with the subject matter of the proffered testimony.\u201d); <em>Cary Oil Co., Inc. v. MG Refining &amp; Mktg., Inc., </em>No. 99-cv-1725 (VM), 2003 WL 1878246, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 11, 2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b294-10\">In the Second Circuit, courts have construed the inquiry into an expert\u2019s qualifications with an eye towards the \u201cliberal thrust\u201d of the Federal Rules and their \u201cgeneral approach of relaxing the traditional barriers to \u2018opinion\u2019 testimony.\u201d <em>See Daubert, </em>509 U.S. at 588-89, 113 S.Ct. 2786; <em>In re Rezulin Prods.

If an expert\u2019s training and experience are in a field closely related to the area to the proposed testimony, that may, in appropriate circumstances, be suf-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>f\u00edcient to meet Rule 702\u2019s qualification standards. <em>See Arista Records, </em>2011 WL 1674796, at *3; <em>Johnson &amp; Johnson Vision Care, Inc. v. CIBA Vision Corp., </em>No. 04-cv-7369 (LTS), 2006 WL 2128785, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. July 28, 2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">2. <em>Reliability</em></p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">The reliability of a proposed expert\u2019s testimony \u201centails a preliminary assessment of whether the reasoning or methodology underlying the testimony is scientifically valid and whether that reasoning or methodology properly can be applied to the facts in issue.\u201d <em>Daubert, </em>509 U.S. at 592-93, 113 S.Ct. 2786. Among the questions to be answered are whether the theory or methodology can be tested, whether it has been subjected to peer review, whether it has a potential rate of error, and whether there is \u201cgeneral acceptance\u201d of the methodology or theory. <em>Id. </em>at 593-94, 113 S.Ct. 2786.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-7\">There are, however, limitations that a court can, and indeed sometimes must, place upon even a qualified expert proposing to testify as to some admissible opinions. For instance, the court may preclude an expert from testifying as to the credibility of other witnesses or evidence. <em>See United States v. Scop, </em>846 F.2d 135, 142 (2d Cir.), <em>modified on reh\u2019g, </em>856 F.2d 5 (2d Cir.1988); <em>In re Blech Secs. Litig., </em>No. 94-cv-7696 (RWS), 2003 WL 1610775, at *21 (S.D.N.Y.

July 16, 2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b295-8\">Furthermore, an opinion that is speculative or conjectural does not satisfy Rule 702. <em>See Daubert, </em>509 U.S. at 590, 113 S.Ct. 2786 (\u201c[T]he word \u2018knowledge\u2019 connotes more than subjective belief or unsupported speculation.\u201d). Thus, proffered \u201cexpert testimony should be excluded if it is speculative or conjectural.\u201d <em>Major League Baseball, </em>542 F.3d at 311. While the <em>Daubert </em>inquiry is \u201cflexible\u201d and intended to give the Court the \u201cdiscretion needed to ensure that the courtroom door remains closed to junk science,\u201d it is also true that, to warrant admissibility, \u201cit is critical that an expert\u2019s analysis be reliable at every step.\u201d <em>Amorgianos v. Nat\u2019l R.R. Passenger Corp., </em>303 F.3d 256, 267 (2d Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b295-10\">3. <em>Helpfulness to the trier of fact</em></p>\n<p id=\"b295-11\">-Expert testimony must be helpful to, but not usurp the province of, the trier of fact. <em>Bilzerian, </em>926 F.2d at 1294; <em>Marx &amp; Co. v. Diners\u2019 Club, Inc., </em>550 F.2d 505, 512 (2d Cir.1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b295-12\">Federal Rules of Evidence 401, 402, and 403 govern the inquiry of whether an individual qualified as an expert, using reliable methodologies, is proffering testimony that is both admissible and should .be allowed. Rule 403, which provides for the exclusion of otherwise relevant evidence \u201cif its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury,\u201d is applicable to the Court\u2019s inquiry in this regard. <em>Daubert, </em>509 U.S. at 595, 113 S.Ct. 2786 (quoting Fed.R.Evid. 403).</p>\n<p id=\"b295-13\">Furthermore, expert testimony may not usurp the province of the judge to instruct on the law, or of the jury to make factual determinations. <em>See Bilzerian, </em>926 F.2d at 1294; <em>Marx &amp; Co., </em>550 F.2d at 510-11. While an expert \u201cmay opine on an issue of fact within the jury\u2019s province, he may not give testimony stating ultimate legal conclusions based on those facts.\u201d <em>Bilzerian, </em>926 F.2d at 1294. Moreover, \u201c[although testimony concerning the ordinary practices in [an] industry may be received to enable the jury to evaluate a defendant\u2019s conduct against the standards of accepted practice. <em>Marx, </em>550 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>F.2d at 509, testimony encompassing an ultimate legal conclusion based upon the facts of the case is not admiss[i]ble, and may not be made so simply because it is presented in terms of industry practice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1295.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-3\">4. \u201cRebuttal\u201d <em>Experts</em></p>\n<p id=\"b296-4\">Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26 sets forth the basic rules, which may be modified by court order, governing the disclosure of testifying, experts.

Furthermore, \u201c[u]nless otherwise stipulated or ordered by the court, this disclosure must be accompanied by a written report.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 26(a)(2)(B). \u201cA party must make these disclosures at the times and in the sequence that the court orders. Absent a stipulation or a court order, the disclosures must be made .... (ii) if the evidence is intended solely to contradict or rebut evidence on the same subject matter identified by another party under Rule 26(a)(2)(B) ..., within 30 days after the other party\u2019s disclosure.\u201d Fed. R.Civ.P. 26(a)(2)(D). In addition, the rule provides for supplementing these disclosures. Fed.R.Civ.P. 26(a)(2)(E).</p>\n<p id=\"Ahq\">Evidence can be divided into two categories: that which goes to proof of a party\u2019s case in chief, and that which responds or rebuts evidence of an adverse party. <em>See, e.g., Allen v. Prince George\u2019s County, </em>737 F.2d 1299, 1305 (4th Cir.1984) (\u201cOrdinarily, rebuttal evidence may be introduced only to counter new facts presented in the defendant\u2019s case in chief.\u201d) (citing John Henry Wigmore, <em>Evidence in Trials at Common Law </em>\u00a7 1873 (1976)). It is typically the case that evidence presented in defense to a claim would be \u201crebuttal\u201d evidence; if it is not, it would be, in effect, irrelevant under Rule 401. Of course, a plaintiff may himself proffer rebuttal evidence to counter evidence offered by a defendant to defeat the plaintiffs claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-8\">To determine whether evidence is \u201crebuttal\u201d evidence, a court must ask whether the rebuttal evidence is proffered to counter evidence that the defendant has offered, or whether it is simply a continuation of the plaintiffs case in-chief. <em>See Marmo v. Tyson Fresh Meats, Inc., </em>457 F.3d 748, 759 (8th Cir.2006) (finding that the district court acted within its discretion to deny the plaintiffs application to re-designate a rebuttal expert as a case-in-chief expert, two years after the defendant challenged the plaintiffs expert as improperly designated as a \u201crebuttal\u201d expert when his opinions addressed an element of plaintiffs claim). If the adverse party has not raised an issue to which such evidence is responsive, it is not \u201crebuttal\u201d evidence. <em>See id.; United States v. Neary, </em>733 F.2d 210, 219-20 (2d Cir.1984) (rejecting the introduction of certain evidence as improper rebuttal evidence); Casey <em>v.

[W]hether testimony should be allowed on rebuttal is a matter so clearly within the discretion of the judge ... that we think no more need be said.\u201d <em>Koseatac v. Rubin, </em>4 Fed.Appx. 84, 86 (2d Cir.2001) (alterations in original) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b296-10\">III. MOTIONS DIRECTED AT THE EXPERTS</p>\n<p id=\"b296-11\">In deciding a motion for summary judgment, a court may consider only ad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>missible evidence. <em>Raskin v. Wyatt Co., </em>125 F.3d 55, 66 (2d Cir.1997). When a party offers expert declarations in support of its position, and a motion has been made to exclude such expert, a court must decide that motion first, in order to determine whether such testimony may be considered in connection with summary judgment. <em>See id. </em>\u201cThis is true even if the exclusion of expert testimony would be outcome-determinative.\u201d <em>Berk v.

The Auditors deposed Epstein; shortly thereafter, and prior to the date when the Auditors were to disclose rebuttal experts, plaintiffs made a strategic decision to pull Epstein and proceed solely with Hou. According to plaintiffs, Epstein\u2019s absence has rendered Nurczyn-ski'and Mackintosh moot, because they are only \u201crebuttal\u201d experts, and Epstein is no longer in need of being rebutted.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">The Auditors also seek to offer Weimin. In response, plaintiffs argue that Weimin does not have experience directly relevant to this case and therefore his opinions are based on <em>ipse dixit </em>alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-7\">A. <em>Hou</em></p>\n<p id=\"b297-8\">Plaintiffs allege that the Auditors committed securities fraud under Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5. Defendants have moved for summary judgment on that claim on the basis, <em>inter alia, </em>that plaintiffs have failed to raise a triable fact as to the necessary element of scienter.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-10\">Plaintiffs do not assert that direct evidence shows that the Auditors intentionally engaged in securities fraud. Instead, plaintiffs claim that the Auditors\u2019 conduct was reckless \u2014 that its conduct was \u201chighly unreasonable, representing an extreme departure from the standards of ordinary care,\u201d and approximating \u201can actual intent to aid in the fraud being perpetrated by the audited company.\u201d <em>Rothman, </em>220 F.3d at 98 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b297-11\">This Court\u2019s obligation as gatekeeper requires that it determine whether the opinions Hou seeks to offer are relevant to the case, and whether she has the requisite expertise to offer them. <em>See Daubert, </em>509 U.S. at 593 n. 10, 113 S.Ct. 2786; <em>Nimely, </em>414 F.3d at 396-97. As with all evidence, Hou\u2019s opinions are relevant to this case only to the extent they \u201cmake a fact at issue more or less probable than it would be without\u201d her opinions. Fed.R.Evid. 401; <em>see Daubert, </em>509 U.S. at 587, 113 S.Ct. 2786 (\u201c \u2018Relevant evidence\u2019 is defined as that which has \u2018any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probably or less probable than it would be without the evidence.\u2019 \u201d); <em>In re Fosamax Prods. Liab. Litig., </em>509 Fed.Appx. 69, 74 (2d Cir.2013) (finding that the district court properly barred an expert opinion that was not relevant to the claims tried to the jury); <em>Jackson v. Harsch, </em>116 F.3d 465, 465 (2d Cir.1997) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b297-12\">It is clear that the relevant standard of care against which the Court must measure the Auditors\u2019 conduct to evaluate scienter is that of an auditor conducting an audit under the PCAOB (United States) standards. Those are the standards to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>which MSHK refers in its 2009 and 2010 audit opinion letters; those are the standards alleged that the SCAC alleges were breached; those are the standards to which plaintiffs repeatedly refer in their filings on these motions. <em>{See, e.g., </em>Pis.\u2019 56.1 Resp. \u00b6 28; MSHK 56.1 \u00b6\u00b624, 83.)</p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\">Plaintiffs have proffered Hou as an expert in Hong Kong and/or PRC generally accepted auditing standards. (Hou Rep. \u00b6 1.1.) In support of Hou\u2019s opinion, plaintiffs argue that MSHK\u2019s expert, Mackintosh, has not \u201cindicate[d] that PCAOB, Hong Kong, and PRC standards differ in any way with respect to the audit procedures confirming non-routine transactions\u201d; that \u201csufficient evidence\u201d is required to justify audit conclusions; and that Hou has experience with books and records in the PRC. (Pis.\u2019 Mem. of L. in Opp. to Def. Moore Stephens\u2019s Mot. to Exclude Hou (\u201cPis.\u2019 Hou Opp.\u201d) 3.) According to plaintiffs, \u201calthough not a CPA in the United States, Ms. Hou can provide plenty of relevant information on the issue of evidence of ownership of a PRC-based company such that the jury can find the facts necessary to support a determination that it was reckless for the Auditors not have found that the business was gone.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 4.)</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">This Court does not find that Hou has the necessary expertise to offer any opinions on the only relevant standard of care applicable to Auditors in this case: the standard of care applicable to auditors conducting an audit of a U.S. registered company pursuant to PCAOB standards. She has herself never conducted such an audit, she does not have the requisite training, and she herself concedes that she lacks qualifications to opine in this area. (Pis.\u2019 56.1 Resp. \u00b6\u00b6 7, 224; MSHK 56.1 Resp. \u00b6\u00b6 101, 103.) Even under the relatively liberal standards governing expert qualifications in the Second Circuit, Hou\u2019s qualifications are inadequate. <em>See Daubert, </em>509 U.S. at 592 n. 10, 113 S.Ct. 2786; <em>Tin Yat Chin, </em>371 F.3d at 40; <em>Arista Records, </em>2011 WL 1674796, at *2; <em>Johnson &amp; Johnson Vision Care, </em>2006 WL 2128785, at *6; <em>Cary Oil Co., </em>2003 WL 1878246, at *2. It is not a matter of \u201cnot enough\u201d expertise on PCAOB standards; rather, it is that she has none. Accordingly, this Court does not believe that Hou will \u201chelp the trier of fact ... to determine\u201d whether the Auditors\u2019 conduct fell egregiously short of the applicable standard of care. Fed.R.Evid. 702; <em>see also Nimely, </em>414 F.3d at 396-97. Hou\u2019s opinions regarding auditing standards applicable to Hong Kong and PRC audits .are simply not relevant to any issue requiring determination in this case. Thus, her opinions \u2014 based on the relevant expertise she does have, relating to Hong Kong and PRC auditing standards \u2014 are irrelevant and excluded under Rule 402 of the Federal Rules of Evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-7\">While it is true that Hou has opined that the standards for Hong Kong, PRC and \u201cUnited States\u201d audits are \u201csimilar\u201d (Hou Rep. \u00b6\u00b6 1.3, 2.18, 5.5-5.7, 6.1), that is insufficient to render her expertise relevant and opinions both relevant and reliable. As an initial matter, it is not clear whether the \u201cauditing standards in the United States\u201d to which Hou refers are PCAOB standards only, or whether she intends to include other standards as well; it is therefore unclear which standards are \u201csimilar\u201d to others. <em>(See id.) </em>Because Hou opines generally that \u201c[s]imilar concepts, rationale, and principles\u201d are used in the two sets of standards, it is also entirely unclear whether Hou intends \u201csimilarity\u201d of standards to mean \u201cequivalence\u201d \u2014 and, if so, equivalent in all respects or only some respects. <em>(See id. </em>at \u00b6 1.1.) This is, of course, highly relevant to the question of whether reference to auditing procedures <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>under Hong Kong and PRC standards have any bearing on PCAOB standards. It is not the case that, simply because Shanxi Coal is a PRC-based company, the Auditors\u2019 conduct must be assessed against PRC- or Hong Kong-based standards in this securities action.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-4\">To the extent that Hou could provide information relating to bookkeeping and recordkeeping in Hong Kong or the PRC, those statements are buried within her views as to whether the Auditors did or did not perform steps under the Hong Kong and PRC standards against which she was measuring their conduct. <em>(See generally id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 9.1-10.28.) Hou\u2019s opinions run the very real risk of misleading the jury as to the applicable standard of care. In addition, the Court will not allow Hou\u2019s statements relating to books and records (for instance, SAIC records and the CVRs) to be detached from Hou\u2019s broader opinions and presented alone, as there is similarly a real risk of \u201cconfusion of the issues, or misleading the jury\u201d as to the applicable standard of care for auditors. <em>See Nimely, </em>414 F.3d at 396 (quoting Fed.R.Evid. 403).</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">If plaintiffs were offering a separate expert in PCAOB standards and proffering Hou as a secondary expert, the Court would consider whether a cautionary instruction would resolve potential confusion. However, plaintiffs are not offering any expert on PCAOB standards; Hou would testify as plaintiffs\u2019 \u201caccounting expert\u201d in their case in chief. Under such circumstances, the risk is real and great that a factfinder would take Hou\u2019s opinions as setting the standard of care against which the Auditors\u2019 conduct should be measured.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-8\">In the absence of relevant expertise, Hou\u2019s opinions that assert that the Auditors performed inadequately are unreliable. <em>See Daubert, </em>509 U.S. at 595, 113 S.Ct. 2786 (citing Fed.R.Evid. 702); <em>Nimely, </em>414 F.3d at 396-97; <em>Arista Records, </em>2011 WL 1674796, at *1. Reliability is a question of methodology; here, the basis of Hou\u2019s methodology, her application of Hong Kong and PRC accounting standards, is an inappropriate starting point.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b299-9\">For these reasons, MSHK\u2019s motion to exclude Hou\u2019s expert report and testimony and MSHK\u2019s motion to strike Hou\u2019s declarations are GRANTED.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-10\">B. <em>Mackintosh and Nurczynski</em></p>\n<p id=\"Ath\">Plaintiffs\u2019 primary argument in support of excluding Mackintosh and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>Nurczynski is procedural: that both are \u201ccase-in-chief\u201d experts and should have been disclosed on the date for disclosure of such experts rather than on the date for disclosure of \u201crebuttal\u201d experts. This argument takes on particular significance in light of plaintiffs\u2019 strategic decision not to proffer an expert on PCAOB or Appendix K standards as part of their case in chief. Plaintiffs instead proffered Hou, an expert in Hong Kong and/or PRC auditing standards that are not at issue in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-3\">Plaintiffs\u2019 procedural argument is unavailing. The Court notes that plaintiffs have had a full and fair opportunity to depose both Mackintosh and Nurczynski and therefore will not be sandbagged at trial. <em>See Haas v. Del. &amp; Hudson Ry. Co., </em>282 Fed.Appx. 84, 86 (2d Cir.2008) (discussing the \u201cpractice of \u2018sandbagging\u2019 an opposing party with new evidence\u201d). Both experts would provide testimony that addresses core issues in this case: whether MSHK and MSPC complied with the relevant standard of care. This expert testimony proffered by the Auditors, as defendants, undoubtedly counters and rebuts plaintiffs\u2019 claim that the Auditors\u2019 conduct fell egregiously short. <em>See, e.g., Weiss v. Chrysler Motors Corp., </em>515 F.2d 449, 458-59 (2d Cir.1975) (finding that the district court should have admitted expert testimony as rebuttal evidence, even if the evidence could have been admissible on the case in chief).</p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\">Plaintiffs\u2019 procedural argument\u2014that, because they chose to withdraw their accounting expert on the same topics, there is no role for the Auditors\u2019 rebuttal experts\u2014is misguided. If plaintiffs were correct, then the sequence of exchanging expert reports would grant plaintiff a unilateral veto right over the type of proof the Auditors may offer in their own defense. There is no legal basis for such a position. So long as plaintiffs assert that the Auditors breached their standard of care, the Auditors are entitled to defend against that claim. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Barrow, </em>400 F.3d 109, 120 (2d Cir.2005) (discussing the appropriate scope of rebuttal evidence); <em>United States v. Tejada, </em>956 F.2d 1256, 1256 (2d Cir.1992) (explaining that a \u201cdistrict court has wide discretion over what evidence may be presented on rebuttal\u201d). If plaintiffs were to drop their claim, then these two witnesses would be unnecessary, and so would be these motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">In addition, the Court views plaintiffs\u2019 'decision to withdraw its primary accounting expert as a tactical decision, and one that plaintiffs are no doubt entitled to make. However, they cannot withdraw their expert and expect that they can thereby achieve a secondary benefit of controlling the Auditors\u2019 expert choices. If plaintiffs had disclosed to the Auditors during negotiations over the stipulation regarding the manner and timing of the exchange of reports that they did not intend to submit an accounting expert on PCAOB standards, and then the Auditors submitted the Mackintosh and Nurczynski reports as rebuttal reports, then plaintiffs\u2019 procedural argument might have some traction. However, as the Court understands the timing of events here, there was no such prior disclosure. In fact, plaintiffs originally intended to, and did, submit a primary accounting expert report from Epstein. <em>(See </em>Massengill Deck Ex. 5.) Having deposed Mackintosh and Nurczyn-ski, plaintiffs will not be sandbagged at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-7\">Finally, the Court notes that Mackintosh and Nurczynski do, in fact, address opinions proffered by Hou; both experts address the same subject matter as Hou, including Appendix K procedures and MSPC and MSHK\u2019s compliance with auditing standards. <em>See, e.g., SEC v. Ba</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number><em>dian, </em>No. 06-cv-2621 (LTS)(DFE), 2009 WL 5178537, at (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 23, 2009) (explaining that a rebuttal expert \u201cis free to support his opinions with evidence not cited in\u201d an opposing expert\u2019s \u201creports so long as he rebuts the same \u2018subject matter\u2019 identified in those .reports\u201d). In that sense, Mackintosh and Nurczynski are \u201crebuttal\u201d experts in the manner described by plaintiffs. The Court is mindful that it is precluding Hou. However, as in many cases in which one side\u2019s expert is excluded and another\u2019s is not, the preclusion of one party\u2019s expert does not result in the automatic preclusion of the adverse party\u2019s expert on similar topics.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-4\">For these reasons, plaintiffs\u2019 motions to exclude Mackintosh and Nurczynski are DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">C. <em>Weimin</em></p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">Weimin is a lawyer who is actively practicing in the PRC. (Weimin Rep. 1.) He has personal experience with the type and purpose of certain documents referenced as part of plaintiffs\u2019 case. <em>(Id. </em>at 1, 2, 5-6.) The Court is unaware of another witness who would provide the type of explanatory testimony that Weimin proposes to provide. The Court thus finds by a preponderance of the evidence (1) that he is qualified to offer the limited opinions in his report, (2) that they are not <em>ipse-dixit </em>but instead based on his experience with these types of documents, and (3)-that such testimony will be helpful to the trier of fact. <em>See Nimely, </em>414 F.3d at 396-97 (citing Fed.R.Evid. 702).</p>\n<p id=\"b301-7\">Additional points that plaintiffs raise\u2014 regarding whether Weimin himself ever sought documents directly from the SAIC local office that possessed certain documents relevant to this case, and whether he would have himself relied on the CVRs at issue here \u2014 are questions best left for cross-examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-11\">Plaintiffs\u2019 motion to exclude Weimin is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-12\">IV. SUMMARY JUDGMENT MOTIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b301-13\">The Auditors assert several grounds in support of their motions for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-14\">The Auditors argue that there is no triable issue as to whether they acted with the requisite scienter or subjective falsity.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>See Tellabs, </em>551 U.S. at 319, 323, 127 S.Ct. 2499; <em>Rothman, </em>220 F.3d at 90; <em>Novak, </em>216 F.3d at 308. In addition, MSPC argues that it was also not a \u201cmaker\u201d of any of the statements under the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Janus, </em>131 S.Ct. at 2302. This Court agrees with each of these arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-15\">A. <em>Scienter</em></p>\n<p id=\"b301-16\">Plaintiffs do not allege that the Auditors had actual knowledge of the Zhao brothers\u2019 fraud, but rather that they conducted an inadequate audit and missed red flags. This claim requires a showing of reckless conduct \u2014 indeed, of \u201cshoddy accounting practices\u201d that fell so egregiously short of the applicable professional standards of care as to amount to \u201ca pretended audit\u201d or no audit at all. <em>Rothman, </em>220 F.3d at 98. To defeat the Auditors\u2019 motion for summary judgment based on lack of requisite scienter, plaintiffs must therefore raise a triable issue as to whether the Auditors\u2019 conduct fell egregiously short of applicable standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-17\">Plaintiffs have not raised a triable issue on this question. Expert testimony is not always required to establish a standard of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>care. <em>See, e.g., Rigas, </em>490 F.3d at 220-21; <em>Ebbers, </em>458 F.3d at 125-26. However, when the standard of care is one with which a reasonable lay juror is unfamiliar, such testimony may be necessary.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>See, e.g., SG Indus., </em>2011 WL 6090247, at *5; <em>McKowan Lowe, </em>2005 WL 1541062, at *14; <em>Dapremont, </em>2000 WL 1566532, at *5; <em>Hodge, </em>1993 WL 433601, at *1. This is such a case. Plaintiffs themselves concede that the adequacy of the Auditors\u2019 conduct with respect to their work for Puda is \u201cforeign to a jury.\u201d (Pl.\u2019s Hou Opp. 11.) This Court agrees.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\">It is certainly true that the issue that plaintiffs assert that the Auditors failed to catch can be readily summarized in a manner comprehensible to the layperson: the company that MSHK was auditing had been transferred away; Puda no longer owned Shanxi Coal, and yet claimed it did. However, that concise summary obscures the more complicated question of whether the Auditors failed to exercise the appropriate professional standard of care \u2014 and indeed fell \u201cegregiousQy]\u201d short of such a standard, <em>Chill, </em>101 F.3d at 269\u2014in conducting procedures which failed to uncover that fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">As discussed above, MSHK stated that it conducted its audits in compliance with PCAOB standards; the SCAC alleges that the audits failed to comply with PCAOB standards; and the plaintiffs\u2019 statements of material facts repeatedly assert that the Auditors failed to comply with PCAOB standards. (SCAC \u00b6\u00b6 24; Pis.\u2019 56.1 Resp. \u00b6\u00b6 28, 61; MSHK 56.1 \u00b6\u00b683, 99.) In short, it is crystal-clear that the professional standards of care against which the Auditors\u2019 conduct must be measured are PCAOB standards. <em>See S. Cherry Street, </em>573 F.3d at 109 (explaining that the conduct in question must have been an \u201cextreme departure from the standards of ordinary care\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b302-9\">Plaintiffs have put forth no admissible evidence as to what PCAOB standards the Auditors failed to comply with; nor have they offered any admissible evidence that their conduct not only failed but egregiously failed to meet those standards. Indeed, to raise a triable issue as- to recklessness, plaintiffs must put forth facts that could lead to an inference that, under the applicable PCAOB standards, the Auditors\u2019 practices constituted \u201cshoddy accounting practices\u201d that fell so egregiously short of the applicable professional standards of care as to amount to \u201ca pretended audit\u201d or no audit at all. <em>Rothman, </em>220 F.3d at 98. Plaintiffs have not made any showing in this regard at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-10\">Instead, for tactical reasons best known to'themselves, plaintiffs withdrew the only \u2022accounting expert they had on PCAOB standards, Barry Epstein. (Massengill Decl. Exs. 5, 87; Pis.\u2019 Mackintosh Mot. 2 n. 1.) They were left with Hou, an accountant perhaps skilled in audits using other standards \u2014 those of Hong Kong or the PRC \u2014 but not PCAOB standards. <em>(See </em>Hou Rep. \u00b6 1.1.) Hou herself conceded that she was not offering, and was not qualified to offer, any opinion as to whether the audits complied with PCAOB standards. (Pis.\u2019 56.1 Resp. \u00b6\u00b6 7, 224; MSHK 56.1 Resp. \u00b6 101, 103.) For the reasons set forth above, the Court has excluded Hou; in any event, her testimony could not raise a triable issue as to the Auditors\u2019 compliance with PCAOB standards when she offers no admissible opinion in that regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>Plaintiffs instead argue that MSHK\u2019s failure to obtain Shanxi\u2019s SAIC files was reckless; and that its reliance on the CVRs, the unsigned \u201cform\u201d legal opinion letters, and the 2007 business licenses raise a triable issue as to recklessness. The Court has considered these arguments carefully. Again and again, however, the Court returns to the question of whether a reasonable auditor <em>would </em>have taken such steps under the circumstances, not whether a reasonable auditor <em>could </em>have. Again and again, the Court is left with the conviction that proof is necessary of what auditors conducting audit procedures under PCAOB standards would do; how many steps and which steps would be enough; and where to draw lines between what is a belt alone and when the belt is combined with suspenders. Could more have been done? Clearly yes. Did more need to be done, and would auditors conducting a PCAOB-compliant audit have done more? Neither the Court nor any reasonable juror at a trial has any way to answer this question.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">In contrast, the Auditors have proffered admissible testimony from Mackintosh and Nurezynski that they conducted audits and the Appendix K reviews according to PCAOB standards. <em>(See, e.g., </em>Mackintosh Rep. 54.) This testimony stands unrebut-ted. Mackintosh and Nurezynski each have extensive experience in PCAOB compliant audits; they have each reviewed the work of the Auditors here; and they each state that the audits of MSHK (Mackintosh) and MSPC (Nurezynski) complied with those professional standards. In other words, the only testimony in the record supports an inference that neither auditor committed even negligence in the execution of its responsibilities, let alone conducted themselves in a manner that was an \u201cegregious refusal to see the obvious,\u201d <em>Chill, </em>101 F.3d at 269, or in a manner that was \u201chighly unreasonable and which represents an extreme departure from the standards of ordinary care,\u201d <em>S. Cherry Street, </em>573 F.3d at 109.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-7\">As a result, plaintiffs have not raised a triable issue as to scienter. Summary judgment as to the Section 10 claim against the Auditors is appropriate on that basis alone. <em>See Lentell, </em>396 F.3d at 172 (listing the elements of a Section 10 claim).</p>\n<p id=\"b303-8\">B. <em>Subjective Falsity</em></p>\n<p id=\"b303-9\">Section 10 and 11 claims regarding opinion statements require that the statement was both objectively false at the time that it was made and also subjectively false \u2014 that is, that defendants did not honestly believe the statements when they made them. <em>See Fait, </em>655 F.3d at 113. Plaintiffs have failed to raise a triable issue as to subjective falsity.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-10\">Audit statements, such as the clean audit opinions presented by the Auditors in this case, are statements of opinion to which the subjective falsity requirement applies. <em>See, e.g., Fait, </em>655 F.3d at (affirming the district court\u2019s determination that audit opinions were statements \u201cof judgment and opinion, rather than fact,\u201d and applying the subjective falsity requirement); <em>In re Lehman Bros. Sec. &amp; Erisa Litig., </em>799 F.Supp.2d 258, 300 (S.D.N.Y.2011) (stating that Section 11 of the Securities Act requires subjective falsity because an auditor\u2019s \u201copinion, just like those rendered by all or substantially all accounting firms, is explicitly labeled as just that \u2014 an opinion that the audit complied with these broadly stated standards\u201d); <em>In re Scottish Re Group Sec. Litig., </em>524 F.Supp.2d 370, 398 (S.D.N.Y.2007) (discussing the standard for auditor statements under Section 10).</p>\n<p id=\"b303-11\">Here, there is no evidence before the Court that the Auditors knew that the Zhao brothers had transferred Shanxi <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>Coal to themselves in 2009. <em>(See </em>Pis.\u2019. 56.1 Resp. \u00b6\u00b6 15-17.) Indeed, the evidence in the record and plaintiffs\u2019 arguments- regarding scienter paint a narrative of dupes \u2014 an auditor and reviewer that failed to figure this fundamental fact out.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\">In the absence of a triable issue as to subjective falsity, both the Section 11 and 10 claims against the Auditors must be dismissed. <em>See Fait, </em>655 F.3d at 113 (\u201cBecause the complaint does not plausibly allege subjective falsity, it fails to state a claim.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">C. <em>Maker of the Statements</em></p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">MSPC has also argued that, as a reviewer of MSHK\u2019s opinion, it did not \u201cmake\u201d the statements for purposes of securities law liability, <em>Janus, </em>131 S.Ct. at 2301. <em>(See </em>Def.

The Court\" need not reach this issue because its rulings as set forth above result in separate and complete bases for dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-7\">V. PLAINTIFF\u2019S MOTION TO STRIKE</p>\n<p id=\"b304-8\">Finally, plaintiffs have moved to strike \u201cDefendant Moore Stephens Hong Kong\u2019s Reply in Support of its Statement of Material Facts Upon Which There is No Genuine Issue for Trial.\u201d The rules of the Court neither require nor forbid such a statement, <em>see </em>Local Civil Rule 56.1, and courts in the Second Circuit routinely receive such replies. . Indeed, the circumstances of MSHK\u2019s motion for summary judgment \u2014 in which, moving first, MSHK was required to anticipate the arguments that plaintiffs would present in response\u2014 highlight the propriety of considering this reply. The Court is, of course, capable of individually considering each factual assertion in the parties\u2019 Rule 56.1 statements to determine whether it is factually supported or merely speculative.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-12\">In any event, plaintiffs\u2019 motion is moot. The Court has relied throughout this opinion solely on the \u201c[Corrected] Plaintiffs\u2019 Response to Defendant Moore Stephens Hong Kong\u2019s Statement of Material Facts\u201d and \u201cDefendant Moore Stephens Hong Kong\u2019s Response to Plaintiffs\u2019 Separate Statements of Additional Material Facts,\u201d and has not relied on MSHK\u2019s reply in support of its own Rule 56.1 statement. The undisputed facts as reflected in those two Rule 56.1 statements provide sufficient basis for the Court\u2019s decisions as set forth above.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-13\">VI. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b304-14\">For the reasons set forth above, the Auditors\u2019 motions for summary judgment are GRANTED; the Auditors\u2019 motions to exclude Hou and strike her declarations are GRANTED; plaintiffs\u2019 motions to. exclude Mackintosh, Nurczynski, and Wei-min are DENIED; and plaintiffs\u2019 motion to strike MSHK\u2019s Rule 56.1 reply is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-15\">The Clerk of Court shall close the motions at ECF Nos. 297, 298, and 364 and remove the Opinion &amp; Order at ECF No. 384 from the docket.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b304-16\">SO ORDERED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b280-9\">. Claims remain pending against several defendants. On May 20 and 21, 2014, Brean <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>Murray, Carret &amp; Co. and Macquarie Capital (USA) Inc. filed motions to dismiss the SCAC. (ECF Nos. 370, 373.) On June 2, 2014, defendants C. Mark Tang and Lawrence S. Wizel (the former U.S.-based independent directors of Puda), MSHK, and MSPC answered the SCAC. (ECF Nos. 377-379.) A somewhat complicated procedural history resulted in the Auditors and plaintiffs having completed discovery prior to the remaining defendants.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b285-7\">. MSHK argues that this Court should disregard this document because plaintiffs have taken no testimony to authenticate it. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 54.) However, on summary judgment this Court may consider documents that would be admissible at trial. <em>See, e.g., Raskin v. Wyatt Co., </em>125 F.3d 55, 66 (2d Cir.1997). This business record is the type of document that this Court assumes a corporate witness would authenticate prior to or at trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b286-7\">. MSHK argues that the Court should disregard this document because plaintiffs have not authenticated it or deposed legal counsel. For the same reasons set forth in footnote 2, the Court disagrees that it is not properly before the Court on this motion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b299-6\">. On March 28, 2014, in opposition to the Auditors\u2019 motions for summary judgment, Hou also submitted two separate declarations, the so-called \"Summary Judgment Declaration\u201d and \u201cDocumentation Declaration.\u201d On May 7, 2014, defendants moved to strike those declarations as a procedurally improper attempt to amend her expert report; plaintiffs assert that experts may submit separate declarations on summary judgment, and this is just that. Hou's Summary Judgment Declaration is struck. The law leaves no doubt that this Court should only consider on summary judgment admissible evidence. <em>Raskin, </em>125 F.3d at 66. Because Hou did not include PCAOB-based opinions in her expert report \u2014 she only provided certain comparisons to PCAOB standards for informational purposes \u2014 she is precluded from now attempting to testify to the opinions in her \"summary judgment\u201d declaration. Accordingly, such testimony is inadmissible, and this Court may not rely on it in deciding the summary judgment motions. In addition, the Court finds that Hou\u2019s own prior admissions as to a lack of expertise in PCAOB standards <em>(see </em>Pis.' 56.1 Resp. \u00b6\u00b6 7, 224; MSHK 56.1 Resp. \u00b6 101, 103) contradict with her statement in her Summary Judgment Declaration that she \"could competently testify to the facts\u201d that she sets forth (Decl. of Anita CM Hou Dated Mar. 28, 2014 \u00b6 3). Thus, MSHK's to strike Hou\u2019s Summary Judgment Declaration of March 28, 2014 is GRANTED. MSHK\u2019s motion to strike Hou's Documentation Declaration of March 28, 2014 is DENIED as moot in light of the Court\u2019s preclusion of her proposed expert testimony more generally.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b301-8\">.
