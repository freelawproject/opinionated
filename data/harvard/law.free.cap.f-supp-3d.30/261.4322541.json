FORREST, District Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b308-12\">The second consolidated amended complaint in this matter (\u201cCompl.,\u201d ECF No. 352) asserts claims, <em>inter alia, </em>against Bre-an Murray, Carret &amp; Co. (\u201cBrean Murray\u201d) and Macquarie Capital (USA) Inc. (\u201cMacquarie\u201d) (collectively, the \u201cunderwriters\u201d), the underwriters of a public stock offering by Puda Coal Ine. (\u201cPuda\u201d), under Sections 11 and 12 of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-13\">Now before the Court are the underwriters\u2019 motions to dismiss the complaint on the grounds that (1) plaintiffs fail to allege that the underwriters \u201cmade\u201d the false statements within the meaning of Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5, (2) plaintiffs fail to allege facts sufficient for scienter, (3) plaintiff Trellus\u2019s claims are time-barred, and (4) Trellus lacks standing. (ECF Nos. 370, 373.)</p>\n<p id=\"b308-14\">For the reasons set forth below, both motions are DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-15\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b308-16\">The Court assumes familiarity with the factual background underlying this action. This action arises from an alleged fraudulent scheme orchestrated by defendant Ming Zhao (\u201cZhao\u201d) to mislead investors as to the true ownership of Puda\u2019s primary operating subsidiary, the Shanxi Puda Coal Group Co., Ltd. (\u201cShanxi\u201d). Although Puda represented in public filings throughout the putative class period that it owned 90% of Shanxi Coal, Zhao (Puda\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>former chairman and its controlling shareholder) had secretly transferred Puda\u2019s interest in the subsidiary first to himself and then to an unrelated private equity fund, effectively leaving Puda a shell company without any assets, operations, or revenues. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 8, 9, 11, 13, 81, 87.)</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">During the putative class period, Puda conducted two separate public offerings without disclosing the transfers. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 18.) In February 2010, Puda conducted the first public offering, for which Brean Murray was the underwriter. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 54-56.) In December 2010, Puda conducted the second public offering, for which Mac-quarie and Brean Murray were co-underwriters. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 18, 42, 54-56.) In this capacity, the underwriters \u201cserved as financial advisors, assisted in the preparation and dissemination of the offering materials for the December Offering, and had ultimate authority over the content of the Prospectus; the Underwriters\u2019 names were prominently displayed on the .first page of the offering prospectus as \u2018Joint Bookrunning Managers.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 56.) \u201cMacquarie and Brean Murray jointly with Puda\u2019s officers drafted\u201d the prospectus in question and delivered it to investors. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 235.)</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">Before the December 2010 offering, Macquarie hired Kroll Inc. to assist with Macquarie\u2019s due diligence efforts, specifically to \u201cperform background checks with respect to Puda and persons associated therewith.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>\u00b657.) On December 2,. 2010, Kroll delivered to Macquarie an investigative report showing that, based upon public State Administration of Industry and Commerce (\u201cSAIC\u201d) records, Puda did not in fact own 90% of Shanxi Coal. <em>(Id.) </em>Six days before the December offering, Kroll identified the true owners of Shanxi to Macquarie. <em>(Id.) </em>The Kroll report was reviewed and disseminated among several Macquarie employees as well as legal counsel for both underwriters. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 152.)</p>\n<p id=\"b309-8\">The instant motions relate primarily to registration statements and a prospectus that Puda'filed with the SEC in connection with the December 2010 offering. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 114.) Plaintiffs .allege that these statements and prospectus were false and misleading because they represented that Puda owned 90% of Shanxi without disclosing the transfers. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 116,117.)</p>\n<p id=\"b309-9\">II. APPLICABLE LEGAL PRINCIPLES</p>\n<p id=\"b309-10\">A. <em>Rule 12(b)(6) Motion to Dismiss</em></p>\n<p id=\"b309-11\">To survive a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, a complaint must allege \u201cenough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\u201d <em>Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 570, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007). \u201cA claim has facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.\u201d <em>Ashcroft v. Iqbal </em>556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009). In applying that standard, the court accepts as true all well-pleaded factual allegations and draws all reasonable inferences in plaintiffs favor, but does not credit \u201cmere conclusory statements\u201d or \u201c[tjhreadbare recitals of the elements of a cause of action.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b309-13\">B. <em>Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 of the Securities Exchange Act</em></p>\n<p id=\"b309-14\">To state a cause of action under Section 10(b) or Rule 10b-5, plaintiffs must set forth sufficient plausible allegations that defendants \u201c(1) made misstatements or omissions of material fact; (2) with scienter; (3) in connection -with the pur-ch\u00e1se or sale of securities; (4) upon which plaintiffs relied; and (5) that plaintiffs\u2019 reliance was the proximate cause of their injury.\u201d <em>In re IBM Corp. Sec. Litig., </em>163 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>F.3d 102, 106 (1998). \u201cFor purposes of Rule 10b-5, the maker of a statement is the entity with authority over the content of the statement and whether and how to communicate it.\u201d <em>Janus Capital Grp., Inc. v. First Derivative Traders, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 2296, 2303, 180 L.Ed.2d 166 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b310-7\">\u201cSecurities fraud claims are subject to heightened pleading requirements that the plaintiff must meet to survive a motion to dismiss.\u201d <em>ATSI Commc\u2019ns, Inc. v. Shaar Fund, Ltd., </em>493 F.3d 87, 99 (2d Cir.2007). Of particular relevance here,' the complaint must \u201cstate with particularity facts giving rise to a strong inference that the defendant acted with the required state of mind\u201d \u2014 that is, scienter. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78u-4(b)(2)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b310-8\">Scienter is the \u201cmental state embracing intent to deceive, manipulate, or defraud\u201d by the maker of a statement. <em>Tellabs, Inc. v. Makor Issues &amp; Rights, Ltd., </em>551 U.S. 308, 319, 127 S.Ct. 2499, 168 L.Ed.2d 179 (2007). When deciding a motion pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), the inquiry \u201cis whether <em>all </em>of the facts alleged, taken collectively, give rise to a strong inference of scienter.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 322-23, 127 S.Ct. 2499 (emphasis in original). <em>\u201cA </em>complaint will survive ... only .if a reasonable person would deem the inference of scienter cogent and at least as compelling as any opposing inference one could draw from the facts alleged.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 324, 127 S.Ct. 2499.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-9\">The Second Circuit has \u201clong held that the scienter element can be satisfied by a strong showing of reckless disregard for the truth. By reckless disregard for the truth, we mean conscious recklessness\u2014 <em>ie., </em>a state of mind <em>approximating actual intent, </em>and <em>not merely a heightened form of negligence.\u201d S. Cherry Street, LLC v. Hennessee Grp. LLC, </em>573 F.3d 98, 110 (2d Cir.2009) (emphasis in original) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted); <em>see also Novak v. Kasaks, </em>216 F.3d 300, 308 (2d Cir.2000) (explaining that recklessness is \u201chighly unreasonable\u201d conduct that represents \u201can extreme departure from the standards of ordinary care\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b310-11\">C. <em>Sections 11 and 12 of the Securities Act</em></p>\n<p id=\"b310-12\">\u201cSections 11 and 12(a)(2) of the Securities Act impose liability on certain participants in a registered securities offering when the registration statement or prospectus contains material misstatements or omissions.\u201d <em>Panther Partners Inc. v. Ikanos Commc\u2019ns, Inc., </em>681 F.3d 114, 119 (2d Cir.2012). Section 11 imposes liability for misstatements or omissions in registration statements, whereas Section 12 imposes liability for misstatements or omissions in prospectuses. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b310-13\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"AHL\">A. <em>The Underwriters </em>as <em>\u201cMakers\u201d of the Statements</em></p>\n<p id=\"b310-14\">Defendants argue that plaintiffs have failed to allege that they were \u201cmakers\u201d of the material misstatements at issue within the meaning of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5. Under <em>Janus, </em>the \u201cmaker of a statement is the person or entity with ultimate authority over the statement, including its content and whether and how to communicate it.... [I]n the ordinary case, attribution, within a statement or implicit from surrounding circumstances is strong evidence that a statement was made by \u2014 and only by \u2014 the party to whom it is attributed.\u201d <em>Janus, </em>131 S.Ct. at 2302. Relying on <em>Janus, </em>several district courts have sustained Section 10(b) claims brought against underwriters. <em>See Scott v. ZST Digital Networks, Inc., </em>896 F.Supp.2d 877, 890 (C.D.Cal.2012) (sustaining a Section 10(b) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>claim against an underwriter whose name appeared on the statement in question); <em>In re Nat\u2019l Century Fin. Enters., Inc., </em>846 F.Supp.2d 828, 861 (S.D.Ohio 2012) (same); <em>In re Allstate Life Ins. Co. Litig., </em>No. cv-09-8162 (GMS), 2012 WL 176497, at *5 (D.Ariz. Jan. 23, 2012) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">Macquarie, with whom Brean Murray joins for purposes of this argument, asserts that it was not the \u201cmaker\u201d of the misstatements in Puda\u2019s prospectus and registration statements. Rather, Mac-quarie argues that the prospectus was <em>Puda\u2019s </em>document, and that <em>Puda </em>\u2014 not Macquarie \u2014 made any statements contained in that prospectus. <em>(See, e.g., </em>Compl. \u00b6 10 (alleging that \u201cthe Company\u201d represented to investors that Puda owned 90% of Shanxi), 234 (alleging that \u201cthe Company\u2019s\u201d prospectuses and registration statements were false and misleading) (emphasis added).)</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">This Court disagrees. Under <em>Janus, </em>\u201cattribution within a statement or implicit from surrounding circumstances is strong evidence that a statement was made by \u2014 and only by \u2014 the party to whom it is attributed.\u201d 131 S.Ct. at 2302. With facts construed and inferences drawn in plaintiffs\u2019 favor, the complaint alleges that Macquarie had authority over the information contained in the prospectus sufficient to make its statements attributable to Macquarie. The complaint alleges that the underwriters \u201cactively participated in creating the Prospectus, drafting it jointly with Puda management.\u201d (Compl. \u00b6 137.) Pursuant to its formal agreement with the underwriters, Puda agreed to \u201cprepare the Prospectus in a form approved by\u201d Mae-quarie. (Rosen Decl. Ex. 2, at \u00b6 5(a)(i), ECF No. 386.) Indeed, on the morning of the December offering, Puda\u2019s counsel sent an email stating that, while the \u201cCompany has signed off,\u201d Puda\u2019s counsel still did not have \u201cthe underwriters\u2019 sign off.\u201d (Compl. \u00b6 138.) Thus, the complaint alleges that, \u201c[ajbsent Macquarie\u2019s sign-off and approval, the Prospectus would not have been filed with the SEC and disseminated to investors.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 139.)</p>\n<p id=\"b311-9\">Furthermore, the complaint alleges that the underwriters communicated their involvement with the prospectus to the investing public in several ways. The front cover of the prospectus prominently displayed both underwriters\u2019 names, thus endorsing the statements within the prospectus to investors. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 56.) Macquarie also solicited investors for the offering and distributed the prospectus to investors. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 56, 137.) Finally, the prospectus provided that the underwriters were authorized to make representations about Puda shares. <em>(See </em>Rosen Decl. Ex. 1, at S \u2014 2.) Construed in plaintiffs\u2019 favor, these facts are sufficient to show \u201cattribution within a statement or implicit from surrounding circumstances\u201d such that the statements within the prospectus are attributable to the underwriters. <em>Janus, </em>131 S.Ct. at 2302.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-10\">The underwriters cite several cases for the proposition that the underwriters\u2019 actions here \u2014 participating in drafting and disseminating the December 2010 prospectus \u2014 are insufficient for them to have \u201cmade\u201d the statements. However, the cases on which the underwriters rely are distinguishable.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b312-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>First, Macquarie cites <em>Pacific Investment Mgmt. Co. LLC v. Mayer Brown LLP </em>for the proposition that \u201csecondary actors can be liable in a private action under Rule 10b-5 for only those statements that are explicitly attributed to them. The mere identification of a secondary actor as being involved in a transaction, or the public\u2019s understanding that a secondary actor \u2018is at work behind the scenes\u2019 are alone insufficient.\u201d 603 F.3d 144 (2d Cir.2010). However, that case dealt with a law firm that was merely \u201cmention[ed]\u201d on offering documents as having represented the issuing party as legal counsel. <em>Id. </em>at 158. The complaint in this case, with reasonable inferences drawn in favor of the plaintiffs, alleges facts supporting asserting far more intricate involvement by the underwriters. <em>(See </em>Compl. \u00b6\u00b656, 137139; Rosen Decl. Ex. 1, at S2, Ex-2, at \u00b6 5(a)(i).) The underwriters\u2019 involvement in creating, approving, and disseminating the prospectus constitute \u201cattribution within a statement or implicit from surrounding circumstances\u201d sufficient for them to be \u201cmakers\u201d of the statements. <em>Janus, </em>131 S.Ct. at 2302.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-4\">Second, Macquarie cites <em>SEC v. Tambone </em>for the proposition that securities professionals do not \u201cimpliedly \u2018make\u2019 a representation to investors that the statements in a prospectus are truthful and complete.\u201d 597 F.3d 436, 447 (1st Cir.2010). However, in that case, the SEC did not allege that the defendant played a role in preparing the prospectus, but only in disseminating a prospectus. <em>See id. </em>at 439. Here, by contrast, plaintiff alleges not only that the underwriters distributed the prospectus, but that they were involved in preparing and signing off on the prospectus. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 56, 137; Rosen Decl. Ex. 2, at \u00b6 5(a)(i).) That combination of facts, construed in plaintiffs\u2019 favor, is sufficient at the pleading stage to show the necessary \u201cauthority over the content of the statement and whether and how to communicate it.\u201d <em>Janus, </em>131 S.Ct. at 2303.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-7\">Finally, both underwriters cite <em>In re Fannie Mae 2008 Sec. Litig. </em>for the proposition that generalized, conclusory statements that an underwriter \u201cmade\u201d the alleged misstatements are insufficient. 891 F.Supp.2d 458, 484 (S.D.N.Y.2012), <em>aff'd, </em>525 Fed.Appx. 16 (2d Cir.2013). However, the plaintiffs in that case did not allege facts supporting an attribution theory, as here; rather, plaintiffs\u2019 claims were based only on the underwriter\u2019s participation in preparing the prospectus. <em>See Fannie Mae, </em>891 F.Supp.2d at 484. Additionally, the prospectus there only incorporated the misrepresentations of previous SEC filings, over which Fannie Mae, not the underwriter, had authority; the prospectus itself did not contain the misstatements in question. <em>See id. </em>By contrast, the prospectus in this case itself contained the false statements that Puda conducted its operations through its subsidiary Shanxi. <em>(See, e.g., </em>Rosen Deck Ex. 1, at S-5.) The specific facts set forth in the complaint in this action are sufficient to survive a motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-8\">Brean Murray separately argues that the complaint alleges only that Macquarie, not Brean Murray, was the entity with ultimate authority over the documents. <em>(See </em>Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 139, 154, 235.) This Court again disagrees. The complaint does al<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>lege that Macquarie ultimately signed off on and approved the prospectus, but the complaint also alleges that it did so as the representative of <em>both </em>underwriters. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 139; Rosen Decl. Ex. 1, at S-22.) Additionally, both underwriters\u2019 names are displayed on the front cover of the December offering prospectus, and the prospectus provided that the \u201cunderwriters,\u201d not just Macquarie, were authorized to make representations about Puda. <em>(See </em>Compl. \u00b6 56; Rosen Decl. Ex. 1, at S-2.)</p>\n<p id=\"b313-4\">With all well-pleaded factual allegations assumed to be true and all reasonable inferences drawn in plaintiffs\u2019 favor, plaintiffs\u2019 allegations are sufficient at this stage to meet the \u201cheightened pleading requirements\u201d of a securities fraud claim, <em>ATSI Commc\u2019ns, </em>493 F.3d at 99, and to plead that both underwriters were \u201cmakers\u201d of the alleged misstatements within the meaning of Section 10(b) under <em>Janus.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">B. <em>The Underwriters\u2019 Scienter</em></p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">Brean Murray argues- that plaintiffs\u2019 factual allegations fail to allege the necessary scienter to survive a motion to dismiss under the \u201cheightened pleading requirements\u201d of a securities fraud claim. <em>ATSI Commc\u2019ns, </em>493 F.3d at 99. Brean Murray claims that the Kroll report was found only in Macquarie\u2019s files, and that it neither had the Kroll report nor was aware of the facts contained in the Kroll report. (Hr\u2019g Tr. 41, Mar. 10, 2014, ECF No. 332.) Rather than recklessly or deliberately closing its eyes to the issue of whether Puda actually owned Shanxi Coal, Brean Murray claims that it simply missed the ownership transfer through faulty due diligence. Thus, Brean Murray argues, an inference of negligence is far more \u201ccompelling\u201d than an inference of scienter, <em>Tellabs, </em>551 U.S. at 324, 127 S.Ct. 2499, which requires \u201cconscious <em>recklessness </em>\u2014 ie., a state of mind <em>approximating actual intent.\u201d S. Cherry Street, </em>573 F.3d at 110 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b313-8\">This Court disagrees. The Court is mindful, of course, that simply alleging that a party should have known of a fact is insufficient to survive a motion to dismiss. <em>See, e.g., Novak, </em>216 F.3d at 312. However, when construed in plaintiffs\u2019 favor, the allegations in the complaint indeed allege that the transfer was \u201cso obvious\u201d that Brean Murray \u201cmust-have been aware of it,\u201d <em>S. Cherry Street, </em>573 F.3d at 112, and \u201cconsciously disregarded it,\u201d <em>Dolphin &amp; Bradbury, Inc. v. SEC, </em>512 F.3d 634, 639 (D.C.Cir.2008)\u2014that is, that Brean Murray was reckless.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-9\">On April 8, 2011, after Alfred Little revealed Zhao\u2019s transfer of Shanxi, the chief executive officer (\u201cCEO\u201d) of Brean Murray, William McCluskey, stated in an email, \u201cWasn\u2019t this news talked about and dismissed a while ago?\u201d (Compl. \u00b6 164 <em>&amp; </em>n. 27.) Construed in plaintiffs\u2019 favor, that statement is enough to show that Brean Murray was aware of the transfer and consciously disregarded it. Moreover, Zhao\u2019s transfer of Shanxi to himself was not hidden and was in fact recorded in public files. An American money manager named Dan David, Kroll, and Puda\u2019s board of directors all were able to obtain documentation of the transfer through inquiring with the SAIC, where Zhao filed the relevant paperwork. <em>(See </em>Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 32, 150, 175.) The fact that Brean Murray lacked the Kroll report itself is not disposi-tive. In light of underwriters\u2019 \u201cunique position\u201d and the requirement that underwriters \u201cexercise \u00e1 high degree of care in investigation and independent verification of the company\u2019s representation,\u201d plaintiffs adequately allege that Brean Murray\u2019s failure to uncover the transfer was fraudulent. <em>See In re WorldCom, Inc. Sec. Litig., </em>346 F.Supp.2d 628, 662 (S.D.N.Y.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b314-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>For these reasons, the factual assertions in the complainN \u2014 assumed to be true and with all reasonable inferences drawn in plaintiffs\u2019 favor^ \u2014 -allege enough \u201ccircumstantial evidence of ... recklessness\u201d to raise a strong inference of scienter. <em>ECA &amp; Local 134 IBEW Joint Pension Trust v. JP Morgan Chase Co., </em>553 F.3d 187, 198 (2d Cir.2009). The complaint therefore satisfies the \u201cheightened pleading requirements\u201d of a securities fraud claim, <em>ATSI Commc\u2019ns, </em>493 F.3d at 99, and \u201cthe inference of scienter [is] cogent and at least as compelling as any opposing inference one could, draw from the facts alleged.\u201d <em>Tellabs, </em>551 U.S. at 324, 127 S.Ct. 2499; <em>see also Ganino v. Citizens Utils. Co., </em>228 F.3d 154, 169 (2d Cir.2000) (stating that \u201cgreat specificity\u201d is not required for allegations of scienter).</p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\">C. <em>Trellus\u2019s Claims and the Statute of Limitations</em></p>\n<p id=\"Aqm\">Macquarie also repeats its argument previously set forth in this litigation that Section 11 and 12 claims by Trellus Management Company LLC (\u201cTrellus\u201d) are time-barred. <em>(See, e.g., </em>ECF Nos. 211, 317, 326; Hr\u2019g Tr. Mar. 10, 2014.) For the reasons set forth below, this Court disagrees.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">1. <em>Procedural history</em></p>\n<p id=\"ApQ\">The Court assumes familiarity with the unusual procedural history of this litigation. On May 13, 2013, Trellus moved to intervene in this action. (ECF No. 176.) On October 1, 2013, the Court granted the underwriters\u2019 motion for summary judgment; it ruled, <em>inter alia, </em>that named plaintiff Thomas Rosenberger lacked standing due to his inability to trace the shares he purchased to the December 2010 offering. (ECF No. 263 at 13-19.) Accordingly, the Court dismissed the claims against the underwriter defendants \u201cfor lack of subject matter jurisdiction.\u201d (ECF No. 305.) In the October 2013 opinion, the Court also denied Trellus\u2019s motion to intervene as time-barred under the statute of limitations, and ruled that Trellus could not benefit from tolling under <em>American Pipe &amp; Construction Co. v. Utah, 414 U.S. </em>538, 94 S.Ct. 756, 38 L.Ed.2d 713 (1974), due to a lack of subject matter jurisdiction over Rosenberger\u2019s claims at the outset of the action. (ECF No. 263 at 23-32.) The Court also ruled that Trellus\u2019s motion was untimely based on a four-factor test weighing the equities in favor and against intervention. Trellus appealed that ruling. (ECF No. 272.)</p>\n<p id=\"b314-8\">On February 4, 2014, after Macquarie produced the Kroll report in discovery, Trellus moved pursuant to Rule 62.1(a)(3) for an indicative ruling that this Court would grant a Rule 60(b) motion to vacate its earlier denial of Trellus\u2019s intervention motion and would permit Trellus to intervene. (ECF Nos. 288, 289.) On February 21, 2014, the Court granted the Rule 62.1(a)(3) motion. (ECF No. 305.) On March 18, 2014, after further briefing on the issue, the Court reaffirmed that it was prepared to allow Trellus to assert claims as a party plaintiff under several Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. (ECF No. 331.) On April 2, 2014, the Second Circuit remanded the appeal to this Court. (ECF No. 343.) On April 7, 2014, the Court granted Trellus\u2019s Rule 60(b) motion and allowed it to enter as a party plaintiff. (ECF No. 347.).</p>\n<p id=\"b314-9\">Macquarie argues that the Court should not have allowed Trellus to intervene in this action. It maintains that Trellus\u2019s claims remain time-barred notwithstanding the production of the Kroll report because, when Trellus moved to intervene in May 2013, the applicable statute of limitations had already expired, and <em>American Pipe </em>tolling was unavailable. The Court agrees with Macquarie that the equitable factors involved in determining <em>timeliness </em>do not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>relate to the question of whether a complaint is <em>time-barred </em>due to the statute of limitations. <em>See MasterCard Int\u2019l Inc. v. Visa Int\u2019l Serv. Ass\u2019n, Inc., </em>471 F.3d 377, 390 (2d Cir.2006). The Court also does not revisit its earlier determination that <em>American Pipe </em>tolling is unavailable under these circumstances. Furthermore, the Court is mindful of the Second Circuit\u2019s recent holding that \u201cthe Rule 15(c) \u2018relation back\u2019 doctrine does not permit members of a putative class, who are not named parties, to intervene in the class action as named parties in order to revive claims that were dismissed from the class complaint for want of jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Police &amp; Fire Ret. Sys. of City of Detroit v. IndyMac MBS, Inc., </em>721 F.3d 95, 110 (2d Cir.2013).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">Nonetheless, the doctrine of equitable tolling provides a basis for tolling the statute of limitations and either granting Trel-lus\u2019s motion to intervene under Rule 24 or substituting Trellus for Rosenberger as plaintiff under Rules 15 and 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">2. <em>Equitable tolling</em></p>\n<p id=\"Amd\">\u201cEquitable tolling is a doctrine that permits courts to extend a statute of limitations on a case-by-case basis to prevent inequity.\u201d <em>Warren v. Garvin, </em>219 F.3d 111, 113 (2d Cir.2000); <em>see also Irwin v. Dep\u2019t of Veterans Affairs, </em>498 U.S. 89, 95, 111 S.Ct. 453, 112 L.Ed.2d 435 (1990); <em>IndyMac, </em>721 F.3d at 108 (\u201cJudicial power to toll statutes of limitations arises from an exercise of a court\u2019s equity powers, traditionally used to relieve hardships which, from time to time, arise from a hard and fast adherence to more absolute legal rules.\u201d) (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cEquitable tolling requires a party to pass with reasonable diligence through the period it seeks to have tolled.\u201d <em>Johnson v. Nyack Hosp., </em>86 F.3d 8, 12 (2d Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b315-9\">For the reasons set forth in the Court\u2019s prior orders, this case presents unusual circumstances that warrant equitable tolling. On April 15, 2011 \u2014 one week after the Shanxi transfer was revealed\u2014 Harriet Goldstein filed the first complaint in this action on behalf of herself and other purchasers of Puda securities pursuant to or traceable to Puda\u2019s December 2010 offering; on the face of the complaint, it appeared that she could trace her shares to the December 2010 offering. (ECF No. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 39, 52.) Trellus became aware of the lawsuit within a month of its filing, and contacted plaintiffs\u2019 lead counsel on January 6, 2012. (ECF No. 263 at 21.) On February 9, 2012, Thomas Rosenberger filed the operative complaint, which alleged that he purchased shares pursuant to or traceable to the offering and thus had standing. <em>(Id. </em>at 22.) In June 2012, Trel-lus and plaintiffs\u2019 counsel again discussed the status of the lawsuit. <em>(Id.) </em>On May 13, 2013, Trellus then moved to intervene, before the underwriters filed motions for summary judgment and before the Court dismissed Rosenberger\u2019s claims for lack of standing. (ECF Nos. 176,188, 263.)</p>\n<p id=\"b315-10\">Based on the complaints of which Trel-lus was aware, it was reasonable to believe that the plaintiffs had standing to repre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>sent a class including Trellus and other investors. Trellus also acted diligently in following up with plaintiffs\u2019 counsel to discuss the lawsuit. Furthermore, although Trellus moved to intervene after the statute of limitations on its claims in fact expired, Trellus could reasonably believe that plaintiffs had standing and that Trel-lus could benefit from <em>American Pipe </em>tolling. Trellus thus acted with \u201creasonable diligence through the period it seeks to have tolled,\u201d and can benefit from equitable tolling. <em>Johnson, </em>86 F.3d at 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\">Because equitable tolling applies to the statute of limitations in this matter, Trel-lus may intervene in this action pursuant to Rule 24. As the Court previously explained in its orders of February 21 and April 7, 2014 (ECF Nos. 305, 347), the production of the Kroll report increases the \u201cprejudice to [the] applicant if the motion [for intervention were] denied,\u201d and presents \u201cunusual circumstances militating for ... a finding of timeliness.\u201d <em>MasterCard, </em>471 F.3d at 390.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">The Court may alternatively substitute Trellus as plaintiff pursuant to Rules 15 and 21. Under Rule 21, \u201con its own, the court may at any time, on just terms, add or drop a party.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 21. .Under Rule 15, the \u201ccourt should freely give leave [to amend the complaint] when justice so requires.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 15. The Court\u2019s discretion in this regard \u201cencompasses both whether to permit substantive amendments of plaintiffs\u2019 claims and allegations, as well as whether to permit the joinder of additional plaintiffs.\u201d <em>In re Initial Public Offering Sec. Litig., </em>224 F.R.D. 550, 551 (S.D.N.Y.2004). Even where the statute of limitations has run on a putative plaintiffs claims, equitable tolling may nonetheless permit the Court to substitute a plaintiff. <em>See In re Initial Public Offering Sec. Litig., </em>Nos. 21-mc-92, 01-cv-9741, 01-cv-10899 (SAS), 2004 WL 3015304, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 27, 2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b316-9\">For these reasons, Trellus\u2019s claims are not time-barred under the doctrine of equitable tolling.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-10\">D. <em>Trellus\u2019s Standing With Respect to Macquarie Under Section 12</em></p>\n<p id=\"b316-11\">Finally, Macquarie argues that Trellus lacks standing to assert a Section 12 claim against it. Section 12(a)(2) provides that any \u201cperson who ... offers or sells a security ... by means of a prospectus .... which includes an untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a material fact ... shall be liable ... to the person purchasing such security from him.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77i. Thus, Macquarie argues that a purchaser in a public offering can sue only his statutory seller \u2014 the person who either sold the securities directly to him or solicited his purchase and was \u201cmotivated at least in part by a desire to serve [its] own financial interests or those of the securities owner.\u201d <em>Pinter v. Dahl, </em>486 U.S. 622, 642, 108 S.Ct. 2063, 100 L.Ed.2d 658 (1988). The complaint alleges that Trellus purchased December offering shares not from Macquarie, but rather from Brean Murray. <em>(See </em>Compl. \u00b642.)</p>\n<p id=\"b316-12\">Nonetheless, Trellus has standing under Section 12 to assert claims against Macquarie. Trellus alleges that Macquar-ie prepared and disseminated the December 2010 offering materials, prominently displayed its name on the prospectus, received financial benefits in connection with the offering, and served as a representative for Brean Murray. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b656, 121, 154.)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Macquarie\u2019s direct participation in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>preparing the offering materials and soliciting the purchase of Puda shares by Trellus makes it a statutory seller under Section 12. <em>See Pinter, </em>486 U.S. at 642, 108 S.Ct. 2063; <em>Capri v. Murphy, </em>856 F.2d 473, 478 (2d Cir.1988) (finding that plaintiffs could state a Section 12 claim against partners who \u201ccontemplated and authorized\u201d a transaction). Trellus therefore has standing against Macquarie under Section 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">TV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">For the reasons set forth above, the underwriters\u2019 motions to dismiss the mplaint \u00e1re DENIED. The Clerk of Court shall terminate the motions at ECF Nos. 370 and 373. The parties shall confer and submit a proposed schedule' for the resolution of this matter within 10 days, or no later than Thursday, July 24, 2014.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-7\">, SO ORDERED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b311-7\">. Macquarie also cites the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Halliburton Co. v. Erica P. John Fund, Inc., </em>for the principle that Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 liability should not be extended \u201cto entirely new categories of defendants who themselves had not made any material, public misrepresentation.\u201d - U.S. -, 134 S.Ct. 2398, 2403; 189 L.Ed.2d 339 (2014). <em>Halliburton </em>did not, however, disturb the Supreme Court's prior statements in <em>Janus </em>that \u201cthe maker of a statement is the person or entity with ultimate authority over <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>the statement, including its content and whether and how to communicate it,\u201d and that \"attribution within a statement or implicit from surrounding circumstances is strong evidence that a statement was made by \u2014 and only by \u2014 the party to whom it is attributed.\u201d 131 S.Ct. at 2302. Based on the well-pleaded allegations of the complaint, the underwriters fall within the definition of \"maker\u201d set forth in <em>Janus.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b315-7\">. The Second Circuit in <em>IndyMac </em>faced the question whether the Rule 15(c) \u201crelation back\" doctrine applied to make claims timely notwithstanding the three-year statute of repose, rather than the one-year statute of limitations. 721 F.3d at 110. The Second Circuit noted that, in contrast to the statute of limitations, application of equitable tolling to the \u201cthree-year repose period is barred by <em>Lampf </em>which states that equitable 'tolling principles do not apply to that period.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 109 (quoting <em>Lampf, Pleva, Lipkind, Prupis &amp; Petigrow v. Gilbertson, </em>501 U.S. 350, 363, 111 S.Ct. 2773, 115 L.Ed.2d 321 (1991)). <em>In-dyMac </em>thus does not bar the application of equitable tolling to the one-year statute of limitations.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b316-6\">. Plaintiff also cites deposition testimony indicating that Macquarie sent a representative with Zhao to meet with Trellus. (Crowell Decl. Ex. 3, at 84:10-85:10 (\u201cI think there was a banker from Macquarie ... present.\u201d), ECF No. 388.) Plaintiffs provided this depo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>sition testimony as an exhibit to their opposition to Macquarie's motion to dismiss. <em>(See id.) </em>The testimony is therefore outside the four corners of the complaint and does not appear to be the type of public filing of which the Court may take judicial notice. The cases that plaintiffs cite are not to the contrary. <em>See Blue Tree Hotels Inv. (Can.) Ltd. v. Starwood Hotels &amp; Resorts Worldwide, Inc., </em>369 F.3d 212 (2d Cir.2004) (\"[W]e may also look to public records, including complaints filed in state court, in deciding a motion to dismiss.\u201d); <em>Kramer v. Time Warner Inc., </em>937 F.2d 767, 774 (2d Cir.1991) (relying on \u201cpublic documents\u201d filed with the SEC in deciding a motion to dismiss). <em>But see Cortec Indus., Inc. v. Sum Holding L.P., </em>949 F.2d 42, 48 (2d Cir.1991) (explaining that \"the problem that arises when a court reviews statements extraneous to a complaint generally is the lack of notice to the [party] that they may be so considered,\u201d and affirming a district court\u2019s decision to consider non-public documents in deciding a motion to dismiss). In any event, the deposition testimony is not necessary to this Court\u2019s finding that Macquarie was a statutory seller within the meaning of Section 12.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
