L. c. 266, \u00a7 14<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>); (2) assault and battery by means of a dangerous <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>weapon; and (3) attempted armed robbery and assault while masked. Each of them objected (a) to the failure of the trial judge at their trial on November 7 through 9,1979, to \u00e9nter a required finding of not guilty (Mass. R. Crim. P. 25 [1979], 378 Mass. 896 [1979]), and (b) to a portion of the judge\u2019s charge. See note 3, <em>infra. </em>Each objection related only to the indictment under \u00a7 14. Labare and Tatro were each sentenced to a term of not more than twelve years nor less than ten years on the armed burglary charge. From these sentences they each appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">From the somewhat confused evidence, the jury could have made the following findings. On the evening of May 24, 1979, Labare, Tatro, Donald Pierce, and Barry Woodward were drinking in a bar. In the late evening, they all went to Pierce\u2019s house in Warren. One of them had learned that one Richard Albert had sold his automobile that day and had about $1,500 in his possession. On Tatro\u2019s suggestion, the four \u201cdecided to go over . . . and hit\u201d Albert. They \u201cgot a knife\u201d and cut up four nylon stockings to be used as masks. The four in the early morning hours then left for Albert\u2019s apartment in Ware. Linda LaPlante and her two sons lived in Albert\u2019s apartment. Because Albert and LaPlante knew Tatro and Pierce, the latter two remained at the bottom of the stairs leading to the apartment. Labare and Woodward, wearing the stocking masks, went upstairs. Woodward knocked on the door and kept knocking when there was no answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">LaPlante had been asleep when she heard the knocking. She asked, \u201cWho is it?\u201d The answer was, \u201cAl.\u201d LaPlante asked, \u201cAl who?\u201d, which was answered \u201cAllen.\u201d LaPlante then said, \u201cAllen who? I\u2019m not going to answer this door until you tell me who.\u201d \u201c[S]omeone in the background\u201d said, \u201cGerry.\u201d LaPlante testified that \u201cI had a brother [named] Gerry, so I opened the door.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b396-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>Woodward and Labare then \u201cpushed . . . [their] way in.\u201d Labare \u201cput the knife to . . . [LaPlante\u2019s] stomach and she started to scream, called to her boyfriend,\u201d Albert. Labare then \u201cwent in the bedroom where her boyfriend was,\u201d and told Albert, \u201cI want the money.\u201d Albert, by then also armed with a knife, said he \u201cdidn\u2019t have any.\u201d At this point, LaPlante managed to \u201cpush\u201d Woodward out the door. She locked him out, leaving Labare locked inside. She then ran to the back door and screamed to a neighbor to call the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">Woodward joined Tatro and Pierce. The three ran across the street, and one of Albert\u2019s neighbors chased them out of his yard. Tatro told Woodward to go back and get Labare. The three separated, but were soon apprehended together by the Ware police near Tatro\u2019s parked automobile.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">At some point, Labare also left the apartment. A police officer later saw Labare running down a street nearby, staggering, and thought Labare was drunk. The officer found a \u201cdagger\u201d and a \u201cknife\u201d in Labare\u2019s pocket.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-7\">The defendants (by their objections to the denial of a required finding and to the charge) present really only a single issue, viz., whether, on the essentially undisputed facts, there was a \u201cbreaking\u201d of the apartment within the meaning of G. L. c. 266, \u00a7 14 (n.l). The defendants contend that what is sometimes referred to by the text writers as a \u201cconstructive breaking\u201d has not been a part of the law of Massachusetts. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-8\">The portion of the trial judge\u2019s charge to which objection was made appears in the margin.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The trial transcript in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>dicates that the judge thought that a \u201cconstructive breaking\u201d constituted a \u201cbreaking\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 14 (note 1, <em>supra), </em>and that this view appears to be at least one reason for his denying the motion for a required finding of not guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">The Massachusetts case closest to the present one is <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lowrey, </em>158 Mass. 18 (1893), an opinion by Mr. Justice Holmes. In that case, one count of an indictment charged two defendants with breaking and entering a building and stealing therein. Lowrey\u2019s codefendant, Johnson, \u201cin pursuance of a preconcerted scheme\u201d made \u201ca pretense of a wish to purchase an article,\u201d and persuaded the night clerk of a drug store \u201cto let him into the company\u2019s shop . . . about midnight.\u201d The clerk went to the cellar to procure the article sought by Johnson. \u201cJohnson unbolted the door . . . and let in . . . Lowrey, who concealed himself and remained behind when Johnson left, and afterwards \u201ccommitted a theft.\u201d The opinion then said (at 19): \u201cIt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>was not necessary that Lowrey should have touched the door if he procured himself to be let in by an accomplice and entered with felonious intent. He might have been convicted, even if the hand which he made use of was innocent, as in case of a servant or constable.\u201d The opinion then relies upon several decisions and other authorities which state the principle of \u201cconstructive breaking.\u201d Among authorities so cited were <em>LeMott\u2019s case, </em>J. Kel. 42 (1,664), 89 Eng. Rep. 1073, and 4 Blackstone, Commentaries 226-227 (8th ed. 1778). The opinion then proceeds. \u201cThe accomplice inside the house is guilty of the same offence . . . .\u201d The facts in the <em>Lowrey </em>case may not have required the adoption in that case of the doctrine of \u201cconstructive breaking.\u201d The circumstances leading to the conviction of both defendants, however, viewed as a whole, involved sufficient elements of trickery and subterfuge to make it natural for the court to rely upon the authorities which support the doctrine. The case must be viewed as recognition of the doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">Blackstone\u2019s Commentaries reasonably may be said to represent this aspect of the common law as it existed at and just after the American Revolution. Of burglary, Blackstone wrote, 4 Blackstone, Commentaries 226-227 (8th ed. 1778), \u201cAs to the manner of committing burglary: there must be both \u00e1 breaking and an entry to complete it ... . There must <em>in general </em>be an actual breaking; not a mere legal <em>clausum fregit </em>(by leaping over invisible ideal boundaries, which may constitute a civil trespass) but a substantial and forcible irruption. As at least by breaking, or taking out the glass of, or otherwise opening, a window; picking a lock, or opening it with a key; nay, by lifting up the latch of a door, or unloosing any other fastening which the owner has provided. But if a person leaves his doors or windows open, it is his own folly and negligence, and if a man enters therein, it is no burglary: yet, if he afterwards unlocks an inner or chamber door, it is so. But to come down a chimney is held a burglarious entry; for that is as much closed, as the nature of things will permit. <em>So also to knock at a door, and upon opening it to rush in with a felonious intent; or, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number><em>under pretence of taking lodgings, to fall upon the landlord and rob him; or to procure a constable to gain admittance, in order to search for traitors, and then to bind the constable and rob the house-, </em>all the entries have been adjudged burglarious, though there was no actual breaking: for the law will not suffer itself to be trifled with by such evasions, especially under the cloke [sic] of legal process. And so, if a servant open and enters his master\u2019s chamber door with a felonious design; or if any other person lodging in the same house, or in a public inn, opens and enters another\u2019s door, with such evil intent; it is burglary .... [I]t is universally agreed, that there must be both a breaking, either in fact <em>or by implication, </em>and also an entry, in order to complete the burglary\u201d (emphasis supplied). In <em>LeMott\u2019s case, </em>J. Kel. 42 (1664), in a situation closely like the present case, entrance obtained by \u201ca false pretence\u201d was held to constitute burglary.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Modern American authorities to this effect are collected in 3 Torcia, Wharton\u2019s Criminal Law \u00a7 330 (14th ed. 1980); Perkins, Criminal Law 192-198 (2d ed. 1969); La Fave &amp; Scott, Criminal Law \u00a7 96, at 708-709 (1972).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">The cases are consistent with the purpose of a burglary prosecution. Justice Whittemore suggested, in <em>Common</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number><em>wealth </em>v. <em>Tilley, </em>355 Mass. 507, 509 (1969), that the purpose is to protect \u201cthe security of the house.\u201d That security, of course, is just as much invaded by an entry by trickery as by an actual \u201cbreak\u201d by the invader himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">Counsel for the defendants contend that in Massachusetts burglary has been or has now become wholly a statutory offense and that the doctrine of constructive breaking may not be considered as incorporated in the statute. We do not accept this contention. Prior to the Revolution, there were various statutory forms of the offense, all of which referred to \u201cbreaking\u201d or \u201cbreaking up\u201d of a dwelling or other building or made it a crime to \u201cbreak and enter.\u201d See Colonial Laws of 1642 at 13 (City of Boston reprint, 1887); Prov. Laws, St. 1692-1693, c. 18, \u00a7 4; St. 1715-1716, c. 1. No specification of what constituted a \u201cbreak\u201d or \u201cbreaking\u201d appears in the language of any of these statutes. After the Revolution, with the enactment of St. 1784, c. 48, the offense was made capital and was described, \u201cif any person shall in the night time <em>break </em>and enter any dwelling house, with intent to . . . rob, steal etc.\u201d (emphasis supplied). See St. 1805, c. 101, \u00a7 1, where the language with respect to the offense now found in G. L. c. 266, \u00a7 14 (note 1, <em>supra), </em>was \u201cshall in the night time, break a dwelling house.\u201d Later codifications also have used the words \u201cbreak and enter,\u201d or closely similar words, without defining their meaning. Rev. Sts. (1836) c. 126, \u00a7 9. Gen. Sts. (1860) c. 161, \u00a7 10. Pub. Sts. (1882) c. 203, \u00a7 10. R.L. (1902) c. 208, \u00a7 14. See for a discussion of some of the legislative history of \u00a7 14 and related sections, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Swahn, </em>5 Mass. App. Ct. 642 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">The applicable principles of statutory construction are clear. General Laws c. 4, \u00a7 6, Third, reads: \u201cWords and phrases shall be construed according to the common and approved usage of the language; but technical words and phrases and <em>such others as may have acquired a peculiar and appropriate meaning in law </em>shall be construed and understood according to such meaning\u201d (emphasis supplied). See Part II, c. 6, art. 6, of the Massachusetts Constitution; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number><em>Crocker </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>208 Mass. 162, 166 et seq. (1911). A statute is not to be construed to repeal the common law, \u201cunless the intent to alter it is clearly expressed.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Knapp, </em>9 Pick. 495, 514 (1830). No such intention can be reasonably inferred from the language of \u00a7 14 and its predecessors. This is true even though penal statutes are to be strictly construed. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Conway, </em>2 Mass. App. Ct. 547, 552-553 (1974), and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">We hold that the word \u201cbreaks\u201d as it appears in \u00a7 14 (note 2, <em>supra) </em>(as well as other statutory forms of that word), had acquired, prior to the Revolution, and at all times since has had, the common law meaning, including the doctrine of \u201cconstructive breaking.\u201d That meaning has not been changed or enlarged by any recent enactment.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Thus there has been in this case no ex post facto application of \u00a7 14, by interpreting \u201cbreaks\u201d as including a constructive breaking. Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>380 Mass. 1, 16 n.22 (1980); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lewis, </em>381 Mass. 411, 415-418 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">The defendants also in effect suggest that G. L. c. 266, \u00a7\u00a717 and 18 (making criminal an entry in the nighttime without breaking), render unnecessary an interpretation of \u201cbreaks\u201d in \u00a7 14 (note 2, <em>supra) </em>as including a common law constructive breaking. We interpret \u00a7\u00a717 and 18 as defining lesser offenses applicable where there is no evidence of any form of breaking, actual or constructive.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-7\">The statute (\u00a7 14), as we interpret it, merely embodies, in respects here pertinent, the content of the applicable eom<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>mon law. There is no ambiguity about what \u201cbreaks\u201d meant in the common law concerning burglary, and thus there is no ambiguity to resolve \u201cin favor of lenity.\u201d See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Crosscup, </em>369 Mass. 228, 234 (1975); <em>Rewis </em>v. <em>United States, </em>401 U.S. 808, 812 (1971); <em>Bifulco </em>v. <em>United States, </em>447 U.S. 381, 400-401 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">Tatro\u2019s counsel ingeniously suggests that an analogy to the present situation is presented by cases arising under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3109 (1976), holding that entries obtained by \u201cruse\u201d involve no \u201cbreaking\u201d in violation of that statute. <em>Sabbath v. United States, </em>391 U.S. 585, 589-590 n.5 (1968), where the court did not (n.7) purport to deal with entries obtained by \u201cruse.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Dohm, </em>597 F.2d 535, 537-538 (5th Cir.), cert. denied sub nom. <em>Rowen </em>v. <em>United States, 444 </em>U.S. 937 (1979). The different purposes of that statute (pertaining to forcible entries by officers to execute a search warrant) sufficiently distinguish decisions under it to make of slight assistance whatever analogy may exist between them and the well recognized and inclusive law definition of \u201cbreak\u201d with relation to the crime of burglary.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b394-17\">Section 14 (as amended by St. 1966, c. 330) reads: \u201cWhoever <em>breaks and enters </em>a dwelling house in the night time, with intent to commit a felony, or whoever, after having entered with such intent, br\u00e9ales such dwelling house in the night time, any person being then lawfully therein, and the offender being armed with a dangerous weapon at the time of such breaking or entry, or so arming himself in such house, or making an actual assault on a person lawfully therein, shall be punished by imprisonment in the state prison for life or for any term of not less than ten years. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>The sentence imposed upon a person who, after being convicted of any of-fence mentioned in this section, commits the like offence, or any other of the offences therein mentioned, shall not be suspended, nor shall he be placed on probation\u201d (emphasis supplied).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b396-9\">The charge relating to \u201cconstructive breaking\u201d reads: \u201cNow the term breaking and entering . . . has a technical meaning. To constitute a breaking it\u2019s not necessary that a door or window be forced or actually smashed or broken in any way .... It\u2019s sufficient if a closed door or window is opened, even though that door or window is unlocked. Just opened by someone unauthorized to do so is a breaking within the meaning of the law . : . . [Tjhere was no evidence that . . . Labare, or any defendant, actually opened any door or any window in order to gain access to the apartment. The evidence most favorable to the Commonwealth ... is that in response to some language that was uttered out<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>side the door Miss LaPlante opened the door herself and they then stepped in.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">\u201cNow to constitute a breaking there has to be some movement, some movement of some object, like the opening of a door. Just walking through an open doorway is not a breaking.... [It should be noted that this statement and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Strupney, </em>105 Mass. 588, 590 (1870), have been somewhat affected by <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tilley, </em>355 Mass. 507, 508 (1969).] [Tjhere is such a thing as constructive breaking. It\u2019s to be distinguished from an actual breaking. An actual breaking would be the opening of a door by the defendant himself. But a constructive breaking is also a breaking within the meaning of the law. And a constructive breaking is one that is accomplished by trick or threat.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-8\">\u201cIf Linda LaPlante opened the door herself but did so because she had been tricked, deliberately tricked by the Defendant, that would constitute a breaking within the meaning of the law. It would be a constructive breaking because it was accomplished by trick rather than by actual force .... [Tjhere\u2019s no evidence to justify finding an actual breaking .... [I]f you\u2019re satisfied beyond any reasonable doubt that. . . Labare gained access to that apartment by trick, by deliberate trick, even though Miss LaPlante opened the door herself, then you would be warranted in finding that that element of this . . . crime has been satisfied. If. . . you have a reasonable doubt . . . whether any such trick was employed, then you must resolve that doubt in favor of the defendant, and you would then be required to return a verdict of not guilty on this indictment.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b399-6\">In the 1664 decision, at 42, the reporter stated the facts: \u201cThieves came with intent to Rob . . . [the victim] and finding the Door lockt up, pretending they came to speak with him, and thereupon a Maid Servant opened the Door and they came in and Rob\u2019d him, and this being in the Nighttime, this was adjudged burglary ... for their Intention being to Rob, and getting the Door open by a false pretence, . . . they were guilty of Eurglary, though they did not actually break the House, for this was in Law an actual breaking, being obtained by fraud to have the Door opened\u201d (spelling &amp; capitalization follow official report).

Nolan, Criminal Law \u00a7 402, at 234 (1976). It should be noted that the Model Penal Code \u00a7 22.1 (1980), proposes a definition of burglary differing in various respects from the common law crime. The discussion of that section, however, recognizes (at 69) that, at common law, \u201cEntries accomplished by intimidations, trick, or collusion with a servant were . . . held to be breakings.\u201d See Note, 100 U. Pa. L. Rev. 411, 412 (1951).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b401-8\"> We perceive nothing to alter our view in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sitko, </em>372 Mass. 305, 310-311 (1977). There a defendant had entered business premises disguised as a telephone lineman. He had observed the alarm system, which a few days afterward was found to have been neutralized. He was convicted under an indictment charging him as accessory before the fact to the crime of breaking and entering. It could have been inferred that he had at least advised those persons, who later entered to steal, how to by-pass the alarm system. No consideration was necessary or was given concerning whether he could have been charged more directly with breaking and entering.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
