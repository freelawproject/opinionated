L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14, of a decision of the DPW denying the plaintiff\u2019s eligibility for Medicaid payments, the trial judge upheld the DPW and refused to order it to follow the calculations prescribed by the 1976 directive which was contained in HHS\u2019 Medical Assistance Manual.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> He ruled that the 1976 provision \u201ccontemplated a material and substantial change from existing policy\u201d and was \u201cof no effect because it was not promulgated pursuant to the notice and comment provisions\u201d of the Administrative Procedure Act (A.P.A.), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 553 (1976). For the reasons stated in this opinion, we agree with the trial judge that the provision of the 1976 manual is not binding on the DPW.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">1. <em>The statutory and regulatory provisions. </em>Before discussing the 1974 and 1976 directives of HHS, we shall examine briefly the general framework of Medicaid and the specific statute and regulations which the two directives implement. Medicaid is a Federal-State cooperative program which was created in 1965 under Title XIX of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1396 et seq. (1976 and Supp. III 1979). Participation by the States in the program is entirely optional, but once a State chooses to participate, it must comply with the requirements of Title XIX. <em>Harris </em>v. <em>McRae, </em>448 U.S. 297, 301 (1980). Participating States submit their plans<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> for approval to HHS (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1316 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>[a][l] [1976]), and if approved, the Federal government will pay a specified percentage of \u201cthe total amount expended ... as medical assistance under the State plan.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396b(a)(1) (1976). <em>Harris </em>v. <em>McRae, supra </em>at 308. A State plan will be approved if it complies with the applicable \u201cstatutes and regulations.\u201d 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 201.3(d) (1980).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">A State which adopts a Medicaid program must provide assistance to the group referred to in the regulations as the categorically needy<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a[a][10][A] [1976]), and may also provide benefits to a group known as the medically needy.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a(a)(10)(C) (1976). Massachusetts has elected to include both groups. General Laws c. 118E, \u00a7 1. See generally <em>Moe </em>v. <em>Secretary of Admn. &amp; Fin., </em>382 Mass. 629, 633-634 (1981). The medically needy have income and resources above the limits of the categorically needy, and only receive benefits after they have incurred medical expenses which reduce their income below a prescribed level. The determination of that reduction or \u201cspend down\u201d is the core of the present dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">The time period for computing income is prescribed by regulation. DPW \u201cmust use a prospective period of not more than six months to compute income.\u201d 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 435.831(a) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>(1979). However, neither the statute, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a (a) (17) (1976),<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> nor the regulations promulgated thereunder specify the time period during which medical expenses must be incurred in order to reduce income of a given period. In this connection, we note that there are two sets of regulations which we consider. Although the parties have not suggested that the current regulations which were first issued in 1978 do not apply to the plaintiffs claim, we assume, without deciding, that the regulations in force at the time of the eligibility period under dispute are applicable to that claim.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> For purposes of declaratory (and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>injunctive) relief, however, we look to the current regulations.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> As will become evident in the course of this opinion, we consider that the regulations in effect both in 1977 and in 1978 are consistent with the position of the DPW on \u201cspend down\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">2. <em>The 1974 directive and the 1976 manual instruction. </em>On August 20, 1974, HHS issued a directive requiring States to submit a form, \u201cAttachment 2.6-C,\u201d if their State plans included the medically needy. The directive contained an explanation of the various items on the form including a discussion of the computation of excess income and medical expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">An examination of the relevant portions of the 1974 HHS directive leads us to conclude, as did the trial judge, that the present method used by the DPW to compute spend down was \u201cspecifically authorized\u201d by the 1974 directive.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>find it unnecessary to give a detailed explanation of the DPW method and merely note that it provides that excess income for a given period (six months forward and three months back) can only be offset by medical expenses incurred during the same period. We also conclude that the Massachusetts State plan, as last approved by HHS in 1978, contemplated that method of spend down.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">It does not appear in the record whether the 1974 directive was part of the medical assistance manual of HHS, but it is clear that the \u201cAction Transmittal\u201d of July 8, 1976, became \u00a7 4-30-30 of the manual. The manual was first issued to participating States in 1971, and is described therein as an \u201cofficial medium by which the Medical Services Administration issues guides and procedures to States.\u201d It \u201cclarifies, explains, and expands upon the meaning of the Regulations and the provisions upon which they are based.\u201d In a paragraph headed \u201cRelationship to Regulations,\u201d the following statement is made: \u201cThe material contained in this Manual is consistent with the Regulations on the subjects and <em>contains no new or different requirements from those in the Regulations\u201d </em>(emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">\u201cAction Transmittal\u201d of July 8, 1976, containing \u00a7 4-30-30, was sent to the States as a new insert for the manual and was not published in accordance with 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 552(a)(1) and 553(b) (1976) of the A.P.A. Section 4-30-30 provides, with certain qualifications not here ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>plicable, that \u201cany medical expenses which are the current liability of the applicant shall be considered including: (1) unpaid expenses <em>incurred at any time </em>prior to the date of application, providing the applicant remains liable for payment\u201d (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">We agree with the trial judge that this provision \u201cmaterially affects Massachusetts\u2019 liability under its Medicaid plan.\u201d Section 4-30-30 prohibits the DPW from computing spend down under the method sanctioned by the 1974 directive. Medical expenses whenever incurred must be used to reduce income.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">3. <em>Effect of the 1976 manual provision. </em>The DPW concedes that HHS has the delegated legislative power under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1302 and 1396a (a)(17) (1976 and Supp. III 1979), see note 8, <em>supra, </em>to fill the interstices of the statute by properly promulgated regulations.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Such regulations could set a specific time or even an unlimited time period during which incurred medical expenses could be used to reduce income. We assume that such regulations would be binding on the DPW. However, the Secretary has chosen not to treat the spend down as a \u201clegislative-type rule\u201d, see <em>Morton </em>v. <em>Ruiz, </em>415 U.S. 199, 236 (1974), and has, as we have seen, left the regulations silent on the time when medical expenses must be incurred in order to be considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-7\">The plaintiff, as does HHS,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> claims that although HHS did not issue its directive as a regulation pursuant to \u00a7 553, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>HHS was not required to do so. The plaintiff relies on 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 553 (b)(A) (1976), which exempts \u201cinterpretative rules\u201d from the operation of \u00a7 553, and urges that \u00a7 4-30-30 is an interpretive rule. She claims that the provision, even if not binding, is entitled to great weight as a directive of the agency administering the statute. The DPW on the other hand, claims that the \u201cinterpretive\u201d label placed on the manual provision by HHS is not dispositive, that the provision is a change from prior practice and has substantial impact on the Commonwealth, and that in such circumstances it is not binding because it was not promulgated in accordance with the requirements of 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 553 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">The DPW\u2019s position was adopted by the trial court. There is considerable and persuasive authority that if a directive has substantial impact this fact, and not the label placed thereon by the agency, determines whether the safeguards of the A.P.A. are applicable. Courts adhering to this view characterize such a directive as a substantive or legislative rule subject to \u00a7 553.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Other courts do not attempt to distinguish between \u201cinterpretive\u201d (or procedural rules which are also exempt) and \u201csubstantive\u201d rules, but reach the same result by looking at the basic purpose of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>statutory requirements of \u00a7 553. They hold that, whatever the characterization, the exemption in \u00a7 553(b) (A) does not extend to rules which depart from existing practice and have a substantial impact on the persons regulated.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">These authorities and a number of variations thereon<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> show a judicial reluctance to allow an agency, a body which may be insulated from any political accountability, to impose binding rules which materially affect rights or liabilities without an opportunity to gain the benefit of the views of the parties affected. A similar reluctance by Congress led to the passage of \u00a7 553 of the A.P.A. Both are based on considerations of fairness to the parties affected as well as on the premise that a fully responsible and thoughtful decision can only be reached after consultation with or comment by interested persons. <em>Chamber of Commerce </em>v. <em>Occupational Safety </em>&amp; <em>Health </em>Admn., 636 F.2d 464, 470-471 (D.C. Cir. 1980). See <em>Saint Francis Memorial Hosp. </em>v. <em>Weinberger, </em>413 F. Supp. 323, 329 (N.D. Cal. 1976); <em>Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Assn. </em>v. <em>Finch, </em>307 F. Supp. 858, 864, 866, 868 (D. Del. 1970). See generally A Functional Approach to the Applicability of Section 553 of the Administrative Procedure Act to Agency Statements of Policy, 43 U. Chi. L. Rev. 430 (1976). The opportunity for comment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>is clearly appropriate here where the party affected is a State agency which itself has considerable expertise in assessing the financial impact of the provision on the State.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">In this case, however, we find it unnecessary to hold the provision invalid as applied to the DPW on the ground that it did not comply with A.P.A. requirements. This is so because even if we were to accept HHS\u2019 view that \u00a7 4-30-30 is interpretative, and were also to accept that it is not subject to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 553 (1976) despite its impact, we do not find the provision entitled to such deference as to be binding on the DPW. We may properly reach this conclusion because if a particular agency pronouncement may be lawfully issued without going through the procedure of notice and hearing required for a regulation, that pronouncement \u201cdoes not have the binding force attributable to a full-blown regulation.\u201d <em>Massachusetts Gen. Hosp. </em>v. <em>Rate Setting Commn., </em>371 Mass. 705, 707 (1977). <em>Cerro Metal Prod. </em>v. <em>Marshall, </em>620 F.2d 964, 981 (3d Cir. 1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">The weight to be accorded to an agency judgment \u201cwill depend upon the thoroughness evident in its consideration, the validity of its reasoning, its consistency with earlier and later pronouncements, and all those factors which give it power to persuade, if lacking power to control.\u201d <em>Skidmore </em>v. <em>Swift &amp; Co., </em>323 U.S. 134, 140 (1944). Judged by these criteria, \u00a7 4-30-30 can muster little strength. It is a new rule, not one of long standing. It precludes State procedures sanctioned by the prior 1974 directive. See <em>supra, </em>part 2. Moreover, it is not consistent with the avowed functions of the manual, which, as we noted earlier, specifically states that it contains no \u201cnew requirements from those in the regulations.\u201d If the first (1974) directive was, in accordance with the intent of the manual, merely a clarification of the regulations, the second, which requires a material change in DPW\u2019s procedures, cannot be passed off as con-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>taming \u201cno new requirements.\u201d Because of the inconsistency in HHS\u2019 position on spend down and because of the use of the manual in a manner contrary to its expressed purpose, we do not accord the 1976 provision \u201cthe weight normally given to\u201d an administrative interpretation. <em>Perry </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Corps. &amp; Taxn., </em>5 Mass. App. Ct. 780, 781 (1977). See <em>General Elec. Co. </em>v. <em>Gilbert, </em>429 U.S. 125, 141-145 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">In addition, HHS has given no indication of a thorough consideration of the implications of its policy change. To the contrary, the fact that the 1976 provision altered the prior rule without explanation and was adopted without any opportunity for comment by State agencies suggests that it was issued without full information as to its financial and other impact on such agencies. These are matters where the expertise of State officials would be most valuable to an informed judgment by HHS. Cf. <em>Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Assn. </em>v. <em>Finch, </em>307 F. Supp. at 866; <em>Saint Francis Memorial Hosp. </em>v. <em>Weinberger, </em>413 F. Supp. at 329.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">Nor does the 1976 \u201cinterpretation\u201d seem more persuasive than the one of 1974. In the absence of a reason to the contrary, it seems natural to use the same period for computing expenses and income. Neither the statute nor the regulations in effect in 1977 or in 1978 require the interpretation urged by the plaintiff; moreover, the propriety of the State putting a time limit on medical expenses seems authorized by the 1978 regulation. See note 10, <em>supra. </em>For these reasons, without passing on the wisdom of either of the two directives, we hold that the DPW is not bound to discard its previously authorized method and accept the rewritten position of HHS contained in the 1976 manual.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> See <em>Daughters of Miriam Center for the Aged </em>v. <em>Mathews, </em>590 F.2d 1250, 1263 (3d Cir. 1978); <em>Cerro Metal Prod. </em>v. <em>Marshall, </em>620 F.2d at 982.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b540-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>The judgment is to be modified to declare that DPW is not bound by the 1976 manual provision, and as so modified is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b529-15\"> The Department of Health, Education and Welfare was redesignated the Department of Health and Human Services.

The panel hearing this appeal asked the parties to submit briefs and also invited HHS to submit a brief as an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>amicus curiae, pursuant to Mass.R.A.P. 17, 365 Mass. 864 (1974), on the need or feasibility of HHS participation in this case. The parties argued that HHS was not a necessary party, and its participation would only cause delay. HHS, through its deputy regional attorney, in a letter responded that \u201cwe do not believe it is either necessary or feasible for HHS to participate\u201d in this litigation, and \u201cwe would respectfully decline\u201d the invitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-7\">The letter also states: \u201cAt the same time, however, we do believe that the position of HHS is before the court, insofar as relevant pages of our Medical Assistance Manual and correspondence from our Department have been introduced as exhibits in the litigation. Those materials continue to reflect the position of our department.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b536-8\"> E.g., <em>Joseph </em>v. <em>United States Civil Serv.

E.g., <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Butz, </em>550 F.2d 459, 462-463 (9th Cir. 1977). Other authorities suggest that where an agency has the substantive authority to issue binding regulations, the agency designation should be respected. However, this position still leaves open the question whether the regulation should, on principles of fairness, be promulgated so that interested parties have an opportunity to comment or influence the agency. 2 Davis, Administrative Law \u00a7 7.18 (2d ed. 1979).
