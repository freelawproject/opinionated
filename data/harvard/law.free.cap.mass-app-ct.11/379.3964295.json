L. c. 94C, \u00a7 34), the defendant was convicted of being present where heroin was illegally kept (G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 35). The defendant contends that he was convicted of an offense not charged in the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-15\">The jury could have found that on November 8, 1977, at 2:00 a.m. the police, armed with a search warrant, entered the apartment occupied by the defendant, his girl friend and her five children. In the course of a lengthy search, the police seized, among other things, a paper bag containing: a box of aluminum foil, a spoon inscribed with the name of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>a restaurant where the defendant worked, and a mortar and pestle each of which were found to have a residue of heroin.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">Immediately prior to closing arguments, the judge informed counsel that he intended to charge the jury \u201con any lesser included offense.\u201d In his charge, the judge told the jury, \u201cyou can bring back a verdict of guilty of a lesser included offense of being present at a place where heroin is kept or deposited,\u201d and he correctly charged on the elements of that offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">The defendant did not object to the instructions on the \u201clesser included offense,\u201d although he had excepted to the denial of his nonspecific motion for a directed verdict at the close of the evidence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Posttrial, the defendant moved to renew his motion for a directed verdict and added as a ground the claim that the offense of being present where heroin is kept is not a lesser included offense of possession of heroin, and that therefore his conviction cannot stand. He excepted to the denial of the motion as renewed.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-7\">A complaint which, as here, charges only a misdemeanor, not only charges the principal offense but also lesser included offenses, and a defendant may be convicted under such a complaint for a lesser included offense. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gosselin, </em>365 Mass. 116, 118-120 (1974). It has long been held that lesser included offenses are those necessarily included in the offense as charged. <em>Morey </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>108 Mass. 433, 434 (1871). By definition an offense which requires proof of an element different from, and in addition to, those constituting the claimed greater offense is not a lesser included offense. See <em>Kuklis </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>361 Mass. 302, 306-307 (1972); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>382 Mass. 387, 393 (1981). If the offenses are distinct at law, it is of no matter how nearly they may be related in fact.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Kuklis, supra </em>at 307. In this case the of<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>fense charged and the offense for which the defendant was convicted are similar in that they both involve connections with heroin. However, the connections differ sufficiently to distinguish the crimes. The offense of \u201cpossession,\u201d but not that of \u201cbeing present,\u201d requires proof of \u201cdominion or control.\u201d Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nichols, </em>4 Mass. App. Ct. 606, 613 (1976), with <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Buckley, </em>354 Mass. 508, 513 (1968). While \u201cdominion or control\u201d is often inferred from presence, presence is not an element of the offense. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mott, </em>2 Mass. App. Ct. 47, 53-54 (1974). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lee, </em>2 Mass. App. Ct. 700, 704 (1974). On the other hand, presence is the gravamen of the offense of \u201cbeing present.\u201d Therefore, we hold that \u201cbeing present\u201d is not a lesser included offense of \u201cpossession\u201d (see <em>Kuklis, supra </em>at 308; <em>People </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>271 Cal. App. 2d 60, 62 [1969]), and that the defendant was convicted of an offense of which he was not charged. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Maguire, </em>313 Mass. 669, 672 (1943).</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">The Commonwealth argues that the defendant waived any objection to this result when he failed to object to the instructions concerning the \u201clesser included offense.\u201d The Commonwealth contends that the defendant, not having objected to the instructions, and having gained the advantage of an acquittal on the charge of possession, possibly as the result of a compromise verdict on the supposed lesser offense, and in other words, \u201chaving tested the water,\u201d cannot withdraw and contest the conviction on the ground that he was improperly charged with the supposed lesser offense. It relies on <em>People </em>v. <em>Hensel, </em>233 Cal. App. 2d 834, cert. denied, 382 U.S. 942 (1965), to support this argument. We do not accept that contention. <em>Hensel </em>and its progeny were decided in light of the California procedure for amending indictments and complaints. That procedure is substantially more liberal in its allowance of such amendments than is the corresponding Massachusetts procedure. As a result, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>the California authority called to our attention is not particularly helpful. Compare G. L. c. 277, \u00a7 35A,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and Cal. Penal Code \u00a7 1009 (Deering). See, also, Note, Convictions of Unincluded Lesser Offenses: Informal Amendments and Plea Bargains, 25 Hastings L. J. 1075 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">We shall assume that the defendant\u2019s exceptions to the denials of his motion for a directed verdict, as first made and as renewed, were not sufficient as objections to the judge\u2019s instructions, and we shall reverse only if there is a \u201csubstantial risk of a miscarriage of justice.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Freeman, </em>352 Mass. 556, 564 (1967). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Franks, </em>365 Mass. 74, 76 (1974). We are satisfied that to be convicted of an offense not charged would certainly be a miscarriage of justice. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mahar, </em>16 Pick. 120, 120 (1834). Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Snow, </em>269 Mass. 598, 609-610 (1930); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bracy, </em>313 Mass. 121, 126 (1943). Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McKnight, </em>283 Mass. 35, 39 (1933).</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b406-7\">\n<em>Verdict set aside.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b406-8\">\n<em>Judgment for the defendant.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b404-8\"> The defendant also contests the denial of his motion for a directed verdict on the ground of insufficiency of the evidence.
