L. c. 266, \u00a7 17), and of two counts of rape (as newly defined in G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 22, as appearing in St. 1974, c. 474, \u00a7 1).</p>\n<p id=\"b26-9\">The defendant raises five claims of error. He argues (1) that the prosecutor\u2019s reference, in closing argument, to an alleged silence on the part of the defendant at the time he was arrested and confronted with the complainant, was improper; (2) that the prosecutor\u2019s additional comment, in closing argument, to the effect that once the complainant had recovered her stereo set, she could have \u201cdropped the complaint if she was not telling the truth\u201d about the rape, was also improper; (3) that the trial judge erred in excluding certain testimony under the \u201crape shield law,\u201d G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 21B; (4) that the judge\u2019s criticism of the defendant\u2019s trial counsel prejudiced the defendant\u2019s position in the eyes of the jury; and (5) that the evidence was insufficient to support a conviction of any of the offenses charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-10\">We agree with the defendant as to his first argument and hold that the prosecutor acted improperly in referring to the defendant\u2019s alleged silence at the time of his arrest and confrontation. Accordingly, we reverse the judgments of conviction and remand for a new trial.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b27-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>At trial, the prosecution\u2019s case consisted mainly of testimony by the complainant and the two police officers who arrested the defendant. As brought out in their testimony, the basic facts of the incident were as follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-5\">At the time of the incident, the complainant resided with her four children in an apartment on the third floor of a building at the Bromley Heath housing project in Jamaica Plain. She had lived there for about five years and knew most of the people in the building.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-6\">The complainant knew the defendant because he had previously come to her apartment to visit her sister, who had lived with the complainant until approximately a year before the incident. The complainant testified that the defendant had never come to the apartment since her sister had left, but that she had seen him around the neighborhood since that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-7\">On the afternoon of Saturday, March 10, 1979, the complainant was at home with her children. She testified that no one else had been there that day. At about 3:30 or 4:00 p.m., she heard a knock at the door. She did not know who was there but she went to the door and unlocked it. When the person outside pushed the door open, she saw that it was the defendant. He forced his way into the living room, put his arm around her throat from behind, and began choking her. He warned her not to scream. The defendant held her in that position for some time.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-8\">The complainant\u2019s children were in the bedroom watching television, and the defendant told her to bring the children and the television out into the living room. He released her, and she did so.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-9\">The defendant then led the complainant into the bedroom. He told her to take off her pants and underpants, which she did. The complainant testified that the defendant then \u201cput his mouth to . . . my vagina,\u201d and later \u201cinserted his penis in my vagina.\u201d Thereafter, the defendant came out of the bedroom, took the complainant\u2019s stereo set from the living room, and left the apartment with it.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-10\">The complainant then put her clothes back on and went down to the second floor apartment of Ruby Avinger, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>close friend of hers at that time. She told Avinger and her ten-year-old daughter Natalie what had happened, and Avinger called the police. The complainant and Avinger then went downstairs to try to find the defendant. On the stairs they ran into Milton Boyd, another neighbor, and had a brief conversation with him. They then proceeded toward another building in the housing project, where they believed the defendant was living.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-5\">At that point, two police officers arrived and the complainant told them what had happened and where they were going. The officers then proceeded to an apartment in a nearby building. There they found the defendant. Both officers drew their service revolvers. One of them instructed the defendant to put his hands on the wall of the entryway of the apartment and then patted him down for weapons. In the apartment the police found a stereo matching the description the complainant had given them.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-6\">The police brought the defendant and the stereo outside, where the complainant and Boyd were waiting. The complainant identified the defendant and the stereo. The police then placed the defendant in the cruiser and took him to the station. The complainant was subsequently taken to a hospital for examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-7\">The defendant\u2019s case consisted of testimony by Avinger, her daughter Natalie, and Boyd. Their testimony contradicted the complainant\u2019s story in the following respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-8\">Natalie testified that she had seen the defendant in the complainant\u2019s apartment at least once since the complainant\u2019s sister had moved out. She also testified that on the afternoon in question she went to the complainant\u2019s apartment to tell her she had a telephone call in the Avingers\u2019 apartment. When the complainant opened the door, Natalie saw the defendant sitting on the couch. After receiving the message, the complainant sat back down with him briefly before coming downstairs.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-9\">Natalie and her mother both testified that later that afternoon the complainant had come to their apartment a second time saying that she had been raped, and that at that time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>she was wearing a \u201cblack nightgown\u201d under a raincoat. This testimony regarding the complainant\u2019s attire was consistent with that given by a nurse who interviewed the complainant at the hospital following the incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-5\">Boyd testified that he knew both the complainant and the defendant, and that sometime that afternoon (it is unclear when) he went to the complainant\u2019s apartment. He testified that the defendant answered the door for him and that they had a brief conversation. He did not see the complainant there at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-6\">In addition, defense counsel made a number of attempts during the examination of several witnesses to bring out further facts regarding the relationships between the complainant and the defendant and between the complainant and Boyd. t These examinations, and other facts, are discussed as relevant, <em>infra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b29-7\">1. <em>Prosecutor\u2019s comment on the defendant\u2019s \u201csilence.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b29-8\">At trial, the two arresting officers testified that when they found the defendant, they brought him before the complainant, who identified him, saying \u201cThat\u2019s him. That\u2019s the man who raped me.\u201d On cross-examination, the defendant brought out the fact that after the officers \u201ctook Mr. Mosby into custody,\u201d he made certain statements. One was something to the effect of, \u201cYou\u2019ve got the wrong guy.\u201d Another was, \u201cShe\u2019s full of shit. I have known her for eighteen months.\u201d On redirect, however, one of the officers testified that the defendant did not make these statements at the time when the complainant identified him, but only after he had been placed in the cruiser, which was ten or fifteen minutes after the time he was first apprehended.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-9\">Thereafter, the defendant attempted to establish that he had not been silent at the time of the confrontation but rather had made some response in the face of the complainant\u2019s accusations. Defense counsel asked Avinger, \u201cDid you hear [defendant] say anything when he was arrested?\u201d The prosecutor immediately objected and the question was excluded. The defendant later asked Boyd the same question. Boyd replied in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>the affirmative, but the follow up question (\u201cAnd what did he say?\u201d) was excluded on objection by the prosecutor.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-5\">In closing argument, the prosecutor drew the jury\u2019s attention to the officer\u2019s testimony regarding the defendant\u2019s statements, and reminded the jury of the testimony as to the time they were made.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b30-6\">The defendant urges that the prosecutor\u2019s argument was grossly improper. We agree. It is quite clear from the transcript that the prosecutor, in this portion of his argument, was inviting the jury to draw the inferences (1) that the defendant was, in fact, silent in the face of the complainant\u2019s accusations, and (2) that such silence was evidence of his guilt and his consciousness thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-7\">a. The argument made here by the Commonwealth assumes, as its premise, the fact that the defendant stood mute when confronted with the accusations of the complainant. In fact, the only testimony on this point is to the contrary. As set out above, Boyd testified that he heard the defendant say something at the time of the confrontation, although he was not allowed to go on to testify as to what the defendant actually said.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-8\">\u201cIt is, of course, beyond dispute that a prosecutor commits error when he uses closing argument to argue or suggest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>facts not previously introduced in evidence.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Storey, </em>378 Mass. 312, 324 (1979). See also S.J.C. Rule 3:22A, PF 13(a), 14, 377 Mass. 927 (1979) (effective March 1, 1979). Given Boyd\u2019s testimony that the defendant did say something at the time of the confrontation, the prosecutor\u2019s argument that the defendant was silent is unsupported by the record and amounts to a clear misstatement of the evidence. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nordstrom, </em>364 Mass. 310, 315-316 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b31-5\">b. Even if the testimony fully supported the prosecutor\u2019s assertion that the defendant was indeed silent in the face of the complainant\u2019s accusations, the prosecutor could not properly have argued to the jury that such silence constituted evidence of the defendant\u2019s guilt. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>369 Mass. 715, 733 (1976), and cases cited; Fed.R. Evidence 512(a). We pass, as inapposite to our analysis, the question whether this was an adoptive admission, compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Morrison, </em>1 Mass. App. Ct. 632, 634 (1973), and cases cited, because the record clearly shows that, at the time of the confrontation, the defendant was \u201cin custody\u201d within the meaning of <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 467 (1966), and thus had an absolute right to remain silent.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>467-468. It is elementary that if the right to remain silent is to have real practical force, it cannot be burdened by prosecution comments which cast aspersions upon its exercise. It is for this reason that a prosecutor may not draw adverse inferences from a defendant\u2019s failure, at trial, to testify or present evidence in his own behalf. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gouveia, </em>371 Mass. 566, 570-571 (1976); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Smallwood, </em>379 Mass. 878, 891 (1980). And it is for the same reason that a prosecutor may not argue to the jury that a defendant\u2019s silence, at the time of his arrest, constitutes evidence of his guilt. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cobb, </em>374 Mass. 514, 520-521 (1978). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brant, </em>380 Mass. 876, 886-887 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b32-5\">In the present case, the prosecutor referred the jury to the complainant\u2019s face-to-face accusations of the defendant and asked the jury, \u201cDid he say anything then, ladies and gentlemen?\u201d This argument is virtually indistinguishable from the one made by the prosecutor in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Haas, </em>373 Mass. 545, 559 (1977), and the court\u2019s discussion of the argument there is fully applicable here. Therefore, even if the record supported the premise that the defendant was silent at the time of the confrontation, the inference of guilt which the prosecutor sought to build on that premise would still constitute improper argument as a violation of the defendant\u2019s right to remain silent under <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, supra. </em>See <em>Doyle </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>426 U.S. 610, 633-635 (1976) (Stevens, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b32-6\">c. The third and perhaps strongest factor which contributes to the impropriety of the prosecutor\u2019s argument in this case involves a matter of simple fairness in the conduct of the defendant\u2019s trial. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nordstrom, </em>364 Mass. at 316.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-7\">When the defendant sought to elicit testimony from Milton Boyd and Ruby Avinger regarding the content of the defendant\u2019s statements at the time of the confrontation, the prosecutor objected and successfully had the questions excluded. Having initiated the exclusion of the defendant\u2019s statements, the prosecutor acted improperly in arguing that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>the defendant stood silent in the face of the complainant\u2019s accusations. See S.J.C. Rule 3:22A, PF 13(a), 14, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b33-5\">If it is improper for a prosecutor to comment on evidence excluded at the defendant\u2019s request, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Burke, </em>373 Mass. 569, 575 (1977); see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fitzgerald, </em>376 Mass. 402, 418-419 (1978), it is particularly improper for a prosecutor to call the jury\u2019s attention to an absence of evidence when the absence is a result of the prosecutor\u2019s objection to the introduction of that evidence. On this point, we think it is sufficient to point out that a party\u2019s success in excluding evidence from the consideration of the jury does not later give that party license to invite inferences (whether true or, as in this case, false) regarding the excluded evidence. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Burke, supra. </em>See also <em>Harris </em>v. <em>New York, </em>401 U.S. 222, 225-226 (1971); <em>Oregon </em>v. <em>Hass, </em>420 U.S. 714, 723 (1975); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mahnke, </em>368 Mass. 662, 691-697 (1975), cert. denied, 425 U.S. 959 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b33-6\">In sum, we think it is clear that the prosecutor\u2019s argument regarding the defendant\u2019s \u201csilence\u201d at the time of the confrontation was error, and in the circumstances of this case it was highly prejudicial error. We are mindful of the \u201cjurors\u2019 natural tendency to infer guilt from a failure to deny guilt.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cobb, </em>374 Mass. at 520. Moreover, this is hardly a case in which the subject of the improper argument was only remotely or collaterally related to the ultimate issue of guilt. Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hawley, </em>380 Mass. 70, 84 (1980), with <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Donahue, </em>369 Mass. 943, 952, cert. denied, 429 U.S. 833 (1976). Therefore, \u201c[w]e cannot overestimate the effect on the jury of . . . [the] argument tending to show consciousness of guilt on the part of the defendant.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cobb, supra </em>at 521.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-7\">d. Having decided that the prosecutor\u2019s argument on this topic was improper (contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fitzgerald, </em>376 Mass. at 419, and cases cited), and that its effect on the jury was likely to be unduly prejudicial, we turn to the question whether the judge\u2019s instructions were effective to cure the prosecutor\u2019s error.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>Following the prosecutor\u2019s closing, the defendant submitted a request for a \u201ccautionary instruction\u201d which specifically dealt with the prosecutor\u2019s comments on the defendant\u2019s \u201csilence.\u201d The judge then charged the jury, cautioning generally that the arguments of counsel are not evidence. However, the judge made no specific reference to the prosecutor\u2019s improper comments and did not give the cautionary instruction requested by the defendant. Following the charge, counsel for the defendant approached the bench and asked the judge to \u201cnote my objection to not giving that cautionary instruction.\u201d After some discussion, the judge then agreed to give the instruction requested by the defendant \u201cas given.\u201d Instead, however, the judge gave an extemporaneous instruction which mainly repeated that the case was to be decided \u201con the evidence, not on anything said in the arguments.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b34-5\">The defendant argues that the judge\u2019s supplementary instruction on this point was insufficient to cure the prejudice created by the prosecutor\u2019s comments. Viewing the supplementary instruction in light of the entire charge, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sellon, </em>380 Mass. 220, 234 (1980), we are constrained to agree, for several reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-6\">We pass over the fact that the judge did not instruct the jury to disregard the prosecutor\u2019s improper comments at the time they were made. But see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hawley, </em>380 Mass. at 85 (\u201cThe preferred action . . . would have been to charge the jury then and there\u201d). When given, the supplementary instruction consisted mainly of several repetitions of the judge\u2019s earlier instructions that the case should be decided on the evidence rather than on the arguments. In the circumstances of the present case, where the prosecutor\u2019s comments asserted against the defendant such highly prejudicial evidence as an admission, we do not think that such general warnings \u201cwent far enough in emphasizing the particulars in which the prosecutor\u2019s argument was grossly improper.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Killelea, </em>370 Mass. 638, 648 (1976). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hawley, supra </em>at 85.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-7\">Here, the instruction given did not point out the particulars which were the basis and purpose for the defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>request for an additional instruction. The judge told the jury that the defendant had objected to the prosecutor\u2019s argument on this topic and that he had excluded the argument at that time (which, in fact, he did not do). But the judge did not inform the jury, as the defendant had requested, that the prosecutor had objected to all of the defendant\u2019s evidence regarding his statements at the time of his arrest, that the court had excluded that evidence, and that it was for this reason that the jury must disregard the prosecutor\u2019s argument regarding the absence of that evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-5\">A trial judge has broad discretion in the giving of instructions, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>MacDonald, </em>371 Mass. 600, 603 (1976); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Shagoury, </em>6 Mass. App. Ct. 584, 599 (1978), cert. denied, 440 U.S. 962 (1979), and we do not mean to imply that curative instructions must include a detailed explanation of the reasons for disregarding the matter at issue. Here, however, the prosecutor had argued to the jury, in essence, that the defendant\u2019s \u201csilence\u201d in the face of the complainant\u2019s accusations was to be considered evidence of his guilt. In these circumstances, we do not think that a supplementary instruction could have been effective to cure the highly prejudicial effect of this argument unless the jurors were informed that the judge had ruled out the evidence on which it was based, or at least, that there was no evidence before them to support it.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-6\">We need not decide whether any of the factors discussed above is dispositive as to the insufficiency of the curative instruction here. Considering them together, we think that the instruction failed to cure the prejudice created by the prosecutor\u2019s argument. Therefore, in light of the prosecutor\u2019s improper argument regarding the defendant\u2019s silence, and of the inadequacy of the supplementary instruction in the circumstances, we reverse the judgment and remand the case for a new trial.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b36-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>2. <em>Prosecutor\u2019s comment on \u201cdropping the complaint.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b36-5\">As we have already concluded that retrial is necessary, we do not consider whether this comment, standing alone, was a serious misstep requiring reversal. We repeat once more, however, that \u201c[i]t is long past time for prosecutors to prepare their closing arguments carefully in order to avoid the possibility of reversals of convictions because of prosecutorial error.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>O\u2019Brien, </em>377 Mass. 772, 778 (1979). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Haas, </em>373 Mass. at 557 &amp;. n. 11; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Earltop, </em>372 Mass. 199, 204-206 (1977) (Hennessey, C. J., concurring); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ryan, </em>8 Mass. App. Ct. 941, 941-942 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b36-7\">3. <em>Exclusion of questions under rape shield law.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b36-8\">Prior to trial, the defendant brought motions to allow evidence of the complainant\u2019s reputation for unchastity and of the complainant\u2019s alleged sexual conduct with a third party shortly before the alleged rape. At a lobby conference on the morning of trial, the judge denied both motions under the \u201crape shield law,\u201d G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 21B (inserted by St. 1977, c. 110), subject to voir dire at a later time. However, because the defendant apparently never requested voir dire thereafter, and because the defendant makes no argument here that the denial of his motions was error, we do not consider the propriety of the judge\u2019s rulings on them.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>The defendant does argue, however, that the judge erred in sustaining objections to seven questions asked by defense counsel at various points in the trial. The excluded questions fall into two separate categories. Questions in one category dealt with the prior relationship between the complainant and the defendant, and questions in the other dealt with the relationship between the complainant and Boyd.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-5\">The defendant assumes that the judge excluded these questions on the ground that they violated the rape shield law<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and argues that the statute does not require that they be excluded. The Commonwealth\u2019s brief does not directly address the propriety of these questions under the statute. It argues instead that they are objectionable as to form, as being vague and overbroad, and that for that reason there was a likelihood that they would elicit answers which would have been improper under the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-6\">Analytically, a determination whether these questions were properly excluded would involve examination of three distinct issues: (1) Were the areas of inquiry permissible under the rape shield law? (2) Were the questions proper as to form? and (3) Was the testimony which they sought to elicit material? We address this assignment of error only for guidance on retrial. In that context, we direct our attention mainly to the question whether the areas which the defendant seeks to explore are permissible under the statute, assuming proper form on retrial, and leave the question of materiality to the sound discretion of the trial judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-7\">In a prosecution for rape under G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 22, the rape shield law, G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 21B, prohibits the introduction of evidence dealing with \u201cthe reputation of a victim\u2019s sexual conduct.\u201d It also prohibits evidence of \u201cspecific instances of a victim\u2019s sexual conduct,\u201d with exceptions available in two specified areas when the defendant follows a specified procedure.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b38-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>No previous case has squarely presented the need to construe this new statute, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bohannon, </em>376 Mass. 90, 95 (1978),<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and given our holding in part one, <em>supra, </em>the present case is not the proper occasion for undertaking an extensive interpretation. As an initial matter, however, we note that the statute requires counsel (and the judge) to walk a fine line in dealing with the testimony regarding the complainant in a rape case. On one hand, counsel must have a demonstrable good faith basis for asking any question \u201ceven remotely connected with the [the complainant\u2019s] sexual conduct,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bohannon, supra </em>at 95, and must seek an advance determination of the propriety of such a question if its propriety is unclear. <em>Id. </em>at 92 n.2. On the other hand, <em>Bohannon </em>itself demonstrates that there are circumstances in which the defendant\u2019s questioning concerns \u201ca critical issue\u201d in the trial and excessive limitation of such questioning can have such a \u201csignificant impact on the result of the trial\u201d as to deny the defendant his \u201cright to present a full defense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 94, citing <em>Chambers </em>v. <em>Mississippi, </em>410 U.S. 284 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b38-5\">As to the areas of permissible examination, <em>Bohannon </em>emphatically requires caution regarding questions \u201cin any way connected with the [complainant\u2019s] past sexual conduct.\u201d 376 Mass. at 92 n.2. We note that the area forbidden without an in camera hearing, however, is <em>sexual </em>conduct, and we therefore think the language cited above was not intended to bar a defendant from bringing out the threshold facts regarding the mere existence of a relationship between the defendant and the complainant. We agree with the de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>fendant that it was critical to his theory of the case \u201cto be able to show that the defendant, as a person on friendly terms with the complainant, had most likely been admitted to her apartment as a welcome guest, rather than gaining access by forcible entry.\u201d Therefore, insofar as the defendant\u2019s questions sought to establish that a relationship did, in fact, exist between the complainant and the defendant, i.e., that they knew each other, it is elementary that this area of examination would be permissible on retrial, assuming the questions are in proper form.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Likewise, and on the additional assumption that the inquiry is material, we see no reason why the defendant should not be allowed to make the same showing regarding any relationship which existed between the complainant and Milton Boyd.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b39-5\">However, the issue of admissibility under the statute becomes more difficult where the defendant\u2019s questioning turns to the character and extent of such relationships. On this issue, we think that the defendant may also show how well the parties knew each other; however, such questions must be framed specifically enough to avoid the likelihood of eliciting testimony bearing on the complainant\u2019s past sexual conduct or reputation, and, if counsel has knowledge which gives him reason to believe that even carefully framed questions will elicit answers \u201cin any way connected with the [complainant\u2019s] . . . sexual conduct\u201d with the defendant or Boyd, he should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>seek an advance determination of the propriety of such questions, as suggested in note <em>2 </em>of <em>Bohannon, supra.</em><footnotemark><em>10</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b40-5\">It is not feasible for us to frame a rule which would guide counsel in determining how far he or she may go in bringing out the character of the parties\u2019 prior relationships not covered by the specific provisions of the statute. Obviously, this will depend on the extent to which the content of the questions bears on sexual conduct or reputation, the care with which the questions are framed, and the particular facts of the case. For this reason, the decision as to the propriety of particular questions must be left to the discretion of the judge on retrial.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> We only add parenthetically that just as a prosecutor must carefully prepare closing argument to avoid prejudice to the rights of the defendant, counsel for the defendant in a rape case must carefully prepare examinations to avoid prejudice to the rights of the complainant under the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-6\">4. <em>Trial judge\u2019s criticism of defense counsel.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b40-7\">The defendant claims that the trial judge repeatedly criticized and belittled defense counsel in front of the jury, and that this conduct denied the defendant due process by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>depriving him of a fair trial before an impartial jury. He argues that the judge prejudiced his position in the eyes of the jury, and cites fourteen remarks made by the trial judge in support of that argument.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b41-5\">We recognize that \u201cany judicial comment is likely to be accorded substantial weight by the jury.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sneed, </em>376 Mass. 867, 870 (1978), citing <em>Quercia </em>v. <em>United States, </em>289 U.S. 466, 470 (1933). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hanscomb, </em>367 Mass. 726, 732 (1975) (Hennessey, J., concurring) . We recognize further that the particular danger created by such criticism in open court is the likelihood that it will \u201cimpress the jury with the idea that [the judge] disfavors the attorney and, inferentially, the position the attorney represents.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Pokini, </em>55 Haw. 640, 645 (1974) (plurality opinion). Suffice it to say here that we hope that at retrial the judge will adhere to his duty to \u201ckeep the trial on an orderly course and to avoid prejudicial occurrences.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>French, </em>357 Mass. 356, 395 (1970), judgments vacated as to death penalty sub nom. <em>Limone </em>v. <em>Massachusetts, </em>408 U.S. 936 (1972). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Haley, </em>363 Mass. 513, 521 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">5. <em>Sufficiency of the evidence.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b41-7\">One of the counts of the rape indictment charges that the defendant committed the offense of \u201cunnatural sexual intercourse\u201d \u2014 here it was an act of cunnilingus. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>6 Mass. App. Ct. 854 (1978). The most relevant testimony on this charge was given by the victim, who testified on direct examination that the defendant \u201cput his mouth to \u2014 to my vagina,\u201d and on cross-examination that he \u201cput his mouth down below.\u201d The defendant argues that this evidence is insufficient to support a conviction of rape, and that the judge therefore erred in denying the defendant\u2019s motion for a required finding of not guilty under Mass.R.Crim.P. 25, 378 Mass. 896 (1979). We do not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>agree. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rogers, </em>9 Mass. App. Ct. 812 (1980); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>9 Mass. App. Ct. 609, 622-623 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b42-5\">In 1974, the Legislature enacted a comprehensive revision of the crimes involving violent sexual assault, which amended the rape statute to include the crime of forcible \u201cunnatural sexual intercourse.\u201d St. 1974, c. 474, \u00a7\u00a7 1-3. By this amendment, an act of forced cunnilingus became punishable as a rape. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gallant, </em>373 Mass. 577, 584 (1977); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mamay, </em>5 Mass. App. Ct. 708, 710 (1977).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gallant, supra, </em>the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b42-6\">\u201c[T]he definition of \u2018unnatural sexual intercourse\u2019 must be taken to include <em>oral </em>and anal <em>intercourse, </em>including fellatio, <em>cunnilingus, </em>and other intrusions of a part of a person\u2019s body or other object into the genital or anal opening of another person\u2019s body\u201d (emphasis supplied). 373 Mass. at 584.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b42-7\">Given this definition, we think that the evidence here provides a sufficient basis for a reasonable jury to infer that there was an act of unnatural sexual intercourse within the meaning of G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 22. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Whitehead, </em>379 Mass. 640, 653 (1980) (cunnilingus); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Manning, </em>6 Mass. App. Ct. 430, 434-435 (1978) (oral sex). See also State v. <em>Murry, 136 </em>La. 253, 260 (1914) (cunnilingus is \u201ccommitted with the mouth and the female sexual organ\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b42-8\">We turn now to the defendant\u2019s argument on the sufficiency of the evidence with respect to all the charges. The defendant argues that the jury could not reasonably have rejected the testimony of three witnesses (Ruby and Natalie <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>Avinger and the nurse) to the effect that the complainant was wearing a black \u201cnightgown\u201d or \u201ccamisole\u201d following the incident, in favor of the testimony of the complainant and one of the police officers to the effect that she was wearing pants, a top, and a coat. The argument continues that, if the jury must believe that the complainant was so dressed, they could not reasonably have believed that the acts allegedly committed by the defendant were accomplished by force or against her will, because \u201cthe inference is overwhelming that she donned [the nightgown] in preparation for consensual boudoir dalliance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">This argument lacks substantial merit. We do not comment on the logic of the inference which the defendant seeks to draw. We merely repeat that on a motion for directed verdict, the evidence is to be considered in the light most favorable to the prosecution, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Walter, </em>10 Mass. App. Ct. 255, 257 (1980), and once a conflict in the evidence is raised, it is \u201cfor the jury to sort out and is not material to the directed verdict issue.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 261. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dabrieo, </em>370 Mass. 728, 734 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b43-6\">\n<em>Judgments reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b43-7\">\n<em>Verdicts set aside.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b26-11\"> As to the defendant\u2019s other claims of error, it appears that the defendant failed to preserve the issues by objection. See Mass. R. Crim. P. Rule 22, 378 Mass. 892 (1979). For guidance, however, we briefly address the issues raised in these arguments insofar as they may have relevance on retrial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b30-9\">The transcript of this part of the argument reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b30-10\">\u201cI suggest to you that it\u2019s important to remember that. . . they were driving back in the cruiser, I believe the officer\u2019s testimony was, it was at that time when the defendant made the statement relative to knowing her for two years, or whatever .... Certainly a statement saying he didn\u2019t do it. When did he make that statement? I believe the officer testified fifteen or twenty minutes after he had him up against the wall, in the hallway .... He makes that statement fifteen or twenty minutes later. He\u2019s had time to think.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b30-11\">Defense Counsel: \u201cObjection, Your Honor.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b30-12\">Prosecutor: \u201cAnd before that time, ladies and gentlemen, police officer\u2019s testimony that he was face to face with the victim,. . . , and she said \u2018That\u2019s the man who raped me, broke into my apartment.\u2019 Did he say anything then, ladies and gentlemen?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b30-13\">Defense Counsel: \u201cObjection, Your Honor. . . . That question was objected to and excluded.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b30-14\">The Court: \u201cStay away from it. I will cover that subject in the charge.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b31-6\"> The transcript does not reveal when the police formally placed the defendant under arrest. However, a suspect is considered to be \u201cin custody\u201d when he has been \u201cdeprived of his freedom of action in any significant way.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Haas, </em>373 Mass. 545, 551 (1977), citing <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>384 U.S. at 444. Here, the officers testified that when they found the defendant in the apartment, they drew their guns, put him \u201cup against the wall,\u201d and patted him down for weapons. One of the officers also testified that he may have put the handcuffs on the defendant at that time, although he was not sure. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cobb, </em>374 Mass. 514, 518 (1978). From that point forward, the defendant was no longer free to leave voluntarily. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cruz, </em>373 Mass. 676, 683-684 (1977). Given all this, and the fact that the police efforts were already tightly focused on the defendant, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Haas, </em>373 Mass. at 553, it is evident that the defendant was \u201cin custody\" from the time the police apprehended him in the apartment. The defendant therefore had a right to remain silent at the time of the confrontation, whether or not the police actually informed him of that right, and there is nothing in the transcript to indicate that this right was waived in any way. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cobb, supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b35-7\"> The Commonwealth argues that the propriety of the prosecutor\u2019s argument is not presented for review at all because the defendant failed to take yet a further objection after the supplementary instruction was given. However, the purpose of the objection requirement embodied in Rules 22 and 24(b) of the new Massachusetts Rules of Criminal Procedure, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>378 Mass. 842 (1979), is to ensure that an alleged error is brought clearly to the judge\u2019s attention so that he may squarely consider and decide the question. See 3 Wright &amp; Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 842 (1969) (discussing analogous Fed.R.Grim.P. <em>51). </em>See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McDuffee, </em>379 Mass. 353, 357-360 (1979) (the only case to date discussing new Mass.R.Crim.P. 24 [b]). We think that the defendant\u2019s efforts here were sufficient to accomplish that purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-10\">\u201cWe have insisted on counsel\u2019s duty to alert the judge to prosecutorial abuse, but we have not made a fetish of the form or persistence of the objections, lest the accused suffer unduly from the inadvertence of his advocate.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hawley, </em>380 Mass. at 86. Moreover, even if we reviewed the prosecutor\u2019s argument and the supplementary instruction only under the higher standard requiring a \u201csubstantial risk of a miscarriage of justice,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Freeman, </em>352 Mass. 556, 564 (1967), we think that such a risk would be present in light of the constitutional dimensions of the error here. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wood, </em>7 Mass. App. Ct. 455, 458 (1979), <em>S.C. </em>380 Mass. 545 (1980).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b37-8\"> The transcript does not reveal the specific reason for the exclusion of each question. However, it is clear that at least three of these questions were disallowed under that statute.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b37-9\"> The relevant portion of the statute reads as follows: \u201cEvidence of specific instances of a victim\u2019s sexual conduct . . . shall not be admissible except <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>evidence of the victim\u2019s sexual conduct with the defendant or evidence of recent conduct of the victim alleged to be the cause of any physical feature, characteristic, or condition of the victim; provided, however, that such evidence shall be admissible only after an in camera hearing on a written motion for admission of same and an offer of proof.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b38-11\"> <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bohannon, supra, </em>was decided as a matter of common law and expressly did not \u201creach any issues related to the recently enacted \u2018rape-shield\u2019 statute.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>However, parts of the opinion are clearly applicable to our discussion of the statute, and we treat them as such here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b39-6\"> In fact, as the Commonwealth points out, the background facts regarding the complainant\u2019s relationship with the defendant did come out at other points in the trial, including such facts as how long they had known each other, how they had met, and how often they saw each other. Such examination was clearly proper, if not necessary, to set the relationship in time and space for the jury.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b39-7\"> As to the materiality of this testimony, the defendant argues that it was important for the jury to understand that Boyd and the complainant were friendly enough, as neighbors, for Boyd to drop by the complainant\u2019s apartment without invitation. Otherwise, the defendant argues, the jury would be \u201ccompletely mystified\u201d as to how Boyd happened to knock at her door sometime on the day of the incident and see the defendant alone in her apartment, as Boyd testified. We note, however, that some of the defendant\u2019s questions regarding the relationship between Boyd and the complainant were not framed specifically enough to elicit the fact that he was an occasional visitor.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b40-8\"> A fortiori, if counsel plans to examine specifically on the subject of one of the exceptions set out in the statute, he should follow the voir dire procedure set out therein. We note that the defendant here did properly observe the statutory requirement in bringing a pretrial motion for a ruling under the second exception. Because the report of the hospital\u2019s examination of the complainant indicated the presence of sperm, the defendant sought to introduce evidence that this was the result of intercourse with a person other than the defendant, and offered testimony by an (unnamed) witness who would say that he \u201cleft [complainant\u2019s] apartment early that morning.\u201d The judge excluded this evidence because defense counsel did not know whether the witness would testify that he had actually had sexual intercourse with the complainant. As noted <em>supra, </em>we need not decide whether this ruling was correct. Rather, we note the defendant\u2019s motion here is a good illustration of the kind of situation in which the statutory screening procedure must be observed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b40-9\"> We note, however, that several of the defendant\u2019s questions are the kind of open-ended questions which should <em>not </em>be allowed under the statute. As to these' questions, we agree with the Commonwealth that they are \u201cvirtually unlimited in scope\u201d and \u201c[pjrovide neither a time frame nor a focus to the general terms of . . . relationship.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b41-8\"> In fairness to the judge, we note that the defendant\u2019s appellate counsel concedes that \u201c[djefense counsel\u2019s performance at trial was no model. The trial was pervaded by an aura of bumble.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b42-9\">The defendant in the present case is charged under G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 22. While the two cited cases deal with prosecutions under \u00a7\u00a723 and 22A, respectively, there is \u201cnothing to suggest that the words \u2018unnatural sexual intercourse\u2019 were intended to vary in meaning from section to section.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gonzales, </em>5 Mass.
