The plaintiffs claim that the transportation plan violates G. L. c. 71, \u00a7\u00a7 7A and 7C. We hold that the plan conforms to statutory requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-10\">The plaintiffs brought this action in 1977 to challenge a decision by the Greater New Bedford Regional Vocational Technical High School Committee<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (committee) to use public rather than private bus services to transport approximately 1,000 New Bedford students to the regional district\u2019s new high school. The public bus service was supplied by the Southeastern Regional Transit Authority (SERTA) \u2014 a regional transportation authority operating pursuant to G. L. c. 161B<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> \u2014 through its agent, the Union Street Railway Company (Union Street). The plaintiffs sought a declaration that the transportation plan violated G. L. c. 71, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>\u00a7\u00a7 7A<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and 7C.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> They also sought injunctions to stop the plan from taking effect and to prevent the various State de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>fendants from approving it or assisting SERTA financially. After a seventeen-day trial, a judge sitting in the Superior Court entered a memorandum of decision which held substantially in the defendants\u2019 favor. A judgment was subsequently entered which denied the requested injunctive relief and which declared, in essence, that the committee\u2019s actions complied in all respects with the requirements of the pertinent statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-4\">The facts, taken principally from the judge\u2019s findings, may be summarized as follows. Some time prior to the fall of 1977, the committee began to discuss the transportation needs of the students who would attend the new regional high school opening that September. These discussions included the merits of using public as opposed to privately-contracted transportation for the students. In July, 1977, the committee solicited bids from private carriers for the transportation contract. In the bid invitation and the accompanying specifications, the committee reserved the right \u201cto reject any or all bids or any part thereof.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">Before the bid deadline, the committee received sealed bids from four private contractors and a proposal from Union Street on behalf of SERTA. Union Street\u2019s letter indicated that over ninety-five per cent of the New Bedford students lived within 1,500 feet of the existing SERTA bus route which directly or indirectly serviced the school. By adding buses on some routes and making minor modifications on others, SERTA buses could carry almost all of the students who needed transportation. It was proposed that the committee make bulk purchases of books containing \u201c10-ride school tickets\u201d which would be distributed to the students. Each ticket would be good for one zone of travel at the usual one-half student fare. A student would board a regular SERTA bus at the stop nearest his home and would use one or two tickets, depending on the distance (zones) from the bus stop to the school, in the same manner as regular passengers who were taking the bus. The proposal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>did not comply with at least five of the committee\u2019s published specifications.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b579-4\">After hearing representatives of the private carriers and Union Street, the committee voted on August 7, 1977, four to two, to award the transportation contract to one of the private bidders. Because of a rule that a majority of five votes was necessary to pass any matter before the committee, the motion was declared defeated. On August 9, 1977, the committee voted, five to three, to accept Union Street\u2019s proposal, to reject all the private bids, and to readvertise for new bids for the transportation of those students living in Fairhaven and Dartmouth as well as certain outlying sections of New Bedford who could not be accommodated on SERTA\u2019s routes. Transportation for these students was eventually arranged with one of the private companies. At the time of its votes, the committee had information from which it could find that the district would save money by using public transportation.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">In September, 1977, the plan went into effect. Union Street added eleven buses from its existing stock to service certain routes. All the carriers traveled along regular public bus routes to the high school. In order to meet demand at peak times, the interval between buses on some of the routes was reduced from fifteen to ten minutes. In the afternoon, eleven buses were released from SERTA\u2019s garage and traveled directly to the high school with \u201cout of service\u201d signs on their rollers. These buses picked up the students at 2:30 p.m. and then proceeded to pick up and dispatch passengers along established routes within the city. There was evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>that nonstudent passengers were not denied access to the buses (although at peak times the majority of the passengers were students), that the buses were not modified in any respect to carry the students,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and that the arrangements made were consistent with measures usually taken by SERTA to meet community needs.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b580-4\">1. We first address the plaintiffs\u2019 contention that the transportation plan is illegal because it violates that portion of G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 7C (see note 6, <em>supra) </em>which denies financial assistance to public carriers who violate or breach a prescribed agreement by engaging in school bus operations, exclusively for the transportation of students. The plaintiffs argue that this statute was designed to promote free enterprise by keeping public transportation systems completely out of this market. These arguments overlook the existence of G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 7B, as amended through St. 1978, c. 514, \u00a7 188,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> the interrelation between \u00a7\u00a7 7A, 7B, and 7C, and the judge\u2019s findings on the crucial issue whether this plan <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>amounts to \u201cschool bus operations, exclusively for the transportation of students.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b581-4\">Since 1947, G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 7A, has set forth the conditions and mechanisms for reimbursement of the costs spent by municipalities on contracts for the mandatory transportation of students to schools. See Rep. A.G. , Pub. Doc. No. 12, at 120 (1965); 1965 Ann. Survey Mass. Law \u00a7 20.24, at 318. Beginning in 1961, unsuccessful legislative efforts were made to obtain additional reimbursement to municipalities for a greater portion of pupil transportation costs. See, e.g., 1962 Senate Doc. No. 899; 1964 Senate Doc. No. 806. In April, 1964, the Governor filed a special message with the Legislature with respect to the Commonwealth\u2019s transportation problems. Out of this message came 1964 Senate Doc. No. 925, which was engrossed and enacted on June 17,1964, as St. 1964, c. 563.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Section 8 of this chapter created \u00a7 7B of c. 71, to reimburse municipalities for direct<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> or indirect<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> costs, not otherwise reimbursable under \u00a7 7A, incurred in connection with pupil transportation by bus companies (licensed under G. L. c. 159A, \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 7) or by the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (under G. L. c. 161A). In 1973, \u00a7 7B was amended (St. 1973, c. 1141, \u00a7 5) to authorize reimbursement for transportation costs arising out of the use of regional transportation authorities established under G. L. c. 161B. Sections <em>7A </em>and 7B provide special subsidies within the framework of the education law (see Rep. A.G., <em>supra </em>at 121) to assist municipalities <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>in achieving the goal (stated in \u00a7 7A) of \u201c transporting] . . . pupils at the lowest cost commensurate with their safety.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b582-4\">Section 7C \u2014 taken from a section of the 1973 Federal-Aid Highway Act<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> \u2014 was added to the statutory scheme in 1976. This statute is intended to protect the legitimate economic expectations of private school bus operators. It seeks as well to insure that public transportation companies will not forsake their basic priority of providing economical transportation for people living in urban areas for potentially more lucrative school bus contracts.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">These three statutes must be construed in light of the foregoing legislative history and their respective objectives <em>(Board of Educ. </em>v. <em>Assessor of Worcester, </em>368 Mass. 511, 513 [1975], and cases cited) under the settled principle that \u201c[s]ections of the same chapter are to be interpreted, if reasonably practicable, so as to constitute an harmonious and consistent body of laws.\u201d <em>Gosselin </em>v. <em>Gosselin, </em>1 Mass. App. Ct. 146, 148 (1973), citing <em>Kelley </em>v. <em>Jordan Marsh Co., </em>278 Mass. 101, 111 (1932). See <em>Morse </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>253 Mass. 247, 252 (1925); <em>McCue </em>v. <em>Director of Civil Serv., </em>325 Mass. 605, 611 (1950). We do not view \u00a7 7C as an attempt to nullify the ability of a municipality to obtain maximum reimbursement by making the most efficient use of available private and public facilities to transport its students. Rather, \u00a7 7C bars public carriers (under threat of loss of certain financial assistance) from \u201cengaging] in school bus operations, exclusively for the transportation of students. ...\u201d This restriction on public carriers indirectly limits a municipality in its choice of resources for pupil transportation.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>In this statutory context, the trial judge ruled that he was \u201cunable to find that SERTA engaged in the transportation of students on routes especially established for the purpose of carrying students to the exclusion of others.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> He apparently accepted the evidence that, within the transportation industry, \u201cschool bus operations\u201d involve \u201ctransportation by bus exclusively for school students . . . using [certain specific types of] school vehicles as defined in the Highway Safety Program . . .\u201d (49 C.F.R. \u00a7 605.3 [1976]), and he apparently construed the critical word \u201cexclusively\u201d in accordance with its approved usage (G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 6, Third; <em>Moy </em>v. <em>Jack Madden Ford Sales, Inc., 4 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 102, 105 [1976]) to mean \u201cin an exclusive manner,\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New Inti. Dictionary 793 (1976) ;<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 506, 507 (5th ed. 1979). See <em>Chatham Corp. </em>v. <em>State Tax Commn., </em>362 Mass. 216, 219 (1972). We believe, with respect to school bus operations, that the word \u201cexclusively,\u201d as used in \u00a7 7G, denotes service which limits ridership only to student passengers on special routes under a closed door policy. The question whether the plan in this case amounted to exclusive school bus operations thus became one of fact for the judge to resolve under the relevant legal principles just discussed. The plaintiffs have not shown that the judge misconceived or misapplied these prin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>ciples or that his findings on the determinative issue of exclusivity were clearly erroneous.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Mass.R.Civ.P. 52(a), 365 Mass. 816 (1974). <em>United States </em>v. <em>United States Gypsum Co., </em>333 U.S. 364, 395 (1948). <em>Building Inspector of Lancaster </em>v. <em>Sanderson, </em>372 Mass. 157, 160-161 (1977), Smith &amp; Zobel, Rules Practice \u00a7 52.7 (1977).<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The conclusion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>that this aspect of the plan did not violate the transportation statutes was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">2. The plaintiffs next argue that the \u201caward of a public school transportation contract in the absence of a sealed bid and in disrespect of specifications promulgated by the awarding authority violates ... \u00a7 7A.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">Section 7A is in essence a reimbursement statute which permits a municipality to recoup some or all of its pupil transportation expenses for a contract awarded to a private company \u201cupon the basis of prevailing wage rates . . . and of sealed bids.\u201d The statute specifically provides that any expenses submitted for reimbursement are to be rejected if the Commissioner of Education determines that the expenses have been incurred for transportation which \u201cis not authorized <em>hereunder </em>or has been incurred pursuant to any contract awarded in violation of any provision <em>of this section </em>...\u201d (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b585-7\">Section 7B, on the other hand, authorizes reimbursement of \u201cpart of the cost not reimburseable under section seven A.\u201d This statute makes no provision for sealed bids or minimum wage rates, as required for reimbursement in \u00a7 7A. The language in the two statutes is relatively straightforward \u2014 as such it furnishes the primary source for their construction. We are satisfied that \u00a7 7A is limited to contracts framed thereunder and that where a municipality resorts to public transportation under \u00a7 7B to bus its pupils, the competitive bidding features of \u00a7 7A do not apply as a condition precedent to engaging the public carrier or to obtaining reimbursement. It is also apparent from the record that Union Street made no attempt to bid on the contract, that the committee did not regard Union Street\u2019s submission as a bid, and that the committee would look only to \u00a7 7B for reimbursement of the cost of Union Street\u2019s services. In the absence of a specific provision in \u00a7 7B requiring that bidding procedures be followed, such procedures are not to be implied, but it is to be inferred that the contract (if one is involved)<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> is to be left to the reason<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>able judgment of the municipal agency charged with responsibility therefor. See <em>Archambault </em>v. <em>Mayor of Lowell, </em>278 Mass. 327, 332 (1932), and cases cited; 10 McQuillin, Municipal Corporations \u00a7 29.31, at 328-329 (3d ed. 1966). <em>Deary </em>v. <em>Dudley, </em>343 Mass. 192, 194 (1961). Cf. <em>Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Burlington, </em>3 Mass. App. Ct. 399, 402 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">3. There is no merit to the argument that the committee\u2019s votes on August 2 and 9, 1977, were improper. The agreement establishing the school district and the committee\u2019s rules make it clear that the quorum for transaction of business shall be a majority of the committee and that no action shall carry unless it shall receive the vote of a majority of the committee\u2019s members. See <em>Third Sch. Dist. in Stoughton </em>v. <em>Atherton, </em>12 Met. 105, 111-112 (1846). Likewise, the rejection of all the bids submitted under \u00a7 7A was proper under the rights reserved by the committee to reject \u201cany or all bids.\u201d See <em>Deary </em>v. <em>Dudley, supra </em>at 194; 10 McQuillin, Municipal Corporations, <em>supra </em>\u00a7 29.77.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b586-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b576-11\"> The Greater New Bedford Regional Vocational Technical High School District was formed on February 25,1972, in accordance with G.

App. Ct. 158, 163 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">In addition, pertinent portions of regulations adopted by the United States Department of Transportation to implement the requirements of 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 1602a(b) (1973) (see note 14, <em>supra) </em>were introduced in evidence. See 49 C.F.R., Part 605 (1976) \u2014 \u201cSchool Bus Operations.\u201d These regulations exempt \u201ctripper service\u201d from the general ban against school ,bus operations by public carriers. 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 605.13 (1976). \u201cTripper service\u201d means regularly scheduled mass transportation service which is open to the public and which is designed or modified to accommodate the needs of school children using various fare collection and subsidy systems so long as the buses carrying students are clearly marked as being available to the general public and stop only at regular service stops and travel routes included in the operator\u2019s published schedules. 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 605.3 (1976). The evidence warranted findings that SERTA\u2019s plan complied with the various requirements of \u201ctripper service.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b584-6\"> We see nothing in <em>Chicago Transit Authy. </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>607 F.2d 1284 (7th Cir. 1979), cert. denied sub nom. <em>Chicago Transit Authy. </em>v. <em>Goldschmidt, </em>446 U.S. 946 (1980), which is inconsistent with our analysis or conclusions because the type of system and the schedule involved in that case were materially different from the plan we have considered. Nor do we consider the record adequate to pass on the question (which is not seriously pressed by any of the parties on appeal) whether SERTA\u2019s operations are exempt from the effect of \u00a7 7C by virtue of the grandfather provisions contained in St. 1976, c. 518, \u00a7 2.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b585-8\"> We need not express an opinion on whether the arrangement in this case resulted in a contract between the committee and SERTA. See G. L. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>c. 40, \u00a7 4; c. 161B, \u00a7 <em>6(f). </em>It appears from the evidence at the trial that neither of these parties regarded itself mutually bound by any agreement but that the committee would only pay for bus tickets actually used. What is important \u2014 and is clear from the evidence \u2014 is that no contract was executed pursuant to the requirements of \u00a7 <em>7A.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b586-8\"> There is no necessity to discuss the judge\u2019s ruling with respect to the plaintiffs\u2019 bid preparation costs because nothing has been included in the judgment on that claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
