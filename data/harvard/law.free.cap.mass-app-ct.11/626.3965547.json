Both defendants are sued individually and as trustees of Elm Street Realty Trust.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b650-13\">Dreben, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AqC\">A judgment, entered after adoption of a master\u2019s report, did not include a provision recommended by the master that the defendants be removed as cotrustees of a trust. The plaintiff appeals, claiming that the judgment was impermissibly inconsistent with the report. We affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-14\">The plaintiff and his wife<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> established the Elm Street Realty Trust in 1971. The income beneficiaries were the donors and their two sons, who are the defendants in this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>action, and the remainder beneficiaries were the two sons. All four beneficiaries were named as trustees. The trust instrument gives the trustees the power to amend or terminate the trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">Friction developed between the plaintiff and his sons, and in 1976 he brought this action claiming a breach of fiduciary duties by the sons. He sought, inter alia, an accounting and the removal of his sons as cotrustees. The matter was referred to a master, and his report was adopted. Mass.R.Civ.P. 53(e)(2), 365 Mass. 820 (1974). Amotion by the defendants to strike portions of the report was denied. The report contained numerous subsidiary findings which effectively disposed of most of the plaintiffs claims. However, the master\u2019s \u201cGeneral and Ultimate Findings\u201d concluded that the defendants individually have \u201cpersonal interests<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> which are adverse\u201d to the plaintiff s beneficial interest, that \u201chostility exists\u201d between the plaintiff and the defendants \u201cthat is inimical to a fair administration of their duties by [the sons] as co-trustees of the trust . . .,\u201d and \u201cI find that in the best interest of the plaintiff ... as a lifetime income beneficiary of the trust the defendants . . . [should] be removed as co-trustees.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">A judgment was entered (by a judge other than the judge who adopted the report) which included certain of the master\u2019s recommendations<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> but which failed to remove the sons as cotrustees. Since the plaintiff s brief addresses only the failure of the judgment to remove his sons as cotrustees, we discuss only that issue. Mass.R.A.P. 16(a) (4), as amended, 367 Mass. 921 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b652-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>The plaintiff urges that the judgment was inconsistent with the master\u2019s report, and, citing <em>Kasper </em>v. <em>H. P. Hood &amp; Sons, </em>291 Mass. 24, 25 (1935), argues that the second judge was bound by the master\u2019s ultimate findings and conclusions \u201cunless the subsidiary findings included in the report are sufficient in themselves to demonstrate that the conclusion must be unsound in law.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>We think the plaintiff does not perceive the issue before us. The question here is not whether the judge is free to reject the master\u2019s ultimate findings of fact and to draw his own inferences from the master\u2019s subsidiary findings.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> What is here involved is whether the judge acting on the report is required to accept a master\u2019s recommendation as to the remedy in circumstances where the remedy is one which is left to the judge\u2019s sound discretion. To give the master\u2019s disposition any weight beyond that of a recommendation would be an abdication of the judicial function. \u201cThe main object of referring a suit to a master is to have the facts settled by him . . ..\u201d <em>Peters </em>v. <em>Wallach, </em>366 Mass. 622, 626 (1975), quoting from <em>Shelburne Shirt Co. </em>v. <em>Singer, </em>322 Mass. 262, 265 (1948). The confirmation of a master\u2019s report simply establishes the facts in an action, and it remains for the trial judge to enter the proper judgment on the facts as found and on the law as applied thereto. <em>Foot </em>v. <em>Bauman, </em>333 Mass. 214, 219 (1955). In proposing relief, the master went beyond the matters referred to him. \u201cHis rulings or suggestions concerning what would be a proper [judgment] were outside the scope of his duty.\u201d <em>Dowd </em>v. <em>Capetown House, Inc., </em>353 Mass. 244, 246 (1967). Greaney, Trials Before Masters: A Procedural and Substantive Primer for the Practicing Lawyer, 63 Mass. L. Rev. 195, 207 (1978). The master\u2019s conclusions of law do not determine the legal effect of the facts found by him and, a fortiori, do not determine the choice of remedy where such choice lies within the discretion of the trial judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>A petition for the removal of a trustee \u201cis addressed to the reasonable discretion of the court.\u201d <em>Shirk </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>298 Mass. 251, 259 (1937), and cases cited. See also G. L. c. 203, \u00a7 12.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Removal is not required, as matter of law, even where there is hostility between the trustees and the beneficiaries. This is particularly true where, as here, the donor himself has chosen the trustees. <em>Shirk </em>v. <em>Walker, supra </em>at 259. As the court pointed out in that case, at 260, \u201cWe do not doubt that such hostility may sometimes, in and of itself, be a sufficient cause for removal, although the trustee is without fault [citation omitted]. But the existence of hostile feeling on the part of beneficiaries,\u201d and we add, or on the part of the trustees, or both, \u201cdoes not relieve the court of its duty to exercise its best judgment under all the circumstances.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">There is here no indication that the judge failed to do so, and we cannot conclude that his decision was erroneous. <em>Weiss </em>v. <em>Weiss, </em>354 Mass. 761 (1968). The sons were also beneficiaries of the trust and, in fact, had a larger beneficial interest than did the plaintiff, as they were remaindermen. In the absence of a reconciliation as long as either the plaintiff or his sons were acting as trustees, there would be hostility between the beneficiaries and the trustees. Moreover, the trust instrument permits the trustees (at least the original trustees) to terminate the trust. The judge could well have concluded that permitting the sons to continue as trustees left it open to the parties to resolve their difficulties through the negotiation of a termination of the trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">Accordingly, we perceive no error in the failure to remove the sons as trustees.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b650-16\"> The wife of the plaintiff (the mother of the defendants) was originally a plaintiff, but the action, on her motion, was dismissed as to her.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b651-7\"> Corporations, the stock of which is owned individually by the sons (a gift from their father), leased the property owned by the trust.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b651-8\"> The master also stated: \u201cI find that the plaintiff ... is to be permanently enjoined from interfering with the quiet enjoyment of the trust property rented to the taxi co. and the liquor co.
