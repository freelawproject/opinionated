Three were drug related (from which no appeal has been claimed). The other offenses, alleged to have taken place on July 26, 1979, were (a) being a disorderly person, G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 53, as amended through St. 1973, c. 1073, \u00a7 20,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and (b) carry<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>ing without authority \u201con his [sic] person or under his [sic] control in a motor vehicle a dangerous weapon,\u201d G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10(h), as appearing in St. 1975, c. 585, \u00a7 l.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Testimony from members of the Worcester police \u201cvice-squad\u201d permitted the following findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">Two police officers, in each of two unmarked cruisers, saw the defendant about midnight walking on Piedmont Street, a two-lane street in Worcester. They (one with the assistance of binoculars) observed her from a distance of 200 to 300 feet for about twenty-five minutes, as she stopped with hand signals four automobiles, each with a lone male operator. She engaged each operator in conversation for about a minute. Other traffic in significant volume was forced to go around the stopped automobiles. She stopped a fifth automobile near the intersection of Murray Avenue and Piedmont Street. After a brief conversation between her and the vehicle\u2019s operator, this vehicle was driven onto <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>Murray Avenue where it stopped. The defendant entered the vehicle, which then went into a driveway near number 8 Preston Street. The officers left their cruisers and proceeded on foot down Preston Street. They found the defendant and the male operator of the vehicle fifty feet from the street \u201con the right side of ... 8 Preston Street, on the lawn area.\u201d That wooden house, three stories high, \u201cappeared to be\u201d occupied. After some quiet conversation, she started to remove the man\u2019s trousers and they were \u201c[ajround his knees\u201d when the police reached the area. The police put the defendant under arrest as \u201ca disorderly person\u201d and gave her a <em>Miranda </em>warning. They found in her handbag, large enough to \u201ccarry half a dozen grapefruit in it,\u201d what appeared to be a small kitchen bread knife with a blade eight inches long and some drugs and drug equipment, including a hypodermic needle, a syringe and a \u201cbottle cap cooker\u201d. Before the defendant entered the automobile, and after she left it, she was not heard to yell or scream. She did not run into the street in front of any vehicle to stop it. No automobile stopped on Preston Street while the arrest was going on and no one called out from the house.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-5\">1. On the \u201cdisorderly person\u201d complaint, defense counsel made objection only to the judge\u2019s instruction to the effect \u201cthat soliciting sexual contact or conduct would amount to the crime of disorderly person\u201d. He also had instructed that \u201c[ajctive solicitation of illicit sexual activity has been termed . . . disorderly\u201d and that \u201c[sjexual conduct in public [as opposed to such conduct in private] has been termed disorderly\u201d. He further said that such conduct, if \u201cdone in a public place, in a public manner . . . could be, if you should so decide, disorderly conduct\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-6\">\u201c[Disorderly persons\u201d, as used in G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 53, as amended through St. 1973, c. 1073, \u00a7 20, has been strictly construed to preserve it from the defect of unconstitutional vagueness (see <em>Alegata </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>353 Mass. 287, 303-304 [1967]) by incorporating in it by reference the provisions of the Model Penal Code \u00a7 250.2, at 223 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>(Proposed Official Draft, 1962), now found in Model Penal Code, Part II, at 324 et seq. [1980]).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> As so interpreted, it is not primarily, if at all, directed at offensive sexual conduct and indeed the instances of its recent application have been in Massachusetts largely confined to intentional conduct, usually somewhat violent, which tends to \u201cdisturb the public tranquility, or alarm or provoke others\u201d. See <em>Alegata, supra </em>at 304; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. A <em>Juvenile, </em>368 Mass. 580, 582, 592, 597-598 (1975, dealing with outbursts of violent and abusive language in a large department store, where \u00a7 53, as applied to speech less objectionable and less risk-creating than \u201cfighting words,\u201d was held constitutionally overbroad); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Richards, </em>369 Mass. 443, 446-448 (1976, force and violence against police officers, attracting a crowd). Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Orlando, </em>371 Mass. 732, 734 (1977, prosecution under \u00a7 53 for the separate [see note 1, <em>supra, </em>and the <em>Orlando </em>case, <em>supra </em>at 732] crime of \u201cdisturbers of the peace\u201d). There the evidence showed that the then defendant \u201churled objects and verbally insulted individuals at approximately 11:45 p.m. near \u2018The Pub\u2019 in Walpole.\u201d Compare also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jarrett, </em>359 Mass. 491, 492, 497-498 (1971), where the complaints for disturbing the peace alleged that the defendants did so by \u201cmaking loud noises and outcries and . . . uttering in a loud tone, threatening, abusive, profane, indecent, and violent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>language and . . . striking . . . grievous blows at divers persons.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b774-5\">In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Templeman, </em>376 Mass. 533, 537 (1978), \u201clewd, wanton and lascivious persons\u201d in \u00a7 53 was \u201climited to \u2018public\u2019 conduct in the same sense as the \u2018disorderly persons\u2019 provision.\u201d The opinion points out that Massachusetts \u201cdecisions have sometimes blurred the distinctions between the various categories [in \u00a7 53] and [that] \u2018idle and disorderly has sometimes been equated with \u2018lewd, wanton and lascivious.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 536-537. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. A <em>Juvenile (No. 2), 6 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 194, 196-197 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b774-6\">Consideration of the propriety of the trial judge\u2019s charge concerning the \u201cdisorderly person\u201d complaint is further complicated by the fact that \u00a7 53 contains a specific penalty (added by St. 1959, c. 304, \u00a7 1, on the basis of 1959 House Doc. Nos. 1967 and 2797) for \u201cprostitution,\u201d an offense not included in the present complaint. This 1959 provision, like other offenses mentioned in \u00a7 53, \u201cdoes not create or define [a] new crime . . . but rather prescribes penalties for the commission of acts previously recognized as criminal offenses.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>King, </em>374 Mass. 5, 11-12 (1977). Nevertheless, the 1959 enactment suggests that sexual solicitation and prostitution (and conduct from which the latter may be inferred) properly should be prosecuted under the 1959 provision rather than under the \u201cdisorderly persons\u201d provision, which (as redefined in the <em>Alegata </em>case) seems to require proof at least of significant risk of violence or serious disturbance. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Templeman, </em>376 Mass. at 537, where it was said \u201cwith respect to a \u2018disorderly person\u2019 charge . . . [there must be] a purpose to cause \u2018public\u2019 inconvenience, annoyance, or alarm, or . . . reckless creation of a risk thereof.\u201d In the circumstances of the present case, these conditions (if they existed at all) were not fully satisfied, and the ultimate arrest was not shown to have been \u201cin a place to which the public or a substantial group has access.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b774-7\">Framing an adequate and accurate charge under any one of the discrete (but sometimes overlapping) offenses men<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>tioned in \u00a7 53 is not an enviable assignment for any trial judge. Section 53 has been much amended. It deals with a considerable number of less important offenses, most if not all of which are defined only by the common law. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brasher, </em>359 Mass. 550, 554-555 (1971). The section in recent years has been limited and indeed altered, by judicial decisions, some of which have involved constitutional considerations. The section obviously is badly in need of careful legislative attention and comprehensive revision and rearranging.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-5\">The trial judge\u2019s task is rendered particularly difficult when defense counsel fail to file written requests for instructions and make imprecise objections to the judge\u2019s charge as given. Probably, also, the trial judge would have been greatly assisted in framing an appropriate charge (or in making a suitable disposition of the two complaints here discussed) if defense counsel had filed, and argued intelligibly, motions for required findings. Mass.R.Crim.P. 25(a), 378 Mass. 896 (1979). With full recognition of the matters just mentioned, we conclude that the charge in the present case inadequately defined the current content of the offense of being a \u201cdisorderly person\u201d, even when the charge is viewed as a whole.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The language from the charge already quoted unduly emphasized the extent, <em>if any, </em>to which the \u201cdisorderly persons\u201d provision, under our case law, has present application to sexual conduct. We lay emphasis on the circumstance that no complaint was before the trial court under the \u201ccommon night walkers,\u201d the \u201clewd, wanton, or lascivious persons,\u201d or the \u201cprostitutes\u201d portions of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>\u00a7 53.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> There is no occasion to decide whether the evidence would have supported a conviction on any one or more of these elements of \u00a7 53. The judge\u2019s charge also gave no attention to the part of the <em>Alegata </em>case, 353 Mass. at 304, redefining the \u201cdisorderly persons\u201d provision of \u00a7 53 in terms of \u00a7 250.2 of the Model Penal Code. See note 3, <em>sup</em>ra.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The conviction under \u00a7 53 must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-5\">2. We turn to the complaint under G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10(b) (see note 2, supra), against the defendant for carrying on her person or under her control in a motor vehicle a dangerous weapon. The Commonwealth concedes that the knife found in the defendant\u2019s large handbag is not a type of knife which always constitutes a dangerous weapon as specified in the opening lines of G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10(b). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Appleby, </em>380 Mass. 296, 303-308 (1980). Consequendy, carrying this knife (even though it could inflict a nasty puncture wound) would not warrant a prosecution under \u00a7 10(b) unless the defendant was armed with it or had it on her person, or had it on her person or under her control in a vehicle, (a) \u201cwhen arrested upon a warrant for\u201d crime, or (b) \u201cwhen arrested while committing a breach or disturbance of the public peace.\u201d The complaint on its face discloses that the police had no warrant for the defendant\u2019s arrest, but does not allege that, when she was arrested, she was \u201ccommitting a breach or disturbance of the public peace.\u201d This is a necessary element of any crime under \u00a7 10(b) involving this knife. The complaint is inadequate on its face for it does not charge any crime. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>Certainly the defendant could not have been prosecuted under \u00a7 10(h) for carrying this knife on her person, or on her person or under her control in a vehicle, for an innocent purpose (e.g. to cut bread at a picnic). The trial judge should have ruled to this effect, even in the absence of a request for a required finding under Mass.R.Crim.P. 25(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b777-5\">In view of this conclusion, there is no occasion to consider whether the trial judge gave an adequate charge on what constitutes a breach or disturbance of the peace. See the <em>Orlando </em>case, <em>supra </em>at 734-735.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-6\">The judgments in both cases are reversed. In the case under \u00a7 10(h), a judgment also is to be entered for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b770-15\"> Section 53, as thus amended, reads: <em>\u201cCommon night walkers, </em>both male and female, common railers and brawlers, persons who with often<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>sive and disorderly act or language accost or annoy persons of the opposite sex, <em>lewd, wanton and lascivious persons </em>in speech or behavior, <em>idle and disorderly persons, prostitutes, disturbers of the peace, </em>keepers of noisy and disorderly houses and persons guilty of indecent exposure may be punished by imprisonment in a jail or house of correction for not more than six months, or by a fine of not more than two hundred dollars, or by both such fine and imprisonment\u201d (emphasis supplied).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b771-7\"> Section 10(h), as thus amended, reads in part: <em>\u201c(b) </em>Whoever, except as provided by law, carries on his person, or carries on his person or under his control in a vehicle, any <em>stiletto, dagger, dirk knife, any knife having a double-edged blade, or a switch knife, or any knife having an automatic spring release device </em>by which the blade is released frorq the handle, having a blade of over one and one-half inches, ... or <em>whoever, when arrested upon a warrant for an alleged crime, or when arrested while committing a breach or disturbance of the public peace, is armed with or has on his person, or has on his person or under his control in a vehicle, a billy or other dangerous weapon other than those herein mentioned and those mentioned </em>in paragraph <em>(a) </em>[certain firearms] shall be punished by imprisonment for not less than two and one-half years nor-more than five years in the'state prison, or for not less than six months nor more than two and one-half years in a jail or house of correction, except that, if the court finds that the defendant has not been previously convicted of a felony, he may be punished by a fine of not more than fifty dollars or by imprisonment for not more than two and one-half years in a jail or house of correction\u201d (emphasis supplied).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b773-5\"> As appearing in the 1962 Proposed Official Draft, the section reads: \u201cSection 250.2 Disorderly Conduct. (1) <em>Offense Defined. A </em>person is guilty of disorderly conduct if, with purpose to cause public inconvenience, annoyance or alarm, or recklessly creating a risk thereof, he: (a) engages in fighting or threatening, or in violent or tumultuous behavior; or (b) makes unreasonable noise or offensively coarse utterance, gesture or display, or addresses abusive language to any person present; or (c) creates a hazardous or physically offensive condition by any act which serves no legitimate purpose of the actor. \u2018Public\u2019 means affecting or likely to affect persons in a place to which the public or a substantial group has access; among the places included are highways, transport facilities, schools, prisons, apartment houses, places of business or amusement, or any neighborhood.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b775-6\"> In addition to the portions of the charge already quoted, the trial judge said of the relevant part of \u00a7 53, \u201cThat is based on a statute that comes down to us from colonial times. It has been . . . interpreted and reinterpreted because it is a sort of a catch-all statute .... It covers lots of different types of conduct that goes against the good order of the community .... The particular charge that this defendant is being charged with here is what is called a disorderly person. The Supreme Court has said that a disorderly person is one who tends to disturb the public, who does things that upset the normal good order of our society, that provokes people, that causes alarm, that is the kind of thing.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b776-6\"> No assistance is derived (in defining the crime here discussed) from the form of complaint suggested in G. L. c. 277, \u00a7 79, for use in prosecuting the offenses of being an \u201cidle and disorderly person.\u201d Compare <em>Thomes </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>355 Mass. 203, 205-206 (1969); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brasher, </em>359 Mass. 550, 554-555 (1971). The suggested form of complaint bears no close resemblance to the offense as redefined in the <em>Alegata </em>case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b776-7\"> Indeed, that redefinition casts serious doubt on whether the \u201cdisorderly persons\u201d portion of \u00a7 53 now retains any element of prohibition of sexual misconduct (where all such conduct is dealt with in other sections of the Model Penal Code).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
