As to the primary issue argued by the parties, the instant case is controlled by <em>Naukeag Inn, Inc. </em>v. <em>Rideout, </em>351 Mass. 353, 356 (1966), which held that broad general releases drawn \u201cin terms sufficiently comprehensive\u201d discharge all existing claims, whether disclosed or undisclosed. Here the release which Amoco Oil Company (Amoco) gave to its service station tenant, Raymond S. Lee (Lee), discharged Lee from \u201call claims ... of any kind whatsoever . . . whether known or unknown, which it now has, ever had, or hereafter may claim to have had, from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"833\">*833</page-number>beginning of time to the date hereof . . . .\u201d To the extent that the release referred to the resolution of the particular dispute then being resolved, it did so expressly \u201cwithout limiting the generality of the foregoing.\u201d If exceptions to the release were intended, they should have been stated. See <em>Radovsky </em>v. <em>Wexler, </em>273 Mass. 254, 258 (1930); <em>Naukeag Inn, Inc. </em>v. <em>Rideout, </em>351 Mass. at 356; <em>LaFontaine </em>v. <em>Fillela, </em>7 Mass. App. Ct. 870, 871 (1979). Contrast <em>Commissioner of Ins. </em>v. <em>Bristol Mut. Liab. Ins. Co., </em>279 Mass. 325, 333-334 (1932).</p>\n<p id=\"b857-5\">2. It is no answer to the application of the familiar principles restated above to say that the claim for contribution which Amoco seeks to press against Lee did not mature until that date, after the release, upon which Amoco paid a judgment on a tort claim to Sword &amp; Shield Restaurant, Inc. (Sword &amp; Shield). Although it is Amoco\u2019s position that it could not bring an action against Lee for contribution until it had paid more than its share of Sword &amp; Shield\u2019s claim, that action would have \u201cits roots in the underlying incident which gives rise to the personal injury.\u201d <em>Coulson </em>v. <em>Larsen, </em>94 Wis. 2d 56, 59-60 (1980). So while a cause of action for contribution may not be ripe until a joint tortfeasor has paid more than his share of a judgment, the inchoate right to contribution comes into being when the \u201cunderlying incident\u201doccurs. See <em>Markey </em>v. <em>Skog, </em>129 N.J. Super. 192, 200 (1974). Here the underlying incident involved a leaking gasoline storage tank from which gasoline seeped into Sword &amp; Shield\u2019s basement, an event which occurred six days before Amoco and Lee exchanged releases. Although the existence of Sword &amp; Shield\u2019s claim may not have been known to the persons who signed and delivered the release of Lee on behalf of Amoco, that release by its terms included \u201call claims, demands, causes of action, and liabilities of any kind whatsoever (upon any legal or equitable theory, whether contractual, common law, statutory, federal, state or otherwise) <em>whether known or unknown </em>...\u201d (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b857-6\">Moreover, G. L. c. 231B, \u00a7 4(b), inserted by St. 1962, c. 730, \u00a7 .1, provides that, \u201c[wjhen a release ... is given-in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"834\">*834</page-number>good faith to one of two or more persons liable in tort for the same injury . . . [i]t shall discharge the tortfeasor to whom it is given from all liability for contribution to any other tortfeasor.\u201d The releases, incident to settlement, referred to are prejudgment releases. See <em>Bishop </em>v. <em>Klein, </em>380 Mass. 285, 292-295 (1980). The statute refers to prejudgment releases of a tortfeasor by a claimant. The case for honoring a release by which one joint tortfeasor, as here, discharges the other is even stronger since the rights of parties are not in any way established by the actions of a third party. We recognize that the legislative purpose behind c. 23IB is to avoid having one of two or more joint tortfeasors bear a disproportionate share of a plaintiff\u2019s recovery. <em>Hayon </em>v. <em>Coca Cola Bottling Co., 375 </em>Mass. 644, 648 (1978). It does no violence to that objective of equitable distribution of tort burdens, however, to allow tortfeasors, <em>among themselves, </em>to release one of their number. See generally 12 U.L.A. \u00a7 4, Comment of the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws, at 99-100 (Master ed. 1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b858-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
