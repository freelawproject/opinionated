L. c. 71, \u00a7 42, may seem less than fateful. However, taken together over a twelve-month period those transgressions, if proved, justified the school committee\u2019s decision, made June 20,1978, to dismiss Springgate, a tenured teacher, for incapacity, conduct unbecoming a teacher and insubordination. Spring-gate appealed (G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 43A, as amended through St. 1977, c. 671) from the school committee\u2019s decision to dismiss her. A Superior Court judge, after trial, found the school committee\u2019s discharge of Springgate was not justified and entered judgment reinstating her. From this judgment the school committee has appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">We think the judge erred in finding the charges vague and trivial within the meaning of G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 42, and that he erred in his findings that no credible evidence substantiated the charges. Accordingly, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">1. <em>Constitutionality of judicial review of school committee discharge decisions. </em>Apparently stimulated so to do by an aside of Justice Whittemore in <em>MacKenzie </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Ipswich, </em>342 Mass. 612, 616 (1961),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the school committee questions the constitutionality of G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 43A, which authorizes the Superior Court to hear a teacher discharge de novo, on the ground that the judiciary is made to trespass on executive prerogatives.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-7\">Review is not managerial in nature, however; review is quintessential^ judicial and management is executive in quality. The statute does not invest the court with power to establish criteria for dismissing a teacher and initiating proceedings. Rather the statute confers upon the court the limited function of determining whether the school commit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>tee acted on the evidence rather than out of bias, political pressure, or other improper motive. Moreover, as a tenured teacher, Springgate was entitled under G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 42, to written, charges, a public hearing, the presentation of evidence, and the right to be represented by counsel. These duties, which are required of a school committee in connection with the discharge of a tenured teacher, are characteristic of those incident to a judicial investigation. That such functions should be subject to judicial review \u201crequires no argument.\u201d <em>Driscoll </em>v. <em>Mayor of Somerville, </em>213 Mass. 493, 494 (1913).</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">We do not think that conferring upon the court de novo review, whereby the findings of fact of the school committee carry no evidentiary weight, alters the case. The function of the court is still no more than review, i.e., determining whether the evidence substantiates the charges made by the school committee. In this respect the task of the court is not unlike that which it performs in hearing appeals from the grant or denial of zoning variances or special permits, which also involve de novo review. <em>Pendergast </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Barnstable, </em>331 Mass. 555, 558-559 (1954). <em>Josephs </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Brookline, </em>362 Mass. 290, 295 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">2. <em>Scope of appellate review. </em>Since <em>Doherty </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Boston, </em>6 Mass. App. Ct. 805, 810-812 (1979), we have heard cases initiated under G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 43A, on direct appeal from the final judgment in the Superior Court, thus jettisoning \u201cunnecessary traditional baggage\u201d of certiorari. See <em>Loring Hills Developers Trust </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of Salem, </em>374 Mass. 343, 350 (1978). Compare <em>MacKenzie </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Ipswich, </em>342 Mass. at 613-614.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-7\">In discharge cases under \u00a7 43A, where the trial judge is not confined to reviewing a record, but conducts a hearing de novo, and where the statute provides that \u201c[t]he decision of the [Superior] court shall be final, except as to matters of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>law,\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> an appellate court is confined to examination of determinations of law by the trial judge and whether the judge\u2019s findings of fact pass the clearly erroneous test. See <em>South Middlesex Regional Vocational Technical School Dist. Comm. </em>v. <em>Superior </em>Court, 9 Mass. App. Ct. 372, 375 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">3. <em>Vagueness of the charges. </em>As matter of law the judge erred in concluding that six of the eleven charges brought by the school committee were insufficiently definite and failed to refer to specific acts which might fall within the ambit of the discharge criteria in G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 42: \u201cinefficiency, incapacity, conduct unbecoming a teacher or superintendent, insubordination or other good cause.\u201d The six charges which the judge found wanting were as follows: \u201c(a) on or about May 15, 1977, Ms. Springgate disrupted the class of another teacher (Miss McQuillan) looking for Tr[ea]nor English books; (b) on or about May 15, 1977, Ms. Spring-gate disrupted the class of another teacher (Miss Aiken) looking for Tr[ea]nor books . . .; (e) on or about December 15, 1977, Ms. Springgate disrupted another teacher\u2019s class (Miss McQuillan) and then went to another teacher\u2019s class (Miss Aiken), [and] disrupted that class .... Later that day Ms. Springgate disrupted Miss Aiken\u2019s class again looking for a film strip projector; (f) on or about December 15, 1977, Ms. Springgate was argumentative and overbearing with the librarian; (g) on or about February 14, 1978, Ms. Springgate was warned that any further unprofessional conduct would be grounds for her termination . . .; [and] (j) on or about March 21, 1978, Ms. Springgate was argumentative and overbearing with an aide (Mrs. Nancy Gauvin) and this conduct took place in front of students.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">With the exception of charge (g), which does not describe Springgate\u2019s conduct, but simply recites the fact of the committee\u2019s having warned her of unprofessional conduct,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>charges were sufficient in stating the dates on which Spring-gate was alleged to have had altercations with colleagues and others. In that they described specific incidents, the charges were less vague than those found sufficient in <em>Corrigan </em>v. <em>School Comm. of New Bedford, </em>250 Mass. 334, 335-336 (1924) (\u201cThe committee\u2019s dissatisfaction with her work and the belief that she has not demonstrated constructive leadership and necessary administrative capability\u201d); in <em>Toothaker </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Rockland, </em>256 Mass. 584, 591-592 (1926) (\u201cIn our opinion the lack of harmony and cooperation between the Committee and Superintendent is detrimental to the welfare of the schools\u201d); and in <em>Lower </em>v. <em>North Middlesex Regional Sch. Comm., </em>8 Mass. App. Ct. 536, 538 n.2 (1979) (\u201c[3] Your failure to observe protocol .... [4] The belief of the administration that your conduct is contraindicative to the building and maintaining of an efficient school system\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">4. <em>Sufficiency of the charges. </em>The trial judge ruled that all eleven charges amounted to no more than a collection of petty complaints, \u201cpicayune, miniscule matters\u201d which did not \u201cconstitute adequate grounds for dismissal of a teacher under the statute.\u201d It is not a judicial function, however, under G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 43A, to assess the gravity of a school committee\u2019s charges or the appropriateness or wisdom of its action. The permissible grounds for dismissal under G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 42 \u2014 inefficiency, incapacity, conduct unbecoming a teacher, insubordination, and other good cause \u2014 include any ground which is not arbitrary, irrational, unreasonable, in bad faith, or irrelevant to the committee\u2019s task of running a sound school system. <em>Rinaldo </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Revere, </em>294 Mass. 167, 169 (1936). <em>Faxon </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Boston, </em>331 Mass. 531, 534 (1954). <em>MacKenzie </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Ipswich, </em>342 Mass. at 614-615 &amp; 619. <em>Nutter </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Lowell, </em>5 Mass. App. Ct. 77, 81 (1977). <em>Lower </em>v. <em>North Middlesex Regional School Comm., </em>8 Mass. App. Ct. at 539.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">In the case at bar the school committee\u2019s charges, if proved, painted Springgate as abrasive in her relations with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>colleagues, disruptive of other teachers\u2019 classes and their relationships with school children, and less than candid with her superiors. This conduct spanned some considerable time and persisted in the face of informal and formal warnings to Springgate to modulate her conduct. A pattern of persistent disruptive behavior and clashes with colleagues, however minor each incident, which tends in the judgment of the school committee to interfere with the efficient operation of a school is reasonable ground for dismissal; it may be characterized as conduct unbecoming a teacher. Compare <em>MacKenzie </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Ipswich, </em>342 Mass. at 616-617, in which a single profane utterance by a veteran teacher was sufficient to sustain a charge of conduct unbecoming a teacher.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">5. <em>Substantiation of the charges. </em>Of the original eleven charges, the school committee found only one not proved.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> As to the remaining ten, the judge found none substantiated by a preponderance of credible evidence. Indeed, the judge expressly disbelieved all seven<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> of the committee\u2019s witnesses and credited the testimony of Springgate. The judge made findings of fact in favor of Springgate on the six charges he had determined were insufficiently definite as well as those four he regarded as adequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">Of course an appellate court does not set aside findings of fact unless they are clearly erroneous. Mass.R.Civ.P. 52 (a), 365 Mass. 816 (1974). \u201cA finding is \u2018clearly erroneous\u2019 when although there is evidence to support it, the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>United States Gypsum Co., </em>333 U.S. 364, 395 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>(1948). <em>C.C.&amp;T. Constr. Co. </em>v. <em>Coleman Bros., 8 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 133, 135 (1979). Smith &amp; Zobel, Rules Practice \u00a7 52.7 (1977). The credibility of witnesses, particularly, is a preserve of the trial judge upon which an appellate court treads with great reluctance. See <em>Matsushita Elec. Corp. of America v. Sonus Corp., </em>362 Mass. 246, 254 (1972). But it is not forbidden territory. There are exceptional cases \u201cwhere such findings have been changed in whole or in part on appeal, because plainly wrong.\u201d <em>Spiegel </em>v. <em>Beacon Participations, Inc., </em>297 Mass. 398, 407-408 (1937). We think this is such a case.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">As far as the trial judge was concerned, two officials acts of the school administration, taken well before the committee brought charges against Springgate, irrevocably \u201ctainted the integrity of the entire proceeding by the [sjchool [cjommittee against the plaintiff.\u201d The first of these was a written memorandum by the principal (one Reed) of the school in which Springgate taught which Reed sent to the committee and placed in Springgate\u2019s file. It recounted displays of \u201chostile emotion in front of students\u201d on December 15, 1977, in two classrooms and in the school library. That memorandum recommended to the committee that Springgate\u2019s salary increases be withheld for the following year because of her \u201cbreach of professionalism.\u201d The second official act flowed from the first. On February 14, 1978, the school committee sent a letter to Springgate which took note of the incidents of December 15, 1977, which warned her that the conduct reported to the committee would not be tolerated, and that \u201crecurrence of this type of disruptive behavior\u201d could be grounds for dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">From these two documents the judge drew the conclusion that Springgate\u2019s case had been prejudged, that \u201c[tjhis activity by the [sjchool [cjommittee . . . constitutes bad faith and ill will on their part toward the plaintiff,\u201d and that because of this bad faith the committee\u2019s action in dismissing Springgate was arbitrary. He found that \u201cthe [sjchool [cjommittee at some time prior to February 14, 1978, and on the basis of the undated letter from Mr. Reed, did find <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>the plaintiff \u2018guilty\u2019 of conduct unbecoming a teacher, unprofessionalism and disruptive behavior with reference to the incidents of December 15, 1977, as described in the Reed letter.\u201d Further the judge, again so far as the record discloses solely on the basis of the two documents,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> found the committee \u201cwere undertaking to pretend that they would conduct a fair hearing to the plaintiff re these charges, when in fact, the [cjommittee had, five months before, concluded the plaintiff was \u2018guilty\u2019 of these charges and therefore these issues had already been decided, without any hearing at all.\u201d We differ sharply with the judge on this score. On the contrary, the committee\u2019s warning to Springgate seems the decent thing to do. It bespeaks patience, an effort to avoid a parting of the ways, and a hope that Springgate might mend her ways. Neither the interests of teachers nor of school administration would be advanced if cautionary notice of unacceptable conduct precluded a school committee from subsequent disciplinary action.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">The misconception by the judge that the school committee\u2019s earlier warning obliged Springgate to play with a stacked deck may well be what led him to his remarkable rejection of the entire testimony of a parade of witnesses for the school committee and to accept virtually to the last detail the <em>testimony </em>of Springgate. A trier of fact need hardly be bound to an account of the facts testified to by the greatest number of witnesses. See <em>Gaffney </em>v. <em>Bay State St. Ry., </em>221 Mass. 457, 459 (1915). But here we are confronted with wholesale repudiation of seven witnesses whose interest in the outcome of the case was less personal and intense than that of one witness on the other side, Springgate, who had everything to gain or lose. In these peculiar circumstances we must, perforce, delve into the facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>The first two charges dealt with events of May 15, 1977, on which date Springgate, a fourth-grade teacher, is said to have barged into the classroom of two other fourth-grade teachers looking for Treanor books, a particular set of English training materials.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">There was evidence from McQuillan that Springgate asked for the books in a manner which interrupted her class and that when McQuillan said she didn\u2019t have the books Springgate stalked out and slammed the door. Aiken testified that Springgate similarly interrupted her class and that Springgate said in front of her pupils, \u201cI\u2019m sick of searching for books and sick of you.\u201d Both McQuillan and Aiken said they reported the incidents to Reed, the principal, a fact which the latter corroborated. According to McQuillan, Aiken, and Reed, a conference among them and Springgate took place later that day in Reed\u2019s office at which Spring-gate expressed regret about her \u201chuman error.\u201d Springgate admitted that the conference had occurred but denied any manifestation of contrition on her part. She denied any impoliteness.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">The judge\u2019s findings that Springgate was entirely civil on the occasion of each intrusion and that McQuillan\u2019s and Aiken\u2019s accounts were at best magnified and at worst invented are substantially undercut by the uncontroverted fact that on the very day of the occurrences, Aiken and Mc-Quillan were sufficiently upset to report the incident and that the school principal thought the affair sufficiently serious to hold a peacemaking session.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-7\">On November 3, 1977, there occurred an incident involving the disciplining of an eleven year old student, Thomas Guard, in the course of which, according to young Guard and his father, Springgate pushed him in front of other pupils and said to him, \u201cYoung man, you were caught by the police the other day. You should know better.\u201d Spring-gate denied the push and the statement. As between the testimony of the boy and his father and that of Springgate we are certainly in no better position to make a finding than the judge. The judge found nothing said by either of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>Guards credible and accepted Springgate\u2019s version in its entirety. What is remarkable about Springgate\u2019s testimony, however, is that she denied flatly that she ever had a talk with the school principal, Reed, about the matter. Yet Reed testified that he had received a telephone call at home from Guard, Sr., complaining about the incident and it is hardly to be imagined that Reed would not thereafter have discussed it with Springgate. Reed testified that, indeed, he did. Thus while we are not prepared to upset the judge\u2019s finding that the charge based on the Guards\u2019 complaint was not proved, we think his wholehearted acceptance of Springgate\u2019s version is suggestive of his view of the over-all evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">Two charges were levelled concerning events said to have occurred on December 15, 1977, and those events can be treated in a cluster. That day\u2019s tempest began, according to McQuillan, with Springgate coming into her room during class time to look for teaching aids called plus-ten materials. McQuillan replied she had used them two days earlier and had wheeled them (plus-ten materials were kept on a cart) to Aiken\u2019s room. According to McQuillan, Springgate then departed with the remark, \u201cI don\u2019t have much time and I\u2019m sick of chasing down material,\u201d and a slam of the door. Aiken testified that she was about to use plus-ten materials and was passing out materials to her children, when Spring-gate came into her room \u201cturned to me and said she was taking the cart\u201d and \u201cwheeled the cart right out the door.\u201d Later that morning, Aiken said, she was again interrupted by Springgate, who this time asked about a filmstrip projector. Aiken said she did not have the projector but asked for the plus-ten cart back. Springgate\u2019s response according to Aiken was, \u201cNo, you can\u2019t. It is not your day.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">The other brouhaha of that day was testified to by the school librarian who testified to an agitated and agitating encounter with Springgate about the unavailability of a new filmstrip projector for which Springgate had signed up. According to the librarian\u2019s account, old filmstrip projectors were available, but this fact neither mollified Springgate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>nor deflected her from heated insistence on knowing which teachers had the new ones. Sufficient feeling was generated so that the librarian reported the matter to the principal and, suffice it to say, there was a session in the principal\u2019s office again that afternoon.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The principal thought the business was serious enough to reduce to writing and ordered that his report, which included a conclusion that Springgate had acted unprofessionally, be placed in her file.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">The judge found in effect that these encounters had occurred but that they had been nonabrasive. We find this hard to accept. Three individuals felt moved to complain to the school principal. The librarian made a written memorandum which was received in evidence.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> It is obvious something unsettling had happened. Remarkably, the judge infers from the evidence that McQuillan and Aiken, as the younger teachers, \u201cwere out to \u2018gang up on the plaintiff.\u2019\u201d Springgate did not say so in her testimony and even if the judge disbelieved Aiken and McQuillan, that disbelief cannot lead him to proof of some different proposition. So far as the quarrel with the librarian is concerned, the judge found Springgate more sinned against than sinning because there had been a mixup about who had first crack at the new equipment. Even were that so, a school committee could conclude that a teacher has overreacted to the inevitable irritants of daily work and that school morale has suffered as a consequence. We are of the opinion that the evidence concerning the events of December 15, 1977, substantiated the charges that Springgate disrupted Aiken\u2019s and McQuillan\u2019s classes in an impermissible fashion and that Springgate was argumentative and overbearing with the librarian in the presence of students.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>Additional spats between Springgate and a teacher\u2019s aide named Gauvin occurred on March 21, 1978, and between Springgate and McQuillan on March 24, 1978. As usual, there was a difference of view between Springgate and her accusers on the acerbity of the incidents and the degree to which students were affected. The March 24, 1978,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> episode occurred on a field trip to Sturbridge Village and involved a complaint that Springgate had been quarrelsome about collecting admission fees from her students, that she threw money at McQuillan and pushed and elbowed her. McQuillan reported the incident to the principal, who reported it in turn to the acting superintendent of schools. The judge accepted Springgate\u2019s version that there was no elbowing and body checking, but just a squeezing by in a bus aisle. Springgate concedes McQuillan said, \u201cMarjorie, please don\u2019t be nasty\u201d when the physical contact occurred. There is no controversy that Springgate\u2019s response was, \u201cNo comment.\u201d A dog knows the difference \u201cbetween being stumbled over and being kicked\u201d;<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> a person knows the difference between being bumped and shoved. It is hard to fathom why there would have been reasons for the irascible exchange between the two teachers if something had not happened. We do not accept the judge\u2019s finding that there was no evidence to substantiate the bus incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">We are not without some sympathy for the judge\u2019s irritation with the essential pettiness of the individual incidents in dispute. But as we have previously suggested, it appears the judge\u2019s view that the charges amounted, as he put it, to \u201ca major effort to \u2018make something out of nothing\u2019\u201d misinformed his review of the evidence. Even a witness called on Springgate\u2019s behalf (the only such witness other than Springgate herself), one Kozicki, testified that Springgate\u2019s \u201cweakness was in the area of her personality . . . .\u201d She de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>scribed her as one who \u201ccould be brus[que] in manner.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Our study of the testimony of all the witnesses and the documentary evidence persuades us that disbelief about the intrinsic importance of the conduct which the committee\u2019s witnesses described misled the judge into disbelieving the truth of what they said. Yet, the inability or unwillingness of a school teacher to eschew displays of rudeness and tactlessness in front of students and to work in a cooperative and civil manner with her colleagues can have a corrosive effect on the morale of a school\u2019s personnel and the respect with which those personnel are regarded by the pupils. Our view of the evidence is that it substantiated a sufficient number of the series of relatively minor incidents to justify the school committee\u2019s determination of incapacity or conduct unbecoming a teacher.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">The judgment is reversed and judgment is to be entered that the action of the school committee was justifiable.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b329-8\"> Describing judicial review under G.
