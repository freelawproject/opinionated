Despite the plaintiffs attempt to exercise the option, the defendants refused to convey the property, aiid the plaintiff brought this action for specific performance. The defendants moved for summary judgment, urging that the plaintiff had not unconditionally exercised the option, but, at most, had tendered a counteroffer which was never accepted. Affidavits were filed, and the trial judge entered summary judgment for the defendants. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-13\">The terms of the option are set forth in the margin.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> They required the tenant to notify the defendants in writing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>of his intent to exercise the option \u201cprior to 60 days before the expiration of this lease,\u201d that is, sixty days before October 25, 1978. The pleadings, affidavits and supporting documents submitted on behalf of the plaintiff<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> allege the following facts, which were not controverted by the defendants. Ernest B. Sheldon, a real estate broker, was hired by the defendants as a broker for the purpose of selling the property. On their behalf, he drafted the lease in 1976. In January 1978, Sheldon notified the defendants that \u201c[the plaintiff] wished to exercise his option and prepared a purchase and sale agreement in accordance with the parties\u2019 wishes\u201d which included the following provision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-5\">\u201cThis agreement constitutes written notice of intent to exercise the buyer\u2019s option to purchase contained in a lease agreement between the parties dated October 25, 1976 and by agreement conveyance is to take place according to this contract which incorporates and merges all of the rights set forth in said lease as they apply to either party.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">The agreement was sent to the defendants on January 17, 1978, more than nine months before the expiration of the lease. In his cover letter, Sheldon pointed out some of the substantive provisions of the agreement, including the fact that the agreement was contingent upon the buyer\u2019s being able to obtain a mortgage for $29,000.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Sheldon\u2019s affidavit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>alleged that the defendants refused to sign, that he had conversations with them and \u201con their instructions\u201d prepared a second and then a third agreement, each of which they also refused to sign. Thereafter, Sheldon advised the defendants that the plaintiff had obtained financing pending availability of funds and was told \u201cthis was acceptable\u201d and that the defendants \u201cwould go through with the sale\u201d and would deliver the signed agreements. The defendants did not sign the agreements, but instead left at Sheldon\u2019s office on January 25, 1979, a copy of a listing of the property with another broker at a price of $39,500.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">Viewing the affidavits filed by the parties and the inferences which may be drawn therefrom \u201cin the light most favorable\u201d to the party opposing summary judgment, <em>Hub Associates </em>v. <em>Goode, </em>357 Mass. 449, 451 (1970); <em>Stetson </em>v. <em>Selectmen of Carlisle, </em>369 Mass. 755, 763 (1976); <em>Salem Bldg. Supply Co. </em>v. <em>J.B.L. Constr. Co., </em>10 Mass. App. Ct. 360, 365 (1980); we conclude that the defendants have not met the burden of a party moving for summary judgment under Mass.R.Civ.P. 56(c), 365 Mass. 824 (1974). They have not shown that \u201cthere is no genuine issue of material fact and that [they are] entitled, as matter of law, to a judgment.\u201d <em>Community Natl. Bank </em>v. <em>Dawes, </em>369 Mass. 550, 554 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">The defendants\u2019 affidavit, when supplemented in its interstices by the affidavits filed by the plaintiff, shows that whether the plaintiff gave proper notice of his intent to exercise the option cannot be settled on this bare record. See <em>Ames v. B.C. Ames Co., </em>335 Mass. 511, 515 (1957) (finding that no counteroffer intended); <em>Rousseau </em>v. <em>Mesite, </em>355 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>Mass. 567, 570 (1969) (whether it was intention that agreement was to take effect only if Mesite could satisfy his creditors was a question of fact). The resolution of that basic issue depends on the factual question whether Sheldon had at least apparent authority to accept the plaintiff\u2019s notice of intent to exercise the option or to draft the notice. See <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Kelley, </em>342 Mass. 724, 727 (1961). See also <em>Noyes </em>v. <em>Quincy Mut. Fire Ins. Co., </em>7 Mass. App. Ct. 723, 725-726 (1979). The defendants did not deny Sheldon\u2019s agency, and, indeed, in their answer, admitted that he was their agent. The scope of his agency is, however, not clear. The question of the implied or apparent authority of Sheldon is one of fact and \u201cdepends upon the inferences to be drawn from a variety of circumstances\u201d relating to his conduct and \u201cwhether the circumstances are such as to warrant\u201d the plaintiff, \u201cin the exercise of reasonable prudence and discretion, to believe\u201d that Sheldon had authority to represent the defendants \u201cin regard to the transaction in question.\u201d <em>Lord </em>v. <em>Lowell Inst. for Sav., </em>304 Mass. 212, 214 (1939). <em>Costonis </em>v. <em>Medford Housing Authy., </em>343 Mass. 108, 113 (1961). <em>Salem, Bldg. Supply Co. </em>v. <em>J.B.L. Constr. Co., </em>10 Mass. App. Ct. at 365.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">Sheldon\u2019s affidavit also states that the first agreement was \u201cin accordance with the parties\u2019 wishes.\u201d Even if the facts at trial do not show that the conditions set forth in the January agreement were authorized by the defendants,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the plaintiff was not necessarily precluded from giving notice of an intent to exercise the option and also seeking to obtain more favorable terms. There is nothing \u201cinconsistent in the plaintiff\u2019s [exercise of the option] . . . and the conclusion thereby of a binding agreement with the effort afterwards to procure modifications of that agreement.\u201d <em>Beach &amp; </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number><em>Clarridge Co. </em>v. <em>American Steam Gauge &amp; Valve Mfg. Co., </em>208 Mass. 121, 131 (1911). See C <em>&amp; W Dyeing &amp; Cleaning Co. </em>v. <em>DeQuattro, </em>344 Mass. 739, 741 (1962). 1A Corbin, Contracts \u00a7 264, at 511, 523-524 (1963). Compare <em>Westinghouse Bdcst. Co. </em>v. <em>New England Patriots Football Club, Inc., </em>10 Mass. App. Ct. 70, 73-74 (1980). Sheldon\u2019s affidavit also warrants an inference that there was a subsequent waiver by the defendants of the inadequacy, if any, of the exercise of the option. See <em>Mayer </em>v. <em>Boston Metropolitan Airport, Inc. </em>355 Mass. 344, 353 (1969); <em>Louis Stoico, Inc. </em>v. <em>Colonial Dev. Corp., </em>369 Mass. 898, 903 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b110-4\">From the foregoing, it is apparent that there are here issues of material fact which preclude a determination on summary judgment that the plaintiff did not properly give notice of his intent to exercise the option. See <em>Stetson </em>v. <em>Selectmen of Carlisle, </em>369 Mass. at 763; <em>Salem Bldg. Supply Co. </em>v. <em>J.B.L. Constr. Co., </em>10 Mass. App. Ct. at 365; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Diebold, Inc., </em>369 U.S. 654, 655 (1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b106-15\">The lease dated October 25, 1976, provided: \u201cThe Lessors hereby grant the Lessee an option and right to purchase the demised premises at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>the expiration of this lease for the sum of $29,000. Notice in writing to the Lessors by the Lessee of its intent to exercise this option must be delivered to the Lessors prior to 60 days before the expiration of this lease, otherwise the option hereby granted to the Lessee shall be and stand cancelled. If notice of exercise of its option by the Lessee is received by the Lessors, conveyance of the property to the Lessee will be made within 30 days of the expiration of this lease upon payment of the agreed purchase price.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b107-9\"> We find it unnecessary to consider the affidavit submitted in support of the plaintiff s motion for reconsideration of the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment, and we only consider the material submitted to the judge prior to his initial ruling.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b107-10\"> The agreement drawn by Sheldon in January stated the agreed value of the premises was $38,000, \u201c$9,000 of which have been paid in goods and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>services.\" Sheldon subsequently drew two other agreements, each of which contained a statement that improvements of $9,000 were made by the buyer.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b108-10\">The option price was $29,000, and the following statement was contained in the lease: \u201cIt is agreed by the parties that money and labor spent by the Lessee on the premises is totally the Lessee\u2019s expense but that consideration by the Lessors of these expenses has been considered in setting the purchase option price.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b109-6\"> In support of their contention that the January agreement was a counteroffer, the defendants rely on the following three provisions of that agreement: (1) that the sale was contingent on the plaintiff\u2019s obtaining financing; (2) that passing of papers was to take effect on March 1,1978, i.e. before October 25,1978, see note 2, <em>supra; </em>and (3) that the price was contrary to the provisions of the option. See note 4, <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
