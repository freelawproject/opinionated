Claiming that he had acted in self-defense, Harrison appealed to the Boston Division of the Housing Court Department, St. 1970, c. 842, \u00a7 10, and G. L. c. 185C, \u00a7 3, while Driscoll brought an action in summary process; the two matters were consolidated for trial.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> See <em>Gentile </em>v. <em>Rent Control Bd. of Somerville, </em>365 Mass. 343, 350 (1974). The judge found that there was no just cause to evict Harrison. He annulled the board\u2019s decision and entered a judgment in Harrison\u2019s favor on the summary process complaint. We reverse the judgments.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">We relate the facts as the judge found them. Harrison had resided in his rent controlled apartment from the time Driscoll first acquired the sixteen unit building in 1965. The tenancy relationship had been uneventful and harmonious the entire time with the exception of the \u201cisolated incident\u201d in question, which occurred on June 6, 1978. That morning Harrison was late for work. As he was going to his car which was in the parking lot of the building, he saw that a truck was blocking his exit from the lot. Frank, who was employed by his father as a maintenance man, had arrived in the truck a short time earlier to collect rubbish. Harrison asked Frank to move his truck, and Frank asked Harrison why he had failed to report a leak in his apartment which had caused water to seep into the unit below his. Harrison denied knowledge of the leak, and a shouting match ensued. It quickly escalated into a physical altercation with \u201cboth individuals touch[ing] the other with their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>finger in a light pushing fashion.\u201d The \u201clight pushing,\u201d as well as the shouting, ended when Harrison took a four-foot closet pole from the trunk of his car and hit Frank in the shoulder with it.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">As to this entire episode, the judge found that neither of the men had been justified in touching the other, irrespective of who may have been the instigator, although the incident would not have occurred had Frank walked away from the argument and moved his truck. Focusing on the battery with the pole, the judge found that he was \u201cnot prepared to find with any degree of certainty that Mr. Harrison did not believe that he was in physical danger and was attempting to defend himself.\u201d He further found that \u201c [i]n retrospect, it appears likely that Mr. Harrison used excessive force\u201d in striking Frank with the pole.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> On the basis of these findings, the judge concluded that there was no just cause to evict Harrison because the parties had had a long and harmonious relationship but for this \u201cisolated incident\u201d which was partly Frank\u2019s fault and because a recurrence was improbable.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">The sole question presented on these facts is whether Harrison\u2019s use of excessive force in defending himself against Frank constitutes just cause for his eviction under \u00a7 9(a) (10). Driscoll contends that just cause must be construed broadly to include any reason advanced by a landlord in good faith to protect an economic or property interest, so long as it does not conflict with the purposes of the rent control legis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>lation.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Compare <em>Gentile </em>v. <em>Rent Control Bd. of Somerville, </em>365 Mass. at 343, and <em>Zussman </em>v. <em>Rent Control Bd. of Brookline, </em>367 Mass. 561 (1975), with <em>Mayo </em>v. <em>Boston Rent Control Admr., </em>365 Mass. 575 (1974). Harrison argues that the legislative purposes of rent control will be frustrated unless the reasons for which a landlord can evict a tenant are strictly limited, and, thus, just cause cannot be interpreted to permit an eviction for the conduct which was found not to rise to the level of a nuisance under \u00a7 9(a)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">Even if we accept the tenant\u2019s argument that an isolated incident of misconduct cannot be a basis for an eviction under \u00a7 9(a)(3), we nevertheless can scrutinize the tenant\u2019s conduct under \u00a7 9(a) (10). A contention to the contrary was rejected in <em>Gentile </em>v. <em>Rent Control Bd. of Somerville, </em>365 Mass. at 347: \u201cAccepting the plaintiff\u2019s contention that the late payment of rent is not included within the language of subsection (1), a point which we need not decide, we see no conflict in including within the \u2018other just cause[s]\u2019 of subsection (10) chronic late payment of rent, a situation which could be substantially more adverse to the landlord\u2019s interest than nonpayment of a single rental obligation.\u201d Further, those cases which the tenant cites in support of his contention that a tenant cannot be evicted under \u00a7 9(a) (10) for a single episode of misconduct are inapposite. Evictions in those cases were sought on the grounds of nuisance pursuant to statutes and regulations making no provisions for just cause or a comparable basis. See <em>Sam Priceman Constr. Co. </em>v. <em>Goldstein, </em>183 Misc. 171 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. 1944);<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number><em>DiLella </em>v. <em>O\u2019Brien, </em>187 Misc. 922 (N.Y. City Court of Albany, 1946). See also 65 McKinney\u2019s Unconsol. Laws \u00a7 8585 (1) (a) through (f) inclusive; New York City Rent And Rehabilitation Law, 451-6.0(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">While the words \u201cjust cause,\u201d \u201cgood cause\u201d or \u201cdue cause\u201d take on different colorations when viewed in the context of the nature of the proceeding in which they are invoked as a basis for terminating a legal relationship, they have long been understood to mean \u201cany ground which is put forward ... in good faith, and which is not arbitrary, irrational, unreasonable, or irrelevant.\u201d <em>Davis </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Somerville, </em>307 Mass. 354, 362 (1940). See also <em>Amoco Oil Co. </em>v. <em>Dickson, </em>378 Mass. 44, 47-48 (1979), for a collection of cases defining \u201cjust cause,\u201d \u201cdue cause,\u201d and \u201cgood cause.\u201d This standard is employed also in public housing eviction proceedings.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> As used in \u00a7 9(a)(10), \u201cjust cause\u201d has its usual and plain common sense meaning. Thus, while recurrent misconduct may constitute just cause, so too may an isolated incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">The facts that the episode was an isolated one, that it was caused in part by Frank, and that it is unlikely to recur, do not diminish the tenant\u2019s misconduct: he used excessive force and committed a serious act of violence.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> A landlord\u2019s wish to remove a tenant who acted in such a manner against his son and employee while in the performance of his duties <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>related to the property is neither arbitrary and capricious nor irrelevant. Additionally, there is no evidence to suggest that Driscoll acted in bad faith or for a reason in conflict with the purpose of the Rent Control Act in seeking Harrison\u2019s eviction. While the eviction will result in the decontrol of Harrison\u2019s unit, Driscoll\u2019s uncontradicted testimony shows that he was not motivated by this fact to commence eviction proceedings. Driscoll receives two hundred twenty dollars a month for each of the four controlled units; the rentals on the remaining twelve apartments range from two hundred thirty-five dollars to two hundred seventy-five dollars a month. In his twenty-three years as a landlord, Driscoll has initiated only three eviction actions, including the present case, which is his first eviction resulting in decontrol of the unit vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">Although Harrison has been beyond reproach as a tenant for many years with this one grave exception, rent control legislation does not vest him with a right to engage in more than one serious incident of misconduct before he can be evicted. Driscoll has acted with just cause and for a purpose not in conflict with the Rent Control Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">The judgments are reversed and the matters are remanded to the Boston Division of the Housing Court Department for the entry of a judgment in Driscoll\u2019s favor on his summary process complaint and for the entry of a judgment affirming the decision of the rent board of Boston on Harrison\u2019s appeal therefrom.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b468-14\">As St. 1970, c. 842, \u00a7 9(a), and c. 3, tit. 10, \u00a7 108(a) of the Ordinances of the City of Boston, are substantially identical in language, our reference to the former will constitute also a reference to the latter throughout this opinion.

Harrison described his blow with the pole as of such range and force that \u201cif [Frank] had dodged the blow he probably would have got hit on the head and the blow would have killed him. \u201d Frank received medical treatment and missed four days of work due to the soreness in his arm. The force used by Harrison to protect himself against Frank\u2019s light pushing with his finger was clearly excessive.
