L. c. 212, \u00a7 30) dismissing an action brought under G. L. c. 150A, \u00a7 6(e), by the Massachusetts Labor Relations Commission (commission) to enforce its order requiring, among other things, that the defendant company (Blue Hill) offer reinstatement to two employees, John Clegg and John Russell, the interveners. The commission found that Blue Hill had discharged them on October 31, 1974, for union activity and had thus engaged in unfair labor practices, as defined in G. L. c. 150A, \u00a7\u00a7 4(1) and 4(3). Blue Hill filed a motion to dismiss on the ground that the \u201c[pjlaintiff\u2019s Decision and Order ... is null and void\u201d because it dealt with matters \u201csubject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the National Labor Relations Board\u201d and because Blue Hill was not properly notified of the formal hearing on which the decision and order were based. The defendant also filed an answer to the commission\u2019s complaint in this enforcement action, alleging, in addition to the matters in the motion to dismiss, that the decision and order were not supported by substantial evidence. The court dismissed the action on the first ground in Blue Hill\u2019s motion to dismiss \u2014 that Federal preemption<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> precluded enforcement of the commission\u2019s order. It therefore did not reach Blue Hill\u2019s other contentions. Since we hold that the doctrine of Federal preemption as applied to the circumstances of this case does not vitiate the commission\u2019s order, we discuss all three of the defendant\u2019s contentions. We reverse the judgment below and order that judgment enter enforcing the commission\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-8\">1. <em>Federal preemption. </em>On November 4, 1974, the Monday following the discharge of Clegg and Russell on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>Thursday, October 31, 1974, the Teamsters Union, Local 841, on behalf of which they had been organizing, filed an unfair labor practice charge with the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB). On March 18, 1975, the NLRB issued a complaint alleging, among other things, that Clegg and Russell had been discharged for their union activities in violation of \u00a7 8(a)(3) of the National Labor Relations Act. 29U.S.C. \u00a7 158(a)(3) (1970). The NLRB scheduled a hearing on the allegations of the complaint for May 1, 1975. Thereafter, by telegram dated April 29, 1975, the NLRB postponed its hearing indefinitely. Just prior thereto, on April 24, 1975, Clegg and Russell filed charges with the commission, alleging that their discharges on October 31, 1974, were unfair labor practices under G. L. c. 150A, \u00a7\u00a7 4(1) and 4(3). On December 19, 1975, the commission issued a complaint alleging that Blue Hill had discharged Clegg and Russell because of their union activities and scheduled a hearing for January 12, 1976. The hearing was held as scheduled; no one from Blue Hill attended the hearing. On January 30, 1976, the NLRB dismissed its complaint. On April 2, 1976, the commission issued the decision and order which it now seeks to enforce.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">The court below, in its memorandum refusing to enforce the order, ruled that \u201cpreemption remains unless and until the National Labor Relations Board . . . declines to exercise its jurisdiction\u201d and that the commission \u201ctook significant action while the matter was pending before [the] NLRB.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>Thus Blue Hill in its brief correctly characterizes \u201cthe decision below [as] demonstrating] that the question turn[ed] on the legal impact of the outstanding NLRB complaint.\u201d The court and the defendant have regarded as irrelevant the fact that the commission\u2019s order was issued after the dismissal of the complaint, which, the parties conceded at oral argument, was the equivalent of a declination of jurisdiction. See 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 164(c) (1970); G. L. c. 150A, \u00a7 10(h).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Since the order came after the declination of jurisdiction, Blue Hill is left with the argument \u2014- not that the issuance of the order is preempted by the Federal labor statutes \u2014 but that it has no basis because, as put in its brief, \u201call action taken by the [commission while the NLRB complaint was outstanding is a nullity and there is no effective hearing to support its decision.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">The issue is a narrow one. It does not involve the question whether a State court should grant relief to a party to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>commission proceeding within the primary jurisdiction of the NLRB<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> where the party seeks to forestall a determination by the commission. See e.g., <em>Hathaway Bakeries, Inc. </em>v. <em>Labor Relations Commn., </em>316 Mass. 136 (1944). A request to a court to interfere in the commission\u2019s administrative process in order to vindicate the primary jurisdiction of the NLRB may occur at various stages of commission proceedings and raises difficult questions of what, if anything, is required at any particular stage to protect the NLRB\u2019s primary jurisdiction \u2014 questions which we need not answer in this case. Nor need we attempt to evaluate the administrative accommodation generally made by the commission to the NLRB\u2019s preemptive power. Compare the accommodation made by the Connecticut State Labor Relations Board as described by Professor Fleming James, while its chairman. James, State Against Federal Jurisdiction in Labor Relations, 31 Conn. B.J. 5, 9-11 (1957).</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">Here the Superior Court and we are asked to vindicate a primary jurisdiction which the NLRB\u2019s declination has in effect destroyed. It was plain at the time that the Superior Court received this case that the \u201crisk of interference with the unfair labor practice jurisdiction of the Board\u201d <em>(Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., </em>436 U.S. at 197) had been dissipated. Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Noffke, </em>376 Mass. 127, 133-134 (1978). Whether the NLRB (see <em>NLRB </em>v. <em>Nash-Finch Co., </em>404 U.S. 138, 145-147 [1971]; <em>NLRB </em>v. <em>Committee of In</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number><em>terns &amp; Residents, </em>566 F.2d 810, 812-813 [2d Cir. 1977], cert. denied, 435 U.S. 904 [1978]) or Blue Hill (see <em>Hathaway Bakeries, Inc. </em>v. <em>Labor Relations Commn., </em>316 Mass. 136 [1944]) might have stopped the State hearing before the declination is beside the point. Neither attempted \u2014 and indeed Blue Hill made no attempt even upon receipt of the commission\u2019s decision (it was mailed to Blue Hill on April 2, 1976) \u2014 to petition for rehearing as permitted by G. L. c. 150A, \u00a7 <em>6if), </em>or move for reconsideration as permitted by 402 Code Mass. Regs. 2.03(13) (1978). See <em>Norway Cafe, Inc. </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Beverages Control Commn., </em>7 Mass. App. Ct. 37, 39-40 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">In the circumstances, we do not shut our eyes to the reality that there was, indeed, a hearing. Thus in <em>Incres S.S. Co. </em>v. <em>International Maritime Wkrs. Union, </em>10 N.Y.2d 218 (1961), vacated, 372 U.S. 24 (1963), the New York Court of Appeals reversed the grant of an injunction against picketing a foreign vessel on the ground that the dispute was \u201carguably\u201d within the jurisdiction of the NLRB. The United States Supreme Court reversed the New York Court of Appeals on the ground that \u201calthough it was arguable that the Board\u2019s jurisdiction extended to this dispute at the time of the New York Court of Appeals\u2019 decision, our decision in <em>[McCulloch </em>v.] <em>Sociedad Nacional [de Marineros de Honduras, </em>372 U.S. 10 (1963), a case holding that the NLRB did not have jurisdiction over seamen on foreign vessels] clearly negates such jurisdiction now.\u201d <em>Incres S.S. Co. </em>v. <em>International Maritime Wkrs. Union, </em>372 U.S. 24, 27 (1963). The case was remanded to the Court of Appeals \u201cfor further proceedings consistent with this opinion . . . .\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 28. Although the opinions of both the United States Supreme Court and the New York Court of Appeals indicated that the hearing on the injunction and the issuance of the order which resulted were preempted at the time they took place, the Court of Appeals reinstated the lower court order; it did not treat the order and the hearing on which it was based as \u201cvoid.\u201d <em>Incres S.S. Co. </em>v. <em>International Maritime Wkrs. Union, </em>13 N.Y.2d 754 (1963). As this court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>said in <em>Goes </em>v. <em>Feldman, </em>8 Mass. App. Ct. 84, 90-91 (1979), answering an analogous argument that a statute could not operate to validate actions taken before its passage because the defect was \u201cjurisdictional\u201d: \u2014 \u201c[I]t seems dogmatic and formalistic to insist that where jurisdiction is absent at the inception of litigation, it cannot subsequently be conferred because the litigation was a nullity <em>ab initio.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">We see no need for so sweeping a prophylactic rule in order to assure the integrity of the NLRB\u2019s primary jurisdiction. The impact on Federal labor policy from the mere holding of a commission hearing may be met, where it should be met at all,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> by an action before the hearing to prevent a possible determination by the commission in a matter preempted by the Federal labor laws. <em>Hathaway Bakeries, Inc. </em>v. <em>Labor Relations Commn., </em>316 Mass. at 143. <em>NLRB </em>v. <em>Nash-Finch Co., </em>404 U.S. 138 (1971). Such a rule would be particularly inappropriate in this case, in which the hearing was held after the NLRB had postponed indefinitely any hearing on its complaint and within two weeks of the commission hearing had declined jurisdiction. Nor do we see any justification for providing relief from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>hearing to Blue Hill at this late date. Apart from the issue of notice, to be discussed, Blue Hill does not claim prejudice to itself because the hearing was held prior to the NLRB declination and it did not, so far as appears, petition for rehearing (G. L. c. 150A, \u00a7 <em>6[f]) </em>or move for reconsideration (402 Code Mass. Regs. 2.03[13] [1978]). Nor did it ask the Superior Court for \u201cleave to adduce additional evidence\u201d before the commission. G. L. c. 150A, \u00a7 6(e). Cf. <em>Norway Cafe, Inc. </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Beverages Control Commn., </em>7 Mass. App. Ct. at 39-40.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">2. <em>Notice. </em>Blue Hill argues, on the basis of the \u201cStipulation of Facts\u201d (see n.3),<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> that, even if the hearing is otherwise viable, the commission did not give Blue Hill notice of the hearing which complied with statutory or constitutional requirements. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">The provision for notice is found in G. L. c. 150A, \u00a7 7(4), inserted by St. 1938, c. 345, \u00a7 2, and is set out in the margin.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> It is clear from the \u201cStipulation of Facts,\u201d and is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>not disputed, that the complaint and notice of hearing were sent by certified mail, return receipt requested, addressed to the defendant at 46 Granite Street, Boston, Blue Hill\u2019s principal place of business.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> It was signed for on behalf of Blue Hill by an \u201coffice clerical\u201d employed by Blue Hill.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">We see nothing, and Blue Hill points to nothing, in the language of \u00a7 7(4) contrary to the procedure for notice used by the commission. Service by certified mail met the requirements in the statute for service by registered mail (G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7, Forty-fourth), and service on the corporation properly named was service on the \u201cperson required to be served.\u201d G. L. c. 150A, \u00a7 2(1), inserted by St. 1938, c. 345, \u00a7 2 (\u201cThe term \u2018person\u2019 includes . . . corporations . . . .\u201d). See G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7, Twenty-third.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">Nor is there any basis for Blue Hill\u2019s argument that the commission must make service on the corporation in accordance with the provision for service in a civil action under G. L. c. 223, \u00a7 37 (second par.).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b82-7\">The provisions of G. L. c. 150A, \u00a7 7(4), are sufficiently detailed so that the commission, in administering those provisions, was not obliged to go beyond them. Compare <em>Director of the Div. of Water Pollution Control </em>v. <em>Uxbridge, </em>361 Mass. 589, 591-592 (1972). Nor can we say that the commission exceeded its administrative discretion in not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>importing the provisions of G. L. c. 223, \u00a7 37, into the notice procedure. Section 7(4) does not refer to that procedure \u2014 some indication of an intent to absolve the commission from the more onerous provisions for the commencement of civil actions. Compare G. L. c. 176D, \u00a7 6, inserted by St. 1972, c. 543, \u00a7 1, which provides for service \u201ceither in the manner provided by law for service of process in civil actions, or by registering and mailing a copy thereof to the person affected by such . . . process at his or <em>its </em>residence or principal office or place of business\u201d (emphasis supplied) \u2014 indicating that both notice under G. L. c. 223, \u00a7 37, and notice by certified mail to \u201cits . . . principal office or place of business\u201d are reasonable. <em>James </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins., </em>10 Mass. App. Ct. 883, 883-884 (1980). Further, the commission could assume that a corporation would provide a procedure for funneling mail to an appropriate officer. <em>Nelson </em>v. <em>City of New York, </em>352 U.S. 103, 107-108 (1956). If that procedure broke down, it was the responsibility of the corporation. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Crosscup, </em>369 Mass. 228, 239 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">Nor are we impressed with Blue Hill\u2019s argument that notice of the hearing should have been addressed to a Madeline Whiting rather than to the corporation because she had replied to the original notice of the charge with respect to Clegg under the designation \u201cgeneral manager.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> We see no such requirement either in law or in reason. The commission was not required to assume that Whiting would remain as general manager of the corporation; it was not required to keep itself informed of the goings and comings of Blue Hill\u2019s personnel. (The notice of the hearing was sent about seven months after the date of the letter from Whiting.)</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">Blue Hill\u2019s argument that it did not receive notice and, therefore, the commission\u2019s order if enforced would deprive it of due process of law has no basis in fact or in law. The burden to show a constitutional deprivation is, of course, on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>Blue Hill. The portion of the \u201cStipulation of Facts\u201d set out in the margin on which the contention is based<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> is hardly equivalent to proof that either she or some other appropriate officer did not receive actual notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">Nor does it help Blue Hill if we were to assume that neither Whiting nor any other appropriate officer of the corporation received actual <em>notice. </em>The failure to receive actual notice does not amount to a constitutional deprivation if the method of notice is \u201creasonably calculated, under all the circumstances, to apprise interested parties of the pendency of the action and afford them an opportunity to present their objections .... \u2018The criterion is not the possibility of conceivable injury but the just and reasonable character of the requirements, having reference to the subject with which the statute deals.\u2019\u201d <em>Mullane v. Central Hanover Bank &amp; Trust Co., </em>339 U.S. 306, 314-315 (1950) (citation omitted). The method of notice used in this case was in compliance with the statute and \u201cmay be presumed reasonable.\u201d <em>Save the Bay, Inc. v. Department of Pub. Util., </em>366 Mass. 667, 677 (1975). As we have indicated above, we are not persuaded that the presumption has been rebutted.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">Further, the fairness of the notice procedure used by the commission finds support in the provision of G. L. c. 150A, \u00a7 <em>6(f), </em>permitting \u201ca petition for rehearing,\u201d 402 Code Mass. Regs. 2.03(13) (1978), providing for \u201cmotions made . . . subsequent to the hearing,\u201d and G. L. c. 150A, \u00a7 6(e), providing that either party in an enforcement proceeding may \u201capply to the court for leave to adduce additional evidence\u201d before the <em>commission. </em>Compare Mass. R. Civ. P. 60(b), 365 Mass. 828-829 (1974); <em>Ellington v. Milne, </em>14 F.R.D. 241 (E.D. N.C. 1953). Blue Hill, as we have indicated above, has not attempted to use any of these oppor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>tunities. We see no \u201cfundamental unfairness.\u201d <em>B.F. Goodrich Co. </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Security, </em>6 Mass. App. Ct. 784, 801 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">3. <em>Discriminatory discharges. </em>Clegg<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and Russell were truck-drivers for Blue Hill; they distributed drinking water in five-gallon bottles to various businesses in the greater Boston area. Blue Hill employed about twenty persons, of whom about twelve were truck drivers who distributed the bottled water. About the middle of August, 1974, Clegg was assigned to make deliveries to the office of Teamsters Local 841 in Malden. There he became acquainted with the union personnel and undertook to unionize Blue Hill. In this he worked together with Russell; they were friends. They originally attempted to organize the entire plant but later, in September, limited themselves to the truck drivers. All but two or three of the drivers signed cards authorizing Teamsters Local 841 to represent them. All this was done on the Blue Hill premises, but secretly, \u2022 since there were rumors that others had been fired previously for union activity. , The signed authorization cards were sent to Local 841; and on October 31, 1974, Fitzgerald, as secretary-treasurer of Local 841, sent a mailgram to Blue Hill \u201cAttn Mrs. M. Whiting,\u201d claiming that the local represented the majority of Blue Hill\u2019s employees and requesting a meeting. It was correctly addressed and carried the abbreviation, \u201cDLR IMMY,\u201d which we take to mean, \u201cdeliver immediately.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The mailgram was sent at 1:04 p.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">When Clegg returned from his route that day at about 5:15 p.m., Whiting was waiting for him with an envelope. She appeared angry. When Clegg greeted her she replied, \u201cHere\u2019s your paycheck, you are fired.\u201d He asked her, \u201cWhat\u2019s this for\u201d; she answered, \u201cYou know what\u2019s this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>for.\u201d He said, \u201cOkay, Mrs. Whiting.\u201d She then said, \u201cI hope I will never see you again.\u201d He replied, \u201cYou will . . . hear from me again .... You will be hearing from my union, Mrs. Whiting,\u201d and walked out. Outside he saw Russell, who told Clegg that he had also.been fired and showed him his paycheck. This occurred on a Thursday, though the work week ended on Friday.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">Taken together, the circumstances point clearly to discriminatory discharges of the only two employees engaged in organizing the truck drivers since September.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> That very day a telegram was sent by Local 841,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> the particular union local with which Mrs. Whiting knew Clegg had contact as a driver. The precipitate discharges before the end of the work week<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> indicate a desire that they leave immediately and have no further contact with the employees. \u201cThe abruptness of a discharge and its timing are persuasive evidence as to its motivation . . . .\u201d <em>NLRB </em>v. <em>Montgomery Ward &amp; Co., </em>242 F.2d 497, 502 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 355 U.S. 829 (1957). Whiting\u2019s refusal to give an explanation, which \u201cmay itself be a reason for inferring a discriminatory discharge,\u201d <em>A.J. Krajewski Mfg. Co. </em>v. <em>NLRB, </em>413 F.2d 673, 676 n.2 (1st Cir. 1969),<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> leaves antiunion animus as the only plausible explanation. And as we have seen, Blue Hill has never sought an opportunity to explain the dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>charges.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The angry and abrupt discharge seems to indicate animus beyond displeasure with a poor performer. <em>Joseph West, </em>244 N.L.R.B. 828, 830-833 (1979).<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Whiting\u2019s hostility is further shown by her subsequent refusal to speak to union representatives when they called her on the telephone.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">We need not attempt to separate knowledge from motive. <em>A.J.

In the circumstances and in the view we take of this case, the commission has no further fact finding role, and we deem it appropriate to decide the legal question posed by the Superior Court\u2019s decision without remand to the commission. <em>Saint Luke\u2019s Hosp. </em>v. <em>Labor Relations Commn., </em>320 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>Mass. 467, 470-471 (1946).

L. c. 150A, \u00a7 6(e), as appearing in St. 1973, c. 1114, \u00a7 15, that \u201cno objection that has not been urged before the commission . . . shall be considered by the court, unless the failure or neglect to urge such objections shall be excused because of extraordinary circumstances.\u201d But the record before us does not indicate that this provision was in any way urged before the Superior Court in connection with the specific issue on which that court decided the case, and the \u201cStipulation of Facts\u201d looks to the contrary.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b77-9\"> The parties in this case chose to go behind the bare dismissal, which the \u201cStipulation of Facts\u201d indicates was grounded on the conclusion by a field attorney of the NLRB \u201cafter further review and additional consideration of the financial data . . . that the [bjoard should not exercise jurisdiction over Blue Hill Spring Water Company.\u201d The defendant in its brief points to this evidence for its contention that \u201cthe NLRB determined that it did have jurisdiction and then subsequently determined that it should not exercise it\u201d (emphasis omitted). In the absence of a more official statement of the NLRB\u2019s reasons for dismissing the charges (see <em>Hanna Mining Co. </em>v. <em>District 2, Marine Engrs. Beneficial Assn., </em>382 U.S. 181, 190 [1965]; <em>Pennsylvania Labor Relations Bd. </em>v. <em>Butz, </em>411 Pa. 360, 369-372 [1963]), we proceed on the basis accepted by the parties that there was'a declination of jurisdiction in this case sufficient to give the commission power to proceed after January 30, 1976. G. L. c. 150A, \u00a7 10(h).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b78-6\">The phrase \u201cprimary jurisdiction of the NLRB\u201d is explicated in <em>Lodge 76, Intl. Assn. of Machinists </em>v. <em>Wisconsin Employment Relations Commn., </em>427 U.S. 132, 138-139 (1976) (quoting from <em>Motor Coach Employees </em>v. <em>Lockridge, </em>403 U.S. 274, 290-291 [1971], and <em>San Diego Bldg. Trades Council </em>v. <em>Garmon, </em>359 U.S. 236, 244 [1959]), in which the United States Supreme Court said: \u201cWhen it is clear or may fairly be assumed that the activities which a State purports to regulate are protected by \u00a7 7 of the National Labor Relations Act, or constitute an unfair labor practice under \u00a7 8, due regard for the federal enactment requires that state jurisdiction must yield. To leave the States free to regulate conduct so plainly within the central aim of federal regulation involves too great a danger of conflict between power asserted by Congress and requirements imposed by state law.\u201d See <em>Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>San Diego County Dist.

Corp. </em>v. <em>Wisconsin Employment Relations Bd., </em>336 U.S. 18, 25-26 (1949)(State certification \u201cfreezes into a pattern that which the federal act has left fluid\u201d). <em>NLRB </em>v. <em>Committee of Interns &amp; Residents, </em>566 F.2d at 816 (State certification might lead to \u201ccontradictory duties and obligations\u201d). <em>Pan American World Airways, Inc. v.

L. c. 150A, \u00a7 10(h), separately. We agree with Blue Hill, as set out in its brief, that the statute embodies \u201cprinciples of preemption which the Massachusetts Legislature has specifically adopted.\u201d See <em>Wheaton College </em>v. <em>Labor Relations Commn., </em>352 Mass. 731, 734 (1967), and <em>American Natl. Red Cross </em>v. <em>Labor Relations Commn., </em>363 Mass. 525, 527 (1973), both indicating the correlation between the board\u2019s declination of jurisdiction over a labor dispute (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 164[c][1] [1976]) and the commission\u2019s consequent power to adjudicate the labor dispute. The legislative history of the model for \u00a7 10(b), Conn. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 31-101(7), indicates an intent to do no more than extend State power to all cases not federally preempted. See First Report of Connecticut Labor Relations Board, 19 L.R.R.M. 91, 91 (1947).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b81-8\">Both parties regard the \u201cStipulation of Facts\u201d as a proper basis for decision on the question of notice by this court, as it would have been by the Superior Court had it reached the issue.
