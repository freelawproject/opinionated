Plaintiff later amended his complaint to include the claims of four additional named Plaintiffs. (Dkt. No. 68.) The Court denied SolarCity's motion to compel arbitration given the Ninth Circuit's decision in\n   <em>\n    Morris v.

Having reviewed the parties' original and supplemental briefs, and having had the benefit of oral argument on August 9, 2018, the Court DENIES the motion to compel arbitration of Plaintiffs Whitworth, Carranza, and Frias's PAGA claims, but GRANTS the motion to compel arbitration of their individual claims and GRANTS the motion to compel as to Plaintiffs Farrohki and Whitford's individual claims. The Court also GRANTS SolarCity's motion to stay proceedings pending arbitration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Following the Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Epic\n   </em>\n   , the Court held a Status Conference to discuss how to proceed in this action. (Dkt. No. 114.) As a threshold matter, the parties agree that three of the five Plaintiffs-Whitworth, Carranza, and Frias-have valid arbitration agreements and that these agreements contain representative action waivers which preclude them from pursuing representative actions. The parties also agree that Plaintiffs Whitworth, Carranza, and Frias cannot bring class claims and that their individual non-PAGA claims must be arbitrated. The parties cannot agree, however, about whether\n   Plaintiffs Farrohki and Whitford have valid arbitration agreements or how the Court should handle Plaintiffs Whitworth, Carranza, and Frias's PAGA claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Court thus directed the parties to provide supplemental briefing regarding three issues. (Dkt. No. 116.) First, whether\n   <em>\n    Epic\n   </em>\n   overruled\n   <em>\n    Sakkab v. Luxottica Retail N.

Second, to address SolarCity's argument that the Court must compel Plaintiffs to arbitrate their PAGA claims first.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Finally, whether the Court must compel Plaintiffs Farrohki and Whitford to arbitrate their individual claims. Subsumed within this question are whether the arbitration agreements are invalid because they include non-severable waivers of representative actions including PAGA claims, and the question of whether Farrohki and Whitford have standing to challenge the validity of their arbitration agreements on this ground given that they have not pled PAGA claims. Upon review of the original motion to compel briefing, as well as the parties' supplemental submissions, and having had the benefit of oral argument, the Court rules as follows.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

As\n   <em>\n    Sakkab\n   </em>\n   explained, \"[a]n agreement to waive 'representative' PAGA claims-that is, claims for penalties arising out of violations against other employees-is effectively an agreement to limit the penalties an employee-plaintiff may recover on behalf of the state.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=327%20P.3d%20129\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 436 (\"PAGA action is a statutory action for penalties brought as a proxy for the state, rather than a procedure for resolving the claims of other employees.\").\n   <em>\n    Epic\n   </em>\n   does not require an interpretation of the FAA that allows a private party to immunize itself from liability under a particular law, especially a law prosecuted on behalf of a state.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In sum,\n   <em>\n    Sakkab\n   </em>\n   is not clearly irreconcilable with\n   <em>\n    Epic\n   </em>\n   ; rather, there remains a \"meaningful basis for the [\n   <em>\n    Sakkab\n   </em>\n   ] rule.\"\n   <em>\n    Morton v.

Section 558 assesses a penalty of $50 for each initial violation and $100 for each subsequent violation in a pay period in addition to \"an amount sufficient to recover underpaid wages.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%20558\">\n    Cal.

It was unlikely that \"the predominate amounts recovered under\n   section 558 w[ould] be in the form of underpaid wages payable to employees\" because \"depending upon how many violations occurred during a pay period and the effected employees' rate of pay, it [wa]s quite possible that, at least as to the rest break and meal break allegations, the underpaid wage portion of any recovery w[ould] fall within the 25 percent range implicitly approved by the court in\n   <em>\n    Iskanian\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    Lawson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12514123\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-rptr-3d/227/613/\">\n    18 Cal.

In other words, the $50 to $100 penalty per violation in a pay period would exceed any unpaid wage recovery and ensure that the majority of the recovery goes to the state as opposed to an individual.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Moreover, while both\n   <em>\n    Esparaza\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Lawson\n   </em>\n   assume without analysis that in a PAGA action the unpaid wages portion of the section 558(a) civil penalty will go entirely to the aggrieved employees, this Court is not so certain. The PAGA was enacted\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   section 558, and provides that 75 percent of the civil penalties recovered by an aggrieved employee are allocated to the state. If the entire section 558 recovery is considered the penalty, including the unpaid wages portion, then pursuant to a PAGA claim 75 percent of that penalty, including 75 percent of the unpaid wages, are allocated to the state. To put it another way, when the State enforces section 558, the $50 or $100 per violation portion of the penalty goes to the state, and all of the unpaid wages portion goes to the aggrieved employees. On the other hand, when an employee brings a PAGA claim based on a section 558 violation, 75 percent of the penalty goes to the state and 25 percent to the employee, including 25 percent of the portion that in a state-enforcement action would go entirely to the state.

In response to the motion to compel, Plaintiffs Farrohki and Whitford argued that their arbitration agreements are invalid due to the presence of an unlawful PAGA waiver. The Court declined to reach this issue because it denied the motion to compel arbitration based on\n   <em>\n    Morris\n   </em>\n   . In doing so, the Court suggested that it also had concerns regarding Farrohki and Whitford's standing to raise this challenge since they have not pled PAGA claims.

There is no dispute that they each signed employment agreements that require them to arbitrate their individual claims. (Dkt. No. 71-5 at 12, 37.) The arbitration agreements also waive their ability to bring the claims on behalf of a putative class or through a collective action. In particular, the waiver language of their arbitration agreements states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   \"In arbitration, the parties will have the right to conduct civil discovery, bring motions, and present witnesses and evidence as provided by the forum state's procedural rules applicable to court litigation as interpreted and applied by the arbitrator.\n   <strong>\n    However, there will be no right or authority for any dispute to be brought, heard or arbitrated as a class or collective action (\"Class Action Waiver\"), or in a representative or private attorney general capacity on behalf of a class of persons or the general public.\n   </strong>\n   Notwithstanding any other clause contained in this Agreement, the preceding sentence shall not be severable from this Agreement in any case in which the dispute to be arbitrated is brought as a class or collective action, or in a representative or private attorney general capacity on behalf of a class of persons or the general public.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   (Dkt.

The issue actually litigated and necessarily decided was whether the invalid PAGA waiver was not severable and therefore the arbitration agreement in its entirety unenforceable when the plaintiff brings a PAGA claim; these cases did not address whether the invalid PAGA waiver is not severable under these agreements when the plaintiff does\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   bring a PAGA claim.

After the courts determined that the arbitration agreements included an unenforceable PAGA waiver, they went on to analyze\n   whether the waiver was severable. They held the waiver was not severable because the plain language of the non-severability clause applied; namely, the PAGA waiver was not severable because the plaintiffs sought to bring their actions as private attorney generals.\n   <em>\n    Wan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%2025497\">\n    2017 WL 25497\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *10-11 ;\n   <em>\n    Altman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%202892733\">\n    2016 WL 2892733\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4. If, as Plaintiffs contend, the agreements were void from the beginning solely because of the presence of the PAGA waiver, there was no need for the courts to analyze whether the PAGA waiver was severable. It is thus unsurprising that Plaintiffs do not cite any case that holds an entire arbitration agreement is void\n   <em>\n    ab initio\n   </em>\n   merely because it includes a PAGA waiver. Thus, issue preclusion does not compel this Court to hold that Farrohki and Whitford's arbitration agreements are void and unenforceable in their entirety.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <strong>\n    2. The Invalid PAGA Waiver is Severable\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Having concluded that issue preclusion does not require a finding of unenforceability, the Court must still address the effect of the presence of the invalid PAGA waiver. The Court previously raised a concern as to whether Farrohki and Whitford have standing to challenge the enforceability of the arbitration agreement based on the invalid PAGA waiver given that they do not bring PAGA claims. And indeed, in similar circumstances, some courts have held that they do not.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gerton v.

Further, the single invalid provision-the PAGA waiver-has no applicability to Farrohki and Whitford's case given that they do not bring any PAGA claims. Thus, the PAGA waiver\n   should be severed and the remainder of the agreement enforced.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Farrohki and Whitford nonetheless appear to assert that the Court cannot sever the PAGA waiver under the plain language of the arbitration agreements. In particular, because the agreements state that the class, collective and PAGA waiver \"shall not be severable from this Agreement in any case in which the dispute to be arbitrated is brought as a class or collective action, or in a representative or private attorney general capacity on behalf of a class of persons or the general public,\" and Farrohki and Whitford bring their wage and hour claims as a class and collective action, the PAGA claims are not severable.

It makes no sense to read the arbitration agreements as precluding the severability of the PAGA waiver because, in violation of their arbitration agreements, Farrohki and Whitford nonetheless filed suit in federal court and asserted claims on behalf of a class. To put it another way, the PAGA waiver is severable if no PAGA claim is brought.
