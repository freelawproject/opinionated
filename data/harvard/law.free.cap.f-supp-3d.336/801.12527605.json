Roberts, United States District Judge\n   <strong>\n    I. INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   In this ballot access case, Christopher Graveline (\"Graveline\") and three of his supporters (\"Plaintiff-Voters\"; collectively \"Plaintiffs\") challenge three Michigan statutes which they say operate in combination to deprive them of substantial associational and equal protection rights under the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   First, Plaintiffs say these statutes severely burden Graveline's right to appear on the November general election ballot as an independent, non-partisan candidate for attorney general. Second, they say that because of Graveline's exclusion from the ballot, the Plaintiff-Voters are unable to \"cast a meaningful and effective vote\"; they only have major party candidates to choose from, but they believe that Michigan's attorney general should be a non-partisan actor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiffs contend that Michigan's statutory scheme functions as an absolute bar to independent candidates for statewide office (i.e., the offices of governor, lieutenant governor, attorney general, and secretary of state) seeking access to the general election ballot. Additionally, they say that their freedom to associate for the advancement of their ideas and beliefs is hampered by the monopolization of the attorney general ballot by party candidates.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Defendants fail to address the combined burdens and collective impact argument made by Plaintiffs. They also fail to address Plaintiffs' argument that Michigan's long history of failing to qualify an independent candidate for statewide office has served to exclude all independent candidates for attorney general from the ballot for thirty years, and that this failure should be considered by the Court as a reliable indicator of the unconstitutionality of Michigan's statutes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Court finds that Plaintiffs meet their burden to show that the character and magnitude of their injuries is significant and that the Michigan statutes - in combination - severely burden the constitutional rights not only of Graveline, but also of the Plaintiff-Voters. On balance, the interests that Defendants seek to protect - guaranteeing that independent candidates have a \"modicum of support\" and protecting the integrity of the election process by regulating the number of candidates on the ballot to avoid voter confusion - are not sufficiently weighty to justify the reach and breadth of the challenged statutes. In addition, it appears that there are less restrictive means by which Defendants can achieve their goals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Accordingly, the Court finds that Plaintiffs show they have a strong likelihood of success on their claims that\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Mich.%20Comp.%20Laws%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20168\">\n    Mich.

Graveline's Campaign Efforts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Graveline filed a Statement of Organization announcing his campaign for Michigan Attorney General on June 4, 2018. As alleged in the complaint, Graveline began collecting signatures on June 7, 2018. Over the next 42 days - up until the July 19, 2018 deadline for submission of his nominating petition - he and 231 volunteers collected 7,899 signatures for submission. Graveline supplemented volunteer efforts by retaining a professional signature-gathering firm, SMI Enterprises. SMI charged $6 per \"billable signature\" and collected over 6,000 signatures for a total expense to his campaign of $37,258. A billable signature is defined as a signature that is collected, processed, and reviewed for any apparent defects; SMI guaranteed that at least 75% of the billable signatures it collected would be valid.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Despite these efforts, Graveline fell well short of the minimum number of required signatures; over the 42 days, his campaign collected 14,157 signatures, with at least 100 signatures in 12 of Michigan's 14 congressional districts, at a cost of approximately $38,000 and with over 1,000 volunteer\n   hours spent. Graveline attempted to file his nominating petition on July 19, 2018, but the Bureau of Elections rejected his filing as incomplete.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Graveline and Plaintiff-Voters - Willard Johnson, Michael Leibson, and Kellie Deming - filed this case on July 27, 2018. Each of the Plaintiff-Voters is a registered Michigan voter who wishes to vote for Graveline as an independent candidate for Attorney General.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Plaintiffs' complaint contains three causes of action; each asserts a violation of First and Fourteenth Amendment rights.

In Count II, Plaintiffs allege that \u00a7 168.590c(2) is unconstitutional as applied in combination with the requirements in \u00a7\u00a7 168.544f and 168.590b(4), because adding the signature requirements to the deadline imposed in \u00a7 168.590c(2) multiplies the undue burden on Plaintiffs, and the requirements are not narrowly tailored to serve a compelling state interest. Count III sets forth the same as applied challenge as Count II, but solely on behalf of Plaintiff-Voters, as a violation of their rights to cast effective votes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The Defendants are Ruth Johnson, in her official capacity as Michigan's Secretary of State, and Sally Williams, in her official capacity as the Director of Michigan's Bureau of Elections (collectively, \"the State\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Plaintiffs seek an order: (1) declaring\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Mich.%20Comp.%20Laws%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20168\">\n    Mich.

They contend that the early filing deadline imposed by \u00a7 168.590c(2) is even more burdensome as applied in conjunction with the high signature requirement imposed by \u00a7 168.544f and the signature distribution requirement in \u00a7 168.590b(4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Plaintiffs say Michigan's 30,000-signature requirement for independent candidates for statewide office is among the most restrictive in the nation; only five states impose higher requirements.
