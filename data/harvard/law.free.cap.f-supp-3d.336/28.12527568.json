Defendants United States of America, Connecticut Department of Labor, and City of Bristol each claim statutory liens in the interpleaded funds. Defendant Chapman Machine Company, Inc., claims it is entitled to some of the interpleaded funds because it, rather than BW Manufacturing, Inc., owned certain machines that plaintiff sold. Plaintiff seeks attorney's fees from the interpleaded fund. For the reasons detailed below, I conclude that the United States of America is entitled to most of the interpleaded funds, that the Connecticut Department of Labor is entitled to some of the funds, and that plaintiff is entitled to an award of limited attorney's fees, but that the City of Bristol and Chapman Industries, Inc., are not entitled to any of the interpleaded funds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The material facts in this case are undisputed unless otherwise indicated. Gary Weed owned two businesses: BW Manufacturing, Inc. (\"BW\") and Chapman Machine Company, Inc. (\"Chapman\"). BW operated out of a warehouse in Bristol, Connecticut. Beginning in 2009, BW became delinquent on its tax obligations. BW failed to pay quarterly employee withholding taxes for the quarterly tax periods ending on June 30, 2009, September 30, 2009, December 31, 2009, March 31, 2010, June 30, 2010, December 31, 2010, March 31, 2011, and June 30, 2011. As a result, the IRS made a number assessments: on September 21, 2009, for $138,343.00; on December 21, 2009, for $120,937.98; on April 5, 2010, for $80,072.79; on June 28, 2010, for $87,126.14; on September 20, 2010, for $59,910.52; on March 28, 2011, for $12,384.25; on June 20, 2011, for $7044.92; and on October 3, 2011, for $5,177.04. Doc. # 140-2 at 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   BW also failed to pay unemployment compensation contributions to the Connecticut Department of Labor (\"DOL\"). As a result, it made a number of assessments and filed liens against BW. First, it filed a lien on August 26, 2010, in the amount of $27,191.51 for the first and second quarters of 2010; on November 24, 2010, in the amount of $25.00 for the third quarter of 2010; on April 12, 2011, in the amount of $558.63 for the fourth quarter of 2010; and on September 28, 2011, in the amount of $7,251.33 for the first and second quarters of 2011 and a special assessment for 2010.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Doc. # 15 at 1-2\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   BW also failed to pay personal property taxes to the City of Bristol (\"City\"). As a result, the City recorded tax liens on the personal property of BW Manufacturing on September 12, 2011, in the amount of $7,850.57, corrected to $15,701.14 plus accrued interest and fees on June 8, 2012; on September 13, 2011, in the amount of $20,852.50; and on February 6, 2012, in the amount of $58,982.50, corrected to $54,571.18 on June 8, 2012. Doc. # 39-2 at 1-3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In early 2012, Gary Weed contacted an auctioneer, plaintiff Thomas Industries, Inc., and proposed that plaintiff auction off some of BW's equipment. Weed acquiesced to a proposal stating that all of the machinery\n   to be auctioned belonged to BW. A little more than a week before the auction, Weed notified plaintiff that not all of the machines were owned by BW and that the proceeds of the auction should be transferred to two different accounts. Doc. # 153 at 11 (\u00b6 35). The auction took place on March 8, 2012, and yielded $729,519.13 in proceeds. After the auction, Weed claimed that nine of the machines were owned by Chapman and not BW. As a result, Chapman claims a right from the auction proceeds to $128,650.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On April 10, 2012, plaintiff filed this interpleader action in state court, naming the City of Bristol, Chapman Machine, Inc., the Connecticut Department of Labor, and the United States of America (\"USA\") as defendants. Doc. # 1-2 at 2. The USA timely and properly removed the action to this Court on May 17, 2012. The City has since filed a cross-claim against all defendants, asserting a claim to some of the funds and asserting a claim to any money recoverable by Chapman. On February 1, 2013, the Court granted an interlocutory judgment of interpleader and ordered plaintiff to deposit $675,805.62 with the Clerk of Court. Doc. # 105.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   An initial round of summary judgment motions were denied in 2013.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docs. # 108-10.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   All parties except Chapman have now filed renewed motions for summary judgment, and plaintiff has also moved for an award of attorney's fees in connection with its fees for filing and litigating this interpleader action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The principles governing the Court's review of a motion for summary judgment are well established. Summary judgment may be granted only if \"the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). I must view the facts in the light most favorable to the party who opposes the motion for summary judgment and then decide if those facts would be enough-if eventually proved at trial-to allow a reasonable jury to decide the case in favor of the opposing party. My role at summary judgment is not to judge the credibility of witnesses or to resolve contested issues of fact but solely to decide if there are enough facts that remain in dispute to warrant a trial.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Tolan v.

The parties' briefs presume that jurisdiction is predicated on the federal interpleader statute,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201335\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1335\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

There is no dispute that there are genuine competing claims to the funds and that plaintiff should be discharged of liability.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The crux of this case is the priority of the competing claims to the fund, which is too small to satisfy all of the lienor defendants' claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Chapman's Claims\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Chapman asserts a claim to the proceeds of nine machines that it alleges it owned prior to the auction. Plaintiff and the USA argue that Chapman is not entitled to the proceeds because it did not own the machines or was merely the alter ego of BW.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Initially, I conclude there is a genuine issue of material fact whether Chapman owned the nine machines that it claimed to own. On the one hand, there is evidence of record that the nine machines at issue were owned by BW. In 2005, BW represented that the nine machines were its property during an appraisal for a loan application. Doc. # 140-10 at 4 (\u00b6 22). The property was physically located at BW's place of business. Doc. # 140-4 at 3 (\u00b6 14). The property appeared in municipal tax declarations submitted by BW. Doc. # 153 at 3. Prior to the auction, Weed represented in an email to plaintiff that all of the equipment to be sold was property of BW, and Weed acquiesced to a proposal by plaintiff that contemplated that all of the equipment was owned by BW.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10. Chapman never filed any personal property tax declarations stating it owned the equipment.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On the other hand, Weed indicated to plaintiff prior to the auction that some of the property did not belong to BW and that the proceeds should go to two separate accounts. Doc. # 140-10 at 2 (\u00b6 9). Moreover, Chapman has submitted an affidavit from Weed stating that the nine machines at issue were owned by Chapman, not BW. Doc. # 152-4 at 1. Before the auction, Weed indicated to a federal revenue officer that some of the property \"belonged to a different company.\" Doc. # 140-4 at 3 (\u00b6 14). Matters of ownership of personal property are generally questions of fact.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pratt v.

And there is enough conflicting\n   evidence in the record to create a genuine issue of material fact whether the nine machines at issue were owned by Chapman.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Nevertheless, the undisputed evidence clearly shows that Chapman was a mere alter ego of BW, regardless whether I apply federal law or state law to determine alter ego status.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Southern New England Tel.

The property allegedly owned by Chapman was intermingled with BW property. Doc. # 140-4 at 3 (\u00b6 14). There was intermingling of funds between the two entities.

Next, the Connecticut Department of Labor enjoys a priority over the USA and the City in its liens recorded on August 26, 2010, for unpaid unemployment compensation contributions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   The next in line for the remainder of the fund is the USA for its September 20, 2010, assessment of unpaid taxes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The City argues that by the terms of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Conn.%20Gen.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2012\">\n    Conn. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 12\n   </extracted-citation>\n   -195b, it enjoys a super-priority over all lienholders or at least the DOL. According to \u00a7 12-195b(b), a perfected municipal tax lien on personal property enjoys \"priority over all previously perfected liens and security interests and other encumbrances of record under the Connecticut Uniform Commercial Code.\" This state statute, of course, does not permit the City to leapfrog the USA's first-in-time priority, because it is federal law and not state law that governs the priority of liens when a federal tax lien is implicated.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Don King Prods., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10522995\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/945/529/#p534\">\n    945 F.2d at 534\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Even assuming the state statute does not grant the City a super-priority over the USA, the City argues that the statute allows it to step into the shoes of and have priority over the DOL's prior liens. Doc. # 150-2 at 9-10. This argument presumes that state law should govern the priority of two state-created tax liens. But \"once the [federal] tax lien has attached to the taxpayer's state-created interests, we enter the province of federal law, which we have consistently held determines the priority of competing liens asserted against the taxpayer's property or rights to property.\"\n   <em>\n    Aquilino v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6165941\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/363/509/#p513\">\n    363 U.S. 509\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 513-14,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6165941\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/363/509/#p513\">\n    80 S.Ct. 1277\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6165941\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/363/509/#p513\">\n    4 L.Ed.2d 1365\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1960). The City has not pointed to any exception to this general rule, and the Court's research does not reveal any.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Moreover, even if state law were applicable, I am not convinced that \u00a7 12-195b gives a super-priority to municipal liens on\n   personal property over statutory state tax liens. The statute gives priority to liens, security interests, and other encumbrances of record \"under the Connecticut Uniform Commercial Code.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Conn.%20Gen.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2012\">\n    Conn. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 12\n   </extracted-citation>\n   -195b(b). The statute says nothing about priority over statutorily created tax liens. In sum, the City's liens do not have priority over the previously perfected liens of the USA or the DOL.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   For its part, the DOL argues that it is entitled to the funds to satisfy its liens securing unpaid taxes for the first and second quarters of 2011 and a 2010 special assessment, because the DOL\n   <em>\n    filed\n   </em>\n   its liens with the Secretary of the State before the USA\n   <em>\n    filed\n   </em>\n   its federal tax liens with the Secretary of the State. I do not agree. \"A federal tax lien, described as a 'secret lien,' is effective\n   <em>\n    upon assessment\n   </em>\n   against all persons, even in the absence of recordation of the lien.\"\n   <em>\n    Don King Prods., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10522995\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/945/529/#p534\">\n    945 F.2d at 533\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). The DOL filed its lien on September 28, 2011, after the USA had already made assessments on September 20, 2010, March 28, 2011, and June 20, 2011. The DOL's liens are inferior to the liens arising from those prior assessments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Attorney's Fees\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Plaintiff seeks attorney's fees totaling $37,113.98. According to the Connecticut interpleader statute, a court may award attorney's fees.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Conn.%20Gen.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2052-484\">\n    Conn. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 52-484\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Generally speaking, a reasonable award of fees and costs to a plaintiff in an interpleader case is appropriate if plaintiff is \"(1) a disinterested stakeholder, (2) who had conceded liability, (3) has deposited the disputed funds into court, and (4) has sought a discharge from liability.\"\n   <em>\n    Septembertide Pub., B.V. v.

The parties do not dispute that these elements are satisfied. Plaintiff concedes, however, that its claim for attorney's fees from the interpleaded fund cannot diminish the recovery of the USA on its federal tax liens.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Some courts have extended the rule protecting the federal government's recovery to the States.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hinkley &amp; Donovan v.

At least one court in this circuit has followed\n   <em>\n    Hinkley &amp; Donovan\n   </em>\n   and explained that, in a battle between the state coffer and a disinterested stakeholder ensnared in an interpleader action, equity favors the public fisc given that the stakeholder, an escrow agent, could have taken precautions to ensure it was paid for its middle-man duties.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cohen v.

Likewise, auctioneers such as plaintiff\n   have also long found themselves subject to competing claims necessitating a resort to interpleader.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bleeker v.

Plaintiff here had advance notice of competing claims in view of the fact that the government claimants filed liens on the public record before plaintiff was engaged to auction the machines and accept a fee for its services.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Balancing these considerations, I conclude that plaintiff should receive a modest attorney's fee award for the reasonable costs it incurred by resorting to the filing of an interpleader action. The bulk of plaintiff's accrued legal fees in this case are, in large part, a consequence of its inability to secure a discharge in light of Chapman's counterclaim-a cost that should not be borne by the DOL.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Accordingly, plaintiff is awarded $5,000 in attorney's fees. The Court concludes that this is a reasonable fee award for bringing the type of interpleader action filed here.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lyle v.

The Court awards plaintiff $5,000 in attorney's fees, which sum shall be deducted from the recovery of the DOL.
