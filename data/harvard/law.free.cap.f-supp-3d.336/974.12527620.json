First, the parties dispute the proper disposition\n   of Plaintiffs' remaining Phase One counts in light of the Eighth Circuit's decision. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. Nos. 1095, 1097, 1100, 1102.) Second, Defendants seek summary judgment on all Phase Two counts. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. Nos. 1095, 1097, 1102, 1105.) Plaintiffs oppose summary judgment and assert that the class should be decertified with respect to these counts. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. Nos. 1100, 1106.) Third, Defendants ask the Court to apportion the cost of the Rule 706 Experts to Plaintiffs. (Doc. Nos. 1095, 1097, 1102.) Plaintiffs oppose this request. (Doc. No. 1100.) For the reasons set forth below, all remaining claims raised in Plaintiffs' Third Amended Complaint shall be dismissed with prejudice. The Court shall reserve determination on the final apportionment of Rule 706 Expert costs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   This case has an extensive and complex history which has been discussed at length in prior orders. The Court incorporates by reference the factual background in the Court's February 2, 2015 Memorandum Opinion and Order addressing Defendants' prior Motion for Summary Judgment (Doc. No. 828), as well as the factual findings from Phase One of trial contained in the Court's June 17, 2015 Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order (Doc. No. 966). The Court assumes familiarity with these and other relevant orders and only briefly summarizes the relevant background here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiffs are individuals residing at the Minnesota Sex Offender Program (the \"MSOP\") who are civilly committed under Minnesota Statute \u00a7 253D, the Minnesota Civil Commitment and Treatment Act (\"MCTA\"). (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 635 (\"Third Am. Compl\") \u00b6 2.) The fourteen named Plaintiffs represent a class certified pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(2), consisting of \"[a]ll patients currently civilly committed to [the MSOP] pursuant to Minn. Stat \u00a7 253B.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 203.) Plaintiffs' lawsuit challenges the constitutionality of the MCTA on its face and as applied, as well as various aspects of the MSOP's operation and treatment regime. (\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Third Am. Compl. \u00b6 1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Specifically, Plaintiffs' Third Amended Complaint raises the following thirteen claims: (I) Minnesota Statute \u00a7 253D is facially unconstitutional; (II) Minnesota Statute \u00a7 253D is unconstitutional as applied; (III) Defendants have failed to provide treatment in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and the Minnesota Constitution; (IV) Defendants have failed to provide treatment in violation of the MCTA; (V) Defendants have denied Plaintiffs the right to be free from punishment in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and the Minnesota Constitution; (VI) Defendants have denied Plaintiffs the right to less restrictive alternative confinement in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and the Minnesota Constitution; (VII) Defendants have denied Plaintiffs the right to be free from inhumane treatment in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and the Minnesota Constitution; (VIII) Defendants have denied Plaintiffs the right to religion and religious freedom in violation of the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution; (IX) Defendants have unreasonably restricted free speech and free association in violation of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution and the Minnesota Constitution; (X) Defendants have conducted unreasonable searches and seizures in violation of the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution and the Minnesota Constitution; (XI) Defendants have violated court ordered treatment; (XII) Defendants Jesson, Benson, Moser, Lundquist, Johnston, and H\u00e9bert have breached\n   Plaintiffs' contractual rights; and (XIII) Defendants Jesson, Benson, Moser, Lundquist, Johnston, and H\u00e9bert have tortiously interfered with contractual rights and have intentionally violated Minn. Stat. \u00a7 253B.03, subd. 7. (Third Am. Compl. at 59-84.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On February 2, 2015, the Court issued an order denying Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment on all counts in Plaintiffs' Third Amended Complaint. (Doc. No. 828.) The matter proceeded to trial in two phases. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 647.) The Court explained the two phases of trial as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   Phase One will be comprised of the presentation of evidence and argument on the following issues: (1) whether Minnesota Statute Chapter 253D is unconstitutional on its face and as applied; (2) whether the treatment provided is constitutionally and/or statutorily infirm; (3) whether the treatment program complies with court-ordered treatment; (4) whether confinement is tantamount to unconstitutional punitive detention; and (5) whether less restrictive alternatives to confinement are constitutionally required.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   Phase Two shall be comprised of the presentation of evidence and argument on the following issues: (1) whether confinement conditions constitute unconstitutional restrictions on freedom of speech, religion, and association; (2) whether confinement procedures constitute unconstitutional searches and seizures; (3) whether the treatment program and its implementation constitutes a breach of contract, tortious interference with contract, and intentional violation of Minnesota Statute Section 253B.03(7).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2.) Phase One of trial took place between February 9, 2015 and March 18, 2015. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. Nos. 839, 908.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On June 17, 2015, the Court issued its Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order, granting Plaintiffs' request for declaratory relief on Counts I and II. (Doc. No. 966 at 75.) The Court stated, \"[b]ecause the Court finds the program is unconstitutional on its face and as applied (Counts I and II), and because any remedy fashioned will address the issues raised in the remaining Phase One Counts, the Court need not address Counts III, V, VI, and VII.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 65.) The Court noted that its \"determination that the MSOP and its governing civil commitment statutes are unconstitutional concludes Phase One of this case.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5.) The Court also reiterated that \"Counts VIII, IX, and X, will be tried in the second phase of trial ('Phase Two').\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 76.) On October 29, 2015, the Court issued a First Interim Relief Order directing injunctive relief to remedy the court's findings of unconstitutionality. (Doc. No. 1035.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Defendants appealed the Court's June 17, 2015 and October 29, 2015 Orders to the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals. (Doc. No. 1036.) On January 3, 2017, the Eighth Circuit issued an opinion \"revers[ing] the district court's finding of a constitutional violation and vacat[ing] the injunctive order.\"\n   <em>\n    Karsjens v. Piper\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12176341\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/845/394/#p411\">\n    845 F.3d 394\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 411 (8th Cir. 2017). It remanded the case to this Court \"for further proceedings on the remaining claims in the Third Amended Complaint.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12176341\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/845/394/#p411\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Following a series of stays during which Plaintiff sought further review at the United States Supreme Court, the Court and the parties met for a Status Conference on October 25, 2017. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. Nos. 1080,\n   1086, 1093.) Thereafter, Defendants filed a renewed Motion for Summary Judgment, seeking summary judgment on Counts VIII, IX, and X, as well as apportionment of the Rule 706 Expert costs to Plaintiffs. In briefing this motion, Defendants also briefed the issue of how the Court should address the remaining Phase One counts (Counts III, V, VI, and VII) in light of the Eighth Circuit's decision. (Doc. No. 1095.) The parties fully briefed these issues, and the Court heard argument on February 5, 2018. (Doc. Nos. 1097, 1100, 1102, 1103.) The Court notes additional facts as necessary to resolve the pending matters, below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Remaining Phase One Counts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Defendants argue that the remaining claims in Phase One should be dismissed because these claims were determined by the Eighth Circuit's decision in\n   <em>\n    Karsjens v. Piper\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12176341\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/845/394/#p411\">\n    845 F.3d 394\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (8th Cir. 2017). Specifically, Defendants assert that, \"[f]or the same reasons the Eighth Circuit reversed the Court's substantive due process analysis as to Counts I and II, the substantive due process claims asserted in Counts III, V, VI, and VII should also be dismissed.\" (Doc. No. 1097 at 4.) According to Defendants, the remaining Phase One counts must be dismissed because the Eighth Circuit has already reviewed the trial record and determined that Defendants did not engage in conduct that shocks the conscience. Defendants also contend that the Eighth Circuit implicitly decided Counts III, V, VI, and VII, precluding further review of these claims on remand.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Plaintiffs, on the other hand, argue that the remaining Phase One counts \"have yet to be decided by the Court, and that their outcome is not dictated by the Eighth Circuit's decision with respect to Counts I and II.\" (Doc. No. 110 at 1-2.) Plaintiffs urge the Court to make \"a full analysis and ruling on these claims\" and to conclude that Plaintiffs' remaining substantive due process claims are supported by evidence of \"both conscience-shocking conduct by Defendants and the violation of a fundamental liberty right such that they should prevail.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2, 4.) According to Plaintiffs, \"[i]f the Eighth Circuit's opinion is read as broadly as Defendants suggest, then there is no path for Plaintiffs, or any civilly committed sex offender, to ever prevail on a substantive due process claim.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4-5.) Plaintiffs argue that the trial record supports a determination in their favor on the remaining substantive due process claims in Counts III, V, VI, and VII because Defendants were deliberately indifferent to a substantial risk of harm to Plaintiffs, and such conduct amounts to conscience-shocking behavior.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

On Plaintiffs' facial due process claim in Count I, the Eighth Circuit stated that \"the Supreme Court ... has never declared that persons who pose a significant danger to themselves or others possess a fundamental liberty interest in freedom from physical restraint.\"\n   <em xmlns=\"http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HLS.Libr.US_Case_Law.Schema.Case_Body:v1\">\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12176341\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/845/394/#p411\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Thus, it held that \"the proper standard of scrutiny to be applied ... is whether MCTA bears a rational relationship to a legitimate government purpose.\"\n   <em xmlns=\"http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HLS.Libr.US_Case_Law.Schema.Case_Body:v1\">\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12176341\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/845/394/#p411\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12176341\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/845/394/#p411\">\n    at 407-08\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The Eighth Circuit clarified that actions that meet the conscience-shocking standard must be \"egregious or outrageous\" and \"must involve conduct 'so severe ... so disproportionate to the need presented, and ... so inspired by malice or sadism rather than a merely careless or unwise excess of zeal that it amounted to a brutal and inhumane abuse of official power literally shocking to the conscience.' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12176341\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/845/394/#p411\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In discussing whether Plaintiffs' allegations implicated a fundamental liberty interest, the Eighth Circuit stated, \"we have previously held that although 'the Supreme Court has recognized a substantive due process right to reasonably safe custodial conditions, [it has not recognized] a broader due process right to appropriate or effective or reasonable treatment of the illness or disability that triggered the patient's involuntary confinement.' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12176341\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/845/394/#p411\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12176341\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/845/394/#p411\">\n    at 410\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Strutton v.

These claims are thus governed by the substantive due process standard outlined in the Eighth Circuit's\n   <em>\n    Karsjens\n   </em>\n   opinion. Specifically, to hold Defendants liable under Counts III, V, VI, and VII, the court must conclude that \"the state defendants' actions were conscience-shocking and [that] those actions violated a fundamental liberty interest.\"\n   <em>\n    Karsjens\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12176341\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/845/394/#p411\">\n    845 F.3d at 408\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Plaintiffs' arguments with respect to these counts center on the punitive nature of the MSOP combined with treatment and release procedures that result in indefinite confinement.

While this proposition may support an individual's challenge to a court order that restrains his liberty, however, to successfully assert a substantive due process claim in this context, the plaintiff must establish both parts of the Eighth Circuit's two-part inquiry outlined in\n   <em>\n    Karsjens\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516755\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/888/981/#p984\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516755\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/888/981/#p984\">\n    at 984\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Plaintiffs argue that their allegations in Count III center on the manner in which Defendants' treatment program blocks Plaintiffs' release from the MSOP \"rather than alleging a constitutional right to treatment per se.\" (Doc. No. 1100 at 8.) In this context, Plaintiffs argue that \"[t]he multitude of issues with the MSOP's treatment program, when considered as a system-wide problem, reach the level of conscience shocking behavior that violates due process.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9.) Plaintiffs also assert that this claim implicates the \"fundamental liberty right to be free from commitment, or bodily restraint, when the basis for the commitment no longer exists.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14.) Plaintiffs dispute that the Eighth Circuit established that Plaintiffs have no such fundamental liberty right. With respect to Count III, Defendants argue that \"[t]he Eighth Circuit explicitly rejected Plaintiffs' contention that they have a fundamental substantive due process right to treatment.\" (Doc. No. 1097 at 5.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The Court concludes that Plaintiffs have failed to establish Defendants' liability under Count III. In this circuit, committed individuals do not have a recognized \"due process right to appropriate or effective or reasonable treatment of the illness or disability that triggered the patient's involuntary confinement.\"\n   <em>\n    Karsjens\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12176341\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/845/394/#p411\">\n    845 F.3d at 410\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Strutton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3718499\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/668/549/#p557\">\n    668 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   557 ). Furthermore, the Eighth Circuit appears to reject the notion that committed individuals such as Plaintiffs have a fundamental liberty interest in freedom from unjustified confinement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 407 (\"[T]he Supreme Court ... has never declared that persons who pose a significant danger to themselves or others possess a fundamental liberty interest in freedom from physical restraint.\"). Finally, the Eighth Circuit reviewed the Phase One trial record, including this Court's finding that \"although treatment has been made available, the treatment program's structure has been an institutional failure and there is no meaningful relationship between the treatment\n   program and an end to indefinite detention.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 403, 410-11. Nonetheless, the Eighth Circuit held that Defendants' conduct was not conscience-shocking to support substantive due process liability.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 410-11 (\"[T]he class plaintiffs have failed to demonstrate that any of the identified actions of the state defendants or arguable shortcomings in the MSOP were egregious, malicious, or sadistic as is necessary to meet the conscience-shocking standard.\"). Thus, under controlling Eighth Circuit precedent, Plaintiffs' Fourteenth Amendment failure-to-provide treatment claim lacks merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Lack of Less Restrictive Alternatives Claim (Count VI)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Count VI asserts a related claim that Defendants have infringed upon Plaintiffs' constitutionally-protected right to less restrictive alternative confinement under the Fourteenth Amendment. Plaintiffs argue that the lack of less restrictive alternatives available to committed individuals is conscience-shocking. In particular, Plaintiffs contend that \"[i]ntentionally failing to provide confinement that is appropriate for the varying levels of risk presented by Plaintiffs and the Class, and actually knowing that there are committed individuals who could be properly treated and managed in less restrictive settings, is conscience shocking.\" (Doc. No. 1100 at 11.) Plaintiffs suggest that Defendants' conduct amounts to deliberate indifference that supports finding a Fourteenth Amendment substantive due process violation. Defendants, on the other hand, argue that \"[t]he Eighth Circuit ... explicitly rejected Plaintiffs' contention that due process requires the availability of less restrictive facilities.\" (Doc. No. 1097 at 6.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   As with Plaintiffs' failure-to-provide-treatment claim, the Eighth Circuit's\n   <em>\n    Karsjens\n   </em>\n   decision forecloses finding Defendants' liable under Count VI. The Eighth Circuit's statements regarding the lack of a fundamental right to treatment and the lack of a fundamental liberty interest in freedom from physical restraint strongly imply that civilly committed individuals do not retain a fundamental liberty interest in the least restrictive confinement appropriate for their risk level. What is more, the Eighth Circuit specifically acknowledged this Court's findings that \"individuals have remained confined at the MSOP even though they have completed treatment or sufficiently reduced their risk\" and that \"there are insufficient less restrictive alternatives available for transfer and no less restrictive alternatives available for initial commitment.\"\n   <em>\n    Karsjens\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12176341\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/845/394/#p411\">\n    845 F.3d at 402-03\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . It nevertheless held that \"[n]one of the ... grounds upon which the district court determined the state defendants violated the class plaintiffs' substantive due process rights in an as-applied context satisfy the conscience-shocking standard.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12176341\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/845/394/#p411\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12176341\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/845/394/#p411\">\n    at 410\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court is therefore bound by the Eighth Circuit's decision to conclude that Defendants are not liable under the Fourteenth Amendment for failing to provide less restrictive alternatives to the Plaintiff Class.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Punitive Nature of Confinement Claims (Counts V, VII)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Counts V and VII challenge the punitive nature of confinement at the MSOP based on the asserted rights under the Fourteenth Amendment to be free from punishment and inhumane treatment. With respect to these claims, Plaintiffs argue \"that commitment to the MSOP continues in duration beyond a time that it is constitutionally permissible.\" (Doc. No. 1100 at 12.) Plaintiffs emphasize that \"Defendants do not even know whether hundreds of Plaintiffs and Class members continue to meet the constitutional criteria for commitment,\" and highlight the barriers the MSOP has imposed in the reduction-in-custody\n   process. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) On the merits of Counts V and VII, Defendants argue that Plaintiffs' theory challenging the punitive nature of the MSOP fails under the Fourteenth Amendment and the Eighth Circuit's application of the shocks-the-conscience standard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The Court concludes that the Eighth Circuit's holdings and reasoning preclude finding a substantive due process violation under Counts V and VII. Notwithstanding this Court's finding holding that the MCTA \"results in a punitive effect and application contrary to the purpose of civil commitment,\" the Eighth Circuit reversed the Court's finding of liability under the Fourteenth Amendment.\n   <em>\n    Karsjens\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12176341\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/845/394/#p411\">\n    845 F.3d at 402\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Ultimately, the Eighth Circuit reviewed the Phase One record and determined that \"the class plaintiffs have failed to demonstrate that any of the identified actions of the state defendants or arguable shortcomings in the MSOP were egregious, malicious, or sadistic as is necessary to meet the conscience-shocking standard.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12176341\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/845/394/#p411\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12176341\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/845/394/#p411\">\n    at 410-11\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In light of these conclusions and the applicable standard for imposing substantive due process liability, the Court concludes that Defendants are not liable under Counts V and VII.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <strong>\n    4. Plaintiffs' Unconstitutionally Punitive Theory\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Alternatively, Plaintiffs contend that they should prevail on their remaining Phase One claims because Defendants are unconstitutionally punishing civilly committed individuals. Plaintiffs assert that \"[w]hether commitment to the MSOP is punitive, as alleged in each of these claims, has not yet been determined by the Court,\" and that the Eighth Circuit has not identified the proper standard by which to analyze such allegations. (Doc. No. 1100 at 5.) According to Plaintiffs, the trial record supports a finding that \"Plaintiffs' commitment to the MSOP under the Act is punitive in effect\" based on the treatment, living conditions, and discharge process, \"the consequence of which is effectively life-long punitive detention.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16.) Plaintiffs also point to the lack of periodic risk assessments conducted at the MSOP and argue that \"[h]olding Plaintiffs and Class members beyond such a time as they meet commitment standards, as well as not even knowing whether people should continue to be confined, is certainly not rationally related to a nonpunitive purpose, the rendering the Act punitive in effect.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 21.) In short, Plaintiffs argue that the record supports a finding that the MCTA is punitive and therefore unconstitutional under Counts III, V, VI, and VII.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   In response, Defendants contend that Plaintiffs are merely repeating arguments that have been rejected by the Eighth Circuit. In particular, Defendants note that \"the Eighth Circuit considered and rejected Plaintiffs' theory that the MSOP 'results in a punitive effect and application contrary to the purpose of civil commitment' in violation of substantive due process.\" (Doc.

Regardless of the theory of liability alleged, Plaintiffs' Fourteenth Amendment substantive due process claims are analyzed under the two-part test identified by the Eighth Circuit in its\n   <em>\n    Karsjens\n   </em>\n   opinion. Furthermore, the Eighth Circuit has explicitly held that Defendants' actions, as revealed in Phase One of trial, do not rise to the conscience-shocking level necessary to support Fourteenth Amendment substantive due process liability. Even if this Court were free to conclude that the MSOP and Defendants' implementation of the MCTA amount to punishment of individuals who are subject to civil commitment, the Eighth Circuit's decision compels the conclusion that Defendants have not engaged in conscience-shocking conduct to support the imposition of liability under the Fourteenth Amendment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   For the reasons stated above, in light of the Eighth Circuit's decision, the Court finds that Defendants are not liable under Plaintiffs' remaining Phase One claims.

Plaintiffs also contend, however, that \"[t]he Court has the discretion, and the obligation, to decertify a class where class treatment is no longer appropriate, even where the initial certification has not been challenged.\" (Doc. No. 1106 at 1.) According to Plaintiffs, \"[a]s this case has progressed through discovery, trial, and appeals, it has become apparent that class treatment is not appropriate for the Phase Two claims\" because Defendants' conduct in applying various MSOP policies \"[does not] apply generally to the class.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2 (quoting Fed.

In Plaintiff's view, \"the Court has a duty to decertify the Class for the Phase two claims and allow Plaintiffs and Class member[s] to pursue any claims they may have on an individual basis.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Once a class is certified pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23, the court retains a continuing duty to assure the propriety of certification.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hervey v.

No. 203 at 11.) Among others, the Court identified the following common questions of law or fact applicable to the Class:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   \"Whether Defendants violated Plaintiffs' and Class members' rights to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures as protected by the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution; [and] ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   \"Whether Defendants violated Plaintiffs' and Class members' rights to freedom of expression, speech, and religious exercise as protected by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution[.]\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6-7.) The Court also concluded that \"resolution of the Plaintiffs' claims will necessarily remedy the injuries suffered by all potential Class members.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7.) Finally, the Court emphasized the shared interests between the named plaintiffs and the proposed class, noting that \"they share the common goal of being housed in a humane, therapeutic environment while receiving adequate treatment that gives them a realistic opportunity for release.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   As Plaintiffs noted in their brief in response to Defendants' renewed Motion for Summary Judgment, Counts VIII, IX, and X \"all claim that the policies and practices at the MSOP are punitive.\" (Doc. No. 1100 at 24.) Plaintiffs acknowledge that \"[c]laims regarding the application of specific policies to a particular Plaintiff or Class member are not appropriate for class treatment\" if such claims arise from conduct that is not generally applicable to the class. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 25.) Plaintiffs' theory concerning these claims, however, is \"that when viewed collectively, these policies are clear violations of Plaintiffs' and Class members' constitutional rights.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiffs argue, \"it is these policies and practices in combination and when applied to the Class as a whole, that rise to the level of a constitutional violation, along\n   with the fact that they are applied uniformly to all Plaintiffs without regard for individual treatment needs or risk levels.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   The Court declines to decertify the Class in this matter because the common questions and shared interests identified in the Court's order granting class certification remain with respect to the MSOP's generally-applicable policies and practices. To be sure, individuals residing at the MSOP may have viable individual claims regarding the application of specific policies to them as individuals. However, this fact does not foreclose the Court from considering Plaintiffs' claims on a classwide basis to the extent the policies affect the Class as a whole. Thus, the Court shall consider Plaintiffs' classwide claims on their merits to the extent they allege systemic challenges to the punitive nature of confinement at the MSOP arising under the First and Fourth Amendments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment on Phase Two Claims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Defendants argue that the Eighth Circuit's decision eliminates the rationale on which the Court previously denied summary judgment on Plaintiffs' remaining Phase Two claims. Specifically, Defendants emphasize that \"the Court based its denial of Defendants' previous summary judgment on Counts VIII, IX, and X on the proposition that they might have merit in combination with Plaintiffs' Phase One substantive due process claims regarding the conditions of their confinement.\" (Doc. No. 1097 at 23.) Defendants dispute this rationale and further contend that, in any case, it is \"disposed of by the Eighth Circuit's opinion.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Defendants point to recent caselaw decided since the Court's prior summary judgment decision that supports granting summary judgment to Defendants on Plaintiffs' Phase Two claims. Finally, Defendants assert that \"Plaintiffs continue to cite no authority for the proposition that constitutional policies somehow become unconstitutional in combination with one another.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Doc. No. 1102 at 10.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Contrary to Defendants' view, Plaintiffs argue that \"[t]he Eighth Circuit's opinion ... has no bearing on the analysis of these claims.\" (Doc. No. 1100 at 25 n.12.) Plaintiffs explain that their First, Fourth, and Fourteenth Amendment claims in Counts VIII, IX, and X all arise from the contention \"that the policies and practices at MSOP are punitive.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 24.) According to Plaintiffs, although \"[e]ach of these claims involves a number of policies and practices that, when viewed individually, may not rise to the level of a constitutional violation,\" if the Court considers the policies \"collectively,\" they amount to \"clear violations of Plaintiffs' and class members' constitutional rights.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 24-25.) In short, Plaintiffs contend that the MSOP \"operates as a punitive detention center rather than a treatment facility,\" supporting a finding of unconstitutionality.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 26.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

Impact of Phase One on Plaintiffs' Phase Two Claims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   On February 2, 2015, the Court denied Defendants' initial Motion for Summary judgment with respect to Counts VIII, IX, and X. (Doc. No. 828 at 32-39.) The Court also denied summary judgment on the Phase One claims that proceeded to trial. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16-32.) The Court stated that \"[a]t the heart of Plaintiffs' Third Amended Complaint is the contention that Minnesota's civil commitment scheme for sex offenders constitutes a punitive system of preventive detention in violation of the due process requirements of the Fourteenth Amendment.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 24.) The Court concluded that \"[t]he record before the Court indicates that Plaintiffs have presented sufficient evidence to allow a reasonable factfinder to conclude that the civil commitment system is unconstitutionally punitive in nature.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 31.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   In analyzing Plaintiffs' Phase Two claims, the Court indicated that Plaintiffs' allegations as a whole influenced the Court's conclusions, particularly with respect to Counts IX and X. Specifically, concerning Count IX, the Court stated, \"considering Plaintiffs' claims with respect to restrictions on their ability to freely associate and speak and in light of all of Plaintiffs' allegations regarding their conditions of confinement, the Court finds that Plaintiffs have presented sufficient evidence to support a claim that survives summary judgment.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 36.) Similarly, with respect to Count X, the Court held that \"[c]onsidering Plaintiffs' Fourth Amendment claim in conjunction with other evidence presented by Plaintiffs surrounding the punitive nature of their confinement, the Court determines that a genuine issue of material fact exists as to whether the search policies in this case are reasonable and appropriate.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 39.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Although the Eighth Circuit's opinion did not address Plaintiffs' Phase Two claims, its conclusions regarding Counts I and II minimized the constitutional significance of Plaintiffs' overall allegations regarding the punitive nature of confinement at the MSOP. The Eighth Circuit noted the Court's holding \"that Minnesota's civil commitment scheme for sex offenders is a punitive system without the safeguards found in the criminal justice system.\"\n   <em>\n    Karsjens\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12176341\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/845/394/#p411\">\n    845 F.3d at 402\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Rule 706 Expert Deborah McCulloch agreed that neither the MSOP's mail policy nor search policies were \"outside the bounds of what you would expect at a highly secure sex offender treatment center.\" (Doc. No. 936 (\"Tr. Vol. I\") at 147-48.) She testified that the MSOP's policies were developed with attention to the need to balance security and treatment at the facility. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 937 (\"Tr. Vol. II\") at 304-05.) Based on her review of the MSOP's policies concerning searches, client transportation, spiritual practices, media, mail, client movement, yard use, visitation, and client property, McCulloch did not identify any particular problems. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 306-11, 321, 323-25.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Dr. Naomi Freeman, another Rule 706 Expert, testified that she deferred to McCulloch's expertise concerning facility policies, but that she had no concerns with the MSOP policies she had reviewed as written. (Doc. No. 939 (\"Tr. Vol. IV\") at 876.) She also explained that her own state's civil commitment program subjects clients to room searches, monitoring of mail, and restraints during transportation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 877.) Freeman agreed that \"the policies [she] reviewed are within acceptable standards.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 878.) Dr. Robin Wilson and Dr. Michael Miner largely deferred to McCulloch and Freeman's expertise and opinions regarding the MSOP's policies. (Doc. No. 938 (\"Tr. Vol. III\") at 626-28; Doc. No. 941 (\"Tr. Vol. VI\") at 1128.) Both of these experts generally agreed that the MSOP administrators created the policies through the exercise of professional judgment.

Further, Defendants argue that the evidence establishes \"that MSOP's policies are crafted in order to balance the rights of clients with therapeutic and security interests,\" and assert that Plaintiffs have failed to establish that the MSOP's policies are not related to a legitimate therapeutic or institutional interest. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 27.) Defendants also assert that they are entitled to summary judgment on this claim to the extent it is based on the Fourteenth Amendment because Plaintiffs may not simultaneously assert a Fourteenth Amendment claim based on conduct that is alleged to violate the First Amendment, and even if they could, the record lacks evidence that Plaintiffs' fundamental rights have been violated by conduct that shocks that conscience.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Plaintiffs contend that the record establishes that the MSOP's policies and practices relating to religion impose a substantial burden on Plaintiffs' practice of religion. Plaintiffs point to a number of examples, including restrictions on room usage for religious meetings, clothing and jewelry restrictions, restrictions on religious articles, and restrictive policies governing meetings with clergy. Plaintiffs assert that they may face disciplinary measures that could impact treatment\n   progress if they fail to follow the MSOP's restrictive policies regarding religious practices. According to Plaintiffs, \"[t]hese policies and practices substantially burden Plaintiffs' ability to engage in their sincerely held religious beliefs and are not related to legitimate facility safety concerns or therapeutic interests.\" (Doc.

Even if Plaintiffs could establish that Defendants' policies respecting religion impose a substantial burden on Class members' religious practices, Plaintiffs have failed to identify record evidence by which a jury could conclude that the MSOP's policies applied to the Class as a whole are not reasonably related to legitimate therapeutic and institutional interests.

Specifically, Defendants point to caselaw which has upheld the MSOP's mail policy, phone policy, media policy, and vendor policy against First Amendment challenge. Contrary to Plaintiffs' position, Defendants argue, \"there is no legal authority for [the Plaintiffs'] belief that the conglomeration of a number of constitutional policies can result in something unconstitutional.\" (Doc. No. 1102 at 13.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Plaintiffs contend that the MSOP's policies infringe their speech and association rights under the First Amendment.

In particular, the Phase One trial testimony of the Rule 706 Experts as well as caselaw evaluating the MSOP policies informs this Court's conclusions with respect to the policies challenged under this claim. Plaintiffs have failed to raise a genuine dispute over whether Defendants' policies implicating speech and association are an unreasonable restriction on Plaintiffs' First Amendment rights as applied to the Class as a whole.

No. 1097 at 12.) In addition, Defendants emphasize that the Plaintiffs' indigent status does not preclude the Court from apportioning the cost of expert compensation to them. To support their request, Defendants point to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(d)(1) under which a prevailing party may recover its costs in litigation. In short, Defendants argue, \"Plaintiffs[ ] lost and should\n   have to pay for the experts they wanted.\" (Doc. No. 1102 at 8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   Plaintiffs dispute Defendants' characterization that the Court appointed the Rule 706 Experts for their benefit, noting that the Rule 706 Experts' work was developed based on input from both parties. Plaintiffs also emphasize \"that Defendants have relied on, and continue to rely on, the Rule 706 Experts' findings and testimony.\" (Doc. No. 1100 at 23.) Finally, Plaintiffs point out that they are indigent and argue that the Court may appropriately apportion the Rule 706 Expert costs to Defendants on this basis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   The Court concludes that an order apportioning the costs of the Rule 706 Experts to Plaintiffs would be premature at this stage. The Court reserves the right to revisit the issue of apportioning these costs pursuant to Rule 54 following the entry of final judgment and upon complete briefing by the parties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   The Court's determinations, above, resolve Plaintiffs' remaining Phase One and Phase Two claims. After many years of vigorous advocacy on all sides, the\n   <em>\n    Karsjens\n   </em>\n   litigation has effectively reached its end. With respect to Plaintiffs' remaining Phase One claims, the Court's conclusions are largely dictated by the Eighth Circuit's decision reversing this Court's finding of a constitutional violation under the Fourteenth Amendment. In light of the applicable substantive due process standard outlined in the Eighth Circuit's opinion and its broad holding that \"the class plaintiffs have failed to demonstrate that any of the identified actions of the state defendants or arguable shortcomings in the MSOP were egregious, malicious, or sadistic as is necessary to meet the conscience-shocking standard,\"\n   <em>\n    Karsjens\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12176341\" index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/845/394/#p411\">\n    845 F.3d at 410-11\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the Court determines that Defendants are not liable for the remaining counts in Phase One. Concerning Defendants' Phase Two claims challenging the conditions of confinement at the MSOP under the First and Fourth Amendments on a classwide basis, the Court concludes that there is no genuine issue of material fact in dispute and Defendants are entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   With respect to Phase Two, the Court emphasizes that its conclusions solely address Plaintiffs' classwide claims of systemic constitutional violations. To the extent individual class members residing at the MSOP seek to raise individual claims based on alleged violations of their constitutional rights, it is this Court's view that such claims are not foreclosed by the Court's determinations relating to Counts VIII, IX, and X of Plaintiffs' Third Amended Complaint. This suggestion applies, for example, to individual claims that the MSOP's application of particular policies has infringed a committed individual's right to freely exercise his religion, to exercise protected speech rights, to freely associate with individuals both within and outside of the MSOP, and to be free from an unreasonable search.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   A number of lawsuits filed by civilly committed individuals at the MSOP are currently stayed pending the resolution of this case. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. Nos. 1080, 1083.) As noted above, it is this Court's view that its conclusions regarding Plaintiffs' classwide claims will leave any individual claims in these and future lawsuits unresolved. The prospect of these many individual lawsuits going forward may be a compelling reason for all parties to sit down in an attempt to reach an agreement to settle any remaining issues in this case, with or without the assistance of the Court, instead of incurring the significant costs and delay associated with pursuing an appeal. To do so might well serve the best interests of the\n   parties, the public interest, and the interests of justice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   Finally, the Court expresses its view that some of the facts revealed during the lengthy Phase One trial in this matter are indeed shocking to this Court's conscience. In particular, the Court finds the circumstances surrounding the confinement of Rhonda Bailey, the MSOP's sole civilly committed female, to be truly conscience-shocking. Furthermore, the Court views the continued confinement of elderly individuals with a low likelihood of re-offense as an egregious affront to liberty, particularly in light of the pervasive sense of hopelessness at the MSOP. Similarly, the confinement of individuals with cognitive disabilities or juvenile-only offenders who could safely reside in a less restrictive alternative facility or in the community remains of great concern to the Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   Notwithstanding these observations and concerns, however, the Eighth Circuit's reversal of this Court's liability findings in large part compels the conclusions the Court reaches today. The Court hopes that the public and all stakeholders will carefully consider the complex issues raised by this litigation, moving forward in a manner that balances the interests of public safety, fundamental justice, and basic human dignity. Justice requires no less.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   <strong>\n    ORDER\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   Based upon the foregoing,\n   <strong>\n    IT IS HEREBY ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   1.
