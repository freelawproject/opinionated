American United Life Ins. Co.\n   </em>\n   , a case decided by a district judge in the Western District of Louisiana, holding that OGHS is a political subdivision of the State and that a policy established by OGHS for its employees\n   was exempt from ERISA coverage.\n   <footnotemark>\n    28\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff also cites\n   <em>\n    Andrus v. Unum Life Insurance Company of America\n   </em>\n   , a case decided by a district judge in the Eastern District of Louisiana, holding that OGHS is a political subdivision of the State and that the same policy at issue in this case was exempt from ERISA coverage.\n   <footnotemark>\n    29\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, Plaintiff asserts that \"there can be no question that Opelousas General Health System is a governmental entity,\" and \"any Plan or Policy established and/or maintained by Opelousas General Health System and/or Opelousas General Hospital is exempt under ERISA.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    30\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, Plaintiff urges the Court to grant the motion for summary judgment and find that the plan is exempt from ERISA coverage.\n   <footnotemark>\n    31\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Defendant's Arguments in Opposition to Plaintiff's Motion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In response, Defendant first states that it does not dispute that HSD is a political subdivision of the State of Louisiana.\n   <footnotemark>\n    32\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, Defendant contends that OGHS is a trust established for a public purpose, and is not a political subdivision of the State of Louisiana.\n   <footnotemark>\n    33\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Defendant argues that the exhibits submitted in connection with this motion establish that OGHS became the operating entity of the hospital by way of a resolution transferring the management of the hospital from the Hospital Corporation of the Sisters Marianites of the Holy Cross to OGHS.\n   <footnotemark>\n    34\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendant contends that OGHS did not become a political subdivision of the State by operating the hospital under the terms of this agreement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    35\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   According to Defendant, HSD and OGHS are distinct legal entities, and only HSD is a political subdivision of the State.\n   <footnotemark>\n    36\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendant asserts that Plaintiff's position is based on the erroneous premise that HSD and OGHS are the same legal entity, and Defendant argues there is no documentation showing that HSD ever became OGHS, as Plaintiff suggests.\n   <footnotemark>\n    37\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendant contends that Plaintiff misreads the holding of the Louisiana Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Bertrand.\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    38\n   </footnotemark>\n   According to Defendant, the Louisiana Supreme Court held that HSD was a political subdivision and that OGHS was a public trust, not a political subdivision.\n   <footnotemark>\n    39\n   </footnotemark>\n   Moreover, Defendant contends that HSD has no control over the employment or benefit operations of OGHS, and OGHS establishes and maintains its own employee benefit plan for its employees.\n   <footnotemark>\n    40\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Defendant contends that the district court cases cited by Plaintiff are merely interlocutory orders that should not be considered, even as persuasive authority, because Defendant alleges that the Louisiana Supreme Court has decided the question presented.\n   <footnotemark>\n    41\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendant acknowledges that the issue as to whether the OGHS plan is governed by ERISA is a question that is to be determined under federal law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    42\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, Defendant posits that \"it is appropriate for the highest court of the state to make a determination as to whether a specific entity is a political subdivision\n   of the state.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    43\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because there is no governing federal authority that is determinative of the issue, Defendant submits that this Court should look to the ruling of the Louisiana Supreme Court that definitively established that OGHS is not a political subdivision of the State.\n   <footnotemark>\n    44\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Plaintiff's Arguments in Further Support of the Motion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   In the reply brief, Plaintiff contends that Defendant \"ignores the factors which establish that OGHS is in fact a political subdivision or, at a minimum, an agency or instrumentality of a state or political subdivision.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    45\n   </footnotemark>\n   According to Plaintiff, OGHS was created as a public trust and specifically refers to itself as an instrumentality of the State.\n   <footnotemark>\n    46\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff also asserts that OGHS is a \"public corporation of the beneficiary\" and subject to the \"Public Contracts Law, Public Records Law, Public Meetings Law, Code of Ethics, and the Bond Validation Procedures Law.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    47\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff notes that all of OGHS's meetings are open to the public.\n   <footnotemark>\n    48\n   </footnotemark>\n   Furthermore, Plaintiff states that the trust is exempt from all state and federal taxes and the property of the trust is considered public property.\n   <footnotemark>\n    49\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Plaintiff also disputes Defendant's assertion that OGHS operates independently from HSD and is not subject to its supervision and control.\n   <footnotemark>\n    50\n   </footnotemark>\n   According to Plaintiff, the Board of Trustees, which conducts the affairs of OGHS, is appointed by the HSD, and five of the nine trustees are commissioners of HSD.\n   <footnotemark>\n    51\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff contends that the Commission of HSD has the power to remove a trustee of OGHS for cause.\n   <footnotemark>\n    52\n   </footnotemark>\n   Moreover, Plaintiff asserts that the Commission must approve OGHS's bylaws, and the Commission has the power to veto the bylaws or propose changes to them.\n   <footnotemark>\n    53\n   </footnotemark>\n   Therefore, Plaintiff asserts that \"[t]here is no question that control of OGHS is vested with Hospital Service District No. 2, and the District Commission controls the governing board of OGHS.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    54\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   According to Plaintiff, in\n   <em>\n    Bertrand\n   </em>\n   the Louisiana Supreme Court held that HSD could raise funds through a public trust without a vote from the citizens of St. Landry Parish.\n   <footnotemark>\n    55\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, Plaintiff notes that the Louisiana Supreme Court was not analyzing OGHS's status under ERISA and did not address whether the public trust was created by the State so as to constitute a political subdivision of the State.\n   <footnotemark>\n    56\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Finally, Plaintiff contends there is no legal authority to prevent the Court from reviewing the district court cases cited in Plaintiff's original brief.\n   <footnotemark>\n    57\n   </footnotemark>\n   At a minimum, Plaintiff argues \"the interim ruling in\n   <em>\n    Andrus\n   </em>\n   is more relevant to this Court than the ruling in\n   <em>\n    Bertrand\n   </em>\n   , which is clearly\n   distinguishable from the facts herein.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    58\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     B.

Defendant's Arguments in Support of the Motion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   In the motion for summary judgment, Defendant again asserts that in\n   <em>\n    Bertrand\n   </em>\n   the Louisiana Supreme Court held that HSD was a political subdivision and that OGHS was a public trust, not a political subdivision.\n   <footnotemark>\n    59\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendant notes that \"OGHS's status as a political subdivision is currently at issue in pending litigation in the Eastern District of Louisiana involving the same Unum policy.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    60\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendant argues that the district court in\n   <em>\n    Andrus\n   </em>\n   incorrectly determined that OGHS was a political subdivision, but Defendant asserts that \"[t]he district court's interim ruling cannot be considered as binding or even persuasive authority for the proposition that the OGHS plan is exempt from coverage under ERISA.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    61\n   </footnotemark>\n   Therefore, Defendant contends that this Court should find that OGHS is not a political subdivision and the plan is governed by ERISA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    62\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Defendant points to the application for group long term disability coverage that OGHS submitted to Defendant on July 16, 2009, where OGHS identified itself as a \"Non-Profit Organization,\" not as a \"Government Organization.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    63\n   </footnotemark>\n   According to Defendant, the plan is only offered to employees who are directly employed by OGHS.\n   <footnotemark>\n    64\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Defendant asserts that in 1953 the St. Landry Parish Police Jury, a political subdivision of the State of Louisiana, adopted an ordinance creating HSD.\n   <footnotemark>\n    65\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendant contends that HSD is statutorily designated as a political subdivision, which operates through a five member Board of Commissioners, and has the authority to incur debt, expropriate property, issue bonds, and levy taxes.\n   <footnotemark>\n    66\n   </footnotemark>\n   According to Defendant, HSD is also statutorily authorized to enter into an agreement with a hospital management firm to manage, operate, and administer a hospital for the benefit of the hospital service district.\n   <footnotemark>\n    67\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendant also notes that HSD \"has never operated the hospital directly, nor has it employed its personnel or established an employee welfare benefit plan for hospital employees.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    68\n   </footnotemark>\n   According to Defendant, in 1971, a trust indenture was entered with certain citizens of Opelousas, Louisiana, for the purpose of financing, operating, constructing, leasing, renting, managing, and administering the hospital facilities, which became known as the Opelousas General Health Authority and operates under the trade name OGHS.\n   <footnotemark>\n    69\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Defendant asserts that under Fifth Circuit law an entity is a political subdivision if it is either: \"(1) created directly by the state, so as to constitute departments or administrative arms of the government, or\n   (2) administered by individuals who are responsible to public officials or to the general electorate.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    70\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendant contends that OGHS was not created directly by the State of Louisiana.\n   <footnotemark>\n    71\n   </footnotemark>\n   Although ERISA is governed by federal law, Defendant contends that the Fifth Circuit has recognized that \"state law statutes and cases on the issue of whether an employer is considered to be a political subdivision are relevant to the inquiry when examining whether the entity was created directly by the state so as to constitute a department or an administrative arm of the government.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    72\n   </footnotemark>\n   Again, Defendant argues that in\n   <em>\n    Bertrand\n   </em>\n   the Louisiana Supreme Court held that OGHS was a public trust, not a political subdivision.\n   <footnotemark>\n    73\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendant also contends that this case is similar to\n   <em>\n    Shannon v. Shannon\n   </em>\n   , where the Seventh Circuit determined that a nonprofit corporation that operated a hospital pursuant to a lease with the City was created by ten incorporators \"under the laws of Wisconsin as a private, non-stock, nonprofit corporation.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    74\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Furthermore, Defendant contends that OGHS is not administered by individuals who are responsible to public officials or to the general public.\n   <footnotemark>\n    75\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendant contends that HSD is the beneficiary of, but does not administer, the trust.\n   <footnotemark>\n    76\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendant also cites\n   <em>\n    NLRB v. Highview, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , where the Fifth Circuit held that the political subdivision exemption of the National Labor Relations Act did not apply to a nonprofit hospital corporation which operated a nursing home located on county land.\n   <footnotemark>\n    77\n   </footnotemark>\n   Here, because OGHS operates as a distinct entity that is completely independent from HSD and is not administered by individuals who are responsible to public officials or the general electorate, Defendant contends that OGHS is not a political subdivision of the State.\n   <footnotemark>\n    78\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    2.

(2) OGHS does not operate the hospital on behalf of the HSD or the State as the district does not have any control over the operation of the hospital and no claim to OGHS's revenues; (3) neither the Police Jury nor HSD have the powers or interests of an owner; (4) HSD has no control or supervision over the day-to-day operations of OGHS; (5) a state statute authorizes the creation of public trusts but did not mandate the creation of OGHS; and (6) OGHS has complete financial autonomy from the Parish and State.\n   <footnotemark>\n    100\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   \"While HSD may have some involvement in the removal of a trustee for cause,\" Defendant contends that \"there is absolutely no evidence that HSD has any control whatsoever over OGHS's day-to-day operation of the hospital or the provision of employee benefit plans for its employees.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    101\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendant asserts that OGHS operates the hospital independent from any governmental entity by paying its own employees, posting its own job openings, and providing its own benefits.\n   <footnotemark>\n    102\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendant contends that OGHS does not receive any funding from a governmental entity, and has complete financial autonomy from HSD and the State.\n   <footnotemark>\n    103\n   </footnotemark>\n   Furthermore, while members of HSD sit on the Board of Trustees of OGHS, Defendant contends that \"it is clearly not in their capacity as\n   public officials because the HSD has no control over hospital operations.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    104\n   </footnotemark>\n   Therefore, Defendant asserts that \"[t]he balance of factors here, including the lack of State or Parish control over OGHS's operations, the lack of governmental funding, and the lack of indicia of governmental employment, all establish that OGHS is not an agency or instrumentality of the state or one of its political subdivisions.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    105\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Defendant argues that OGHS was not created directly by the State, and instead was created by a written trust instrument.\n   <footnotemark>\n    106\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendant concedes, as argued by Plaintiff, that OGHS's meetings and records are open to the public, the trust indenture and its bylaws must be approved by the HSD, OGHS does not file an annual Form 5500, and OGHS is subject to monitoring by a governmental agency.\n   <footnotemark>\n    107\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, Defendant asserts that these factors are not determinative of whether ERISA governs OGHS's employee benefit plan.\n   <footnotemark>\n    108\n   </footnotemark>\n   Furthermore, Defendant argues that \"OGHS's tax-exempt status does not establish that it is a governmental entity as that status is granted to many non-profit organizations.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    109\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Finally, Defendant argues that \"OGHS is not administered by individuals who are responsible to public officials or the general electorate, as claimed by plaintiff, simply because the board of directors must include elected or appointed public officials.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    110\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendant asserts that \"HSD and OGHS are distinct legal entities and this distinction cannot be disregarded because the class of members of each happens to be coextensive.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    111\n   </footnotemark>\n   Specifically, Defendant notes that HSD does not manage OGHS's operations, OGHS has unfettered discretion in carrying on its day-to-day operations, and OGHS's finances are completely separate from HSD.\n   <footnotemark>\n    112\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendant contends that one of Congress's primary reasons for exempting governmental plans from the funding requirements of ERISA was \"the ability of the governmental entities to fulfill their obligations to employees through their taxing powers\" as a substitute for minimum funding standards and plan termination insurance.\n   <footnotemark>\n    113\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because OGHS has no authority to levy taxes, Defendant avers that finding that the plan is exempt from ERISA would relieve \"OGHS's privately funded employee benefit plan from the mandatory protections that Congress requires ERISA plans to provide, effectively leaving employees with no remedy should OGHS ever encounter financial difficulties.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    114\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     III.

Sandoz\n   </em>\n   , the Louisiana Supreme Court reviewed a state trial court's order dismissing a class action lawsuit seeking to have the trust through which OGHS was formed declared invalid; and, alternatively, that the trust be prohibited from issuing revenue bonds without an election by a majority of the taxpayers of the district.\n   <footnotemark>\n    174\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Louisiana Supreme Court found that HSD was a \"subdivision of the state within the meaning of the constitution, the Public Trust Act and the police jury ordinance.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    175\n   </footnotemark>\n   Therefore, the Louisiana Supreme Court held that HSD was capable of being designated as beneficiary of a public trust.\n   <footnotemark>\n    176\n   </footnotemark>\n   Furthermore, the Louisiana Supreme Court held OGHS was not a political subdivision of the State but instead was a valid public trust that could \"issue revenue bonds without an election by a majority of the taxpayers of the district.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    177\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Although Defendant acknowledges that federal law controls the issue of whether OGHS is a political subdivision for purpose of ERISA preemption, Defendant contends that the Court should rely on\n   <em>\n    Bertrand\n   </em>\n   because it \"definitively established\" that OGHS is not a political subdivision and there is no governing federal authority that is determinative of the issue.\n   <footnotemark>\n    178\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, even if Louisiana law were determinative of this issue, Louisiana courts have recognized that a subsequent amendment to the Public Trust Act calls the\n   <em>\n    Bertrand\n   </em>\n   court's holding that OGHS is not a political subdivision into question.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Billeaudeau v. Opelousas General Hospital Authority\n   </em>\n   the Louisiana Third Circuit Court of Appeal noted that the Public Trust Act was amended in 1978, after the Louisiana Supreme Court decided\n   <em>\n    Bertrand\n   </em>\n   , to provide that \"[a]ll public trusts hereafter created or amended under this Chapter shall constitute public corporations of the beneficiary.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    179\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Louisiana Third Circuit held that \"the 1986 and 1991 amendments to the Hospital Service District No. 2 of St. Landry's Trust Indenture brought the OGH[A] within the scope of the legislative amendments throughout the years,\" making OGHA, which operates\n   under the trade name OGHS, a \"public corporation\" and political subdivision under the Louisiana Governmental Claims Act.\n   <footnotemark>\n    180\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   As discussed above, neither OGHS's bylaws nor its Trust Indenture may be changed without the consent of the Commission of HSD, which is appointed by the Parish Council. Furthermore, five of the members of the Board of Trustees for OGHS are also Commissioners of HSD, the four additional Trustees are appointed by the Commission, and officers of the Commission of HSD and the Board of Directors of OGHS are identical. Therefore, the Court finds that OGHS is a political subdivision of the State of Louisiana for the purposes of ERISA because it is \"administered by individuals who are responsible to public officials or the general electorate.\" Because the Court finds OGHS is a political subdivision of the State of Louisiana, the employee benefit plan established and maintained by OGHS is a \"governmental plan,\" which is exempt from ERISA coverage pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201003\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1003\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1).\n   <footnotemark>\n    181\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     B.

Other factors include: (1) whether there is specific legislation creating the organization; (2) the source of funds for the organization; (3) the manner in which the organization's trustees or operating board are selected; and (4) whether the applicable governmental unit considers the employees of the organization to be employees of the applicable governmental unit. Although all of the above factors are considered in determining whether an organization is an agency of a government, the mere satisfaction of one or all of the factors is not necessarily determinative.\n   <footnotemark>\n    187\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   While the Court must consider all six factors, no single factor is determinative.\n   <footnotemark>\n    188\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court must determine whether the factors, as a whole, weigh in favor or against a finding that a specific entity is an agency or instrument of a state or political subdivision.\n   <footnotemark>\n    189\n   </footnotemark>\n   Therefore, the Court considers the factors provided in these Revenue Rulings to determine whether OGHS is either an agency or instrumentality of HSD.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   First, the Court considers whether OGHS is used for a governmental purpose and performs a governmental function. The Trust Indenture provides that the trust was created for a \"public purpose ... as a public instrumentality of the state or a subdivision or agency thereof.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    190\n   </footnotemark>\n   On September 25, 1986, the Trust Indenture was amended to include Article IV, section 4.1, which states, \"The purpose of the Trust shall constitute authorized public functions or purposes held to be an essential public function conducted in the public interest....\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    191\n   </footnotemark>\n   Furthermore, Louisiana's Public Trust Act states that a public trust may be created \"to issue obligations and to provide funds for the furtherance and accomplishment of any authorized public functions,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    192\n   </footnotemark>\n   such as \"hospital, medical, health, nursery care, nursing care, clinical, ambulance, laboratory and related services and entities.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    193\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendant argues that providing hospital services is not a \"traditional government function.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    194\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, the Public Trust Act expressly provides that a public trust may be created for the \"public function\" of administering hospital and medical services. Accordingly, the Court finds this factor weighs in favor of finding OGHS is an agency or instrumentality of HSD.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Second, the Court considers whether performance of OGHS's function is on behalf of a political subdivision of the State. It is clear that OGHS performs its functions on behalf of HSD. HSD is the beneficiary of the trust, which was created \"for the use and benefit\" of HSD \"to finance, operate, construct, lease, rent, manage and administer hospital facilities.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    195\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendant's\n   argument that OGHS does not operate the hospital on behalf of the HSD because HSD does not have any control over the operation of the hospital is contradicted by the very language of the Trust Indenture, which provides that HSD is the beneficiary of the trust.\n   <footnotemark>\n    196\n   </footnotemark>\n   Therefore, this factor weighs in favor of finding that OGHS is an agency or instrumentality of HSD.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Third, the Court examines whether there are any private interests involved, or whether HSD has the powers and interests of an owner. Plaintiff acknowledges that there are private interests involved because the members of the Board of Trustees serve in their capacities as citizens, but contends that HSD has the interest of an owner.\n   <footnotemark>\n    197\n   </footnotemark>\n   The January 25, 1972 Resolution of HSD transferred \"the management and supervision of the Opelousas General Hospital\" to \"the Opelousas General Hospital Authority, a Public Trust, effective the 25th day of February, 1972, pursuant to the terms and conditions of a Management Contract executed by and between the Hospital Service District No. 2 of St. Landry Parish, Louisiana, as\n   <em>\n    Owner\n   </em>\n   and the Opelousas General Hospital Authority, a Public Trust, as Manager.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    198\n   </footnotemark>\n   Furthermore, HSD appoints and removes members of the OGHS Board of Trustees, a majority of whom are Commissioners of HSD. Accordingly, this factor weighs in favor of finding OGHS is an agency or instrumentality of HSD.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Fourth, the Court considers whether control and supervision of the organization is vested in public authority. Defendant contends that HSD has no control or supervision over the day-to-day operations of OGHS.\n   <footnotemark>\n    199\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff does not dispute that OGHS generates its own funding, hires its own employees, and provides its own benefits. The Trust Indenture provides HSD has no \"authority, power or right, whatsoever, to do or transact any business for, or on behalf of, or binding upon the Trustees or upon the Trust Estate.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    200\n   </footnotemark>\n   Conversely, as discussed above, the Board of Trustees is appointed by HSD, and five of the nine Trustees are Commissioners of HSD. Therefore, although the OGHS and HSD are distinct legal entities and HSD has no authority to do business on behalf of OGHS, control of OGHS is in fact vested with HSD as the Commission controls the Board of Trustees of OGHS. Therefore, the Court concludes that this factor weighs in favor of finding OGHS is an agency or instrumentality of HSD.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   Fifth, the Court must consider if express or implied statutory or other authority is necessary for the creation and/or use of such an instrumentality.\n   <footnotemark>\n    201\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendant acknowledges that a state statute authorizes the creation of public trusts, but no state law mandated the creation of OGHS.\n   <footnotemark>\n    202\n   </footnotemark>\n   The statute governing HSD authorizes it \"to enter into lease agreements with recognized and duly constituted nonprofit associations which are primarily engaged in the operation of hospitals.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    203\n   </footnotemark>\n   An act of the legislature did not specifically bring OGHS into existence, but Louisiana law authorizes the creation of public trusts, such as OGHS, \"for the furtherance and accomplishment of any authorized public functions\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   <footnotemark>\n    204\n   </footnotemark>\n   such as hospitals.\n   <footnotemark>\n    205\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, this factor weighs in favor of finding OGHS is an agency or instrumentality of HSD.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Sixth, the Court must consider the degree of financial autonomy. Under the terms of the Trust Indenture, all debts of OGHS are payable solely from the Trust Estate.\n   <footnotemark>\n    206\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Trust Indenture provides HSD, as beneficiary, \"shall have no liability for any bonds, notes, or indebtedness of any type whatsoever of the Trust\" and will have no \"liability for costs incurred in the operation of the Trust, or for any actions or omission of the Trustees or others representing the Trust.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    207\n   </footnotemark>\n   Further, HSD has \"no legal title, claim or right to the Trust Estate, its income, or to any part thereof, or to demand or require any partition or distribution thereof.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    208\n   </footnotemark>\n   Therefore, OGHS is financially autonomous from HSD, and this factor weighs against finding OGHS is an agency or instrumentality of a political subdivision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Considering that five of the six factors weigh in favor of finding that OGHS is an agent or instrumentality of HSD, the Court concludes that OGHS is an agency or instrumentality of HSD, which is undisputedly a political subdivision of the State of Louisiana. Therefore, the Court finds the employee benefit plan is a governmental plan exempt from ERISA's coverage pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201003\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1003\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     V.
