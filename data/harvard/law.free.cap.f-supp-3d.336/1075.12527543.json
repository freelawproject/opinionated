CHEN, United States District Judge\n   The federal government seeks to terminate the Temporary Protected Status (\"TPS\") designations for four countries: Haiti, Sudan, Nicaragua, and El Salvador. Under three prior administrations, the TPS designations of these countries have been repeatedly extended based on adverse and dangerous conditions in these countries. Under the designations, approximately 300,000 TPS beneficiaries have been allowed to stay and work in the United States because of dangerous or unsafe conditions in their home countries.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Without TPS designations, these beneficiaries will be subject to removal from the United States.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Plaintiffs in this case are TPS beneficiaries (who have resided in the United States for years) along with their U.S.-citizen children. In this suit, Plaintiffs challenge the Trump administration's decision to terminate TPS status for the affected countries. Currently pending before the Court is Plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction. Plaintiffs seek to enjoin the government from implementing or enforcing the decisions of the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security to terminate TPS designations of these countries pending a final resolution of the case on the merits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   As described below, absent injunctive relief, TPS beneficiaries and their children indisputably will suffer irreparable harm and great hardship. TPS beneficiaries who have lived, worked, and raised families in the United States (many for more than a decade), will be subject to removal. Many have U.S.-born children; those may be faced with the Hobson's choice of bringing their children with them (and tearing them away from the only country and community they have known) or splitting their families apart. In contrast, the government has failed to establish any real harm were the status quo (which has been in existence for as long as two decades) is maintained during the pendency of this litigation. Indeed, if anything, Plaintiffs and amici have established without dispute that local and national economies will be hurt if hundreds of thousands of TPS beneficiaries are uprooted and removed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The balance of hardships thus tips sharply in favor of TPS beneficiaries and their families. And Plaintiffs have made substantial showing on the merits of their claims, both on the facts and the law. They have presented a substantial record supporting their claim that the Acting Secretary or Secretary of DHS, in deciding to terminate the TPS status of Haiti, El Salvador, Nicaragua and Sudan, changed the criteria applied by the prior administrations, and did so without any explanation or justification in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act. There is also evidence that this may have been done in order to implement and justify a pre-ordained result desired by the White House. Plaintiffs have also raised serious questions\n   whether the actions taken by the Acting Secretary or Secretary was influenced by the White House and based on animus against non-white, non-European immigrants in violation of Equal Protection guaranteed by the Constitution. The issues are at least serious enough to preserve the status quo.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Having considered the parties' briefs and accompanying submissions, as well as the oral argument of counsel, the Court hereby\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS\n   </strong>\n   Plaintiffs' motion.

Once the Decision Memo is finalized, the USCIS Director passes it on to the DHS Secretary. The State Department provides further input (\n    <em>\n     e.g.\n    </em>\n    , country conditions, recommendations). At times, input can also come from other government sources, but the above is the information consistently provided to the DHS Secretary.\n    <em>\n     See generally\n    </em>\n    Rodriguez Decl.

The declarants are TPS beneficiaries who have lived in the United States for a significant number of years, some as many as twenty. Without a preliminary injunction, the declarants risk being removed. At the hearing,\n    the government conceded that there are approximately 300,000 TPS beneficiaries registered as such and that they are likely to be subject to removal.\n    <footnotemark>\n     4\n    </footnotemark>\n    TPS beneficiaries thus risk being uprooted from their homes, jobs, careers, and communities. They face removal to countries to which their children and family members may have little or no ties and which may not be safe. Those with U.S.-citizen children will be confronted with the dilemma of either bringing their children with them, giving up their children's lives in the United States (for many, the only lives they know), or being separated from their children.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    County/Citi Amici at 4 (noting that \"[t]he beneficiaries ... have hundreds of thousands of U.S.-citizen children, 192,000 born to Salvadoran beneficiaries alone\"). Understandably, this prospect is a source of great emotional distress, fear, and anxiety.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-58\">\n    For example, Ebtihal Abdalla and her husband are TPS beneficiaries from Sudan. They have been beneficiaries since the late 1990s. They have three children. One is a TPS beneficiary and has lived in the United States since she was a baby. The other two are U.S. citizens. Once Sudan's designation is terminated, her husband will be unable to work and, as he is the primary breadwinner, this will have significant impact on the family's livelihood. Furthermore, since the announcement of Sudan's termination, Ms. Abdalla has suffered bouts of uncontrollable crying and serious migraines. She has also found it difficult to eat and to leave the house. She was recently diagnosed with severe depression and prescribed medications. Ms. Abdalla's children have also been impacted by the announcement of Sudan's termination. For example, Ms. Abdalla's oldest daughter is currently at a community college. Once Sudan's termination is terminated, she will not be able to work, and she needs the work in order to help pay for tuition. She is fearful that she will not be able to attend a four-year college or university, as planned, if Sudan's TPS is terminated before she completes her coursework at the community college. As for Ms. Abdalla's youngest daughter, she is only twelve and, after learning that her family's immigration status is in jeopardy, she has struggled at school, with a teacher even expressly voicing concern.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-59\">\n    Similar testimony is provided in the declarations of Elsy Yolanda Flores De Ayala,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    De Ayala Decl.

For example, many TPS beneficiaries are part of the workforce and have a significant presence in the construction, hospitality, food service, landscaping, home health care, child care, and retail industries.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    , Docket No. 103-1 (State Amici at 9) (noting that \"an estimated 37,000-70,000 construction workers are TPS holders\"). Without a preliminary injunction, these TPS beneficiaries will no longer be able to work, thus adversely impacting state and local economies. The State Amici estimates that \"loss of legal status for these TPS holders is projected to cost $132.6 billion in GDP (due to lost earnings as well as decreased industry outputs), $5.2 billion in Social Security and Medicare contributions, and $733 million in employers' turnover costs.\" Docket No. 103-1 (State Amici at 9). Also, if TPS beneficiaries cannot work, then they will lose their employer-sponsored health care which will put a strain on public resources. Furthermore, many TPS beneficiaries are homeowners; if these TPS beneficiaries are no longer able to work, they may not be able to pay their property taxes, and their homes may become subject to foreclosure.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    , Docket No. 103-1 (State Amici at 10) (stating that \"[t]hirty-two percent of TPS holders from El Salvador and Haiti have mortgages, and almost 42 percent of Nicaraguan immigrants are homeowners\"; adding that \"Salvadoran TPS homeowners pay an estimated $100 million in property taxes annually, including up to $32 million in the Los Angeles area alone\"). Finally, TPS beneficiaries also contribute to their communities in other less tangible, but equally important, ways.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    , County/Citi Amici at 5 (noting that \"a survey of TPS recipients from El Salvador, Honduras, and Nicaragua found that 30 percent are civically active, and about 20 percent engage in community service such as volunteering with nonprofit organizations or at children's hospitals\").\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-61\">\n    The government does not dispute the practical and human hardships upon TPS beneficiaries and their children that will be caused if TPS status were terminated. Nor has the government taken issue with the estimates of adverse impact upon the economy resulting from the termination and resulting\n    <em>\n     en masse\n    </em>\n    removal of TPS beneficiaries.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-62\">\n    Indeed, the government's own documents reflect that public interest considerations weighs in favor of a preliminary injunction. Apart from adversely impacting the domestic economy, terminating TPS status may have adverse ramifications internationally. For example, in a memo dated October 2017, James Nealon, then-Assistant Secretary for International Affairs in OP &amp; S (and a former ambassador to Honduras), gave examples as to why terminating the TPS designations for,\n    <em>\n     inter alia\n    </em>\n    , Nicaragua and El Salvador would be against the United States' own interest -\n    <em>\n     e.g.\n    </em>\n    , returning aliens to these countries would put a strain on the countries' systems and \"possibly spur further irregular migration to the United States.\" Degen Decl., Ex. 161 (Memo at 2); El Salvador AR at 1 (U.S. Southern Command, making a similar point regarding El Salvador);\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    Degen Decl., Ex. 70 (U.S. embassy in El Salvador, recommending extension of TPS designation because it was in the United States' own interest). In an email dated September 2017, the Department of Defense raised concerns that termination of Sudan's TPS designation could negatively impact the United States from a foreign policy perspective.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Degen Decl., Ex. 9 (email from Department of Defense, expressing concern about draft language in Federal Register Notice regarding Sudan's TPS designation; adding that \"[w]e are entering a delicate phase in our relationship with the Government of Sudan that may set the future trajectory of the relationship for years to come, and maintaining\n    domestic and international partner support through consistent and credible messaging will be critical to achieving defense interests in Sudan\").\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-63\">\n    As noted, the government does not challenge the record evidence compiled by Plaintiffs and amici. That is, as a\n    <em>\n     factual\n    </em>\n    matter, the government does not contest any of the injuries or hardships catalogued above. Instead, the government offers only two\n    <em>\n     legal\n    </em>\n    arguments as to why there is no likelihood of irreparable injury, the balance of hardships does not tip sharply in Plaintiffs' favor, and/or the public interest weighs against a preliminary injunction. Those legal arguments are: (1) Plaintiffs will suffer an irreparable injury only if they prevail on the merits and Plaintiffs are likely to lose on the merits and (2) Plaintiffs' injuries \"are inherent in the temporary nature of TPS status\" -\n    <em>\n     i.e.\n    </em>\n    , \"[a] TPS beneficiary is ... always subject to the same uncertainties and concerns that Plaintiffs allege here\" because the TPS program is inherently temporary in nature. Opp'n at 26. Neither of these arguments is persuasive.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-64\">\n    The government's first argument is problematic because it effectively makes the factor of likelihood of success on the merits dispositive. But likelihood of success on the merits is not the sole consideration at the preliminary injunction phase; rather, irreparable injury and the balance of hardships must also be taken into account. The government's position cannot be squared with the sliding scale test expressly endorsed by the Ninth Circuit -\n    <em>\n     i.e.\n    </em>\n    , that the balance of hardships defines the showing on the merits the plaintiff must make at the preliminary injunction stage. Instead, the government's argument assumes there is no merit to Plaintiffs' claims and thus no irreparable injury. But at this stage, the merits cannot be definitively resolved, as evident in this Court's order denying the motion to dismiss, its assessment of the merits below, and the District Court's decision in\n    <em>\n     Centro Presente v. United States Dep't of Homeland Sec.\n    </em>\n    , No. 18-10340,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12527247\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/332/393/\">\n     332 F.Supp.3d 393\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%203543535\">\n     2018 WL 3543535\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20U.S.%20Dist.%20LEXIS%20122509\">\n     2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 122509\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (D. Mass. July 23, 2018) (in similar TPS case, largely denying government's motion to dismiss). At bottom, the government's argument ignores the fact that \"[a] preliminary injunction ... is not a preliminary adjudication on the merits but rather a device for preserving the status quo and preventing the irreparable loss of rights before judgment.\"\n    <em>\n     Sierra On-Line\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"654436\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/739/1415/#p1422\">\n     739 F.2d at 1422\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-65\">\n    The government's second argument fares no better. Although the TPS program is temporary in nature, that does not mean that Plaintiffs' injuries claimed herein are the purely result of the temporary nature of the program as opposed to the government's actions. For example, if (as Plaintiffs argue) the government were to follow the APA's procedural requirements as Plaintiffs contend is mandated by law, then, at the very least, TPS beneficiaries would have additional time in the United States to,\n    <em>\n     e.g.\n    </em>\n    , work, wrap up their affairs in the United States, and prepare for a return to their countries of origin. Although their stay is temporary in nature, the shortening of their time in the United States and acceleration of their removal if relief is not granted may constitute irreparable injury. There is also the possibility that were DHS to apply properly the requisites of the APA in assessing the TPS designation at issue, and to do so free of any Equal Protection taint, the Secretary might determine the extension(s) of TPS status for one or more of the affected countries is justified.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-66\">\n    Balanced against Plaintiffs' injuries if a preliminary injunction were not to issue are the government's injuries if a preliminary injunction were to issue. As an initial matter, the Court notes that the\n    government cannot argue in good faith that the continued presence of TPS beneficiaries in the country pending a final adjudication of the merits causes any concrete harm to the United States. By and large, TPS beneficiaries have been in the United States for a significant number of years, and there is nothing in the record suggesting their continued presence until the merits of this case can be adjudicated threatens the national interest or,\n    <em>\n     e.g.\n    </em>\n    , national security. Rather, as amici have underscored and the government has not disputed, TPS beneficiaries are contributors to state and local communities.\n    <footnotemark>\n     5\n    </footnotemark>\n    Moreover, the Court intends to expedite trial and final adjudication on the merits without delay, thereby minimizing any prejudice to the government.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-67\">\n    The government nevertheless protests that it and the public \"share an interest in ensuring that the process established by Congress - under which the Secretary of Homeland Security is vested with unreviewable discretion to carefully weigh the statutory factors governing TPS designations - is followed as Congress intended.\" Opp'n at 27. The government also states that \"the injunctive relief sought by Plaintiffs would frustrate and displace the DHS Secretary's substantive judgment as to how to implement the TPS statute.\" Opp'n at 27. But these arguments are lacking because they relate to jurisdictional issues upon which this Court has already ruled in denying the government's motion to dismiss -\n    <em>\n     e.g.\n    </em>\n    , the APA claim herein focuses on process only (not the actual substantive determination as to TPS status of each country), and thus judicial review is not barred. While the equal protection claim could impact the ultimate determination as to each country, it would do so not on the Secretary's factual findings about country condition which would be insulated from judicial review, but because of the influence of an overarching unconstitutional consideration that transcends each individual determination.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-68\">\n    Furthermore, the government's argument would apply to any public injunction enjoining the implementation or execution of any legislation or agency/executive policy. The risk of interference with governmental actions inheres in any public injunction, but that does not categorically bar such injunctions. While courts must exercise particular caution in issuing injunctions on matters that concern immigration given Congress and the President's extensive authority in this arena, it is beyond peradventure that governmental decision, even those that concern on immigration, are not immune from judicial review.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.,\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Zadvydas v. Davis\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9313599\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/533/678/#p682\">\n     533 U.S. 678\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 682,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9313599\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/533/678/#p682\">\n     121 S.Ct. 2491\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9313599\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/533/678/#p682\">\n     150 L.Ed.2d 653\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (2001) (with respect to \"aliens who were admitted to the United States but subsequently ordered removed,\" considering \"whether the post-removal-period statute authorizes the Attorney General to detain a removable alien indefinitely beyond the removal period or only for a period reasonably necessary to secure the alien's removal\") (emphasis added);\n    <em>\n     Osorio-Martinez v.

Any ultimate adjudication on the merits in their favor may come too late if they have been removed prior to final adjudication. Once the TPS beneficiaries are removed, the government's actions - if deemed unlawful in this lawsuit - could not practically be undone.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-70\">\n    Accordingly, the Court finds that, without a preliminary injunction, there is a strong likelihood that Plaintiffs would suffer irreparable injury, with concomitant harm to state and local communities as well. In addition, any harm to the government or the public if a preliminary injunction were issued is strongly outweighed by the harm to Plaintiffs and their communities should a preliminary injunction not issue.\n    <footnotemark>\n     6\n    </footnotemark>\n    The balance of hardships tips decidedly in Plaintiffs' favor.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-71\">\n    C.\n    <em>\n     Likelihood of Success on the Merits/Serious Questions Going to the Merits\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-72\">\n    The Court now turns to the issue of likelihood of success on the merits. Because Plaintiffs have established that the balance of hardships tips sharply in their favor, they need only show serious questions on the merits have been raised in order to obtain preliminary injunctive relief. Plaintiffs argue that they are likely to succeed, but, at the very least, there are serious questions going to the merits, on both their APA and Equal Protection claims. Each claim is addressed below.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-73\">\n    1.\n    <em>\n     APA Claim\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-74\">\n    The Court previously laid out the legal standard for Plaintiffs' APA claim in its order denying the government's motion to dismiss:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-75\">\n    Under the APA, agency action may be set aside if it is arbitrary or capricious.

The Court rejects the government's implicit suggestion because (1) the government has not formally moved for reconsideration of the Court's order on the motion to dismiss and (2) even if it had, it has made no showing that,\n    <em>\n     e.g.\n    </em>\n    , the Court manifestly failed \"to consider material facts or dispositive legal arguments which were presented to the Court before\" it ruled on the motion to dismiss.

Second, TPS beneficiaries clearly have a stake in whether their countries of origin maintain their TPS designations. A person cannot become a TPS beneficiary unless he or she is, in the first place, \"a national ... of a foreign state\" with a TPS designation.\n    <extracted-citation index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20244.2\">\n     8 C.F.R. \u00a7 244.2\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (a).

Part 244, which expressly apply to TPS beneficiaries.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20244.2\">\n     8 C.F.R. \u00a7 244.2\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (providing that \"an alien may in the discretion of the director be granted [TPS] if the alien establishes\" certain facts);\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20244.2\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    \u00a7 244.10 (providing,\n    <em>\n     inter alia\n    </em>\n    , that \"USCIS will grant temporary treatment benefits to the applicant if the applicant establishes prima facie eligibility for [TPS]\" and that, if TPS is denied, the alien may appeal). But the government offers no principled reason why the APA's procedural requirements attach to these regulations only. Even though these regulations deal with TPS beneficiaries specifically, that does not mean that TPS beneficiaries are not impacted by rules that relate to TPS designations more broadly, including the practices and policies at issue here. As noted above, broader rules on TPS designations\n    <em>\n     do\n    </em>\n    impact TPS beneficiaries since a TPS beneficiary's status is dependent on a TPS designation.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-88\">\n    The government protests that, even if Plaintiffs are allowed to challenge the process related to a TPS designation, they have still failed to show that there is any new policy or practice that would trigger the APA's procedural requirements (\n    <em>\n     i.e.\n    </em>\n    , an acknowledgment of the change in policy or practice and an explanation thereof). According to the government, there have simply been \"variations in how different Secretaries render their fact-intensive TPS determinations\" - \"at most a difference in emphasis rather than what could plausibly be considered a 'new rule.' \" Opp'n at 11. The Court disagrees. There is a wealth of record evidence to support Plaintiffs' position that the DHS changed its practices with regard to TPS designations - notably, evidence\n    <em>\n     beyond\n    </em>\n    a comparison of the Federal Register Notices on TPS designations before and after the Trump administration took over which this Court previously undertook.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Docket No. 55 (Order at 27-33) (noting,\n    <em>\n     inter alia\n    </em>\n    , that \"[p]rior to October 2017, extension and/or re-designation notices indicate that DHS consistently considered, at the very least, whether intervening events had frustrated or impeded recovery efforts from the originating conditions in Sudan, Haiti, Nicaragua, and El Salvador\"; in contrast, \"the termination notices for Sudan, Haiti, Nicaragua, and El Salvador [under the Trump administration] are curt and fail to address numerous conditions that justified extensions of TPS status in the most recent notices issued by\n    prior administrations\"). The comparative table set forth in this Court's prior order is relevant here.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Docket No. 55 (Order at 30-32).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-89\">\n    Since that order, Plaintiffs have developed additional evidence of a change in DHS process and policy. For example, Leon Rodriguez, a former USCIS director, testified that, both before and during his tenure at USCIS, there was no agency policy or practice that precluded \"consideration of the\n    <em>\n     full range\n    </em>\n    of current country conditions\" in assessing whether a TPS designation should be terminated or extended.

A responsive email from a career employee stated: \"We can comb through the country conditions to try to see what else there might be, but the basic problem is that it IS bad there [with respect to] all of the standard metrics.\n    <em>\n     Our strongest argument for termination, we thought, is just that it is not bad in a way clearly linked to the initial disasters prompting the designations.\n    </em>\n    We can work with RU to try to get more, and/or comb through the country conditions we have again looking for positive gems, but the conditions are what they are.\" Degen Decl., Ex. 2 (email) (emphasis added).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-108\">\n    The government makes much of the fact that Acting Secretary Duke - who made the TPS decisions on Haiti, Sudan, and Nicaragua - was given information about current conditions (and from many different sources),\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    Opp'n at 4-5; that Acting Secretary Duke was required to consider current conditions per the TPS statute (\n    <em>\n     e.g.\n    </em>\n    , in the case of an environmental disaster, to assess whether the country of origin could adequately handle the return of its nationals); and that Acting Secretary Duke did give current conditions weight as reflected by her November 2017 decision not to terminate Honduras's TPS designation and extend it for six months.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-109\">\n    However, the fact that Acting Secretary Duke\n    <em>\n     received\n    </em>\n    information regarding current conditions, does not prove she ultimately considered and relied on those conditions in deciding to terminate TPS status. The substantial record recited above strongly suggests she did not. As to the government's new claim that the Acting Secretary (or Secretary) was now\n    <em>\n     required\n    </em>\n    under TPS statute to consider country conditions other than the triggering condition, that assertion is belied by the record evidence above. It is also not supported by any reference by the Acting Secretary or Secretary to any document acknowledging any such requirement.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-110\">\n    As to Honduras, the Court notes that (1) Honduras was given only a brief extension of six months; (2) Honduras's TPS designation was eventually terminated; (3) whether a foreign country can adequately handle the return of its nationals is - at least arguably - a secondary issue, separate and distinct from whether the originating condition or conditions directly related thereto persist; (4) Acting Secretary Duke's November 2017 decision did not disavow the general approach that a TPS designation must ultimately be terminated if the existence of the originating condition or conditions directly related do not exist; and (5) Acting Secretary Duke seemed to endorse that approach, stating, in an email dated November 6, 2017, that her actions on Honduras were \"a strong break with past practice .... By not affirmatively extending, I'm stating that I'm not satisfied that the country conditions remain - but not yet sure how to best end TPS for this country.\" Degen Decl., Ex. 30 (email). Finally, regardless of what Acting Secretary Duke did with respect to Honduras, the fact remains that she did not grant any extension for Haiti, Sudan, and Nicaragua and that, as reflected in the Federal Register Notices related to the termination of those countries' TPS designations, termination largely turned on whether the originating condition or conditions directly related thereto persisted.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-111\">\n    Accordingly, the Court concludes that not only have Plaintiffs have shown serious questions going to the merits, they have demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits for their APA claim.

In particular, Plaintiffs have provided evidence indicating that (1) the DHS Acting Secretary or Secretary was influenced by President Trump and/or the White House in her TPS decision-making and (2) President Trump has expressed animus against non-white, non-European immigrants. As this Court noted, even if the DHS Secretary or Acting Secretary did not \"personally harbor animus ..., their actions may violate the equal protection guarantee if President Trump's alleged animus influenced or manipulated their decisionmaking process.\" Docket No. 55 (Order at 43).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-118\">\n    As to the first issue, Plaintiffs have pointed to several pieces of evidence suggesting that the White House was putting pressure on DHS to end TPS. For example, there is evidence that \"the White House was keenly interested in the [DHS] Secretary's decisions related to TPS,\" Degen Decl., Ex. 12 (Nealon Depo. at 89-90), and that Stephen Miller, \"an important [senior] adviser to the President and the White House,\" \"frequently\" reached out to Chad Wolf, the DHS Chief of Staff, about TPS, Degen Decl., Ex. 85 (Nealon Depo. at 288, 297, 300), as well as Gene Hamilton, the Senior Counselor to the DHS Secretary. On more than one occasion, Mr. Hamilton stated that \"Mr. Miller favored the termination of TPS.\" Degen Decl., Ex. 85 (Nealon Depo. at 292).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-119\">\n    As another example, shortly before Acting Secretary Duke was to make a decision on the TPS designations for Nicaragua, Honduras, and El Salvador, a White House Principals Meeting was held to discuss the TPS designations.\n    <footnotemark>\n     10\n    </footnotemark>\n    It appears that attendees included high-level White House officials such as Chief of Staff Kelly,\n    then-Principal Deputy Chief of Staff Nielsen, and Press Secretary Sanders. A memo distributed by the White House National Security Council in advance of the meeting recommended that the TPS designations be terminated and that Congress be engaged \"to pass a comprehensive immigration reform to include a merit based entry system.\" Degen Decl., Ex. 14 (NSC Memo at 2). The National Security Council recommendation to terminate TPS status was given to Acting Secretary Duke.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Degen Decl., Ex. 29 (Memo at 2). In addition, White House Chief of Staff Kelly subsequently had a conversation with Acting Secretary Duke about the TPS designations for the Central American countries.\n    <footnotemark>\n     11\n    </footnotemark>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Degen Decl., Ex. 30 (email).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-120\">\n    That the White House did, in fact, have influence on the TPS decisions is supported by the fact that, soon after the above, Acting Secretary Duke terminated the TPS designation for Nicaragua. Also, Acting Secretary Duke essentially indicated to White House Chief of Staff Kelly that Honduras's TPS designation would eventually be terminated as well, although she was not, at that point, formally terminating that country's status.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Degen Decl., Ex. 30 (email) (stating that, \"[b]y not affirmatively extending [Honduras's TPS designation], I'm stating that I'm not satisfied that the country conditions remain - but not yet sure how to best end TPS for this country\"; also stating that \"[t]hese decisions along with the public statements will send a clear signal that\n    <em>\n     TPS in general is coming to a close\n    </em>\n    \") (emphasis added).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-121\">\n    Notably, Acting Secretary Duke's writings suggest that she, in her role at DHS, was largely carrying out or conforming with a predetermined presidential agenda to end TPS. For example, in a November 2017 email to White House Chief of Staff Kelly, in which she reported on her decision to terminate for Nicaragua and temporarily extend for Honduras, Acting Secretary Duke stated that \"[t]hese decisions along with the public statements will send a clear signal that TPS in general is coming to a close.\n    <em>\n     I believe it is consistent with the President's position on immigration\n    </em>\n    ....\" Degen Decl., Ex. 30 (email) (emphasis added). She added: \"[T]his decision is really just a difference in strategy\n    <em>\n     to get to the President's objectives\n    </em>\n    .\" Degen Decl., Ex. 30 (email) (emphasis added). In a subsequent email to White House Chief of Staff Kelly, Acting Secretary Duke noted that Tom Bossert of the White House National Security Council had \"informed me of a strategy I was not previously aware of\" and she had now \"incorporated this new information into my final decision.\"\n    <footnotemark>\n     12\n    </footnotemark>\n    Degen Decl., Ex. 30 (email). In a draft memo regarding her TPS decisions, Acting Secretary Duke was equally direct:\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-122\">\n    \"The TPS program must end for these countries soon .... [\u00b6]\n    <em>\n     This conclusion is the result of an America first view of the TPS decision.\n    </em>\n    \" Degen Decl., Ex. 29 Memo at 1 (emphasis added).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-123\">\n    Because there is evidence that President Trump and/or the White House influenced the DHS on the TPS decisions to at least raise serious question on the merits, the remaining issue is whether there is evidence that President Trump harbors an animus against non-white, non-European aliens which influenced his (and thereby the Secretary's) decision to end the TPS designation. As Plaintiffs have catalogued, there is evidence of such as reflected by statements made by President Trump before, during, and after the TPS decision-making process\n    <footnotemark>\n     13\n    </footnotemark>\n    :\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-124\">\n    \u2022 In June 2015, Mr. Trump announced that he was running for President and delivered remarks characterizing Mexican immigrants as drug dealers or users, criminals, and rapists.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Degen Decl., Ex. 92 (Washington Post article).\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-125\">\n    \u2022 \"In December 2015, [Mr.] Trump called for 'a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States.' \" Degen Decl., Ex. 95 (New York Times article).\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-126\">\n    \u2022 In June 2017, President Trump stated that \"15,000 recent immigrants from Haiti 'all have AIDS' and that 40,000 Nigerians, once seeing the United States, would never 'go back to their huts' in Africa.\" Degen Decl., Ex. 95 (New York Times article).\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-127\">\n    \u2022 On January 11, 2018, during a meeting with lawmakers where immigrants from Haiti, El Salvador, and African countries were discussed, including with respect to TPS designations that had been terminated, President Trump asked: \" 'Why are we having all these people from shithole countries come here?'

The record evidence indicates that, after receiving Decision Memos from career DHS employees, higher-level DHS employees -\n    <em>\n     i.e.\n    </em>\n    , the political appointees - were \"repackaging\" the memos in order to get to the President/White House's desired result of terminating TPS. This was especially apparent with respect to the process on Sudan.\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-134\">\n    \u2022 On August 17, 2017, USCIS submitted a Decision Memo on Sudan to the Acting DHS Secretary. (The memo was signed by James McCament, the USCIS Deputy Director and then-Acting USCIS Director.) In the memo, USCIS noted that the State Department had submitted a draft package to the Secretary of State and that the draft package \"assesses that the statutory conditions supporting Sudan's TPS designation continue to be met and recommends an 18-month extension of Sudan's designation for TPS.\" Degen Decl., Ex. 40 (Decision Memo at 1). USCIS further indicated that, per its own country conditions report, \"the ongoing armed conflict and temporary conditions that supported Sudan's designation for TPS persist.\" Degen Decl., Ex. 40 (Decision Memo at 1). USCIS concluded the memo by listing the Acting Secretary's options -\n    <em>\n     i.e.\n    </em>\n    , extend, redesignate, or terminate. Although USCIS did not formally make a recommendation at that time, it did note, under the extend option, that \"[t]he review of conditions in Sudan indicates that\n    <em>\n     it remains unsafe for individuals to return to Sudan and that the statutory requirements to designate a country for TPS under Immigration and Nationalit Act \u00a7 244(b)(1)(A) (ongoing armed conflict) and under \u00a7 244(b)(1)(C) (extraordinary and temporary conditions) continue to be met\n    </em>\n    .\" Degen Decl., Ex. 40 (Decision Memo at 4) (emphasis added). Similarly, under the terminate option, USCIS stated: \"Because the conditions supporting Sudan's TPS designation persist,\n    <em>\n     termination does not appear to be warranted\n    </em>\n    .\" Degen\n    Decl., Ex. 40 (Decision Memo at 5) (emphasis added).\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-135\">\n    \u2022 A week and a half later, on August 28, 2017, USCIS submitted a second Decision Memo on Sudan to the Acting DHS Secretary. In the memo, USCIS reiterated largely reiterated\n    <em>\n     all\n    </em>\n    of the above - but in spite of such, USCIS now made a formal recommendation that Sudan's TPS designation be terminated. Degen Decl., Ex. 41 (Decision Memo at 5).\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-136\">\n    \u2022 The very next day, August 29, 2018, Frank Cissna, who would later become the USCIS Director, sent an email noting that the Decision Memo \"seems a bit confused\" -\n    <em>\n     i.e.\n    </em>\n    , the extend and terminate options indicated that TPS should be extended but the recommendation came to the opposite conclusion. Degen Decl., Ex. 1 (email). Mr. Cissna added: \"\n    <em>\n     The memo reads like one person who strongly supports extending TPS for Sudan wrote everything up to the recommendation section, and then someone who opposes extension snuck up behind the first guy, clubbed him over the head, pushed his senseless body out of the way, and finished the memo.

How would like you us to proceed?\" Degen Decl., Ex. 48 (email). Mr. Hamilton's response was: \"We need to repackage.\" Degen Decl., Ex. 48 (email).\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-138\">\n    \u2022 On September 1, 2017, the Decision Memo was \"repackaged\" and included a recommendation to extend Sudan's TPS designation for six months.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Degen Decl., Ex. 27 (email and attachment). In the memo, USCIS noted that the Deputy Secretary of State recommended a six-month extension because \"the statutory conditions supporting Sudan's TPS designation continue to be met.\" Degen Decl., Ex. 27 (Decision Memo at 1). USCIS further noted that, per its own country conditions report, \"the ongoing armed conflict and extraordinary and temporary conditions that supported Sudan's designation for TPS persist.\" Degen Decl., Ex. 27 (Decision Memo at 2). Finally, USCIS made its own recommendation that a six-month extension be given because,\n    <em>\n     inter alia\n    </em>\n    , the Deputy Secretary of State had recommended such and because USCIS had \"assesse[d] the conditions related to the most recent designation continue to be met,\" that is, \"there is an ongoing armed conflict limited to certain parts of Sudan and extraordinary and temporary conditions continue to exist preventing nationals from returning in safety.\" Degen Decl., Ex. 27 (Decision Memo at 5). That recommendation, however, was apparently not satisfactory to Mr. Hamilton, the Senior Counselor to the DHS Acting Secretary. Thus, following a discussion with Mr. Hamilton, Mr. McCament, the Acting USCIS Director, prepared a new Decision Memo \"to clearly support the AS1 decision to terminate with a delayed effective date of 12 months.\" Degen Decl., Ex. 27 (email).\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-139\">\n    \u2022 In the new Decision Memo, USCIS acknowledged the recommendation of the Deputy Secretary of State (a\n    six-month extension) but now stated that its review of country conditions indicated that there was \"emerging progress and improvement in certain areas while noted challenges remain.\" Degen Decl., Ex. 87 (Decision Memo at 2). Ultimately, USCIS recommended that Sudan's TPS designation be terminated with a delayed effective date by twelve months. Included as support for the recommendation was the statement that \"[t]here is ongoing conflict in some regions, but not the entire country.\" Degen Decl., Ex. 87 (Decision Memo at 6). USCIS did not explain, however, whether it made an assessment of any kind as to whether some TPS beneficiaries would likely be returned to those unsafe areas where conflict persisted.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-140\">\n    \u2022 Subsequently, DHS took steps to prepare the Federal Register Notice for the termination. Following an edit of the notice by Mr. Hamilton (the Senior Counselor to the Acting DHS Secretary), a DHS career employee noted that, \"based on what we've seen to date, [the] State [Department] would likely object to the removal of human rights violations - pared down as the language already was - that was in there. For our part, we'd just say that this could be read as taking another step toward providing an incomplete and lopsided country conditions presentation to support termination, which may increase the likelihood of criticism from external stakeholders to that effect.\" Degen Decl., Ex. 5 (email).\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-141\">\n    \u2022 The DHS career employee rightly noted that the State Department would have concerns about the Federal Register Notice. The State Department stated that it believed there were \"some significant mischaracterizations that are at odds with the Department's understanding of circumstances on the ground.\" Degen Decl., Ex. 7 (email);\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    Degen Decl., Ex. 8 (email) (State Department again expressing concern about mischaracterizations and downplaying of the actual situation). Mr. Hamilton responded that, while DHS would work to accommodate some of the State Department's concerns, it would not do all, deeming many of the concerns as overblown and irrelevant to the legal determination for TPS designation.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Degen Decl., Ex. 9 (email).\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-142\">\n    The TPS decision-making for the other countries underwent a similar process. For example, for the decisions on Honduras, Nicaragua, and El Salvador, Ms. Kovarik, the Chief of OP &amp; S, complained that the Decision Memos \"read[ ] as though we'd recommend an extension b/c we talk so much about how bad it is, but there's not enough in there about positive steps that have been taken since its designation.\" Degen Decl., Ex. 2 (email). A career DHS employee responded:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-143\">\n    We can comb through the country conditions to try to see what else there might be, but the basis problem is that it IS bad wrt [with respect to] all of the standard metrics. Our strongest argument for termination, we thought, is just that it is not bad in a way clearly linked to the initial disasters prompting the designations. We can work with RU to try to get more, and/or comb through the country conditions we have again looking for positive gems, but the conditions are what they are\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-144\">\n    Degen Decl., Ex. 2 (email). After the career employee \"cleaned up [the Central American] TPS decisions memos,\" Degen Decl., Ex. 4 (email), Ms. Kovarik was still not satisfied with the repackaging, noting,\n    <em>\n     e.g.\n    </em>\n    , that \"disasters\" should be changed to \"challenges.\" Degen Decl., Ex. 4 (email).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-145\">\n    For Haiti, the same career employee submitted a Decision Memo \"written so that it could support either extension or termination, but left the recommendation blank, pending further discussion.\" Degen Decl., Ex. 3 (email). Robert Law, a Senior Adviser to Ms. Kovarik, still responded:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-146\">\n    The draft is overwhelming[ly] weighted for extension which I do not think is the conclusion we are looking for. The memo seems to dismiss or downlay the positive developments that should suggest reauthorization is inappropriate. The memo also makes no mention of the substantial amount of foreign aid the U.S. and charities have invested in Haiti since the earthquake[,] another relevant factor to indicate that Haiti no longer meets the definition of TPS.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-147\">\n    Degen Decl., Ex. 3 (email). Mr. Law then made edits to the Decision Memo: \"I made the document fully support termination and provided comment boxes where additional data should be provided to back up this decision.\" Degen Decl., Ex. 3.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-148\">\n    And in addition to the above \"repackaging,\" Acting Secretary Duke expressly acknowledged that the terminations of TPS designations were \"a strong break with past practice,\" Degen Decl., Ex. 30 (email) - designed to fit the President's objectives on immigration which would put \"America first.\"\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Degen Decl., Ex. 30 (email) (\"These decisions along with the public statements will send a clear signal that TPS in general is coming to a close.\n    <em>\n     I believe it is consistent with the President's position on immigration\n    </em>\n    ....\") (emphasis added); Degen Decl., Ex. 29 (memo) (\"The TPS program must end for these countries soon .... [\u00b6]\n    <em>\n     This conclusion is the result of an America first view of the TPS decision.\n    </em>\n    \") (emphasis added). This begs the question what \"America first\" means. Plaintiffs suggest this is a code word for removal of immigrants who are non-white and/or non-European. When the Court asked the government's counsel at the hearing what \"an America first view of the TPS decision\" meant, counsel was unable to provide a clear and direct response.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Docket No. 127 (Tr. at 69-70) (defense counsel arguing that Acting Secretary Duke was referring to \"migration and ... drug enforcement issues and a general kind of perspective\" and that she was \"grappling with the decision\" on what to do about TPS).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-149\">\n    Finally, as discussed above in the context of the APA claim, there were departures from the normal procedural sequence during the TPS decision-making process; that is, instead of considering all current country conditions as had been done in previous administrations, the DHS political appointees in the current administration made TPS decisions turn on whether the originating condition or conditions directly related thereto continued to exist, disregarding all other current conditions no matter how bad. Moreover, at the apparent behest of then-DHS Secretary Kelly, there was an effort to gather negative information about Haitian TPS beneficiaries prior to the decision on Haiti's TP designation - in particular, whether Haitian TPS beneficiaries had been convicted of crimes or were on public or private relief.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Degen Decl., Ex. 84 (email).

Those who have an independent status entitling them to stay in the U.S. are not likely to be registered under TPS status.

Plaintiffs filed their case in March 2018, which was only a few months after decisions were made on Haiti and El Salvador. While the decisions on Sudan and Nicaragua were made a little earlier, Plaintiffs' lawsuit was still filed well in advance of the actual termination dates.

As for foreign policy, although the State Department provided DHS with its evaluation of country of conditions and recommendations, and although Acting DHS Secretary did appear to consider foreign policy for at least the Central American TPS designations, ultimately, the decisions to terminate (or, for Honduras, temporarily extend but with the indication that termination would be forthcoming) were ultimately driven by the question of whether the originating condition or conditions directly related thereto continued to exist. Notably, the foreign policy considerations appeared to warrant extension,\n     <em>\n      not termination\n     </em>\n     , of TPS status of the affected countries. In short, the termination decisions were\n     <em>\n      not justified\n     </em>\n     by foreign policy considerations. In contrast to the travel ban at issue in\n     <em>\n      Trump v.
