INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Plaintiff Tom Rossley brings this suit against Defendants Drake University and Drake University Board of Trustees challenging his termination as a member of the University's Board of Trustees and contesting Drake's Title IX investigation of Rossley's son. Am. Compl., ECF No. 26. Defendants move for partial judgment on the pleadings as to Count I-alleging retaliation under Title IX-against Drake University. ECF No. 53. For the reasons set forth below, the Court determines Rossley has not pleaded he was subjected to discrimination under an education program or activity and therefore lacks statutory standing to bring a retaliation claim under Title IX. Consequently, the Court grants Defendants' motion for partial judgment on the pleadings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    II. FACTUAL &amp; PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Rossley served as a member of the Drake University Board of Trustees for twenty-three years. ECF No. 26 \u00b6 14. In the fall of 2015, Drake University commenced a Title IX\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   investigation into an allegation of sexual assault by Rossley's son.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 49. As relevant here, Rossley believed the investigation was unlawful and biased against his son due to his son's gender.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 30, 161. Rossley contacted Drake University's Dean of Students regarding his concerns.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 58, 65-69. In April 2016, Rossley wrote an email and sent a letter to Drake University's Dean of Students, the Board, and \"select members of Defendant Drake's faculty and administration\" expressing his concerns with the Title IX investigation of his son.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 87-95. In mid-July 2016, the Board voted to remove Rossley from the Board of Trustees.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 122, 127.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In February 2017, Rossley brought this suit. Compl., ECF No. 1. In July 2017, Rossley filed an Amended Complaint. ECF No. 26. Following the Court's December 20, 2017 Order on Defendants' Partial Motion to Dismiss, the following counts of the Amended Complaint remain: Count I (retaliation under Title IX against Defendant Drake University); Count II (breach of fiduciary duties against Defendant Board); Count III (breach of Drake's policies and procedures against both Defendants); and Count V (retaliation under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, and the Iowa Civil Rights Act against both Defendants).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 41 at 15-16.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On February 20, 2018, Defendants filed a motion for partial judgment on the pleadings pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(c). ECF No. 53. Defendants request the Court dismiss Count I against Drake University.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 6. Defendants assert Rossley lacks statutory standing because \"[a]s a non-student, Rossley cannot suffer the systemic denial of access to education programs and activities and [thus] is not within the zone of interests that Title IX is meant to protect.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 3-4. Rossley resists. ECF No. 54. Neither party requested a hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    III. LEGAL STANDARD\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Defendants' Rule 12(c) Motion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Before the Court considers the substance of Defendants' motion, the Court first addresses Rossley's argument that Defendants have waived their right to bring a motion under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure Rule 12(c). Rule 12(c) provides \"[a]fter the pleadings are closed-but early enough not to delay trial-a party may move for judgment on the pleadings.\" \"A grant of judgment on the pleadings is appropriate 'where no material issue of fact remains to be resolved and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.' \"\n   <em>\n    Poehl v.

Ark. June 18, 2010) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 54 at 4-6 (discussing these cases). Rossley has pointed to no case law to support his proposition that a defendant waives its right to bring a Rule 12(c) motion by raising affirmative defenses or denying the plaintiff's factual allegations.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gallagher v.

R. Civ. P. 8(b)(1) (requiring a responding party to \"state in short and plain terms its defenses to each claim\" and \"admit or deny the allegations asserted against it by an opposing party\"). This Rule would be undermined if a responding party had to choose between raising affirmative defenses and filing a motion under Rule 12(c). This is especially true as Rule 12(c) may only be brought\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   the pleadings are closed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ.

Specifically, Defendants assert Rossley lacks statutory standing and thus cannot pursue his claim for retaliation under Title IX. ECF No. 53 \u00b6 4. This is, in essence, an argument that Rossley has failed to assert a claim under which relief may be granted.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lexmark Int'l, Inc. v.

DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Defendants assert Rossley lacks statutory standing to bring a retaliation claim under Title IX, as he has not alleged he was denied access to an education program or activity. ECF No. 53 \u00b6\u00b6 2-4. Rossley contends a Title IX retaliation plaintiff is not required to assert he was denied such access. ECF No. 54 at 6-8. Alternatively, Rossley argues he has sufficiently pleaded he was denied access to an education program or activity.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The Court will first analyze the requirement that a plaintiff have statutory standing. The Court will then examine the scope of a plaintiff's cause of action for retaliation under Title IX. Finally, the Court will consider whether, under Title IX, Rossley has pleaded a plausible retaliation claim. For the reasons set forth below, the Court determines a Title IX retaliation plaintiff must allege facts showing he was either an employee or was otherwise excluded from participation in, denied the benefits of, or subjected to discrimination under an education program or activity. The Court finds Rossley was not an employee and has not pleaded he was excluded from participation in, denied the benefits of, or subjected to discrimination under an education program or activity. Therefore, Rossley lacks statutory standing to bring a retaliation claim under Title IX and the Court grants Defendants' motion for partial judgment on the pleadings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

For the reasons set forth below, the Court determines in order to assert a claim of retaliation under Title IX, an individual must plead facts showing the alleged retaliatory conduct subjected him to discrimination under an education program or activity.

Any retaliation the employee experienced pertained to his position under an education program or activity, and thus was the type of action prohibited by the plain language of Title IX.

Additionally, based on the allegations in Rossley's Amended Complaint, the Board's activities do not include any of the hallmarks of an education program or activity: it does not permit individuals participating in the Board to earn a degree and it does not accept tuition, offer accreditation, or provide an \"incrementally structured\" course of study to the Trustees.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mercy Catholic Med.

Even if the Board did provide education programs or activities to students, Rossley has not plausibly alleged he, as a Trustee, was denied access to or participation in those programs or activities. Thus, even assuming Rossley was denied access to the Board and ultimately removed from his position as a Trustee, he was not subjected to discrimination \"under any education program or activity.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Rossley also asserts members of the Board told him \"he had to 'stop this (meaning his complaints) immediately' and instructed that he needed to stop sending emails and talking to people, on the Defendant Board and off, about what Defendants had done to his disabled son.\" ECF No. 26 \u00b6 100.
