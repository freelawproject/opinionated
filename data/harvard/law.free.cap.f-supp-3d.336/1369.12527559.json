The Court, having reviewed the filings, and being otherwise advised in the premises, concludes that Plaintiff's Renewed Motion for Class Certification and Appointment of Class Counsel should be granted, and Defendant's Motion to Dismiss or Motion to Dismiss and Compel Arbitration should be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In this original lawsuit, Ronnie Dickens sued GC Services Limited Partnership (\"Defendant\") for violations of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (\"FDCPA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201692\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1692\n   </extracted-citation>\n   - 1692p. He alleged that Defendant failed to notify him and other similarly situated debtors that if they disputed their debt, they would have to notify Defendant\n   <em>\n    in writing\n   </em>\n   to trigger Defendant's legal obligation to verify the debt. (Dkt. 1, p. 2). By failing to specify that certain rights must be exercised in writing, Ronnie Dickens argued, Defendant failed to comply with the FDCPA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On November 14, 2016, the Court granted partial summary judgment on the issue of liability in favor of Ronnie Dickens and against Defendant. The Court denied Ronnie Dickens' motion for class certification after concluding that he did not meet the adequacy and superiority elements of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23. The Court also awarded him damages. Ronnie Dickens appealed. The Eleventh Circuit vacated and remanded portions of the Court's Order, specifically the denial of class certification and the award of damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On October 20, 2017, Defendant filed a suggestion of death reporting that Ronnie Dickens had passed away. Terri Dickens, Ronnie Dickens' widow, filed an unopposed motion to substitute herself as named plaintiff in the case, on behalf of the estate of Ronnie Dickens. The Court granted her motion after concluding that Ronnie Dickens' FDCPA claims did not extinguish with his death. Terri Dickens (\"Plaintiff\") filed a renewed motion for class certification and Defendant filed a motion to dismiss or compel arbitration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     STANDARD FOR CLASS CERTIFICATION\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   A district court is vested with broad discretion in determining whether to certify a class.\n   <em>\n    Washington v.

To the extent that Defendant and some of these courts interpret\n   <em>\n    Church\n   </em>\n   as providing an automatic injury, and thus standing, whenever a plaintiff allegedly suffers a procedural violation, this is not the case. The Eleventh Circuit distinguished Church's allegations from the allegations of \"a bare procedural violation\" in\n   <em>\n    Spokeo\n   </em>\n   by explaining that \"Church has not alleged a procedural violation.
