He was sentenced to 8 months incarceration. As a result of his conviction, he was required to register as a sex offender pursuant to the Kansas Offender Registration Act (\"KORA\"). K.S.A. 22-4902(b)(5). Under K.S.A. 21-4906(a)(1)(A), Plaintiff is required to register for 15 years from the date of his release from confinement. The KORA online registry site gives an \"end of registration\" date of\n   December 19, 2029. Plaintiff completed his incarceration, then apparently failed to register for some period of time after his release. Kansas court records show that Mr. Fulbright has been charged with a violation of K.S.A. 22.4903(c)(1)(A), for failing to register and remains in custody awaiting trial.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   online records for Shawnee County District Court, Case No. 2017-CR-000320 and Case No. 2017-CR-001194.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff filed this complaint on August 15, 2018, and has filed ten (10) other actions against various defendants with essentially the same allegations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Mr. Fulbright has completed his 8-month sentence for the 2014 conviction that he challenges here and is no longer incarcerated under that conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   However, Mr. Fulbright might argue that he remains \"in custody\" pursuant to the 2014 conviction because he is subject to the registration requirement and other restrictions imposed by KORA until 2029 as a result of that conviction. A petitioner may be found to be \"in custody\" for purposes of the habeas corpus act in situations where the petitioner is not physically incarcerated. The custody requirement can be met where there is a severe restraint on a person's liberty imposed because of the individual's criminal conviction.\n   <em>\n    Hensley v. Mun.

A COA may issue only if the petitioner made a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202253\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(2). \"When the district court denies a habeas petition on procedural grounds without reaching the prisoner's underlying constitutional claim, a COA should issue when the prisoner shows, at least, that jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the petition states a valid claim of the denial of a constitutional right and that jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the district court was correct in its procedural ruling.\"\n   <em>\n    Slack v.
