The Court has reviewed Defendants S.M.R. Jewell, Bureau of Land Management (\"BLM\"), and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's (\"FWS\") (collectively, \"Federal Defendants\") response (ECF No. 187) as well as Plaintiffs' reply (ECF No. 190). For the following reasons, the Court grants Plaintiffs' Motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    II. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   This case involved the proposed construction of a wind turbine farm-the Searchlight Wind Energy Project (\"Project\")-in Searchlight, Nevada, on federal public land managed by BLM. (ECF No. 90 at 2-3.) As part of the Project, BLM issued a Final Environmental Impact Statement (\"FEIS\") identifying the desert tortoise, sixteen bat species, and birds (including the golden eagle) as wildlife that would be affected by the Project. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4.) BLM consulted with FWS to ensure that the Project was not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of the desert tortoise, and FWS issued a Biological Opinion (\"BiOp\") concluding just that. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Based on the FEIS and BiOp, former Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar approved a Record of Decision (\"ROD\") authorizing two right-of-ways (\"ROWs\") for the Project. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiffs initiated this action pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act (\"APA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20701\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 701\n   </extracted-citation>\n   - 06. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5.) Plaintiffs alleged that Federal Defendants violated a number of laws in approving the ROD: the National Environmental Policy Act (\"NEPA\"), the Endangered Species Act (\"ESA\"), the Federal Land Policy and Management Act (\"FLPMA\"), the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act (\"BGEPA\"), and the Migratory Bird Treaty Act (\"MBTA\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In their First Amended Complaint, Plaintiffs asked the Court to \"[o]rder ... that the FEIS, BiOp and ROD violate the NEPA, ESA, FLPMA, BGEPA, and/or MBTA;\" to \"[r]everse, set aside, vacate, and remand the FEIS, BiOp and ROD;\" and to \"[e]nter temporary, preliminary, or permanent injunctive relief ... until Defendants have fully complied with law and BLM has prepared a new NEPA analysis or supplemented its current analysis in compliance with NEPA.\" (ECF No. 36 at 31-32.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiffs moved for summary judgment on their claims, and the Court granted the motion in part. (ECF No. 90 at 2.) The Court granted summary judgment in favor of Plaintiffs on their NEPA claim and ordered Federal Defendants to supplement the FEIS. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 18.) The Court did not consider Plaintiffs' claims for violation of the ESA, FLPMA, BGEPA, and MBTA in light of the Court's decision to remand the ROD, FEIS, and BiOp to Federal Defendants in connection with Plaintiffs' NEPA claim.

Desert Ass'n\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12270903\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/223/1147/#p1152\">\n    223 F.Supp.3d 1147\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In that case-which also involved a challenge to BLM's NEPA compliance under the APA -the fee demand was only $70,455 and the final award was $63,449.42.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12270903\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/223/1147/#p1152\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12270903\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/223/1147/#p1152\">\n    at 1155\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Plaintiffs counter that the fee demand in that case only accounted for a discrete, secondary phase\n   of the case after a separate ruling several years earlier on cross-motions for summary judgment, noting that fees for that portion of the case were settled separately. (ECF No. 190 at 14.) Taken together, the two phases of\n   <em>\n    Or. Nat. Desert Ass'n\n   </em>\n   consumed about 935 hours of attorney and law clerk time. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15 (citing ECF No. 192 at 2).) Plaintiffs request compensation for 1,156.2 hours of attorney time. (ECF No. 171 at 25.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   In light of Plaintiffs' explanation regarding the number of attorney and law clerk hours consumed in the comparator case,\n   <em>\n    Or. Nat. Desert Ass'n\n   </em>\n   , the Court finds Federal Defendants' first argument for reducing fees unpersuasive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Federal Defendants further argue that the fee demand is excessive because the case was overstaffed. (ECF No. 187 at 19.) Federal Defendants contend that the billing records show that the five lawyers working on this case spent an excessive amount of time conferencing and coordinating among themselves (68.9 hours). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 20.) Federal Defendants seek a ten percent across-the-board reduction to address the inefficiencies in staffing. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 21.) Plaintiffs counter that they have never engaged more than two environmental lawyers at the same time. (ECF No. 190 at 15.) In addition, Plaintiffs argue that the case Defendants cite in support of their argument (\n   <em>\n    Nat'l Council of La Raza v. Cegavske\n   </em>\n   , No. 3:12-cv-00316-MMD-VPC,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%202683683\">\n    2017 WL 2683683\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D. Nev. June 21, 2017) ) is distinguishable because that case involved attorneys from five firms working simultaneously. (\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%202683683\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The Court agrees with Plaintiffs that staffing two attorneys at a time to the case is not excessive and further agrees that\n   <em>\n    Nat'l Council of La Raza\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%202683683\">\n    2017 WL 2683683\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , is distinguishable for the reason Plaintiffs identified. In addition, the Court finds that the 68.9 hours Plaintiffs spent conferencing and coordinating among themselves over a period of six years is not excessive. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 190 at 15 n.9 (\"This case has stretched for six years ....\").) This figure would roughly correspond to monthly, one-hour conference calls, which would be a reasonable and perhaps conservative amount of conferencing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Federal Defendants further argue that Plaintiffs' billing records are full of vague descriptions and block billing, which make it impossible to determine whether the number of hours spent on any individual activity was reasonable. (ECF No. 187 at 21-22.) Federal Defendants seek a reduction of 10% to 30% of the fee award for the offending entries (but not an across-the-board reduction of all hours). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 22.) Plaintiffs argue that Federal Defendants have failed to specifically identify problematic entries but also submit time sheets that reduce several entries that Plaintiffs seem to concede are vague. (ECF No. 190 at 16.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Accordingly, the Court will accept Plaintiffs' billing records as amended to account for reductions where billing entries were vague or block billed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Success of Lawsuit\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   A litigant is eligible for an award under the EAJA if it is (1) a prevailing party (2) that incurred costs of litigation against the federal government and (3) meets applicable size or net worth criteria.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%202412\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2412\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(1)(A) &amp; (d)(2)(B).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Federal Defendants argue that Plaintiffs' fee award should be reduced by one-third to eliminate the hours they spent working on claims on which Plaintiffs did not prevail. (ECF No. 187 at 7, 22.) Specifically, Federal Defendants argue that Plaintiffs did not prevail on their claims under ESA, FLPMA, BGEPA, and MBTA because the Court did not reach the merits of those claims in its order granting summary\n   judgment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9.) The Court only ruled for Plaintiffs on their NEPA claim. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Plaintiffs argue that this Court's failure to reach certain grounds is not a sufficient reason for reducing a fee based on the Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Hensley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11298707\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/461/424/#p433\">\n    461 U.S. at 435\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11298707\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/461/424/#p433\">\n    103 S.Ct. 1933\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . (ECF No. 190 at 5.) Plaintiffs characterize their case as a complete success because the Court vacated all of the challenged decisions and the Project is defunct. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The Court agrees with Plaintiffs that the relief obtained in this case was not limited in comparison to the scope of the litigation as a whole-rather, the results achieved were identical to Plaintiffs' desired outcome. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 190 at 6 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Hensley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11298707\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/461/424/#p433\">\n    461 U.S. at 435, 440\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11298707\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/461/424/#p433\">\n    103 S.Ct. 1933\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).) Plaintiffs sought an order remanding the FEIS, BiOp, and ROD to the agencies (ECF No. 36 at 31), and they obtained judgment to that effect (ECF No. 90 at 18). Moreover, it is clear that each of Plaintiffs' claims were brought for the common purpose of preventing the Project from moving forward by remanding the FEIS, BiOp, and ROD to the agencies. Accordingly, the court finds that a reduction based on limited success is not warranted here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    V. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The Court notes that the parties made several arguments and cited to several cases not discussed above. The Court has reviewed these arguments and cases and determines that they do not warrant discussion as they do not affect the outcome of the motions before the Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   It is therefore ordered that Plaintiffs' motion and amended motion for attorneys' fees (ECF Nos. 153, 171) are granted. Plaintiffs are directed to file, within fifteen (15) days, a proposed order for the award of fees and costs to them in accordance with this Order and LR 7-2(f).\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-53\">\n    Plaintiffs filed an initial motion for attorneys' fees (ECF No. 153) to preserve their rights to seek fees, but the briefing on the motion was stayed pending disposition of two appeals.
