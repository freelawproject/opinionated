The state suit alleges that certain commentary and lobbying by plaintiffs constitute defamation, abuse of process, and tortious interference with contract. Presently before the Court is defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment.

Plts.' Resp. Statement Undisp. Facts \u00b6 1, Doc. No. 49 [hereinafter Undisp. Facts]. In \"approximately\" 2013, Campbell founded plaintiff Pennsylvanians for Union Reform (\"PFUR\"), a non-profit advocacy group that \"seeks to eliminate compulsory unionism in Pennsylvania while promoting\n   transparency and efficiency in government for taxpayers.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    \u00b6\u00b6 2, 4\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Campbell and PFUR conduct their advocacy work through a number of channels, including the filing of requests under Pennsylvania's Right to Know Law (\"RTKL requests\"), 65 Penn. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 67.101\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , lobbying government officials directly, and the maintenance of an official PFUR website at the URL www.paunionreform.org.\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    \u00b6\u00b6 3, 41, 94-95, 133, 164\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . At the times relevant to this case, Campbell also maintained a website at www.psbahorror.com, paid for with his personal funds. Jt. Stip. \u00b6 140.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Defendant Pennsylvania School Boards Association (\"PSBA\") is a non-profit association of public school boards, incorporated under the laws of Pennsylvania. Undisp. Facts \u00b6 4; Joint Stipulation Facts &amp; Evidence \u00b6 66, Doc. No. 50 [hereinafter Jt. Stip.]. The individual defendants in this case were the ten voting members of the Governing Board of PSBA (\"Board\") at all relevant times, including the time when the Board unanimously voted to authorize the state suit against plaintiffs. Undisp. Facts \u00b6 125. Seven of the individual defendants remain on the Board and collectively constitute a quorum of the Board, capable of discontinuing the state suit. Jt. Stip. \u00b6\u00b6 16-19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Structure of PSBA\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The structure and mission of PSBA and its relationship to the state are central to this case. As noted above, PSBA is an association of public school districts in Pennsylvania that \"exists to further the interests of public education and to provide assistance to public school entities that are members of PSBA.\" Jt. Stip. \u00b6 84. PSBA's membership consists entirely of \"public school districts, Intermediate Units, career and technical schools, state-supported colleges and universities, and such other statutorily-created public education entities\" (\"Public School Entities\"). Jt. Stip. \u00b6 69. The \"overwhelming majority\" of Pennsylvania public school districts are members of PSBA. Jt. Stip. \u00b6\u00b6 69. Membership in PSBA is expressly authorized by statute, 24 Penn. Conn. Stat. \u00a7 5-516, and Public School Entities may elect to join PSBA only \"pursuant to a vote of the entity's governing board\" at a public meeting. Jt. Stip. \u00b6\u00b6 70, 86, 90.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Once the governing board of a Public School Entity elects to join PSBA, the entity itself becomes a member of PSBA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Jt. Stip. \u00b6\u00b6 66, 86. \"Derivative membership\" is, in turn, \"bestowed\" on \"the elected or appointed directors of such entity and upon certain other officials of that entity.\" Jt. Stip. \u00b6 86. Votes for members of the Governing Board of PSBA are cast by each Public School Entity, as determined by \"a majority vote of each member entity taken at an official public meeting of such member entity.\" Jt. Stip. \u00b6 87. Other matters before PSBA's membership, including approval of its legislative platform, are voted on by an annual Delegate Assembly, comprised of delegates appointed by each member's respective governing board. Bylaws of the Pennsylvania School Boards Association, Inc. art. VIII, \u00a7\u00a7 1-2, 4 (Oct. 20, 2017), Exs. P-99, D-36. Delegates must be derivative members of PSBA-that is, school board officials or the non-voting secretary of a school board.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   art. VIII, \u00a7 2; art. I, \u00a7 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   PSBA's Board consists of ten voting directors, who \"must be elected, currently-serving members of the board of a member government entity that itself is a member in good standing of PSBA,\" along with one non-voting member. Jt. Stip. \u00b6 87. As noted above, the members of PSBA's Board are elected by votes cast by PSBA's Public School Entity members.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   With the exception of the President Elect, President, and Immediate Past President of the\n   Board, the eligibility of a derivate member to serve on the PSBA Board is \"contingent\" on the derivative member's continued service on the board of a Public School entity.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Without exception, all Board members' respective Public School Entities must continue to be members of PSBA in good standing.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    \u00b6 89\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Membership in PSBA\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   An entity's PSBA membership is contingent on payment of a membership fee-and approval of that payment by the entity's governing board-every year. Undisp. Facts. \u00b6 104; Jt. Stip. \u00b6\u00b6 90, 136. Membership in PSBA is voluntary and Public School Entities may withdraw at any time. Undisp. Facts \u00b6 19. The \"majority of PSBA's revenues\" derive from membership dues and fees \"paid for optional services and goods.\" Jt. Stip. \u00b6\u00b6 71, 105.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In exchange for membership fees, PSBA provides certain services to its members, including \"[l]egal advocacy in the name of PSBA on issues of statewide importance to public schools\" and \"[l]egislative advocacy for all public schools, other than charter schools.\" Undisp. Facts \u00b6\u00b6 102, 105;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Jt. Stip. \u00b6\u00b6 84-85. \"An essential component of PSBA's purpose is advocating the interests of public education in helping to shape law and education policy in front of the legislature, administrative agencies and the courts. PSBA's judicial advocacy is one of the benefits that PSBA provides to its government entity members for the price of such entities' membership.\" Jt. Stip. \u00b6 85\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In addition to its judicial and legislative advocacy, PSBA provides its members with a number of publications, a searchable grant database, \"legal links and resources,\" webinars, access to online training, and access to a \"Career Gateway job posting site.\" Undisp. Facts \u00b6 105. PSBA also provides its members with \"assistance in the development of school policies,\" \"personnel recruiting assistance,\" and assistance in employee relations. Jt. Stip. \u00b6 77. Additional services are available to members for additional fees, including executive search services, \"[b]oard policy services,\" and a \"School Law and arbitration newsletter.\" Undisp. Facts \u00b6 106.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Plaintiffs' Underlying Activities\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   PSBA's mission and relationship with Pennsylvania public schools were the focus of plaintiffs' activity beginning in March 2017, when plaintiffs sent an RTKL request to \"most, if not all, public school agencies\" in the state. Undisp. Facts \u00b6 136. In the request, plaintiffs sought,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , the contact information for certain school district employees and for the representatives of public employee unions. Verif. Compl. ex. 1. On March 28, 2017, PSBA staff attorney Emily Leader sent an email to the Public School Entity members of PSBA regarding plaintiffs' RTKL request. Undisp. Facts \u00b6 138; Verif. Compl. ex. 1. In the email, Leader advised the PSBA members to provide certain information such as publicly available contact information for receiving RTKL requests, the names of union presidents, and copies of collective bargaining agreements. Verif. Compl. ex. 1. Leader concluded, however, that employee email addresses that were not publicly published were not public records subject to the Right to Know Law.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On April 14, 2017, another PSBA staff attorney, Stuart Knade, sent a follow-up email to the members of PSBA, providing further \"guidance\" in responding to the request. Undisp. Facts \u00b6 141; Jt. Stip. \u00b6 3; Verif. Compl. ex. 2. In the email, Knade advised PSBA's members,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , that the Right to Know Law required them to do no more than make the requested documents\n   \"available for pick up at the district offices.\" Verif. Compl. ex. 2 at 5. Knade noted, however, that his assessment was contrary to \"early decisions\" by Pennsylvania's Office of Open Records and that \"anyone choosing to take [this] position ... must be prepared to litigate this through at least the Commonwealth Court and possibly the Pennsylvania Supreme Court.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Knade also noted that the production of certain information was subject to a balancing test articulated by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court to protect the privacy interests of public employees.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On April 25, 2017, Michael Levin, outside general counsel for PSBA, provided plaintiffs with a copy of PSBA's 2014 federal tax return via email, pursuant to a separate federal records request filed by plaintiffs. Defs.' Resp. to Pls.' St. Suppl. Mat. Facts \u00b6 49, Doc. No. 56-1 [hereinafter Defs.' Resp.]. Campbell responded to Levin in a series of email on April 28, 2017, with other individuals copied, stating, in part, that Levin was serving in a \"conflict-riddled role\" because he served as counsel for both PSBA and some of its entity members.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    \u00b6\u00b6 50, 82\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; Ex. P-476, exs. A-B. Campbell also stated that PSBA \"has caused a disgraceful abuse of government resources by advising school solicitors that they may withhold their work email addresses under the RTKL,\" referring to Leader and Knade's earlier emails. Defs.' Resp. \u00b6 50; Ex. P-476, exs. A-B. Plaintiffs eventually posted copies of Leader and Knade's emails to PFUR's website on a page titled \"PSBA Horror.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Undisp. Facts \u00b6 165; Exs.

Each of the 600 RTKL requests contained twenty-seven separate \"items.\" Verif. Compl. ex. 5. A number of those items sought documents related to PSBA and its activities, including \"[e]xtracted computerized information\" detailing specific expenditures by PSBA. Verif. Compl. ex. 5, items 15-21. In addition to the requests regarding PSBA, the May 8, 2017, RTKL request stated, \"I call upon elected school officials to terminate the taxpayers forced relationship with PSBA. Revoke PSBA membership.... Stop making taxpayers fund the salaries and ... pensions of a private corporation's employees.\" Undisp. Facts \u00b6 144. The request also included a link to a thirty-three minute video of Campbell, \"ostensibly to aid school districts and their solicitors in responding to his requests.\" Undisp. Facts \u00b6 147.

Levin advised the Public School Entities to produce some of the requested information such as evidence that the entity \"is not a member\" of PSBA, while other information was subject to a balancing test to protect the privacy interests of public employees. Ex. P-44 at 6-7. Levin further advised its members that it would not respond to plaintiffs' requests for \"[e]xtracted computerized information\" because its services were not \"nonancillary core governmental functions\" as required by the RTKL.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    at 12\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . PSBA ultimately declined to provide those documents. Undisp.

Resp. \u00b6 67. In response, plaintiffs\n   posted a photo of PSBA Executive Director Nathan Mains to the paunionreform.org website on a page titled \"PSBA Horror\" with a word bubble stating, \"Taxpayers, thanks for the $226,000 and the public pension! Now * * * * off, and drive to the school district if you want public records. And don't forget your check book.\" Jt. Stip. \u00b6 120; Exs. P-103-A, P-519 (alterations in original).

In its letter, however, PennDOT denied plaintiffs' request on the ground that PennDOT had its own \"statutory and regulatory scheme for\" obtaining \"motor vehicles records.\" Ex. P-458 at 2. The record does not reveal whether PSBA employees were exempted from payment of registration fees. Undisp. Facts \u00b6\u00b6 120-21.

In that same Order, the Court directed the parties to conduct discovery in two phases; phase one was to \"cover all discovery related to injunctive relief\" and was to be complete by June 1, 2018.

DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   In their Motion for Summary Judgment, defendants raise five arguments: (1) the conduct of PSBA and the individual defendants does not constitute state action; (2) plaintiffs' activity is not protected by the First Amendment; (3) the state suit is immunized under the First Amendment by the\n   <em>\n    Noerr\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    -\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pennington\n   </em>\n   doctrine; (4) the individual defendants are shielded by qualified immunity; and (5) plaintiffs have not adduced evidence to support the imposition of punitive damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Defendants' arguments present several interrelated constitutional issues under the First Amendment. In particular, defendants argue that the filing of the state suit is protected by the First Amendment right to petition under the\n   <em>\n    Noerr\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    -\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pennington\n   </em>\n   doctrine. Significantly, however, that suit seeks to impose liability on plaintiffs for petitioning and exercise of free expression. The Court concludes that although plaintiffs' activities are protected by the First Amendment, they have not carried their burden to show that defendants' filing of the state suit is not. Consequently, the Court cannot grant plaintiffs the relief they seek. Because those two issues are dispositive of the case, the Court does not reach the parties' contentions with respect to state action, qualified immunity, or punitive damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Plaintiffs' Activities Are Protected by the First Amendment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Defendants argue that plaintiffs have not proven that their petitioning and commentary were protected by the First Amendment, as required for their First Amendment retaliation claim.

Speech in a limited forum, however, is not automatically removed from the other protections of the First Amendment merely because the speaker violated the restrictions placed on that forum. Plaintiffs' alleged violations of those restrictions do not, in themselves, strip plaintiffs' speech or petitioning of its First Amendment protection and open the door for suits by third parties such as PSBA. Even if plaintiffs' speech were in a limited public forum, defendants would still need to show that plaintiffs' speech was actionable defamation or sham petitioning to remove it from the protections of the First Amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Third, defendants fail to show that any threats made by plaintiffs are outside the protection of the First Amendment. Mere threats, without more, are still speech and still protected by the First Amendment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Virginia v.

Plaintiffs' statements that they would appeal the denial of their RTKL requests-the only \"threat\" identified in defendants' Motion, Doc.

In reaching that decision, the\n   <em>\n    AbbVie\n   </em>\n   court determined that plaintiffs were required to meet a higher burden of proof in establishing subjective baselessness-showing \"by clear and convincing evidence that defendants had actual knowledge\" that their challenged petitioning was \"baseless.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 121, at *14.

No. 68 at 6 (quoting Faccinetto Dep. 78:1-9, Ex. P-511). Likewise, in the Complaint filed in the state suit, defendants alleged that plaintiffs' lobbying and commentary constituted \"unrelenting harassment of PSBA [and] its members\" and were intended to \"cause PSBA's 600 plus member entities considerable cost and inconvenience.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11789\" index=\"135\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/508/49/#p56\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting Ex.

No. 68 at 10. In particular, plaintiffs contend that allegations in the state Complaint that Campbell sent PSBA attorney Emily Leader a link to private videos of her family members in order to threaten her were inaccurate. Doc. No. 68 at 11 (citing P-473 \u00b6\u00b6 26-28). According to plaintiffs, the link erroneously directed Leader to her private videos-a result Campbell did not intend-and defendants did not correct the inaccuracies despite having have opportunity to do so in the Amended Complaint. Further, plaintiffs contend that the Amended Complaint sought to punish plaintiffs for their conduct following the filing of the state Complaint, \"including Campbell's petitioning to PSBA's membership to repudiate the State Tort Action itself.\" Doc. No. 68 at 15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Plaintiffs also argue with respect to defendants' pursuit of the state suit that defendants' issuance of a litigation hold notice in the state for documents \"dating back to 2010-7 years before [the] alleged abuse and defamation\" and efforts to serve Campbell by publication are \"consistent with the objective of using the [state suit] as a weapon.\" Doc. No. 68 at 12-13. According to plaintiffs, this conduct in pursuing the state suit shows that suit was filed solely as a weapon to chill plaintiffs' speech.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Finally, plaintiffs contend in their third argument that, because defendants \"hired a firm well known for bringing defamation claims\" and pursued the state suit \"despite every red flag and opportunity to stop,\" the Court should infer that the state suit was subjectively baseless. Doc. No. 68 at 16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   The Court rejects each of plaintiffs' arguments on this issue for the following reasons:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   First, as defendants point out, defendants' statements regarding the purpose of the state suit \"have nothing to do with PSBA's intent in filing\" that suit, but simply state \"what a defamation suit is all about.\" Doc. No. 71 at 17, 20-21. \"Under the\n   <em>\n    Noerr\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    -\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pennington\n   </em>\n   doctrine, it does not matter what factors fuel [a] citizen's desire to petition government,\" as long as the citizen subjectively intended to prevail on the merits of his or her petition.\n   <em>\n    Barnes Found. v.

Pa. 1996). The statements cited by plaintiffs do not address whether defendants subjectively intended to prevail on the merits in the state suit, but only defendants' stated reason for filing that suit-that is, \"vindicating\" the interests of the members of PSBA. That is irrelevant for purposes of\n   <em>\n    Noerr\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    -\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pennington\n   </em>\n   and does not establish that defendants intended to use the \"governmental process[,] as opposed to the outcome of that process,\" as a \"weapon.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Second, the Court rejects plaintiffs' argument that defendants' manner of pursuing the state suit is evidence of that suit's subjective baselessness. The purported inaccuracies in the state suit regarding the link sent to Leader are insufficient to establish that the state suit was subjectively baseless. Doc. No. 71 at 24;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Complaint, Ex. D-473 \u00b6\u00b6 26-28; Amended Complaint, Ex. 476 \u00b6\u00b6 38-40. Leader herself subjectively believed that plaintiffs had sent the video in order to \"creep [her] out and upset [her] daughter and [her].\" Ex. P-518 70:5-10. Further, those allegations are directly related to and add context to plaintiffs' alleged harassment of PSBA and its employees. Consequently, the inclusion of those allegations-accurate or not-is evidence that defendants sought to bolster their claims and does not establish that they were \"indifferent to the outcome on the merits.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Furthermore, plaintiffs' argument that the \"only 'new' allegations in the Amended Complaint pertained to Plaintiffs' RTKL requests and complaints about PSBA made after PSBA filed the State Tort Action-including Campbell's petitioning to PSBA's membership to repudiate the State Tort Action itself,\" Doc. No. 68 at 15-16, is unavailing. As an initial matter, it is entirely appropriate for a plaintiff to amend its complaint to add allegations of conduct that occurred after the filing of the initial complaint.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a), (d). Further, the allegations added in the Amended Complaint do not pertain to plaintiffs' RTKL requests or the lobbying of school districts to \"repudiate\" the state suit. Instead, the new allegations address the parodies posted to Campbell's personal website and plaintiffs' statements that Levin was serving in a \"conflict-riddled role.\" Amended State Complaint, Ex. 476, \u00b6\u00b6 24-30, 46-49. Those allegations are directly related to defendants' claims and their addition is evidence that defendants sought to prevail on the merits in the state suit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   The Court also rejects plaintiffs' arguments regarding the litigation hold notice and service by publication-those facts are simply irrelevant to the ultimate issue of whether defendants subjectively intended to prevail on the merits of the state suit. Without more, the Court declines to infer that defendants' use of the tools of litigation is evidence of their indifference to the merits of that litigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Further, the record shows that plaintiffs' lobbying campaign continued well after the filing of the Complaint in the state suit.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 71 at 58-64. Defendants excluded much of this conduct from the Amended Complaint. Had the state suit been filed solely to harass or embarrass plaintiffs, defendants could have included this conduct in the Amended Complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   Defendants' decision to exclude that conduct from the Amended Complaint is evidence that the suit was tailored to focus on conduct defendants subjectively believed to be actionable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   Finally, the Court rejects plaintiffs' third argument, that defendants' selection of \"a firm well known for bringing defamation claims\" and pursuit of the state suit \"despite every red flag and opportunity to stop\" is evidence that the state suit was subjectively baseless. Doc. No. 68 at 16. In their argument, plaintiffs rely on the decision in\n   <em>\n    FTC v. AbbVie Inc.\n   </em>\n   , No. 14-5151,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12527064\" index=\"137\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/329/98/#p125\">\n    329 F.Supp.3d at 125-27\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"138\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%203830533\">\n    2018 WL 3830533\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *19. In\n   <em>\n    AbbVie\n   </em>\n   , the court concluded that because \"all of the decision-makers\" who decided to file \"objectively baseless [patent] infringement lawsuits\" were \"very experienced patent attorneys,\" it was reasonable to conclude that they acted with the subjective intent to \"file sham lawsuits.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   The\n   <em>\n    AbbVie\n   </em>\n   court emphasized that the individuals \"who made the decision on behalf of AbbVie on whether to file the objectively baseless lawsuits ... were four experienced patent attorneys.... The record reflects that no business executives were in any way involved-not even with a perfunctory sign-off.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 124, at *17. In this case, the record shows that the key-if not exclusive-decisionmakers were school board officials and the attorneys of PSBA; the record contains no evidence that any of those individuals were well versed in the First Amendment. Thus, on this issue,\n   <em>\n    AbbVie\n   </em>\n   is distinguishable. Further, the fact that defendants hired a firm well-known for its defamation work is evidence that defendants subjectively intended to prevail in the state suit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   Taking the record as a whole, no reasonable factfinder could conclude that plaintiffs have shown by clear and convincing evidence that the state suit was subjectively baseless.
