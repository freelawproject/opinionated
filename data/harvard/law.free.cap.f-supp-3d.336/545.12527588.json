HAZEL, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Every ten years, the Census Bureau takes on the herculean task of counting the entire population of the United States. The Census Bureau expends considerable resources on this task, presumably to ensure that the count is as accurate as possible because an accurate count is essential to ensure, among other things, equal representation-a hallmark of our Constitution. As the 2020 Census approaches, the Census Bureau continues to refine its plans and prepare for the next count. As a part of that refinement, earlier this year, the Census Bureau formally added a new question to the census questionnaire, one that asks respondents to indicate whether each household member is a citizen of the United States by birth or naturalization, or not a U.S. citizen. Nineteen individual residents of Texas, Arizona, Nevada, and Florida (collectively, \"Plaintiffs\")\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   allege that this question will dramatically depress census response rates in their local communities and disproportionally affect the overall accuracy of the population count. Plaintiffs seek to enjoin the Census Bureau from including the citizenship question in the 2020 Census and assert claims pursuant to the Census Clause of the United States Constitution (Count I) and the Administrative Procedure Act (\"APA\") (Count II).

For example, the 1830 Census asked whether individuals were \"foreigners not\n   nationalized.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7. The 1930 Census asked for the place of birth of all individuals and his or her parents, the year of immigration and naturalization for all foreign-born individuals, and whether he or she was able to speak English.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 59.

Most households received a short form questionnaire asking a minimum number of questions (\"short form\"), while a smaller number received a long-form questionnaire that included additional questions (\"long form\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   U.S. Census Bureau, Questionnaires, https://www.census.gov/history/www/through_the_decades/questionnaires/;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 17 \u00b6\u00b6 63, 75. In 1970, 20% of the population were asked to provide their birthplace, 15% were asked to provide their parents' birthplace, and 5% were asked whether the individual respondent, if foreign born, had been naturalized. Measuring America at 78. In the 1980-2000 Censuses, one in six households received the long form questionnaire and were asked whether they had been naturalized (1980) or whether they were citizens (1990, 2000).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 86, 91-92, 97. Following the 2000 Census, the Census Bureau stopped using the long form questionnaire. Instead, starting in 2005, the Census Bureau began collecting monthly demographic data, including citizenship and national origin information, through the American Community Survey (\"ACS\"). The ACS is sent to approximately one in thirty-eight households each year.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   U.S. Census Bureau, Archive of American Community Survey Questions, available at https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/methodology/questionnaire-archive.html;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 17 \u00b6 63.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Preparation for the 2020 Census\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On March 28, 2017, the Census Bureau submitted a report to Congress (the \"March 2017 Report\") indicating that the 2020 Census would ask respondents to answer questions on behalf of themselves and household members about their age, gender, race/ethnicity, and whether they owned or rented their residence. ECF No. 17 \u00b6\u00b6 72-73.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiffs allege that the March 2017 Report did not include citizenship-related questions because, according to the Census Bureau, doing so \"would depress response rates, particularly among certain historically undercounted groups, and would compromise the accuracy and completeness of the census count.\" ECF No. 17 \u00b6 74;\n   <em>\n    see also id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 76-81.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On March 26, 2018, Secretary Ross issued a memorandum setting forth his decision to include a citizenship question on the 2020 Census.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 88; ECF No. 1-2 (\"Ross Memorandum\"). Per the Ross Memorandum, the Secretary's decision was prompted by a December 12, 2017\n   request from the Department of Justice (\"DOJ\") to include the question so that DOJ could utilize census block level citizenship voting age population (\"CVAP\") data in order to better enforce Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act (\"VRA\"), which protects the voting rights of minority populations. ECF No. 1-2 at 1. According to the Ross Memorandum, the Census Bureau performed a comprehensive review of DOJ's request and found \"that the need for accurate citizenship data and the limited burden that the reinstatement of the citizenship question would impose outweigh fears about a potentially lower response rate.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Shortly thereafter, on March 29, 2018, the Census Bureau submitted its report to Congress in accordance with \u00a7 141(f)(2) (the \"March 2018 Report\") and indicated that the 2020 Census would include the citizenship question. ECF No. 17 \u00b6 102; ECF No. 1-3 at 12. On June 21, 2018, after Plaintiffs filed their Amended Complaint, the Secretary clarified statements made in the earlier Ross Memorandum and indicated that he began considering the citizenship question, \"which other senior Administration officials had previously raised,\" \"[s]oon after [his] appointment as Secretary of Commerce.\" ECF No. 26-1 (\"Ross Supplemental Memorandum\"). The Secretary clarified that he and his staff \"inquired whether the Department of Justice (DOJ) would support, and if so would request, inclusion of a citizenship question as consistent with and useful for enforcement of the Voting Rights Act.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Alleged Impact of the Citizenship Question\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that the Secretary's justification for adding the citizenship question is a pretext for its true aim-\"to press the 2020 Census into the service of [President Trump's] anti-immigration political agenda.\" ECF No. 17 \u00b6 82. Specifically, Plaintiffs allege that by January 31, 2017, the Trump Administration had prepared a draft Executive Order that, among other things, directed the Census Bureau to ask a citizenship question.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 83. Without any reference to the VRA, the Order justified the citizenship question as \"fulfill[ing] several campaign promises by aligning immigration policies with the national interest\" and addressing \"the flow of illegal entries and visa overstays\" and the \"unlawful employment of aliens.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Additionally, President Trump's re-election campaign acknowledged that \"President Trump [had] officially mandated that the 2020 United States Census ask people living in America whether or not they are citizens.\" ECF No. 17 \u00b6 89;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 87.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Plaintiffs further allege that the Ross Memorandum \"contained no evaluation of the asserted legal or statistical foundation for the DOJ request and no independent assessment by the Commerce Department or Census Bureau of the asserted governmental benefit of adding a citizenship question to the 2020 Census questionnaire.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 90. Plaintiffs contend that Secretary Ross' decision was deficient for a number of reasons: the Census Bureau previously concluded that the VRA did not require block-level CVAP data, and the ACS already provides DOJ with sufficient VRA-related data,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 91, 92; the Ross Memorandum failed to identify any post-March 2017 circumstances necessitating the question, \u00b6 93; the use of a citizenship question has not been well tested, \u00b6\u00b6 94, 95; and, by the Secretary's own explicit\n   admission, the Census Bureau did not know, and was unable to determine, the impact such a question would have on nonresponse rates and the potential undercounting of immigrants, \u00b6 98. Ultimately, Plaintiffs contend that Secretary Ross had no basis to find the citizenship question necessary to enforce the VRA or that the benefits of collecting citizenship data outweigh potential adverse effects on response rates.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 101 (quoting ECF No. 1-2 at 8).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Instead, Plaintiffs allege that compelling evidence, including evidence from the Census Bureau itself, makes clear that \"the inclusion of a citizenship question will result in a disproportionate undercount of persons belonging to or sharing a household with certain demographic groups, including immigrants, noncitizens, those with limited English proficiency, and individuals of Hispanic or Latino Origin\" (collectively, \"Undercount Groups\"). ECF No. 17 \u00b6 105.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Undercount Groups are more likely to be suspicious about the purpose of the decennial census and the government's use of census data than other population groups, a suspicion allegedly exacerbated by the current political environment.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 106, 108. As a result, the citizenship question is expected to \"reduce participation and depress response rates among the Undercount Groups.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 106;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 114 (alleging that since issuance of the Ross Memorandum, Defendant Jarmin has publicly acknowledged in Congressional testimony that the inclusion of the citizenship question may disproportionally affect the Undercount Groups).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Plaintiffs further allege that these depressed response rates will result in a disproportionate undercount in their local communities-areas of the country with a higher percentage of individuals belonging to Undercount Groups. ECF No. 17 \u00b6\u00b6 115-124. The disproportionate undercount will, in turn, reduce the number of congressional seats expected to be apportioned to Arizona, Florida, Texas, and Nevada,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 125, and affect the drawing of \"equal population\" intra-state legislative districts in Arizona, Florida, Texas, Nevada, and Maryland so as to over-populate Plaintiffs' districts and dilute their vote.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 126.

The \"Manner\" prong leaves the \"way of performing or executing\" that headcount to the Census Bureau's discretion. ECF No. 24-1 at 32. Therefore, Defendants contend that courts may review claims challenging the calculation methodology applied to raw census data but may not review pre-count information gathering functions, including the selection of census questions, because doing so implicates policy-based determinations requiring the balancing of factors such as cost, effectiveness, accuracy, and timing.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 30 (\"This case implicates only the ['Manner'] question because it does not involve whom to count, how to count them, or where to count them.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Defendants' interpretation of the Census Clause is unpersuasive. While one could certainly categorize the Supreme Court cases discussed above as \"calculation-methodology\" challenges, ECF No. 24-1 at 33 n.10, nothing in the Supreme Court's holdings suggests that courts can review the sufficiency of the \"actual Enumeration\" but not the \"Manner\" in which the count is conducted.

Arguably, that would imply that the use of a citizenship-related question over the past 200 years was unconstitutional. But the slope is not nearly as slippery as this argument claims it to be, given that plaintiffs' allegations give rise to notable exceptions between the claim herein and otherwise permissible inclusions of demographic questions on the decennial census. First, Plaintiffs do not allege that an undercount is merely possible, they allege that the Census Bureau disregarded evidence indicating that the citizenship question will actually lead to a disproportionate undercount of the Undercount Groups. Second, as alleged, the inclusion of other demographic questions has been well tested to ensure that there are no adverse impacts on response rates,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 17 \u00b6\u00b6 58-65-an action not taken by the Census Bureau here. Third, the Court is not aware of any prior demographic questions that would, allegedly, be viewed by a specific segment of the population as an attempt to further an administration's law enforcement objectives related to that population. While a nominal portion of the populace may be turned off by having to answer any demographic question, there is no reason to believe that their reluctance would disproportionally affect any specific demographic. For example, there is no basis to believe that as a result of questions requesting the identification of participants' gender, women in a particular state would be less likely to respond. A male respondent in Michigan would be no more or less likely to respond than a female respondent in New York. Thus, there\n   would be no disruption to distributive accuracy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Nor does the fact that this citizenship question was asked in the past foreclose Plaintiffs' claim. Here, it is alleged that the addition of the citizenship question in the\n   <em>\n    current\n   </em>\n   political climate will cause an undercount of a specific population that is concentrated in specific areas, thus disturbing the distributive accuracy of the 2020 Census. Apart from merely seeking to accomplish a task beyond counting the population, as a standard demographic question would permissibly do, it is alleged that, here, the citizenship question will actively hinder the census' primary purpose.

In March of 2018, Secretary Ross repeatedly stated publicly and privately that he was considering reinstating the citizenship question in response to a December 12, 2017 letter from DOJ requesting the reinstatement of the question to assist in the enforcement of the VRA. ECF No. 17 \u00b6 85. In addition to the Ross Memorandum, at a March 22, 2018 House Ways and Means Committee Hearing, Secretary Ross testified that the citizenship question was being considered because \"the Department of Justice ... initiated the request for inclusion of the citizenship question.\"\n   <em>\n    Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross testifies at March 22 House Ways and Means Committee Hearing\n   </em>\n   , C-SPAN (March 22, 2018), https://www.c-span.org/video/?c4736903/commerce-secretary-wilbur-ross-testifies-march-22-house-ways-means-committee-hearing (last accessed July 30, 2018).\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   Documents contained in the Administrative Record, including the supplemental materials provided by Defendants on July 25, 2018, paint a different picture, however, and arguably suggest that (1) the addition of the citizenship question was prompted by senior administration officials and Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach; and (2) the \"request\" from DOJ was in fact manufactured by senior Department of Commerce officials as a pretextual reason for reinstating the citizenship question.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR 763-64, 3699, 3710.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   The Court finds that Plaintiffs have made the requisite showing of bad faith on the part of Defendants. The Administrative Record suggests that the citizenship question was an answer in search of a problem. There is evidence indicating that the Secretary and other senior administration or campaign officials were determined to include the citizenship question in the 2020 Census and sought out DOJ to provide a legally-defensible reason to do so. All of this appears to be at odds with the Secretary's public explanation for his decision. Such conduct provides sufficient evidence of bad faith to warrant additional discovery, and the Court grants Plaintiffs' request that they be given the same discovery as has been ordered in the New York Cases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.
