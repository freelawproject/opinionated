Plaintiff claims that Lexington Gardens et al.

Code \u00a7 8-107(5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Blanca Martinez has been living in the apartment in question under federal Section 8 subsidies for over thirty years. She is severely mentally handicapped and cannot live alone. After the death of their mother, Thelma Martinez became Blanca's primary caretaker and requested that Lexington Gardens allow her to move into the apartment to care for her sister full time. Defendants have refused to allow Thelma to do so, largely on the ground that she has poor credit history and a housing court record. Plaintiff seeks a reasonable accommodation under federal, state, and local disability law to allow Thelma to live with and care for her sister. Discovery is now complete. Now before the Court are the parties' cross motions for summary judgment. The facts of the case are not disputed; the sole issue is whether Lexington Gardens failed to provide a reasonable accommodation. For the reasons stated on the record and supplemented herein, plaintiff's motion for summary judgment is granted; defendant's motion for summary judgment is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Blanca Martinez is a 58-year-old woman. She is intellectually and developmentally disabled and has been diagnosed with Cerebral Palsy. She is unable to care for herself and requires around-the-clock assistance with everyday tasks including cooking, eating, using the restroom, and dressing herself. Plaintiff's diagnosis is supported by numerous medical evaluations, and there is no genuine dispute about her condition, the care she requires, and the practical reality she cannot live alone.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff receives federal Section 8 housing benefits and has lived in the disputed apartment for over thirty years. Plaintiff's mother, Maria, was plaintiff's primary caretaker until her death in 2016. When their mother died, plaintiff's sister, Thelma, assumed the role of plaintiff's full-time caretaker. Although Blanca and Thelma apparently have other siblings, none is willing and able to care for plaintiff. Thelma applied for and was granted guardianship of plaintiff by the New York Surrogate's Court in 2017, and she manages virtually every aspect of plaintiff's life, including her finances and daily medical care. There is also no genuine dispute that defendants have been aware of plaintiff's disability for years. Blanca's condition was listed on the family's original housing application in 1984, and her status was noted on yearly Section 8 recertification paperwork filed by her mother. Plaintiff's disability\n   was also specifically raised at least four times during Thelma and her mother's attempts to have Thelma added to the family composition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Defendants began receiving requests to allow Thelma to move into the apartment as early as 2014, when Maria's heath began to fade and she became less able adequately to care for Blanca. At least five requests followed the first, including one from the New York City Human Resources Administration's Adult Protective Services.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl. Rule 56.1 Statement, ECF 56, at \u00b6 57;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Decl. of Christine Clarke, ECF 58, Ex. 16 (requesting that Thelma be allowed to move into the apartment \"because it would be in the overwhelmingly best interest of her sister Blanca\"). Defendants have denied every request. Although defendants' justification has shifted in this litigation, when pressed, defendants have principally cited Thelma's poor credit and rental history as the basis for the denial. Specifically, it appears that a prior landlord obtained a housing court judgment against Thelma in 2011, which was later converted into a civil judgment and subsequently vacated by the court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Despite defendants' refusal to grant an exception, when Maria's illness became severe in early 2016, Thelma moved into the apartment to care for Blanca. Maria died in March 2016 and, facing no viable alternatives to care for Blanca, Thelma remained in the apartment. In the months following their mother's death, Thelma paid plaintiff's monthly rent on time and without incident until October 2016, when defendants commenced eviction proceedings in New York Housing Court and refused to accept further payments. With eviction proceedings ongoing, plaintiff filed this case under the FHA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The parties also raise a handful of tangential issues that have arisen over the course of this litigation, none of which is material. First, defendants attempt to reframe the case by arguing that they have not received monthly rental payments from Blanca or Thelma since October 2016. But the record is clear that the only reason that rent has not been paid is because defendants commenced eviction proceedings and refused to accept further payments. The cited reason for the eviction-that Thelma was living in the apartment without authorization-collapses back into the central issue in the case: whether allowing Thelma to live with her sister is a reasonable accommodation under the statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Relatedly, defendants also claim that Thelma has failed in her responsibilities as Blanca's guardian because she has not filed Blanca's recertification paperwork with the Department of Housing and Urban Development (\"HUD\"), which must be refiled yearly to maintain Blanca's Section 8 housing benefits. This too is misleading.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Because she is disabled and unable to work, plaintiff receives federally funded Section 8 housing benefits. Section 8, also known as the Housing Choice Voucher program, is a federally funded program administered by HUD that provides low-income families with federal assistance to purchase rental housing on the private market.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1437f ;\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=24%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%205.601\">\n    24 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.601\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   The amount that a family is eligible to receive depends on the family's income and composition, but the subsidy typically equals the difference between the rent for the unit and 30% of the family's adjusted gross income.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=24%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%205.628\">\n    24 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.628\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Salute v.

Because the federal subsidy varies depending on the family's ability to pay, Lexington Gardens will receive the same rent whether Thelma is permitted to move into the unit or not.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1235627\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/136/293/#p296\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Deposition of R.

Defendants responded by letter, stating that \"[t]he Landlord will not process these documents are [sic] presented\" and instructing plaintiff to \"resubmit the package with only Blanca Martinez in the family composition.\" Decl. of Christine Clarke, ECF 58, Ex. 42. This, of course, put plaintiff and her sister in an impossible position. Either Thelma would have to leave her sister without the care she requires, or commit fraud by submitting an inaccurate family recertification form to HUD, causing HUD to incorrectly calculate the value of plaintiff's federal subsidy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=24%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20982.551\">\n    24 C.F.R. \u00a7 982.551\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(4) (\"Any information supplied by the family must be true and complete.\");\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=24%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20982.551\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 982.551(k) (\"The members of the family must not commit fraud, bribery or any other corrupt or criminal act in connection with the programs.\"). The record is clear that the delay in recertifying plaintiff's Section 8 benefits has been caused by defendants' obstruction and refusal to comply with federal discrimination law. In any event, this saga is secondary to the central question of the case, which turns on whether defendants denied plaintiff a reasonable accommodation. The recertification process is merely an offshoot of that underlying question.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

Blanca cannot live alone and requires around-the-clock care. Now that her parents have passed, she has no other family or friends willing and able to care for her.

Blanca suffers from Cerebral Palsy, cannot communicate verbally, and requires full-time care. There is no dispute that she cannot care for herself or live alone. Balanced against this reality is the cost of granting the accommodation and the hardship on defendants, neither of which withstands meaningful scrutiny.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   To support their refusal to grant the requested accommodation, defendants largely rely on Thelma's poor credit and rental history. This reason is spurious and, indeed, for the reasons previously discussed, may be only an inaccurate pretext. First, defendants concede that, under Section 8, Lexington Gardens will receive the same rent regardless of whether Thelma moves into the unit.\n   <em>\n    Salute\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1235627\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/136/293/#p296\">\n    136 F.3d at 296\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Second, because Thelma is responsible for managing Blanca's finances and social security payments, Thelma would be required to pay Blanca's rent regardless. Third, Thelma has paid monthly rent on time and without incident until defendants commenced eviction proceedings and refused to accept further payments. There is no concrete reason to believe that Thelma will be unable to make rental payments. Plaintiff's immediate, urgent medical condition and need for care make it reasonable that Thelma live in the apartment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Defendants also argue that its renter screening policies, which consider credit scores and rental history, were adopted \"pursuant to\" HUD guidance on\n   administering Section 8 properties.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Memorandum of Law, ECF 60, at 10. This too is misleading. Although HUD regulations and guidance allow landlords participating in Section 8 to screen applicants based on credit and rental history, that same guidance also instructs participating landlords that \"[a]ll screening criteria\" must be \"consistently applied to all applicants in a non-discriminatory fashion and in accordance with all applicable fair housing and civil rights laws.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   HUD Handbook Section 4350.3 \u00a7 4.7. More specifically, HUD's regulations and Occupancy Handbook instruct that participating owners must make reasonable accommodations \"in rules, policies, practices, or services, when such accommodations may be necessary to afford a handicapped person equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling unit.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=24%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20100.204\">\n    24 C.F.R. \u00a7 100.204\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   HUD Handbook Section 4350.3 \u00a7 2-5(C) (\"[A]n owner may have to modify rules, policies, practices, procedures and/or services to afford a person with a disability an equal opportunity to use and enjoy the housing.\"). Any suggestion that defendants' screening polices are\n   <em>\n    required\n   </em>\n   by federal law, regardless of a need for modification to afford equal opportunity to a disabled person, is simply incorrect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Boiled down, defendants' central argument is as follows: \"Blanca's request to have Thelma reside in the apartment [stet], is unreasonable because it would require Lexington Gardens to violate its own policies adopted pursuant to federal regulations, namely, its policy of denying tenancy to individuals with history of rent delinquency and poor credit.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Memorandum of Law, ECF 60, at 10. The problem, of course, is that requiring a landlord to \"violate its own policies\" is\n   <em>\n    precisely\n   </em>\n   what a reasonable accommodation may be and what federal law requires. The plain text of \u00a7 3604(f)(3)(B) requires landlords \"to make reasonable accommodations in\n   <em>\n    rules, policies, practices\n   </em>\n   , or services, when such accommodations may be necessary to afford such person equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203604\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3604\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (f)(3)(B) (emphasis added). As the Supreme Court has explained in the ADA context: \"[b]y definition any special 'accommodation' requires the employer to treat an employee with a disability differently,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , preferentially. And the fact that the difference in treatment violates an employer's disability-neutral rule cannot by itself place the accommodation beyond the Act's potential reach.\"\n   <em>\n    U.S. Airways, Inc. v.

Defendants' argument misstates Lexington Gardens' obligations under federal law, which expressly require deviations from neutral rules when necessary and reasonable under the circumstances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Defendants' other justifications fare not better. For instance, defendants claim that they learned through Thelma's deposition that she previously subleased an apartment without authorization. But such a sublease has no support in the record. Defendants claim also that Thelma moved into the apartment without authorization, thereby violating the terms of the lease. But Thelma did so only after their mother died, and only because her sister needed care. This merely reframes the central question in the case-whether plaintiff's requested accommodation is reasonable. Defendants also cite the fact that Thelma's wife and step-son moved into the apartment with her, but this too merely distracts from the central issue in the case. Defendants never raised any objection to Thelma's family moving in until after this litigation began, and the landlord previously allowed up to six people on the lease.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def. Rule 56.1 Statement, ECF 61, at \u00b6 17. In any event, Thelma's wife and step-son\n   moved out of the apartment in February 2018 and have no plans to return.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl. Rule 56.1 Statement, ECF 56, at \u00b6 13-14. None of these peripheral objections is compelling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Defendants also rely heavily on\n   <em>\n    Williams v.

Thelma claims that the housing court judgment stemmed from her withholding rent due to the unsafe conditions of an apartment in which she lived. After appearing unrepresented in housing court, the landlord agreed to waive any past-due rent if Thelma moved out by a certain date. Despite this resolution, the landlord then obtained a default judgment against Thelma in civil court, which was subsequently vacated and the case was discontinued. Defendants have not disputed this account, but the particular circumstances of Thelma's prior housing issues do not materially affect the outcome of this case. Even assuming that Thelma has a somewhat poor rental and credit history, and would therefore not typically be considered a desirable tenant for Lexington Gardens, the question remains: Is Lexington Gardens required to make an exception as a reasonable accommodation to Blanca's disability?

Under the\n    <em>\n     McDonnell-Douglas\n    </em>\n    framework, once a plaintiff establishes a prima facie case of discrimination, the burden shifts to the defendant to demonstrate a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for the decision.
