(Dkt. # 1). The Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20405\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff has moved (Dkt. # 9) and the Commissioner has cross moved (Dkt. # 13) for judgment on the pleadings pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(c). For the reasons that follow, the Commissioner's motion is granted, plaintiff's motion is\n   denied, and the Commissioner's decision is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On April 22, 2013, the plaintiff protectively applied for disability insurance benefits with the Social Security Administration (\"SSA\"). (Dkt. # 8 at 107). He alleged disability since December 20, 2012 due to hypertension, degenerative joint disease, Gilbert's disease (a liver disorder ), Type 2 diabetes, hyperlipidemia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (\"COPD\"), glucose intolerance, anxiety, depressive disorder, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea (nighttime attacks of severe shortness of breath), and lightheadedness. (Dkt. # 8 at 107).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiff's application was denied initially and upon reconsideration. Plaintiff requested a hearing, which was held July 24, 2015 before administrative law judge (\"ALJ\") Robert E. Gale. (Dkt. # 8 at 112-13, 106-07, 125, 141). On September 25, 2015, the ALJ issued a decision finding that the plaintiff was not disabled within the meaning of the Act. (Dkt. # 8 at 28). That decision became the final decision of the Commissioner when the Appeals Council denied review on December 19, 2016. (Dkt. # 8 at 1-4). This action followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

The ALJ's Decision\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The ALJ found that the Plaintiff suffers from the following severe impairments, not meeting or equaling a listed impairment: mild COPD with chronic bronchitis, and an intellectual disability. (Dkt. # 8 at 18-21). After reviewing the evidence of record, the ALJ determined that the Plaintiff retains the residual functional capacity (\"RFC\") to lift, carry, push, and pull 25 pounds occasionally and 10 pounds frequently, and can sit, stand and/or walk for up to six hours in an eight-hour workday. He should not use ladders, ropes, or scaffolds, but can frequently climb ramps and stairs. Plaintiff can reach in all directions with his left upper extremity to shoulder level, and can reach with his right upper extremity without any limitations. He has no limitations in handling, fingering, and feeling. He must avoid even moderate exposure to smoke, dust, pulmonary irritants, and extreme temperatures. He can understand, remember, perform, and learn new tasks, maintain attention and concentration, attend to a routine, maintain a schedule, make appropriate decisions, and interact appropriately with others. (Dkt. # 8 at 22-23).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   At step four, the ALJ determined that the Plaintiff was unable to perform his past relevant work as a spray painter because even though plaintiff had performed some spray painting work during the claimed disability period, the lifting and carrying requirements for the position exceeded his RFC. (Dkt. # 8 at 27).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The ALJ elicited testimony from vocational expert (\"VE\") David A. Festa, who opined that a hypothetical individual sharing plaintiff's age, education, work experience and RFC could perform several positions existing in significant numbers in the\n   national economy, including shipping and receiving weigher, counter clerk, table worker, and food and beverage order clerk. (Dkt. # 8 at 68-71). Accordingly, the ALJ concluded that the plaintiff was not disabled under the Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The Plaintiff argues that the ALJ's determination contained legal error and is unsupported by substantial evidence, because the jobs identified by the VE do not exist in sufficiently \"significant\" numbers, and because the ALJ failed to sufficiently account for plaintiff's intellectual disabilities in his RFC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Jobs Existing in \"Significant Numbers\" in the National Economy\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   At step five of the disability analysis, an ALJ considers the claimant's RFC, age, education, and work experience to determine whether there is substantial gainful work activity, existing in \"significant numbers\" in the national economy, that the claimant can perform.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20404.1520\">\n    20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(4)(v).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Talavera v.

(Dkt. # 8 at 20). Plaintiff never received mental health treatment, nor were any mental limitations documented by any treating physician.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4360980\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/105/223/#p229\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Dr. Sara Long, a psychologist who performed consultative psychological and psychiatric examinations of plaintiff, observed that plaintiff was \"coherent and goal directed,\" with \"no indication of any sensory or thought disorder.\" She found that plaintiff has \"no limitations\" in following and understanding simple directions and performing simple tasks, and could maintain attention and concentration, keep a regular schedule, and learn new tasks. The only substantive limitations identified by Dr. Long, variously characterized as \"moderate\" and \"moderate, at times marked,\" were with respect to engagement in complex tasks and decision-making. Citing their consistency with the record as a whole, the ALJ gave \"great weight\" to Dr. Long's opinions, and explicitly incorporated all of her findings into plaintiff's RFC except for the \"moderate, at times marked\" limitations in complex tasks and decision-making: instead, the ALJ found that the record supported \"no more than moderate\" mental limitations. (Dkt. # 8 at 21, 406-08, 410-13).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Initially, the Court notes that the ALJ's finding that plaintiff's mental limitations are \"no more than moderate\" is supported by substantial evidence of record, including plaintiff's absence of mental health complaints and/or treatment, plaintiff's previous nineteen-year tenure in a semi-skilled position, and plaintiff's self-reported ability to take care of himself and manage his household.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Assuming\n   <em>\n    arguendo\n   </em>\n   that the ALJ erred in failing to explicitly incorporate moderate limitations with respect to complex\n   tasks and decision-making into his RFC finding, and/or erred by failing to limit plaintiff to unskilled work, such error is harmless.
