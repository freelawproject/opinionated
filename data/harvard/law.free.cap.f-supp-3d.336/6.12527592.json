No. 127)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   . Plaintiff filed its respective opposition to said motion. (Dkt. No. 138).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   For the reasons stated herein, the Court\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS\n   </strong>\n   El Conquistador's motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The instant case arises from the death of Dr. George Holland, which happened on January 1, 2013 while vacationing in Puerto Rico. Dr. Holland arrived to Puerto Rico for a vacation with family and friends on or around December 26, 2012 for his mother-in-law's 75\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   birthday and New Year's Eve celebration. During their visit, the group stayed at El Conquistador, located in Fajardo, Puerto Rico.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On January 1, 2013, Dr. Holland, his wife Dr. Laura Baum-Holland, and his three children took El Conquistador's ferry to Palomino\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   with other members of the party.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Third Amended Complaint, Dkt. No. 70, \u00b6 20. Upon their arrival to Palomino, Dr. Holland and other party members rented snorkeling equipment from La Casa del Mar.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 21. The party proceeded to snorkel towards Palominito.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   About half way towards Palominito, Dr. Holland became unresponsive, prompting Plaintiffs' witnesses, Lisa Kaye and Lawrence Evan Jassin to approach Dr. Holland. After several attempts to save Dr. Holland's life, including a transfer to a hospital nearby, was officially pronounced dead.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiffs' Dr. Laura Baum-Holland, widow of deceased Dr. Holland, daughters Sarah and Emily Holland\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   and, son Joseph Holland filed the instant diversity claim against El Conquistador for damages and eventual death of Dr. Holland.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   El Conquistador is seeking summary judgment (Dkt. No. 127), alleging that the vast majority of the critical allegations contained in plaintiffs' Third Amended Complaint fail in truthfulness and thus the summary judgment is warranted dismissing all claims premised therein. El Conquistador avers that the remainder of the allegations concern omissions for which there was no duty to act, and consequently summary judgment is warranted dismissing such claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 127, p. 19. El Conquistador is further requesting summary judgment in favor of co-defendants, Hilton El Con Management, LLC and Hilton El Con Operator, LLC, as they do not own or operate El Conquistador. They are also seeking summary judgment in favor of LXR Luxury Resorts, which they allege is not an actual entity. Plaintiffs have filed their opposition to said motions (Dkt. No. 138). The Court will focus on allegations against El Conquistador moving hereafter. Proper analysis of the parties' motions require careful scrutiny of the underlying legal framework.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    II. FACTUAL FINDINGS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The following factual findings are taken from the parties' statements of undisputed facts, and supported documentation. Upon careful review of the record, the Court finds the following facts are undisputed:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   1.

On January 1, 2013, Dr. Holland rented snorkeling gear from concessionaire, La Casa del Mar for him and his son, Joseph, as well as for some other members of his party.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 138-13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   14. Pursuant to the Concession Agreement, La Casa del Mar is a concessionaire to El Conquistador that rents snorkel equipment to the hotel guests that visit Palomino Island.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Concession Agreement by and Between El Conquistador Partnership L.P., S.E. d/b/a El Conquistador Golf Resort &amp; Casino and La Casa del Mar, Inc. d/b/a La Casa del Mar Dive Center\n   </em>\n   , Dkt. No. 142-4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   15. The rental of the snorkeling equipment was charged to Dr. Holland's room as El Conquistador's guest.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 138-13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   16. Dr. Holland signed the La Casa del Mar Snorkeling Liability and Release Policy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 58,\n   <em>\n    Motion Informing Stipulation of Fact.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   17. When Dr. Holland rented the snorkel equipment, he did not request an available floatation device from the equipment rented to the guests by the concessionaire, La Casa del Mar.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt.

The La Casa del Mar rental concession stand had flotation belts available for rental to snorkelers for a charge of $5.00, and which were hanging behind the counter visible to the public.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 27, l. 3-23, p. 60, l. 4-17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   20. Lyzette Morgan Guzm\u00e1n, La Casa del Mar's employee in charge of renting snorkeling equipment during the date of the incident, attested that people do not rent the belts often.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ms. Morgan's Deposition, Dkt. No. 127-6, p. 36 l. 6-8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   21. According to Ms. Morgan, belts were typically rented for kids.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   p. 42 l. 20-22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   22. Ms. Morgan further testified that there were 12-15 belts available to rent on the date of loss.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   p. 58, l. 5-10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   23. According to the equipment rental log contained in the release, 2 \"velts\" (belts) were rented after Dr. Holland rented the equipment for his party.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Exhibit A, Dkt. No. 58-2;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Ms. Morgan's Deposition, Dkt. No. 127-6, p. 27 l. 3-23.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   24.

No. 127-6, p. 86, l. 16-19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   25. According to Ms. Morgan, she was told by Palomino Water Sports' personnel that the swim from Palomino to Palominito could take between 30 to 45 minutes and that was what she would routinely advice guests when asked.\n   <em>\n    See Ms. Morgan's Unsworn Declaration Under Penalty of Perjury\n   </em>\n   , Dkt. No. 141-9, \u00b6 28.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   26. Plaintiffs retained an expert in oceanography, Dr. Miguel Canals Silander, who has a master's degree in oceanography and a Ph.D. in ocean engineering.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dr. Canals' Deposition, Dkt. No. 127-3, p. 8 l. 18 to p. 9, l. 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   27. Dr. Canals was hired to reconstruct of the oceanographic conditions at and around the time of Dr. Holland's death on January 1, 2013, to take a picture, or a reconstruction of what was happening, in terms of waves, the winds, and the currents, at the time of the incident by plaintiffs.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 29, l. 2-11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   28. While Dr. Holland was snorkeling, the wind speed in the area would have been between 5 and 12 miles per hour, which are typical trade wind conditions for the area in Puerto Rico.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 51, l. 6-7; p. 76 l. 23 to p. 77, l. 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   29. In addition, a \"small westward flow\" of water was caused by the tide dropping.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 52, l. 10-15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   30. The National Weather Service issued a coastal hazard notification warning on January 1, 2013 indicating \"large breaking waves and frequent rip currents resulting in dangerous surf conditions affecting the Atlantic coastlines of Puerto Rico.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 141-1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   31. The National Weather Service advised of waves and surf \"7 to 9 foot north-northwest swells in breaking waves of 10 to 14 feet and locally higher.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   32. Dr. Canals stated there was a weather bulletin that estimated the height of the breaking waves between 10 to 14 feet, but this bulletin is for a completely different location than the area Dr. Canals analyzed between Palomino and Palominito.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 127-3, p. 108, l. 10-25.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   33. On January 1, 2013, at the time and the place of the incident, the conditions that Dr. Canals estimated were drastically different from what was described in the weather bulletin as these facts occurred in the Southern side of Palomino in route to Palominito.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 109, l. 9-20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   34. The reason the oceanographic conditions in the bulletin are different in the exposed Atlantic to the north than those in the Palomino-Palominito area is because there is a barrier of islands and reefs to the north of Palomino, and the waves interact with the local bathymetry of Palomino and Palominito, which is a sheltered environment, and which includes a reef area directly around the north and eastern coast of Palomino Island that further reduces wave energy.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 61 l. 1 to p. 63, l. 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   35. In sum, while the weather bulletin estimated the height of the breaking waves between 10 to 14 feet in the exposed Atlantic, Dr. Canals estimated that the waves between Palomino and Palominito were maybe one to two foot waves.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 60, l. 11-21; 84, l. 11-19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   36. This is the result of waves approaching the barrier of islands and reefs located to the north of Palomino resulting in \"wave dissipation\" and as a result, \"the lee of Palomino and Palominito\" results in a sheltered environment.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 61, l 16 to p. 62, l. 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   37. The tidal change on that day over a 12-hour period was approximately 1 foot, with 1 foot to two feet being typical for the northeastern coast of Puerto Rico.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 53 l. 18-21, p. 56 l. 22 to p. 57, l. 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   38. The westward current in the area between Palomino and Palominito was between 0.3 to 0.45 or between 0.6 and 0.9 knots.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 64, l. 8-12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   39. The maximum 0.9 knots current is a longshore current, which is a current that runs parallel with the coast.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 105 1 to p. 106, l. 25. The current was not a rip current.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 106, l. 23-24.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   40. That same day, Dr. Holland began swimming towards a small island (Palominito) located approximately \u00bd a kilometer away from Palomino.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 70, \u00b6 27.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   41. Dr. Holland was about half way to Palominito when the incident occurred.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 70 \u00b6 28;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 127-11 p. 77.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   42. John Rosado, the owner of Palomino Water Sports, another of El Conquistador's\n   concessions, also testified that on the day and time of the incidents there were strong currents.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Deposition of Mr. Rosado, Dkt. No. 141-7, p. 30 l. 4-6, p. 32 l. 13-25, p. 99 l. 12-25.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   43. As they were trying to rescue Dr. Holland, Mr. Rosado described the current as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   \"Well, when I get over, Jos\u00e9 Caraballo jumped in the water to assist Edward, to see what was the situation. Both of them they do have the lifeguard license, so they just jump in. Uhhh, they tried to pull him over on the jet ski, with the current, and it was really hard, because they would keep dragging, and dragging with the current.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , p. 36, l. 16-22.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   44. Dr. Richard Baum is plaintiff, Laura Baum Holland's brother.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 140,\n   <em>\n    Deposition of Dr. Richard Baum\n   </em>\n   , p. 23, l. 4-8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   45. On the day of the incident, Dr. Richard Baum heard that Dr. Holland was in trouble, so he went and asked an employee with a Jet Ski to take him where the problem with Dr. Holland was occurring.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   p. 26, l. 14-17, p. 27, l. 8-16, p. 28, l. 10-16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   46. The employee went with Dr. Richard Baum, who was on the back of the Jet Ski, and the employee indicated that the person in trouble was on a sailboat.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   p. 29, l. 1-8 and 19-25.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   47. Once the employee and Dr. Baum arrived near the sailboat, they saw his family and co-plaintiff Joseph Holland \"kneeling around Dr. George Holland\".\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   p. 30, l. 1-14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   48. Dr. Richard Baum went on the sailboat and kept monitoring Dr. Holland's vital signs, while Dr. Baum's wife administered Cardio Pulmonary Resuscitation (\"CPR\") to Dr. Holland.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   p. 32, l. 9-12 and p. 32, l. 22 to p. 39, l. 11-17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   49. Dr. Baum noticed that Dr. Holland's pulse remained faint with a shallow respiration until he was brought to shore and that Dr. Holland lost his respiration and pulse on shore.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   p. 43, l. 14-18, p. 44, l. 11-13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   50. Mr. Jassin, another observing witness, stated that while the party was snorkeling, they agreed to stay together and were virtually together the whole time.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mr. Jassin's Deposition\n   </em>\n   , Dkt.

According to Plaintiffs' witness, Lisa Kaye Jassin, while swimming, Dr. Holland was looking straight towards Palominito, was calm, not trashing, and was treading water.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mrs. Jassin's Deposition, Dkt.

Article 1802 states that \"a person who by an act or omission causes damage to another through fault or negligence shall be obliged to repair the damage so done.\" 31 P.R. Laws Ann. \u00a7 5141. Under Article 1802, a plaintiff suing for personal injuries must plead, and ultimately prove, four elements: 1) a duty requiring the defendant to conform to a certain standard of conduct; 2) a breach of that duty; 3) proximate cause; and 4) damages.\n   <em>\n    Coyne v.

The Supreme Court of Puerto Rico has on various occasions noted that \"the requirement of foreseeability is not limited to requiring that the precise risk or consequences have been foreseen,\" explaining that \"the essential [matter] is that there be a duty to foresee in a general way the consequences of a\n   <em>\n    determinate\n   </em>\n   class [of consequences].\"\n   <em>\n    Pab\u00f3n Escab\u00ed v.

Thus, the Supreme Court has stated that \"[t]he lack of light in a stairwell, even if constitutes negligence imputable to the lessor, it is [negligence] in relation with the usual foreseeable risk of injury created by that type of dangerous condition, such as slipping and falling, or tripping up against an object on the floor,\" and therefore held that the lessor was not responsible for a mugging on that same stairwell.\n   <em>\n    Estremera v.

No. 127. Whereas, plaintiffs aver that El Conquistador breached the general duty of care it owed to its guests and clients by not providing basic safeguards to ensure their safety and wellbeing on January 1, 2013; and, in its failure to act with the reasonable prudence and attention that the circumstances demanded.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 70.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   There is no question that while Dr. Holland was engaging a snorkeling activity, he suddenly became unresponsive, and eventually died at the beach. The cause of death according to plaintiffs was drowning, and according to El Conquistador, a cardiorespiratory event due to an untreated heart condition. Additionally, if the Court were to assume that El Conquistador incurred on a negligent act, by preventing to take safety measures, the Court could find a causal relationship between El Conquistador's omission and the incident that resulted in Dr. Holland's death. El Conquistador evidently owed Dr. Holland a general duty of care and protection. However, the Court must determine whether there was a breach of duty of care from El Conquistador for failing to implement a lifeguard program and safety measures in Palomino Island until after the incident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   After a careful examination of the motions and the documents contained therein, the Court finds that plaintiffs have failed to provide evidence that made foreseeable that Dr. Holland's event was bound to occur. As previously stated, Dr. Holland was performing a voluntary recreational activity. It is a known fact that\n   snorkeling is not merely swimming at the beach nor jumping small waves but a much more strenuous activity. Most critical, Dr. Holland suffered from several conditions that would endanger his health upon the performance of extraneous activities such as snorkeling, i.e., (1) untreated hypertension, (2) enlarged liver, (3) slight atherosclerosis, and (4) enlarged heart, to the point of almost double the size of a normal heart, and a thickened blood ventricle, among others. Thus, Dr. Holland decided to engage in a recreational activity \"with full knowledge of the risk, involving a potential \"danger to himself.\"\n   <em>\n    See Rubio,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3351973\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/388/1021/#p1024\">\n     supra.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   The Court finds that Dr. Holland, as a physician was capable of understanding the risks entailed in practicing recreational activities such as snorkeling. Moreover, during his snorkeling expedition of one (1) kilometer towards Palominito, he was accompanied by Mrs. Lisa Jassin, who has specialized training as a lifeguard, CPR and the use of an AED and who immediately helped Dr. Holland in the moments he was in distress at open sea.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Factual Findings \u00b6\u00b6 51-53, 59. The Court further notes that when the emergency situation occurred, Dr. Holland was approximately half way towards Palominito, that is, approximately 250 meters from the shore.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 40-41. Consequently, the first aid provided to Dr. Holland by Mrs. Jassin, who was only 12 feet away, has proven to be much more effective than any help El Conquistador or a lifeguard could have provided Dr. Holland, considering his distance from shore at the time of the event.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Further, his head remained at all times above the water pursuant to the testimony of Lisa Jassin.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 62. Consequently, plaintiffs failed to meet the burden to establish a breach duty of care, as the Court will illustrate hereafter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   It is undisputed that the January 1, 2013, the National Weather Service bulletin submitted by plaintiffs as evidence there were strong currents in Palomino on the day of the incident, is inconsistent with the conditions described in Palomino on the day of the events.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 30-33. Although the bulletin projected waves of 10 to 14 feet, there is undisputed testimony from plaintiffs' own oceanographer expert witness, Dr. Canals that the waves between Palomino and Palominito were about one to two feet only.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 35. The undisputed tidal change was approximately 1 foot, which is typical for the Palomino area.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 37. The undisputed westward current between Palomino and Palominito was 0.3 to 0.45 knots or 0.6 to 0.9 knots.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 38. It is further undisputed that the currents experienced by Dr. Holland were of 0.6 to 0.9 knots.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 87. Consequently, Plaintiffs cannot establish that the weather conditions in Palomino and Palominito on the day of the events were consistent with the weather bulletin. Thus, plaintiffs cannot establish a real hazardous condition at sea during Dr. Holland's expedition. As such, the Court concludes the conditions on Palomino Island on January 1, 2013 were consistent with engaging in snorkeling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   Moreover, as Dr. Holland rented his snorkeling equipment, he did not rent floatation belts, which were available in La Casa del Mar.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b617, 22. It is further undisputed that on the day of the incident, there were 12 to 15 belts available for rent.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 21. The Snorkeling Liability and Release Policy further demonstrates that two belts were rented after Dr. Holland rented the equipment for his party.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 23;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 58-1. Thus, the Court can conclude that when Dr. Holland rented his equipment he decided not to rent floatation devices, although they were readily available for rent and use. Plaintiffs have also failed to submit evidence that there was a duty from El Conquistador to provide floatation devices when practicing snorkeling. It is further undisputed that plaintiffs' own scuba expert, Alberto Marti, confirmed there was no rule, law or regulation requiring the use of floatation devices on January 1, 2013. \u00b6 76.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   As to El Conquistador's lack of lifeguard on duty, the Court finds that Mrs. Jassin, who has lifeguard, CPR and AED training was the\n   <em>\n    idoneus\n   </em>\n   person to aid Dr. Holland while he was physically distressed at open sea, as she was close to Dr. Holland when he became unresponsive. \u00b6\u00b6 51-54, 59. It is further undisputed that the first responder to Dr. Holland's emergency was Mrs. Jassin.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs have failed to submit evidence that proves Dr. Holland would have survived if first aid were provided by El Conquistador instead of Mrs. Jassin. Further, by the time Dr. Holland received assistance from the hotel personnel, CPR had already been performed by Dr. Laura Baum-Holland, Dr. John Ruge, and Dr. Armacost. \u00b6\u00b6 48, 63, 65. Moreover, a defibrillator was available at shore and used on Dr. Holland within approximately ten (10) minutes. \u00b6 69. But, the Court insists that he was duly well attended prior to the use of a defibrillator by physicians Laura Baum-Holland, John Ruge and Melinda Armacost. There are no allegations nor evidence that such efforts were deficient. Further, pursuant to Dr. Ruge's testimony, Dr. Holland was already dead upon his arrival to the shore and before the need of a defibrillator.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   Most critical is the determination of the Court as to whether the release form that Dr. Holland signed as he was renting the snorkeling equipment properly released El Conquistador from any type of liability concerning the instant claim. The Court must also determine whether the release signed by Dr. Holland properly certified that he did not suffer any mental or physical disease, illness or disability that \"would render him unfit for snorkeling.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   discussion,\n   <em>\n    infra.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     D.

The Court also notes that a release must be \"clear, concise and unequivocal\" \"as to put a person on notice of its legal significance and effect.\"\n   <em>\n    Olivelli\n   </em>\n   at 118.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-175\">\n   After a thorough review of the\n   <em>\n    Snorkeling Liability and Release Policy\n   </em>\n   (Dkt. No. 58-2), the Court finds that the release complies with the requirements listed in\n   <em>\n    Olivelli\n   </em>\n   . The document releases concessionaire, La Casa del Mar and El Conquistador \"... from all claim, risk, damage, injury, and liability arising from any injury or illness sustained while engaged in snorkeling caused from any negligence or default of any other snorkelers.\"\n   <em>\n    See supra.\n   </em>\n   Further, the release clearly states that the snorkeling activity is at the own risk of the person. The release further contains a certification that if signed, constitutes a guest's declaration that he has no physical disease, illness or disability that could prevent him from safely practicing snorkeling. The Court finds that Dr. Holland was a physician who was fully aware or should have known as to the of the ramifications of signing a liability and release document, given that, physicians typically provide these types of documents to their patients prior to rendering treatment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-176\">\n   Moreover, when signing the document, Dr. Holland did not disclose that he suffered from several untreated conditions, hence, was at risk when engaging in recreational activities such as snorkeling. Among the conditions that Dr. Holland presented when his autopsy was performed was an untreated hypertension and an enlarged heart weighing 560 grams, almost twice the weight of a normal heart, as a result thereof; slight atherosclerosis ; an enlarged liver of 3,080 grams, that is, 1480 grams larger than a normal liver, brownish-yellow and of hinged consistency, consistent with fatty liver ; and obese in weight. \u00b6\u00b6 94-99. By signing the release document, Dr. Holland certified that he did not suffer from any physical disease that would prevent him from engaging in a\n   snorkeling activity. However, the pathologist's findings during Dr. Holland's autopsy reflect that his physical condition was the complete opposite of what was attested by Dr. Holland in said document.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-177\">\n   Most critical and determinative, Dr. Ruge, the neurosurgeon who assisted Dr. Holland upon his arrival to shore testified that his first assessment as to Dr. Holland's condition upon his arrival to shore was that he was dead, totally cyanotic and blue.

Thus, there was nothing additional that any third party, including El Conquistador, could have done to prevent Dr. Holland's demise while engaging in snorkeling activity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-178\">\n   More importantly, the Court finds that regardless of Dr. Holland's cause of death, he effectively released El Conquistador from liability regarding the snorkeling activity he was engaging in prior to his demise. However, the Court notes that plaintiffs failed to submit evidence in the instant summary judgment request and opposition thereto that could prove that El Conquistador could have played a role or could be liable as to Dr. Holland's accidental death.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-179\">\n   <strong>\n    V. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-180\">\n   It is well established that at summary judgment stage, the moving party bears a two-fold burden: it must show that there is \"no genuine issue as to any material fact\"; as well as that it is \"entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\"\n   <em>\n    Vega-Rodr\u00edguez v. Puerto Rico Telephone Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"694939\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/110/174/#p179\">\n    110 F.3d 174\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 179 (1st Cir. 1997). It is equally well-established that \"[c]redibility determinations, the weighing of the evidence, and the drawing of legitimate inferences from the facts are jury functions, not those of a judge.\"\n   <em>\n    Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Prod.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413371\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/133/#p135\">\n    530 U.S. 133\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 150,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413371\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/133/#p135\">\n    120 S.Ct. 2097\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413371\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/133/#p135\">\n    147 L.Ed.2d 105\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2000) (internal citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-181\">\n   Furthermore, at this stage of the proceedings, the Court must \"draw all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to [the non-moving party].\"\n   <em>\n    Vera v. McHugh\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3786963\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/622/17/#p26\">\n    622 F.3d 17\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 26 (1st Cir. 2010). Even when doing so, the Court finds that summary judgment is warranted in the instant case as plaintiffs have failed to submit evidence that establishes a duty of care that was breached by El Conquistador. More importantly, Dr. Holland voluntarily signed the\n   <em>\n    Snorkeling Liability and Release Policy\n   </em>\n   prior to engaging in a demanding recreational activity, wherein he affirmatively attested that he was in a physical condition that renders him fit to engage in snorkeling between two (2) islands that were one (1) kilometer apart from each other. Hence, regardless of Dr. Holland's cause of death, a release was effectively obtained and no breach of duty, law or regulation has been found by the Court. Consequently, the Court hereby\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS\n   </strong>\n   El Conquistador's motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-182\">\n   For all the reasons elucidated herein, El Conquistador's motion for summary judgment at Dkt. No. 127 is hereby\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   . Judgment of dismissal is to be entered accordingly.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-183\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS SO ORDERED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-186\">\n    El Conquistador submitted a\n    <em>\n     Supporting Statement of Material Facts\n    </em>\n    .\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Dkt.
