(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 19.) Plaintiff and Counterclaim Defendant S &amp; R is a New York limited-liability company managed by brothers Stephen and Richard Troy. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In approximately 2006, S &amp; R purchased, and since then has attempted to develop, a parcel of land directly adjacent to the Sisters' convent. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 65, 95.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The Sisters purchased the 6.7-acre lot which is used for their convent in 1996. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 2, 26.) They use their land to \"conduct daily prayer and meditation\" and \"spiritual reading and study.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 25.) The Sisters allege that the parcel's relative distance from developed land is vital to their \"need for quiet and privacy\" and their religious practice. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 29.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The Sisters allege that certain restrictive covenants on the use of adjacent land were also important to their decision to purchase their land.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 43) The Sisters' land and all of the adjacent parcels are part of a ten-lot subdivision that was created by a March 1912 deed. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 5, 37.) The deed included restrictive covenants that banned, among other things, the building of \"tenements and flat houses so-called.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 26, 37.) The Sisters argue that this ban continues in force and restricts the building of any modern apartment building. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 110.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Following its acquisition of the neighboring property, S &amp; R received a permit to demolish the then-existing home and swimming pool, and submitted plans to build thirty-seven \"market rate\" apartments. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 67.) On August 17, 2009, S &amp; R publicly announced a new plan to build forty-one \"affordable housing\" units instead. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 95.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   S &amp; R and the Town were involved in multiple lawsuits as early as 2008 regarding whether the zoning of its land allowed for the development of a housing project. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 94.) In March 2008, the Sisters notified the Town that they opposed any zoning change to S &amp; R's property that would interfere with the zoning classification that guaranteed their peaceful setting. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 92-93.) During a Town Planning Board hearing held in February 2013 regarding S &amp; R's request for a zoning variance, the Edgemont Community Council, a local civic group, raised the issue of the restrictive covenant, which brought it to the attention of the Sisters' counsel, who was at the meeting. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 102, 103.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On March 2, 2013, the Sisters sent a letter to S &amp; R reserving its rights under the restrictive covenant. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 106.) Following receipt of this letter, S &amp; R commenced a suit against the Sisters in Westchester County Supreme Court seeking to extinguish the enforcement of the covenant. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 107.) After this suit was dismissed on procedural grounds, a second\n   suit was filed on March 4, 2016, and is currently pending. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 107-108.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n    <em>\n     Procedural History\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On October 14, 2016, S &amp; R commenced this action claiming, among other things, that the Sisters selectively enforced the covenant against it in violation of the Fair Housing Act of 1968 (\"FHA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%203601\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3601\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 1.) On February 17, 2017, S &amp; R filed an Amended Complaint including the same claim against the Sisters. (Doc. 78.) The Sisters moved to dismiss, (Doc. 103), and in an oral ruling on September 20, 2017, the Court denied the motion, (Minute Entry dated Sept. 20, 2017).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On October 20, 2017, the Sisters filed an Answer to the Amended Complaint and Counterclaim. (Doc. 129.) On October 31, 2017, S &amp; R filed a letter seeking a pre-motion conference to discuss its anticipated motion to dismiss the counterclaim. (Doc. 133.) The Sisters responded on November 8, 2017, (Doc. 136), and at a pre-motion conference on November 15, 2017, the Sisters were granted leave to amend their counterclaim. (Minute Entry dated Nov. 15, 2017.) On December 7, 2017, the Sisters filed an Amended Answer and Counterclaim. (Doc. 139.) On December 22, 2017, S &amp; R filed the instant motion to dismiss the counterclaim. (Doc. 140.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In their counterclaim, the Sisters allege that in the event that S &amp; R's FHA claims succeed, they should be entitled to compensation for any damages suffered as a result of the \"extinguishment\" of their restrictive covenant. (ACC \u00b6\u00b6 122, 125.) The Sisters' position is that New York Real Property Actions and Proceedings Law (\"RPAPL\") \u00a7 1951(2) allows for recovery of the monetary value of a covenant that has been deemed unenforceable, regardless of the reason.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   New York Real Prop. Acts. Law \u00a7 1951(2) (McKinney 2018); ACC \u00b6 122.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   S &amp; R responds that any state law claim for damages plainly conflicts with Congress's intent in passing the FHA and is therefore preempted. (Doc. 141 (\"P's Mem.\") at 4) (\"It would be perverse to allow a state-law claim to require the victims of housing discrimination to compensate the perpetrators for the privilege of being their neighbors.\"). S &amp; R also argues that the Sisters fail to state a claim under RPAPL \u00a7 1951(2). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6 n.1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The Sisters respond that allowing the FHA to preempt \u00a7 1951(2) claims would amount to a \"taking\" without just compensation in violation of the Fifth Amendment. (Doc. 143 (\"D's Opp.\") at 13.) They allege further that in areas where state police powers have traditionally governed, there is a strong presumption against federal preemption and that the standard for showing preemption is rigorous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     LEGAL STANDARD\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \"A motion to dismiss a counterclaim is evaluated under the same standard as a motion to dismiss a complaint.\"\n   <em>\n    Holborn Corp. v.

Enforcing a state statute that compensates an FHA violator would undermine Congress's purpose in achieving the result of the availability of fair housing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Not only does the FHA include manifest results-oriented language, but it has no language suggesting that owners whose property loses value as a result of the statute are entitled to compensation. Congress surely envisioned that rectifying historical discrimination in housing might have a negative effect on property values in some instances, and it surely knew how to provide for remuneration for those losses if it thought that was fitting. Congress's omission of any such provision signals its belief that any diminution in property value was an appropriate price to pay for fair housing, and thus to allow such compensation pursuant to state law would contradict the statutory scheme.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The stated goal of the FHA is \"regulatory rather than compensatory,\"\n   <em>\n    Equal Rights Ctr. v.

In other words,\n   the language and structure of the statute evidence Congress's intent to achieve the result of fair housing not only by remedying obstacles but also via deterrence. That goal - deterring even acts that unintentionally create disparate impact in housing - would be circumvented if violators could be compensated, at the victims' expense, for losses arising from the violation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Congress's stated intent also limits what avenues are available to a party that violates the FHA.

But the court in\n   <em>\n    Miami Valley\n   </em>\n   , citing\n   <em>\n    Niles Bolton\n   </em>\n   , held that the FHA does not allow for claims of indemnification and contribution.\n   <em>\n    Miami Valley Fair Hous.

And, to whatever extent contribution or indemnification were even allowed, it would only make sense in a case involving contribution from co-defendants or third parties responsible in part for the violation. In this case, however, there is no other wrongdoer or responsible party.
