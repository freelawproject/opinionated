(\"AdvoCare\") [ECF No. 34] and the Motion to Dismiss filed by Defendants Wes Bewley, Tyler Deberry, Jenny Donnelly, Dawn Funk, Daniel McDaniel, and Crystal Thurber (collectively, the \"Individual Defendants\") [ECF No. 35]. For the reasons set forth below, the Court grants in part and denies in part the motions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Pursuant to Special Order 3-318, this case was transferred from the docket of Judge Jane J. Boyle to the docket of this Court on March 8, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   This class action lawsuit arises out of allegations that AdvoCare, a company that distributes health and nutritional products, is a pyramid scheme. Plaintiffs Lisa Ranieri (\"Ranieri\") and Megan Cornelius (\"Cornelius\") allege that AdvoCare is a pyramid scheme \"with a twist\" because it sells participants both a product and the right to share in the money paid by other participants. Compl. \u00b6 3. The participants in AdvoCare's system are called \"Distributors.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 5. Plaintiffs are former Distributors.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 191-98. Defendants are AdvoCare and certain individuals that are at or near the top of AdvoCare's alleged pyramid.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 11, 23.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   To become a Distributor, one must purchase a kit, which cost either $59 or $79 during the relevant time.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 42. Distributors have two opportunities to earn money through AdvoCare: selling products and recruiting other Distributors into their downline.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 3, 5-6. Distributors earn commissions and bonuses through their own sales and those of their downlines.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 8, 48. AdvoCare receives money from Distributors in the form of fees and product purchases.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 45. In their Complaint, Plaintiffs review at length the commission, bonus, and discount opportunities available to Distributors.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 48, 51, 72. Plaintiffs allege that all of these opportunities require Distributors to purchase more product than they can consume or sell and/or that they prioritize recruiting over retail sales.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 50, 55-56.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Once a Distributor has generated a certain level of product purchases, either personally or through junior Distributors in his or her downline, he or she can graduate to the Advisor level.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 47. Many of the bonuses and incentives Plaintiffs discuss are only available to Advisors.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 63.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   According to Plaintiffs, there is no real opportunity to profit from retail sales, and recruiting is the only way to succeed as a Distributor.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 6, 8. They allege that very few people actually make money through AdvoCare, and that the vast majority end up paying more money to AdvoCare than they ever receive in profits.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10. Further, Plaintiffs contend that most of the money paid out to Distributors comes not from sales to non-Distributors but from the investments made by other Distributors.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 107.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Individual Defendants represent individuals that have made it to the top of the AdvoCare pyramid and thus have profited from the alleged pyramid scheme.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 11. All of the Individual Defendants have produced videos and made statements on the Internet promoting AdvoCare and touting the benefits of joining.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 147. Plaintiffs detail specific statements made\n   by each Defendant in promotional videos and on their AdvoCare microsites (individual websites hosted by AdvoCare) and explain why they are misleading.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 149-75, 177-78. Finally, Plaintiffs allege that the Distributor Defendants work in concert with AdvoCare to promote the company.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 176, 179.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Plaintiffs Ranieri and Cornelius joined AdvoCare in 2007 and 2014, respectively, and both were terminated in 2016.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 191, 194-98. Ranieri and Cornelius, individually and on behalf of a putative class of similarly situated persons, sued AdvoCare on five counts and the Individual Defendants on three. First, they seek a declaratory judgment declaring the arbitration provision in their contracts unenforceable.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Second, they allege that both AdvoCare and the Individual Defendants violated Sections 1962(c) and (d) of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (\"RICO\"). Plaintiffs allege both primary RICO violations\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   and conspiracy to violate RICO. Third, they allege that AdvoCare committed federal securities fraud.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Complaint does not indicate on which provision(s) of the federal securities laws Plaintiffs' claims are based. Fourth, Plaintiffs bring a claim for unjust enrichment against AdvoCare.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

While the Court expresses no opinion on whether AdvoCare is in fact operating a pyramid scheme, the Complaint includes sufficient allegations, taken as true, to establish a strong inference of fraudulent intent. For example, Plaintiffs outline attempts made by AdvoCare to distinguish its model from that of a pyramid scheme and contradict each attempt with factual allegations. First, AdvoCare requires Distributors to submit Retail Sales Compliance Forms, on which Distributors must list five retail sales made to five different customers, before they can receive a bonus for a given pay period. Compl. \u00b6 122. However, Plaintiffs claim that AdvoCare has never systematically audited these forms to ensure their accuracy.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 123.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Second, AdvoCare requires Distributors to certify that at least 70 percent of products previously purchased were either sold or consumed by the Distributor.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 124.

Finally, AdvoCare offers two refund policies. One allows for the refund of up to $500 worth of products so long as the products are unopened, undamaged, and submitted for a refund within 30 days of purchase. Compl. \u00b6 127. The other allows for the refund of the value of all unopened product within one year of purchase so long as the Distributor resigns at the time he or she returns the product.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs point to several deficiencies in these policies, including the fact that they are limited in time, are limited to unopened product, and provide no protection for Distributors who are forced to sell heavily discounted products, to give away products, or to consume unwanted products.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 130-32.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   In addition, Plaintiffs point to statements and promotional materials that give rise to a strong inference of fraudulent\n   intent. For example, they point to an outright denial by the General Counsel for AdvoCare that AdvoCare is a pyramid scheme. Compl. \u00b6 188. Further, they discuss various promotional materials indicating that success in AdvoCare is both realistic and achievable through hard work. Taking the allegations that AdvoCare is a pyramid scheme as true, as the Court must do, these statements are indicative of an intent to defraud.

As discussed above, the Court holds that the Individual Defendants did not operate the pyramid scheme.

Thus, they argue, allegations that the Individual Defendants supervised the pyramid scheme suffice to show scienter.

Accordingly,\n   <em>\n    Torres\n   </em>\n   does not support Plaintiffs' position.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Because the Complaint is devoid of any other facts giving rise to a strong inference of fraudulent intent, the Court finds that Plaintiffs have not adequately pleaded scienter as to the Individual Defendants. Plaintiffs claim that the Individual Defendants are \"well aware of\" the fact that very few Distributors achieve financial success through AdvoCare, but they do not allege how the Individual Defendants would have gained this knowledge. Compl. \u00b6 174. Nor do Plaintiffs explain how the knowledge that few people succeed as AdvoCare Distributors would translate into knowledge that AdvoCare is an illegal pyramid scheme. Plaintiffs spend several pages detailing how the Individual Defendants defended AdvoCare from pyramid scheme allegations but provide no facts or circumstances from which the Court can infer that they knew or showed reckless disregard for the truth of these assertions. In fact, Plaintiffs note that, in the quintessential pyramid scheme, \"participants,\n   <em>\n    knowingly or not\n   </em>\n   , just feed off each other's money and are highly incentivized to bring new participants into the scheme.\" Compl. \u00b6 37 (emphasis added). Plaintiffs' allegations provide no support for the idea that the Individual Defendants possessed knowledge about the alleged AdvoCare pyramid scheme not possessed by lower-level Distributors. The fact that they have made significant profits and have risen within the ranks of AdvoCare participants is not enough to establish scienter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Because the Court has identified multiple flaws with Plaintiffs' RICO pleadings as to the Individual Defendants' alleged primary RICO violations, it grants the Individual Defendants' Motion to Dismiss as to this claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <strong>\n    iii.\n    <em>\n     Individual Defendants - RICO Conspiracy\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   There are two central issues with Plaintiffs' RICO conspiracy claims.

Second, Plaintiffs have not sufficiently alleged an agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Plaintiffs argue that the Individual Defendants' participation in the scheme, along with the similarity and consistency of the Individual Defendants' and AdvoCare's conduct, suffice to show an agreement. Specifically, Plaintiffs point to the allegations surrounding the Individual Defendants' microsites and their promotional videos and materials. Because the microsites are hosted and promoted by AdvoCare, Plaintiffs argue, they are evidence that the Individual Defendants and AdvoCare are \"expressly working together to ... promote the pyramid scheme,\" Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 176-77. This argument is unavailing. According to Plaintiffs, all Distributors have AdvoCare-provided microsites.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 49, 58. Plaintiffs fail to distinguish the Individual Defendants from the plethora of other Distributors who take advantage of the microsite platform. Without such differentiation, it is unclear to the Court how the Individual Defendants' use of their microsites manifests any sort of agreement among the Individual Defendants and/or between the Individual Defendants and AdvoCare.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   For similar reasons, the alleged consistency and similarity of Defendants' conduct\n   is insufficient evidence of an agreement. Plaintiffs again attempt to rely on the Individual Defendants' success to argue that they must have some role in AdvoCare's alleged pyramid scheme. However, their allegations do not explain why not every Distributor who promotes AdvoCare would be in violation of RICO. According to the Complaint, 747 participants made $50,000 or more per year, yet Plaintiffs only sued six of them. Compl. \u00b6 139. The pleadings do not explain what differentiates these six, and they do not provide evidence that they entered into an agreement with AdvoCare.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Because Plaintiffs have failed to allege specifically a facially plausible agreement to commit predicate acts, the Court grants the Individual Defendants' Motion to Dismiss on this ground.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <strong>\n    C.\n    <em>\n     Securities Fraud\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Plaintiffs bring securities fraud claims solely against AdvoCare.

[Earning income from retail sales] is the simplest way to earn income at AdvoCare. As a Distributor, you purchase products directly from the company at a discount ranging from 20 to 40 percent. You then sell the products at suggested retail value to your retail customers. The difference between what you paid for the products (at your discount) and what you sell them for at retail (what your customer pays you) is your immediate profit.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Compl. \u00b6 245. Plaintiffs argue that this statement is misleading because it does not inform Distributors that retail sales are not actually a viable source of income. Next, Plaintiffs take issue with a statement in the Policies that \"The Compensation Plan is a work plan, and your compensation will depend on how much effort you expend, and to some extent, what area of the country you live in\" (the \"Effort Statement\"). Compl. \u00b6 247. Plaintiffs argue that this statement is misleading because it \"fails to inform Distributors that very few Distributors are likely to earn any profit from participating in AdvoCare, regardless of how much work they put in and regardless of what part of the country they live in.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 248.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   AdvoCare argues that Plaintiffs' pleadings fall short as to three elements of a Rule 10b-5(b) claim: materiality, reliance, and scienter. As to materiality, AdvoCare argues that the Retail Statement is not misleading when read in context. The Court disagrees, However, the Court reaches a different conclusion with regard to the Effort Statement. Plaintiffs attack this statement on the ground that it does not indicate that very few Distributors are likely to earn any profit, but the statement does not contain any express or implied promise of a profit. Thus, it does not conflict with the alleged actual state of affairs.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    R2 Invs. LDC v. Phillips\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9174276\" index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/401/638/#p642\">\n    401 F.3d 638\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 642 (5th Cir. 2005) (finding no actionable misstatement or omission where alleged true state of affairs did not make statement untrue or misleading). Thus, while the Retail Statement satisfies the materiality requirement, the Effort Statement does not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Next, AdvoCare argues that Plaintiffs have not adequately alleged reliance. Reliance \"generally requires that the plaintiff have known of the particular misrepresentation ..., have believed it to be true[,] and because of that knowledge and belief purchased or sold the security in question.\"\n   <em>\n    Nathenson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9498552\" index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/267/400/#p406\">\n    267 F.3d at 413\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Plaintiffs argue that they are entitled to a presumption of reliance because AdvoCare represents that it is a \"legal multi-level marketing program, when it is in fact a fraudulent pyramid scheme.\"\n   <em>\n    Torres\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12173375\" index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/838/629/#p639\">\n    838 F.3d at 643\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . However,\n   <em>\n    Torres\n   </em>\n   is a RICO case, and RICO does not always require proof of first-party reliance.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12173375\" index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/838/629/#p639\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12173375\" index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/838/629/#p639\">\n    at 639\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

This Court declines to extend the\n   <em>\n    Torres\n   </em>\n   presumption of reliance to the securities fraud context. Without the assistance of a presumption, the Court finds that Plaintiffs' pleadings are inadequate to show that they relied on any alleged misrepresentations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Finally, as to scienter, AdvoCare argues that Plaintiffs' allegations fail because they do not link any specific individual to any of the challenged statements. Further, AdvoCare argues that where Plaintiffs did plead scienter, they did so in a conclusory fashion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Compl. \u00b6 251 (\"AdvoCare made these omissions knowing that doing so was false and misleading.\").

CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the Court grants in part and denies in part both motions to dismiss. The Court denies both motions with regard to the argument that the PSLRA bars Plaintiffs' RICO causes of action, and the Court denies AdvoCare's motion to dismiss Plaintiffs' claims predicated on primary RICO violations. In all other respects, both motions are granted. The Court grants AdvoCare's motion to dismiss Plaintiffs' RICO conspiracy claim, securities fraud claim predicated on Rule 10b-5(b), and unjust enrichment claim. The Court grants the Individual Defendants' motion to dismiss all RICO causes of action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   The Court dismisses Plaintiffs' unjust enrichment cause of action with prejudice. With regard to all other claims, the Court dismisses Plaintiffs' causes of action without prejudice. Plaintiffs must seek leave to file an amended complaint by September 11, 2018. If a motion for leave to file, with the proposed amended complaint attached, is not filed by this date, Plaintiffs' claims will be dismissed with prejudice. Although the Court will allow Plaintiffs to amend their complaint, the Court notes that amendment may be futile with regard to the Individual Defendants. Plaintiffs should be mindful of the requirement that claims must be \"warranted by existing law or by a nonfrivolous argument for extending, modifying, or reversing existing law or for establishing new law.\" FED.
