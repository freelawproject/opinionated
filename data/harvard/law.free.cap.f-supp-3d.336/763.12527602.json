Plaintiffs allege that Baylor's failure to promptly and appropriately investigate and respond to student sexual assaults substantially increased the risk of sexual assault for Plaintiffs and for all female students at Baylor. They further allege that Baylor's own policies and selective conduct code enforcement created a discriminatory environment for female students that fostered sexual harassment and sexual assault and denied educational opportunities to Plaintiffs and other female students. Plaintiffs seek to hold Baylor liable under Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 (\"Title IX\"). Title IX provides that \"[n]o person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201681\">\n    20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). (Am. Compl., Dkt. 14).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Baylor moves to dismiss each Plaintiffs' claims. (Dkts. 20, 21, 22, 23). Baylor attempts to disclaim liability by arguing that Plaintiffs' alleged assaults were outside of their control, (Def.'s Mot. Dismiss Doe 12, Dkt. 20, at 6), that Baylor's investigations were not \"clearly unreasonable,\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 12), and that Baylor's written policy prohibiting sex discrimination protects the university from certain claims under Title IX, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 8). The Court disagrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   At this stage of litigation, the Court considers only whether Plaintiffs' Complaint contains sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face. Among their claims, Plaintiffs allege that Baylor discouraged them from reporting their assaults, failed to adequately investigate each of the assaults, misled and lied to Plaintiffs about their options for reporting and accommodations, and obstructed Plaintiffs' access to medical and mental health treatment. They also allege that these practices chilled other students from reporting sexual harassment. Plaintiffs assert that Baylor's practices in handling their reports reflect the school's widespread practice of mishandling reports of peer sexual assault. They allege that Baylor and its highest officers permitted the creation of a campus environment \"rife with sexual assault,\" (Am. Compl., Dkt. 14, at \u00b6 23), that \"substantially increased Plaintiffs' chances of being sexually assaulted,\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 1), and ultimately created a hostile educational environment that deprived Plaintiffs of a normal college education, educational opportunities, and future earning capacity, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 45-46).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   What Plaintiffs allege-a widespread pattern of discriminatory responses to female students' reports of sexual assault permitted by high-ranking, policy-setting\n   Baylor officials-presents a serious and plausible claim to relief under Title IX. Even those Supreme Court justices who expressed skepticism regarding holding institutions liable under Title IX for sexual assaults of individual students have suggested that \"a clear pattern of discriminatory enforcement of school rules could raise an inference that the school itself is discriminating.\"\n   <em>\n    Davis v.

FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Plaintiffs are four women who were students at Baylor at the time of the events at issue in this lawsuit. (Am. Compl., Dkt. 14, \u00b6\u00b6 1-4). Each Plaintiff alleges one or more sexual assaults by fellow Baylor students between 2012 and 2016, including assaults committed by members of the Baylor football team and one member of the Baylor rugby team. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 85, 107-08). Each Plaintiff also alleges that she reported her assault to-and was met with an indifferent and inadequate response from-the Baylor Counseling Center, the Baylor police department, the Title IX office, or another student services office. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 54, 80, 86, 96, 110, 140-43). Plaintiffs allege that \"high-level, policy-setting\" Baylor employees and officials \"did not cause any change in the sexually hostile environment at the University\" even after receiving numerous, detailed reports of sexual assault. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 38-39). Instead, Plaintiffs allege that Baylor discouraged them from reporting their assaults, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 55-57, 81, 111, 180), failed to adequately investigate each of the assaults, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 31-32), misled and lied to Plaintiffs about their options for reporting and accommodations, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 40), and obstructed Plaintiffs' access to medical and mental health treatment, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 44, 61-62, 81, 88, 158-61). Plaintiffs allege that Baylor's actions caused Plaintiffs profound psychological damage and distress and negatively affected their future relationships. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 43-44).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Plaintiffs assert that Baylor's practices in handling their reports reflect the school's widespread practice of mishandling reports of peer sexual assault. They allege that Baylor permitted the creation of a campus condition \"rife with sexual assault,\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 23), that \"substantially increased Plaintiffs' chances of being sexually assaulted,\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 1), chilled student reporting of sexual assault and harassment,\n   (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 36), and ultimately created a hostile educational environment that deprived Plaintiffs of a normal college education, educational opportunities, and future earning capabilities, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 45-46).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Specifically, each Plaintiff makes the following individual allegations:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Jane Doe 12 (or \"Doe 12\"), who enrolled at Baylor in 2014, alleges she was raped by another Baylor student in March 2016. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 50, 69). She first reported to a friend shortly after the assault and then reported the assault to a professor approximately two weeks later. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 51-52). After her professor reported the assault to the department head, \"ultimately an email was sent informing Title IX.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 52-53). She alleges that when she met with Baylor's Title IX office, the office staff misinformed her and concealed information about additional reporting options, accommodations available under Title IX, and the availability of investigatory actions that could be undertaken by the university. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 54-56, 75). The office staff advised her that \"reporting to the police would mean a 5 year investigation,\" which \"could possibly derail per plans to study abroad,\" and that \"if her assailant graduated prior to the conclusion of a police investigation, the University would not be able to punish him.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 56). As a result, Jane Doe 12 \"chose to go through Title IX only\" and did not file a police report. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 57). After she made this choice, her assigned Title IX investigator went on vacation, and her case went \"untouched\" for a week even after she contacted the office multiple times. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 58). Jane Doe 12 requested academic support and counseling through the Title IX office. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 60). For several months following her assault, she experienced panic attacks and anxiety and was unable to be by herself. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 59). She attempted to avoid her assailant, but fear of running into him caused her anxiety in public at all times. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The Title IX office referred her to \"an outside counselor that did not take her insurance.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 61). When she explained this, the Title IX office did not offer alternatives, and instead encouraged her \"to keep the appointment to see 'if it worked out.' \" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Jane Doe 12 could not afford the appointment and \"had no choice but to cancel.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Baylor's Title IX office did not refer her to the Advocacy Center, which offered free counseling. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 62). The Title IX office also communicated inaccurate information to her professors, which required Jane Doe 12 to meet with professors to explain her situation, causing embarrassment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 63). Before the assault, Jane Doe 12 was on the Dean's List and received academic scholarships. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 65, 48). After the assault, she failed courses, received \"incompletes\" on her transcript, had to retake courses, and became ineligible to study abroad. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 66). Her GPA dropped substantially. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 60). She was required to delay her graduation and lost her academic scholarship. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 66). This also increased her financial burden. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 73). She successfully appealed the termination of her academic scholarship, but Baylor allowed her just one semester to improve her GPA in order to retain it. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 74). When Jane Doe 12 informed Baylor's Title IX office of her struggles, they encouraged her to \"move on, push through, and to get over it.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 67). The Title IX office conducted an investigation and found Jane Doe 12's assailant responsible for sexual assault but \"no meaningful action was taken.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 67). The sole consequence for her assailant was a no-contact order for the duration of his time at Baylor. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). When Jane Doe 12 appealed their decision, Baylor suspended her for three months. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 70). Jane Doe 12 alleges that Baylor's lack of knowledgeable staff and inadequate Title IX office substantially impaired her higher education experience and severely impaired\n   her physical and mental health. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 76).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Jane Doe 13 (or \"Doe 13\"), who enrolled in Fall 2011, alleges she was sexually assaulted three times while she was a student at Baylor. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 78, 84, 96). She was first assaulted by another Baylor student in April 2012. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 78-79). She reported the assault to Baylor's Counseling Center in Fall 2012. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 80). She alleges that the Baylor counselor she met with misinformed her and concealed information about additional reporting options, accommodations available under Title IX, and the availability of investigatory actions that could be undertaken by the university. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 81). Baylor staff placed Jane Doe 13 in group counseling sessions \"where discussions of retaliation against reporters of sexual harassment were common.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 82). The Baylor counselor present failed to \"correct these narratives,\" causing Jane Doe 13 \"to fear further reporting her assault.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). In the Fall of 2012, Jane Doe 13 was sexually assaulted a second time. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 84).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The second assailant was a member of the Baylor rugby team. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 85). She reported this to her counselor at the Baylor Counseling Center. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 86). She alleges that Baylor staff again \"manipulated [her] into not pursuing her rights.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 77). She experienced heavy anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder (\"PTSD\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 91, 93). She was subject to repeated on-campus encounters with her assailants and experienced panic attacks each time. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 87). She struggled with classes. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 91). The Baylor Counseling Center was often \"too busy\" and did not have time available for her. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 88). When the Center turned her away, \"she would breakdown crying,\" and on one occasion \"a nurse found her in tears unable to move.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Instead of receiving help with accommodations from the Title IX office, Jane Doe 13 sought academic accommodations on her own. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 89). When she sought help from the Office of Access and Learning Accommodation, they requested academic accommodations for Jane Doe 13 by writing to her professors that she had \"mental issues.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Jane Doe 13 \"struggled in her course work,\" failed one class, and had to pay to take it a second time. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 77). Her GPA fell \"almost a point.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 95).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Jane Doe 13 was sexually assaulted a third time when, \"[d]espite reporting the second assault and her concerns regarding Assailant 16,\" Baylor permitted him \"to follow her on a study abroad program\" hosted by Baylor.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 96). Jane Doe 13 alleges that Baylor's failure to respond to sexual assaults fostered an environment that led to her assaults. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 102). Before her assaults, Jane Doe 13 received several scholarships and was scheduled to graduate with a master's degree. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 77, 99). Since her assaults, Jane Doe 13 has experienced \"great mental distress\" that interferes with her daily routine, lost eligibility for certain scholarships, and had to delay her graduation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 98-99). Jane Doe 13\n   alleges that Baylor's actions and inactions have caused her severe physical and mental health impairments that continue today. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 102). She alleges that Baylor's lack of knowledgeable staff and the \"non-existence\" of a Title IX office substantially impaired her higher education experience and severely impaired her physical and mental health. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 103).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Jane Doe 14 (or \"Doe 14\"), who enrolled at Baylor in Fall 2014, alleges she was sexually assaulted by two members of the Baylor football team in April 2016, at student housing owned by Baylor. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 106-09). She reported the assaults to Baylor's Counseling Center, the Baylor Police Department, and the Title IX office. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 110). She alleges that Baylor staff misled her about additional reporting options, accommodations available under Title IX, and the availability of investigatory actions that could be undertaken by the university. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 111). She alleges that Baylor staff \"manipulated [her] into not pursuing her rights.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 112). When Jane Doe 14 explained her assault and requested academic accommodations from a professor, the professor \"declined accommodations and told her that despite bad things happening, life still goes on.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 113). After her assault, Jane Doe 14 was placed on academic probation and then advised that \"she had to go to another institution of higher education before she would be allowed to continue her course of study at Baylor.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 114, 117). Jane Doe 14 took classes elsewhere, but when she attempted to re-enroll, she found that Baylor Judicial Affairs had placed a hold on her account. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 118, 121). She alleges that Baylor's stated reason for the hold-certain text messages she allegedly sent while she was not enrolled at Baylor-was pretextual, and that Baylor's real reason was to retaliate for reporting her sexual assault. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 119-20, 124). Baylor allowed Jane Doe 14 to re-enroll, but has since charged her with misconduct under the university Code of Conduct. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 128, 130). Since the assault, Jane Doe 14's academic performance has \"significantly declined.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 133). Jane Doe 14 remains \"obligated on substantial student debt with little academic credit to show for it,\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 115), and she \"continues to struggle mentally and physically.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 132).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Jane Doe 15 (or \"Doe 15\"), who enrolled at Baylor in August 2014, alleges she was sexually assaulted by another student in February 2016. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 134, 136). After the assault, she went to a local hospital, which completed a Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (\"SANE\") exam. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 137). Jane Doe 15 reported the assault to the Waco Police Department. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 138). Three professors visited her, and one reported the assault to the Title IX office. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 139). The day after the assault, Jane Doe 15 reported to the Baylor Police Department. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 140). Jane Doe 15's parents also contacted the Baylor Police Department and the Baylor Chaplain, requesting assistance. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 140). Jane Doe 15's father contacted then-Baylor President Kenneth Star. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 141). The Title IX office reassured Jane Doe 15 that she would receive assistance with academic accommodations, counseling, relocation, and a protective order. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 142). Jane Doe 15 was then repeatedly referred to Baylor staff who did not provide assistance. The Title IX office referred her to a chaplain to assist with housing, but he did not respond to repeated attempts to reach him. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 144-45). She was referred to the Vice President for Student Life, Martha Lou Scott, who told Jane Doe 15 that her office could not do anything to help and \"told her that she should take advantage of having her mom in town.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 143). Baylor staff also told Jane Doe 15 that her assailant would be suspended and that he would be arrested if he attempted to come to campus. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 148). But when her assailant returned to campus, Baylor staff did not have him\n   arrested and they did not warn Jane Doe 15 that he had returned to campus. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 149-50). Baylor conducted an investigation and found her assailant responsible, but failed to inform Jane Doe 15 of the adjudication in a timely manner, which caused unnecessary emotional distress. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 156). The Title IX office informed her that because the case was closed, they would not provide any other assistance to her \"academically or otherwise.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 157). Jane Doe 15 states that by Fall 2016, she was \"left to navigate accommodations, protective orders and housing on her own.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 147). Jane Doe 15 was harassed by other Baylor students and subjected to student retaliation, but Baylor took no steps to help her even after she informed them of the continued harassment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 152-54). She sought counseling from the Baylor Counseling Center, but was charged for her sessions after exhausting the seven free sessions allotted to her, until her mother intervened. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 158). \"At no point\" did any Baylor staff refer her to the Advocacy Center, which offered free counseling. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 159). Instead, the Baylor Counseling Center often advised Jane Doe 15 that they were \"too busy\" to schedule appointments, and her assigned counselor \"often cancelled appointments without rescheduling.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 160-61). For several months following the assault, Jane Doe 15 was \"unable to be by herself\" and experienced panic attacks and anxiety. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 167). After her counselor, Patty Crawford, resigned from her role at Baylor in Fall 2016, Jane Doe 15 was \"unable to cope and suicidal.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 163). When Jane Doe 15 informed Baylor's Title IX office of her struggles, they encouraged her to \"move on, push through, and to get over it.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 168). Although Jane Doe 15 held academic scholarships prior to her assault, her experience since the assault has required her to delay graduation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 135, 164). Since her assault, Jane Doe 15 has experienced great mental distress that interferes with her daily routine and has hindered her ability to find work post-graduation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 170). Jane Doe 15 alleges that Baylor's actions and inactions have caused her severe physical and mental health impairments that continue today. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 172). She alleges that Baylor's lack of knowledgeable staff and the \"non-existence\" of a Title IX office substantially impaired her higher education experience and severely impaired her physical and mental health. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 173).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In addition to the specific facts alleged above, Plaintiffs note that Baylor did not have a full-time Title IX coordinator until November 2014. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 42). Moreover, despite the assaults reported to Baylor by Plaintiffs and others, Baylor claimed to the U.S. Department of Education that zero incidents of sexual assault took place on its campus between 2008 and 2011.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 35).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

The recognition of this private right of action has given rise to two general avenues for Title IX claims. The distinction between these two avenues-one for claims based on an official policy of discrimination and another for claims based on an institution's actual notice of and deliberate indifference to sexual harassment or assault-is particularly relevant here because Plaintiffs use both to advance their claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The first avenue for claims under Title IX is based on institution's official policy of intentional discrimination.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Franklin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6220380\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/503/60/\">\n    503 U.S. at 75\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6220380\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/503/60/\">\n    112 S.Ct. 1028\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (distinguishing claims alleging \"intentional discrimination\" by an institution from those claims seeking to hold an institution liable for the discriminatory acts of an individual);\n   <em>\n    Gebser v.

The Supreme Court has held that sexual harassment within a school or school program is a form of sex discrimination when the harassment is \"so severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive\" that it deprives the victim of educational opportunities or benefits provided by the school.\n   <em>\n    Davis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11133593\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/526/629/#p683\">\n    526 U.S. at 650\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11133593\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/526/629/#p683\">\n    119 S.Ct. 1661\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

This framework for liability in sexual harassment cases ultimately serves as a proxy for the showing of intentional discrimination that is otherwise required for Title IX claims. Thus, while the school is not itself committing the sexual harassment, it can be said to be intentionally discriminating if it knows of severe and pervasive sexual harassment occurring within its control and, for example, does nothing.\n   <em>\n    Gebser\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11182276\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/524/274/#p290\">\n    524 U.S. at 290\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11182276\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/524/274/#p290\">\n    118 S.Ct. 1989\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   It is with these two avenues in mind that the Court now turns to consider Plaintiffs' claims. First, Plaintiffs here allege what might be considered a \"traditional\" claim for sexual assault under Title IX. They each argue that they were sexually assaulted by a peer at Baylor, that they reported their assault to the university, and that Baylor's deliberately indifferent response to each of their reports deprived them of educational opportunities and benefits provided by the school. The Court will refer to these as Plaintiffs' \"post-reporting claims.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Second, Plaintiffs allege that even before their initial reports of sexual assault, Baylor's discriminatory practices in handling reports of sexual assault-discouraging victims from reporting their assaults and failing to investigate their claims or punish their assailants-constituted a policy of intentional discrimination that substantially increased Plaintiffs' risk of being sexually assaulted. The Court will refer to these as Plaintiffs' \"heightened-risk claims.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Baylor moves to dismiss all of Plaintiffs' Title IX claims. The Court will first address whether Plaintiffs have plausibly alleged each of these claims and then consider whether any plausibly alleged claim is barred by the applicable statute of limitations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Post-Reporting Sexual Harassment or Assault\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Each Plaintiff alleges that Baylor was deliberately indifferent to her reports of sexual assault, thereby causing her further sexual assault or harassment or creating a hostile educational environment.

Although Baylor contends that its investigations were prompt and reasonable, Plaintiffs allege facts which, assumed to be true, would demonstrate otherwise. Plaintiffs allege that when they reported that they had been raped, Baylor discouraged them from reporting their assaults, (Am.

(Def.'s Mot. Dismiss Doe 12, Dkt. 20, at 15; Def.'s Mot. Dismiss Doe 14, Dkt. 22, at 15; Def.'s Mot. Dismiss Doe 15, Dkt. 23, at 17). Baylor's analogy of Plaintiffs' claims to \"demanding a new desk assignment\" profoundly understates the seriousness of Plaintiffs' claims. (Def.'s Mot. Dismiss Doe 12, Dkt. 20, at 16; Def.'s Mot. Dismiss Doe 14, Dkt. 22, at 14; Def.'s Mot. Dismiss Doe 15, Dkt. 23, at 16). Plaintiffs argue that Baylor's actions and inactions after they reported their assaults denied Plaintiffs the benefits of, and subjected them to discrimination in their education at Baylor on the basis of their sex. (Am. Compl., Dkt. 14, at \u00b6 177). Specifically, Plaintiffs allege that even after receiving detailed, numerous reports of sexual assault, \"high-level, policy-setting\" Baylor employees and officials \"did not cause any change in the sexually hostile environment at the University.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 38-39). Instead, Plaintiffs allege that Baylor discouraged them from reporting their assaults, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , at \u00b6\u00b6 55-57, 81, 111, 180), failed to adequately investigate each of the assaults, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 31-32), misled and lied to Plaintiffs about their options for reporting and accommodations, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 40), and obstructed Plaintiffs' access to medical and mental health treatment, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 44, 61-62, 81, 88, 158-61).

Baylor attempts to dismiss these allegations as a list of \"remedial demands.\" (Def.'s Mot.

However, Plaintiffs do not assert a \" 'stand-alone claim\" for particular remedies or accommodations. (Reply Doe 12, Dkt. 29, at 9).

While allegations of further assault or harassment are necessary for a claim under Title IX, the Supreme Court has made clear that to \"subject\" a student to harassment a school need only make the student vulnerable to that harassment.\n   <em>\n    Davis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11133593\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/526/629/#p683\">\n    526 U.S. at 645\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11133593\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/526/629/#p683\">\n    119 S.Ct. 1661\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

First, each Plaintiff plausibly alleges that while she was at Baylor, she was sexually assaulted by another student. (Am. Compl., Dkt. 14., \u00b6\u00b6 50, 68, 78-79, 84-85, 96, 136). Second, each Plaintiff alleges she reported her assault or assaults to the Baylor counseling center, the Baylor police department, the Title IX office, or another student services office. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 54, 80, 86, 96, 110, 140-43).

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 60-63, 68-72, 87-90, 92, 113-14, 143-51, 153-57, 159-61, 168-69). Each Plaintiff also alleges that \"high-level, policy-setting\" Baylor employees and officials received detailed, numerous reports of sexual assault, but still \"did not cause any change in the sexually hostile environment at the University.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 38-39). Instead, each Plaintiff alleges Baylor discouraged her from reporting her assault(s), (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 55-57, 81, 111, 180), misled and lied to Plaintiffs about their options for reporting and accommodations, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 40, 75, 81, 111, 146-49), and obstructed Plaintiffs' access to medical and mental health treatment, (i\n   <em>\n    d.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 44, 61-62, 81, 88, 158-61).

Heightened Risk of Sexual Harassment or Assault\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Plaintiffs also claim that Baylor's handling of reports of sexual assaults created a heightened risk of sexual assault throughout the university's student body. Plaintiffs allege Baylor knew of and permitted a \"campus condition rife with sexual assault,\" (Am.

Plaintiffs allege that Baylor's failure to properly investigate sexual assaults chilled reporting and \"substantially increased\" the risk that Plaintiffs and others would be sexually assaulted. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1; \u00b6 36). Further, they allege that Baylor engaged in \"a pattern and practice of behavior designed to discourage and dissuade students ... who had been sexually assaulted from seeking prosecution and protection.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 180).

Jane Doe 12, Jane Doe 14, and Jane Doe 15 each allege that they were sexually assaulted by another student at Baylor in 2016. (Am. Compl., Dkt. 14, \u00b6\u00b6 50, 106, 136). Jane Doe 13 alleges that she that she was sexually assaulted three times-in April 2012, in Fall 2012, and during a study abroad program at some time before November 2014.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 78, 84, 96). Baylor moves to dismiss Jane Doe 13's claims as time-barred under the two-year statute of limitations. (Def.'s Mot. Dismiss Doe 13, Dkt. 21, at 11-18). However, Jane Doe 13 contends she \"had no notice of the Baylor's policies, procedures and customs that created the heightened risk environment until at least the [Pepper Hamilton Findings of Fact] were released.\" (Resp. Doe 13, Dkt. 26, at 12). Considering the same question in\n   <em>\n    Jane Doe 1, et al. v. Baylor Univ.\n   </em>\n   , this Court found it plausible that the plaintiffs in that case had no reason to further investigate their heightened-risk claims until the release of Baylor's Findings of Fact and the subsequent media coverage in 2016.\n   <em>\n    Doe 1\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12267835\" index=\"139\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/240/646/#p660\">\n    240 F.Supp.3d at 663\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court reaches the same conclusion here. Taking Plaintiffs' allegations as true, the claims for heightened-risk liability for all four Plaintiffs did not accrue until Spring 2016-or until the time of their assault, for Plaintiffs who were assaulted later. Accordingly, the two-year statute of limitations for Plaintiffs' heightened-risk claims had not run by September 1, 2017, when this case was first filed.

All Plaintiffs allege they reported their sexual assault to Baylor personnel and that Baylor failed to adequately assist them, sometimes discouraging them from seeking further assistance. Because of this deliberately indifferent response, Plaintiffs allege, they were subjected to further harassment or assault or were otherwise deprived of educational opportunities to which they were entitled. Within some reasonable amount of time after their initial reports, Plaintiffs would have understood that Baylor's deliberate indifference to their reports was the cause of those post-reporting injuries or could reasonably have been expected to \"inquire further.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    King-White\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4347312\" index=\"140\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/803/754/#p759\">\n    803 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   761-63 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Samuelson v.

She alleges that she was sexually assaulted by another student three times while she was a student at Baylor: in April 2012, in Fall 2012, and during a study abroad program at some time before November 2014.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Am. Compl., Dkt. 14. \u00b6\u00b6 78, 84, 96). She alleges that she reported the first assault to the Baylor Counseling Center in Fall 2012, and the second assault to her counselor at the Counseling Center. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 80, 86). She also reported one or more assaults to a professor in 2014. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 91). Plaintiff does not state in the complaint whether she reported her third assault. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 96). However, Plaintiff's claim did not accrue until she was aware or had reason to know of Baylor's deliberately indifferent response to these reports. It is unclear from the face of the Complaint when this would have occurred. While it may have occurred in Fall 2012 following her first report, depending on the content and timing of her communications with Baylor, it is also possible that her claim did not accrue until later. However, even considering the latest date plausible on the face of the Complaint-when she reported to her professor in 2014 and became aware that she received a deliberately indifferent response-Jane Doe 13's post-reporting claim must have accrued at some time in 2014 or early 2015. Even allowing for an accrual of her claim in early 2015, the very latest plausible date, her two-year statute of limitations would have run by early 2017, before this case was filed on September 1, 2017. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl., Dkt. 1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Plaintiffs incorporate their arguments regarding tolling and the continuing violation doctrine from their submissions in\n   <em>\n    Jane Doe 1, et al. v.

There, Plaintiffs argued the Court should toll the statute of limitations or apply the continuing violation doctrine to these claims.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, the Court reaches the same conclusion in this case that neither tolling nor the continuing violation doctrine is applicable to Jane Doe 13's claims. First, tolling is unavailable to Plaintiffs under Texas law. Jane Doe 13 cannot take advantage of Texas' discovery rule because she have provided no explanation as to her their injuries were \"inherently undiscoverable.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    King-White\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4347312\" index=\"142\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/803/754/#p759\">\n    803 F.3d at 764\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Nor can she take advantage of the equitable tolling doctrines she invoke-fraudulent concealment and equitable estoppel-because, again, Plaintiffs have not alleged any facts from which the Court can reasonably infer that they could not have \"discovered\" their post-reporting causes of action in the exercise of due diligence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Owen v.

The latest date she specifies in the Amended Complaint is the report to her professor at some time in 2014. Without any facts for the Court to consider, the Court cannot find that a series of related acts extended the limitations period. Thus, even if the Court were to decide that the continuing violation doctrine applied\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   and that the doctrine extended Baylor's violation to the furthest imaginable reach, such as the date when a plaintiff left Baylor,\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   Jane Doe 13 has alleged no facts for the Court to make that determination.

Jane Doe 14 alleges that she was assaulted in student housing owned by Baylor. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 109). While Does 13 and 14 allege they were sexually assaulted on Baylor's campus or in the context of a Baylor-operated program, they have not alleged that Baylor failed to meet its duty to provide them with safe housing, thereby causing their assaults, nor have they provided any other exception to the general rule that a university has no duty to protect its students. As to Jane Doe 12 and Jane Doe 15, a Texas Court of Appeals has already specifically considered and rejected the proposition that universities have a duty to protect adult students from the criminal acts of other students while off-campus.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Boyd\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11493573\" index=\"167\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/8/758/#p760\">\n    8 S.W.3d at 760\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Duty to Adequately Hire, Train, and Supervise Employees\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Next, Plaintiffs argue that Baylor breached its duty, as an employer, to adequately hire, train, and supervise employees. While Plaintiffs are correct that such a duty exists in the general sense,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Castillo v.

App.-Houston [1st Dist.] 1999, pet. denied) (\"An employer has a duty to adequately hire, train, and supervise employees.\"), they fail to identify how Baylor breached this duty.

The Court therefore grants\n   Baylor's motion to dismiss Plaintiffs' claims for negligence to the extent they are premised on Baylor's breach of a duty to hire, train, or supervise its employees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Other Duties\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Plaintiffs argue that Baylor breached a number of other alleged duties of reasonable care. For example, they allege Baylor breached a duty of reasonable care by failing to adopt sexual education programs to promote awareness of rape, acquaintance rape, and other sex crimes, and by failing to adopt and enforce procedures for students to follow should they be sexually assaulted. (Am. Compl., Dkt. 14, \u00b6 185(j), (l) ). They also argue that Baylor breached a reasonable duty of care by failing to provide meaningful assistance and accommodation for victims of sexual assault, and by failing to ensure student conduct rules were enforced in a way that was not sexually discriminatory. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 185(s)-(t) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   While the Court appreciates Plaintiffs' submissions, Plaintiffs have not identified any legal basis for the argument that these actions were required under any standard of reasonable care applicable to Baylor under state law.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hux\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4252588\" index=\"171\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/819/776/#p780\">\n    819 F.3d at 783\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (applying Texas law and holding that no special relationship giving rise to a duty existed in an \"ordinary student-administrator relationship,\" even where a university \"[e]ncourag[ed] students to take advantage of university mental-health resources, counsel[ed] students, and offer[ed] help to students struggling through disciplinary problems\"). The Court therefore grants Baylor's motion to dismiss Plaintiffs' remaining negligence claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Breach of Contract\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Finally, Plaintiffs also allege they had \"valid enforceable contracts with [Baylor] as academic enrollees and also as residents living in on-campus housing,\" that Baylor breached these contracts by failing to adequately warn Plaintiffs of the risk of sexual assault on campus and by failing to provide an adequately safe living and educational environment, and that Plaintiffs suffered foreseeable damages as a result of these breaches. (Am. Compl., Dkt. 14, \u00b6\u00b6 188-91). Baylor responds that Plaintiffs failed to identify an enforceable contract or to identify the specific provisions of the purported contract which were allegedly breached. (Def.'s Mot. Dismiss Doe 12, Dkt. 20, at 19-20; Def.'s Mot. Dismiss Doe 12, Dkt. 21, at 19-20; Def.'s Mot. Dismiss Doe 14, Dkt. 22, at 19-20; Def.'s Mot. Dismiss Doe 15, Dkt. 23, at 20).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   The Court agrees that Plaintiffs do not adequately allege breach of contract. \"A breach of contract ... only occurs when a party fails or refuses to perform an act that it expressly promised to do.\"\n   <em>\n    Innova Hosp.

But Plaintiffs do not identify the terms or obligations of the purportedly breached contract, nor do they suggest what document or documents comprise that contract. Without these factual allegations, Plaintiffs' breach of contract claim does not provide Baylor with the fair notice of their claim required by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Twombly\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556136\" index=\"174\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/544/#p555\">\n    550 U.S. at 555\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556136\" index=\"175\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/544/#p555\">\n    127 S.Ct. 1955\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The Amended Complaint identifies three different assailants: Assailant 14 in April 2012, (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at \u00b6 78), Assailant 15 in Fall 2012, (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at \u00b6 84), and \"Assailant 16\" during a Baylor study abroad program, (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at \u00b6 96). However, the Amended Complaint states that the assault during the study abroad program was a second assault by the second assailant. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at \u00b6 96). For this reason, the Court construes the reference to \"Assailant 16\" as a clerical error, and reads \u00b6 96 as describing a second assault by Assailant 15. The identity of the alleged assailant does not alter Jane Doe 13's underlying factual claim: that even after she reported a sexual assault to Baylor staff and raised concerns about a specific fellow student, that student was permitted to participate on the same study abroad program.
