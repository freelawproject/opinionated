(ECF No. 16.) The Court found that Plaintiff stated a cognizable claim for excessive force against Defendants Helling, Gunn, and Graham and a failure to intervene claim against Defendant Hellmuth arising out of allegations that Plaintiff was assaulted on August 6, 2015. Plaintiff also stated a cognizable claim for excessive force against Defendant Villegas arising out of events on November 26, 2015. Plaintiff failed to state any other cognizable claims. Plaintiff was informed that claims regarding the events of August 6, 2015 and claims regarding the events of November 26, 2015 were improperly joined in this action. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On December 14, 2017, Plaintiff filed a motion for clarification of the Court's screening order, requesting that the Court consider the prejudice to Plaintiff by dismissing this action rather than severing the improperly joined claims, due to potential statute of limitation issues. (ECF No. 17.) On December 18, 2017, the Court issued an order granting the motion. (ECF No. 18.) The order explained that Plaintiff must file a first amended complaint to pursue claims in this action, and at that time the Court would conduct the appropriate prejudice analysis and address the disposition of any improperly joined claims.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court extended the deadline for Plaintiff to file a first amended complaint until thirty days following service of that order. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On January 8, 2018, Plaintiff filed a notice of appeal. (ECF No. 19.) As no final order had been entered in this action, the Court treated Plaintiff's appeal as an interlocutory appeal. Thus, when Plaintiff failed to file a first amended complaint within the allotted time, the Court issued findings and recommendations recommending dismissal\n   of this action, without prejudice, due to Plaintiff's failure to obey a court order and failure to prosecute. (ECF No. 22.) Plaintiff timely filed objections on February 9, 2018, arguing that he believed, in good faith, that the filing of his notice of appeal divested the Court of jurisdiction over this action, and therefore he was not required to file an amended complaint. (ECF No. 23.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   On February 27, 2018, the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit issued an order dismissing Plaintiff's appeal for lack of jurisdiction because the orders challenged in the appeal were not final or appealable. (ECF No. 24.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In light of Plaintiff's\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   status and the filing of his notice of appeal, the Court found it appropriate to vacate its findings and recommendations and granted Plaintiff a final opportunity to file a first amended complaint. (ECF No. 25.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   On May 14, 2018, Plaintiff filed a motion again requesting that the Court sever any claims it considers improperly joined in the original complaint, in consideration of the prejudicial impact of requiring Plaintiff to file a first amended complaint. (ECF No. 27.) Plaintiff further requests that the Court issue an order directing prison officials at the institution where he was recently transferred to provide Plaintiff with his legal property, specifically a copy of his original complaint. The Court construes this request as a motion for preliminary injunctive relief. Finally, Plaintiff requests a thirty-day continuance due to his lack of legal property. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Upon further consideration and review of Plaintiff's motion, it is apparent that Plaintiff does not wish to file a first amended complaint to correct the deficiencies identified in the Court's prior screening order, including the improper joinder of claims. Therefore, the Court VACATES the November 17, 2017 screening order, (ECF No. 16), and issues the following Amended Screening Order and Findings and Recommendations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Associate Warden Snider informed Plaintiff that the handicap accessible cell in the SHU was inoperable and that was all of the assistive devices that Plaintiff was getting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   On August 4, 2015, Plaintiff again spoke to Associate Warden Snider about access to a handicap accessible toilet and shower. Plaintiff informed Associate Warden Snider that prisons are required to provide handicap accessible showers and toilets pursuant to Supreme Court opinion. Associate Warden Snider again informed Plaintiff that cell #112 was inoperable and there were no other handicap accessible cells available.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   On August 6, 2015, Plaintiff and his cellmate were ordered to pack in order to move to cell #112. Plaintiff immediately inquired as to the operability of the cell, but staff members did not know. Approximately 20 minutes later, Plaintiff and his cellmate were transferred to cell #112. Upon entering the cell, Plaintiff saw why the Associate Warden informed him that the cell was inoperable. The shower was broken, with the handicap seat dangling attached to strips of torn sheets. Plaintiff began to protest that not only did the cell not accommodate his disability, but it also posed a clear hazard to his safety. At this point, Lieutenant Helling told Plaintiff that he was getting sick of his complaining. Plaintiff countered that the cell was out of compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act. Lieutenant Helling told Plaintiff that he either went into cell #112 or back to his previous cell. Plaintiff verbally objected to both. Lieutenant Helling then told Plaintiff's cellmate to step out of the cell and that he did not need to be a part of what was going to happen to Plaintiff. Plaintiff was then left alone in cell #112 while restrained in handcuffs. About 10 minutes later, Lieutenant Helling returned\n   and informed Plaintiff that someone from the facilities department was coming to fix the shower and he was temporarily placing Plaintiff in another cell while the cell was being fixed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Plaintiff was wheeled to another cell and pushed inside, where he remained strapped in the restraint chair in handcuffs. After about 30-40 minutes, the facility worker was standing outside Plaintiff's cell. Plaintiff asked if he fixed the shower. The facility worker informed Plaintiff that he was unable to fix the shower properly and he would need a new shower seat. About 5 minutes later, Lieutenant Helling returned and ordered his staff to wheel Plaintiff to cell #112. Plaintiff verbally objected, informing Lieutenant Helling what the facility worker told him and demanding the basic necessities of a handicap accessible toilet and shower. Lieutenant Helling ordered Correctional Officer Graham to remove the straps that were restraining Plaintiff to the restraint chair. Once the straps were removed, Lieutenant Helling ordered Plaintiff to get out of the chair while still handcuffed and enter the cell. Plaintiff refused, reiterating his request for handicap accommodations. Lieutenant Helling and Officer Graham then lifted Plaintiff out of the chair and walked him into the center of the cell where Correctional Office W. Gunn waited. Plaintiff was turned around to face the entrance of the cell. Seconds after Plaintiff stopped walking, Lieutenant Helling and Correctional Officers Gunn and Graham began to punch Plaintiff in the back and the side of his head with closed fists. After numerous punches, Lieutenant Helling slammed Plaintiff on the ground and all three started kicking Plaintiff repeatedly in the leg and side torso until Lieutenant Helling yelled at them to stop. During the assault, Correctional Officer Hellmuth stood at the entrance of the cell doorway and watched. Plaintiff alleges that Defendant Hellmuth failed to act to protect him from the assault.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Once the assault stopped, Lieutenant Helling ordered Correctional Officer Hellmuth to get some shackles and a camera. Plaintiff was then placed in the restraint chair, strapped in and wheeled to see a nurse. Plaintiff immediately told the nurse that he had been assaulted. While detailing the assault, the nurse told the officers to get him out of there because he was being uncooperative. Plaintiff contends that he received no medical attention, though he was in great pain. Plaintiff was then wheeled back to cell #112 and placed on the floor of the cell still restrained, where he was left for a couple of hours.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Plaintiff asserts that Warden Matevousian was aware that Plaintiff had been complaining daily of the confiscation of his assistive devices and lack of access to a handicap toilet and shower. Warden Matevousian also was aware that Captain Garcia had assembled numerous use-of-force teams that were used for movement to and from the shower area as well as the housing units. Plaintiff alleges that the Warden knew or should have known, or was deliberately indifferent to the situation that Plaintiff was complaining about and that this may lead to the assault. Plaintiff further alleges that Warden Matevousian has a duty to protect inmates from staff abuse once he becomes aware that there is an ongoing problem between staff and an inmate. Plaintiff contends that the Warden failed to act to prevent an escalation of events that resulted in Plaintiff being assaulted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Plaintiff further alleges that Captain Garcia created the atmosphere that led to Plaintiff's assault. Plaintiff contends that Captain Garcia assembled a use of force team to greet Plaintiff upon his arrival at Atwater and immediately confiscated his assistive devices. Plaintiff also contends\n   that Captain Garcia assembled 3-4 use of force teams against Plaintiff, and by August 6, 2015, it was widely known by prison staff that Plaintiff was a problem inmate. Plaintiff alleges that Captain Garcia knew or should have known or was deliberately indifferent that his orders to staff to assemble use of force teams to deal with a handicapped inmate was a potentially serious situation that may lead to Plaintiff being assaulted by staff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <em>\n    Claim 2\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   In claim 2, Plaintiff alleges that on November 26, 2015, he was assaulted by Correctional Officer G. Villegas. After the assault, a lieutenant responded to Plaintiff's location to take photographs of his injured left hand. The next morning, paramedic staff Stacey Vasquez responded to Plaintiff's cell to assess his injured hand. Without looking at his hand, Paramedic Vasquez informed Plaintiff that he would be placed on the list for x-rays and to see the doctor. Several days later, Plaintiff was transported to the x-ray department, but no x-ray was taken. The x-ray tech claimed that her paperwork reflected that it was Plaintiff's right hand that was injured and that she was only authorized to x-ray his right hand. The next day, Plaintiff informed Paramedic Vasquez about the x-ray. Paramedic Vasquez informed Plaintiff that she would submit the request again reflecting his left hand. Plaintiff alleges that he never received any x-ray of his left hand or any treatment for it. Plaintiff informed the Western and Regional Offices that he had been denied medical treatment, but both offices failed to act on his written complaints.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <em>\n    Claim 3\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   In claim 3, Plaintiff alleges that on November 26, 2015, he was assaulted by Correctional Officer G. Villegas during the dinnertime meal. Plaintiff contends that he was standing at his cell door with his hand on the open food port door attempting to complain to Correctional Officer Villegas about the quantity of his meal. Realizing that his attempt to informally resolve the issue was futile, Plaintiff requested to speak to the on-duty lieutenant or duty officer. Officer Villegas became upset that Plaintiff was requesting to speak to his supervisor. Officer Villegas told Plaintiff that he was not talking to anyone and ordered Plaintiff to remove his hand from the door or he would break it. Plaintiff told Officer Villegas that he was not going to remove his hand until he spoke with the Lieutenant as he believed that Officer Villegas had tampered with the quantity of his meal. Officer Villegas then slammed up the tray door, smashing Plaintiff's hand between the tray door and the cell door. Plaintiff began screaming, while Officer Villegas continued to apply pressure. After about a minute and a half, Officer Villegas let the tray door fall over, looked through the tray door into the cell and snatched Plaintiff's walking cane, causing Plaintiff to fall to the ground. Plaintiff asked to see medical for his hand and to speak with the Lieutenant. Officer Villegas snatched the cane out of the cell and shouted that he was going to write Plaintiff up for assaulting him with the cane. Officer Villegas then closed the tray door and exited with the cane.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <strong>\n    1.

So it seems clear that Congress had specific occasion to consider the matter of prisoner abuse and to consider the proper way to remedy those wrongs. This Court has said in dicta that the Act's exhaustion provisions would apply to\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   suits. But the Act itself does not provide for a standalone damages remedy against federal jailers. It could be argued that this suggests Congress chose not to extend the\n   <em>\n    Carlson\n   </em>\n   damages remedy to cases involving other types of prisoner mistreatment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12604999\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1843/#p1857\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (internal citations omitted).

In light of the Court's findings above, the Court cannot find that Plaintiff has shown a likelihood of success on the merits. In addition, no defendant has been ordered served, and no defendant has yet made an appearance. Thus, the Court lacks personal jurisdiction over any prison officials at U.S. Penitentiary Canaan, and it cannot issue an order requiring them to take any action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Conclusion and Order\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Plaintiff's complaint fails to state any cognizable claims for relief. Despite being provided with the relevant pleading and legal standards, as well as multiple opportunities to file a first amended complaint in compliance with such standards, Plaintiff has been unable and unwilling to cure the deficiencies by amendment. In light of Plaintiff's repeated refusals to file an amended complaint and the above analysis pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Ziglar\n   </em>\n   , further leave to amend would be futile and is not warranted.\n   <em>\n    Lopez v.
