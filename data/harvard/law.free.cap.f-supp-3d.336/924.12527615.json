Petitioners are law firms with principal places of business in Cook County, Illinois specializing in the prosecution of\n   <em>\n    qui tam\n   </em>\n   litigation, which involves filing claims under state and federal false claims statutes in the hopes of receiving a portion of the recovery.

At all relevant times, Petitioners have had an agreement to work jointly as \"Whistleblower Advocates\" in false claims and\n   <em>\n    qui tam\n   </em>\n   cases. (Award at PageID # :39). Beginning in December 2013, Respondent Kenneth Elder engaged in discussions with Petitioners to represent him and G3 Analytics, LLC (\"G3\"), a limited liability company owned by Elder, to pursue certain\n   <em>\n    qui tam\n   </em>\n   actions related to failure to surrender unclaimed property as required by state law. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Respondents are \"professional\n   <em>\n    qui tam\n   </em>\n   plaintiffs,\" also known as relators, who \"identify[ ], develop[ ], and fil[e] claims ... using federal and state False Claims statutes.\" (Am. Pet. \u00b6 2.) The parties ultimately entered into an Engagement and Fee Agreement in March 2014 (\"the Agreement\") governing the terms of Petitioners' representation of Respondents in the contemplated unclaimed property litigation. (Award at PageID # :39, 41; Agreement (Dkt. No. 9-2).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   As relevant here, the Agreement sets forth an Attorneys' Fees and Costs section that generally states that the Petitioners will work on a \"contingency fee basis,\" unless Respondents terminate representation or withdraw as set forth in paragraphs 8 and 9 of the agreement. (Agreement \u00b6 4.) Paragraph 9 of the agreement, entitled the Client Withdrawal clause, states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   In the event our Law Firms [Petitioners] are willing to proceed with the Unclaimed Property Litigation and you [Respondents] determine to withdraw, you agree to pay our Law Firms for all costs and expenses we have incurred, plus fees incurred to the date of your withdrawal ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9.) Finally, the Agreement contains an Alternative Dispute Resolution (\"ADR\") provision stating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   Any disputes relating to this Agreement ... will be resolved by alternate dispute resolution. Alternative dispute resolution means that you and our Law Firms agree to submit all disputes to an independent mediator mutually agreed upon.... In the event the parties are unable to resolve their disputes through mediation, the parties agree that the mediator shall require the parties to submit their disputes to an independent arbitrator selected by the mediator. The mediator will have the right to appoint himself as arbitrator in that proceeding. The parties shall be bound by the decision of the arbitrator and such decision shall be final and not subject to review\n   except as to the issue of malfeasance or bias on the part of the arbitrator.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   At all relevant times, Respondents were parties to a consulting agreement with a third party, Total Assets Recovery System (\"TARS\"), \"an organization of attorneys that were relators in\n   <em>\n    qui tam\n   </em>\n   actions regarding unremitted life insurance proceeds.\" (Award at PageID # :39.) The parties were concerned about the \"effect of the TARS consulting agreement on the potential litigation under discussion,\" and the parties agreed that TARS' involvement in the contemplated unclaimed property filings would cause an \"ethical conflict\" and would \"bankrupt the litigation.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at PageID # :41.) The parties initially agreed that TARS had no claim to the litigation contemplated by the parties. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Accordingly, for a number of months in 2014, Petitioners investigated and worked on Respondents' claims and were ready to file lawsuits in Illinois and Delaware by June 2014. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Before filing, however, Petitioners decided to verify that TARS would not assert an interest in the litigation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In July 2014, based on discussions with TARS, Elder informed Petitioners that TARS \"insisted on asserting its interest\" in the anticipated unclaimed property cases. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at PageID # :42.) Petitioners requested Elder to arrange a meeting with TARS to try to establish a way to advance the\n   <em>\n    qui tam\n   </em>\n   claims; Elder never acted upon the request. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at PageID # :46.) At that time, Steven Cohen \"requested a written waiver from TARS before filing the contemplated action.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at PageID # :39, 41.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Apparently concerned about TARS' interference, Respondents notified Petitioners by email on August 13, 2014 that they were \"exercising [their] option to withdraw (item # 9) from our engagement and fee agreement.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; Resp. (Dkt. No. 12) at 5 (\"Elder chose not to pay off TARS or proceed with the litigation.\").) On September 14, 2014, Petitioners sent Respondents a bill for $233,597.26 in legal expenses, which remains unpaid. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   When Respondents did not pay the $233,597.26 invoice, Petitioners demanded mediation pursuant to the ADR clause of the Agreement. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In response, on April 6, 2015, Respondents filed suit in the Circuit Court of Cook County seeking a declaratory judgment that the Agreement was unenforceable. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at PageID # :42.)\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    G3 Analytics, LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20IL%20App%20%281st%29%20160369\">\n    2016 IL App (1st) 160369\n   </extracted-citation>\n   \u00b6 5,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=409%20Ill.%20Dec.%20485\">\n    409 Ill.Dec. 485\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=67%20N.E.3d%20940\">\n    67 N.E.3d at 943\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Respondents contended that (1) the Agreement was not binding because it was negotiated without an \"arm's-length bargaining process,\" (2) the Agreement \"became unenforceable\" when Respondents \"terminated [Petitioners'] representation,\" (3) the ADR clause in the Agreement \"violated public policy,\" and (4) the ADR clause \"became unenforceable by allowing the mediator to appoint him or herself as arbitrator.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=67%20N.E.3d%20940\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The trial court ultimately dismissed the complaint and compelled arbitration, and the Appellate Court of Illinois affirmed.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=67%20N.E.3d%20940\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20IL%20App%20%281st%29%20160369\">\n    2016 IL App (1st) 160369\n   </extracted-citation>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 8-9,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=409%20Ill.%20Dec.%20485\">\n    409 Ill.Dec. 485\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=67%20N.E.3d%20940\">\n    67 N.E.3d at 944-45\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The parties then held an unsuccessful mediation pursuant to the terms of the Agreement, and proceeded to arbitration, which occurred on September 19 and 20, 2017 before the Arbitrator, retired Judge Susan Zwick. (Award at PageID # :38.) The arbitration included discovery, two days of evidentiary hearings, and post-hearing briefing. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) On December 21,\n   2017, the Arbitrator issued the Award, finding that Petitioners were entitled to recover $233,597.26 in attorneys' fees and costs from Respondents based on paragraph 9 of the Agreement. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at PageID # :46-47.) In issuing the Award, the arbitrator considered and rejected Respondents' arguments that the Agreement was unenforceable based on alleged violations of the Illinois Rules of Professional Conduct. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at Page ID # :42-45 (outlining Respondents' arguments that the Agreement violated Illinois Rules of Professional Conduct 1.5(a), 1.5(e), and 1.8 ).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On April 19, 2018,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Petitioners filed an amended petition to confirm the Award pursuant to \u00a7 9 of the FAA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Petitioners claim that \"Respondents have refused to comply with the arbitrator's Award,\" and request an order confirming the $233,597.26 Award along with a judgment \"in conformity with that Order.\" (Am. Pet. \u00b6\u00b6 14, 16.) In response, Respondents argue the Award \"is against clear public policy and cannot be enforced,\" because Petitioners allegedly \"coerce[d]\" Respondents, their clients, in violation of the Rules of Professional Conduct. (Resp. at 1, 10-14 (citing Ill. R. of Prof'l Conduct 1.2(a), 1.3, 1.5(b)-(c), and 1.8(b) ).) Respondents request we conduct a de novo review to determine \"whether the contractual award as interpreted by the arbitrator violates some explicit public policy.\" (Resp. at 9.) Alternately, Respondents urge us to deny $51,595.00 of the award owed to Cohen Law specifically. Respondents claim Cohen Law engaged in \"egregious client coercion\" when Steven Cohen represented that Cohen Law would not initiate litigation until Respondents received a written release from TARS, which Respondents argue would have cost a significant amount of money and put Respondents \"over a barrel.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2, 5, 14-15 (calling Cohen's written waiver request to be a \"threat\" that constituted \"coercion against respondents to an even higher degree\").)

PUBLIC POLICY CHALLENGE\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Respondents nevertheless argue that public policy concerns pursuant to \u00a7 2 of the FAA preclude the confirmation of the arbitration award. (Resp. at 1; Surreply (Dkt. No. 15-1).) Respondents allege Petitioners \"coerce[d] [their] client to take an action to improve profitability of [a] contingent case, under the threat that otherwise the contingency counsel will refuse to file the case and charge the client $233,000 in hourly fees.\" (Resp. at 1.) Specifically, Respondents suggest that Petitioners required they meet with a third party, TARS, and apparently wanted Respondents to pay TARS a sum of money to waive their interest in the contemplated litigation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Respondents argue this \"coercion against a client violates five separate Illinois Rules of Professional Conduct,\" specifically Rules 1.2(a), 1.3, 1.5(b)-(c), and 1.8(b). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1, 9-14.) As the Rules of Professional Conduct have the force of law, Respondents argue Petitioners' actions thus go against \"clear public policy\" and render the Award of legal fees unenforceable.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1.) Respondents claim we should conduct a de novo review of the record and decide whether the Award is contrary to public policy based on \u00a7 2 of the FAA. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7-8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Section 2 allows courts to refuse to enforce arbitration agreements \"upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.\" 9 U.S.C \u00a7 2. Respondents do not assert their public policy arguments fall under the \u00a7\u00a7 10 or 11 grounds for vacation or amendment of an award and admit \u00a7\u00a7 10 and 11\"do not mention public policy at all.\" (Resp\n   <em>\n    .\n   </em>\n   at 8.) Instead, they represent that challenges to an arbitration award under \u00a7 2 should be considered a \"prerequisite\" to enforcement under \u00a7 9. (Surreply at 4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   In reply to Respondents' public policy argument, Petitioners argue that Respondents are barred from challenging the validity of the Award based on public policy because the three-month statute of limitations period under \u00a7 12 expired in March\n   2018, months before Respondents raised their present protestations about the validity of the Award itself. (Reply at 2 (Dkt. No. 13) (\"The Award has not been vacated, modified or corrected, and it is too late to do so now.\").) Citing our limited scope of review at this stage, Petitioners further assert that Respondents cannot rely on \u00a7 2 of the FAA to argue against confirmation pursuant to \u00a7 9, as \u00a7\u00a7 10 and 11 of the FAA provide the only grounds upon which the Court may vacate or modify the Award. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4 (citing\n   <extracted-citation index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=9%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%209\">\n    9 U.S.C. \u00a7 9\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (requiring the court to enter an order confirming an award \"unless the award is vacated, modified, or corrected as prescribed in sections 10 and 11 of this title.\") ).) Petitioners also point out that this is the third time Respondents have attempted to void the Agreement and avoid liability for the legal fees at issue, as they have raised this argument about the Agreement's unenforceability to the Cook County Circuit Court, the Illinois Appellate Court,\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   and to the Arbitrator. (Reply at 7 (indicating that the Arbitrator found the Agreement was \"not violative of public policy, and is enforceable\") (emphasis removed) (citing Award at PageID # :45) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   We agree with Petitioners that Respondents cannot avoid confirmation of the Award based on public policy concerns. First, \u00a7 12 of the FAA clearly requires any party wishing to \"vacate, modify, or correct an award\" to serve notice of that motion \"within three months after the award is filed or delivered.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=9%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2012\">\n    9 U.S.C. \u00a7 12\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The parties do not contest that Respondents did not file any motion to vacate, modify, or correct the Award within the three-month window. Considering the Award was issued on December 21, 2017, the three-month limitations period has long since expired, and Respondents can no longer challenge the enforceability of the award.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Respondents argue that public policy arguments under \u00a7 2 have no time limits because public policy grounds are not mentioned in \u00a7\u00a7 10 and 11. They claim public policy arguments can be raised at any time as a \"prerequisite\" to confirmation of an arbitration award. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Surreply at 4-6 (\"Illegal awards do not get more legal with the passage of time.\").) Section 12, however, does not only apply to motions to vacate or modify pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 10 and 11. Instead, the language of \u00a7 12 is broad and applies to\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   \"motion to vacate, modify, or correct an award\" under the FAA, including defenses raised against petitions to confirm awards.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cigna Ins.
