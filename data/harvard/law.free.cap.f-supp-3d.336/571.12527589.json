The parties disagree, however, as to construction of eight terms in the '303 and '028 Patents and submitted proposed constructions of those terms. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2-3.) Both parties submitted claim construction briefs, (Doc. 115 (Defendant); Doc. 118 (Plaintiff) ), and responsive briefs, (Doc. 127 (Defendant); Doc. 128 (Plaintiff) ). The court held a claim construction hearing on January 16, 2018, at which time the court took this matter under advisement. On May 29, 2018, this court requested supplemental briefing, (Doc. 139), which the parties thereafter filed, (Doc. 140 (Plaintiff); Doc. 141 (Defendant) ). On June 19, 2018, this court requested responses to the supplemental briefing, (Text Order 06/19/2018), which the parties thereafter filed, (Doc. 144 (Defendant); Doc. 146 (Plaintiff) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     LEGAL STANDARD\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Markman v.

Defendant advocates for a construction of \"carried on\" that is more limited than the term's plain meaning and which requires direct contact between the solid state light sources and the elongate member's outer surface. Unless an exception applies, it is generally error to adopt a construction which excludes a preferred embodiment.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    MBO Labs., Inc. v.

Because the specification contains a preferred embodiment which does not require direct contact, a person skilled in the relevant art would understand \"carried on\" to mean \"supported on.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Next, the court looks to the prosecution history of the patents at issue. It is here that Defendant contends that the applicant disclaimed the contention \"that the claimed invention covers a device having an intervening structure between the LEDs and the ETCM [elongate thermally conductive member].\" (Def.'s Mem. in Supp. of its Claim Construction (\"Def.'s Mem.\") (Doc. 115) at 14.)

(Decl. of Lynne A. Borchers (\"Borchers Decl.\"), Ex. E, '028 File History Amendment (Doc. 117-5) at 20 (\"The '819 patent teaches away from Applicant's novel structures.\").) Generally discussing the '819 Patent, the applicant stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   [T]he structures of the '819 patent require that the LEDs are carried on copper solder pads on one surface of a circuit board and heat transfer is via solder pads through the circuit board to a metallization layer on the opposite surface of the circuit board and then to the cooling member via an adhesive layer.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   The LEDs are not carried by the cooling member.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 21.) Later, when arguing that the examiner incorrectly applied the standard for anticipation, the applicant referenced figures from the '819 Patent and distinguished it from the invention at issue, stating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   It is clear from the drawings that the thermally conductive member 3 does not carry its LEDs 2 on its outer surface. Rather, the thermally\n   <em>\n    non-conductive\n   </em>\n   printed circuit board 1 carries the LEDs 2. The Examiner's attention is again directed to the reproduced portions of the reference above which clearly state that the LEDs are carried on the printed circuit board 1 and not on the structure 3.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   <em>\n    It is clear from a plain reading of the descriptions of the structures in the '819 patent that the printed circuit board 1 carries LEDs 2 on one surface and carries the heat sink 3 (thermally conductive member) on its opposite surface.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   In other words,\n   <em>\n    the '819 patent teaches away from the novel structures of applicant's claimed invention\n   </em>\n   which set forth structure in which the LEDs, solid state light sources, radiation emitting semiconductor devices, and radiation emitting solid state devices are carried on an elongate thermally conductive member.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 27.) While applicant certainly used the term \"carried on\" during the patent prosecution, the statements at issue were not made with respect to whether direct contact was required but instead with respect to which structure within the '819 patent supported various other parts of the invention. Here, nothing in the prosecution record amounts to a clear and unambiguous disavowal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    SanDisk Corp. v.

The court finds the following dictionary definitions of \"carry\" to be helpful in educating it as to possible ordinary meanings of this claim term: \"to bear the weight of,\"\n   <em>\n    Webster's New World Dictionary\n   </em>\n   (3d College ed. 1989), and \"to hold or be capable of holding,\"\n   <em>\n    Webster's II New College Dictionary\n   </em>\n   (2001);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Phillips\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8948489\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/415/1303/#p1312\">\n    415 F.3d at 1319\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[B]ecause extrinsic evidence can help educate the court regarding the field of the invention and can help the court determine what a person of ordinary skill in the art would understand claim terms to mean, it is permissible for the district court in its sound discretion to admit and use such evidence.\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court has also considered whether expert testimony could further educate it as to possible ordinary meanings. Looking to expert testimony provided as to this term, however, is unhelpful in further educating the court at this point in its analysis as the experts are in disagreement as to how such a person would understand the term. (\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   Decl. of Leah R. McCoy, Ex. 3, Expert Decl. of A. Brent York on Claim Construction (\"York Decl.\") (Doc. 119-3) \u00b6 54,\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   Supplemented Decl. of Dr. Eric Bretschneider (\"Bretschneider Suppl. Decl.\") (Doc. 116) \u00b6\u00b6 50-52.) Because the court cannot evaluate the credibility of the experts based on their declarations alone, it will refrain from weighing the testimony at this juncture and rely on the outcome clearly supported by the intrinsic evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Having considered the claim term, the specification, the prosecution history, and for the purpose of educating the court, extrinsic evidence, this court finds that a person of ordinary skill in the art would construe \" carried on\" as \"supported on.\" Accordingly, this court will adopt Plaintiff's construction of this term.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n    <em>\n     \"a plurality of solid state light sources\"\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <pre id=\"p-43\"><strong>Claim Term</strong> <strong>Plaintiff's</strong> <strong>Defendant's</strong> <strong>Construction</strong> <strong>Construction</strong> \"a plurality of \"two or more \"two or more solid state light packages, each of packages, each of sources\" ('028 which comprise a which comprise a Patent, claims 1-3, thermally conductive solid state light 5-8, 14, &amp; 16-17) back and a solid source\" state light source\"</pre>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The court starts by considering the claim term itself and the ordinary meaning that would be attributed to the term by a person skilled in the relevant art. Claim 1 of the '028 Patent, for example, describes \"a plurality of solid state light sources carried on said elongate member outer surface[.]\" '028 Patent col. 4, lines 33-37.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Here, the parties agree that\n   \"plurality\" should be construed as \"two or more,\" (Joint Claim Construction Statement (Doc. 106) at 2), consistent with its plain and ordinary meaning,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    York Prods., Inc. v. Cent. Tractor Farm &amp; Family Ctr.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7654043\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/99/1568/#p1575\">\n    99 F.3d 1568\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1575 (Fed. Cir. 1996). The parties' narrow disagreement with respect to this term is whether a \"thermally conductive back\" is necessarily included in this definition. Taken in isolation, this claim term does not appear to be limited to packages with a thermally conductive back.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Next, the court considers this claim term in light of the '028 Patent's specification. The '028 Patent's specification, however, does not describe \"solid state light sources\" and refers exclusively to \"LEDs.\"\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   '028 Patent cols. 1-4. Although the parties agreed to construe \"a plurality of light emitting diodes\" as \"two or more packages, each of which comprise a thermally conductive back and a diode that emits light[,]\" (Joint Claim Construction Statement (Doc. 106) at 1), the specification does not make clear how LEDs differ from solid state light sources. Further, both parties agree that LEDs are a subset of solid state light sources, but neither points to compelling material within the intrinsic evidence to explain how they differ. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   OptoLum's Opening Mem. in Supp. of Claim Construction (\"Pl.'s Mem.\") (Doc. 118) at 29; Def.'s Mem. (Doc. 115) at 14.) The specification provides that \"[f]lexible printed circuit 113 has mounting holes 134 for receiving LEDs 109 such that the backs of LEDs 109 are in thermal contact with the tube surface 107.\" '028 Patent col. 3, lines 45-51. Because the difference between LEDs and solid state light sources with respect to this invention is unclear, however, the court cannot conclude from the specification that solid state light sources likewise require thermally conductive backs. \"[C]laims are not to be interpreted by adding limitations appearing only in the specification.... [P]articular embodiments appearing in a specification will not be read into the claims when the claim language is broader than such embodiments.\"\n   <em>\n    Electro Med. Sys.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10530262\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/34/1048/#p1054\">\n    34 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1054 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    GE Lighting Solutions v.

Cir. 2014).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Next, the court looks to the prosecution history. Here, the court does not find any evidence relevant to this claim term. Having considered the claim term, the specification, and the prosecution history, the court concludes that a \"thermally conductive back\" limitation should not be read into this claim term. The extrinsic evidence only serves to further support the court's conclusion. While the parties' witnesses disagree with respect to their ultimate conclusion as to this term, only the Defendant's expert discusses how an LED and a solid state light source differ and how such differences might affect the construction of this term. (\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   York Decl. (Doc. 119-3) \u00b6\u00b6 78-79 (stating that a person of ordinary skill in the art would understand that the package includes a thermally conductive back but not going into why this is necessarily the case for all solid state light sources as compared to just LEDs),\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   Bretschneider Suppl. Decl. (Doc. 116) \u00b6\u00b6 76-84 (stating that solid state light sources encompass LEDs and that \"the full scope of the SSLS [solid state light source] phrase is indeterminate. This is because neither the patent specification nor its prosecution history explain or refer to the [solid state light source] phrase and it is not apparent to a POSA [person of\n   ordinary skill in the art] what other structures which fall within the plain meaning of the phrase but which may or may not be suitable to be incorporated in the overall structure described in the '028 patent.\"). Here, the only expert witness that directly engages this issue shares the court's concern about how LEDs and solid state light sources differ in scope. Accordingly, this court will adopt Defendant's proposed construction of the term \"a plurality of solid state light sources\" as \"two or more packages, each of which comprise a solid state light source.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    C.\n    <em>\n     \"disposed in a second plane not coextensive with said first plane\"\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <pre id=\"p-48\"><strong>Claim Term</strong> <strong>Plaintiff's</strong> <strong>Defendant's</strong> <strong>Construction</strong> <strong>Construction</strong> \"disposed in a \"arranged in a \"disposed in a second plane not second flat surface second plane that is coextensive with not having the same not the same as the said first plane\" spatial boundaries first plane wherein (all claims) as the first flat the plurality of surface\" LEDs are not disposed in a single plane perpendicular to the axis of the elongate thermally conductive member\"</pre>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The court starts with the claim term itself and the ordinary meaning that would be attributed to the term by a person skilled in the relevant art. This term appears, for example, in Claim 1 of the '028 Patent, which describes:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   [A] plurality of solid state light sources carried on said elongate member outer surface at least some of said solid state light sources being disposed in a first plane and others of said solid state light sources being disposed in a second plane not coextensive with said first plane[.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   '028 Patent col 4, lines 33-38.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The court next considers this claim term in light of the '028 Patent's specification.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Markman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7414970\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/52/967/#p979\">\n    52 F.3d at 979\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Within the summary of the invention, Patent '028 describes \"[a] plurality of light emitting diodes is carried on the elongate member outer surface. At least some of the light emitting diodes are disposed in a first plane and others of said light emitting diodes are disposed in a second plane not coextensive with the first plane.\" '028 Patent col 1, lines 49-53. Similarly worded to Claim 1, above, the use of the term in the specification does not provide much insight.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Next, the court turns to the prosecution history.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Markman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7414970\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/52/967/#p979\">\n    52 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   980 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Vitronics\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9051592\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/90/1576/#p1582\">\n    90 F.3d at 1582\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . It is here that Defendant contends that, in distinguishing the '028 Patent from the '819 Patent, the applicant disclaimed \"the circumstance in which LEDs are placed in a single plane perpendicular to the axis of the elongate heat sink.\" (Def.'s Mem. (Doc. 115) at 20.) Defendant, the party seeking to invoke a prosecution history disclaimer, carries the burden of proving that there was a \"clear and unmistakable\" disclaimer that would have been evident to a person of ordinary skill in the art.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Shire Pharm.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12177232\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/839/1111/#p1119\">\n    839 F.3d at 1119\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation omitted). In the prosecution of what became the '028 Patent, applicant made statements in response to the examiner rejecting the application as anticipated by the '819 patent. ( '028 File History Amendment (Doc. 117-5) at 23.) Statements relevant to the disputed claim terms centered around the below-pictured figure from the '819 Patent,\n   also contained in applicant's amendment/response:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 26.) Applicant stated in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   [T]he Examiner points to FIG. 2B as showing solid state light sources that are in a first plane and a second plane not coextensive with the first plane. The Examiner is mistaken.\n   <em>\n    All the LEDs shown in FIG. 2B are in the same plane, i.e., the plane defined by the drawing sheet.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 27.) Plaintiff contends that no such disavowal was made, pointing out that the '028 Patent refers to LEDs being \"disposed\" in a plane whereas the prosecution history references LEDs being \"in\" the same plane defined by the drawing sheet. (Pl.'s Suppl. Mem. in Supp. of Claim Construction (\"Pl.'s Suppl. Mem.\") (Doc. 140) at 8-9.) Plaintiff further contends that the \"clear and unmistakable standard\" was not met because the statements at issue were made with respect to a two-dimensional drawing and could be interpreted as highlighting an evidentiary defect in the Examiner's initial refusal. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10 &amp; n.4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   This court is unpersuaded by Plaintiff's arguments. Applicant's statements made during patent prosecution were in response to the Examiner's statement that Figure 2B in the '819 Patent illustrated \"solid state light sources that are in a first plane and a second plane not coextensive with the first plane.\" ( '028 File History Amendment (Doc. 117-5) at 27.) This issue was raised in relation to the Examiner's initial position that the claimed invention was anticipated by prior art, the '819 Patent. Applicant responded to the Examiner's position by contending that \"\n   <em>\n    [a]ll the LEDs shown in FIG. 2B are in the same plane, i.e., the plane defined by the drawing sheet\n   </em>\n   [,]\" thereby distinguishing the claimed invention from the '819 Patent.

This court finds such a statement to amount to a clear and unequivocal disclaimer.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Shire Pharm.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12177232\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/839/1111/#p1119\">\n    839 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1119 ;\n   <em>\n    Omega Eng'g\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1530191\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/334/1314/#p1324\">\n    334 F.3d at 1324\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The disclaimer that was made is extremely narrow, however. Applicant distinguished the claimed invention from one in which LED placement may be described as being in a single plane perpendicular to the axis of the elongate thermally conductive member. In other words, the two plane limitation is tied to the elongate nature of the elongate thermally conductive member such that Plaintiff's proffered explanation of Figure 2 of the '028 and '303 Patents and Figure 2B of the '819 Patent meeting the two plane limitation, pictured below, is unavailing:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   (Pl.'s Suppl.

Instead, this court is convinced that Defendant's proffered conceptualization of the two plane limitation, pictured below, is in keeping with the patent's teachings and prosecution history:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   (Def.'s Suppl. Mem. in Resp. to Ord. of Court and in Supp. of its Claim Construction (\"Def.'s Suppl. Mem.\") (Doc. 141) at 7.) In accordance with the overall teachings of the patent, this court will adopt Defendant's proposed construction: \" disposed in a second plane that is not the same as the first plane wherein the plurality of LEDs are not disposed in a single plane perpendicular to the axis of the elongate thermally conductive member.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <strong>\n    D.\n    <em>\n     \"plane\"\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <pre id=\"p-62\"><strong>Claim Term</strong> <strong>Plaintiff's</strong> <strong>Defendant's</strong> <strong>Construction</strong> <strong>Construction</strong> \"plane\" (all claims) \"a flat surface\" plain and ordinary meaning<sup>6</sup></pre>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   [\n   <strong>\n    Editor's Note:\n   </strong>\n   The preceding image contains the references for footnote\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   ]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   The court starts with the claim term itself and the ordinary meaning that would be attributed to the term by a person skilled in the relevant art. Closely related to the prior term, \"plane\" likewise appears, for example, in Claim 1 of the '028 Patent, which describes:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   [A] plurality of solid state light sources carried on said elongate member outer\n   surface at least some of said solid state light sources being disposed in a first plane and others of said solid state light sources being disposed in a second plane not coextensive with said first plane[.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   '028 Patent col 4, lines 33-38. Plaintiff advocates for \"plane\" to be construed as \"a flat surface.\" (York Decl. (Doc. 119-3) \u00b6 61 (claiming that a person of ordinary skill in the art would understand \"plane,\" in the context of the OptoLum patents, to require \"a flat surface on which to arrange the LEDs\"). On the other hand, Defendant first advocated for \"plane\" to be given its plain and ordinary meaning, while contending that Plaintiff's proposed \"flat surface\" construction would not be in keeping with said plain and ordinary meaning. (Bretschneider Suppl. Decl. (Doc. 116) \u00b6 64 (\" '[P]lane' in this context is understood by a POSA [person of ordinary skill in the art] to be a spatial relationship concerning certain identified locations on the elongate heat sink and having a specific mathematical description,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , that of a plane. In the context of the patents, the term 'plane' is not a physical 'surface' nor does it include the inaccurate descriptor of 'flat.' \").) A finding that the plain and ordinary meaning of the claim term should be adopted would be inadequate because it would \"not resolve the parties' dispute[,]\" specifically whether \"plane\" should be construed as referring to physical, flat surfaces alone.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    O2 Micro Int'l v.

Within the summary of the invention, Patent '028 describes \"[a] plurality of light emitting diodes is carried on the elongate member outer surface. At least some of the light emitting diodes are disposed in a first plane and others of said light emitting diodes are disposed in a second plane not coextensive with the first plane.\" '028 Patent col 1, lines 48-53. It is here that Plaintiff contends that the specification ties \"disposed in a ... plane\" to a flat surface. (Pl.'s Suppl. Mem. (Doc. 140) at 11.) While the specification and abstract mention LEDs being mounted on the elongate member's outer surface, \"plane\" is used to describe the fashion in which the LEDs are arranged and it is not necessarily linked with the physical flat elongate member's outer surface.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Next, the court turns to the prosecution history.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Markman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7414970\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/52/967/#p979\">\n    52 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   980 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Vitronics\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9051592\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/90/1576/#p1582\">\n    90 F.3d at 1582\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . First, applicant's usage of the term within the prosecution history is consistent with the term not being limited to physical flat surfaces, as it was used to describe a \"plane defined by the drawing sheet.\" ( '028 File History Amendment (Doc. 117-5) at 27.) Second, with respect to applicant's above-discussed discussed disclaimer, the \"plane\" of the invention implicated by the disclaimer - the plane perpendicular to the axis of the elongate thermally conductive member - is likewise not tied to the physical, flat surfaces thereof.

Considering this term as it appears within the claims alone does not provide much guidance. For example, Claim 1 of the '028 Patent references the term, stating, \"said elongate thermally conductive member comprises one or more heat dissipation protrusions, at least one of said heat dissipation protrusions being carried on said elongate member outer surface.\" '028 Patent col. 4, lines 47-50.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   While this claim term appears in claims within both the '028 and '303 patents, it only appears in the specification of the '028 patent.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   '028 Patent col. 3, lines 4-9 (referring to \"heat dissipating protrusions\"),\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   '303 Patent col. 2, line 67 - col. 3, line 2 (referring to \"heat dissipating fins\"). The detailed description within the specification of the '028 Patent provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-73\">\n   To improve the heat dissipative properties of light source 100, elongate heat sink 101 is configured to provide convective heat dissipation and cooling. As more clearly seen in FIG. 2, tubular heat sink 101 is hollow and has an interior cavity 103 that includes one or more heat dissipating protrusions 105. Protrusions 105 are shown as being triangular shaped fins but may take on other shapes. Protrusions or fins 105 are integrally formed on the interior of elongate heat sink 101. Each pair of fins 105 defines a channel 105\n   <em>\n    a\n   </em>\n   . In the illustrative embodiment convective cooling is provided by movement of a medium 102 through the channel formed by elongate heat sink 101. The medium utilized in the illustrative embodiment is air, but may in some applications be a fluid other than air to provide for greater heat dissipation and cooling.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   '028 Patent, col. 3, lines 1-17. Here, \"fins\" and \"heat dissipating protrusions\" are used interchangeably, as fins are one form protrusions may take. The summary of the invention of the '028 Patent, referring to \"fins,\" provides in part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-75\">\n   the elongate thermally conductive member transfers heat from the light emitting diodes to a medium within said elongate thermally conductive member. In the illustrative embodiment of the invention, the medium is air.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-76\">\n   In accordance with another aspect of the invention, the elongate thermally conductive member has one or more fins to enhance heat transfer to the medium.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   '028 Patent, col. 1, line 65 - col. 2, line 5. Defendant contends that Plaintiff's proposed construction is inaccurate because the fins themselves do not convect heat, but the medium (i.e., air) inside the elongate heat sink does. (Def.'s Mem. (Doc. 115) at 21-22.) Plaintiff, on the other hand, insists that the concept of convection is broad enough to encompass the transfer of heat from the surface of the protrusions in question to the fluid inside the elongate member. (Pl.'s Resp. to Cree's Claim Construction Br. (\"Pl.'s Resp.\") (Doc. 128) at 26.) Plaintiff further suggests that the definition appropriately uses the phrase \"designed to\" in accordance with this understanding of heat convection. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 26.) Nothing within the prosecution history runs contrary to this understanding of the term.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Finally, the court looks to dictionary definitions of \"dissipation\" and \"protrusion\" to further aid in its understanding of possible plain meanings of said terms. The court finds the following definition of \"dissipate\" to support its understanding of the intrinsic evidence: \"to cause to lose (e.g., heat) irreversibly.\"\n   <em>\n    Webster's II New College Dictionary\n   </em>\n   (2001). The court likewise finds the following definition of \"protrude\" instructive: \"to jut out.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8927598\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/424/1136/#p1145\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Looking to expert testimony as to this term, however, is unhelpful in further educating the court at this point in its analysis as the experts are in disagreement as to what a person of ordinary skill in the art would understand the term to mean. (\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   York Decl. (Doc. 119-3) \u00b6 72,\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   Bretschneider Suppl. Decl. (Doc. 116) \u00b6\u00b6 68-69.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Because a person of ordinary skill in the art would understand the patent to teach that the heat dissipation protrusions, or fins, serve to increase convection by increasing the surface area within the elongate member from which heat is transferred to the air, (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   '028 Patent, col. 2, lines 3-5 (\"[T]he elongate thermally conductive member has one or more fins to enhance heat transfer to the medium.\") ), this court will adopt Plaintiff's proposed construction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   <strong>\n    F.\n    <em>\n     \"contained\"\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <pre id=\"p-81\"><strong>Claim Term</strong> <strong>Plaintiff's</strong> <strong>Defendant's</strong> <strong>Construction</strong> <strong>Construction</strong> \"disposed in a \"arranged in a \"disposed in a second plane not second flat surface second plane that is coextensive with not having the same not the same as the said first plane\" spatial boundaries first plane wherein (all claims) as the first flat the plurality of surface\" LEDs are not disposed in a single plane perpendicular to the axis of the elongate thermally conductive member\"</pre>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   [\n   <strong>\n    Editor's Note:\n   </strong>\n   The preceding image contains the references for footnote\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   ]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   The court starts with the claim term itself and the ordinary meaning that would be attributed to the term by a person skilled in the relevant art. Claim 1 of the '028 Patent reads in relevant part, \"said elongate thermally conductive member being configured to conduct heat away from said solid state light sources to fluid\n   <em>\n    contained\n   </em>\n   by said elongate thermally conductive member[.]\" '028 Patent col. 4, lines 43-46 (emphasis added). In this instance, a finding that the term at issue should retain its plain and ordinary meaning alone would not resolve the underlying dispute between the parties.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    O2 Micro Int'l\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3736972\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/521/1351/#p1362\">\n    521 F.3d at 1362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Defendant advocates for a construction of \"enclosed by,\" which this court understands to mean total enclosure, or containment on all sides,\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Webster's II New College Dictionary\n   </em>\n   (2001) (\"to surround on all sides\");\n   <em>\n    Webster's New World Dictionary\n   </em>\n   (3d College ed. 1989) (\"to shut in all around; hem in; fence in; surround\"), whereas Plaintiff advocates for a construction of \"found within,\" which does not require total enclosure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   The court next looks to the specification. While the specification does not use the phrase \"contained,\" it further explains the context surrounding its usage in above-quoted Claim 1. First, the summary of the invention generally explains that, \"the elongate thermally conductive member transfers heat from the light emitting diodes to a medium within said elongate thermally conductive member.\" '028 Patent col. 1, line 65 - col. 2, line 1. The specification goes on to teach that, \"[i]n the illustrative embodiment convective cooling is provided by movement of a medium 102\n   <em>\n    through\n   </em>\n   the channel formed by elongate heat sink 101.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3736972\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/521/1351/#p1362\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at col. 3, lines 10-13\n   (emphasis added). Similarly, it explains \"convection cooling by flow of air\n   <em>\n    through\n   </em>\n   tubular heat sink 101 is utilized such that cool or unheated air\n   <em>\n    enters\n   </em>\n   tubular heat sink 101 at its lower end\n   <em>\n    and exits\n   </em>\n   from the upper end as heated air.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3736972\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/521/1351/#p1362\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at col. 4, lines 4-7 (emphasis added). Considering the patent's teachings within the specification, because this court understands Defendant's proposed construction to imply that the fluid is surrounded on all sides, it runs contrary to how a person of ordinary skill in the art would understand the teachings of the patent. The invention teaches the free movement of a medium through the elongate member, suggesting that Plaintiff's alternative construction \"found within\" is more appropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Next, the court looks to the prosecution history of the patent. Here, Defendant contends that the '536 Patent, a predecessor to the patents at issue, was amended to replace \"within\" with \"contained.\" (Def.'s Resp. Mem. (Doc. 127) at 22.) Defendant does not argue, however, that this amendment amounts to a prosecution history disclaimer. This court likewise does not find that such an amendment amounts to an unequivocal disclaimer.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Omega Eng'g\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1530191\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/334/1314/#p1324\">\n    334 F.3d at 1324-25\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   This court's review of the extrinsic evidence only serves to further support this conclusion. Both parties' expert witnesses agree that the elongate member has an opening at the top and bottom. (York Decl. (Doc. 119-3) \u00b6 67; Bretschneider Suppl. Decl. (Doc. 116) \u00b6\u00b6 72-73.) Nonetheless, Defendant contends that unless the medium (i.e., air) is enclosed within the elongate member, the cooling feature of the invention is lost. (Def.'s Mem. (Doc. 115) at 23.) Because the overwhelming intrinsic evidence supports Plaintiff's preferred construction, the court will adopt \" found within\" with respect to this term.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   <strong>\n    G.\n    <em>\n     \"channel\"\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <pre id=\"p-88\"><strong>Claim Term</strong> <strong>Plaintiff's</strong> <strong>Defendant's</strong> <strong>Construction</strong> <strong>Construction</strong> \"channel\" ('303 \"the space defined \"a hollow extruded Patent claim 9; '028 by a pair of heat extended structure\" Patent claims 8 &amp; dissipation 22) protrusions\"</pre>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   The court starts with the claim term itself and the ordinary meaning that would be attributed to the term by a person skilled in the relevant art.
