Orrick, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Plaintiff, on behalf of herself and a proposed class of nationwide consumers and a subclass of California consumers, challenges defendant Costco Wholesale Corporation's (Costco) advertising and marketing on its Kirkland Signature Premium Liquid Dish Soap (Dish Soap) and Kirkland Signature Premium Laundry Detergent (Laundry Detergent, collectively Products) as \"environmentally responsible.\" Plaintiff alleges that Costco's use of various \"environmentally friendly\" phrases and images on its labeling and marketing for the Products is false, misleading, and in violation of state and federal laws because the Products contain \"unnatural, harmful, and toxic chemical ingredients\" and that reasonable consumers do not expect\n   such ingredients to be in products labeled \"environmentally responsible.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Costco moves to dismiss. I am denying that motion because plaintiff has adequately alleged her deceptive and fraud-based claims and Costco's challenges to the same cannot be resolved on a motion to dismiss. Costco also moves to stay this case until a pending motion to dismiss is resolved by the Eastern District of New York in a case based on similar misrepresentations. I deny that motion as well because the claims here are largely based on California law (and to a lesser extent Washington law) while the claims in the other case are based largely on New York law. Moreover, staying this case is not equitable because in the Eastern District of New York Costco sought, and the plaintiffs eventually agreed, to dismiss California law claims from that litigation. Those claims should proceed here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiff challenges Costco's advertising and marketing its Kirkland Signature Premium Dish Soap and Laundry Detergent as \"environmentally responsible,\" along with specific representations that the Products are made from \"naturally derived ingredients,\" are \"recognized for safer chemistry,\" are \"safer for the planet,\" and are made with a \"biodegradable formula.\" Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 4-6 (Statements).

Standing\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   As an initial matter, Costco argues that plaintiff cannot sue for claims based on the Laundry Detergent because she does not allege she bought it, the Laundry Detergent has an \"entirely different\" formula from the Dish Soap she purchased, and the Laundry Detergent has an entirely different use than the Dish Soap.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   As my prior opinions in food labeling context have explained, plaintiffs have standing to sue over \"unpurchased products\" when the label statements challenged are very similar to the statements on the labels of the unpurchased products and there are no material differences between the products that would significantly alter the reasonable consumer analysis.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ang v. Bimbo Bakeries USA, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , No. 13-CV-01196-WHO,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%201024182\">\n    2014 WL 1024182\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *8 (N.D. Cal. Mar. 13, 2014) (\"the best approach is one which focuses on whether the type of claim and consumer injury is substantially similar as between the purchased and unpurchased products. That determination necessarily focuses on whether the resolution of the asserted\n   claims will be identical between the purchased and unpurchased products.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Facts that plaintiff did not purchase the Laundry Detergent and the Laundry Detergent has different ingredients and that the Laundry Detergent only shares one harmful ingredient with the Dish Soap are not in and of themselves hurdles to plaintiff's standing.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gallagher v.

Cal.

Cal. 2017) (non-legally-significant differences in product ingredients does not defeat standing to sue for unpurchased products). Here, Costco has not alleged, much less shown, that the Statements and imagery that plaintiff complains of differ in a legally significantly way between the purchased-Dish Soap and the unpurchased Laundry Detergent. Nor has Costco explained how the facts that the Laundry Detergent and Dish Soap have different ingredients, different uses, and share only one of the \"toxic\" ingredients plaintiff complains of are legally significant to whether reasonable consumers will be misled or what reasonable consumers expect from those Products given the Products' labeling and imagery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Arguments about the differences between the Products, including their uses and their ingredients, may be significant on class certification or summary judgment. But Costco's bare assertion that there are differences is not enough to show a lack of standing. Costco's motion is DENIED on this ground.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Actionable Misrepresentations for Breach\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Costco argues that plaintiff has not stated and cannot state a breach of warranty claim because: (i) \"environmentally responsible\" is too vague a representation to be an express warranty; (ii) the warranty that plaintiff is actually trying to enforce is that the Products would contain only \"non-toxic, natural substances\" but that claim appears nowhere on the Products; and (iii) plaintiff has pleaded no facts supporting breach because she ignores label statements that adequately \"substantiate\" the \"environmentally responsible\" representation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   In general, a plaintiff asserting a breach of warranty claim must allege facts sufficient to show that: (1) the seller's statements constitute an affirmation of fact or promise or a description of the goods; (2) the statement was part of the basis of the bargain; and (3) the warranty was breached.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Weinstat v.

Cal. Sept. 22, 2016) (denying motion to dismiss breach of warranty claim as to statements including \"Superfood,\" \"Coconut is one of the world's most nourishing foods,\" \"is 'better than butter,' \" and \"A nutritious substitute in baking\" because, taking inferences in the light most favorable to plaintiff, \"the challenged statements\n   constitute an affirmative fact or promise\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   When determining whether an express warranty has been made, courts look to the context of the statement, including other content on the label.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Jones v. Nutiva, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%205210935\">\n    2016 WL 5210935\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *7 (\"considered in the context of Defendant's entire Virgin Coconut Oil label, this statement could 'certainly contribute [ ] ... to the deceptive context of the package as a whole.' \"). At this juncture, as with the \"all natural\" cases, the \"environmentally responsible\" claim can, taking all reasonable inferences in the plaintiff's favor, constitute an affirmative fact or promise sufficient to create a warranty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Costco's argument that the warranty plaintiff wants to assert (that the Products only contain non-toxic, natural substances) but cannot because that representation is not made on its labelling, fares no better. Plaintiff contends that the promise that the Products are \"environmentally responsible\" is false because the products contain chemicals that have been identified by authorities as hazardous, toxic, or bad for the environment. Costco cannot attempt to shift plaintiff's theory in order to dismiss it. Costco's argument that plaintiff has failed to allege sufficient facts to show how the warranty is breached also fails. Plaintiff's Complaint is very specific regarding why Costco's has breached the warranty of \"environmentally responsible,\" namely by including in the product toxic and hazardous ingredients.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Finally, Costco's position that plaintiff's warranty claims fail because other, unrelied on statements on the back of the Products' labels are true and show that the products are (in some ways) \"environmentally responsible\" may provide a good defense at summary judgment, but cannot be used to win on a motion to dismiss. Those unchallenged statements are \"Designed for the Environment U.S. EPA Recognized for Safer Chemistry\", \"Biodegradable formula per OECD [standards]\", and \"USDA Certified Biobased Product\" representations. Mot. at 9. Even if I could rely on these unchallenged statements to evaluate the merits of plaintiff's breach claim, the\n   <em>\n    import\n   </em>\n   of those statements with respect to the Statements plaintiff does rely on is not obvious at this juncture. For example, simply because a product has a \"biodegradable formula\" per for OECD, does that mean as a matter of law that a reasonable consumer would find the product environmentally responsible notwithstanding the presence of an (allegedly) highly toxic ingredient? These sorts of determinations must be made with an evidentiary record later in the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Costco's motion is DENIED on this ground.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Specificity of Fraud-Based Claims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Costco contends that each of plaintiff's consumer-protection claims are fraud-based and, therefore, she must plead her claims with specificity in accordance with Rule 9(b). I agree that Rule 9(b) applies to plaintiff's California consumer misrepresentation claims as well as the claim arising under Washington law. However, Rule 9(b) only requires plaintiff to identify \"the who, what, when, where, and how of the misconduct charged,\" as well as \"what is false or misleading about [the purportedly fraudulent] statement, and why it is false.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ebeid ex rel. United States v. Lungwitz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3768119\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/616/993/#p998\">\n    616 F.3d 993\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 998 (9th Cir. 2010) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Costco argues that plaintiff has failed to meet the 9(b) standard because she does not allege facts showing how she became aware that the Statements on the Products were false, when and how she learned the Products contained\n   the hazardous and toxic chemicals, and when or how she came to the belief that the presence of those ingredients in the Products contradicted the Statements. Mot. at 10. What Costco seeks, however, is information that it may uncover during discovery. All that is required, even under Rule 9(b), is for plaintiff to \"set forth what is false or misleading about a statement, and why it is false.\"\n   <em>\n    Vess v. Ciba-Geigy Corp. USA\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9344027\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/317/1097/#p1106\">\n    317 F.3d 1097\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1106 (9th Cir. 2003). The allegations of fraud \"must be specific enough to give defendants notice of the particular misconduct which is alleged to constitute the fraud charged so that they can defend against the charge and not just deny that they have done anything wrong.\"\n   <em>\n    Swartz v.

The detailed allegations in plaintiff's Complaint do just that. Costco is entitled to no more at the juncture.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Deception under State Consumer Protection Statutes\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Finally, Costco argues that the term \"environmentally responsible\" is not deceptive under the CLRA, UCL, and Washington consumer protection statutes\n   <em>\n    when\n   </em>\n   that statement is considered in connection with other, unchallenged statements on the labels.

Costco contends the cases are materially similar, except that the sub-class in\n   <em>\n    Gonzalez\n   </em>\n   is New York consumers and tied to New York consumer protection statutes. Costco's motion to dismiss the Second Amended Complaint in\n   <em>\n    Gonzalez\n   </em>\n   has been pending since November 2017. Costco notes that in\n   <em>\n    Gonzalez\n   </em>\n   , there was a California plaintiff asserting the same California consumer protection claims asserted here, but that plaintiff voluntarily dismissed her claims in\n   <em>\n    Gonzalez\n   </em>\n   one month after this case was filed.

However, now that the California-based plaintiff's claims have been dismissed in\n   <em>\n    Gonzalez\n   </em>\n   , with prodding from Costco, the differences between the cases in terms of what laws are in play with respect to the nationwide class and state law sub-classes are not that similar, although the underlying questions (\n   <em>\n    e.g\n   </em>\n   ., what is deceptive and as such illegal) may be. In addition, that Costco moved to dismiss the California law claims in\n   <em>\n    Gonzalez\n   </em>\n   and was successful in convincing plaintiff to drop them in that case is significant.
