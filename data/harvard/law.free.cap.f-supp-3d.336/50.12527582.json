Indeed, one need only look to the reason given by the legislature itself: \"to preserve and enhance access to\" TNC services, services which provide \"important transportation options for residents and visitors to the state.\" N.Y.

That the legislature would want to supplement and expand transportation options, especially in traditionally underserved areas, is certainly rationally related to and served by the licensing and regulatory regime established in Article 44-B. In light of the distinctions between the operations and business models of traditional taxicab operators and TNCs identified above -- how rides are ordered/procured, how fees are charged, the relationship between an entity and its drivers/vehicles, and the relationship between an entity and the surrounding community -- Article 44-B rationally serves to effect the legislature's stated purpose.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   As the Supreme Court has stated, \"[t]he general rule is that legislation is presumed to be valid and will be sustained if the classification drawn by the statute is rationally related to a legitimate state interest.
