LLC's Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings pursuant Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(c), regarding End-Payor Plaintiffs' Second Amended Consolidated Complaint. (ECF No. 755). This case arises from allegations that two drug companies, Pfizer and Ranbaxy, engaged in an anticompetitive scheme that prevented the generic drug of Lipitor from entering the market. Plaintiffs are end-payor purchasers (hereinafter \"EPP\") who claim to have paid inflated costs for the brand-named drug, Lipitor, due to, among other things, a delayed entry provision included in Pfizer and Ranbaxy's settlement agreement. Unlike the Direct Purchaser Plaintiffs, who assert claims under the Sherman Act, the EPPs base their claims on their respective\n   state's antitrust and consumer protection acts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Parties\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Plaintiffs are a collection of organizations including insurance carriers, Taft-Hartley funds, municipalities, and individuals, who have been indirectly affected by Defendants' alleged schemes. For example, jointly administered Taft-Hartley fund and employee welfare benefit plaintiffs include: A.F.L.-A.G.C. Building Trades Welfare Plan, a self-insured health and welfare benefit plan in Alabama (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 24); New Mexico United Food and Commercial Workers Union's and Employers' Health and Welfare Trust Fund, a Taft-Hartley fund (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 26); Bakers Local 433 Health Fund of South Dakota; and Minnesota's Twin Cities Bakery Workers Health and Welfare Fund. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 28-29).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Health insurance carrier plaintiffs include: Louisiana Health Services Indemnity Company d/b/a Bluecross/Blueshield of Louisiana, a corporation licensed to conduct business in Louisiana that provides health benefits to covered members (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 27); Fraternal Order of Police, Fort Lauderdale Lodge 31, Insurance Trust Fund, a governmental health insurance plan that provides health and major medical insurance to active and retired Fort Lauderdale police officers and their dependents. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 30).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Municipality plaintiffs include: the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, Maryland (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 25), and the City of Providence, Rhode Island, both municipal corporations with self-insured health and welfare benefit plans. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 31).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Finally, the six individual plaintiffs are Edward Czarnecki, a Wisconsin resident; Emilie Heinle, a North Dakota resident; Andrew Livenzey from Massachusetts; Edward Ellenson from Hawaii; Jean Ellyne Dougan, an Arkansas resident; and Nancy Billington of Montana (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 32-37).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   All plaintiffs claim to have purchased or provided partial payment for some of, or the entire price of, Lipitor or its generic version. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 24-46). Plaintiffs contend that they were all injured as a result of Defendants' anticompetitive schemes, since they paid a premium for the medication. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Defendants in this case are Pfizer and Ranbaxy. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 38-46). Pfizer Inc., Pfizer Ireland Pharmaceuticals, and Warner-Lambert Company are collectively referred to as Pfizer. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 38-42). Pfizer Inc. is the parent company of Pfizer Ireland Pharmaceuticals, an Irish unlimited liability company that is a wholly owned, indirect subsidiary of Pfizer Inc. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 38-39). Pfizer acquired Warner-Lambert Company in 2000. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 40). According to the Complaint, reference to Warner-Lambert also includes, but is not limited to, Warner-Lambert employees Bruce D. Roth, Joan Thierstein, and Jerry F. Janssen. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 41). In addition, the Complaint names Defendants Ranbaxy Laboratories Limited, Ranbaxy Inc., and Ranbaxy Pharmaceuticals Inc. collectively as Ranbaxy. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 43-46). Ranbaxy Laboratories Limited is an Indian corporation that wholly owns Ranbaxy Inc., which has a place of business in New Jersey. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 43-49).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Facts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In the Complaint, EPPs identify several anticompetitive schemes that purportedly give rise to the present lawsuit. Specifically, Plaintiffs allege that Defendants fraudulently obtained a second, duplicative, patent from the United States Patent and Trademark Office (PTO); listed that patent in the book of Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations\n   (the \"Orange Book\"); engaged in sham litigation relating to the second patent; filed a sham citizen petition with the FDA; entered into an unlawful reverse payment agreement with Ranbaxy; and manipulated the statutorily created 180 day first-to-file period\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   to sustain Pfizer's and Ranbaxy's exclusivity and collectively prevent other generic companies from entering the market. The Court discusses each allegation in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <em>\n    1. Walker Process and Fraudulent Orange Book Allegations\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   EPPs first present a\n   <em>\n    Walker Process\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   claim against Pfizer, based on Pfizer's enforcement of an invalid patent and fraudulent listing of the patent in the Orange Book. By way of background, Warner-Lambert, which was later acquired by Pfizer in 2000, applied for the Original Lipitor Patent on March 30, 1986 and subsequently received Patent No. 4,681,893 ('893 Patent) on July 21, 1987. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 95, 104). The Original Lipitor Patent was for a racemic mixture, which contains equal amounts of two enantiomers that inhibit the production of cholesterol. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 7). Enantiomers are made of mirrored images of stereoisomers, which are two or more compounds with the same atoms but arranged differently. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 85-86). In a racemic mixture, it is common for one enantiomer to have all or most of the biological activity, while the other is largely inactive. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 89).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   According to the Complaint, the compounds in the '893 Patent were not limited to any particular stereochemistry; instead, the structure included four different stereoisomers possibilities: R-trans, S-trans, R-cis, and S-cis isomers. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 103). Even though the '893 Patent covered the multiple possibilities, Warner-Lambert focused on developing the R-trans enantiomer of the compound, in calcium salt form, which would eventually be sold as Lipitor. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 106-07). Warner-Lambert achieved patent extensions and regulatory exclusivities that postponed the patent's expiration from May 30, 2006 to March 24, 2010. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 104).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On July 21, 1989, Warner-Lambert applied for a patent to specifically protect the R-trans enantiomer, which later became the '995 Enantiomer Patent. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 126). According to the Complaint, Warner-Lambert had to prove the R-trans enantiomer's activity had a \"surprising\" or \"unexpected\" characteristic to procure a subsequent patent; put differently, they had to justify why the proposed patent was not already protected by the by the '893 Patent. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 109). Plaintiffs allege Warner-Lambert tasked its senior management with finding \"something that could be mischaracterized as surprising.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 110-14). Warner-Lambert included a table in the '995 Patent application to demonstrate the surprising results that the R-trans enantiomer was one hundred times more active than the S-trans enantiomer and ten times more active than the racemic mixture. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 128). However, Plaintiffs claim that one skilled in the art would know \"one enantiomer is the 'active' isomer, while the other is 'inactive,' and thus the active enantiomer is about twice as active as the racemic mixture.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 121). Further, the Complaint states Warner-Lambert would have known, through testing and experimentation, that the R enantiomer was likely to be the active isomer. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 122). Plaintiffs allege that Warner-Lambert failed to calculate the average result from its various tests and, instead, \"cherry-picked\n   from among the results [of the tests] in order to generate a table that supported its claim of 'surprising activity.' \" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 135). As a result, the data Warner-Lambert provided in its application was allegedly both false and misleading, since the R-trans enantiomer is approximately twice as active as the racemic mixture, not ten times. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 133).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The PTO originally rejected the '995 Patent application, since the invention was already covered and anticipated by the claims in the previously procured '893 Patent. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 153). Under patent law, a patent application can be rejected \"if the differences between the subject matters sought to be patented and the prior art [are] such that the subject matter as a whole would have been obvious at the time of the invention was made to a person having ordinary skill in the art to which said subject matter pertains.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 154). In response to the PTO's rejection, Warner-Lambert then requested to amend its application to provide a declaration by Dr. Bruce Roth, who participated in developing Lipitor, in support of the newfound information regarding the R-trans enantiomer's activity. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 159-60). In his declaration, Roth asserted that the available data \"shows the activity of [the R-trans enantiomer] is\n   <em>\n    surprising and unexpected\n   </em>\n   because if the [S-trans enantiomer] is accepted as inactive, the activity of [the R-trans enantiomer] would be expected to be only twice that of the racemic mixture\" and not the ten times that occurred. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 165-66). Warner-Lambert argued the surprising nature of this information overcomes the obvious inclusion under the '893 Patent and, thus, warrants the issuance of the '995 Patent. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 161). Plaintiffs contend the data presented to the PTO, including the Roth Declaration were knowingly false and misleading and used to fraudulently convince the PTO to procure the new patent. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 133, 165, 170-74). Persuaded by the data submitted, the PTO eventually issued the '995 Enantiomer Patent on December 28, 1993. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 182).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   As a result of its two approved patents, Warner-Lambert submitted a new drug application to the FDA for Lipitor, which was approved on December 17, 1996. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 201). Warner-Lambert then listed both the '893 Original Lipitor Patent and the '995 Enantiomer Patent in the Orange Book, which expired on May 30, 2006 and December 28, 2010, respectively. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 203-04). Thereafter, it applied for an extension of the '893 Original Lipitor Patent to account for the difference in time between the issuance of the patent covering the active ingredient in the new drug and the FDA's approval of that drug. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 206-08). As a result, the PTO postponed '893 Patent's expiration until March 24, 2010. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 213).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <em>\n    2. Sham Litigation and Citizen Petition Allegations\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Plaintiffs next contend Defendants engaged in sham litigation against Ranbaxy. On August 19, 2002, Ranbaxy filed an Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA) to sell a generic version of Lipitor. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 221-22). While Ranbaxy verified their generic version would not violate any of the Lipitor patents, Pfizer, who had acquired Warner-Lambert by this time, filed a patent infringement lawsuit against Ranbaxy on February 21, 2003 for allegedly infringing on the '893 and '995 Patents. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 223-24). In the pre-trial proceedings, Pfizer attempted to amend its complaint to include process patent infringement claims; however, their motion was denied since these patents could not be listed in the Orange Book and, therefore,\n   were not a basis for the suit.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 226-27). On appeal from the District of Delaware, the Federal Circuit ruled in Pfizer's favor, finding that Ranbaxy's product infringed on the '893 Patent. However, it also dismissed Pfizer's '995 Patent infringement claim since it had an improper dependent claim structure. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 232). As a result, Ranbaxy had to wait until the expiration of the '893 Patent in March 2010, before selling its generic version. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 232, 234).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Plaintiffs contend since the '995 Patent was fraudulently obtained, the patent infringement litigation against Ranbaxy was a baseless sham, that was intended to interfere with the introduction of Ranbaxy's generic drug into the market. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 230).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Plaintiffs also allege that Pfizer filed a baseless citizen petition with the FDA, in further attempt to delay the entry of generic versions of Lipitor. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 235). According to the Complaint, Ranbaxy's ANDA could have received FDA approval in August 2005, thereby creating generic competition. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 236-38). However, a month beforehand, July 2005, Pfizer sent a letter to the FDA, in an attempt to further delay the entry to generic versions of Lipitor. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 239). Four months later, November 7, 2005, Pfizer re-filed this letter, as a citizen petition, alleging that the generic brand's use of \"amorphous atorvastatincalcium\" could be \"susceptible to higher levels of impurities\" than Pfizer's crystalline version; as such, Pfizer averred that Ranbaxy's application needed to be carefully scrutinized and reviewed with considerable skepticism. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 241-42). However, Plaintiffs claim Pfizer had also used amorphous versions in their testing and development of Lipitor and, therefore, knew that it could be, and had been, safely made. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 242-46). As such these purported safety concerns were unfounded. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Further, Pfizer knew from its earlier litigation with Ranbaxy that Ranbaxy's generic drug was amorphous, rather than crystalline. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). According to Plaintiffs, the FDA's previous decisions expressly indicated that special or additional scrutiny would not be applied when reviewing an ANDA, when a different form was used; instead, the stability of a drug, not its substance, would be the key focus in measuring the drug's quality. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 251). As such, given Pfizer's knowledge that amorphous versions posed no safety risks, as well as the FDA's approach to treating ANDA claims, Plaintiffs claim the petition was a baseless attempt to delay generic competition. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 261-66).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <em>\n    3. Reverse Settlement Allegations\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Finally, Plaintiffs challenge the validity of a reverse settlement agreement made between Pfizer and Ranbaxy, after Pfizer attempted to obtain reissuance of the '995 Patent. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 323). To correct the invalidation of the '995 Patent, Pfizer applied for its reissuance in 2007 and conceded that the data included in its original application, concerning the R-trans enantiomer's effectiveness, contained significant errors. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 274-76). Therefore, it would no longer rely on this information in its reissuance proceedings. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 283). Without this information, Ranbaxy filed a protest with\n   the PTO, contending that the content of the '995 Patent was \"anticipated, obvious, [and] constituted double-patenting.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 279, 284). As a result, the PTO issued a non-final rejection of Pfizer's reissuance application, since it \"had before it no scientific basis to conclude the enantiomer claims were anything other than obvious over the '893 Patent.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 285, 293). Given Pfizer's failure to receive approval for the '995 Patent, there was a strong possibility that generic brand drugs would enter the market upon expiration of the '893 Patent in March 2010. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 287-88, 294).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   While Pfizer struggled to obtain a reissuance of the '995 Patent in 2008, it was later discovered that Ranbaxy may have infringed on another patented drug, Accupril, and, therefore, Pfizer had a potential patent infringement claim worth millions of dollars in damages. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 311-12). According to the Complaint, upon learning of this information \"Pfizer needed a stage to disguise a reverse payment to Ranbaxy in order to buy Ranbaxy's agreement to delay launching of its generic version of Lipitor. If there were a pending court case against Ranbaxy involving Lipitor, Pfizer could settle with Ranbaxy through a reverse payment and (unlawfully) extend its Lipitor market exclusivity\"; however, when Pfizer learned of Ranbaxy's potential Accupril infringement, there was no active litigation pending. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 313).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Irrespective of its reasoning, it is undisputed that Pfizer filed a complaint against Ranbaxy in March 2008 for infringing on Process Patents of the '740 and '511 Patents. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 314-315). However, as mentioned above, a court had already ruled that these patents were not exclusionary and, therefore, provided no basis for relief. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 308, 316). This being said, less than three months after the suit was filed, the parties entered into a reverse settlement agreement, whereby Ranbaxy would refrain from manufacturing or selling generic Lipitor until November 30, 2011. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 315, 323-26). According to the Complaint, Pfizer and Ranbaxy disguised this agreement as a way to settle the process patent litigation when, in actuality, it was a \"pretext for its true anticompetitive goals and accomplishments.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 323-24). Under the terms of the agreement, Ranbaxy paid Pfizer $1 million and Pfizer dismissed its multi-million dollar patent infringement claims based on Ranbaxy's generic version of Accupril. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 327). In addition, Ranbaxy was permitted the right to market its generic version of Lipitor in some foreign markets. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Further, Ranbaxy did not waive its market exclusivity right to be the first to file an ANDA for Lipitor ; thereby preventing other generic competition from entering the market until after November 30, 2011. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 363-65). In return, Ranbaxy also ceased challenging Pfizer's reissuance of the '995 Patent. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 366). As a result, the PTO eventually granted reissuance of the '995 Patent, relying in part on Lipitor's commercial success to prove the patent could not have been obvious and, therefore, was not covered by the '893 Original Lipitor Patent. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 414).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Plaintiffs contend the accumulation of Pfizer's conduct demonstrates an anticompetitive scheme to prevent generic brands from interfering with Lipitor's market share and, as a result, Pfizer's profitability. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 446). Had Pfizer not fraudulently procured the '995 Patent, Plaintiffs claim there would have been no basis for its reissuance. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). In addition, Ranbaxy only stopped protesting the '995 patent after it entered a reverse settlement agreement with Pfizer. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). If not for these circumstances, the EPPs contend that generic versions of Lipitor would have been able to enter into the market much earlier. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 447).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Plaintiffs bring this case on behalf of themselves and all End-Payor class members to recover damages, calculated by the increased price they had to pay due to Pfizer's conduct in delaying the market entry of generic Lipitor. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 486). The class contains individuals or entities who purchased or paid for Lipitor and/or its generic version for consumption by themselves, their families, or members, employees, insureds, participants, or beneficiaries in Arizona, California, Florida, Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Tennessee, Utah, West Virginia, Wisconsin, and the District of Columbia. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 487). The Class sues for overage damages occurred from March 24, 2010 until the effects of Defendants' conduct cease.

The conduct giving rise to this claim is the fraudulent obtainment of the '995 Patent, its listing in the Orange Book, its sham litigation and citizen petition, the reissuance of the patent, and the unlawful reverse settlement agreement with Ranbaxy. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 500). The same factual allegations and theories asserted in Count I are again alleged in Count II against all Defendants.

Finally, Plaintiffs allege a claim unfair or deceptive trade practices against all Defendants. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 546). Plaintiffs contend that as a result of Pfizer's anticompetitive acts or practices, Plaintiffs and the Class were deprived of the opportunity to obtain a less expensive, generic equivalent to Lipitor.

First, because Plaintiffs' claims are based on the purportedly fraudulent procurement and enforcement of the '995 patent, they must demonstrate that the patent is invalid or unenforceable, which is preempted under federal patent law. Second, to the extent that Plaintiffs' antitrust claims are based on the reverse settlement agreement, they are preempted since they must demonstrate the validity of the generic patents, which necessarily implicates patent law.

According to Defendants, the allegations in Plaintiffs' complaint that trigger federal patent law include: (1) the fraudulent procurement of the '995 patent (2) the fraudulent patent listing of the '995 Patent in the FDA's Orange Book; and (3) the \"sham\" litigation against Ranbaxy, seeking to enforce the '995 Patent, in addition to its two\n   process patents. Defendants, citing little or no supporting case law, contend that these allegations require first knowing whether the patent at issue is invalid or unenforceable. If the patent was valid, then the obtainment and enforcement of same would be lawful. As such, Defendants argue that because federal patent law is necessary to support these theories, they are preempted by federal law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   However, Defendants' arguments are in direct contravention with the Third Circuit's recent holding in\n   <em>\n    Lipitor\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276741\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/855/126/#p143\">\n    855 F.3d at 126\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   In\n   <em>\n    Lipitor\n   </em>\n   , the Third Circuit explicitly held that the present matter does not \"arise under\" federal patent law.

Put differently, the Third Circuit explained that the plaintiffs were unable to prove that \"but for\" the defendants' settlement agreement, the generic drug would have entered the market, since a patent blocking the generic versions would have nevertheless created the same effect.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12263901\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/868/132/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The Court rejects Defendants' expansive reading of\n   <em>\n    Wellbutrin\n   </em>\n   to hold that antitrust claims, based on reverse settlement agreements, are preempted by federal patent law.\n   <em>\n    Wellbutrin\n   </em>\n   simply sets forth considerations to be made when presented with an issue of antitrust standing, based on reverse settlement agreements. At no point in its decision did the Third Circuit mention that such an issue would trigger federal patent preemption.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wellbutrin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12263901\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/868/132/\">\n    868 F.3d at 163-70\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As such, while an antitrust claim may relate to patent issues, it is not always the case that it is necessary to explore its validity. Secondly, as noted above in\n   <em>\n    Lipitor\n   </em>\n   , the Third Circuit has already held that this case was not preempted by federal law, since Plaintiffs' claims are predicated on theories of antitrust, not patent law.\n   <em>\n    Lipitor\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276741\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/855/126/#p143\">\n    855 F.3d at 146\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As such, because Plaintiffs' antitrust claims do not implicate federal patent law, the Court will not dismiss these claims based on preemption. Finally,\n   <em>\n    Wellbutrin\n   </em>\n   was decided at summary judgment, where the district court had before it a full and complete record and was, therefore, capable of making determinations not presently available at the pleading stage. For these reasons, the Court finds Defendants' arguments, relying on\n   <em>\n    Wellbutrin\n   </em>\n   , premature.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <em>\n    3. Federal Patent Law Preemption of the Citizen Petition\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Lastly, Defendants argue that Plaintiffs' claim that Defendants filed sham citizen petition with the FDA is also preempted. By way of background, a citizen petition is a written request made by an interested person to the FDA, asking the agency to \"issue, amend, or revoke a regulation or order, or take or refrain from taking any other forms of administrative action.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2010.25\">\n    21 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 10.25\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 10.30. Here, Defendants make a similar \"but for\" argument as discussed above in\n   <em>\n    Wellbutrin\n   </em>\n   and contend that before addressing the merits of the sham citizen petition claim, Plaintiffs must first prove that the challenged patent was invalid, because if it is valid, then the patent, and not the citizen petition, prevented market entry of the generic brands.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   This argument fails for two reasons. First,\n   <em>\n    Lipitor\n   </em>\n   expressly held that federal patent law is not implicated by a citizen petition claim, \"whether [an FDA] petition was a sham is an issue independent of patent law.\"\n   <em>\n    Lipitor\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276741\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/855/126/#p143\">\n    855 F.3d at 146\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    In re DDAVP Direct Purchaser Antitrust Litig\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3481681\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/585/677/#p686\">\n    585 F.3d 677\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 686 (2d Cir. 2009) ). In any event, even if a citizen petition claim did implicate federal patent law, the Third Circuit has made clear that unless\n   <em>\n    every\n   </em>\n   theory of the claim requires the resolution of a substantial question of federal law, it does not \"arise under\" federal patent law.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3481681\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/585/677/#p686\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Therefore, as discussed\n   above, since this case does not \"arise under\" federal patent law, preemption is not appropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Alternatively, Defendants argue that the federal law governing the FDA preempts Plaintiffs' sham citizen petition claim. Here, Defendants rely primarily on the Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Buckman Co. v.

In\n   <em>\n    DDAVP\n   </em>\n   , the Southern District of New York held that \"claims mak[ing] 'freestanding allegations of wrongdoing apart from the defendant's purported failure to comply with FDA disclosure requirements\" are sufficiently pled and, therefore, not preempted.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3817265\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/903/198/#p220\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Desiano v.

Here, Plaintiffs allege freestanding allegations, under state antitrust and consumer protection laws, that are not preempted. For example, the EPPs allege that reverse-payment settlement agreement gives rise to their state claims, which is wholly different from alleging a failure to comply with the FDA. In response, Defendants contend that \"\n   <em>\n    DDAVP\n   </em>\n   unjustifiably narrows the holding of\n   <em>\n    Buckman\n   </em>\n   \" and request that the Court \"decline to follow its holding.\" However, the Court finds the reasoning in\n   <em>\n    DDAVP\n   </em>\n   persuasive.\n   <em>\n    Buckman\n   </em>\n   was concerned that fraud-on-the-FDA claims, based on state law, would interfere with the FDA's statutory scheme; however, to apply that principle to claims unrelated to FDA authority would be to severely limit the theories of relief that parties could seek. As such, this Court finds that the sham citizen petition claim is not preempted by the federal FDA law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   To sum up, the Court declines to dismiss any of Plaintiff's claims based on preemption principles.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

First, Defendants contend that EPPs failed to satisfy the pre-filing notice requirements mandated in states that require the same.
