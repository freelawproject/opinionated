(doing business as Lisa Accessories Factory) (\"Lisa\") and Hong Kong Lizhisha Jewelry Co., Limited (collectively, \"Plaintiffs\") sue Defendant Jjamz, Inc. and its successor company, Defendant Punch Fashions, LLC, to collect outstanding debts. Plaintiffs move for summary judgment. For the reasons that follow, the motion is granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff Yiwu Lizhisha Accessories Co., Ltd. is a corporation headquartered in Zhejiang, China that manufactures and exports jewelry. (Dkt. No. 9 (\"AC\") \u00b6 2.) Plaintiff Hong Kong Lizhisha Jewelry Co., Limited acts as Yiwu Lizhisha's marketing and sales agent. (AC \u00b6 3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Defendant Jjamz is a jewelry wholesaler. (AC \u00b6 12.) In 2015, Jjamz transferred substantially all of its assets, its ongoing business, and certain liabilities to Punch. (Dkt. No. 26-5.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Between 2012 and 2014, Jjamz made over 115 purchases of accessories from Lisa. (AC \u00b6 1.) The invoices on sixty-five of those purchases remain unpaid (in part or whole), amounting to a total debt of $515,966.99. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Dkt. No. 9-1.) Jjamz repeatedly reassured Lisa that the outstanding balance would be paid. (Dkt. Nos. 9-2, 9-3, 9-4, 9-5.) On several occasions, Jjamz paid off individual invoices in part or in full. (Dkt. No. 9-4 at 5.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In January 2015, in response to an e-mail from Lisa, Jjamz explained that it had given up control of the company to investors who were in the process of devising a payment plan. (Dkt. No. 1-5 at 1.) In its\n   contribution and assignment agreement with Jjamz, Punch agreed to \"pay, perform, and discharge when due\" Jjamz's liabilities to Lisa. (Dkt. No. 26-5 at 7; Dkt. No. 26-6 at 20.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Representatives from Jjamz also twice informed Lisa that Punch had assumed all of Jjamz's liabilities. (Dkt. No. 9-6 at 1; Dkt. No. 9-7 at 1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In August 2016, Plaintiffs filed suit against Jjamz seeking to collect payment on its debts. (Dkt. No. 1.) Plaintiffs later amended their complaint to add Punch as a co-defendant. (Dkt. No. 9.) Plaintiffs now move for summary judgment against both Jjamz and Punch. (Dkt.

Lisa undisputedly sent Jjamz invoices, and Jjamz acknowledged receipt. (Dkt. No. 9-2 at 4.) Moreover, on more than one occasion, Lisa informed Jjamz of the outstanding amount owed. (Dkt.

Jjamz did not object in writing to any of the invoices\n   Lisa sent it. To the contrary, Jjamz repeatedly made assurances that it would pay its balance. (Dkt. Nos. 9-2, 9-3, 9-4, 9-5.) The closest Jjamz came to objecting was in a January 17, 2014, email to Lisa explaining, \"I cannot recall promising that we will pay $25,000 per month because I do not make promises I cannot keep!\" (Dkt.

No. 36 at 2;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   AC \u00b6 1.) The Court agrees that, when Jjamz transferred its assets and liabilities to Punch, Punch assumed its predecessor's liabilities as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Section 3(i) of the assignment agreement states: \"[Punch] hereby assumes on the date hereof and agrees to pay, perform, and discharge when due the following obligations of [Jjamz].... [t]he trade accounts payable set forth on Schedule 3(i).\" (Dkt. No. 26-5 at 7.) Schedule 3(i) includes a $494,832 liability owed to Plaintiffs. (Dkt. No. 26-6 at 20.) By its clear text, this provision amounts to express contractual assumption of successor liability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Punch does not meaningfully respond to Plaintiffs' express assumption argument. Instead, Punch points out that the validity of its contract with Jjamz is currently being litigated in state court. (Dkt. No. 29 at 7.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Punch argues that it is not liable for Jjamz's debt to Lisa because \" '[i]t is well established that fraud, misrepresentation or other equitable considerations' can 'prevent recovery under a theory of account stated.' \" (Dkt.

None of these cases, however, addresses the question whether a successor company that is fraudulently induced to assume the\n   <em>\n    legitimate\n   </em>\n   debts of its predecessor can escape liability to the predecessor's creditors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Furthermore, though fraud is one exception to successor liability, the exception is designed to protect only creditors and not successors. \"[T]ransactions undertaken to defraud creditors\" are an exception to \"the rule that an asset purchaser is not liable for the seller's debts.\"\n   <em>\n    Cargo Partner v.

Punch points to no cases, nor does independent research reveal any cases, standing for the proposition that fraud by a predecessor negates a creditor's ability to recover from a successor that has expressly assumed the predecessor's debts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   In short, Punch offers no persuasive reason why its separate litigation against Jjamz is relevant to the issue of successor liability. Punch's contentions are wholly unresponsive to Plaintiffs' argument that Punch expressly agreed to assume Jjamz's liabilities.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Xue Ming Wang\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12264634\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/262/81/#p87\">\n    262 F.Supp.3d at 87\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (A successor is liable when it \"either expressly or impliedly agrees to assume the predecessor's liabilities....\").

(Dkt. No. 29 at 7.) Its legal reasoning as to why the contract is unenforceable is opaque, but some of its factual allegations (\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    Dkt. No. 29 at 2-3), if true, could conceivably support a claim against Jjamz for fraudulent inducement.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Robinson v. Deutsche Bank Tr. Co.

(Dkt. No. 29 at 8-9.) The deadline to complete all discovery in this case was November 17, 2017, and the Court advised the parties that no further extensions would be granted. (Dkt. No. 19.) Plaintiffs filed their summary judgment motion on December 1, 2017, after discovered had closed. (Dkt. No. 24.) As Punch points out, the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure require that parties be \"afforded the\n    <em>\n     opportunity\n    </em>\n    to conduct discovery.\" (Dkt. No. 29 at 8 (emphasis added).) Punch was given that opportunity, and provides no justification for its failure to obtain any necessary discovery within the allotted time period.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
