Upon returning home, the Plaintiff discovered that the Property had been burglarized, with visible signs of a break-in at the rear door. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 15-16. Approximately $200,000 in items were stolen from the Property, including all of the scheduled personal property listed on the Policy in addition to other items of jewelry, and various designer accessories. The crime was reported to the Suffolk County Police Department, Seventh Precinct, and a police report was filed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On October 31, 2016, Mears filed a claim with the Defendants pursuant to the Policy. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 17-20; Exhibit B, Dkt. 11-3, at 2. Allstate conducted its own investigation, which included an examination of the Plaintiff under oath. The Plaintiff provided this examination to Allstate on November 4, 2016. Exhibit B, Dkt. 11-3, at 3. Furthermore, Allstate requested that the Plaintiff provide proof of purchase or appraisals for many of the items purportedly stolen.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201981\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ; Compl. \u00b6 30.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   By letter dated March 28, 2017, Allstate denied the Plaintiff's claim in its entirety.

Further, you have inadequate proof to establish the claimed items in your proof of loss as actually being stolen and owned by you and/or your fianc\u00e9 at the time of the incident. Resultantly, your claim is denied in its entirety. Your proof of loss is rejected.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   Based upon the intentional material misrepresentations as outlined above and based upon the fact that you have inadequate proof of loss for not only the scheduled personal property, but also the unscheduled personal property, you[r] claim is denied in its entirety.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Exhibit B, Dkt. 11-3, at 2-3.

Compl. \u00b6 22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On these facts, the Plaintiff contends that the Defendants discriminated against the Plaintiff because he was an African-American male. Specifically, he alleges that: (1) the \"Defendants' proffered reason for the denial ... together with other statements made by [D]efendants and their agents in the course of discussing the claim demonstrate that the denial was based upon racial animus and/or discrimination;\" (2) the \"[D]efendants do not believe [P]laintiff's veracity about the events as they occurred because he is a black\n   man;\" (3) the \"Defendants have questioned where [P]laintiff obtained the stolen items and how he was able to pay for them;\" (4) \"[i]n spite of [P]laintiff providing proof of purchase and/or appraisals for many of the items, [D]efendants question the validity of those documents;\" and (5) the \"Defendants have no good faith basis for doubting [P]laintiff or the proof he provided, but rather doubt his ability to afford the insured and stolen items simply because he is black.\" Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 27-31.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In the instant motion, the Defendants' arguments focus exclusively on the Plaintiff's first cause of action, a \u00a7 1981 violation, rather than the second cause of action, breach of contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Mears does not specify if he was ever required to disclose his race on any paperwork\n   nor does he provide enough detail to construe any instance where the Defendants may have become aware of his race. An examination of the supporting insurance documents integral to the complaint do not reveal any reference to the fact that the Plaintiff is African-American nor any information that can lead the Court to such a conclusion. For instance, the Plaintiff does not contend that the Plaintiff lives in a predominantly African-American neighborhood, nor that any employee of the Defendants ever interacted with him face-to-face.
