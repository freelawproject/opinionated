INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Plaintiff Sonia Perez (\"Perez\"), on behalf of herself and the putative class members she seeks to represent, alleges that Defendant The Kroger Co.'s (\"Kroger\") use of the statement \"No Sugar Added\" on Kroger Apple Juice\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   violates the Food and Drug Administration (\"FDA\") regulations, specifically\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20101.60\">\n    21 C.F.R. \u00a7 101.60\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(2)(iv). (Second Am. Compl. (\"SAC\") \u00b6\u00b6 1-2, 5-7, ECF. No. 35.) In particular, the FDA regulation sets forth five provisions in which\n   the terms \"no sugar added,\" \"without added sugar,\" or \"no added sugar\" may be used.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20101.60\">\n    21 C.F.R. \u00a7 101.60\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(2). One of the five provisions requires that \"[t]he food that it resembles and for which it substitutes normally contains added sugar.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20101.60\">\n    21 C.F.R. \u00a7 101.60\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(2)(iv). Plaintiff alleges that Kroger Apple Juice violates this provision because Kroger Apple Juice \"does not resemble and substitute for a food that normally contains added sugars.\" (SAC \u00b6 7.) Plaintiff further claims that the \"no sugar added\" label is \"not appropriate to describe foods that do not normally contain added sugars,\" like Kroger Apple Juice, which contains 100% apple juice. (SAC \u00b6 31.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Accordingly, Perez alleges that Kroger's failure to comply with the FDA regulation violates (1) the Unfair Competition Law (\"UCL\") pursuant to California Business and Professions Code section 17200\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   ; (2) the False Advertising Law (\"FAL\") pursuant to California Business and Professions Code section 17500\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   ; and (3) the Consumer's Legal Remedies Act (\"CLRA\") pursuant to California Civil Code section 1750\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   (SAC \u00b6\u00b6 53, 60, 66-74, 75-88.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Kroger moves for summary judgment on all of Perez's causes of action on the basis that there is no violation of the FDA regulation, specifically\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20101.60\">\n    21 C.F.R. \u00a7 101.60\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(2)(iv), which is the underlying violation supporting all of Perez's causes of action.

Kroger urges the Court to defer to the FDA's interpretation of section 101.60(c)(2)(iv).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   For the following reasons, the Court\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS\n   </strong>\n   Kroger's Motion for Summary Judgment.

FACTUAL BACKGRUOND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Perez alleges that in January 2017, she purchased Kroger Apple Juice after reading and relying on the product's \"No Sugar Added\" label. Perez alleges that sugar level is important to her, and she believed that Kroger Apple Juice was healthier than other brands of apple juice because of the \"No Sugar Added\" label. (SAC \u00b6\u00b6 16-18.) Perez claims that she would not have bought Kroger Apple Juice if she had known that similar products contained the same level of sugar. (SAC \u00b6 17.) Perez further claims that without the \"No Sugar Added\" label, she would have either not purchased the product or paid less for it. (SAC \u00b6 20.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Kroger now moves for summary judgment on the basis that the FDA's interpretation of its own regulation,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20101.60\">\n    21 C.F.R. \u00a7 101.60\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c) -that 100% juices can include \"No Sugar Added\" on their labels-is entitled to deference. Kroger further argues that if the correct interpretation of section 101.60(c) allows the \"No Sugar Added\" claim on the label of Kroger Apple Juice, then a state law making the claim unlawful would be preempted. (Mot. 1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    III. REQUEST FOR JUDICIAL NOTICE\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In support of her Opposition, Plaintiff filed a Request for Judicial Notice requesting that the Court take judicial notice of two items. (Req. for Judicial Notice, ECF No. 68-2.) Specifically, Plaintiff requested\n   that the Court take judicial notice of (1) the decision in\n   <em>\n    Sahjigian v.

As such, Perez's causes of action pursuant to the UCL, FAL, and CLRA are preempted because state law cannot impose a requirement that is more burdensome or restrictive than federal law.

(\"Reply\") 10, ECF No. 69.) The Court agrees to the extent\n   that if section 101.60(c)(2) allows the \"No Sugar Added\" claim on Kroger Apple Juice, then a state law making the \"No Sugar Added\" claim unlawful would be preempted.

As such, Perez's claims are not preempted, expressly or impliedly, because Perez is not trying to impose additional requirements beyond the FDA regulations.

Although a different section, Perez believes that section 101.13(d) is applicable because it appears in the \"same volume of the Federal Register\" as section 101.60(c)(2). (Opp'n 5.) There is nothing in the regulation that explicitly supports Perez's position that\n   <extracted-citation index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20101.13\">\n    21 C.F.R. \u00a7 101.13\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d) was intended to apply to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20101.60\">\n    21 C.F.R. \u00a7 101.60\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(2).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, even assuming that section 101.13(d)'s definition and use of the word \"substitute\" applied to section 101.60(c)(2), section 101.13(d) is uninformative. Section 101.13(d) states that a \"substitute food is one that may be used interchangeably with another food that it resembles, i.e., that it is organoleptically, physically, and functionally (including shelf life) similar to, and that it is not nutritionally inferior to unless it is labeled as an imitation.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20101.13\">\n    21 C.F.R. \u00a7 101.13\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d) (internal quotation marks omitted). This definition and use simply changes the question from \"when does a product resemble and substitute for food\" to \"when may a substitute food be used interchangeably with another food.\" Specifically here, what products may be used interchangeably with Kroger Apple Juice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Kroger disputes section 101.13(d)'s applicability and Perez's narrow interpretation of the statute that Kroger Apple can only resemble or substitute for other 100% apple juices. (Mot. 7.) Instead, Kroger argues that the plain language of the statute allows 100% juices to substitute for fruit juices that normally contain sugar. (Reply 5.) Perez argues that section 101.60(c)(2)(iv) allows \"No Sugar Added\" claims on fruit juices only if \"the fruit juice resembles and substitutes for a food ... that normally contains added sugars.\" (Opp'n 8-9.) Perez states that this regulation allows \"No Sugar Added\" claims on juices such as 100% cranberry juice because cranberry juice normally contains added sugars. (Opp'n 9.) As both parties' interpretations are reasonable, the Court finds the disputed phrase to be ambiguous. Accordingly, the Court must now determine whether deference is warranted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    C. The FDA's Interpretation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   In a letter dated May 24, 2017, the Center for Science in the Public Interest (CSPI) wrote to the FDA requesting the FDA take action to enforce\n   <extracted-citation index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20101.60\">\n    21 C.F.R. \u00a7 101.60\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(2)(iv) as to 100% juices. (Decl. of Sarah N. Davis (\"Davis Decl.\") \u00b6 5, Ex. F (\"CSPI Letter\") at 1, ECF Nos. 63-16, 63-22.) Similar to Perez's position, the CSPI Letter asserted that 100% juices do not normally contain added sugar, and as such, labeling 100% juices as \"No Sugar Added\" violates the regulation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The CSPI letter encouraged the FDA to enforce its regulation in the interest of protecting consumers from deceptive labeling. (CSPI Letter at 9.) The CSPI Letter further outlined the harm associated with the practice of labeling 100% juices as \"No Added Sugar\" including the impression that consumers will \"equate such claim with low, or at least moderate, levels of all sugars.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   On August 31, 2017, Douglas Balentine, the director of the FDA's Office of Nutrition and Food Labeling, Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, responded. (Davis Decl. \u00b6 6, Ex. H (\"FDA Letter\"), ECF No. 63-24.) The FDA Letter states that \"firms can label a product as 100% juice if the product contains other ingredients, such as sweeteners or preservatives if the statement is accurate ... and meets FDA's other requirements.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1.) There is no dispute that Kroger Apple Juice is properly labeled 100% apple juice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The FDA Letter also specifically addressed\n   <extracted-citation index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20101.60\">\n    21 C.F.R. \u00a7 101.60\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(2)(iv). In the FDA Letter, the FDA states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   We note that this condition does not limit the \"No Added Sugar\" claim to only very similar foods bearing the same name or the same juice content. For example, juices with no added sugar could substitute for juice with added sugar, fruit-flavored soft drinks sweetened with sugar, or other sugar-sweetened beverages.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The FDA's interpretation is clear and consistent with Kroger's interpretation that Kroger Apple Juice is interchangeable and can substitute for other juices with added sugar, fruit-flavored soft drinks sweetened with sugar, or other sugar-sweetened beverages. Accordingly, if the FDA's interpretation is entitled to\n   <em>\n    Auer\n   </em>\n   deference, Kroger has not violated\n   <extracted-citation index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20101.60\">\n    21 C.F.R. \u00a7 101.60\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(2)(iv).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <strong>\n    a.

(Opp'n 10.) However, both of Perez's arguments are premised on how two sentences in the FDA Letter are inconsistent with section 101.13(d), as described\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , IV.B.a. As the Court previously discussed, section 101.13(d) itself does not assist the Court in interpreting section 101.60(c)(2)(iv). Even adopting section 101.13(d)'s definition, the Court is still left to determine when may a substitute food be used interchangeably with another food. Further, as Kroger explained in its Motion, and Perez failed to address, the NLEA and Inspection Guides define \"substitutes\" in terms of product categories. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mot. 8-9; Reply 8.) Additionally, as addressed at the hearing, section 101.13(j)(1)(i)(A) allows dissimilar foods \"within a product category [to] generally be substituted for one another.\" The FDA Letter also finds support in the agency's regulatory scheme relating to \"100% juice\" labels. The FDA Letter explains that the \"permissibility of the 'No Added Sugar' claim on juices (single strength or 100% juice with or without added ingredients) is consistent with FDA's new definition for added sugars.\" (FDA Letter at 2.) This suggests that the FDA's regulatory scheme takes a broad view of \"substitute,\" consistent with the FDA Letter's guidance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Accordingly, the Court finds that the FDA Letter is not plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation, and is therefore entitled to deference.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <strong>\n    b. The FDA Letter is not a litigation position or rationalization for its lack of enforcement.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Next, Perez claims that the FDA Letter is \"nothing more than a convenient litigating position and rationalization for not enforcing its regulation.\" Perez's argument is based on CSPI's \"strongly worded and detailed letter\" as \"America's Food Watchdog.\" (Opp'n 11.) Perez further presumes that the FDA Letter's \"obvious purpose was to explain why the FDA had decided not to spring into action and take on the juice producers industry-wide at the request of CSPI.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11-12.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Courts will decline to give an agency's interpretation\n   <em>\n    Auer\n   </em>\n   deference when it appears that the interpretation is \"nothing more than a convenient litigating position.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <em>\n    Christopher v. SmithKline Beecham Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407063\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/142/#p155\">\n    567 U.S. 142\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 155,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407063\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/142/#p155\">\n    132 S.Ct. 2156\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407063\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/142/#p155\">\n    183 L.Ed.2d 153\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2012) (internal quotation marks omitted). However, a \"strongly worded and detailed letter\" does not equate to the FDA taking a litigation position. As Kroger notes, no litigation involving the FDA exists, and the Court is unaware of any, such that the FDA would take a \"litigation position\" on this issue. Taking Perez's argument to its logical conclusion would mean that the FDA's response to every letter would result in the FDA taking a litigation position. Perez's argument is unpersuasive. Moreover, the FDA's refusal to take action appears simply consistent with the FDA's past interpretation of the regulation; there was no violation. (FDA Letter at 2 (stating that \"single strength or 100% juices have never been considered to be added sugars in the Dietary Guidelines for Americans\").)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Accordingly,\n   <em>\n    Auer\n   </em>\n   deference to the FDA's interpretation of the regulation is proper.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <strong>\n    VI.

CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Giving deference to the FDA Letter, Kroger Apple Juice complies with section 101.60(c)(2)(iv) in that the FDA allows the \"No Sugar Added\" label on 100% fruit juices where the label is truthful and otherwise conforms with the FDA requirements. Therefore, the Court\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS\n   </strong>\n   Kroger's motion for summary judgment (ECF No. 63) because Kroger Apple Juice's \"No Sugar Added\" claim does not violate federal law, and thus, does not violate the UCL, FAL, or CLRA. The Court will issue judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS SO ORDERED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-66\">\n    As used herein, Kroger 100% Apple Juice, Kroger 100% Natural Apple Juice, and Simple Truth Organic 100% Apple Juice shall collectively be referred to as Kroger Apple Juice.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-67\">\n    Beyond the fact that the regulations appear in the same volume of the Federal Register, the regulations do not refer to each other or otherwise indicate that the definitions are interchangeable.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
