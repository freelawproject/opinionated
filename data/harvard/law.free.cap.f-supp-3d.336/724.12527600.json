Having considered the motions, responses, replies, Plaintiffs' Statement of Undisputed Material Facts, the case file, the arguments of counsel, and the applicable law, the court renders the following.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The amended Anti-Surcharge law provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   (a) In a sale of goods or services, a seller may not impose a surcharge on a buyer who uses a credit card for an extension of credit instead of cash, a check, or a similar means of payment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   (b) This section does not apply to:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   (1) a state agency, county, local governmental entity, or other governmental entity that accepts a credit card for the payment of fees, taxes, or other charges; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   (2) a private school that accepts a credit card for payment of fees or other charges, as provided by Section 111.002.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   (c) This section does not create a cause of action against an individual for violation of this section.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Tex.

Although the law has been amended, it has not substantively changed since this action was filed in 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The undisputed facts are that each merchant would like to tell their customers, without fear of the State enforcing the Anti-Surcharge law, that there is a \"surcharge\" if a customer pays for a purchase with a credit card and that there is \"no additional charge\" if the customer pays with cash or a check. More to the point, the merchants want to say why the surcharge is assessed-because of credit-card swipe fees. Further, the merchants will charge a surcharge that does not exceed the amount of the credit-card swipe fee the merchant pays to a credit-card company.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Also proceeding in tandem with this action are other federal-court cases challenging similar state anti-surcharge laws.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Italian Colors Rest. v.

He is not free to say \"$10, with a 3% credit card surcharge\" or \"$10 plus $0.30 for credit\" because both of those displays identify a single sticker price-$10-that is less than the amount credit card users will be charged.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1151.

Here, the State contends that each of the merchants intends to impose a blanket surcharge on all credit-card purchases. This blanket-surcharge system will thereby provide the merchants with additional profit on certain credit-card purchases, when the fee actually paid to the credit-card issuer is not as large as the surcharge imposed for a particular transaction. Further, the State argues that the customer will not be truthfully informed of what is actually occurring-the customer will be led to believe that the merchants are merely passing along swipe fees when in reality the merchants will be pocketing the additional money collected in excess of the swipe fee charged.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The State's argument holds only if the merchants here seek to impose surcharges that are higher than the swipe fees charged to the merchants by credit-card companies. That, however, is not the merchants' argument. The merchants have made clear since filing this action that the amount of surcharge \"would not exceed the amount of the merchant fees\" that they must pay to credit-card companies. The merchants in this as-applied action are not seeking to extract additional profits by imposing surcharges in excess of the cost of accepting each credit card. Instead the merchants wish \"to prominently and conspicuously display the exact amount of the surcharge, expressed as a percentage of the total price,\" and to limit the amount of the surcharge to the swipe fees incurred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The merchants here have submitted declarations saying that they wish to put up signs stating-\"[f]or example\"-\"a 3% surcharge will be assessed for every credit card purchase.\" The court finds that the submitted declarations are only examples, and that the merchants have made it clear that they will not charge a 3% surcharge if that amount were to exceed the amount of the swipe fees they pay. As the Supreme Court took the plaintiffs at their word in\n   <em>\n    Expressions Hair Design\n   </em>\n   as to the scope of their as-applied challenge, so to will this court in evaluating the constitutionality of Texas's Anti-Surcharge law as applied to the merchants.
