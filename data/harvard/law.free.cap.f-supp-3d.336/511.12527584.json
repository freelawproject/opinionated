Plaintiffs Craig Atkins, Andrew Duren, and Joel Davenport claim that the Borough of Phoenixville and its officials violated their due process rights in concluding that their building, the Pennsylvania House Hotel, was unfit for human habitability. As the Borough's officials discovered, the Hotel suffered from a litany of fire hazards, ranging from gas leaks to broken fire extinguishers. Plaintiffs allege, however, that the Borough failed to give them adequate pre-deprivation notice in deeming the Hotel unfit for habitability and, in any event, failed to provide a post-deprivation remedy. Plaintiffs further aver that PECO, a private utility company, violated their constitutional rights in a similar way by shutting off the Hotel's utilities. Plaintiffs and Defendants have filed motions for summary judgment.

With this in mind, the Court now turns to the undisputed facts of this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    II. FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   From 2003 to 2015, Atkins, Davenport, and Duren owned the Pennsylvania House Hotel in Phoenixville. The Hotel has five levels, including four stories and a basement. The Hotel principally offered units for rent on a weekly basis, and it was usually about 70-80% occupied. During the relevant time period of this dispute, the Hotel was mainly used as a multifamily dwelling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   At some point in November 2014, an unnamed Hotel resident invited David Boelker, Director of Code Enforcement for the Borough of Phoenixville, to examine the premises. The resident expressed some concerns about the Hotel's living conditions, fearing that the property was unsafe for his wife, child, and grandchildren. Along with Michael Baurley, a Building Code Official for the Borough of Phoenixville, Boelker entered the Hotel and took photographs of the premises. The initial inspection was limited to the hallways of the Hotel. Based on what they saw, Boelker concluded that a search warrant was necessary to determine if there were building code violations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   As a result, the Borough applied for an administrative search warrant to examine the Hotel. In the affidavit section, the Borough\n   stated that \"[t]he purpose of said warrant is for establishing proper Heating requirements ... as well as other safety issues with regard to egress, sprinkler systems, electrical panels, proper working bathing facilities.\" The warrant was then signed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In early December 2014, Baurley, Boelker, other building code officers, Harry Weaver of Barry Isett &amp; Associates, Inc. (\"BIA\"), and the Phoenixville Fire Department (including its Chief, John Buckwalter) began inspecting the Hotel.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Phoenixville police officers were also at the scene. After conducting a walk-through, the Fire Department found that several issues plagued the Hotel's residential spaces. Summarizing its findings in a report, the Fire Department noted that there were multiple active gas leaks on the second floor of the hotel. Sprinkler heads were found covered in the common hallways. There was no posted escape plan. There were no functional fire extinguishers. Of the apartments surveyed, the Fire Department discovered that \"the overwhelming majority had missing or nonfunctional smoke detectors.\" One apartment had \"an outlet with what appeared to be burn marks around it from a potential fire incident.\" During his inspection, Chief Buckwalter observed an open flame in the Hotel. In his view, this presented an \"emergency situation\" due to the potential of an explosion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Other areas in the Hotel were similarly hazardous. The basement had no functional exit sign or emergency lighting. Its egress doors were padlocked from the inside. The electrical panels were open and wires were exposed. The smoke detector was inoperable. The Fire Department's report further observed additional fire hazards in the rear office area and ground level commercial space of the Hotel. The office had \"multiple devices plugged into a single outlet.\" Indeed, surge protectors were plugged into other surge protectors, creating an \"electrical octopus.\" The ground level had no working smoke detectors and functional emergency egress lighting. The egress doors were padlocked from the inside. Mattresses were piled against the wall. The sprinkler heads were obscured by construction materials.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Given these myriad problems afflicting the Hotel, it was declared unfit for human habitation on the same day of the inspection. A day afterwards, PECO terminated gas service to the Hotel and removed its electric meters.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   BIA would later complete a report that included findings about the Hotel's compliance with local construction codes. According to the BIA report, the Hotel \"contained no permanent heating facilities.\" The \"central boilers were observed in a state of disrepair.\" The BIA report confirmed the Fire Department's account in several respects as well. It too observed the smell \"indicative of a natural gas leak\" on the second floor. The BIA report also observed \"sprinkler heads that have been obstructed.\" Further, it noted the \"disorderly storage of mattresses, televisions, boxes, and other combustible materials.\" The exit doors on two of the floors were \"found boarded, locked, and equipped with signage forbidding [their] use.\" As for the residential units, a majority of them lacked a \"functioning smoke detector, many without a smoke detector entirely.\" Based on these factual findings and more, the BIA report concluded that the Hotel was uninhabitable and presented unsafe conditions in violation of local building codes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Plaintiffs then sued the Borough, multiple Borough officials, and PECO as well as its employees under Section 1983. For ease of reference, the Borough, and its officials and police officers will be collectively referred to as the \"Borough Defendants.\" Other Borough officials included in this lawsuit are the former Chief of the Phoenixville Police Department, William Mossman; former Mayor of Phoenixville, Michael Speck; and Borough Manager, Jean Krack. Plaintiffs have also sued three Phoenixville police officers - Lance Frost, Kyle Place, and Patrick Mark - who were present at the Hotel during the December inspection. PECO and its employees will be referred to as the \"PECO Defendants.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The gravamen of Plaintiffs' claims is that Defendants did not afford them due process of law in finding that the Hotel was unsuitable for habitability. Plaintiffs have moved for summary judgment, contending that there is no dispute that Defendants violated their constitutional rights. Defendants, in turn, have also filed a motion for summary judgment, seeking dismissal of Plaintiffs' remaining Section 1983 claims.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    III. DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   To succeed, a claim under Section 1983 requires that a defendant, under color of state law, violated a federal right of the plaintiff's.\n   <em>\n    Groman v. Twp. of Manalapan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7410729\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/47/628/#p638\">\n    47 F.3d 628\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 638 (3d Cir. 1995). At issue here are three types of constitutional claims: (1) procedural due process violation based on lack of a pre-deprivation hearing; (2) procedural due process violation based on lack of a post-deprivation remedy; and (3) substantive due process violation. Plaintiff also asserts that the Borough is liable for these constitutional violations under\n   <em>\n    Monell v. Dep't of Soc. Svcs. of City of N.Y.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1490618\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/436/658/\">\n    436 U.S. 658\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1490618\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/436/658/\">\n    98 S.Ct. 2018\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1490618\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/436/658/\">\n    56 L.Ed.2d 611\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1978).

Procedural Due Process Claim for Lack of a Pre-Deprivation Hearing\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <em>\n    i. Against Borough Defendants\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   A claim under Section 1983 for deprivation of procedural due process requires: (1) the deprivation of an individual interest that is encompassed within the Fourteenth Amendment's protection of \"life, liberty, or property\" and (2) the procedures available to the plaintiffs did not provide \"due process of law.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hill v.

As there is no dispute that Plaintiffs were deprived of their property, the sole question is whether they were afforded due process of law. Plaintiffs contend that the Borough Defendants violated their procedural due process rights in deeming the building unfit for habitation without initiating a pre-deprivation hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   As a matter of due process, \"summary administrative action may be justified in emergency situations.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Elsmere Park Club, L.P. v.

The standard is whether there is \"competent evidence supporting the reasonable belief\" that the situation presents an \"emergency\" and whether the defendant's \"actions [are] otherwise 'arbitrary' or an 'abuse of discretion.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 418 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Catanzaro v.

In\n   <em>\n    Elsmere Park\n   </em>\n   , the\n   Third Circuit affirmed a grant of summary judgment against a Section 1983 plaintiff when the town summarily condemned an apartment due to a severe mold problem.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 417-20. As the\n   <em>\n    Elsmere Park\n   </em>\n   court reasoned, the housing complex presented an \"emergency situation\" because the basement apartments \"were overrun with mold,\" and \"several state experts\" noted that the mold \"potentially posed a substantial and immediate threat to the health and welfare\" of the apartment residents.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 419.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The \"emergency situation\" exception applies in this case. The Borough Defendants have adduced competent evidence supporting their reasonable belief that the building conditions presented an emergency situation. It is undisputed that there were tenants living in the building - some of which included senior citizens. It is also undisputed that the Hotel contained various fire hazards: multiple gas leaks, exposed electrical panels, combustible material throughout the Hotel, and one open flame that was personally seen by Chief Buckwalter. There were no functional extinguishers, smoke detectors, or posted exit plan. Some of the egress doors were locked. Given these circumstances, the Borough's officials had a reasonable belief of an emergency situation that threatened the health and welfare of the Hotel residents.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   As the First Circuit has explained in a due process case, \"No one can seriously doubt that emergency conditions may exist (\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     e.g., a severe fire hazard\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ) that would warrant a peremptory shutdown of a residential building.\"\n   <em>\n    Herwins v.

The\n   <em>\n    Elsmere Park\n   </em>\n   court looked to the local code, noting that the plaintiff had an avenue to challenge the condemnations through the town's Board of Adjustment - an appellate forum established as part of the town's zoning code.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 422. Because there was such an \"administrative body empowered to hear [the plaintiff's] appeal,\" as well as \"procedures ... specifically designed to address appeals of condemnation decisions,\" the town's post-deprivation hearing procedure was deemed sufficient.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 423.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   On the facts of this case, the Borough's appeals process was adequate. Insofar as Plaintiffs contend that they lacked notice that the Borough closed down the Hotel in early December, the undisputed facts belie this assertion. According to Section 11-215 of the Phoenixville Borough Code, \"When the Housing Inspector determines that there exists a violation of any provision of this Part, he shall give written notice of such violation to the violator.\" The Borough did so when Baurley sent a letter to Atkins shortly after the Hotel was deemed uninhabitable in early December 2014. The letter cited, among other things, a specific provision of the Borough's code governing designations of dwellings as unfit for human habitation. That provision, Section 11-218 of the Phoenixville Borough Code, stated that when the Housing Inspector \"finds that any dwelling constitutes\n   a serious hazard to the health or safety of the occupants ... he shall designate such dwellings as unfit for human habitation.\" At the latest, Atkins knew about Baurley's letter by late January 2015.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   And, in any case, the Borough posted a large pink sign about the Hotel's inhabitability on its office door, which Davenport saw.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Like the town in\n   <em>\n    Elsmere Park\n   </em>\n   , the Borough provided an appeals process. As Section 11-215 provides, \"Any person aggrieved by a decision or an action of the Housing Inspector may appeal to the Board of Housing Appeals for a review of the decision in accordance with procedures described by the Board of Housing Appeals.\" The same section also notes that when emergency action is taken by the Housing Inspector, priority is given to any appeals of that action. Based on two of the Plaintiffs' deposition testimony, they knew that they could appeal the Borough's decision. Duren conceded that he could \"challenge the condemnation decision of the Borough....\" Atkins was aware of his right to appeal based on correspondence he received from the Borough before the December inspection. Atkins further testified that he conferred with his attorneys - current counsel in this case - to determine the reasons for the Borough's action. Atkins testified at his deposition that he thought his attorneys contacted Borough officials to inquire about the Hotel's shutdown. But it is undisputed that neither Plaintiffs nor their attorneys appealed the Borough's decision. Plaintiffs' briefing does not otherwise explain, with citations to the record, why the Borough's appeals process is insufficient.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(1).
