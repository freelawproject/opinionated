Crabtree, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   This Order addresses the pending Motions to Dismiss in one of the two separate tracks of this MDL-the consumer class cases track. The consumer class track consists of cases filed by individual consumers or third-party payors who allege they purchased EpiPens for consumption by themselves, their families, or their members, employees, insureds, participants, or beneficiaries. After the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation\n   transferred five consumer class cases and one other filed by Sanofi-Aventis U.S. LLC (\"Sanofi\") to our court for coordinated and consolidated proceedings (Docs. 1, 5, &amp; 9), the consumer class plaintiffs filed a Consolidated Class Action Complaint (\"Class Complaint\") (Doc. 60). The Class Complaint asserts federal and state antitrust claims, federal RICO Act violations, various state consumer protection law violations, and unjust enrichment claims. The Class Complaint also seeks class action certification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   The Class Complaint asserts its claims against two groups of defendants who are either sellers or manufacturers of the EpiPen. One group consists of defendants Mylan N.V., Mylan Specialty L.P., Mylan Pharmaceuticals, Inc., and Mylan's CEO Heather Bresch (collectively \"the Mylan Defendants\"). The other group of defendants consists of Pfizer, Inc., King Pharmaceuticals, Inc., and Meridian Medical Technologies, Inc. (collectively \"the Pfizer Defendants\"). When referring to both sets of defendants, this Order simply calls them, collectively, \"defendants.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Defendants have filed separate motions asking the court to dismiss the Class Complaint. Doc. 92 (Pfizer Defendants' Motion to Dismiss Plaintiffs' Consolidated Class Action Complaint); Doc. 94 (Mylan Defendants' Motion to Dismiss Plaintiffs' Consolidated Class Action Complaint). The class plaintiffs have submitted an Omnibus Response to the Motions to Dismiss. Doc. 123. And both sets of defendants have filed Replies. Doc. 216 (Pfizer Defendants' Reply); Doc. 219 (Mylan Defendants' Reply). Also, on March 14, 2018, the Mylan Defendants submitted a Notice of Supplemental Authority under D. Kan. Rule 7.1(f). Doc. 394. The class plaintiffs filed a response, objecting to the supplemental submission. Doc. 403. Then, on July 6, 2018, the class plaintiffs filed a Notice of Supplemental Authority (Doc. 765), and the Mylan Defendants submitted a response to their submission (Doc. 785). On July 11, 2018, the class plaintiffs filed another Notice of Supplemental Authority (Doc. 781), and the Mylan Defendants filed a response to that submission as well (Doc. 803). Finally, on August 12, 2018, the class plaintiffs filed another Notice of Supplemental Authority (Doc. 874), and the Mylan Defendants filed a response to that submission (Doc. 889).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Thus, to say the least, the Motions to Dismiss are now thoroughly and fully briefed. After carefully considering the arguments presented by the parties' filings, the court is prepared to rule.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   For the reasons explained below, the court grants defendants' motions in part and denies them in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The following facts come from the Class Complaint. The court accepts the facts asserted in the Class Complaint as true and views them in the light most favorable to the class plaintiffs.\n   <em>\n    Mayfield v. Bethards\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4326405\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/826/1252/#p1255\">\n    826 F.3d 1252\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1255 (10th Cir. 2016) (citation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The EpiPen\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   is a disposable, prefilled automatic injection device that delivers epinephrine\n   (also known as adrenaline) to treat severe allergic reactions known as anaphylaxis. Anaphylaxis is a life-threatening allergic reaction that can occur rapidly after exposure to an allergen. Anaphylaxis manifests in a variety of symptoms, including swelling of the tongue and throat, vomiting, reduced blood pressure, difficulty breathing, and, if untreated, death. Most commonly, anaphylaxis is caused by food allergens, but medications, latex, insect bites, and other unknown substances also can cause anaphylaxis. About 15 million people have food allergies in the United States. One of every 13 children in the United States has serious food allergies. And, each year, allergic reactions account for some 200,000 emergency room visits. Anaphylaxis is always considered a life-threatening medical emergency.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Epinephrine is used to treat anaphylaxis and is available only by prescription. To treat anaphylaxis effectively, one must administer epinephrine immediately. As little as a thirty minute delay in applying epinephrine can cause death. As a result, patients prone to anaphylaxis are advised to carry an epinephrine auto-injector (\"EAI\") at all times. By doing so, a patient can use the EAI in an emergency when a risk of a severe allergic reaction presents itself.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In 2007, Mylan acquired the right to market and distribute the EpiPen. Pfizer is the exclusive supplier of EpiPens to Mylan. Pfizer provides Mylan with 100% of its EpiPen supply through two of its wholly owned subsidiaries-King Pharmaceuticals, Inc., and Meridian Medical Technologies, Inc.-who manufacture the epinephrine and hold the EpiPen patents. Since at least 2009, Mylan's market share of EAI devices in the United States EAI market has remained above 80%. Since 2009, Mylan's market share consistently has exceeded 90%, and, in 2012, its share was almost 100%. During the same time-and while the cost of the EpiPen's dose of epinephrine has remained about $1-Mylan has increased the EpiPen's price by more than 600%. In 2007, Mylan priced the EpiPen at $100. By 2016, Mylan was charging more than $600. In 2015, Mylan announced that the EpiPen had reached $1 billion in annual sales for the second consecutive year-up from $200 million in 2007.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The Class Complaint alleges that the Mylan and Pfizer Defendants have maintained a monopoly over the EpiPen market and its profitable revenues by devising an illegal scheme to monopolize the market for EAI devices. The Class Complaint asserts that defendants carried out their illegal scheme through several different avenues. The following paragraphs briefly summarize each one, as the Class Complaint describes them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     The Mylan Defendants Paid Pharmacy Benefit Managers (PBMs) to Exclude Competition\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Pharmacy Benefit Managers (\"PBMs\") are third-party administrators of prescription drug programs for commercial health plans, self-insured employer plans, Medicare Part D plans, the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program, and state government employee plans. More specifically, PBMs administer a health coverage provider's prescription benefit program by developing the coverage provider's formulary (the list of prescription benefits included in the coverage at various pricing \"tiers\"), processing claims, creating a network of retail pharmacies who provide discounts in exchange for access to a provider's plan participants, and negotiating with manufacturers. The significant majority of patients with prescription drug insurance coverage receive their benefits through a\n   third-party payor whose drug formulary is determined by a PBM. From 2013 to 2015, commercial third-party payors accounted for about 71% of the EAI drug device market in the United States. So, for a competitor to enter and compete vigorously in the EAI drug device market, it is imperative that it access these third-party payors' drug formularies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Between 2013 and 2015, the Mylan Defendants took advantage of their monopoly power by imposing significant increases in the EpiPen's price. Mylan then used the additional profit margins to offer PBMs significantly higher rebates and percentage discounts conditioned upon exclusive or preferred placement on the PBMs' drug formularies. For example, when Sanofi launched a rival EAI device-Auvi-Q-in 2013, Mylan began taking steps to block Auvi-Q from drug formularies. It did so by offering large rebates to the PBMs who controlled the formularies for third-party payors-30% or higher-and expressly conditioning those rebates on: (a) granting the EpiPen exclusive position on the formulary; and (b) removing (or severely restricting) access to Auvi-Q. Mylan also targeted another rival EAI device-Adrenaclick-with the exclusionary rebate program. Adrenaclick's market share has ranged from only 2% in 2013 to 8% in 2016. Mylan knew that Adrenaclick-as well as Auvi-Q-could not raise prices to inflate their margins sufficiently to offer rebates or discounts similar to those that Mylan was offering to PBMs. In 2014, CVS Caremark added Adrenaclick to its Formulary Drug Removals List, effectively removing a consumer or other end-payor's opportunity to purchase Adrenaclick as an alternative to the EpiPen.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The class plaintiffs allege that the Mylan Defendants' exclusionary rebate scheme deprives patients of a fair price for EAI devices-the price that would result from normal market forces. Instead of lowering its prices to gain market share, Mylan bargains for its market share by providing ever-larger rebates and other kickbacks to PBMs, conditioned on exclusive relationships with those PBMs. Mylan can position itself on the drug formularies by using its monopoly power to charge consumers higher prices for its product. It then can share these revenues with the PBMs (the ones who create the formularies) through substantially enhanced rebates conditioned on excluding insurance coverage for rival products. This conduct, in turn, inflates the prices that consumers pay for the EpiPens so that Mylan can preserve its net realized price and sales volumes. The class plaintiffs contend that the net effect of this scheme harms both consumers and competitors alike.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     The Mylan Defendants Entered into an Exclusive School Access Scheme\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The class plaintiffs next assert that the Mylan Defendants leveraged the EpiPen's dominant market position to foreclose competition in an EAI submarket-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , American public schools. They did so by offering to supply a portion of each school's need for EAI devices on a free or discounted basis but conditioning those discounts on the school entering an exclusive dealing contract. The Mylan Defendants created this important submarket by increasing federal lobbying efforts to gain access to parents, educators, and medical professionals in public schools. As part of the lobbying effort, Mylan spent a reported $4 million specifically lobbying to pass the School Access to Emergency Epinephrine Act. The law was enacted in 2013. It gives federal funding priority to schools who stockpile EAIs. Mylan's lobbying efforts proved enormously successful. Now, a majority of states permit their public schools to stockpile EAIs while eleven states\n   <em>\n    require\n   </em>\n   EAI stockpiling. Given the EpiPen's dominant market position, the Act not only\n   has provided EpiPen access to schools, but also it has mandated some schools to stockpile the product.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   After securing the EAI stockpiling requirement, Mylan acted quickly to exclude competing EAIs from this valuable school submarket. As part of the Mylan Defendants' scheme, Mylan launched the \"EpiPen4Schools\" program. The program gives away free and discounted EpiPens to school districts-ones subject to the new law now requiring (or strongly encouraging) them to stockpile the devices. But Mylan conditioned the free and discounted EpiPens on the schools entering exclusive dealing agreements with Mylan. The purpose of these exclusive dealing agreements was to exclude competitors-like Auvi-Q and Adrenaclick-from the public school submarket. In the fall of 2016, the New York Attorney General and members of the United States Senate announced investigations into the anticompetitive terms of Mylan's EpiPen4Schools program. Later, Mylan eliminated the EpiPen4Schools program's exclusivity requirement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Defendants, Working Together, Used the Judicial and Regulatory Processes to Protect their Monopoly\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The Class Complaint next asserts that the Mylan and Pfizer Defendants worked \"hand-in-hand,\" using patent litigation and the Food and Drug Administration (\"FDA\") regulatory process to erect barriers to market entry and delay EAI competition. Class Compl. \u00b6 314. The Pfizer Defendants own the patents protecting the EpiPen and serve as the contract supplier of the product. The Mylan Defendants own the trademarked brand names and control the worldwide marketing and sale of the product. Together, defendants have a unified interest in protecting the EpiPen monopoly. So, the class plaintiffs allege, defendants collaborated to enhance the EpiPen's sales volume and profitability, fend off competitors, and protect the EpiPen patents by using the judicial and regulatory process to restrain competition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Defendants did so by adding several more patents to the already-patented EpiPen to prevent the launch of competing generics. Defendants have four patents on the EpiPen. According to the class plaintiffs, none of them are designed to enhance the product. Instead, the patents' purposes are to stop generic competitors. Indeed, Mylan CEO Heather Bresch announced during a public earnings call in 2009 that Mylan was adding another patent to the already-patented EpiPen device that \"will also put in another barrier to entry because ... now that market preferential would be the needle protected device and drug of which we have IP and stuff around. So I just think it is a very, very difficult hurdle to get through, and so feel confident that EpiPen is in good shape.\" Class Compl. \u00b6 238. On September 14, 2010, Meridian secured\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=U.S.%20Patent%20No.%207%2C794%2C432\">\n    U.S. Patent No. 7,794,432\n   </extracted-citation>\n   -less than three weeks before Intelliject (the inventor of Auvi-Q) submitted its New Drug Application (\"NDA\") to the FDA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Defendants also worked together to stop generic competition to the EpiPen by filing patent infringement lawsuits. They filed such lawsuits against three generic EpiPen rivals-Sandoz, Teva, and Intelliject-and then entered into anticompetitive settlements with impending generic manufacturers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Teva Settlement\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In December 2008, Teva filed an Abbreviated New Drug Application (\"ANDA\") seeking FDA approval to market a generic EpiPen. In August 2009, Pfizer's subsidiaries-King and Meridian-sued Teva for infringing\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=U.S.%20Patent%20No.%207%2C449%2C012\">\n    U.S. Patent No. 7,449,012\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"the Teva Litigation\"). In November 2010, King and Meridian filed a First Amended Complaint that included a claim for infringing the newly secured '432 patent. Later, King\n   and Meridian dropped their claims based on infringing the '012 patent, leaving only the claims for infringing the '432 patent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   After discovery and a bench trial in March 2012, the parties settled the Teva Litigation on April 27, 2012. According to the class plaintiffs, defendants and Teva entered an unlawful settlement agreement that required Teva to delay launching its generic EAI for three years-until June 22, 2015-in exchange for defendants providing significant consideration, incentives, and benefits to Teva. The Class Complaint lists several facts about the Teva settlement that, the class plaintiffs contend, show defendants made a substantial \"reverse payment\" to Teva to convince it to delay bringing its competing product to market. These facts include:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   \u2022 The court's Markman rulings interpreting the terms of the '432 patent were favorable to Teva.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   \u2022 The parties settled the litigation after completing a full bench trial, meaning that the parties likely would incur marginal litigation expenses going forward, as compared to the expenses already incurred at settlement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   \u2022 No rational economic actor with a viable product (and who had spent millions of dollars developing it) would refrain from entering a lucrative market for 36 months unless it received monetary compensation in exchange for non-entry.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   \u2022 In 2012, the Federal Trade Commission reported seeing \"a record number of settlements involv[ing] potential pay-for-delay agreements,\" and that, in patent settlements involving a \"first-filer\" like Teva, the majority of the settlements involved explicit compensation in return for delayed entry (Class Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 267-68).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   \u2022 On the same day of the Teva settlement, Mylan issued a joint press release announcing the settlement on its own behalf and for Pfizer.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   \u2022 Four days after announcing the Teva settlement, Teva and Mylan settled another lawsuit where Teva had asserted patent infringement claims against Mylan based on Mylan's application to market a generic version of Teva's drug, Nuvigil. With the Nuvigil settlement, Mylan agreed to delay market entry until June 2016. Like the EpiPen, Nuvigil had annual sales hovering near $1 billion. So, procuring delayed entry of generics for both Nuvigil and the EpiPen was valuable to all parties involved.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   \u2022 The Teva settlement has come under congressional scrutiny as a \"pay-for-delay\" agreement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   During the same time period, the Teva settlement also prevented competition from any other generic EAI device. Defendants knew that their agreement with Teva would delay market entry because Teva was subject to the Hatch-Waxman Act's 180-day exclusivity award. This provision grants a six-month exclusivity period to the first generic to challenge a brand firm's patent, claiming it is invalid or not infringed. The exclusivity period begins when the first-filing generic enters the market. Here, Teva was the first filer. So, with Teva delaying its market entry under the parties' settlement, Teva's exclusivity period could not begin running until at least three years in the future. As a result, defendants delayed all generics seeking ANDA applications based on the EpiPen.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   In a public earnings call, Mylan's CEO Heather Bresch described how the Teva settlement had delayed market competition. Also, she appeared to concede that Mylan had participated in the Teva settlement. In July 2012, she stated publicly: \"So we certainly have seen a benefit [to growing the EpiPen market] and obviously,\n   now with the runway absolutely clear for us through 2015, through\n   <em>\n    our\n   </em>\n   settlement with Teva, I can assure you, we are going to continue as we see [the] response continue to invest in EpiPen as a franchise.\" Class Compl. \u00b6 277 (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Intelliject Settlement\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Defendants initiated another patent lawsuit against Intelliject-the inventor of Auvi-Q-when Intelliject sought FDA approval for its competing EAI. In 2009, Sanofi announced it had acquired the rights to Intelliject's EAI and that under its license, Sanofi would manufacture and commercialize the product while Intelliject would continue developing the product and work to secure regulatory approval. On January 11, 2011, defendants-through King-filed a patent infringement lawsuit against Intelliject seeking to block FDA approval of its NDA for its product-one that later became known as Auvi-Q. King's lawsuit alleged that Intelliject's EAI infringed the '432 patent -a patent that Meridian secured more than a year after Intelliject began developing its product and less than three weeks before Intelliject filed its NDA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   On August 1, 2011-less than eight months after King filed its lawsuit-the FDA announced that it was giving Intelliject's EAI tentative final approval, pending resolution of the patent litigation that King filed. Six months later, the parties announced that they had settled the Intelliject litigation. Again, Mylan announced the settlement jointly for itself and Pfizer. Although the parties did not make public the specific terms of the agreement, they announced that the agreement prevented Intelliject and Sanofi from launching their EAI product for another nine months-until November 15, 2012. Intelliject and Sanofi made the agreement not to enter the market until November 15, 2012, in exchange for valuable consideration. Through the Intelliject litigation, defendants effectively blocked competition from Intelliject's competing device for almost two years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Sandoz Settlement\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   In 2010, another EAI competitor-Sandoz, Inc. (\"Sandoz\")-attempted to enter the EAI market by filing an ANDA for its own generic EpiPen alternative. Similar to the other lawsuits against Teva and Intelliject, defendants-through King-filed a patent infringement suit against Sandoz. According to the class plaintiffs, defendants' approach to Sandoz was to stall its ANDA by staying the action. The court administratively terminated the Sandoz litigation, giving the parties the ability to reopen the case by letter request. No party has reopened the case. So, to date, Sandoz's FDA approval and any definitive ruling on the EpiPen patents are stayed indefinitely. The class plaintiffs allege that defendants entered an agreement with Sandoz to stay the case in exchange for valuable consideration paid to Sandoz.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     FDA Citizen Petition\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The Class Complaint next alleges that, with Teva's generic EAI entry into the market looming, defendants took another step to block generic competition from the market by filing an FDA Citizen Petition. An FDA Citizen Petition provides the public with an avenue to present safety concerns to the FDA. But here, the class plaintiffs allege, defendants used the FDA Citizen Petition process to delay-further-Teva's entry into the market and to prevent Teva's product from competing with the EpiPen.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   On January 16, 2015, Mylan filed a Citizen Petition \"a mere six months before Teva was scheduled (pursuant to the settlement) to enter the market.\" Class Compl. \u00b6 311. Antitrust scholar Michael Carrier of Rutgers Law School described Mylan's Petition in this fashion:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   In its petition, Mylan contended that Teva should be required to demonstrate that its product was the \"same as\" Mylan's EpiPen. In other words, even though the parties had already agreed through settlement to delay Teva's generic entry for more than three years, Mylan sought to further delay the entry of Teva's generic through its citizen petition.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   In addition to its January 2015 petition, the company waited almost five months after filing and only weeks before the FDA was required to respond, until May 2015, to supplement its petition with a 48-page independent study purportedly showing that patients would not use Teva's generic product correctly.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   Given that Teva's generic product had been in development for at least six years before the petition's filing, this late-filing of a supplemental study implicates significant timing questions. Why would such a study be submitted only weeks before the FDA was required to respond under the FDA's 150-day clock?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=U.S.%20Patent%20No.%207%2C449%2C012\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting Michael A. Carrier &amp; Daryl Wander,\n   <em>\n    Citizen Petitions: An Empirical Study\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=34%20Cardozo%20L.%20Rev.%20249\">\n    34 Cardozo L. Rev. 249\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 279 (2012) ). According to the class plaintiffs, Mylan's submissions to the FDA rested on fundamentally flawed studies and the medical opinions of a doctor whom Mylan had paid some $95,000 in fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   According to the class plaintiffs, without defendants' use of the FDA Citizen Petition process, Teva would have entered the market much sooner after addressing any FDA concerns and securing FDA approval. The class plaintiffs also assert that, from 2009 to present, defendants' actions deterred not only Teva, but also many more potential generics companies from developing and launching competing products.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Defendants Implement a Pricing Scheme\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The Class Complaint next alleges that the Mylan Defendants implemented a pricing scheme that defrauded U.S. consumers into paying an inflated price for the EpiPen-one that climbed by more than 500%. The Mylan Defendants allegedly implemented this pricing scheme working alongside PBMs. Mylan is a generics company that typically makes low margins on drug sales. But the EpiPen-a specialty branded drug-represented a unique and highly profitable revenue stream for Mylan. Recognizing this opportunity, Mylan CEO Heather Bresch and other executives decided to exploit the EpiPen to generate billions of dollars in revenue for Mylan. According to the class plaintiffs, the Mylan Defendants and the PBMs distracted consumers and regulators from the reality that defendants were raising the price of the EpiPen from $100 to $600 by launching a campaign of false and misleading statements and actions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   One of the ways that the Mylan Defendants allegedly implemented their pricing scheme was changing the way Mylan sold the EpiPen. On August 24, 2011, Mylan announced that it no longer would sell individual EpiPens in the U.S. Instead, Mylan forced U.S. consumers to purchase EpiPens in pairs with the EpiPen 2-Pak. The class plaintiffs refer to this change as the \"hard switch.\" And the class plaintiffs allege that the \"hard switch\" forced consumers and third-party payors to overpay for the EpiPen 2-Pak because the switch, in effect, doubled the EpiPen's price.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   From 1987 to 2011, Mylan and others had sold the EpiPen one at a time in the U.S. without incident. Nothing changed in 2011 that required Mylan to sell the EpiPen as a 2-Pak. The EpiPen 2-Pak is just two individual EpiPens connected by a grey piece of plastic. The class plaintiffs\n   allege that no medical reason exists to force customers to purchase a 2-Pak instead of a single EpiPen. Instead, Mylan deceptively suggested that the 2-Pak was medically required even though EpiPens are sold individually in every other country besides the United States. Also, Mylan's packaging offers no medical instructions or guidelines for patients to know whether, or when, to administer the second back-up EpiPen.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Beginning in 2011, Mylan began raising the price of the EpiPen while forcing customers to buy EpiPens in the 2-Pak. In October 2011, Mylan increased the price of an EpiPen 2-Pak to $181. And by May 2016, the price of an EpiPen 2-Pak jumped to $608.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     The Mylan Defendants Have Made Various Misrepresentations and Omissions in an Effort to Conceal Their Anticompetitive Conduct\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Finally, the Class Complaint alleges that the Mylan Defendants have spread false and misleading information and omitted material information as part of their scheme to monopolize the EAI market. They spread, the Class Complaint alleges, four broad categories of false and misleading information.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <em>\n    First\n   </em>\n   , the class plaintiffs allege, Mylan created and spread misinformation about a competing EAI device-Auvi-Q. Although the FDA had determined that the epinephrine in Auvi-Q is a bioequivalent to the epinephrine in the EpiPen, Mylan funded and promoted a study entitled, \"Auvi-Q versus EpiPen Auto-Injectors: Failure to Demonstrate Bioequivalence of Epinephrine Delivery Based on Partial Area Under the Curve.\" Class Compl. \u00b6 229. Mylan intended the study to undermine the FDA's conclusion that Auvi-Q had demonstrated bioequivalence to the epinephrine in the EpiPen-in direct contradiction to the FDA's conclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   The class plaintiffs also allege that Mylan made false and misleading statements about Auvi-Q's formulary status. According to the class plaintiffs, Mylan's anticompetitive conduct caused major health plans either to limit their coverage of Auvi-Q or to exclude Auvi-Q from coverage altogether. Mylan did so by paying formularies to exclude Auvi-Q from coverage. But then, Mylan marketed to physicians the fact that Auvi-Q was not covered by formularies and suggested that the decision to exclude Auvi-Q from coverage was based on clinical recommendations-and not Mylan's large, conditional rebate offers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   <em>\n    Second\n   </em>\n   , the class plaintiffs allege that Mylan made false and misleading statements about the \"hard switch\" to the EpiPen 2-Pak. On August 24, 2011, Mylan issued a news release entitled \"Dey Pharma to Offer EpiPen 2-Pak and EpiPen Jr 2-Pak Exclusively.\" Class Compl. \u00b6 336. The press release's subheadline provided: \"Decision aligns with recent clinical guidelines for patients at risk for or who have experienced anaphylaxis to have immediate access to two doses of epinephrine.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=34%20Cardozo%20L.%20Rev.%20249\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Class Complaint alleges that the press release was fraudulent and misleading for several reasons. They include:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   \u2022 The press release cited a National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (\"NIAID\") study that did not apply to the general population. Instead, it applied only to a narrow subset: allergy sufferers who had already (1) been hospitalized for (2) a food allergy.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   \u2022 Mylan purported to rely on the World Allergy Organization (\"WAO\") global standard in making the switch, but Mylan did not require sale of the EpiPen 2-Pak globally. Indeed, the press release states that the single EpiPen Auto-Injector\n   package configuration will remain available outside of the U.S.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   \u2022 The switch to the 2-Pak did not change patient access to two doses of epinephrine. Doctors could write, and often did write, prescriptions for two EpiPens. So, no need existed for Mylan to mandate something patients could purchase already.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   \u2022 The medical guidelines recited did not state that providers must sell two doses of epinephrine. Instead, Mylan used the WAO's vague statement as a false pretext for selling only the 2-Pak.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   \u2022 No mandates required Mylan to sell the EpiPen exclusively as a 2-Pak, or not at all.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   \u2022 No medical studies support the decision to sell the EpiPen exclusively as a 2-Pak.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   \u2022 From 1987 until 2011, the EpiPen was sold individually without incident. Nothing changed suddenly in 2011 that required Mylan to sell only the 2-Pak.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n   \u2022 When Mylan switched to the 2-Pak in 2011, it did not order a recall or insist that all U.S. EpiPen patients immediately go buy a second EpiPen.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   \u2022 Although the press release relies on the WAO, the U.S. is the only country where Mylan required customers to purchase a 2-Pak of the EpiPen.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-73\">\n   \u2022 According to a study conducted by the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma &amp; Immunology, only a small number of patients require a second dose. The reason for selling the device solely in packs of two is to account for user error due to the imperfect product design,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , 14% of parents accidently stick the needle in their own thumb instead of in their child's leg.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-74\">\n   \u2022 Mylan offers no medical guidelines or instructions to EpiPen 2-Pak consumers in its packaging or on the device to explain how or when to use (or even how to store) the second EpiPen in the 2-Pak.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-75\">\n   \u2022 Mylan states that between 1-20% of patients might need a second device. But, according to class plaintiffs, the margin of 1-20% is so wide that it is meaningless and provides a false justification for the \"hard switch\" to the 2-Pak.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Class Compl. \u00b6 339. The class plaintiffs also allege that the NIAID panel Mylan relied on to justify the change to the 2-Pak was influenced and tainted by Mylan's financial contributions. The August 24, 2011, press release quotes Dr. Phillip Lieberman, a member of the NIAID panel, as stating that up to 20% of patients will require more than one dose of epinephrine to relieve symptoms. According to the class plaintiffs, Dr. Lieberman's statement does not explain why a 2-Pak is necessary for 100% of patients when only \"up to 20%\" require more than one dose. Also, his statement never explains why all patients must purchase two EpiPens instead of having a prescription that allows two doses. The class plaintiffs allege that Dr. Lieberman made his statement justifying the switch to the 2-Pak because Mylan paid him to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   <em>\n    Third\n   </em>\n   , the class plaintiffs allege, Mylan made false statements about coupons, rebates, and generics. Mylan has stated publicly on its website and to the media throughout at least 2016 that 80% of consumers with insurance pay nothing for the EpiPen. According to the class plaintiffs, this statement is false because third-party payors end up paying the bulk of the cost for the EpiPen and, in turn, the third-party payors pass on the costs to patients with increased premiums. Mylan also announced\n   recently that it will begin offering a $300 generic version of the EpiPen. The class plaintiffs assert that Mylan's admission that it can make a $300 generic using the same factories and components used to make the $600 EpiPen shows that Mylan is price gouging consumers with its current list price for the EpiPen.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   <em>\n    Finally\n   </em>\n   , the Class Complaint alleges that Mylan made false statements to Congress under oath to help cover up its fraud and to deceive the public about the EpiPen price increases. The Class Complaint asserts that CEO Heather Bresch falsely testified to Congress on September 21, 2016, when she: (1) misrepresented Mylan's profit on the EpiPen as $50 per device, but, according to a\n   <em>\n    Wall Street Journal\n   </em>\n   article, Mylan's profits were 60% higher than that amount; (2) misrepresented that Mylan had invested more than $1 billion in the EpiPen when, in fact, Mylan acquired the EpiPen in 2007 without incurring any research and development expenses; (3) misrepresented that Mylan had provided free EpiPens to more than 66,000 U.S. schools with \"no strings attached,\" but Mylan, in fact, did attach strings to the free EpiPens by requiring the schools to sign a contract agreeing not to purchase any products from Mylan's competitors for a twelve-month period; (4) misrepresented that Mylan had reduced U.S. healthcare costs by about $180 billion; and (5) mispresented that 85% of EpiPen patients pay less than $100 for a 2-Pak and a majority pay less than $50.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Class Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 575-79. The Class Complaint describes how Mylan and others sold the EpiPen individually in the U.S. from 1987 to 2011 without incident. But, in 2011, Mylan imposed the \"hard switch,\" requiring patients to purchase EpiPens in pairs in the EpiPen 2-Pak.

The Mylan Defendants assert\n   that the two products thus are interchangeable. For example, a patient could use either one of the two EpiPens in a 2-Pak as the primary device and the other one as the back-up device. The Mylan Defendants thus argue that it is not plausible that the primary EAI device and backup EAI device belong to separate markets. Indeed, the Tenth Circuit has defined the \"relevant product market in any given case\" as one \" 'composed of products that have reasonable\n   <em>\n    interchangeability\n   </em>\n   for the purposes for which they are produced-price, use and qualities considered.' \"\n   <em>\n    Buccaneer Energy (USA) Inc. v.

Although the two products here have the same qualities, the Class Complaint defines how patients\n   <em>\n    use\n   </em>\n   them in a functional sense as two separate products.

These allegations are sufficient to state a claim at this stage of the litigation. Ultimately, to prevail on their tying claim, the class plaintiffs must adduce admissible evidence to support a reasonable finding that two separate product markets exist. But, to survive the Motions to Dismiss, plaintiffs need only make plausible factual allegations of two different product markets.

Defendants offer five arguments to support their assertion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   <em>\n    First\n   </em>\n   , the Mylan Defendants argue, the Class Complaint never alleges that Mylan's rebates and discount offers resulted in EpiPen prices below the cost of their production. Six days after the Mylan Defendants filed their Motions to Dismiss the Class Complaint, the court issued a Memorandum and Order in the other of the two separate tracks in this MDL-the Sanofi track. The court's Order granted Mylan's Motion to Dismiss the\n   <em>\n    Sanofi\n   </em>\n   Complaint in part, and denied that motion in part (\"the\n   <em>\n    Sanofi\n   </em>\n   Order\"). Doc. 98. In the\n   <em>\n    Sanofi\n   </em>\n   Order, the court rejected the same argument asserted here-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , that Sanofi's exclusive dealing claims fail as a matter of\n   law because the\n   <em>\n    Sanofi\n   </em>\n   Complaint never alleges that Mylan's rebate offers resulted in prices that were below its costs to produce the EpiPen.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 10-15. The court recognized that the price-cost test does not apply to bar exclusive dealing claims when price itself is not the clearly predominant mechanism of exclusion.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12-13 (citing\n   <em>\n    ZF Meritor, LLC v.

And, viewing the allegations in Sanofi's favor, the court concluded that the\n   <em>\n    Sanofi\n   </em>\n   Complaint \"does not rely 'solely on the exclusionary effect of [Mylan's] prices' to support its exclusive dealing claim based on Mylan's rebate program.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13 (quoting\n   <em>\n    ZF Meritor\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5865946\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/696/254/#p277\">\n    696 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   277 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   The same is true of the Class Complaint.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Class Complaint alleges that Mylan leveraged its greater-than-90% market share by offering large rebates to PBMs to exclude Auvi-Q from the formularies. Class Compl. \u00b6 177. The Class Complaint asserts that no legitimate business reason existed for Mylan's deep conditional rebates except blocking Auvi-Q from the market.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 178. Also, it asserts that Mylan's rebates effectively prevented competitors from accessing formularies of the two largest PBMs-Express Scripts and CVS Caremark-that combine to cover more than 50% of the PBM market in the United States.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 162, 168. The Class Complaint alleges that Mylan's conditional rebates unlawfully increased Sanofi's cost to enter the market if it wanted to match Mylan's rebates.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 182. And, the Class Complaint alleges, after Mylan successfully excluded Auvi-Q from coverage, it sent misleading marketing materials to physicians asserting that EpiPen was the \"preferred\" EAI device for 99% of patients while Auvi-Q was \"preferred\" for only 2% of patients. According to the class plaintiffs, the marketing materials suggested that the reason for Auvi-Q's exclusion was based on clinical recommendations-and not the large, conditional rebate offers.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 232-35. These allegations assert that Mylan's rebate program involved anticompetitive conduct-beyond pricing itself-that was designed to exclude competition in the EAI drug market.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   <em>\n    Second\n   </em>\n   , the Mylan Defendants contend that the Class Complaint never alleges that Mylan's rebates harmed the class plaintiffs by excluding Auvi-Q from the market because Sanofi's decision not to compete with the EpiPen was based on other factors, all unrelated to Mylan's conduct. The Mylan Defendants cite a paragraph from the\n   <em>\n    Sanofi\n   </em>\n   Complaint asserting that Sanofi voluntarily recalled Auvi-Q in October 2015 following reports of manufacturing issues. Doc. 95 at 44. But, as the court concluded in the\n   <em>\n    Sanofi\n   </em>\n   Order, the\n   <em>\n    Sanofi\n   </em>\n   Complaint plausibly alleges that Mylan's conduct forced Sanofi to exit the EAI drug market. Doc. 98 at 40. The Class Complaint contains similar allegations. As the court already has held, Mylan's arguments that the voluntary recall-and not Mylan's alleged anticompetitive conduct-caused Sanofi's injuries present a factual dispute that the court cannot resolve on a motion to dismiss.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   For the same reasons as the\n   <em>\n    Sanofi\n   </em>\n   Order discussed, the court declines to dismiss the class plaintiffs' exclusive dealing claims based on Mylan's argument that Sanofi's decision to exit the EAI market was based on factors other than Mylan's anticompetitive conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   <em>\n    Third\n   </em>\n   , the Mylan Defendants assert that the Class Complaint never alleges that Mylan's exclusive dealing contracts harmed competition. The court rejected this same argument in the\n   <em>\n    Sanofi\n   </em>\n   Order. It rejects it again here for the same reasons. The Class Complaint, construed in favor of the class plaintiffs, plausibly alleges that Mylan's anticompetitive conduct harmed competition. The Class Complaint alleges that defendants implemented a pricing scheme that raised the price of the EpiPen from a little over $100 for two EpiPens in 2007 to more than $600 for the same two EpiPens in 2016. Class Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 349-60. According to the class plaintiffs, the price increases allowed Mylan to share its monopoly profits with PBMs through larger rebates for excluding competing products.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 165-66. Mylan's exclusionary contracts then prevented consumers in a substantial share of the market from accessing or choosing competing EAI devices such as the Auvi-Q and others.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 168, 491. These allegations, if true, are capable of supporting a finding or inference of harm to competition, and thus, they state a plausible antitrust claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   <em>\n    Fourth\n   </em>\n   , the Mylan Defendants assert that the class plaintiffs' claims based on discounts or rebates Mylan offered to states or state agencies are barred by the\n   <em>\n    Noerr\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    -Pennington\n   </em>\n   doctrine.

First, the class plaintiffs contend that their antitrust claims are premised on Mylan's misclassification of the EpiPen and that this misclassification influenced decisions by state-based Medicaid agencies to exclude Auvi-Q.

Instead, the allegation refers generally to \"benefit managers.\" And it recites that these benefit managers continued to \"favor\" the EpiPen over competitors. Also, the allegation asserts that the benefit managers knew about the misclassification and thus anticipated a large make-up payment when Mylan was forced to reclassify the EpiPen. Thus, according to the allegation, the benefit managers never made their decisions based on any false representations that Mylan made to them. To the contrary, the allegation asserts that the benefit managers understood that Mylan had misclassified the EpiPen. So, nothing about the misclassification affected the decision-making abilities of benefit managers when they chose which EAI devices to include in the formularies. Construed in the class plaintiffs' favor, the exclusive dealing allegations based on Mylan's discounts or rebates to state-based Medicaid agencies assert that Mylan's conduct violated the antitrust laws by offering the rebates in exchange for exclusivity. The\n   <em>\n    Noerr\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    -Pennington\n   </em>\n   doctrine precludes liability for this type of conduct, even if the intent was to exclude competition.

Indeed, our court has recognized that\n   <em>\n    Tampa Electric\n   </em>\n   provides a \"number of other factors which may be relevant to a rule of reason analysis in an exclusive dealing claim,\" and thus it has refused to \"decide at the pleading stage that plaintiff had failed to plead adequate foreclosure levels\" to state an exclusive dealing claim.\n   <em>\n    Suture Express, Inc. v.

The court cannot engage in such an analysis at the pleading stage. Instead, the court considers the Class Complaint's allegations in the light most favorable to the class plaintiffs.

Second, defendants contend, these potential competitors could not enter the market lawfully without infringing Pfizer's EpiPen device patents-ones that don't expire until 2025. The class plaintiffs respond, asserting that both arguments require\n   the court to make factual determinations-something it cannot do on a motion to dismiss.

The court agrees with them, for reasons explained below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   In response to defendants' first argument, the class plaintiffs concede that the Class Complaint recites that Teva and Sandoz never secured FDA approval for their competing EAI devices.

The class plaintiffs have alleged that defendants' reverse payment settlements delayed competing products-not only from entering the market but from securing FDA approval.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Class Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 302, 319, 322.

The class plaintiffs contend that, without defendants' alleged unlawful settlements, defendants faced a high probability of generic competition because it was likely that the courts would find the patents invalid or conclude that the generic competing devices were non-infringing. Indeed, the Class Complaint alleges that \"given the trial court's previous rulings [in the Teva Litigation] it requires no great leap to infer that, had the parties waited for a decision, the '432 patent would have been found invalid.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 284.

These alleged facts include: (1) the trial court issued Markman rulings interpreting the '432 patent favorable to Teva; (2) the parties settled after the trial court had held a full bench trial, meaning that the parties' additional litigation expenses were minimal compared to the expenses they already had incurred when they settled; and (3) \"[n]o rational economic actor with a viable product (and who had spent millions of dollars developing it) would refrain from entering a lucrative 'blockbuster' market for 36 months unless\n   it received monetary compensation in exchange for non-entry.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 265.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   Defendants assert that these allegations fail to state a plausible claim because they merely speculate that a generic would have proved invalidity or non-infringement in a patent lawsuit.

With this argument, defendants again ask the court to weigh disputed factual allegations. The court cannot engage in such fact-finding on a motion to dismiss.

Indeed, one also could infer the opposite conclusion-that Sandoz agreed to stay its ANDA application because it considered the patent infringement claims valid and appreciated the risk that it would lose the patent infringement litigation. But, at the pleading stage, the court cannot make that determination. Instead, the court must consider the facts alleged in the class plaintiffs' favor and draw reasonable inferences from them. Applying that standard here, the court concludes that the class plaintiffs have asserted a plausible antitrust claim based on their allegations that the Sandoz settlement involved an unlawful reverse payment settlement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   <strong>\n    6.

The court found that plaintiff's Complaint alleged several of the factors required to overtake the\n   <em>\n    de minimis\n   </em>\n   presumption-including that the letter was clearly false, clearly material, and clearly likely to induce reasonable reliance.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4331476\" index=\"228\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/797/1248/#p1269\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   But the court also agreed with defendant: plaintiff had not alleged other certain factors because the Complaint asserted that defendant sent the letter to pharmacists-persons likely to have knowledge about the subject matter-and that defendant only could have made the misrepresentations for a short time period.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 917.

The class plaintiffs allege that Mylan: (1) created and spread misinformation about the Auvi-Q and its bioequivalence to the EpiPen; (2) funded and promoted a study that was intended to undermine the FDA's conclusion that Auvi-Q demonstrated bioequivalence to the epinephrine in the EpiPen; and (3) made misleading statements to physicians that the EpiPen was the \"preferred\" brand based on Auvi-Q's coverage exclusions when Mylan itself produced the exclusion with its large, conditional rebate offers. Class Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 229, 232-34. The class plaintiffs assert that these allegedly false and misleading statements blocked Auvi-Q from competing in the market, thus excluding competition.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 229-31, 235.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-179\">\n   The Mylan Defendants contend that the class plaintiffs' allegations fail to assert that Mylan's allegedly deceptive statements were \"clearly false,\" as the first factor of the six-factor test requires. The court disagrees. One plausibly can infer from the Class Complaint's allegations that Mylan's statements about Auvi-Q were clearly false. Although the Class Complaint does not use those precise words, it calls the statements \"misinformation\" and so \"misleading\" that they \"ensur[ed] that physicians would think that the EpiPen was the only realistic choice for their patients.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 229, 234-35. Of course, to prevail on their speech-based claims, the class plaintiffs must come forward with evidence showing that these alleged statements produced anticompetitive effects in violation of the antitrust laws. But, at the pleading stage, the court applies\n   <em>\n    Ayerst\n   </em>\n   's rationale and concludes that the class plaintiffs \"should be allowed to go forward with the discovery process to substantiate [their] claim\" that Mylan's allegedly deceptive speech violated the antitrust laws.\n   <em>\n    Ayerst Labs.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1792526\" index=\"229\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/850/904/#p916\">\n    850 F.2d at 917\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-180\">\n   Also, following\n   <em>\n    Ayerst\n   </em>\n   , the court need not decide whether the Class Complaint alleges facts capable of supporting each factor before it could overtake the\n   <em>\n    de minimis\n   </em>\n   presumption. The\n   <em>\n    Ayerst\n   </em>\n   plaintiff did\n   not satisfy such an obligation at the pleading stage. The court finds persuasive\n   <em>\n    Ayerst\n   </em>\n   's conclusion that these factors require factual development through the discovery process.

But, construing the Class Complaint as describing just \"routine business relationships\" requires the court to draw inferences against the class plaintiffs' allegations. And that is not a proper endeavor for the court on a motion to dismiss. Instead, the court must take plaintiffs' allegations as true and view them in the light most favorable to the class plaintiffs.\n   <em>\n    Mayfield v.

Applying that standard, one plausibly can infer from the Class Complaint's allegations that the Mylan and Pfizer Defendants-persons or entities associated with the enterprise-formed relationships sufficient to satisfy the pleading requirements for a RICO enterprise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-212\">\n   Defendants also argue that the class plaintiffs' allegations about PBMs fail to allege adequately their participation in a RICO enterprise. The Class Complaint alleges, during the past decade, \"the PBM Conspirators and other PBMs began to exert influence in their role as insurance-industry middle-men to dictate the success or failure of certain drugs in the marketplace by offering to include or threatening to exclude certain medications from some or all of their formularies and, in the process, extracting hundreds of millions of dollars in the form of 'discounts' or 'rebate'\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-213\">\n   payments from drug manufacturers in exchange.\" Class Compl. \u00b6 636. The class plaintiffs assert that PBMs and drug manufacturers engage in negotiations during \"complex, closed-door meetings, during which PBMs sell access to their formularies in exchange for large rebates or discounts, a substantial portion of which they pocket as pure profit.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 637. During those negotiations, the class plaintiffs contend, the RICO Defendants \"participated in a scheme\n   <em>\n    with the PBM Conspirators\n   </em>\n   to increase the list price of the EpiPen.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 638 (emphasis added). The purpose of the RICO Defendants' scheme was to \"[t]o facilitate the payment of 'rebates' to PBMs, and ensure their position on certain formularies without impacting their bottom line.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   And also, the scheme \"increase[d] the profits of PBMs through artificially increasing the list price of EpiPens\" to the detriment of consumers.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 639.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-214\">\n   The Class Complaint describes how the RICO Defendants and PBM Conspirators advanced the goals of the EpiPen Pricing Enterprise allegedly by \"affirmatively misrepresent[ing] or conceal[ing] the existence of the inflated and fraudulent nature of these list price increases as well as the existence, amount, and purpose of the discounts given to the PBM Conspirators to Plaintiffs, the Classes, consumers, health care payers, and the general public.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 641. Also, the Class Complaint alleges that the PBM Conspirators \"exerted substantial control over the EpiPen Pricing Enterprise, and participated in the affairs of the enterprise\" through a variety of specific actions.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 651. This conduct includes the PBM Conspirators' negotiating and offering to discount the EpiPen; misrepresenting and concealing the existence, amount, and purpose of the EpiPen discounts; misrepresenting and concealing the true nature of the relationship and agreements between the enterprise's members as well as its effect on the pricing of the EpiPen; and, ensuring that the other RICO Defendants and members of the EpiPen Pricing Enterprise concealed the fraudulent scheme.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-215\">\n   Defendants characterize these allegations as \"[a] commercial negotiation, where the parties have their own independent business interests and one party demands higher rebates and lower prices from the other.\" Doc. 95 at 69. And, they contend, \"[t]o recognize a RICO enterprise here would be tantamount to holding that negotiating strategies by PBMs, insurers, state Medicaid agencies, and other healthcare payors throughout the U.S. amount to organized criminal conduct-which obviously cannot be, and is not, the law.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Perhaps a factfinder would accredit defendants' characterization of these interactions. But it might not, and the court cannot accept defendants' characterization of the allegations at the pleading stage. Instead, when one accepts the allegations as true and views them in the class plaintiffs' favor, one reasonably can infer that the PBMs' alleged conduct amounted to far more than a commercial negotiation. Instead, the Class Complaint alleges that the PBMs formed relationships with defendants sufficient to plead a plausible RICO enterprise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-216\">\n   <em>\n    And finally\n   </em>\n   , the Class Complaint alleges an enterprise with longevity sufficient to permit the associates to pursue the enterprise's purpose.

Instead, the class plaintiffs allege that Mylan and Pfizer entered into unlawful reverse payment settlements, but then-together-issued false press releases describing the settlements as a legitimate means to resolve patent litigation. One reasonably can infer the Class Complaint to allege that defendants advanced their scheme to inflate the price of the EpiPen by fraudulently representing to the public that they were resolving valid patent litigation. But the class plaintiffs allege that defendants, in reality, used the patent litigation and resulting \"pay-for-delay\" settlements as a means to prevent generic competition, to protect the EpiPen monopoly, and to continue raising prices on the EpiPen. Indeed, the Class Complaint alleges that the \"pay-for-delay\" settlements \"concealed from consumers the true, anti-competitive aims of its pay-for-delay arrangements.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 659.e.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-245\">\n   It is reasonable to infer from these allegations that defendants' communications fraudulently misled, deceived, and caused American consumers to purchase the EpiPen at an inflated price.

And, defendants contend, the class plaintiffs' competitive delay claims accrued more than four years before they filed their lawsuit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-265\">\n   Indeed, the Class Complaint alleges that defendants entered the unlawful \"pay-for-delay\" agreements in 2011 and 2012.

Rather, defendants engaged in new and additional acts each time they charged the allegedly inflated prices for the EpiPen.

Instead, the class plaintiffs explain, their state consumer protection law claims allege that Mylan engaged in unfair methods of competition, unfair or deceptive acts or practices, or unconscionable acts or practices that violated various state consumer protection laws. The class plaintiffs allege that these violations furthered defendants' scheme to charge inflated prices for the EpiPen.

The court agrees. The Class Complaint alleges that Mylan made several misrepresentations as part of defendants' scheme to monopolize the EAI market and charge consumers inflated prices for the EpiPen. These misrepresentations include: misinformation about Auvi-Q and its bioequivalence to the EpiPen (Class Complaint \u00b6\u00b6 229-31); misleading statements about EpiPen's status as the \"preferred brand\" and suggesting that Auvi-Q's exclusion from drug formularies was based on clinical recommendations and not Mylan's huge, conditional rebates (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 232-34); false representations about the medical necessity of the EpiPen 2-Pak (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 335-46); Ms. Bresch's false statement that Mylan had invested $1 billion in developing the EpiPen to create \"access and awareness and improv[e] the product\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 375); and falsely claiming that 80% of consumers with insurance pay nothing for EpiPen (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 403-04).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-303\">\n   The Mylan Defendants assert that these alleged misrepresentations cannot possibly support state law consumer protection claims because none amounted to material representations,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , these statements did not affect consumers' purchasing decisions because no reasonable person would attach importance to them. The court cannot reach this conclusion as a matter of law based on the allegations pleaded by the class plaintiffs. Indeed, as the class plaintiffs argue, in the context of reviewing orders issued by the Federal Trade Commission, courts have recognized the FTC's presumption of materiality for matters \"that significantly involve health, safety, or other areas with which the reasonable consumer would be concerned, including a claim that concerns the purpose, safety, efficacy, or\n   <em>\n    cost\n   </em>\n   of the product or service, its durability, performance, warranties or quality or a finding by another agency regarding the product.\"\n   <em>\n    Novartis Corp. v.

It is plausible to infer from the class plaintiffs' allegations that a consumer would find the alleged misrepresentations about the EpiPen's cost material to consumers. The same is true for the medical necessity of the 2-Pak and Auvi-Q's bioequivalence to the EpiPen. The court thus finds that the class plaintiffs' allegations sufficiently allege material misrepresentations to support the state consumer protection law claims and survive dismissal at the pleading stage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-304\">\n   Also, the Mylan Defendants assert that none of the alleged misrepresentations about the EpiPen price could have misled consumers about the actual price or the nature of the product. The court disagrees. The class plaintiffs direct the court to at least two alleged misrepresentations that-when viewed in the class plaintiffs' favor-permit a plausible inference that these statements were deceptive. First, the Class Complaint alleges that Mylan stated publicly on its website and in the media that \"80% of consumers with insurance pay nothing for the EpiPen.\" Class Compl. \u00b6 403. The Class Complaint alleges that this statement is a pernicious \"half-truth\" because, as one commentator has questioned, the EpiPen's retail price is over $600 and many Americans have high-deductible health plans that require making payments out of pocket before insurance coverage applies.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10514734\" index=\"522\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/970/311/#p322\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Also, the class plaintiffs contend, this statement ignores the costs that insurance companies incur to pay for the EpiPen which, in turn, produces increased premiums and higher co-pays.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 404. Construing the allegations in the class plaintiffs' favor, it is plausible to infer that this statement misled consumers about the EpiPen's true price.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-305\">\n   Next, the class plaintiffs assert that Ms. Bresch falsely stated during a\n   <em>\n    Forbes\n   </em>\n   Summit interview that \"Mylan has invested $1 billion in developing the EpiPen in creating access and awareness and improving the product.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 375 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). The Class Complaint alleges that this statement was false because Mylan did not spend $1 billion on actual product improvement but, instead, spent it on lobbying and paying its executives.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 385. Accepting these allegations as true-as the court must on a motion to dismiss-it is plausible to infer that these false statements misled consumers about the EpiPen and influenced their purchasing decisions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-306\">\n   The Mylan Defendants also contend that Mylan's statements about the medical\n   necessity of the EpiPen 2-Pak are not deceptive. For support, the Mylan Defendants have submitted a chart comparing statements from an August 2011 press release about the 2-Pak with NIAID and WAO guidelines. Doc. 95-9. In doing so, the Mylan Defendants ask the court to construe the medical guidelines and find that they support Mylan's statement in the press release that its decision to sell only the EpiPen 2-Pak \"aligns\" with medical guidelines.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3. The court cannot properly decide this factual dispute on a motion to dismiss. Also, the class plaintiffs assert that the press release is misleading because it omits material facts. These allegations suffice to allege that Mylan's statements about the EpiPen 2-Pak were deceptive or misleading.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-307\">\n   Finally, the Mylan Defendants argue that the alleged misleading statements about Auvi-Q cannot support the state consumer protection law claims. The Mylan Defendants contend that the statements could not have caused consumers to purchase EpiPen over Auvi-Q because the class plaintiffs never allege that Auvi-Q was a superior product or less expensive than EpiPen. The Mylan Defendants assert that the class plaintiffs could make no such allegations because, in October 2015, Sanofi recalled Auvi-Q from the market. As the class plaintiffs argue, however, the Mylan Defendants ignore the context of the alleged misrepresentations about Auvi-Q. The Class Complaint alleges that Mylan made the misrepresentations as part of defendants' scheme to restrain competition in the EAI market and, specifically, to block Auvi-Q from that market.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Class Compl. \u00b6 235. On a motion to dismiss, the court cannot determine-as a matter of law-whether Auvi-Q left the market because of manufacturing issues or, as the class plaintiffs assert, Mylan's conduct prevented it from gaining traction in the market. The court thus finds that the allegedly deceptive and misleading statements about Auvi-Q suffice to support the state consumer protection law claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-308\">\n   <em>\n    Second\n   </em>\n   , the Mylan Defendants argue that the class plaintiffs never allege any unfair practices that violate state consumer protection laws. Largely, the Mylan Defendants premise this argument on ones that defendants asserted earlier in their briefs. The Mylan Defendants contend that the Class Complaint fails to allege that Mylan engaged in any anticompetitive or fraudulent conduct capable of supporting a finding or inference that it engaged in unfair practices violating state consumer protection laws. But the court already has determined that the Class Complaint plausibly alleges that defendants-including Mylan-violated the antitrust and RICO laws by implementing a fraudulent scheme to monopolize the market and force consumers to pay inflated prices for EpiPen. As explained in the next paragraph, these allegations also suffice to assert plausibly that Mylan engaged in unfair practices violating state consumer protection laws.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-309\">\n   As both parties explain in their briefs, states apply different standards to determine what constitutes unfair or unconscionable conduct capable of violating state consumer protection laws. Some states employ the \"cigarette test,\" examining whether the alleged unfair practice: (1) offends established public policy; (2) is immoral, unethical, oppressive, unscrupulous; and (3) causes substantial injury to consumers.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Zito v.

Class Compl. \u00b6 1012. Construing their allegations in the class plaintiffs' favor, Mylan's alleged unfair conduct offended the public policy against anticompetitive and fraudulent conduct and the public policy favoring consumer protection.\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n   Second, the class plaintiffs allege that the conduct is \"immoral, unethical, oppressive, [and] unscrupulous....\"\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Votto v.

One reasonably can infer that Mylan's alleged conduct satisfies that definition under the test's second prong. Finally, the class plaintiffs allege that the unfair conduct substantially injured consumers.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"533\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=871%20A.2d%20981\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Taking the allegations as true, the Class Complaint alleges that Mylan's conduct substantially injured the class plaintiffs by forcing them to pay inflated prices for the EpiPen.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-312\">\n   The Class Complaint also plausibly alleges the elements of the second test-the \"substantial injury\" test. Namely, it asserts that: (1) the class plaintiffs allege that Mylan's unfair conduct substantially harmed consumers by requiring them to pay inflated prices for the EpiPen; (2) the class plaintiffs allege that they could not have avoided this injury because Mylan-through its unfair conduct-restrained competition, limited consumer choice, and prevented consumers from accessing competing products, and (3) the class plaintiffs identify no countervailing benefits to consumers or competition that could outweigh Mylan's unfair conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-313\">\n   In sum, the court concludes that the class plaintiffs' allegations plausibly allege unfair practices sufficient to support their state consumer protection law claims.\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-314\">\n   <em>\n    Third\n   </em>\n   , the Mylan Defendants assert that the state consumer protection law claims fail as a matter of law because the class plaintiffs never allege that they sustained an actual injury or ascertainable loss. The Mylan Defendants' arguments mirror the ones that they asserted to attack the class plaintiffs' standing. For the same reasons already explained, the court rejects the Mylan Defendants' arguments. The class plaintiffs have pleaded economic loss adequately to support state law consumer protection claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-315\">\n   <em>\n    Fourth\n   </em>\n   , the Mylan Defendants argue that the class plaintiffs have failed to plead reliance. But, when pleading their state consumer protection law claims, the Class Complaint explicitly alleges that the class plaintiffs relied on Mylan's misrepresentations and omissions about the EpiPen.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Class Complaint \u00b6\u00b6 716, 729, 748, 789, 806, 820, 835, 848, 863, 878, 893, 910, 925, 941, 956, 971, 986, 1001, 1018, 1036, 1050, 1063, 1076, 1101, 1115, 1127, 1141, 1155, 1168, 1183, 1196, 1211, 1225, 1239, 1253, 1267, 1281, 1296, 1312, 1328, 1343, 1357, 1372, 1386, 1401, 1416.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-316\">\n   The Mylan Defendants contend that the class plaintiffs' reliance allegations are just conclusory, and thus insufficient to support the state consumer protection law claims.

The Class Complaint satisfies that standard here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-323\">\n   It alleges several misrepresentations or omissions identifying the time, place, and contents of the alleged misrepresentations, as well as the identity of the party making them. For example, the Class Complaint alleges that Mylan CEO Heather Bresch gave false and misleading statements about EpiPen's profits and the reasons for raising the EpiPen's profits in her September 21, 2016, Congressional testimony, a January 27, 2017, interview with CBS News, a June 9, 2017, interview with the\n   <em>\n    Los Angeles Times\n   </em>\n   , and a December 1, 2016,\n   <em>\n    Forbes\n   </em>\n   Summit interview.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Class Complaint \u00b6\u00b6 194-95, 375, 417-48. It also alleges that Mylan made misleading statements in an August 24, 2011, press release\n   about its decision to sell the EpiPen exclusively as a 2-Pak.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 336-39. It also alleges that Mylan made misleading statements in its marketing materials distributed during 2014.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   232-34. According to the Class Complaint, the marketing materials included misleading statements, touting EpiPen as the \"preferred brand\" and suggesting that Auvi-Q's exclusion was based on clinical recommendations-not the large, conditional rebates that Mylan gave to formularies in exchange for offering EpiPen exclusively and excluding Auvi-Q.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-324\">\n   While it is true, the Class Complaint does not \"provide[ ] details about how and when\" the class plaintiffs learned about the misrepresentations, this is of no legal consequence at this stage.

As explained in the following subsection (\n    <em>\n     see infra\n    </em>\n    Part III.A.4.), the court concludes that plaintiffs have alleged a plausible conspiracy between Mylan and Pfizer that included their coordinated scheme to initiate patent litigation against potential competitors in the EAI market, and then, to settle those lawsuits by agreeing to pay those potential competitors to postpone entry into the market.

The court is not persuaded by this argument.

The Mylan Defendants have not moved the court to dismiss the class plaintiffs' claims for injunctive relief under the Colorado Consumer Protection Act for this reason.
