Trenga, United States District Judge\n   In this insurance coverage dispute, the parties have filed cross-motions for summary judgment. [Doc. Nos. 20 and 30]. The dispositive issue is whether the \"Pollution Exclusion\" in the insurance policy Zenith purchased from Allied applies to preclude the coverage that would otherwise apply. For the reasons stated below, the Court concludes that the Pollution exclusion does not apply. Accordingly, Defendant Zenith Aviation, Inc. is entitled to summary judgment in its favor as to this coverage issue.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The following facts are undisputed unless otherwise noted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Defendant Zenith Aviation, Inc. (\"Zenith\")\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   is an aircraft parts distributor. In spring 2017, Zenith hired Abby Construction Company to install an elevator at its warehouse located in Fredericksburg, Virginia. Abby \"used jack hammers to cut the pit for the elevator but they later found out that they were eight inches short.\" Zenith's Mem. in Supp. [Doc. No. 22] Statement of Undisputed Facts (\"Zenith SOF\") \u00b6 2. Abby \"then used a wet saw to cut away the additional eight inches of concrete, however they did not use any water with the wet saw.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 3. As a result, the saw generated a significant amount of concrete dust that billowed out of the warehouse prompting surrounding businesses to contact the fire department believing the dust to be smoke from a fire.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 4. The concrete dust particulate \"settled on everything inside the building including inventory, shelves, walls and ceilings[ ]\" and as a result, damaged Zenith's airplane parts inventory stored in the warehouse as well as its \"automated electronic retrieval system.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 5-6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff Allied Property and Casualty Company, Inc.

ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Allied acknowledges that Zenith has suffered a \"direct physical loss\" that would be covered but for the application of the Pollution Exclusion.

Because no Virginia court has definitively ruled on the scope and application of the Pollution Exclusion, or a close approximation, under facts comparable to those presented here, the Court must predict how the Supreme Court of Virginia would decide the issue, were presented to it. In making that determination, the Court must interpret and apply the language of the Policy according to settled principles of Virginia law regarding the interpretation of insurance policies.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Seals v.

Zenith's alleged losses, by its own description, resulted from the concrete dust's deleterious effect on its inventory and machinery. For these reasons, the concrete dust meets the definition of a \"pollutant\" and therefore is within the operation of the Pollution Exclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The Pollution Exclusion removes from coverage any \"loss or damage caused by or resulting from [the] ... dispersal ...

Here, the \"pollutant\" is the concrete dust. Zenith contends that the Pollution Exclusion does not apply because of the causative role played by \"smoke,\" a \"specified cause of loss.\" The issue then is whether (1) the dispersal or migration of the concrete dust was itself caused by \"smoke;\" or (2) whether the dispersal or migration of the concrete dust resulted in \"smoke\" and \"smoke\" caused Zenith's loss.

Quoting\n   <em>\n    Andrew Robinson Int'l\n   </em>\n   , Zenith proposes that \" 'smoke' may mean '[a] cloud of fine particulate matter,' and 'dust' may mean '[f]ine, dry particles of matter' or '[a] cloud of dust.' Thus, under certain circumstances, dust and smoke are interchangeable.\" Zenith's Mem. in Supp. 11 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Andrew Robinson Int'l\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2006%20WL%201537382\">\n    2006 WL 1537382\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *9 ). In substance, Zenith contends that \"smoke\" includes any visible suspension of solid particles in a gaseous medium, whether they are the results of combustion or simply dust that has been agitated into the air. In advancing that position, it essentially contends that \"smoke\" is at least ambiguous as to the scope of its definition and under Virginia law that ambiguity must be resolved in favor of coverage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Allied, on the other hand, contends that the word \"smoke\" is not ambiguous and necessarily means within the context of the Policy the \"visible products of combustion,\" relying,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , on\n   <em>\n    K &amp; Lee Corp. v. Scottsdale Ins. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5879187\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/769/870/\">\n    769 F.Supp. 870\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (E.D. Pa. 1991). The court in\n   <em>\n    K &amp; Lee Corp.\n   </em>\n   concluded that \"smoke\" commonly refers to the products of combustion, but more consistently refers to some\n   <em>\n    visible\n   </em>\n   phenomenon.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5879187\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/769/870/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5879187\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/769/870/\">\n    at 874\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"While smoke may result from some chemical reactions, the common usage of the term refers to the products of combustion and, more importantly, to matter that is visible.\"). Because the vapor at issue in that case was invisible, the\n   <em>\n    K &amp; Lee\n   </em>\n   court did not have to consider, and did not conclude, that \"smoke\" referred only to the products of combustion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   In substance, dictionaries define \"smoke\" as the visible phenomenon of particulate suspended in a gas, typically, but not exclusively, as the products of combustion suspended in the hot gasses from a fire or other pyrolysis. In short, definitions of \"smoke\" include \"the gaseous products of burning materials\" and the more general \"suspension of particles in a gas.\"\n   <em>\n    See e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Smoke Definition\n   </em>\n   , Merriam-Webster.com, https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/smoke (last visited August 27, 2018) (defining \"smoke\" as \"the gaseous products of burning materials\" or \"a suspension of particles in a gas\"). Allied points to the more limited definition; Zenith, the more general. The issue, then, is whether \"smoke\" as used in the Pollution Exclusion is limited to smoke caused by \"the gaseous products of burning materials,\" or more generally to all visible \"suspensions of particles in a gas.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5879187\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/769/870/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Allied argues that, while dictionaries are useful in interpreting contract language, \"courts generally have recognized that it is inappropriate to interpret an insurance policy by inserting any conceivable dictionary definition of the term at issue.\" Allied's Mem. in Supp. 17 (citing\n   <em>\n    United States Fid. &amp; Guaranty Co. v. First State Bank &amp; Trust co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"910532\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/125/680/\">\n    125 F.3d 680\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (8th Cir. 1997) ). But Allied offers nothing from the context or structure of the Policy that counsels in favor of the more narrow definition of \"smoke\" it proposes, but simply relies on what it contends is its more common usage.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Allied's Mem. in Supp. 18-19 (\"By contrast, the presence of dust in the air is not normally associated with combustion, and instead, can merely mimic smoke in appearance, ....\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The applicable definition of \"smoke\" as used in the Pollution Exclusion is unclear, with more than one reasonable definition. The text and structure of the Policy (including\n   the other \"specified causes of loss\") are insufficient to conclude that the parties intended to adopt the more narrow definition of \"smoke\" for the purposes of the Pollution Exclusion. Well-settled principles of Virginia insurance law therefore require the Court to adopt the interpretation favoring coverage; \"smoke\" as used in the Policy refers to any visible suspension of particles in a gas, including the concrete dust suspended in ambient air in Zenith's warehouse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Allied next contends that even if the concrete dust constitutes \"smoke,\" it does not fall into either of the exceptions to the Pollution Exclusion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Allied Mem. in Supp. 12-13 (\"the 'discharge, dispersal, seepage, migration, release or escape' of the pollutant, regardless of whether the concrete dust is considered an 'irritant or contaminant' or 'smoke,' and the 'specified cause of loss' cannot be one and the same. Instead, the discharge ... must 'result in' a specified cause of loss.\"). In short, Allied argues that the concrete dust in the air, even if it were considered \"smoke,\" does not \"cause\" a loss when it merely settles on to sensitive airplane parts, contaminating them, because the concrete particulate in the air does not \"result in\" the dust on the inventory and machinery since it is the dust.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The exceptions to the Pollution Exclusion require, as Allied contends, a causal nexus between a specified cause of loss and the pollutant. As reflected in the stated facts, (1) Abby Construction used a wet saw without water to cut concrete; (2) that saw \"released\" or \"dispersed\" concrete particulate solids into the air; (3) that dust, rather than falling immediately to the ground, \"billowed\" into a cloud of particulate, resulting in \"smoke\"; and (4) the particulate from that cloud of smoke ultimately settled on Zenith's products and equipment, contaminating them and causing the loss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Applying the plain text of the exceptions to the Pollution Exclusion, both exceptions apply. As required by the first exception, Zenith's loss resulted from the dispersal or migration of a pollutant (i.e., the concrete particulate) onto its inventory and machinery and that dispersal or migration was caused by a visible gaseous suspension of the concrete particulate in the air, i.e., smoke. The \"dispersal\" or \"migration\" of the concrete dust onto Zenith's products was therefore \"itself caused by\" the smoke from which it settled, and therefore the loss falls under the first exception to the pollution exclusion. As required by the second exception, the \"discharge, dispersal, seepage, migration, release or escape\" of the concrete particulate dust from the wet saw \"result[ed] in\" smoke, a specified cause of loss, which then caused Zenith's loss.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Allied's argument that \"smoke\" cannot simultaneously be both the \"pollutant\" and the \"specified cause of loss\" (\"smoke cannot 'result in' smoke\") mischaracterizes the required analysis. The pollutant is the concrete particulate; the specified cause of loss is the visible suspension of that particulate in a gas, i.e., smoke. Under the Pollution Exclusion, the \"pollutant\" and \"the specified cause of loss\" are distinct elements of a causal chain relative to the claimed loss. But given the Policy's definitions\n   of each of those elements, the Pollution Exclusion does not preclude the concrete dust (the \"pollutant\") from being a constituent part of the smoke (the \"specified cause of loss\"). A \"pollutant\" is a substance that constitutes an \"irritant or a contaminant.\" A \"specified cause of loss\" is an instrumentality of loss. The fact that the particles that contaminated Zenith's products and equipment were the same as the particles that were a constituent part of the \"smoke\" does not mean that there is no causal separation between the \"pollutant\" that was dispersed and the \"specified cause of the loss\" that dispersed it or resulted from it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   For the above reasons, the Court concludes that the Supreme Court of Virginia would conclude that the Pollution Exclusion does not apply and there is coverage under the Policy for Zenith's alleged losses. Zenith is therefore entitled to a declaration of coverage and summary judgment in its favor on as to the parties' respective requests for a declaratory judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.
