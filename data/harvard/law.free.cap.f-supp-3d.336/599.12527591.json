Likelihood of Success on the Merits\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Plaintiff contends that it is likely to prevail on its underlying procedural due process claim because Defendants have failed to provide Plaintiff with an ALJ hearing during the time period mandated by statute. Courts look at three factors when determining whether a procedural due process violation has occurred: \"First, the private interest that will be affected by the official action; second, the risk of an erroneous deprivation of such interest through the procedures used, and the probable value, if any, of additional or substitute procedural safeguards; and finally, the Government's interest, including the function involved and the fiscal and administrative burdens that the additional or substitute procedural requirement would entail.\"\n   <em>\n    Mathews v. Eldridge\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12026449\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/424/319/#p335\">\n    424 U.S. 319\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 335,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12026449\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/424/319/#p335\">\n    96 S.Ct. 893\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12026449\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/424/319/#p335\">\n    47 L.Ed.2d 18\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1976).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   As to the first factor, the private interest that is affected is Plaintiff's very existence and financial stability. Plaintiff certainly has a property interest in the Medicare payments for services rendered to patients. Second, the risk of the erroneous deprivation of this private interest absent an ALJ hearing is great. Plaintiff offers evidence that the \"Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General found that claim denials associated with these alleged overpayments are overturned wholly or partially at the ALJ level 60% of the time.\" ECF No. 16 at 5. Although Plaintiff can escalate its appeal to the DAB, it would be deprived of important procedural safeguards inherent to the ALJ hearing, namely to test the validity of Defendants' statistical sample in an evidentiary hearing before an independent arbiter. Finally, Plaintiff is not seeking any additional or substitute safeguards that would lead to administrative or financial burdens on the Government. For example, Plaintiff is not asking the Court to order Defendants to provide it with an ALJ hearing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff is simply asking that the Government not deprive it of money that it has earned when the Government cannot comply with its own procedural requirements in a timely manner. Accordingly, the Court concludes that Plaintiff has shown a substantial likelihood of success on the merits of its procedural due process claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Irreparable Harm\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Plaintiff has complied with the administrative appeals process and has been waiting more than two years for a hearing before an ALJ. During that time, Plaintiff has lost an estimated $6,000,000 in gross revenue, and its owner, Dr. Steven McKay, has contributed more than $1,300,000 in capital contributions in order to keep the business operational. ECF No. 5-2 at 4. Additionally, Plaintiff has been forced to terminate twenty four employees in light of its dwindling gross revenue.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff's\n   share of the applicable healthcare market has \"shrunk precipitously.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3. Plaintiff's Chief Financial Officer attested that, \"[i]f such recoupment continues, it will irreparably harm [Plaintiff], and [it] will be forced to close [its] doors and declare bankruptcy imminently.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4. Accordingly, the Court concludes that Plaintiff has established a substantial threat of immediate and irreparable harm for which no adequate remedy at law exists.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Balance of the Equities\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The balance of the equities weighs in favor of granting the TRO. Absent relief, Plaintiff alleges that it will go bankrupt, employees will lose their jobs, and patients will lose access to much needed healthcare. Conversely, Defendants will suffer no harm from granting the TRO because they will have the ability to resume recoupment of any overpayments if the ALJ rules in their favor. Under the facts of this case, the Court finds that the harm to Defendants is substantially outweighed by the harm that Plaintiff will suffer if recoupment continues while it is deprived of a hearing before an ALJ.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Public Interest\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The quality of the healthcare services Plaintiff provides to an underserved community is not at issue in this case, only the reimbursement for those services. The public interest will be served by granting the TRO in order to allow Plaintiff to continue to provide these much needed services.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    V. Bond Requirement\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   In its discretion, the Court waives the bond requirement for Plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pashby v. Delia\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3547850\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/709/307/#p332\">\n    709 F.3d 307\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 332 (4th Cir. 2013) (\"[T]he district court retains the discretion to set the bond amount as it sees fit or waive the security requirement.\" (citations omitted) ). Under the circumstances of this case, the Court finds that the Defendants will suffer no meaningful harm, as they can continue their ongoing recoupment efforts immediately if this Order is dissolved.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hoechst Diafoil Co. v. Nan Ya Plastics Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11620515\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/174/411/\">\n    174 F.3d 411\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 421 n.3 (4th Cir. 1999) (\"In fixing the amount of an injunction bond, the district court should be guided by the purpose underlying Rule 65(c), which is to provide a mechanism for reimbursing an enjoined party for harm it suffers as a result of an improvidently issued injunction or restraining order.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   For the reasons detailed above, the Court\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS\n   </strong>\n   Plaintiff's Motion for Temporary Restraining Order, ECF No. 5, and\n   <strong>\n    ORDERS\n   </strong>\n   that Defendants are hereby restrained and enjoined from withholding Medicare payments to Plaintiff to effectuate the recoupment of any alleged overpayments. The Court\n   <strong>\n    FURTHER ORDERS\n   </strong>\n   that Defendants are hereby restrained and enjoined from attempting or initiating any other collection efforts, such as referral through the Department of the Treasure or a third-party collection agency. This TRO shall expire fourteen days after the date and hour of its issuance, unless otherwise extended by the Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The Court directs Defendants to file a response to Plaintiff's Motion for Preliminary Injunction by Monday, August 27, 2018, and Defendant shall file a reply, if necessary, by Wednesday, August 29, 2018. A hearing on the Motion for Preliminary Injunction will be held on Friday, August 31, 2018, at 1:00 p.m., at the Donald S. Russell Courthouse, 201 Magnolia Street, Spartanburg, South Carolina 29306.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The Court encourages the parties to seek a beneficial resolution of the underlying Medicare appeals. Therefore, the parties may notify the Court by Wednesday,\n   August 29, 2018, if they consent to an extension of the TRO so that settlement negotiations may continue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   IT IS SO ORDERED.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-48\">\n    CGS, Inc. is the MAC for DME claims in South Carolina.
