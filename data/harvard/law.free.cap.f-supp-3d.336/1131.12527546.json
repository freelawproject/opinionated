SPERO, Chief Magistrate Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    I. INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In this case, Plaintiffs Desert Survivors, Center for Biological Diversity, WildEarth Guardians, and Western Watersheds Project challenged: 1) the decision of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to withdraw the proposed listing of the Bi-State Sage-Grouse as \"threatened\" under the Endangered Species Act (the \"Withdrawal Decision\");\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   and 2) the Service's \"Final Policy on Interpretation of the Phrase 'Significant Portion of its Range' in the Endangered Species Act\" (the \"SPR Policy\"). On May 15, 2018, the Court issued an order granting Plaintiffs' summary judgment motion and denying Defendants' summary judgment motions. In response to the Court's request, the parties have provided briefing on the appropriate remedy in light of the Court's rulings. The Court's ruling on remedies is set forth below.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    II. WITHDRAWAL DECISION REMEDY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Judicial review of agency action under the Endangered Species Act is governed by the \"arbitrary or capricious\" standard set forth in the Administrative Procedures Act (\"APA\"), which provides that \"a reviewing court shall ... hold unlawful and set aside agency action, findings, and conclusions found to be ... arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20706\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2)(A). In its summary judgment order, the Court concluded that the Service's Withdrawal Decision was arbitrary and capricious under the APA and unsupported by the record. Therefore, as the parties have agreed, the appropriate remedy is to vacate the Withdrawal Decision and remand with directions to the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (\"FWS\") to issue a new final listing decision. The parties also agree that the proposed rule to list the Bi-State DPS that was the subject of the Withdrawal Decision should be reinstated.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Paulsen v. Daniels\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8972162\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/413/999/#p1008\">\n    413 F.3d 999\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1008 (9th Cir. 2005) (\"The effect of invalidating an agency rule is to reinstate the rule previously in force.\"). Finally, the parties have agreed on certain requirements regarding the timing of the actions required of FWS upon remand, which the Court finds to be reasonable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Therefore, with respect to the Withdrawal Decision, the Court ORDERS as follows:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   1) The Withdrawal of the Proposed Rule to List the Bi-State Distinct Population Segment of Greater Sage-Grouse and Designate Critical Habitat (\"Withdrawal Decision\"), published at\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=80%20Fed.%20Reg.%2022%2C828\">\n    80 Fed.

SPR POLICY REMEDY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In its summary judgment order, the Court concluded that the definition of \"significant\" in the SPR Policy is an impermissible interpretation of the \"significant\n   portion of its range\" language in the Endangered Species Act. The parties agree that some sort of vacatur of the SPR Policy is an appropriate remedy, and both sides agree that any vacatur of the SPR Policy should be limited to the definition of \"significant\" that the Court found to be impermissible. Defendants, however, contend the Court should limit the vacatur order to the particular geographical region in which Plaintiffs' injury occurred, namely, the District of Nevada and the Eastern District of California, where the Bi-State DPS is found. Plaintiffs contend there should be no such limitation. The Court concludes that Plaintiffs are correct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   As a preliminary matter, the Court notes that in \"rare circumstances,\" an invalid rule may be left in place without vacatur on the basis of equity concerns.\n   <em>\n    Ctr. for Envtl.

Cir. 1993) ). Defendants do not invoke this exception, however, in support of their request for a geographical limitation on the Court's vacatur order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Instead, Defendants point to the Ninth Circuit's admonition in\n   <em>\n    Los Angeles Havens Hospice, Inc. v.

According to Defendants, because the injury Plaintiffs suffered occurred only in the Bi-State DPS, a remedy that extends only to that geographical region is all that is needed or appropriate to afford sufficient relief. They further assert that under\n   <em>\n    Los Angeles Havens Hospice\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    ,\n   </em>\n   a geographically limited vacatur order is preferable to nationwide vacatur because other courts will have the opportunity to address a difficult issue in different factual contexts, resulting in multiple decisions by various courts of appeals.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4199641\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/638/644/#p664\">\n    638 F.3d at 664\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Defendants also suggest that a geographical limitation is required under\n   <em>\n    Lujan v.

They point out that in\n   <em>\n    Center for Biological Diversity v. Jewell\n   </em>\n   (\"\n   <em>\n    CBD I\n   </em>\n   \"), Case No. 14-2506 (District of Arizona), Judge Marquez amended her order vacating the SPR Policy on the basis that the plaintiffs in that case had established Article III standing only \"with respect to the Final Pygmy Owl Finding and the Final SPR Policy as applied in the District of Arizona\" and not \"to challenge the Final SPR Policy nationwide.\" Case No. 14-2506, Docket No. 81 (citing\n   <em>\n    Lujan v. Nat'l Wildlife Fed'n\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6220451\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/497/871/#p873\">\n    497 U.S. 871\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 891,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6220451\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/497/871/#p873\">\n    110 S.Ct. 3177\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6220451\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/497/871/#p873\">\n    111 L.Ed.2d 695\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1990) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The Court is not persuaded that an order partially vacating the SPR Policy-without a geographic limitation-violates the principle set forth in\n   <em>\n    Los Angeles Havens Hospice\n   </em>\n   or the rules that govern Article III standing. First, the remedy requested by the plaintiffs in\n   <em>\n    Los Angeles Havens Hospice\n   </em>\n   went beyond asking the\n   court to vacate the challenged regulation. In that case, a hospice provider brought a facial challenge to a regulation imposing an aggregate cap on Medicare payments to hospice providers.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4199641\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/638/644/#p664\">\n    638 F.3d at 665\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court found that the hospice provider, which had received an overpayment demand from the Department of Health and Human Services that was based on the hospice cap regulation, had standing to challenge the regulation, both on its face and as applied.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4199641\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/638/644/#p664\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4199641\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/638/644/#p664\">\n    at 653\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . It further found that the regulation was inconsistent with the applicable hospice cap statute under which it was promulgated.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4199641\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/638/644/#p664\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The judgment entered by the district court did \"not only invalidate[ ] the 2006 overpayment demand and the hospice cap regulation,\" however.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4199641\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/638/644/#p664\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   It \"also stated that 'HHS is hereby enjoined prospectively from using the current [version of]\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20418.309\">\n    42 C.F.R. \u00a7 418.309\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1) to calculate hospice cap liability for\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   hospice.' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20418.309\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis in original). It was this injunctive relief that the court found to be unduly burdensome, concluding that the district court abused its discretion but stopping short of finding that the nationwide injunction was \"in excess of its jurisdiction.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20418.309\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20418.309\">\n    at 661\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In reaching this conclusion, the Court of Appeals relied on the district court's own finding that \"a nationwide injunction would not be in the public interest because it would significantly disrupt the administration of the Medicare program by inhibiting HHS from enforcing the statutorily mandated hospice cap as to over 3,000 hospice providers, and would create great uncertainty for the government, Medicare contractors, and the hospice providers.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20418.309\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In contrast to\n   <em>\n    Los Angeles Havens Hospice\n   </em>\n   , Plaintiffs here have not asked for a nationwide injunction. Nor have Defendants pointed to evidence that an order vacating one aspect of the SPR Policy will lead to the sort of disruption that was likely to result from a nationwide injunction in\n   <em>\n    Los Angeles Havens Hospice\n   </em>\n   . Indeed, it is not clear that the geographical limitation proposed by Defendants would not itself be a source of confusion given that Plaintiffs have identified a number of species whose habitats include the Eastern District of California and/or the District of Nevada and also other districts where the definition of \"significant\" under the SPR Policy would remain in effect under Defendants' proposal. Moreover, nothing in\n   <em>\n    Los Angeles Havens Hospice\n   </em>\n   suggests that the court would have abused its discretion if it had merely vacated the challenged regulation, as Plaintiffs request here. To the contrary, the court in that case made clear that \"[a]n order declaring the hospice cap regulation invalid, enjoining further enforcement against Haven Hospice, and requiring the Secretary to recalculate its liability in conformity with the hospice cap statute, would have afforded the plaintiff complete relief.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20418.309\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Further, the Court is not persuaded that the possible benefit of multiple decisions by courts of appeals addressing different fact patterns justifies limiting the scope of the vacatur geographically. The Court found that the SPR Policy is deficient as a\n   <em>\n    matter of law\n   </em>\n   , meaning that it cannot be reconciled with any set of facts. Further, to the extent that the Court has found that the definition of \"significant\" is inconsistent with the Endangered Species Act, any possible benefit that might arise from multiple decisions addressing the lawfulness of the policy is outweighed by the fact that application of the policy could prevent species from being afforded the protection the ESA was intended by Congress to afford them.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nw.

Although the court in\n    <em>\n     CBD I\n    </em>\n    cited\n    <em>\n     Lujan\n    </em>\n    for the proposition that a regulation is not ripe for review under the APA until there has been some concrete action applying to the claimant's situation, the court did not explain how that language supported the conclusion that the plaintiffs in that case-who\n    <em>\n     had\n    </em>\n    been subject to concrete agency action and were bringing a facial challenge to the SPR Policy based on the harm that they suffered from that concrete action-lacked standing to seek vacatur beyond the geographical area where they suffered injury. As discussed above,\n    <em>\n     Lujan\n    </em>\n    recognizes that a successful facial challenge to a regulation may result in its invalidation even if that remedy affects nonparties. The Court finds nothing in\n    <em>\n     Lujan\n    </em>\n    that suggests that a party who brings a facial challenge based on a concrete injury has standing only as to the geographical area where the injury occurred. The only other case Defendants cite in which vacatur was geographically limited is\n    <em>\n     Cape Hatteras Access Pres. All. v.

In that case, however, the court limited the scope of the vacatur simply because the parties had agreed to do so and did not discuss any of the issues raised by the parties here as to the scope of the vacatur.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
