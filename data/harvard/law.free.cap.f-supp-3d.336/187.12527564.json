BATTS, United States District Judge.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   On July 20, 2017, Plaintiff Ashlynn Alexander filed a Complaint against Defendants Possible Productions Inc. (\"Possible\"), Showtime Pictures Development Company (\"Showtime\"), and Travis Rehwaldt, asserting claims for sex discrimination under the New York City Human Rights Law (\"NYCHRL\") (Count 3) and for retaliation under Title VII (Count 1), the New York State Human Rights Law (\"NYSHRL\") (Count 2), and NYCHRL (Count 4), stemming from her work as a body double on the television show\n   <em>\n    The Affair\n   </em>\n   . Defendants filed the instant Motion to compel the arbitration of Plaintiff's claims or, in the alternative, to dismiss them. For the following reasons, the Court DENIES Defendants' Motion to Compel Arbitration and DENIES their Motion to Dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I. BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   A. Allegations Relevant to Employment Discrimination\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff alleges that she was employed by Showtime and Possible from October 2013 to September 2015 as a body double for the character of Alison on the television show\n   <em>\n    The Affair\n   </em>\n   . (Compl. \u00b6 36.) Rehwaldt was an assistant director on the show and was allegedly Plaintiff's supervisor. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 37-38.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   At the end of filming each day, all cast and crew members received a call sheet, created by Rehwaldt, which listed each person's role and a detailed schedule for the next day's work. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 39-40.) Generally, the call sheets listed Plaintiff's role as \"Alison Body Double.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 42.) Plaintiff alleges that on September 17, 2015, she received a call sheet (the \"Call Sheet\") from Rehwaldt describing her role as, \"Alison Sexytime Double.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 44-45.) Defendants have attached the purported Call Sheet to their Motion to Dismiss. (Declaration of Mary Eaton (\"Eaton Decl.\") Ex. F.) That document lists Plaintiff's name under a column entitled cast with her character listed as \"Alison Double\" in the column next to her name. Lower down on the\n   same sheet in a section entitled \"Instructions,\" the Call Sheet says: \"\n   <em>\n    MAKEUP/HAIR:\n   </em>\n   Alison sexy time Double. Sc. B: Noah's Jacket.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiff alleges that she felt humiliated after receiving the Call Sheet because she thought it reduced her to a sexual object. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 45-47.) The day after she received the Call Sheet, she met with Rehwaldt to complain of what she felt was sexual harassment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 48.) Plaintiff told him that he had sexually harassed her, that his actions humiliated her in front of her coworkers, and that she was concerned she would not be paid properly for her work the day before. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 49.) Rehwaldt allegedly admitted that the language he used on the Call Sheet was inappropriate but also told her that she could be replaced easily. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 50.) Plaintiff did not complain further because she was allegedly afraid that she would lose her job. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 52.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On September 24, 2015, Plaintiff allegedly \"received notice that she was no longer needed\" on set for\n   <em>\n    The Affair\n   </em>\n   . (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 53.) When she asked for an explanation, she was allegedly told that she did not have a good hair match with the actress playing Ashley and that the show was looking for someone else to fill her role. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 54.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff thought that this explanation was untrue because she had been wearing a wig for the duration of her work in the role without issue and because the actress hired to replace her in the role also allegedly wears a wig. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 55-56.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   B. Relevant Contractual Provisions\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Showtime allegedly hired Plaintiff pursuant to a Performer's Freelance Television Contract (the \"Contract\"). (Eaton Decl. Ex. A.) The Contract incorporates certain provisions of the Screen Actors Guild Television Agreement (Eaton Decl. Ex. B (the \"CBA\") ). The Contract contains an Arbitration Clause which states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   Should any dispute or controversy arise between the parties hereto with reference to this contract, or the employment herein provided for, such dispute or controversy shall be settled and determined by conciliation and arbitration in accordance with and to the extent provided in the conciliation and arbitration provisions of the [CBA], and such provisions are hereby referred to and by such reference incorporated herein an made a part of this agreement with the same effect as though the same were set forth herein in detail.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   (Contract \u00b6 13.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Section 50 of the CBA is entitled \"Arbitration.\" (CBA \u00a7 50.) It states: \"Disputes involving or relating to the right of termination of a performer's individual employment contract are not arbitrable, except ... with respect to ... body doubles.\" (CBA \u00a7 50(b).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The CBA also sets forward a \"Policy of Non-Discrimination and Diversity.\" (CBA \u00a7 59.) It indicates:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   The parties hereto reaffirm their commitment to: a) a policy of non-discrimination an fair employment in connection with the engagement and treatment of performers on the basis of sex, race, color, creed, national origin, age, marital status, disability or sexual orientation, in accordance with applicable state and federal law; and b) to continue the active promotion of diversity, as set forth herein, in all categories of employment covered by this Agreement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   (CBA \u00a7 59(a)(1).) The section also contains an arbitration provision, stating that with one exception not applicable in this case, \"the matters covered in this Section are\n   not subject to the provisions of Section 50 herein.\" (CBA \u00a7 59(d).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   II.

The Court begins with the Contract's arbitration clause (Contract \u00b6 13), which appears to contain a broad statement in favor of arbitration. However, the clause incorporates the CBA's arbitration provisions. The CBA too appears to favor arbitration because it states that disputes involving the termination of employment contracts of body doubles (like Plaintiff) are arbitrable. (CBA \u00a7 50(b).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The non-discrimination provisions of the CBA, however, clearly exempt discrimination claims from the CBA's arbitration provisions. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   CBA \u00a7 59(d) (\"the matters in this Section are not subject to the provisions of Section 50\").) Thus, Plaintiff cannot be compelled to arbitrate her discrimination claims. There is not a \"clear and unmistakable\" statement that discrimination claims must be arbitrated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Defendants attempt to argue that Section 59, the non-discrimination provisions, do not cover an individual employee's rights with respect to violation of employment laws. In making this argument,\n   they confuse the applicable legal standard. Even without the exemption contained in Section 59, Plaintiff could not be compelled to arbitrate her claims. The arbitration clause in Section 50 is broad, saying, in effect, disputes involving body doubles are arbitrable. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   CBA \u00a7 50(b).) However, to compel arbitration of discrimination disputes under a CBA, an arbitration clause must specifically name anti-discrimination statutes.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wright\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11076333\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/525/70/#p80\">\n    525 U.S. at 80\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11076333\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/525/70/#p80\">\n    119 S.Ct. 391\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Cox v.

The plausibility standard is not akin to a \"probability requirement,\" but it asks for more than a sheer possibility that a defendant has acted unlawfully.
