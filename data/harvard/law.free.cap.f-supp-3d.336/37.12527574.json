Thus, the decision to suspend a proceeding does not necessarily mean that an outside litigation will alter the outcome of the TTAB proceeding. Determining whether the outcome of this litigation will affect the outcome of the OTIW's cancellation proceeding requires examining the allegations in the amended cancellation petition with respect to the claims in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Looking at the grounds for cancellation asserted in the OTIW's amended consolidated petition, the Court finds that the issues before the Court in this case are not material to the OTIW's grounds for cancellation. The OTIW's first set of challenges to Plaintiff's registrations are based on conduct entirely unrelated to the OTIW's rights to Plaintiff's name. The allegations that Plaintiff failed to utilize the registered marks have no connection to the OTIW's rights to the \"Oneida\" name.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Dkt. No. 23-2 at \u00b6\u00b6 191-93 (alleging Plaintiff had no bona fide intent to use the \"Oneida\" mark); \u00b6\u00b6 207-08 (alleging Plaintiff abandoned the \"Oneida\" mark); \u00b6\u00b6 211-13 (alleging Plaintiff never used the \"Oneida\" mark). Since these arguments for cancellation are unrelated to the OTIW's rights to \"Oneida Nation,\" the Court concludes that the outcome of this case will not materially effect their resolution in the TTAB proceeding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The outcome of this case will also not affect the OTIW's second group of arguments for cancellation, that the OTIW had preexisting marks that resembled Plaintiff's in 2006. These claims are based on filings from 2006, nearly a decade before the actions currently at issue.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 23-2 at \u00b6\u00b6 187-88, 214-15. Because the Department's challenged actions occurred in 2015-16, the outcome of this case is not pertinent to showing whether the OTIW had any marks that resembled Plaintiff's marks in 2006.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Finally, the outcome of this case will not help the OTIW establish that Plaintiff knowingly filed fraudulent statements regarding the OTIW's use of \"Oneida\" to the Trademark Board. The material issue in resolving these trademark fraud claims will be determining whether Plaintiff made a \"false statement with the intent to deceive the [United States Patent and Trademark Office] into issuing or maintaining that registration.\" Dkt.

Even if Plaintiff was aware of the proceedings, the actual approval itself is not material in determining fraud, as the central question is whether Plaintiff was aware of the OTIW's use of \"Oneida,\" not whether that use was sanctioned by the Department.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Similarly, whether the Department correctly recognized the OTIW as \"Oneida Nation\" when it published its list of federally recognized tribal entities is also irrelevant to adjudicating the fraud claims. The last allegedly fraudulent filing occurred on August 10, 2015, several months before the Department published the list in the Federal Register. Because these filings occurred well before the Department listed the OTIW as \"Oneida Nation\" in the list of federally recognized tribal entities, the publication is not relevant for determining\n   whether Plaintiff filed fraudulent documents in order to protect its trademarks.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Having reviewed the OTIW's cancellation petition before the TTAB, the Court concludes that even if the Court were to reverse the Department's decisions, this reversal would not alter the outcome of the TTAB proceeding. Thus, it is clear that even if the ongoing trademark action is an injury in fact, it is not redressable by this action and cannot be used to establish standing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     2. Confusion\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Plaintiff also argues that the Department's decision to approve the name change and listing the new name in the Federal Register has caused or will cause confusion between the two entities. Included in the Complaint is an allegation that the OTIW named a golf tournament the \"Oneida LPGA Classic.\" Plaintiff also points to its recent submission as proof that actual confusion has occurred between Plaintiff and the OTIW. The Court, however, disagrees that this injury establishes standing because Plaintiff has failed to show that any alleged potential or actual confusion is directly or indirectly traceable to the Department's actions and that the actual confusion alleged in Plaintiff's supplemental submission are neither injuries in fact nor traceable to the Department's actions at issue in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   In order to satisfy the traceability requirement, the alleged injury in fact must be \"fairly traceable to the actions of the defendant.\"\n   <em>\n    Bennett v.

The Department's approval of the OTIW's constitutional amendment to change its name would not, on its own, cause any confusion given that the action only amounted to approving a change to an internal tribal governance document. Further, the publication of the OTIW as \"Oneida Nation\" as a federally recognized tribal entity could not cause any confusion between Plaintiff and the OTIW because the Department notes that \"Oneida Nation\" was previously listed as the \"Oneida Tribe of Indians of Wisconsin\" on the list of federally recognized tribal entities in the Federal Register.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=83%20Fed.%20Reg.%2034863\">\n    83 Fed.

First, \"not all confusion counts: evidence of actual confusion must show more than a fleeting mix-up of names.\"\n   <em>\n    Streamline Production Systems, Inc. v. Streamline Manufacturing, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12277383\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/851/440/#p457\">\n    851 F.3d 440\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 457 (5th Cir. 2017). \"[S]ecretarial carelessness caused by a failure to check business addresses\" are not the sorts of confusion that the law recognizes as an injury.\n   <em>\n    U.S. Blind Stitch Mach.

Supp. 468\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 471 (S.D.N.Y. 1968). The two examples submitted by Plaintiff appear to be little more than \"secretarial confusion.\" In both cases, the third party knew which tribal entity it was supposed to be communicating with, as they both had preexisting relationships with the OTIW. Although for some reason, these two communiques were accidentally sent to Plaintiff, these mistakes are of the sort that could be quickly and easily remedied. As such, these two examples provided by Plaintiff are not the sort of confusion that would rise to a sufficient injury in fact necessary to establish standing in the first place.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Spokeo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12596653\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/1540/#p1547\">\n    136 S.Ct. at 1548\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting an injury \"must be 'de facto'; that is, it must actually exist\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   However, even if these examples were injuries in fact, they are not traceable to the Department's actions that are currently at issue. Purpora Engineering's misaddressed invoice identified the correct recipient, the OTIW, and used the correct physical address. The only mistake appears to be that Purpora Engineering somehow found and used Plaintiff's email address instead of the OTIW's. Given that neither challenged action involved the publication of Plaintiff or the OTIW's contact information, the Court does not see how this error could be traced back to the matters currently before the Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Similarly, the Court cannot see how the Department's challenged actions could have caused the Indian Health Service to inadvertently send the Request for Corrective Action Plan to Plaintiff instead of the OTIW. The Indian Health Service's letter was a response to an audit submitted by the OTIW.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 31-1 at 2. Thus, the Indian Health Service was clearly aware of which entity it was dealing with when it mistakenly sent the Request for Corrective Action Plan to Plaintiff. Given that the Indian Health Services knew which entity it intended to deal with, the Court finds it implausible that this mistake could be traced back to the Department's actions at issue. For the reasons previously discussed, the approval of the name-change amendment would not cause this sort of confusion as it only approved a change to an internal governing document. It is not the sort of public change that could have caused this mistake. Further, the list of federally recognized tribal entities only serves to verify that a tribal entity has been federally recognized. The mistake in the correspondence occurred well past the stage where the Indian Health Services would have needed to confirm the OTIW's status as a federally recognized tribal entity. As such, the Department's actions have not directly caused this confusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Plaintiff has also failed to show that the Department's actions could be a substantial factor in causing the OTIW to engage in any misleading or confusing use of \"Oneida Nation.\" Authorizing an entity to use a name does not \"license the commission of what would otherwise be a tortious act.\"\n   <em>\n    Hulburt Oil &amp; Grease Co. v.

Further, the section of the Code of Federal Regulations pertinent to the federal recognition and publication of tribal entities does not include any rules allowing the Department to deny federal recognition or refuse to publish said recognition based on a tribal entity's chosen name.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2083.6\">\n    25 C.F.R. \u00a7 83.6\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Given that the Department does not have rules or procedures in place to reject a tribal entity's proposed name, the Court concludes that the Department's actions did not grant the OTIW any particular rights to the \"Oneida Nation\" name that could be used against Plaintiff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   The Department cannot be held responsible for the OTIW engaging in conduct in which it was already entitled to engage. The Department did not suddenly grant the OTIW permission to use \"Oneida\" in a previously forbidden manner, so any lawful use of \"Oneida\" was always permissible. Similarly any unlawful use of \"Oneida\" was always unlawful and would leave the OTIW liable to Plaintiff. Such a reckless course of action by the OTIW would clearly be independent conduct and not traceable to the Department's actions currently at issue. Thus, the Court finds that any confusing or misleading use of \"Oneida\" by the OTIW would not be traceable to the Department's approval of the OTIW's constitutional amendment to change its name or identification of the OTIW as \"Oneida Nation\" in the list of federally recognized tribal entities in the Federal Register.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Even Plaintiff's single concrete example of an action take by the OTIW that might cause confusion-the OTIW's attempt to name a golf tournament the \"Oneida LPGA Classic\"-cannot be causally traced to the Department.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   First, the name of the tournament was announced before the OTIW's name change was published in the Federal Register, making it impossible that the List's identification of the OTIW as \"Oneida Nation\" caused the OTIW to name the tournament the \"Oneida LPGA Classic.\" Second, the OTIW's name always contained \"Oneida,\" so the fact that the OTIW named the tournament the \"Oneida LPGA Classic\" is not traceable to the Department's approval of the OTIW's constitutional amendment. The \"Oneida LPGA Classic\" would be an equally fitting title for a tournament hosted by the Oneida Tribe of Indians of Wisconsin as it would be for a tournament hosted by the Oneida Nation, so there is no reason to believe that the OTIW would have selected a different name for the golf tournament had the Department rejected the amendment. As such, Plaintiff has failed to demonstrate that any confusion could be traced to the Department.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.
