The Court denied this request and granted summary judgment for Defendants on Count IX because Plaintiffs did not establish that the HIPF itself was unlawful.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mar. 5, 2018 Mem. Op. &amp; Order 61, ECF No. 88. However, the Court did not address Plaintiffs' requests in \u00b6\u00b6 J-K for a permanent injunction against Defendants from either: (1) denying Medicaid funds to Plaintiffs based on their refusal to pay the HIPF; or (2) refusing to approve Plaintiffs' proposed Medicaid capitation rates based on Plaintiffs' failure to account for the HIPF.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1340384\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/514/527/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Because the Court has not yet entered final judgment in this case, the Court's August 4, 2016 Order dismissing Count VII, and its March 5, 2018 Order rendering summary judgment on all other counts, are both interlocutory.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FED.

As detailed in the Court's March 5, 2018 Order on summary judgment, HHS enacted the Certification Rule, which empowered a private entity-the Actuarial Standards Board (the \"ASB\")-to require Plaintiffs to account and pay for the HIPF in their MCO capitation rates in order to receive Medicaid funds.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mar. 5, 2018 Mem. Op. &amp; Order 3-9, ECF No. 88. The ASB accomplished this by requiring Plaintiffs to conform to Actuarial Standard of Practice (\"ASOP\") 49, which declared that capitation rates must account for the HIPF in order to be \"actuarially sound\" under federal law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 8. Under the Certification Rule, HHS would only approve capitation rates certified by private actuaries as complying with ASOP 49.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 41-43. In this way, HHS disobeyed the ACA's clear statutory command exempting the states from paying the HIPF. However, Plaintiffs have not shown that HHS will, going forward, refuse to approve future MCO capitation rates that do not account for the HIPF. In lieu of the Court's declaration that the Certification Rule is unlawful, the Court must assume that HHS will follow the law going forward. Plaintiffs have not rebutted that presumption.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Because Plaintiffs have not shown a substantial threat of irreparable injury, Plaintiffs have not carried their burden of establishing a need for permanent injunctive relief.
