Bush Chief, U.S. Magistrate Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Pending before the Court is Plaintiffs' Motion for Preliminary Injunction (Dkt. No. 30). The Court has heard oral argument from counsel and has carefully considered the record. Being fully advised, the Court enters the following Memorandum Decision and Order:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     SUMMARY OF DECISION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Bureau of Land Management (\"BLM\") is a federal agency that, among other things, handles the leasing of oil and gas rights on certain federal lands. The procedures that BLM follows in doing so changed earlier this year when it put into place an Instruction Memorandum (\"IM\"), supplying new instructions to the agency's offices about how to handle such leases. This new directive is known as IM 2018-034.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Plaintiffs Western Watersheds Project and Center for Biological Diversity (collectively \"WWP\" or Plaintiffs) contend that IM 2018-034 unlawfully constrains environmental review of, and public participation in, BLM oil and gas lease decisions that affect and threaten sage-grouse populations and habitats across the western United States. WWP asks the Court to stop BLM, through a preliminary injunction, from conducting oil and gas lease sales under the procedures of IM 2018-034 and instead follow the requirements which existed previously - specifically those contained in IM 2010-117 (issued in 2010, during\n   the prior presidential administration) - until the legal challenges to IM 2018-034 can be adjudicated on the merits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   After the Complaint was filed, two parties, the State of Wyoming (\"Wyoming\") and an oil and gas industry association known as Western Energy Alliance (\"WEA\"), asked the Court to allow their intervention to participate in the lawsuit, which the Court allowed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On September 6, 2018, the Court conducted a hearing to consider WWP's request for a preliminary injunction. The Court took under advisement the arguments of the parties, both in the written briefing and the oral argument, and now issues this Memorandum Decision and Order upon the Motion for a Preliminary Injunction. Under the legal standards that apply to preliminary injunctions and the requirements of federal law found in the Federal Land Policy and Management Act (\"FLPMA\"), the National Environmental Policy Act (\"NEPA\"), and the Administrative Procedure Act (\"APA\"), the Court concludes that Plaintiffs have shown a substantial case for success on the merits of their claims and that irreparable harm is likely to result in the absence of an injunction. Further, the Court concludes, after a weighing of the equities and the public interest, that such equities tip in favor of, and the public interest is best served by, granting the Motion. Although this Memorandum Decision and Order reflects that the Court is persuaded on the present record that Plaintiffs have a likelihood of success on the merits, this is\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   a final decision on the merits of the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The preliminary injunction requires that, for oil and gas leases scheduled for the fourth quarter of 2018 and thereafter, BLM must (1) re-implement certain provisions contained in IM 2010-117 as to the nature of, and time periods for, public involvement and protest in the oil and gas leasing process; and (2) discontinue the use of conflicting procedures contained in IM 2018-034. In general, the requirement that BLM return to the provisions of IM 2010-117 on these specific matters will allow a fuller opportunity for public involvement and comment in BLM's decision-making processes affecting potential oil and gas leases on federal lands in areas of federally-recognized sage-grouse habitat. Doing so will remedy for present purposes the harm and hardships caused by BLM's curtailment or preclusion of the opportunity for meaningful public participation in the oil and gas leasing process (as implemented in IM 2018-034), which on the present record appears to violate public participation requirements of both FLPMA and NEPA. Further, the requirements of the preliminary injunction will serve the public interest by providing BLM with the benefit of more meaningful public participation in the agency decision-making process. The details of what is required of BLM to comply with the preliminary injunction are found in the body of this Memorandum Decision and Order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The preliminary injunction does\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   apply to BLM oil and gas lease procedures on federal lands that are not within federally-recognized boundaries encompassing greater sage-grouse habitat management areas (as described and depicted more fully below). Plaintiffs contend that their standing to bring this lawsuit and the alleged injuries they have suffered or will suffer are directly tied to those areas of the federally-owned or federally-managed lands. Further, the preliminary injunction does not apply to oil and gas leases that have been the subject of sales already conducted or that are currently scheduled in the remainder of the third quarter of 2018. For those oil and gas leases, the weighing of the hardships and the public interest does not tip in favor of Plaintiffs, but rather tips in Defendants' favor, and those who have received such leases or are\n   bidding, or have bid, upon such leases. Finally, the preliminary injunction does not affect the existing six-month \"Parcel Review Timeframe\" implemented in IM 2018-034.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Broadly speaking, this case challenges what WWP contends are unlawful actions by the Trump Administration, through Federal Defendants, to promote and expedite oil and gas leasing on public lands that, according to WWP, \"will adversely impact essential habitats and populations across the range of the greater sage-grouse ..., and violate bedrock environmental laws including [FLPMA], [NEPA], and the [APA].\" Compl. \u00b6 1 (Dkt. 1). More specifically, WWP alleges that Federal Defendants have issued a series of orders, scientific reports, and directives that cast aside and disregard previously implemented protections for sage-grouse populations. At the same time, contends WWP, such actions also limit or preclude opportunities for public involvement during the oil and gas leasing process - materializing (as of the time that WWP initiated this case) in eight \"final\" BLM oil and gas lease sales (three in Montana, one in Utah, and four in Wyoming) that impact sage-grouse habitats.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 1-14, 73-225.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   WWP challenges these leasing actions as violating the 2015 Sage-Grouse Plan Amendments to BLM Resource Management Plans, FLPMA, NEPA, and the APA.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 276-307. WWP additionally challenges two recently-implemented BLM IMs that WWP claims revised BLM oil and gas leasing and development decision process without any public procedures (notice and comment) or environmental review: (1) IM 2018-026, which overrides the \"prioritization\" requirement of the 2015 Sage-Grouse Plan Amendments (prioritizing oil and gas leasing outside of identified sage-grouse habitat); and (2) IM 2018-034, which impacts environmental analysis of oil and gas leasing and development decisions, while limiting public notice and involvement in those decisions.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 98-112.

Opp. to Mot. for PI 18-19 (\"IM 2018-034 does not create new binding substantive requirements and it gives BLM officials ample discretion in conducting the leasing process - in fact, it gives BLM more discretion than the previous guidance in IM 2010-117.\"). But this self-serving position largely ignores the definitive pronouncements contained within IM 2018-034 that more accurately frame the scene. Those directive provisions make clear that IM 2018-034 is markedly different than IM 2010-117, and illustrate that IM 2018-034 expressly changes how BLM conducts its oil and gas leasing.\n   <em>\n    See supra.\n   </em>\n   Where there once was no deadline for BLM review of nominated lease parcels, IM 2018-034 now imposes a 6-month review period; where public participation in the NEPA review process was absolutely permitted, IM 2018-034 now leaves whether to have any public participation to BLM's discretion; where there was a 30-day public review and comment period for every lease sale, IM 2018-034 now eliminates that requirement; and, where there had been a 30-day protest period, IM 2018-034 now imposes a 10-day deadline for public protests of proposed lease sales, including sales as to which no specific prior public participation had been allowed.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   IM 2010-117 \u00a7\u00a7 III.A, III.C.7, III.E, IV.B,\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   IM 2018-034 \u00a7\u00a7 III.A, III.B.5, III.D, III.H.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   Even if some strands of discretion are involved in the layers of these provisions, they collectively prescribe and require an unmistakably different regulatory framework in which BLM now handles its oil and gas lease parcel reviews and leasing decisions and, likewise, in which WWP is (or, WWP contends, is not) able to participate in the same. As such, IM 2018-034 has practical effects on both BLM\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   WWP's rights and obligations in a manner different than IM 2010-117.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    W.

The result of an untimely protest may be the same under either IM, but the fact that the IM 2018-034 deadline is only one-third as long as previously prescribed (and a ten day period which includes non-business days) greatly increases the peril of a member of the public missing the deadline, or being unable to finish the work upon a protest within the time period allowed. This risk is compounded by the overlapping comment and protest periods, combined with accelerated oil and gas lease parcel reviews generally, all of which are left in the wake of IM 2018-034.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. 1 to Stellberg Decl. (illustrative table setting forth schedules for September 2018 and December 2018 oil and gas lease sales in BLM's western states, including public comment opportunities and protest deadlines). Plus, the burden of such constraints upon public participation and compressed protest periods falls most heavily upon members of the public, as those who have nominated potential lease parcels and BLM have had far more time to evaluate and consider the details of such parcels.

Conflicts are not unusual over decisions made by federal agencies, such as BLM, who have the responsibility to make those decisions and there is a well-understood zone of discretion in the law that is given to agencies in the consideration, making, and implementation of such decisions. As referenced earlier in this Memorandum Decision and Order, that discretion is hard-baked into the APA.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   (citing\n   <extracted-citation index=\"180\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20706\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2)(A), (C), (D) ;\n   <em>\n    River Runners for Wilderness\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3516454\" index=\"181\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/593/1064/#p1067\">\n    593 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1067 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   But in this case, the record contains significant evidence indicating that BLM made an intentional decision to limit the opportunity for (and even in some circumstances to preclude entirely) any contemporaneous public involvement in decisions concerning whether to grant oil and gas leases on federal lands. BLM has discretion in those spaces,\n   <em>\n    so long as\n   </em>\n   the decisions made meet the requirements of the law - specifically, here, FLPMA and NEPA. The evidence illustrates that the intended result of the at-issue decisions was to dramatically reduce and even eliminate public participation in the future decision-making process. Doing so certainly serves to meet the stated \"purpose\" of IM 2018-034 - that is, reducing or precluding public participation will \"streamline the leasing process to alleviate unnecessary impediments and burdens, to expedite the offering of lands for lease ....\" IM 2018-034, \"Purpose\" p. 1. Yet, the route chosen by BLM to reach that destination is problematic because the public involvement requirements of FLPMA and NEPA cannot be set aside in the name of expediting oil and gas lease sales. The benefits of\n   public involvement and the mechanism by which public involvement is obtained are not \"unnecessary impediments and burdens.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   In summary, IM 2018-034 is subject to judicial scrutiny under the APA as a reviewable agency action. And, where IM 2018-034 appears to be both procedurally and substantively invalid under FLPMA and NEPA, the APA is likewise implicated. The Court's findings on these points (as preliminary as they may be) are the product of applying the law to IM 2018-034's blueprint - which, when done, reveals that WWP has a reasonable likelihood of prevailing on its related FLPMA, NEPA, and APA claims. To be clear, this conclusion is grounded in the requirements of the statutes - the Court is not substituting its judgment in place of BLM's; nor, obviously, is the Court blindly rubber-stamping BLM's decisions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   <strong>\n    C. WWP Is Likely to Suffer Irreparable Harm\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   Pointing to BLM's ongoing use of IM 2018-034 - with its shortened (or no) public comment and protest periods - WWP argues that it and the public will be irreparably harmed in three ways: (1) the environmental or aesthetic harms to public lands threatened by oil and gas leases; (2) the bureaucratic commitment to continued oil and gas leasing projects without unbiased examinations of their environmental impacts; and (3) the inability to fully and effectively contribute to whatever public participation process\n   <em>\n    may\n   </em>\n   take place due to IM 2018-034's significantly-compressed deadlines.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   WWP's Mem. ISO Mot. for PI 30-35. The Court generally agrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   IM 2018-034 limits WWP's ability to participate in the oil and gas leasing process, likely causing WWP (and groups like WWP) irreparable harm in the absence of an injunction.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Kraayenbrink\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"182\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2006%20WL%202348080\">\n    2006 WL 2348080\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at * 8 (\"The public input of groups like WWP will be limited ... and irreparable harm could result from the BLM making decisions without the full public input mandated by NEPA.\").

In this light, the suggested benefits of proceeding with the fourth quarter oil and gas lease sales using IM 2018-034 are outweighed by the benefit of returning a fuller opportunity for public participation, consistent with IM 2010-117.

Hence, their financial status is not clear from the record, and the contention that they are non-profit environmental groups is not a basis to conclude that they possess insufficient resources to post a bond when seeking injunctive relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-188\">\n   Although this nettlesome issue is sometimes glossed over, it was touched upon in the\n   <em>\n    Earth Island\n   </em>\n   decision. There, the intervenor defendants pointed out that the plaintiffs' (also non-profit environmental groups) 2004 published tax returns show total year-end assets of $5.99 million for Earth Island Institute and $2.35 million for the Center for Biological Diversity (also a Plaintiff in this case) and argued\n   that the plaintiffs \" 'should be able to afford a sizeable bond' without potentially thwarting the viability of environmental citizen actions.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Earth Island\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"208\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2006%20WL%203359192\">\n    2006 WL 3359192\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *2 (citation omitted). The court, however, required a $1,000 bond, indicating that the plaintiffs had \"proffered evidence that an increased bond would severely impact their ability to pursue environmental litigation through this case and others.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"209\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2006%20WL%203359192\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ; see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at *2-3 (discussing declarations addressing impact of substantial bond and how assets reflected on tax returns are not indicative of discretionary funds available to pay \"dramatically increased bond amount\");\n   <em>\n    compare with\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Save Our Sonoran\n   </em>\n   , 408 F.3d at 1126 (upholding $50,000 bond where plaintiff had opportunity at bond hearing to show that \"imposition of anything other than a nominal bond would constitute an undue hardship,\" but plaintiff \"did not tender such evidence at the hearing\"). Plaintiffs offer up no such evidence here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-189\">\n   There is, in addition to those uncertain details, the further uncertainty of what \"costs and damages\" will be \"sustained\" by BLM if, after the case is fully considered on the merits, it is found that BLM was wrongfully enjoined or restrained. That is the touchstone of Rule 65(c). BLM has contended that there will be need for, in effect, some backtracking in developing and posting updated sales schedules as well as the need to publish press releases to inform the public of the extensions of the comment/protest periods.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Wells Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 7-8. There perhaps would be some overlap of personnel effort from what has been done to what needs to be done, and perhaps some additional hard costs, but in an electronic communication age any such hard costs would be minimal. The time and effort of employees in doing that rewind would also be minimal, as the details of the changes are limited and the revised process by which the potential sales will be considered and implemented is already a path on the agency's floorboards. Further, as to the effort already expended on such potential sales by persons or entities connected to the Defendant-Intervenors, there is no reason to believe that any of that effort and expense will go to waste. If the circumstances after a greater opportunity for public involvement support a sale, then the sale will occur. If the circumstances after a greater opportunity for public involvement do not support a sale, or result in BLM placing conditions for the sale to meet other responsibilities of the agency in regard to protecting sage-grouse or other environmental interests, then the purposes of FLPMA and NEPA have been met and there is little if any room for a potential lessee, or a successful lessee, to feel aggrieved.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-190\">\n   In consideration of the matters described above, and in the exercise of the Court's discretion, the Court concludes that a bond amount of $10,000.00 is sufficient in this case.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   The injunction is effective immediately.

Such revenues are inchoate unless and until leases are issued and production obtained.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"17\">\n   <p id=\"p-220\">\n    Weighing the nature of WWP's alleged organizational hardship is an imprecise task. WWP has submitted declarations stating that the changes in the oil and gas leasing process has disrupted the organization's usual work patterns, has caused difficulty in being able to meet the workload that has been created (in scope and in quality), and requires that some staff people work long hours and take time away from other responsibilities. Such difficulties may arise from a shortage of qualified personnel, or a lack of resources to hire additional staff people, or an internal decision about allocation of the organization's resources. But the hardships described in this record do not necessarily go away with IM 2010-117. Nor is the fact of having too much work to do in a short amount of time a hardship that is, for some reason, weightier than similar challenges faced by other litigants in the lawsuits that WWP brings. Perhaps WWP could hire more people or prioritize resources in a different manner. Those are the choices of the organization, not a place for supposition or imposition by the Court. Ultimately, however, such issues do not preclude entry of injunctive relief, given the full extent and nature of the irreparable harm involved here.\n    <em>\n     See supra.\n    </em>\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"18\">\n   <p id=\"p-221\">\n    WWP filed a \"suggestion\" at the outset of this case, requesting that case be reassigned\n    <em>\n     sua sponte\n    </em>\n    to U.S. District Judge B.

That knowledge and experience is useful and directly relevant to the adjudication of the claims presented in this case, including because this case presents Second and Third Claims for Relief (Complaint \u00b6\u00b6 285-307) which allege that BLM is violating FLPMA, NEPA, and the APA in not applying the best available science in approving the oil and gas leasing and development decisions challenged in this case.\").\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"19\">\n   <p id=\"p-222\">\n    Aside from noting the \"several months preparing for the many lease sales\" and the related time and effort involved with \"postpon[ing] the lease sales and redo[ing] the NEPA public comment processes and protest periods for several different lease sales,\" Federal Defendants do not tender any substantive evidence on the issue, nor do they specifically respond to WWP's argument that Rule 65(c)'s security requirement be waived. The Defendant-Intervenors similarly focus upon the time, effort and expense expended by those who would bid upon such leases, if offered, and upon the revenues lost to the state and federal government and the affected states.\n    <em>\n     See supra.\n    </em>\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"20\">\n   <p id=\"p-223\">\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.,\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     W.
