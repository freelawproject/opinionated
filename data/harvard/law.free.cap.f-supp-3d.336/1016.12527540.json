Sheet, 2016 Reg. Sess. H.B. 2617. Arizona's House Bill 2617 was codified at Arizona Revised Statute \u00a7 35-393.01, and states in subsection (A) that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-10\">\n   A public entity may not enter into a contract with a company to acquire or dispose of services, supplies, information technology or construction unless the contract includes a written certification that the company is not currently engaged in, and agrees for the duration of the contract to not engage in, a boycott of Israel.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   A.R.S. \u00a7 35-393.01(A) (hereafter, \"Certification Requirement\" or \"the Act\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Act defines \"boycott\" as:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   ...engaging in a refusal to deal, terminating business activities or performing other actions that are intended to limit commercial relations with Israel or with persons or entitles doing business in Israel or in territories controlled by Israel, if those actions are taken either:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   (a) In compliance with or adherence to calls for a boycott of Israel other than those boycotts to which 50 United States Code \u00a7 4607(c) applies.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   (b) In a matter that discriminates on the basis of nationality, national origin or religion and that is not based on a valid business reason.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   A.R.S. \u00a7 35-393(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Plaintiff Mikkel Jordahl (\"Mr. Jordahl\") is an attorney and sole owner of Plaintiff Mikkel (Mik) Jordahl, P.C. (\"the Firm\") (collectively, \"Plaintiffs\"). Mr. Jordahl personally participates in a boycott of consumer goods and services offered by businesses supporting Israel's occupation of the Palestinian territories. In doing so, Mr. Jordahl claims that he is moved by the Peace Not Walls campaign promoted by the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (\"ELCA\"). The ELCA calls on \"individuals to invest in Palestinian products to build their economy and to utilize selective purchasing to avoid buying products made\n   in illegal Israeli settlements built on Palestinian land.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mr. Jordahl is also a non-Jewish member of Jewish Voice for Peace (\"JVP\"), which \"endorses the call from Palestinian civil society for Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions campaigns to protest the Israeli government's occupation of Palestinian territories.\" (Doc. 6 at 4). Mr. Jordahl would like the Firm to participate in his boycott of \"all businesses operating in Israeli settlements in the occupied Palestinian territories.\" (Doc. 57 at 6:6-7). He would also like his Firm \"to be able to associate and provide financial resources and legal resources to Jewish Voice for Peace.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6:8-10).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   For the past twelve years, Mr. Jordahl's firm has contracted with the Coconino County Jail District (\"the County\") to provide legal advice to incarcerated individuals. In 2016, following the passage of A.R.S. \u00a7 35-393.01, the County asked Mr. Jordahl to execute a written certification, on the Firm's behalf, that the Firm \"is not currently engaged in a boycott of Israel,\" that \"no wholly owned subsidiaries, majority-owned subsidiaries, parent companies, or affiliates\" of the Firm are \"engaged in a boycott of Israel,\" and that neither the Firm nor any of the above-mentioned associated entities would \"engage in a boycott of Israel\" for the duration of the contract agreement. (Doc. 6-1, Ex. 1). The requested certification went on to state that \"Any violation of this Certification by the Independent Contractor shall constitute an event of material breach of the Agreement.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Mr. Jordahl signed the 2016 certification under protest (\"2016 Certification\"), and sought confirmation with the County that the certification would not apply to his personal consumer decisions. (Doc. 6-1 at Exs. 1 &amp; 2). The County did not respond to his inquiry but paid the Firm for its services during that year. During the contract year, Mr. Jordahl claims that he turned down opportunities for his Firm to provide administrative and pro bono services to organizations like JVP and he personally refrained from speaking out vocally about his personal boycott participation for fear that it might cast suspicion that his Firm was engaging in activity prohibited under the 2016 Certification. (Doc. 6-1 at 4-6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The Firm's contract with the County came up for renewal in 2017, and the County again asked Mr. Jordahl to sign the required certification (\"the 2017 Certification\"), which by that time had been approved by the County's Jail Board of Directors. (Doc. 6 at 10; Doc. 6-1 at Ex. 5). The 2017 Certification was substantially unchanged from the 2016 Certification. This time, Mr. Jordahl refused to sign. (Doc. 6-1 at 5-6). Notwithstanding his refusal to sign, the Firm has continued to provide representative services to the County under the contract; the County, however, has not paid the Firm for those services. Mr. Jordahl fears that he will lose approximately 10% of his total income if his Firm loses its contract with the County as a result of his refusal to sign the 2017 Certification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In their Amended Complaint, Plaintiffs allege that section 35-393.01 violates the First and Fourteenth Amendments because it requires the Firm and other government contractors to disavow their participation in political boycotts or risk forfeiting the opportunity to work for the government. (Doc. 21 \u00b6 1). Plaintiffs brought suit against the Arizona Attorney General (\"the Attorney General\"), the Coconino County Sheriff (\"the Sheriff\"), and various members of the Coconino County Jail District Board of Directors (\"the Board\") in their official\n   capacities (collectively, \"the Defendants\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Thereafter, the parties consented to, and the Court granted, the State of Arizona's (\"the State\") request to intervene for the purpose of defending the facial constitutionality of the Act. (Docs. 24 &amp; 48).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Plaintiffs have moved for a preliminary injunction in which they seek to have the Court enjoin Defendants from enforcing the Certification Requirement in A.R.S. \u00a7 35-393.01, or alternatively to enjoin Defendants from enforcing the Certification Requirement against them. (Doc. 6 at 1). Defendants oppose Plaintiffs' motion for injunctive relief and contend that Plaintiffs are unlikely to succeed on the merits and that their alleged injuries are insufficient to justify injunctive relief. (Doc. 28 at 37). The State, joined by the Attorney General (\"Defendants\" or \"the State\"), has also moved to dismiss Plaintiffs' complaint. (Doc. 28). In doing so, Defendants challenge Plaintiffs' standing and argue that to the extent the Act applies to Plaintiffs' conduct, the Court should abstain or certify the question of the scope of the Act to the Arizona Supreme Court. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Citing state sovereign immunity, standing, and ripeness issues, Defendants specifically seek to dismiss the Attorney General from the case. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 32-33).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The Court held oral argument on these issues on May 23, 2018. (Doc. 50). The parties continued to file documents with the Court after this hearing, including Plaintiffs' Notice that the State had misstated Arizona law during oral argument regarding the Attorney General's authority to offer opinions on the meaning of Arizona law (Doc. 58); Plaintiffs' Notice that Plaintiffs' counsel had misattributed a fact to the wrong authority during their oral argument (Doc. 59); and the State's Notice of Supplemental Authority regarding updates (1) to an Arizona Agency Handbook providing interpretative guidance on A.R.S. \u00a7 35-393 and (2) on\n   <em>\n    Koontz v. Watson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12522697\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/283/1007/\">\n    283 F.Supp.3d 1007\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D. Kan. 2018), a case relied upon by Plaintiffs, which since oral argument has been voluntary dismissed as a result of a settlement (Doc. 61). Defendants responded to Plaintiff's notice of misstatement (Doc. 60) and Plaintiffs have responded to the State's supplemental authority (Doc. 62). The Court has considered these filings in its decision, and where necessary, has addressed them below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The Court will first resolve the issues and concerns related to Plaintiffs' standing and the Court's retention of this case. The Court will then turn to the merits of Plaintiffs' Motion for Preliminary Injunction and ascertain whether Plaintiffs have met their burden of showing that the Certification Requirement runs afoul of First Amendment protections afforded to Arizona companies wishing to engage in \"boycott[s] of Israel\", as that term is defined in the Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Standing\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In moving to dismiss the Plaintiffs' First Amended Complaint, the State argues that Plaintiffs do not have standing to challenge the constitutionality of the Act because their desired conduct is not covered by its terms. Defendants also contend that Plaintiffs do not have standing to sue the Attorney General because he has not enforced the Act, and does not have the authority to do so. Because a party that lacks standing divests the court of jurisdiction to hear the case, the Court will address the standing inquiries at the threshold.\n   <em>\n    See e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Fleck v.

Plaintiffs Have Standing to Challenge the Constitutionality of the Act\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The State first argues that Plaintiffs have no standing to challenge the constitutionality of the Certification Requirement because the conduct that Plaintiffs say they desire to engage in \"does not fall within the narrow scope of the Act\" and as a result, they \"will suffer no irreparable injury absent an injunction.\" (Doc. 28 at 8). As far as the Court can tell, the State seems to think Plaintiffs are only harmed if they actually breach the contract by engaging in the prohibited activity. Thus, because Plaintiffs have not engaged in activity that falls within the statutory definition, Defendants say Plaintiffs cannot establish they have been injured by the Certification Requirement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The Court first notes that \"[s]tanding, or the lack of it, may be intertwined with whether the complaint states a claim upon which relief can be granted, but it is not the same thing.

Mr. Jordahl has established that were it not for the Certification Requirement,\n   he would extend his boycott participation to his Firm's consumer choices. (Doc. 6-1 \u00b6 24). For example, he would \"refuse to purchase Hewlett Packard equipment for [the Firm] because of Hewlett Packard's provision of information technology services used by Israeli checkpoints throughout the West Bank.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) He would further like his Firm to provide administrative, financial, and pro bono legal services to organizations like JVP that \"employ[ ] boycott, divestment, and sanctions tactics to put political pressure on Israel\" but has not done so because he believes these actions will run afoul of the Certification. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 25-6). The Firm thus sustained injuries-in-fact when the County conditioned the Firm's contracts on a promise to refrain from engaging in this protected course of conduct and the Firm refrained from engaging in such actions for fear of breaching the contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Moreover, when Mr. Jordahl refused to sign the 2017 Certification on behalf of the Firm, the County stopped paying the Firm for its services. In this regard, the Firm has not only experienced \"a realistic danger of sustaining a direct injury as a result of the statute's operation or enforcement,\" it has actually sustained injury: it is not getting paid for services rendered due to its refusal to sign the certification.\n   <em>\n    Bayless\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9328867\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/320/1002/#p1006\">\n    320 F.3d at 1006\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The Court finds, however, that Mr. Jordahl has sufficiently established his personal stake in the outcome of this controversy to challenge the constitutionality of the Certification Requirement. Although Mr. Jordahl is not a \"company\" under the Act, as the sole lawyer in a Firm that\n   <em>\n    is\n   </em>\n   required to sign the Certification to obtain the County contract, he has sufficiently established that his personal conduct, at least some of which would be prohibited by the Act, has been impermissibly chilled for fear that it may be confused with the Firm's conduct. For example, Mr. Jordahl has averred that in response to calls from JVP, the ELCA, and other \"Boycott Divestment and Sanction\" organizations, he has ceased purchasing products from Hewlett-Packard, Airbnb, and SodaStream, all which are companies that are \"doing business...in territories controlled by Israel.\" \u00a7 35-393.01(A). He says he has ceased some of these political activities for fear that they may be confused with those of his Firm's. Where a plaintiff has refrained from engaging in expressive activity for fear of prosecution under the challenged statute, such self-censorship is a \"constitutionally sufficient injury\" as long as it is based on \"an actual and well-founded fear\" that the challenged statute will be enforced.\n   <em>\n    Human Life of Wash., Inc. v.

The second requirement is also not met because Defendants have failed to show how a dispositive ruling on a \"state issue\" would avoid the need for constitutional adjudication.

Defendants interpret \"the Act's requirement not to engage in a 'boycott of Israel' to mean that the boycott is actually a general boycott of Israel-i.e., a broad or total boycott of Israel such as those called for by the Boycott, Divest and Sanctions ('BDS') movement, to which the Act is squarely addressed.\" (Doc. 28 at 7).

Indeed, this position presupposes that Arizona can constitutionally condition a company's right to engage in \"a general boycott of Israel\" that is taken in response to a larger call for such action on receipt of any public contract. But as the Court discusses\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   , to justify such a broad restriction, regulation of activity that infringes on expressive boycotting activities must be \"necessary\" to the \"actual operation of the government.\"\n   <em>\n    U.S. v.

The Court again finds that Defendants interpret the protections of the First Amendment too narrowly. The fact that the Act does not expressly limit or restrain what Plaintiffs can\n   <em>\n    say\n   </em>\n   does not mean that protected conduct is not affected by its terms.

The Act requires contracting companies to promise to refrain from engaging in certain conduct if done at the behest of outside \"calls\" to boycott Israel. The Act thus clearly aims to suppress expressive conduct that may be \"directed to community groups, to city and state legislators, to state and federal officials, and even to family members and friends,\" and is not limited - or even directed - to the Firm's legal representation of criminal defendants.\n   <em>\n    Moonin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266245\" index=\"252\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/868/853/#p861\">\n    868 F.3d at 863\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (policy prohibiting \"direct contact\" between employee and \"ANY non-departmental and non-law enforcement entity or persons for the purpose of discussing [program]\" covered speech outside the employees' official duties).

The Certification Requirement applies to any company that provides \"services, supplies, information technology or construction\" to a public entity in Arizona. A.R.S. \u00a7 35-393.01(A). The scope of \"official duties\" that are encompassed by the number and diversity of companies contracting with the State vary dramatically and the plain language of the Certification Requirement does not limit its scope to prohibit actions taken in furtherance of those duties.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Moonin\n   </em>\n   , 868 F.3d at n.5 (noting that the \"focus in the prospective restraint context is on the chilling effect of the employer's policy on employee speech\" which is \"determined by the language of the policy - what an employee reading the policy would think the policy requires - not what [the employer] subjectively intended the [policy] to say\").

Indeed, by prohibiting certain actions taken in compliance with larger calls for boycotts of Israel, the Arizona legislature's plain definition of \"boycott\" underscores the public nature of the conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   Plaintiffs have thus met their burden of showing not only that they and others are engaged in protected activities, but that the terms of the Act encompass such activities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   <strong>\n    4.

Here, the State has proffered two interests to justify the Certification Requirement: (1) an interest in regulating the State's \"commercial activity to align commerce in the State with the State's policy objectives and values\" and (2) an interest in preventing discrimination on the basis of national origin. (Doc. 28 at 22-24).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   The legislative history of the Act calls these stated interests into doubt. The Act's history instead suggests that the goal of the Act is to penalize the efforts of those engaged in political boycotts of Israel and those doing business in Israeli-occupied territories because such boycotts are not aligned with the State's values.\n   <em>\n    See e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   Ariz.

Balance of the Equities and the Public Interest\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   The Court also finds that the balance of equities tips in favor of Plaintiffs. Defendants will experience little to no hardship by enjoining the enforcement of a law that does nothing to further any economic state interest and infringes on First Amendment protections. Although generally barring discrimination on the basis of national origin is a legitimate state interest, the State clearly has less intrusive and more viewpoint-neutral means to combat such discrimination. Plaintiffs, on the other hand, have shown a likelihood of irreparable harm if the Certification Requirement is not enjoined. Moreover, public interest favors an injunction as the public has little interest in enforcement of unconstitutional laws.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Security\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   A court may issue a preliminary injunction \"only if the movant gives security in an amount that the court considers proper to pay the costs and damages sustained by any party found to have been wrongfully enjoined or restrained.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 65(c). Although the plain language of the rule suggests that a bond is mandatory, the Ninth Circuit has held that it \"invests the district court with discretion as to the amount of security required, if any.\"\n   <em>\n    Johnson v.

Moreover, Plaintiffs have shown that they are likely to succeed\n   on the merits of their claim, that they are likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of a preliminary injunction, and that the balance of equities and public interest favor an injunction. The Court therefore will grant Plaintiffs' request for a preliminary injunction and enjoin Defendants from enforcing the Certification Requirement in A.R.S. \u00a7 35-393.01(A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that Plaintiffs' Motion for a Preliminary Injunction (Doc. 6) is\n   <strong>\n    granted\n   </strong>\n   .
