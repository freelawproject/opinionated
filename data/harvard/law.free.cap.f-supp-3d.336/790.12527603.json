(ECF No. 1.) This lawsuit arises from the suspension of Nationwide Recovery's towing permit and removal from the police authorized towing list without a pre-deprivation hearing. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Presently before the Court is Nationwide Recovery's Motion for Partial Summary Judgment, filed October 4, 2017. (ECF No. 24.) Defendant the City of Detroit filed a response and cross-motion for summary judgment on October 25, 2017. (ECF No. 41.) Finding the legal arguments in the brief sufficient, the Court is dispensing with oral arguments pursuant to L.R. 7.1(f)(2). For the reasons stated below, the Court grants Plaintiffs' motion for partial summary judgment, denies Defendants' cross-motion for partial summary judgment, and denies, as moot, Plaintiffs' motion to strike Argument V of Defendant's motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Factual and Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Nationwide Recovery is a towing service and operates a motor vehicle storage yard in Detroit, MI. (ECF No. 13.) Beginning in 2010, the City began issuing towing permits to qualified towing companies to conduct police authorized tows. (ECF No. 13 at Pg ID 152.) The Detroit City Code \u00a7 55-2-82(a) provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   The Board of Police Commissioners shall establish standards, including insurance and bonding requirements, that must be met in order for a tower to qualify for police authorized tows, under this chapter, and the Police Department shall maintain a current list of such qualified towers.... In accordance with Section 2-111 of the Charter, the Board of Police Commissioners shall promulgate administrative rules for the Body's determination as to which towers shall be called for tows under this chapter. Such rules shall provide, as nearly as practicable, for equitable distribution of police authorized towing to all towers on the list of qualified towers.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   According to Nationwide Recovery, the Board of Police Commissioners (\"BPC\"), Chief of Police, and then-mayor published \"Police Towing Rules\" in the\n   <em>\n    Detroit Legal News\n   </em>\n   on December 21, 2010. (ECF No. 24 at Pg ID 453.) The City prepared the towing application and checklist. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Detroit Police Officer Kenyatta Myers, who\n   was responsible for administering the police authorized tows, used the checklist to determine eligibility for the towers. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) After vetting the applicants, Officer Meyers consulted with the City's Finance Department, who, then, collected any administrative fees from the approved towers. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Thereafter, Officer Meyers compiled a complete list of eligible police authorized towers and forwarded the list to the BPC. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Those on the authorized towing list received a towing permit that was valid for a period of five years. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at Pg ID 454.) The permit was renewable every five years. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In 2011, the Deputy Police Chief executed the permits, and in 2016, Officer Meyers and the Chair of the BPC executed the permits. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The tow rate commission set the tow rate, which the City adopted and issued a resolution to the same. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at Pg ID 455.) The tow rate included an administrative fee that went directly to the City's Finance Department, a towing fee, and a daily storage fee. (ECF No. 24 at Pg ID 455; ECF No. 24-16 at Pg ID 670.) The City's Finance Director issued the most recent rate on May 28, 2013. (ECF No. 24 at Pg ID 455; ECF No. 24-11 at Pg ID 603.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In 2011, Nationwide Recovery became a holder of Detroit Police Department (\"DPD\") Tow Permit # 11-042, which was effective until May 2016. In May 2016, Nationwide Recovery renewed its permit and became the holder of Detroit Police Department Tow Permit # 16-047, which had an expiration date of May 31, 2021. (ECF No. 13 at Pg ID 153-54; ECF No. 24 at Pg ID 254.) On July 19, 2017, without notice or hearing, officers from the Detroit Police Department took possession of Nationwide Recovery's towing permit and, subsequently, removed its name from the towing list. (ECF No. 13 at Pg ID 155.) Although Nationwide Recovery, through its counsel, asked the City to provide a written notice detailing the suspension, the City never responded. (ECF No. 24 at Pg ID 456; ECF No. 24-2 at Pg ID 501.) According to Nationwide Recovery, BPC's towing rules recognize a property interest in holding a permit and being on the towing list, and, therefore, Nationwide Recovery was entitled to a pre-deprivation hearing prior to its towing suspension, termination, and revocation. (ECF No. 24 at Pg ID 456.) The towing rules provide as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   The City reserves the right to terminate any towing permit with a tow company in the event of a breach of the towing permit or any provision of the towing permit or of these Rules provided, however, that the permit holder shall be afforded an opportunity for a hearing before the Board of Commissioners or the Board's designee prior to the effective date of any such termination.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   The City may immediately terminate any towing permit with a tow company for fraud or criminal conduct by the tow company or its employees, provided however, that as soon as practicable the permit holder shall be afforded an opportunity for a hearing before the Board of Commissioners or the Board's designee following which hearing the Board shall either affirm or rescind the termination.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   (ECF No. 41-9 at Pg ID 1552.) On July 24, 2017, Nationwide Recovery initiated this lawsuit. (ECF No. 1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On August 9, 2017, the City's Corporation Counsel issued a memorandum to the Chief of Police that declared all towing permits, including that of Nationwide Recovery, \"null and void ab initio, and no tow company had or has any property right or interest in any purported permit.\" (ECF No. 24 at Pg ID 451; ECF No. 24-3.) The memorandum further stated that the BPC did not have authority to select, approve, or issue any company towing permits. (ECF No. 24-3 at Pg ID 503.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On August 14, 2017, the City filed a Counterclaim, as well as a Third-Party Complaint against Jerry Parker, Hussein M. Hussein, and Louay M. Hussein, all of whom are Nationwide Recovery officers and/or owners. (ECF No. 5.) In the City's Counterclaim and Third-Party Complaint, the City alleged, among other things, that Nationwide Recovery conspired to commit fraud and auto theft.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On September 5, 2017, Nationwide Recovery filed an Amended Complaint, adding a First Amendment retaliation claim. (ECF No. 13.) After twice amending its Counterclaim and Third-Party Complaint, on October 16, 2017, the City voluntarily withdrew its Counterclaim and Third-Party Complaint. (ECF Nos. 14, 18, &amp; 27.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On December 6, 2017, this Court granted Nationwide Recovery's request to amend its Complaint a second time to add additional parties and claims. (ECF Nos. 32 &amp; 57.) On December 29, 2017, Nationwide Recovery filed its Second Amended Complaint, adding (1) Jerry Parker, (2) Hussein M. Hussein, (3) Louay M. Hussein, (4) Annie Hussein, (5) Julia Hussein, and (6) Carol Hendon as Plaintiffs; (1) Charles N. Raimi, (2) Ronald G. Acho, and (3) Cummings, McClorey, Davis, &amp; Acho, P.C. as Defendants; and claims for intentional infliction of emotional distress, tortious interference with business expectancy and relationship, conspiracy to violate constitutional rights, and loss of consortium. (ECF No. 61.) Subsequently, on March 19, 2018 and April 10, 2018, Plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed all Defendants, except the City, as well as dismissed their claims for intentional infliction of emotional distress and tortious interference with business expectancy and relationship. (ECF Nos. 95 &amp; 105.) On February 16, 2018, the City filed a motion to dismiss. (ECF No. 81.) The motion has been fully briefed and is pending before the Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Applicable Law &amp; Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Although Plaintiffs filed a Second Amended Complaint since the filing of its motion for partial summary judgment, the parties and claims that were added have no bearing on the instant motions. Therefore, the Court will address the pending motions for partial summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Permit Is Not a Contract\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The City argues the permit was a contract and claims Nationwide Recovery cannot prove its permit was lawfully issued. The City relies on a number of contract cases to support its claims. However, the City has failed to show that the permit was a contract. The City argues the permit was a contract because the parties were governed by \"printed rules and mutually explicit understandings.\" (ECF No. 14 at Pg ID 1398.) While it is true that a property interest must derive from \"rules or understandings,\" the City's overly broad argument would characterize all claims for a property interest as a contract. A principle of due process is that a property interest must derive from an independent state source such as \"rules or understandings\" that secure certain benefits and support claims of entitlement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bd. of Regents State Colleges v. Roth\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1782964\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/408/564/#p577\">\n    408 U.S. 564\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 577,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1782964\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/408/564/#p577\">\n    92 S.Ct. 2701\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1782964\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/408/564/#p577\">\n    33 L.Ed.2d 548\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1972). Moreover, the City has not offered any evidence of consideration, and the Michigan Court of Appeals\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   has stated, \"[p]ayment of a simple license\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   or permit\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   fee is not such consideration that will support the existence of a contractual relationship.\"\n   <em>\n    Midwest Teen Ctrs., Inc. v. Roseville\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2090718\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mich-app/36/627/#p630\">\n    36 Mich. App. 627\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 630,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=193%20N.W.2d%20906\">\n    193 N.W.2d 906\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1971). As such, the Court is not persuaded that Nationwide Recovery's permit was a contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The Permit Is Not Contrary to the City Charter or City Code\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The City relies on \u00a7 4-122 of the City Charter, which provides that \"[t]he City may not purchase or in any way procure property or the services of independent contractors without approval by resolution of the City Council except as provided by ordinance.\" However, \u00a7 4-122 has a clearly defined exception that authorizes the City to procure services, if provided by ordinance. To that point, \u00a7 55-2-82 of the Detroit City Code authorizes the BPC to establish towing standards, as well as promulgate rules for the towers. It states, in part, \"The Board of Police Commissioners shall establish standards, including insurance and bonding requirements, that must be met in order for a tower to qualify for police authorized tows, under this chapter, and the Police Department shall maintain a current list of such qualified towers.\" It goes on to state, \"[i]n accordance with Section 2-111\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   of the Charter, the Board of Police Commissioners shall promulgate administrative rules for the Body's determination as to which towers shall be called for tows under this chapter.\" As such, and as authorized in \u00a7 7-803\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   , the BPC, Chief of Police, and then mayor established towing rules and standards consistent with the expressed authority of 55-2-82. Although Plaintiffs maintain BPC did not select, approve, or execute the permits, the City has provided no authority that would preclude the BPC from doing so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Further, the City argues that because the Commissioner of the BPC executed the permit, it essentially issued permits without authority. Again, there is nothing in the City Charter or City Code that prohibits the Commissioner of the BPC from executing the permits or, even, requiring the permits be executed. As mentioned, it is the BPC who establishes the towing rules and standards, and as such, executing the permit would not have been improper. Finally, because the BPC oversees DPD, it is not surprising that the Commissioner of the BPC would execute the permits following DPD's approval of a tower.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Therefore, the Court finds that the permit is not contrary to the City Charter or City Code.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    C. The Permit Is Not Contrary to State Law\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The City also relies on\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Mich.%20Comp.%20Laws%20%C2%A7%20117\">\n    Mich. Comp. Laws \u00a7 117\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .4s, which mandates that the City's Chief Financial Officer shall supervise all \"financial and budget activities\" of the City. The City asserts that towing is a financial activity that should have been under supervision of the City's Chief Financial Officer. The City advances the following arguments as to why towing is a financial activity and not properly supervised under the BPC: (1) towing implicates millions of dollars; (2) Nationwide Recovery was not eligible to receive a towing permit; (3) improper procurement procedures lead to expensive and disruptive litigation; and (4) procurement requires broad advertising to get the most qualified bidders. The Court is not persuaded by the City's arguments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The City's arguments as to the alleged improper procurement procedures and lack of broad advertising are irrelevant to\n   the question of whether towing is a financial activity. Such broad reasoning is inconsistent with \u00a7 4-122 of the City Charter, which allows for procurement exceptions. Further, the fact that towing generates millions of dollars does not automatically cause towing to fall within the purview of the statute.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Mich.%20Comp.%20Laws%20%C2%A7%20117\">\n    Mich. Comp. Laws \u00a7 117\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .4s became effective June 20, 2014. However, the City maintains that all permits issued in 2016 were\n   <em>\n    void ab initio.\n   </em>\n   If towing was a financial activity as the City claims, all permits issued after the effective date would have been\n   <em>\n    void ab initio\n   </em>\n   , including those issued in 2011. If the City intended towing to be a financial activity or outside the authority of the BPC, then the City Council would have made that clear. As it stands, nothing in state law prevents the issuance of the permits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Likewise,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Mich.%20Comp.%20Laws%20%C2%A7%20141.1636\">\n    Mich. Comp. Laws \u00a7 141.1636\n   </extracted-citation>\n   is inapplicable because it concerns \"applicable contracts,\" and, as set forth above, this Court has found the permit was not a contract. As to the City's eligibility argument, assuming Nationwide did not qualify for a permit because of its failure to pay City income taxes, then that issue should have been addressed in a hearing in accordance with the towing rules.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Therefore, the City's position is inconsistent with the City's regulatory scheme. None of the statutes or charter provisions the City relies upon invalidate Nationwide's permit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Procedural Due Process\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Now, the court turns to Plaintiffs' procedural due process argument. In Plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment, Plaintiffs argue that they had a property interest in Towing Permit # 16-047, and independent of the permit, they had a property interest in being on the list of authorized towing companies.

Nationwide Recovery's permit was more than a unilateral expectation; it was a conferred benefit and claim of entitlement. The BPC provided towing standards and rules, Nationwide Recovery applied for a towing permit, and DPD granted the permit. The permit had an expiration date of May 31, 2021. Nationwide Recovery's expectation was that the permit was good until its expiration, or, until terminated following a hearing as outlined in the towing rules. The Court recognizes the City's position that Nationwide Recovery was engaged in criminal conduct, and the City could immediately terminate the permit pursuant to the towing rules. While this is true, even if Nationwide Recovery was engaged in criminal conduct, the towing rules provided that as soon as practical \"the permit holder shall be afforded an opportunity for a hearing.\" (ECF No. 24-7 at Pg ID 579; ECF No. 41-9 at Pg ID 1552.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <strong>\n    2.

Pursuant to the towing rules, Nationwide Recovery was entitled to a hearing before the termination of its permit in the event of breach of the towing rules. (ECF No. 41-9 at Pg ID 1552.) The permit could be terminated immediately for fraud or criminal conduct. However, in accordance with the towing rules, \"as soon as practicable,\" Nationwide was entitled to a hearing. Neither happened in this case. Nationwide Recovery believed it would receive the benefit of the towing permit until its expiration or until a hearing determined otherwise. The City makes no argument that \u00a7 55-2-82 or the BPC's towing rules were in violation of any state or local law.
