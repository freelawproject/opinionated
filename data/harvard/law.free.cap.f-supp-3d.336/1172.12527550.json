(Doc. No. 429.) Plaintiff San Diego Comic Convention (\"SDCC\") opposes the motion in its entirety. (Doc. No. 468.) On May 31, 2018, the Court held a hearing on the motion and then took the matter under submission. (Doc. No. 504.) As the record does not permit a conclusion contrary to the jury's verdict, the Court\n   <strong>\n    DENIES\n   </strong>\n   DFP's Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 50 motion. (Doc. No. 429.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The Court is already well-versed as to the events leading up to the institution of this action. Thus, for the purposes of this Order, the Court will only provide a narrow review of this lawsuit's factual and procedural background.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On August 7, 2014, SDCC filed a lawsuit alleging two causes of action against DFP: (1) Federal Trademark Infringement,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201114\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1114\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; and (2) False Designation of Origin,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201125\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1125\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). (\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 1.) SDCC is a non-profit corporation, formed in 1975, that is dedicated to the awareness and appreciation of comics and related popular art forms. (Doc. No. 1 \u00b6 10.) Every year since 1970, SDCC has produced and held its \"Comic-Con convention\" in San Diego, California. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 11; Doc. No. 97 at 9.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The convention\n   spans several days in length and showcases several hundred events, workshops, educational and academic programs, games, award shows, costume contests, as well as hosts panels of special guests that include science fiction and fantasy authors, film and television actors, directors, producers, and writers. (Doc. No. 1 \u00b6 12; Doc. No. 97 at 9.) In 2016, attendance to San Diego Comic-Con exceeded over 135,000 attendees. (Doc. No. 97 at 9.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   SDCC's family of trademarks at issue in this case are:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   1. Comic-Con;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   2. Comic Con International;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   3.

Each of these registered trademarks is incontestable. (Doc. No. 381 at 25:15-25.) Additionally, SDCC states that it has used these Comic-Con marks extensively and continuously in interstate commerce and thus the marks have become valuable assets as well as symbols of its goodwill and positive industry reputation. (Doc. No. 1 \u00b6 15.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In early 2013, Defendant Dan Farr Productions, a limited liability company, began to advertise and promote its own popular arts convention named \"Salt Lake Comic Con\" (\"SLCC\"). (Doc. No. 234-2 at 7; Herrera Decl. Ex. 5 (\"Farr Depo.\" 11:4-9, Doc. No. 95-7).) Similar to SDCC's convention, SLCC is a three-day fan event featuring the best in movies, television shows, gaming, sci-fi, fantasy, and comic books. (Doc. No. 244 at 12.) Since 2013, SLCC has been held every year and in the beginning of 2014, Dan Farr Productions created its Salt Lake Comic Con FanXperience event, which has also been held every year since its inception. (Farr Depo. at 11:10-15; Doc. No. 97 at 11.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Thus, the marrow of this case is whether DFP's comic arts and popular fiction event named \"Salt Lake Comic Con\" infringed on SDCC's three incontestable trademarks.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   On December 8, 2017, after an eight-day jury trial, the jury found that DFP had indeed infringed on SDCC's family of service marks. (Doc. No. 395 at 2-5.) As to unfair competition and false designation of origin however, the jury found in favor of DFP. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6.) In total, the jury awarded corrective advertising damages to SDCC in the amount of $20,000.00. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Post-trial, DFP filed four motions: (1) the present matter, their motion for judgment as a matter of law, (Doc. No. 429); (2) a motion for new trial of validity and infringement, (Doc. No. 436); (3) a motion for ruling on estoppel defense, (Doc. No. 508); and (4) their motion for ruling on unclean hands defense, (Doc. No. 510).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     LEGAL STANDARD\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \"[I]n entertaining a motion for judgment as a matter of law, the court should review all of the evidence in the record.\"\n   <em>\n    Reeves v.

(Doc. No. 429-1 at 9-10.) In opposition, SDCC argues that third-party use of \"Comic-Con\" is only\n   <em>\n    infringing trademark use\n   </em>\n   , not generic use of the Comic-Con mark and that third-party infringing use does not on its own render its mark generic.

However, in reviewing the record in the light most favorable to SDCC, the evidence does not permit only one reasonable conclusion-the genericness of the phrase \"Comic Con.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Harper v.

This is especially in light of the Teflon survey produced by SDCC that established for the jury that 83% of the relevant public recognize \"Comic-Con\" as a brand name and not a common term. (Doc.

No. 382 at 22:11-13, 26:17-18, 27:5-6, 89:13-14.) DFP then surmises that as these articles consistently used \"comic con\" to refer to the type of event being offered and not to denote SDCC as the specific producer, that media usage of the phrase \"Comic Con\" supports the conclusion that the mark is generic. (Doc. No. 429-1 at 10-12.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   To contest DFP's media evidence, SDCC produced competing media usage to demonstrate the exact opposite-that \"Comic Con\" is used by the media to refer specifically to SDCC's comic convention. For instance, SDCC showed the jury television shows such as the Big Bang Theory that built story lines around attending San Diego Comic-Con. (Doc. No. 381 at 98:23-99:6.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Additionally, SDCC provided evidence of Comic-Con being featured in shows such as \"How I Met Your Mother,\" \"Chuck,\" \"OC,\" and \"American Dad.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 99:1-6.) Moreover, not only were there television shows, but SDCC also highlighted that several movies such as \"Shaun of the Dead,\" \"I Wish I was There,\" two documentaries, and Jeopardy all either took place or talked about San Diego Comic-Con. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 100:1-22.) Finally, SDCC also underscored that Conan, David Letterman, Entertainment Tonight, and Extra all did segments on San Diego Comic-Con.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 102:5-7.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   DFP attempts to detract from SDCC's abundance of media evidence by arguing that the majority of it is from sources that have a business relationship with SDCC. (Doc. No. 429-1 at 12.) Thus, this evidence does not reflect the views of the purchasing public. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Unfortunately, the Court's responsibility at this stage is not to weigh the evidence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Winarto v. Toshiba Am. Elecs.

Use of Consumer Surveys to Establish Genericide\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Under this factor, in an effort to throw out SDCC's Teflon Survey, which is unmistakably one of SDCC's most persuasive pieces of evidence, DFP yet again contends that Teflon Surveys are only appropriate where the question is whether a coined or arbitrary mark has become generic. (Doc. No. 429-1 at 14.) In support of this argument, DFP points to cases from the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board and the fourth, seventh, and eighth circuits. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The Court is perplexed that DFP has again brought these unsupported, inapplicable, and legally feckless claims-claims the Court already disposed of previously. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 253 at 10-11; Doc. No. 263 at 7-10.) Perhaps recognizing the inadequacy of these arguments, DFP's Reply Brief states that \"even if the Court determines that Ninth Circuit law differs from that of the jurisdictions cited by DFP\" their motion should be granted on other grounds. (Doc. No. 471 at 5-6.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   DFP again misses the mark. Here, DFP has the burden of persuading the Court that \"the record as a whole\" demonstrates only one thing-that Comic-Con is generic.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11101432\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/251/1222/#p1227\">\n    251 F.3d at 1227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, this string of non-dispositive case citations that contain no reference to the record are clearly frivolous arguments that only demonstrate DFP's faulty understanding of their burden in this motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   DFP then switches gears and tersely argues that the jury was presented with evidence that demonstrated that SDCC's Teflon survey is flawed. (Doc. No. 429-1 at 14-15.) Thus, the jury should have afforded little weight to the survey. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14.) Specifically, DFP is referencing Andrew Baker's testimony where he stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   A. Well, these types of studies are difficult to design. There can always be some mistakes, but the question is how many mistakes there are and how profound they are with respect to the key results that we are reporting.

SDCC's Own Use of the Trademark \"Comic-Con\"\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   DFP briefly argues that the emails between SDCC's executives demonstrates that they themselves used the term \"Comic-Con\" in a generic sense. (Doc. No. 429-1 at 13.) SDCC retorts that DFP has distorted the factual record. (Doc. No. 468 at 16.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   The statement DFP clings to is one made by Mr. Glanzer in an email: \"I think it's really important that we state, as we did at wondercon, how we are different from other shows, especially other\n   <em>\n    comic cons\n   </em>\n   .\" (Doc. No. 382 at 71:13-15 (emphasis added).) However, when questioned about the email at trial, Mr. Glanzer stated that he was not using the phrase comic con to refer to other comic conventions, but was using it to refer to \"other people who are using [SDCC's] mark.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 71:17-22.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Another email produced at trial stated: \"Interesting, Wizard has teamed with a company to provide a\n   <em>\n    comic con\n   </em>\n   channel featuring product that will be of interest to comic con fans.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 73:2-4 (emphasis added).) However, similar to the email above, when Mr. Glanzer was asked whether he was referring to fans of comic conventions, he responded that he was not, but that he was simply relating Wizard's ideas as they called themselves a comic con channel. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 73:5-10.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Thus, as a whole, though reasonable minds could differ as to the conclusions to\n   be drawn from the evidence presented, there is sufficient evidence to support the finding that SDCC's executives did not use the mark generically.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   <strong>\n    v.

Instead, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to SDCC, the Court finds that the evidence is more than sufficient to support the jury's verdict. Thus, DFP's motion for judgment as a matter of law on genericness is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pensacola Motor Sales Inc. v.

Likelihood of Confusion\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   The second half of DFP's Rule 50 motion asks that the Court enter JMOL in their favor as to likelihood of confusion. (Doc. No. 429-1 at 15-25.) In support of this assertion, DFP runs through all of the\n   <em>\n    Sleekcraft\n   </em>\n   factors. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   <strong>\n    i. Evidence Disproving Confusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   As an initial matter, DFP asserts that SDCC's failure to offer a survey showing the existence of confusion, the minimal amount of confusion evidence produced at trial, and the testimony of SDCC's own damages expert, Dr. Patrick Kennedy, affirmatively disproves confusion. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16-17.) The Court wholeheartedly disagrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   First, it is true that SDCC did not provide the jury with a likelihood of confusion survey. Second, DFP does accurately cite to a case that states \"failure to offer a survey showing the existence of confusion is evidence that the likelihood of confusion cannot be shown.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16) (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Essence Commc'n, Inc. v.

In addition to this, DFP also correctly points to two Central District of California cases that purportedly demonstrate that SDCC's lack of survey evidence \"warrants a presumption that the results would have been unfavorable.\" (Doc. No. 429-1 at 16.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   However, these arguments generate more heat than light. First, it is unquestionable that the New York District Court case mentioned above is not dispositive. Second, and most peculiarly, the two Central District of California cases do not support DFP's position. The Court notes that DFP does correctly cite to\n   <em>\n    Playboy Enters., Inc. v. Netscape Commc'ns Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11586512\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/55/1070/#p1084\">\n    55 F.Supp.2d 1070\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1084 (C.D. Cal. 1999), to argue that failure to conduct a confusion\n   survey permits the inference that the results would have been unfavorable. However, DFP turns a cold shoulder to the remainder of the case that rejects their arguments. If DFP had continued to read\n   <em>\n    Playboy Enters.\n   </em>\n   , they would have seen the court cite to\n   <em>\n    Cairns v.

Cal. 2013) (citation omitted). Thus, though a confusion survey would have been helpful, SDCC was under no obligation to provide one and DFP is incorrect in asserting that a lack of a confusion survey demonstrates that confusion is not likely.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Additionally, despite DFP's claim that SDCC only offered six instances of confusion, the record tells a much different story. (Doc. No. 429-1 at 16.) For instance, Mr. Brandenburg testified that there were \"several instances\" on social media where people confused SLCC with SDCC's Comic-Con-the incidences that he personally experienced were \"less than a hundred\" somewhere from 30-50. (Doc. No. 383 at 83:10-13; 118:22-119:2.) Additionally, the record demonstrates that Mr. Brandenburg received correspondence from consumers asking if SLCC was affiliated with San Diego, (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 85:1-4), and Ms. Follet testified that she was aware of confusion by vendors, exhibitors, attendees, reporters, and others, (Doc.

DFP then resorts to picking apart Mr. Kennedy's statements made at trial. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) However, this personal reflection of Mr. Kennedy's testimony again ignores the \"bedrock principles delineating the trial judge's limited role in reviewing a jury's factual findings,\"\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11101432\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/251/1222/#p1227\">\n    251 F.3d at 1227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , which requires a court to only review a jury's verdict for substantial evidence and does not allow a court to make any credibility determinations,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Amor Ministries v.

(Tr. Exs. 35, 36, 38, 370, 372, 643, 645, Doc. No. 392.) In addition, despite DFP's assertions that SDCC commingled the mark with its other marks, the record demonstrates an entirely different state of affairs. For instance, SDCC provided a documentary called \"Comic-Con Episode IV,\" articles entitled \"Star Trek: Discovery Reveals Exciting Comic-Con Plans[,]\" \"At Comic-Con, Bring Out Your Fantasy and Fuel the Culture,\" and \"On Dipping an Introverted Toe in the Comic-Con Ocean.\" (Tr.

Similarity of Services\n    </em>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   It is unquestionable that the services provided and events produced by SDCC and DFP are almost mirror reflections of each other. SDCC is a non-profit education corporation \"dedicated to celebrating and promoting comics and the popular arts.\" (Doc. No. 381 at 17:4-7.) SDCC's main event is its Comic-Con Convention that takes over San Diego for four-days\n   every July and draws famous actors to speak at panels, premieres major motion pictures, and allows fans to meet and congregate. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19:18-20:25.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   At trial, DFP highlighted some unique aspects of their event-that SLCC is Mormon and family-friendly, that SLCC has a kid-friendly event called \"Kid Con,\" and that DFP has a strong relationship with the U.S. Air Force. (Doc. No. 383 at 35:15-22, 36:12-19, 37:10-13.) These miniscule differences, however, do not detract from the overwhelming similarities that exist between SLCC and San Diego Comic-Con. In fact, DFP's motion does not attempt to contest this fact.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Instead, seeking to challenge the parallels between the two events at issue, DFP points the Court to\n   <em>\n    Entrepreneur Media, Inc. v.

(Doc. No. 429-1 at 20.) However, DFP torpedoes their own claim as SDCC's trademarks are \"incontestable\" and not descriptive. Moreover, the mark at issue in\n   <em>\n    Entrepreneur\n   </em>\n   , was \"Entrepreneur.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9398690\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/279/1135/#p1147\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9398690\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/279/1135/#p1147\">\n    at 1138\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, in making the conclusion that similarity of services is afforded little weight when a mark is descriptive, the court was focusing on specific policy concerns such as the \"broad societal interest in preserving common, useful words for the public domain.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9398690\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/279/1135/#p1147\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9398690\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/279/1135/#p1147\">\n    at 1148\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Presently, the mark \"Comic-Con\" is not a common or straightforward phrase.

Instead, according to SDCC, DFP also used traditional media, as well as billboards, both stationary and mobile. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Additionally, SDCC puts great emphasis on the fact that DFP brought an Audi R8 sports car to SDCC's event to serve as a mobile billboard.

In this case, DFP has failed to show that the only reasonable conclusion permitted by the evidence on the record is that there is no likelihood of confusion between their \"Salt Lake Comic Con\" mark and SDCC's \"Comic-Con\" mark. Accordingly, DFP's motion for judgment as a matter of law as to likelihood of confusion in this respect is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Krechman v.

Likelihood of Confusion as to SDCC's Two Other Trademarks\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   DFP also argues that there is not enough evidence on the record to support the jury's finding that their \"Salt Lake Comic Con\" mark infringes SDCC's Comic Con International trademark and eye logo mark. (Doc. No. 429-1 at 24-25.) To support these arguments, DFP points to similar contentions already discussed at length by the Court in this Order. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) SDCC contends that as each of its two other marks use the phrase \"comic con,\" that the jury was entitled to give greater weight to this dominant feature in determining likelihood of confusion. (Doc. No. 468 at 25-26.) The Court agrees with SDCC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   The Court finds that it need not reiterate its exhaustive analysis of the\n   <em>\n    Sleekcraft\n   </em>\n   factors delineated in the foregoing eight pages. Instead, the Court finds that the analysis applied above equally applies to\n   the two trademarks here. For clarity, however, the Court expounds the most vital points. Here, as to both of SDCC's other trademarks, there is the presumption of the strength of the marks as they are incontestable, the events remain identical, the similarity of the marks remains elevated as they all employ \"Comic Con,\" SDCC produced substantial amounts of evidence of actual confusion, and SDCC introduced evidence that DFP intended to select SDCC's marks knowing that they were registered with the United States Patent and Trademark Office.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   Consequently, reviewing the record as a whole, the Court finds that there is a legally sufficient basis for a reasonable jury to find for SDCC as to likelihood of confusion in relation to these two trademarks.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Jorgensen v.

Thus, DFP's motion for judgment as a matter of law as to likelihood of confusion in regards to SDCC's Comic Con International and Eye Logo trademarks is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   DFP as the moving party, had an extremely \"high hurdle\" to meet on their motion for judgment as a matter of law.\n   <em>\n    Costa\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11451704\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/299/838/#p859\">\n    299 F.3d at 859\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Unfortunately, proceeding under a flawed misunderstanding of their burden and the Court's limited review process, and construing the evidence in the light most favorable to SDCC, there is substantial evidence to support the jury's verdict in regards to genericness and likelihood of confusion.
