The motion is fully briefed and is ripe for decision. The government does not oppose the motion, but defers to the \"sound discretion\" of the court as to whether further inquiry into the facts is necessary. (ECF No. 24 at 3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   I.\n   <em>\n    BACKGROUND &amp; PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Clark is a citizen of Pennsylvania (ECF No. 22 at 2). He was a combat engineer in the United States Army, specializing in explosives involving mines and traps, and received an honorable discharge (ECF No. 25-1 at 34). For the past nineteen years, he has been employed as a corrections officer at the State Correctional Institution, Mercer (ECF No. 22 at 3). He wishes to possess firearms for self-defense and for the defense of his family.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On May 26, 2002, Clark was convicted under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20Pa.%20Cons.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%206106\">\n    18 Pa. Cons. Stat. \u00a7 6106\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2) for carrying a firearm without a license (ECF No. 22 at 3). He was sentenced to one year of probation and a fine of two-hundred and forty-two dollars. Although classified as a misdemeanor under Pennsylvania law, Clark's conviction under \u00a7 6106(a)(2) provided for a maximum sentence of five years of imprisonment. 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. 106(b)(6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Federal law prohibits the possession of firearms by any person convicted of \"a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20922\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g). Because of his 2002 conviction, therefore, Clark is unable to possess a firearm. Violation of \u00a7 922(g)(1) is a felony criminal offense punishable by fine and imprisonment of up to ten years.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Clark's 2002 conviction arose from an altercation with Beth Carvella (\"Carvella\"), his then-girlfriend, outside her place of work on September 27, 2001. According to the criminal complaint, an unnamed witness stated that \"the defendant held the loaded gun to his own head.\" (ECF No. 25-1 at 40). Clark was charged with reckless endangerment in violation of 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 2705,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   but the charge was withdrawn. (ECF No. 21-3 at 10). Clark denied holding the gun to his head and testified that he took the firearm out of his waistband only to put it away in his truck in order to follow his then-girlfriend into the diner where she worked. (ECF No. 25-1 at 16-17). Following the arrest, Clark underwent a psychological evaluation by Dr. Meyer that was unremarkable: it was determined that he was \"fit for duty\" (ECF No. 25-1 at 34-37). Carvella told Dr. Meyer that \"at no time was she intimidated or felt that her life was in danger.\" (ECF No. 25-1 at 35).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Clark purchased the firearm in question \"sometime between September 1996 and March 1997\" with the intent to carry it for protection\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (ECF No. 24 at 7; ECF No. 25-1 at 6). Despite this, he claims he \"didn't start carrying it until ... two weeks before\" the date of the crime for which he was convicted because the events on September 11, 2001 troubled him (ECF No. 24 at 7; ECF No. 25-1 at 6). He also purchased a holster on \"[p]robably the same day that [he] bought the handgun\" (ECF No. 24 at 8; ECF No. 25-1 at 20). Carvella asserted that \"the gun is taken whenever they travel,\" but Clark explained he \"would just leave it in [his] truck\" and \"never wore\" the holster (ECF No. 24 at 8; ECF No. 25-1 at 11).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Clark asserts that he has remained \"law-abiding\" since his 2002 conviction.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The government disagrees, and contends that: \"the legal conclusion that Mr. Clark is 'law-abiding' is a fact, material or otherwise, subject to determination through a statement of material facts.\" (ECF No. 23 \u00b6 6; ECF No. 25 \u00b6\u00b6 6, 8). The government presents one incident at Clark's work as evidence of less than law-abiding behavior that, in the government's view, should preclude him from possession of a firearm. About \"a year and a half ago,\" Clark was disciplined with a \"five-day suspension\" for \"insubordination\" (ECF No. 24 at 8; ECF No. 25-1 at 24-26). Clark testified that a female lieutenant confronted him while he was taking \"two hamburgers from the inmate dining hall ... [to] give ... to [an] inmate for fixing [his] coat\" (ECF No. 24 at 9; ECF No. 25-1 at 24-26). After she intervened, he \"dropped them on the floor and walked away.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Clark concluded that she \"had something personal against\" him and is \"a bitter, bitter person\" despite having never before interacted with her.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   II.\n   <em>\n    STANDARD FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Summary judgment is appropriate where the moving party establishes \"that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact\" and judgment is appropriate \"as a matter of law.\" Fed.

Here, the government presented only the circumstances surrounding Clark's 2002 conviction and a recent work-related incident as evidence of his potential to commit crimes in the future. The fact that the 2002 conviction stemmed from an argument is potentially troublesome. Citizens who turn to violence following arguments would present a clear danger to the community. There is no evidence, however, that Clark used the firearm threateningly in 2002. Clark testified, without dispute, he was simply putting it away in his truck before following his girlfriend into the restaurant to continue the verbal argument. He made a conscious, responsible decision to put the gun in safekeeping despite being in the midst of an argument. Following the incident, Carvella still described Clark as her \"best friend\" and told Dr. Meyer that she never felt endangered during the incident. (ECF No. 25-1 at 35). Dr. Meyer opined that Clark was fit for duty and did not present a significant danger to others. (ECF No. 25-1 at 36). The couple broke up about a year after the incident, but Clark has since married and had no issues of domestic violence. The government offered no contrary evidence.\n    <footnotemark>\n     9\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-57\">\n    The length of time between Clark's conviction and the filing of this action in 2018 is significant. He has had no encounters with law enforcement since September 2001. In\n    <em>\n     Binderup\n    </em>\n    , Judge Ambro discounted the government's estimate of the likelihood of recidivism because Binderup's and Suarez's offenses were, respectively, 20 and 26 years old.\n    <em>\n     Binderup\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4354472\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/836/336/\">\n     836 F.3d at 353-54\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .
