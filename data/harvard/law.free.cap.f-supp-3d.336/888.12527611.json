After being named as a defendant in this lawsuit, Valley Asphalt filed a \u00a7 113(f) counterclaim, seeking contribution from Plaintiffs for costs incurred in connection with that UAO.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   In its August 29, 2017, Decision and Entry, the Court noted that Valley Asphalt's property is within the boundaries of the Site, and the 2013 ASAOC required Plaintiffs to do this same work Site-wide, Because this was a matter addressed in the ASAOC, Plaintiffs were entitled to contribution protection, under \u00a7 113(f)(2), for vapor testing and mitigation efforts on Valley Asphalt's property. The Court held that, to the extent that Valley Asphalt sought contribution from Plaintiffs under \u00a7 113(f), the Counterclaim was devoid of factual allegations giving rise to an inference that any of the response costs stemming from the UAO were outside the scope of Plaintiffs' contribution protection.

As discussed above, the Sixth Circuit has held that \"PRPs must proceed under \u00a7 113(f) if they meet one of that section's statutory triggers.\"\n   <em>\n    Hobart\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4158322\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/758/757/#p762\">\n    758 F.3d at 767\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Those\n   \"statutory triggers\" are set forth in \u00a7\u00a7 113(f)(1) and (f)(3)(B).

The Court will discuss each of these in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Section 106\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Citing\n   <em>\n    Centerior Service Co. v.

As in\n   <em>\n    Centerior\n   </em>\n   , Valley Asphalt, a PRP, incurred response costs pursuant to a UAO and now seeks to recover those costs from other PRPs, including Plaintiffs. Accordingly, if\n   <em>\n    Centerior\n   </em>\n   is still good law, Valley Asphalt would be entitled to bring a \u00a7 113(f)(1) claim for contribution, and would be precluded from bringing a cost recovery claim under \u00a7 107(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Valley Asphalt, however, argues that\n   <em>\n    Centerior\n   </em>\n   is no longer good law.

The elements of a \u00a7 113(f) contribution claim, and the relevant defenses, are based on the requirements set forth in \u00a7 107(a).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    ITT Indus.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6046932\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/506/452/#p457\">\n    506 F.3d at 458\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Equitable Considerations\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Valley Asphalt argues that this outcome is unfair because, even though it is\n   <em>\n    eligible\n   </em>\n   to bring a \u00a7 113(f) counterclaim against Plaintiffs,\n   <em>\n    recovery\n   </em>\n   is barred by virtue of the contribution protections provided to Plaintiffs in the ASAOCs. Valley Asphalt maintains that, under the circumstances presented here, the Court should allow it to pursue a cost recovery claim against Plaintiffs under \u00a7 107(a). The Court disagrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Although Valley Asphalt cannot\n   <em>\n    recover\n   </em>\n   from Plaintiffs under \u00a7 113(f), this does not justify allowing Valley Asphalt to pursue a \u00a7 107(a) cost recovery counterclaim against them. The fact that Valley Asphalt is left without a viable remedy against Plaintiffs,\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   and that Valley Asphalt and other defendants may have to shoulder a disproportionate share of costs associated with the UAO, is of little or no legal import.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Plaintiffs have taken responsibility for the cleanup of the Site and have settled their claims with the EPA. Their actions fulfill CERCLA's goal of promoting timely cleanup of hazardous waste sites.\n   <em>\n    Kalamazoo River Study Grp. v. Menasha Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11228345\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/228/648/#p657\">\n    228 F.3d 648\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 657 (6th Cir. 2000). To allow Valley Asphalt to now pursue a \u00a7 107(a) cost recovery counterclaim against Plaintiffs would discourage settlement. As previously noted, under \u00a7 113(f), a PRP is liable only for its equitable share of the cleanup costs. In contrast, under \u00a7 107(a), PRPs are jointly and severally liable. To subject Plaintiffs to joint and several liability for the costs that Valley Asphalt incurred pursuant to the UAO would be unfair, given that Plaintiffs have only a \u00a7 113(f) claim against Valley Asphalt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   <strong>\n    4. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Given that Valley Asphalt has satisfied at least one of the statutory triggers for bringing a contribution action under \u00a7 113(f), it cannot bring a cost recovery claim under \u00a7 107(a). The fact that Valley Asphalt will not be able to recover from Plaintiffs on the \u00a7 113(f) counterclaim does not warrant a different result. Accordingly, to the extent that Valley Asphalt seeks cost recovery against Plaintiffs under \u00a7 107(a), it has failed to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. The Court therefore SUSTAINS Plaintiffs' motion to dismiss this portion of the Amended Counterclaim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Costs of Identifying Other Potentially Responsible Parties\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   In its August 29, 2017, Decision and Entry, the Court held that Plaintiffs are not entitled to contribution protection for the cost of identifying other PRPs, because these costs fall outside the scope of the work required by the ASAOCs. Accordingly, it allowed Defendants to proceed on these particular counterclaims for contribution. Doc. # 774, PageID## 21313-14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Valley Asphalt has reasserted this counterclaim in paragraph 9 of its Amended Counterclaim. Plaintiffs argue that the counterclaim is insufficiently pled because Valley Asphalt does not allege that it has\n   incurred any costs of identifying other PRPs. It simply alleges that, if it is adjudged liable for such costs, it is entitled to contribution from Plaintiffs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   This, however, is no different than the counterclaims asserted by numerous other Defendants in this case. For the reasons set forth in the August 29, 2017, Decision and Entry, the Court OVERRULES Plaintiffs' motion to dismiss this portion of Valley Asphalt's Amended Counterclaim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   <strong>\n    V. Plaintiffs' Motion to Dismiss Defendant The Dayton Power &amp; Light Company's Amended Counterclaim (Doc. # 798)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Before turning to the merits of Plaintiffs' Motion to Dismiss Defendant DP &amp; L's Amended Counterclaim, a brief recap of the procedural history of this claim is warranted. DP &amp; L previously sought contribution and/or indemnification from Plaintiffs under \u00a7\u00a7 107(a)(4)(B) and 113(f)(1) for costs it voluntarily incurred in connection with contamination at the Site. Doc. # 437, PageID## 6507-08. Plaintiffs moved to dismiss the counterclaims, arguing that they were entitled to contribution protection on the \u00a7 113(f) claims, and that DP &amp; L's allegations on the \u00a7 107(a) claim were not specific enough to be able to determine whether any of the costs incurred fell outside the scope of contribution protection. Doc. # 473.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   In response, DP &amp; L argued that its \u00a7 107(a) counterclaim was not precluded by Plaintiffs' alleged \u00a7 113(f) contribution protection.

DP &amp; L argues that, because the Court has dismissed Plaintiffs' \u00a7 107(a) claim, there is no \"civil action ... under section [107(a) ] of this title\" to trigger DP &amp; L's right to bring a \u00a7 113(f) counterclaim for contribution. DP &amp; L maintains that, because that statutory trigger has not been met, it is entitled to bring a \u00a7 107(a) counterclaim for cost recovery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   The Court rejects this argument. As discussed in connection with Valley Asphalt's Amended Counterclaim, the language \"during or following any civil action under section 107(a)\" must be interpreted to include civil actions under \u00a7 113(f) because, as Plaintiffs note, in order to recover on a \u00a7 113(f) claim for contribution, they must first prove that Defendants are liable or potentially liable under \u00a7 107(a).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kalamazoo River Study Group v.
