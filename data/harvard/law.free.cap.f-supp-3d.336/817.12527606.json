These motions were filed by Austin Woods on July 18, 2018. On August 3, 2018, Antoine Woods filed a Motion to Adopt Pleadings Filed on Behalf of Co-Defendant Austin Woods (Dkt. # 124), which the Court will construe as a notice of joinder, relying on the arguments presented in Austin Woods's motions. The Government filed responses on August 10, 2018.

The Government responds that Defendants' argument is irrelevant in this case because the charged \u00a7 924(c) counts are predicated on crimes that fall within the \"elements clause\" contained in \u00a7 924(c)(3)(A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In their second motion, Defendants argue that, given the Supreme Court's recent decision in\n   <em>\n    Carpenter v.

BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On September 6, 2017, Defendants were indicted in a First Superseding Indictment. (Dkt. # 41). After Defendant Austin Woods filed the instant motions, a federal grand jury returned a Second Superseding Indictment, which adds two new charges and one new defendant. (Dkt. # 126, filed on August 8, 2018). However, Counts One through Fifteen remain the same across both indictments, and the filing of the new indictment has no bearing on resolving the instant motions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Defendant Antoine Woods is charged with: Conspiracy to Commit Murder in Aid of Racketeering (Count One); Conspiracy to Commit Assault with a Dangerous Weapon in Aid of Racketeering (Count Two); Attempted Murder in Aid of Racketeering (Counts Three, Six, Nine, and Twelve); Assault with a Dangerous Weapon in Aid of Racketeering (Counts Four, Seven, Ten, and Thirteen); Using, Carrying, and Discharging a Firearm During and in Relation to a Crime of Violence (Counts Five, Eight, Eleven, and Fourteen); Conspiracy to Commit Obstruction of Justice (Count Sixteen); and Obstruction of Justice (Count Seventeen).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Defendant Austin Woods is charged with: Conspiracy to Commit Murder in Aid of Racketeering (Count One); Conspiracy to Commit Assault with a Dangerous Weapon in Aid of Racketeering (Count Two); and Using, Carrying, and Discharging a Firearm During and in Relation to a Crime of Violence (Counts Five, Eight, Eleven, and Fourteen).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The allegations against Defendants concern a murder conspiracy and four separate shootings in the Eastern District of Michigan, Southern Division from October 2015 through March 2016 by members of the Detroit street gang Head Niggas in Charge, or HNIC. According to the Government, the shootings were aimed at a rival who had embarrassed Defendants in an incident that was captured on social media. Antoine Woods is alleged to have taken a lead role in the shootings, which were aimed at the rival and members of the rival's family, while Austin Woods is alleged to have supported and facilitated the shootings. The shootings allegedly took place outside a crowded strip club, at a busy hair salon, and twice at the rival's grandmother's house in the middle of the night.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Mich. Aug. 2, 2018).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   In this case, law enforcement relied on the SCA and binding Sixth Circuit precedent. At the time that the Government applied for and obtained the \u00a7 2703(d) disclosure orders at issue, the Supreme Court had not even granted certiorari in\n   <em>\n    Carpenter\n   </em>\n   . The Court concludes that the good-faith exception to the exclusionary rule applies in this case, and the Court denies Defendants' motion to suppress the CSLI records.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   At oral argument, Defendants raised a new argument that the good-faith exception to the exclusionary rule cannot rescue the Government's \u00a7 2703(d) applications in this case because they are \"bare bones\" and fail to meet even the less than probable cause standard articulated in the SCA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. West\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3701655\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/520/604/#p610\">\n    520 F.3d 604\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 610 (6th Cir. 2008) (\"The\n   <em>\n    Leon\n   </em>\n   good faith exception does not apply to rescue a warrant issued on the basis of a 'bare bones' affidavit.\") (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). Again, prior to\n   <em>\n    Carpenter\n   </em>\n   , \u00a7 2703(d) of the SCA required the Government to offer specific and articulable facts in their applications showing that there were reasonable grounds to believe that the CSLI records sought were relevant and material to an ongoing criminal investigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   As noted above, following oral argument, Defendants filed the applications at issue under seal, and the Court has reviewed them. The Government's March 28, 2017 applications explain that the Government is investigating criminal activities of the members and associates of HNIC, a criminal street gang, and list several suspected federal criminal violations. The applications state that officers have reviewed hundreds of police reports and conducted dozens of interviews with confidential informant, lay witnesses, and officers with personal knowledge about HNIC-related conduct. According to the applications, officers have also served several federal search warrants leading to the seizure of relevant digital and physical evidence, including firearms; have performed forensic analyses of numerous electronic medica; and have conducted surveillance. The applications go on to state that the investigation has revealed that HNIC is a violent criminal enterprise operating primarily in northwest Detroit whose members are involved in armed robberies, assaults, fatal and non-fatal shootings, armed narcotics trafficking, identity theft, and the manufacturing and possession of fraudulent financial transaction devices. Based on the investigation, ATF officers have identified a set of HNIC members and associates, which the applications list by name and corresponding cell phone numbers, who may have been involved in one or more of a list of criminal events on behalf of or in connection with HNIC, or a witness thereto. The list of criminal events include fatal and non-fatal shootings identified by month, year, and location. The applications state that subscriber records, call log records, and cell tower connection records would enable officers to potentially corroborate victim and witness statements, identify or eliminate individuals as suspects, and/or evaluate the individuals' relationships with each other and HNIC. The Government's May 8, 2017 application contains the same information as well as additional information about Defendant Antoine Woods, a.k.a. \"HNIC Pesh.\" The application explains that Antoine Woods is known to be associated with HNIC, and that pictures and text messages found on a cell phone seized from him in April 2017 indicate that he was targeting a rival gang member in the fall of 2015. According to the application, the rival and his family were victims of several shootings in that\n   time frame, each identified by month, year, and location.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   The Court concludes that each application satisfies the \u00a7 2703(d) standard of offering specific and articulable facts showing that there were reasonable grounds to believe that the CSLI records sought were relevant and material to an ongoing criminal investigation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pembrook\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12265836\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/876/812/#p823\">\n    876 F.3d at 823-24\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (facts provided were sufficient to meet the \u00a7 2703(d) statutory standard where the application briefly informed the magistrate judge about two robberies in different locations and their similarities; explained that surveillance video from the two stores supported the suspicion that the same robbers committed both robberies; and concluded that cell tower information in the two locations may reveal a common cell phone number that was active at each location around the time of the crime, identification of which would aid in identifying potential suspects) (judgment vacated on other grounds). Defendants' motion to suppress the CSLI records on this basis is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <strong>\n    III.
