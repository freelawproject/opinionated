Compl.\"), against Defendants the Town of Southeast (the \"Town\"), Tony Hay, and Michael Bruen (collectively, \"Defendants\"). The Amended Complaint asserts various causes of action, including retaliation in violation of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20621\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 621\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   (the \"ADEA\"), pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , violations of his Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment rights to equal protection and procedural and substantive due process, malicious prosecution in violation of the Fourth Amendment, and retaliation in violation of the First Amendment, as well as several pendent state law claims. Presently before the Court is the Defendants' motion for summary judgment pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56 (the \"Defendants' Motion\"). For the following reasons, Defendants' Motion is GRANTED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The following facts are taken from the Amended Complaint, Defendant's Rule 56.1 Statement of Undisputed Material Facts (\"Def. 56.1\") (ECF No. 36), Plaintiff's Rule 56.1 Statement of Undisputed Material Facts (\"Plf. Resp.\") (ECF No. 40), Defendant's Counter Response to Plaintiff's 56.1 Statement (\"Def. Cntr.\") (ECF No. 44), and are uncontested except where indicated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff was employed as a Road Maintenance Equipment Operator (\"RMEO\") in the Town's Highway Department for over eleven years. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Plf. Resp. \u00b6\u00b6 2, 3.) As an RMEO, Plaintiff was required to perform\n   inspections on the equipment and vehicles he operated prior to their use. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 25; Declaration of James A. Randazzo in Support of Defendants' Motion (\"Randazzo Decl.\") (ECF No. 38), Ex. C at 50-54; Ex. F at 76-78.) After performing such inspections, Plaintiff and other employees like him were required to complete a pre-trip inspection form, and if they perceived any safety issues, they were required to inform the mechanic immediately. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Plf. Resp. \u00b6 25; Randazzo Decl., Ex. F at 76-78.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   At the time of the Defendants' alleged unlawful conduct, Plaintiff was 32 years old. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Plf. Resp. \u00b6 1; Am. Compl. \u00b6 5.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In January of 2015, following an incident between Plaintiff and Defendant Bruen, Plaintiff was suspended without pay, pending charges pursuant to Civil Service Law \u00a7 75. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Plf. Resp. \u00b6\u00b6 30-42.) Disciplinary charges were issued on February 4, 2015 and a disciplinary hearing presided over by William Wallens (the \"Hearing Officer\") followed (the \" Section 75 Hearing\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 51-55.) Following the Section 75 Hearing, the Town Board voted to terminate Plaintiff. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 68.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Defendant Hay is the Supervisor of the Town and was in that position during the time relevant to Plaintiff's Amended Complaint. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Plf. Resp. \u00b6 4.) Defendant Bruen serves as the Highway Superintendent for the Town and has been in that position since approximately November 18, 2013. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 6; Am. Compl. \u00b6 32; Randazzo Decl., Ex. F at 38.) Plaintiff contends that after Bruen became the Highway Superintendent, he began to engage in a course of conduct which constituted harassment, discrimination, retaliation, and a hostile work environment, with the alleged acquiescence and approval of Hay. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl. \u00b6 32.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In July of 2012, over a year before Bruen became Highway Superintendent, Plaintiff entered into a stipulation of settlement with the Town whereby he agreed to a disciplinary suspension of five days without pay in resolution of three allegations of misconduct.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Plf. Resp. \u00b6 8;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Randazzo Decl., Ex. N at Town Ex. 11.) In September of that year, Plaintiff applied to the position of Assistant Mechanic, but he was not chosen and the position was not filled. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Plf. Resp. \u00b6 10.) The position was offered again in December of 2013 and Plaintiff applied, but again was not chosen for the position. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 12-13.) In April of 2014, Plaintiff applied to the position of Construction Equipment Operator, but Bruen hired another individual to fill the position that December. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 14-15.) The individuals chosen for each position were older than Plaintiff. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 16.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In 2014, Plaintiff received five Letters of Counseling and/or Reprimand. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Plf. Resp. \u00b6\u00b6 18-24.) In March and April, he received Letters of Reprimand for insubordination. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 18-19.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   In May, Plaintiff\n   received a Letter of Counseling for insubordination and was advised that further acts of insubordination would result in disciplinary action. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20.) In June, Plaintiff received a second Letter of Counseling for missing work without prior approval for two days in May. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 21-24.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   This Letter of Counseling also contained an advisement that further similar conduct would lead to disciplinary action. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 24.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In the summer of 2014, Plaintiff was instructed to operate a 10-wheeler truck. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 27.) The operation of such a truck was within Plaintiff's job description. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 26.) After performing an inspection on the truck, Plaintiff complained to the mechanic on the job, Michael Burdick, that he would not drive the truck because it had bald tires.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Plf. Resp. \u00b6 27; Randazzo Decl., C at 49-50; Ex. D at 211-215.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On January 9, 2015, Plaintiff filed a complaint with the New York State Division of Human Rights (\"NYSDHR\") which was dually filed with the United States Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\"EEOC\") alleging,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , that he was discriminated against on the basis of his age when he was denied the promotions in December 2013 and April of 2014. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Plf. Resp. \u00b6\u00b6 28-29.) Thereafter, Bruen asked Plaintiff if he had filed the complaint, if he was \"aware of what it was doing to the morale\" of the department, and said that the complaint was \"bringing down everything [Bruen] felt [they] had accomplished\" in the department. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs. Cntr. \u00b6\u00b6 84-85.) Plaintiff also contends that, at some unidentified time, Bruen referred to him as \"a young mistaken boy.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 91.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff amended his discrimination charge on June 30, 2015 to include retaliation, discrimination, and a hostile work environment. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Plf. Resp. \u00b6 58.) By determination and order dated July 1, 2015, following an investigation, the NYSDHR held there was no probable cause to believe that Defendants engaged in the alleged discriminatory practices. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 59.) The EEOC adopted the findings of the NYSDHR on August 19, 2015, dismissed Plaintiff's complaint, and issued a notice of right to sue. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 60.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On January 15, 2015, Plaintiff removed firewood from the Highway Department for his personal use without permission. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Plf. Resp. \u00b6\u00b6 30, 66; Randazzo Decl., Ex. O at 60-61.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   The following day at a morning meeting, Bruen reminded the employees that department policy required them to receive permission before removing any materials from the department. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Plf. Resp. \u00b6 31.) Following the reminder, Plaintiff glared at Bruen threateningly, became irate, and started swearing in the lunchroom in the presence of the other employees. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Randazzo Decl., Ex. O at 62.) At the conclusion of the meeting, Bruen asked to speak to Plaintiff in his office. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Plf. Resp. \u00b6 34; Randazzo Decl., Ex. O at 62.) Plaintiff did not respond and proceeded out of the building; Bruen followed. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Randazzo Decl., Ex. O at 62.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Bruen again told Plaintiff he wanted to see him and his shop steward in his office immediately, and Plaintiff responded that he \"would have the meeting right then and there\" in the shop. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Bruen again informed Plaintiff that the meeting would occur in his office. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) As the two were walking toward Bruen's office, Plaintiff behind Bruen, Plaintiff reiterated that he wanted to have the meeting in the shop, causing Bruen to turn around. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiff continued walking toward Bruen and bumped into him, making physical contact. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Bruen then asked Plaintiff if he was trying to walk through him and Plaintiff responded, \"whatever it takes.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) During the meeting in Bruen's office, Plaintiff used foul and abusive language and spoke in an inappropriate manner. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Following the incident, Plaintiff went home. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Plf. Resp. \u00b6 41.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On January 22, 2015, Plaintiff was suspended without pay pending forthcoming disciplinary charges. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 42.) The same day, Bruen gave a sworn statement to the Putnam County Sheriff's Department regarding the incident on January 16, 2015. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 44.) As a result, Plaintiff was served with a criminal summons for harassment in the second degree, dated February 3, 2015. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 47.) Plaintiff was not arrested, but did have to appear in court on two occasions. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 48-49.) Plaintiff did not have to post bail and no travel restrictions were imposed on him. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 50.) The criminal summons against Plaintiff was ultimately dismissed. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 71.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On February 4, 2015, Plaintiff was served with the Section 75 disciplinary charges. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 51.) Twelve charges, including,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , insubordination, absence without leave, and dereliction of duty were asserted. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Randazzo Decl., Ex. L.) The Section 75 Hearing was held on February 27, 2015, March 9, 2015, and August 20, 2015 to assess whether the charges were meritorious and warranted termination. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 54-56.) Plaintiff was present at the hearing, represented by counsel, and provided the opportunity to enter evidence, cross examine the Town's witnesses, offer testimony of his own witnesses, and testify on his own behalf. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 56-57; Randazzo Decl., Ex. M, Ex. O at 1-2, 44-46.) The Hearing Officer issued a report and recommendation regarding the charges on December 8, 2015. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Randazzo Decl., Ex. O at 65.) The Hearing Officer found Plaintiff guilty on charges 4, 5, 6, 8, 11, and 12, dismissed the others, and recommended termination. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Plf. Resp. \u00b6 61; Defs. Cntr. \u00b6 87; Randazzo Decl., Ex. O at 48-64.) On December 11, 2015, the Town Board voted to accept and adopt the Hearing Officer's report and recommendation and terminated Plaintiff's employment. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Plf. Resp. \u00b6 68.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Summary judgment is appropriate \"if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed.

Moreover, the crux of Plaintiff's beliefs that he was discriminated against on the basis of age appear to rest on the following facts: (1) the two promotions he applied to (in December 2012 and April 2014) were given to older employees;\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   (2) Bruen allegedly\n   called him a \"young mistaken boy\"; and (3) that he was the \"youngest employee of the Town's Highway Department in November 2013.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Randazzo Decl., Ex.

Considering that theory in light of the remainder of the evidence, it would strain credulity to hold that Plaintiff had a reasonable belief that the ADEA was being violated. Plaintiff's claim that he was denied two promotions because of Bruen's discriminatory behavior is untenable. The one in December of 2013 was also offered before Bruen was Superintendent and not given to Plaintiff. Additionally, the mere assertion that he was denied the April 2014 promotion because of his age, particularly where others applied to the position (one of whom was his age, (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Plf.

That is not the precise issue raised by Defendants. Moreover, Plaintiff cites\n    <em>\n     Deravin\n    </em>\n    for the proposition that \"good faith\" is not required and retaliation can stand regardless of whether \"the allegations are valid or reasonable.\" (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Plf.

To the contrary, though the underlying discrimination claim need not be successful, a plaintiff alleging a stand-alone retaliation claim under the ADEA, much like that of the ADA or Title VII,\n    <em>\n     must\n    </em>\n    have had a good faith, reasonable belief that the substantive statute was being violated.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Kessler v.

(\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Defs. Cntr. \u00b6 92.) The Court need not deny summary judgment on this ground, because, even assuming Bruen did call Plaintiff a \"young mistaken boy\", it is insufficient to convince this Court that Plaintiff had a reasonable belief that he was being targeted for his age.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"13\">\n   <p id=\"p-86\">\n    Defendants construe Plaintiff's First Amendment claim as concerning three incidents of alleged protected speech: (1) his complaints about the bald tires; (2) filing grievances with his union; and (3) filing a complaint with the NYSDHR. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Defs. Br. at 7.) The First Amendment claim as alleged in the Amended Complaint, however, appears to only concern the complaints regarding his concerns that the bald tires were dangerous. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Am. Compl. 117-27.) Plaintiff's Opposition fails to articulate what speech he is claiming is protected by the First Amendment. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Plf. Br. at 8-10.) The Court concludes that, based on the Amended Complaint, Plaintiff's purported protected speech pertained to the complaints about the bald tires only. Nevertheless, it will also briefly address the remaining instances of alleged speech.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"14\">\n   <p id=\"p-87\">\n    Plaintiff's contention that he disputes \"that the cited references stand for the fact asserted\" in paragraph 25 of Defendants' 56.1 fails to raise a material issue of fact, and is plainly incorrect. Plaintiff explicitly testified in his hearing pursuant to\n    <extracted-citation index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20Gen.%20Mun.%20L.%20%C2%A7%2050\">\n     N.Y. Gen. Mun. L. \u00a7 50\n    </extracted-citation>\n    -h that prior to using the vehicle, the employees \"were supposed to\" submit a pre-trip inspection form \"every day\", (\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    Randazzo Decl., Ex. C at 54), and Bruen testified that operators were required to perform a safety inspection and report any issues to the mechanics before operating the vehicles, (\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    Randazzo Decl., Ex. F at 76-78.) Consequently, the evidence does support Defendants' contention that Plaintiff \"was required to inspect any Town vehicles that he would be using.\" (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Def. 56.1 \u00b6 25.) A flat assertion that they do not does not raise a triable issue of fact. Plaintiff cannot fabricate issues of fact to defeat summary judgment.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"15\">\n   <p id=\"p-88\">\n    Plaintiff's counsel completely ignores this binding Second Circuit precedent, despite an obligation to advise the Court of unfavorable binding precedent. Instead, Plaintiff relies on cases from 1997 and 1998 to support his arguments and cherry picks favorable portions of those decisions to make a disingenuous argument, thereby disregarding the propositions for which those cases stand.\n    <em>\n     Sassower\n    </em>\n    and\n    <em>\n     Willner\n    </em>\n    relied on\n    <em>\n     Murphy\n    </em>\n    for the proposition that\n    <em>\n     post-arraignment\n    </em>\n    court appearances, alone, are sufficient for a Fourth Amendment liberty violation.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Sassower v.

Though neither case explicitly stated that its holding pertained only to post-arraignment court appearances, both discussed\n    <em>\n     Murphy\n    </em>\n    at length and indeed were merely interpreting\n    <em>\n     Murphy\n    </em>\n    (which pertained only to post-arraignment seizures) to ascertain its true holding.\n    <em>\n     Sassower\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"247846\" index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/992/652/#p656\">\n     992 F.Supp. at\n    </extracted-citation>\n    656 ;\n    <em>\n     Willner\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"973409\" index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/977/182/#p189\">\n     977 F.Supp. at 188-190\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . It is apparent that Plaintiff's counsel did not read\n    <em>\n     Murphy\n    </em>\n    before drafting the Opposition. Had he done so, it would have been apparent that\n    <em>\n     Murphy\n    </em>\n    discussed only post-arraignment deprivations, thereby rendering\n    <em>\n     Sassower\n    </em>\n    and\n    <em>\n     Willner\n    </em>\n    inapplicable to this case. Moreover, as indicated above, much more recent Second Circuit precedent has explicitly held that, like here, a court appearance attendant to a pre-arraignment non-felony summons does not raise a liberty deprivation under the Fourth Amendment. Either Plaintiff's counsel did not discover\n    <em>\n     Burg\n    </em>\n    while drafting the Opposition, or he did and chose to ignore it. Either way, it seems clear that\n    <em>\n     Burg\n    </em>\n    precludes the reasonable assertion of a malicious prosecution claim under the circumstances.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"16\">\n   <p id=\"p-89\">\n    Though the Second Circuit held that the \"number of appearances may bear upon whether there was a seizure\", leaving open the possibility that multiple court appearances, even in the pre-arraignment, non-felony summons circumstances can give rise to a liberty deprivation,\n    <em>\n     Burg\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3507509\" index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/591/95/#p98\">\n     591 F.3d at 98\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , it is hardly conceivable that while one court appearance in such a situation does not implicate the Fourth Amendment, the addition of a second would,\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3507509\" index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/591/95/#p98\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    (\"[I]t is hard to see how multiple appearances required by a court, or for the convenience of the person answering the summons, can be attributed to the conduct of the officer who issues it.\");\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Faruki v.
