Dkt. No. 70. The Plaintiff's opposition to the motion was predicated upon its assertion that the Defendant has waived its right to that relief\n   and, alternatively, it cross moved to transfer venue to the Southern District of New York. Dkt. No. 71. Oral argument was heard on September 1, 2017 at the conclusion of which the Court denied the motion to dismiss from the bench-having determined, for the reasons stated on the record, that waiver was incontrovertible. Dkt. No. 90.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The Defendant then petitioned the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals to mandamus this Court to set aside the denial of its motion to dismiss, but was advised by that Court that moving this Court to reconsider that denial would be the appropriate course to follow in the light of its decision in\n   <em>\n    In re Micron Technology\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266696\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/875/1091/#p1100\">\n    875 F.3d 1091\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1100-01 (Fed. Cir. 2017). The advice was promptly followed with the filing of this motion. Dkt. No. 97.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The Defendant's belief that reconsideration is warranted and that its motion should be granted may be summarily rejected by adverting to Rule 6.3 of the Local Rules of the Eastern and Southern Districts Courts of New York, which requires the memorandum in support of such a motion to set forth concisely the matters or controlling decisions which counsel believes the court has overlooked. In this motion to reconsider, the judge, in a real sense, is asked to confess error-to acknowledge that he overlooked some crucial fact or decision announcing a principle of law which should have required a ruling in favor of the movant. Aware of that psychological ego impacting factor, I am also mindful of the admonition Learned Hand is said to have urged be engraved over the portals of every courthouse in the land, namely, Oliver Cromwell's letter to the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland on August 5, 1650: \"Think I beseech ye, in the bowels of Christ, that ye may be wrong.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The thrust of the defendant's motion is that I was wrong in my view that\n   <em>\n    TC Heartland v.

Cir. 2017) confirms their view that it did. In their Memorandum of Law in Support of the Motion, Dkt. No. 97-1 (DM), they state the dispositive legal standard for a motion to reconsider: \"The major grounds justifying reconsideration are\n   <em>\n    an intervening change in controlling law\n   </em>\n   , the availability of new evidence, or the need to correct a clear error or prevent manifest injustice.\" DM at 4 (emphasis added) (citations omitted). I would note that the cases that have addressed motions to reconsider have also taught that it should not be used to provide an opportunity to reargue points argued previously,\n   <em>\n    United States v. Gross\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2002%20WL%2032096592\">\n    2002 WL 32096592\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4 (E.D.N.Y. 2002), nor to repackage arguments previously made, and that the decision to grant or deny the motion rests within the sound discretion of the court.\n   <em>\n    Devlin v. Transportation Communications International Union\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1720110\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/175/121/#p132\">\n    175 F.3d 121\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 132 (2d Cir. 1999). The limitation upon the exercise of that inherent discretionary power is that it be exercised reasonably in response to the specific issue addressed and is not expressly limited by any rule or statute.\n   <em>\n    Dietz v. Bouldin\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12597482\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/1885/#p1892\">\n    136 S.Ct. 1885\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1892-93,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12597482\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/1885/#p1892\">\n    195 L.Ed.2d 161\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2016). With Judge Learned Hand's admonition clearly in mind, I am confident that in denying this motion I have not overlooked a material matter or controlling decision and that there was no intervening change in controlling law. Although a summary disposition in accordance with Rule 6.3 is warranted, a response beyond it is appropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The amount of litigation spawned by\n   <em>\n    TC Heartland\n   </em>\n   on venue in patent infringement cases and on waiver of venue is staggering,\n   as is the effect it has had on the number of those cases filed in the Delaware District Court since that case was decided.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   A more expansive disposition of this motion requires a response to two assertions made vigorously by the Defendant on the argument of the original motion to dismiss, Tr. Dkt. 90, and made again on its motion to reconsider and in its Memoranda of Law in support of those motions. DE 23, 34, 97-1 and 105. Those are: (1) that\n   <em>\n    TC Heartland\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    changed the law\n   </em>\n   governing venue in patent infringement cases; and (2) that prior to that change in the law, this motion to dismiss on venue grounds was not available and invoking waiver, therefore, would offend a fundamental understanding of the law of equity. I address those arguments in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   I.\n   <em>\n    A Change In the Law\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The judicial ink that has been spilled on these issues is considerable and I will refrain from unnecessarily spilling more. The view that the Supreme Court announced a change in the law when it decided\n   <em>\n    TC Heartland\n   </em>\n   requires the counterintuitive acceptance of the understanding that a Federal Circuit Court of Appeals can overrule (or ignore) what has been the law as decided by The Supreme Court of the United States for decades. The Appeals Court ostensibly achieving that result is\n   <em>\n    VE Holding Corp. v. Johnson Gas Appliance Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10368\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/917/1574/\">\n    917 F.2d 1574\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Fed. Cir. 1990). The issue before that court, stated simply, was whether the general venue statute,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201391\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1391\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c), amended in 1988 to provide that a defendant corporation shall be presumed to reside in any district in which it is subject to the court's personal jurisdiction was intended by Congress to be read together with \u00a7 1400 (b), the limited venue statute applicable to an action against a corporation for patent infringement, which requires the action to be brought in the state of its incorporation. The\n   <em>\n    VE Holding\n   </em>\n   court decided that it was. It arrived at that conclusion by its understanding of the rule of statutory construction that the presumption that Congress is knowledgeable about existing law pertinent to legislation does not favor maintaining the independence of the two sections. That presumption was entertained notwithstanding its acknowledgment that \"Congress has not given any indication of whether it intended to change the scope of venue under \u00a7 1400(b). If we can infer anything from Congress'[s] prior judicial interpretation of \u00a7 1400(b), given the clear language of the statute, it would be that Congress\n   <em>\n    did\n   </em>\n   intend to change the scope of venue under \u00a7 1400(b)\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10368\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/917/1574/\">\n    917 F.2d at 1581\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   That concluding inference is puzzling given the court's discussion in the pages immediately preceding it,\n   <em>\n    viz.\n   </em>\n   ,: \"The Supreme Court in 1942 and again in 1957 took a restrictive view of venue in patent infringement cases, holding in effect that the meaning of the terms used in \u00a7 1400 (b)\n   <em>\n    was not to be altered or supplemented by other provisions found in the venue statute\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10368\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/917/1574/\">\n    917 F.2d at 1577\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis mine). And again, \"[t]he specific question in\n   <em>\n    Fourco\n   </em>\n   was whether the statutory language previously enacted by the Congress as \u00a7 1391(c) supported a conclusion that Congress intended to have \u00a7\u00a7 1391(c) and 1400(b) read together. On the basis of the non-specific language of \u00a7 1391(c) and prior history as the Court read it, the Court concluded the answer was no.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10368\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/917/1574/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10368\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/917/1574/\">\n    at 1579\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Reiteration of more of the holding of\n   <em>\n    TC Heartland\n   </em>\n   may smack of gilding the lily.

The need for that protection (forum shopping aside) in the 21st century, by and large, is a matter of convenience rather than necessity, when distances have shrunk, transportation is safe and swift, communication by computer, email, fax, Skype, etc. makes the need to leave one's home or office to litigate less urgent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   These gratuitous observations having been made, induced by this litigiousness, in sum:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   \u2022 The Defendant's motion to reconsider is denied;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   \u2022 The Plaintiff's motion to transfer to the Southern District of New York is denied;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   \u2022 The Plaintiff's conditional motion to consolidate and transfer to Delaware is denied.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   The parties are directed to appear at 11:00 a.m. on August 30, 2018 for a status conference.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   SO ORDERED.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-67\">\n    Addressing the Act of March 3, 1897, the Court in\n    <em>\n     Bowers v.
