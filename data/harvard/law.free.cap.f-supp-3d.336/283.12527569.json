HELLERSTEIN, United States District Judge\n   This case concerns a tragic series of events that ended with the loss of Tyjuan Hill's life. On September 20, 2012, Mr. Hill was shot and killed by Patrick Quigley, a Sergeant in the New York Police Department. Sgt. Quigley (\"Defendant\") maintains that his use of force was legally justified because he had probable cause to believe that Mr. Hill, whom officers were attempting to arrest, posed a significant threat of death or serious physical injury to those around him. Carol Hill (\"Plaintiff\"), Tyjuan Hill's mother and Administratix of the Estate of Tyjuan Hill, claims that the use of force was excessive and violated the Fourth Amendment. The case was first tried to a jury in September 2016, ending in a mistrial after the jury was unable to reach a unanimous verdict. After a second trial in March 2018, the jury returned a unanimous verdict in favor of the defendant. Now before the Court is Plaintiff's motion for a new trial under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 59. For the reasons that follow, the motion is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The Court assumes the parties' familiarity with the facts and procedural history of this case, which has been litigated through two trials. What follows is an abbreviated summary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On September 20, 2012, New York Police Department officers in Brooklyn's 76th precinct were conducting an undercover prostitution sting in the area of Huntington and West 9th Street. Officer Cairley Rivera, posing as a prostitute, was standing on the corner of Henry and Huntington Street when she was approached by a vehicle with four male passengers. After a brief conversation concerning the price for sexual acts, a passenger exited the vehicle and attempted to pull Officer Rivera into it. Officer Rivera radioed for backup, and a take-down vehicle with other officers arrived. Three of the males in the car submitted to arrest, but the fourth, Tyjuan Hill, fled the scene on foot.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Several of the officers gave chase, and Officer Tirol eventually tackled Hill several blocks away at the corner of Hamilton and West 9th Street. Soon thereafter, Officers Gonzalez, Oliver, Ouk, Casella, and Quigley converged on the scene to assist Officer Tirol in attempting to place Mr. Hill in handcuffs. A struggle ensued. The officers succeeded in handcuffing one of Mr. Hill's wrists, but were unable to fasten the handcuffs to the second wrist. Sgt. Quigley arrived last on the scene, placed his left shin on Mr. Hill's back, and assisted his fellow officers. Moments later, Sgt. Quigley claims, Mr. Hill extracted a handgun from his waistband and pointed it at the officers. Sgt. Quigley then fatally shot Hill in the back of the head. A gun was found a short distance away from Mr. Hill's body, situated atop a nearby curb. A forensic examination of the gun revealed traces of Hill's DNA on the trigger of the firearm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff Carol Hill filled this action as Administratrix of Tyjuan Hill's estate on November 29, 2012, under the Civil Rights Law,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . After years of discovery and motion practice, the case was\n   tried to a jury in September 2016. Plaintiff asserted two claims at the first trial: excessive force against Sgt. Quigley for the shooting and failure to intervene against Officers Casella, Gonzalez, Oliver, Ouk, and Tirol. After lengthy deliberations, the jury was unable to reach a unanimous decision against any of the defendants. A mistrial was declared. In an Order dated January 25, 2017, I held that defendants Casella, Gonzalez, Oliver, Ouk, and Tirol were entitled to judgment as a matter of law on plaintiff's failure to intervene claims against them.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Order Granting Motion for Judgment as a Matter of Law in Part and Denying in Part,\n   <em>\n    Hill v. Quigley et al.\n   </em>\n   , 12 Civ. 8691 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 25, 2017). Plaintiff's claim against Sgt. Quigley remained for retrial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The case was tried to a jury a second time in March 2018. As in the first trial, defendant \"offered testimonial, expert, and forensic evidence-including traces of Hill's DNA on the trigger of the firearm, an audio recording of the incident, and supporting testimony from the other officers that Hill threatened Quigley with a firearm-that would allow a reasonable juror to infer that Quigley shot in self-defense.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *2. Arguing that Sgt. Quigley's use of force was excessive, plaintiff introduced eyewitness testimony from bystanders sitting in nearby cars that Mr. Hill did not have a gun at the time of the shooting and that, in any event, he could not, pinned face down to the ground, have brandished a gun in the manner that Sgt. Quigley and the other officers claimed. The jury returned a verdict in favor of the defendant, and the Court entered judgment in defendant's favor on April 27, 2018. Plaintiff timely filed this motion for a new trial under Rule 59 on May 25, 2018. For the reasons that follow, the motion is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 59 grants a court discretion to \"grant a new trial on all or some of the issues ... for any reason for which a new trial has heretofore been granted in an action at law in federal court.\" Fed.

Specifically, plaintiff points to a line of Second Circuit cases, starting with\n   <em>\n    Rasanen v. Doe\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Callahan v. Wilson\n   </em>\n   , which hold that a jury \" 'must' be instructed that the use of deadly force is '\n   <em>\n    unreasonable unless\n   </em>\n   the officer had probable cause to believe that the suspect posed a significant threat of death or serious physical injury to the officer or to others.' \"\n   <em>\n    Callahan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275785\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/863/144/\">\n    863 F.3d at 151\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Rasanen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4064534\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/723/325/\">\n    723 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   334 ). Put differently, a jury in a deadly force case should be given the probable instruction in restrictive terms-i.e., that the use of deadly force is\n   <em>\n    unreasonable unless\n   </em>\n   the officer had probable cause, rather than that an officer\n   <em>\n    may\n   </em>\n   use deadly force\n   <em>\n    if\n   </em>\n   the officer has probable cause.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4064534\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/723/325/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   As discussed below, my charge failed to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   This issue was not raised by either party before the jury was charged. Plaintiff's counsel did not submit a request to charge on excessive force prior to either trial in this case,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff's Request to Charge, ECF 206, nor was the issue sufficiently raised during the charge conference, held on March 19, 2018, the afternoon before the jury was charged. At the conference, plaintiff's counsel specifically requested that I instruct the jury that a police officer may use lethal force if he has \"probable cause to believe that the person poses a significant threat of death or serious physical injury to the policeman or to another.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Trans. at 598-99. While identical language appeared elsewhere in my proposed charge, plaintiff's counsel argued, and I agreed, that the jury should receive consistent language throughout.

We would ask for a sentence following that final sentence stating the converse proposition which is that if the policeman does not have probable cause to believe that the person poses a significant threat of\n   death or serious bodily harm, the police officer may not use lethal force.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   THE COURT: I resist redundancy. That's redundant.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   MR. SHANIES: Respectfully, your Honor, we see a lot of ways where the jury can find there is not excessive force and in many cases it's not balanced by a statement that if the officer does exceed the standard that it would be excessive force.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   THE COURT: It's said in the last sentence and now I'm defining excessive force in. It's said in the last paragraph. I'm sorry. There's a balance in this paragraph and this is the definition.

Moreover, granting plaintiff's request would not have remedied the error, for\n   <em>\n    Rasanen\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Callahan\n   </em>\n   teach that a jury should be given\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   the restrictive \"unless/only\" instruction, not that the permissive \"may/if\" formulation should be balanced by the restrictive instruction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Callahan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275785\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/863/144/\">\n    863 F.3d at 151\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

My instruction on excessive force read as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   If the person to be arrested flees, the police may use force to apprehend and arrest that person. The police may use any such force as is reasonable in the circumstances to successfully arrest someone who the police officer has probable cause to believe committed a crime but the police may not use excessive force, that is more force than is reasonably necessary to effectuate an arrest, or to subdue someone who is fleeing to avoid being arrested. If the policeman uses excessive force in subduing such a person, the person's constitutional right to life and liberty and due process of law are violated.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   Was the force reasonable or was it excessive?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   Excessive force is unreasonable force.

There is no ambiguity in that charge.

Immediately thereafter, I twice reiterated the probable cause standard,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Trans. at 683, further focusing the jury's deliberations. The jury also was specifically instructed that although an officer is permitted to use force to effectuate an arrest, \"the police may not use excessive force, that is more force than is reasonably necessary.\" Trans. at 682. My instructions did not, as the Court of Appeals found objectionable in\n   <em>\n    Callahan\n   </em>\n   , contain a litany of \"permissive\" language that \"diluted\" the probable cause standard.\n   <em>\n    Callahan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275785\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/863/144/\">\n    863 F.3d at 151-52\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

There was an incident involving law enforcement and Mr. Hill. During that incident defendant, Patrick Quigley, used lethal force against Tyjuan Hill. Plaintiff claims that the force against Tyjuan Hill by defendant Quigley was excessive and unreasonable in violation of his constitutional rights. Defendant denies the plaintiff's allegations.\n   <em>\n    Defendant asserts that he acted properly as an officer of the NYPD, that Mr. Hill was resisting arrest and that Mr. Quigley had probable cause to believe that Mr. Hill posed a threat of death or serious physical injury to him and his fellow officers.\n   </em>\n   Neither the plaintiff's nor the defendant's allegations are proofs. They are merely assertions.

Specifically, plaintiff takes issue with my description of the defendant's case, italicized above. Plaintiff claims that the inclusion of the first two clauses, which referred to whether Sgt. Quigley acted properly as a police officer and whether Mr. Hill resisted arrest, \"compounded the\n   <em>\n    Rasanen\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    /\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Callahan\n   </em>\n   error\" by leading the jury to believe that these clauses constituted separate defenses to plaintiff's excessive force claim. Pl. Memo., ECF 402, at 7. In overruling the same objection at the charge conference, I held: \"I think it's their summary, Mr. Shaneis, [and consistent with] what I read to the jury originally. I'll leave it alone and there are specific instructions\n   later on that made it quite clear.\" Trans. at 591. This ruling was not in error.

My introductory remarks did not undermine anyone's rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Plaintiff also argues that references to \"immunity\" within the charge improperly invited the jury to speculate on the question of qualified immunity. The word \"immunity\" appeared twice in my charge. The first reference appears in a section of the charge in which I repeated each side's contentions:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   Plaintiff alleges that defendant used excessive force when he shot Tyjuan Hill. Defendant claims that he shot in self-defense to protect himself and other officers seeking to arrest Tyjuan Hill and that he was acting lawfully as a police officer in trying to effectuate an arrest of Tyjuan Hill and he was acting within his\n   <em>\n    immunity\n   </em>\n   as a police officer. Let me go into all of that.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Trans. at 681. Then, I followed that with substantive descriptions:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   If the policeman has probable cause to believe that the person arrested poses a significant threat of death or serious bodily injury, the policeman may use lethal force against that person and has an\n   <em>\n    immunity\n   </em>\n   from liability if that is what happened. The question is whether the totality of circumstances provided probable cause for an officer to believe that he or others faced a significant threat of death or serious physical harm.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Trans. at 681, 683. The jury was not misled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The reference to \"immunity\" did not muddle the applicable legal standards. The doctrine of qualified immunity is a question of law for the Court,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hunter v.

After reviewing the case and drafting additional language on the issue overnight, I proposed the following charge:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   The fourth element of a claim under Section 1983 is that the defendant acted intentionally or recklessly when he committed the facts that [deprived] Mr. Hill of his constitutional right not to be subjected to excessive force. In order for the plaintiff to establish this element, plaintiff must show by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant intended to commit the acts that deprived Tyjuan Hill of his constitutional right or acted with reckless disregard that his actions would deprive Tyjuan Hill of his constitutional right. You have to find intent or recklessness in Sergeant Quigley's actions, not in whether he intended also to deprive Mr. Hill of his rights under the constitution. An act is intentional if it is done knowingly. That is if it is done voluntarily and deliberately and not because of mistake, accident negligence or any other innocent reason.

It's a phrase that may be appropriate with the factual\n   situation in [Dancy] which had to do with unlawful seizure. It doesn't have anything related to the case at hand. In fact, the phrase \"objectively reasonable\" is inconsistent with intent. It creates another standard.

Connor\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"605535\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/490/386/#p397\">\n    490 U.S. 386\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 397,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"605535\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/490/386/#p397\">\n    109 S.Ct. 1865\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"605535\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/490/386/#p397\">\n    104 L.Ed.2d 443\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1989), is different from the intent that must be proven for an excessive force claim. As the Court in\n   <em>\n    Dancy\n   </em>\n   put it:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   Once a seizure has been set in motion by an intentional act, the Fourth Amendment's \"reasonableness\" standard applies to the manner in which the seizure is executed. This applies to all officer actions, \"without regard to their underlying intent,\" and lasts at least until \"the point at which the arrest ends and pretrial detention begins.\" Thus, once a seizure is initiated, an officer's objectively unreasonable conduct may violate the Fourth Amendment regardless of whether the officer intended any injury to result.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 117 (citations omitted) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Graham\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"605535\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/490/386/#p397\">\n    490 U.S. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   395 n. 10, 397,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"605535\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/490/386/#p397\">\n    109 S.Ct. 1865\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). The law requires than the officer act intentionally. The standard of intentionality cannot be lessened by an adverb, \"objective reasonableness.\" As long as the police officer acted \"intentionally,\" the fourth element was satisfied. The jury was instructed accordingly.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   The jury just had heard the requirements of the third element plaintiff had to prove by a preponderance of the evidence: whether the amount of force employed by Sgt. Quigley was excessive or not. Using the phrase \"objectively unreasonable\" to qualify \"intentional\" would have conflated two elements of plaintiff's burden, and confused, rather than enlightened the jury.\n   <em>\n    Dancy\n   </em>\n   does not require that I do that.\n   <em>\n    Dancy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12171832\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/843/93/\">\n    843 F.3d at 117\n   </extracted-citation>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Moreover, the element of intent was not disputed by the parties. There was no question that Sgt. Quigley acted intentionally. He so testified, stating that he believed that it was necessary to shoot Mr. Hill to save his life and the lives of his fellow officers. Plaintiff seeks to argue an issue that does not exist. The jury was instructed that it must \"find intent or recklessness in Sergeant Quigley's actions, not in whether he intended also to deprive Mr. Hill of his rights under the constitution.\" Trans. at 686. This charge was consistent with\n   <em>\n    Dancy\n   </em>\n   , and plaintiff is not entitled to a new trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Evidentiary Rulings\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Plaintiff also takes issue with several of the Court's evidentiary rulings. In general, \"an erroneous evidentiary ruling warrants a new trial only when a substantial right of a party is affected, as when a jury's judgment would be swayed in a material fashion by the error.\"\n   <em>\n    Restivo v. Hessemann\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12128851\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/846/547/#p573\">\n    846 F.3d 547\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 573 (2d Cir. 2017) (internal quotation marks omitted). As noted above, a new trial is an extraordinary remedy that \"ordinarily should not be granted unless the trial court is convinced that the jury has reached a seriously erroneous result or that the verdict is a miscarriage of justice.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   <em>\n    Hugo Boss\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11087931\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/252/608/#p623\">\n    252 F.3d at 623\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted). For the reasons that follow, plaintiff is not entitled to a new trial on the basis of the challenged evidentiary rulings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    911 Calls\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Plaintiff argues that the Court erred by conditionally excluding a 911 call placed by Darious Smith, a civilian eyewitness to the shooting. At trial, Smith testified that he saw the struggle between Mr. Hill and the officers and that, although Mr. Hill was resisting arrest, he did not have a gun in his hand at the time of the shooting. Plaintiff also sought to introduce Smith's 911 call, placed immediately after the shooting, to corroborate his in-court testimony. Acknowledging that the 911 call was hearsay, plaintiff offered the evidence under the excited utterance and present sense impression exceptions to the hearsay rule.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Evid. 803(1)-(2). Rather than admit a recording or transcript of the call, I held, under Rule 403, that plaintiff could introduce Smith's 911 call on redirect examination, but only if Smith's credibility was impeached on cross examination. This ruling was not in error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   A district court has broad discretion to admit relevant, probative evidence under Federal Rule of Evidence 401, and to exclude otherwise relevant evidence under Rule 403 when its \"probative value is substantially outweighed by a danger of one or more of the following: unfair prejudice, confusing the issues, misleading the jury, undue delay, wasting time, or needlessly presenting cumulative evidence.\" Fed. R. Evid. 403. The 911 call at issue here did nothing more than restate Smith's in-court testimony. Balanced against its limited probative value, I determined that the emotional, frantic nature of the call was cumulative and likely to create a danger of unfair prejudice to defendant, and excluded the call on that basis. Nonetheless, I held that if the call became relevant-i.e., if the witness's credibility was impeached-plaintiff could introduce the call to rehabilitate Smith's credibility. In this way, my ruling struck a balance that was consistent with Rule 403.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   In any event, Smith's 911 call would have done nothing more than corroborate his in-court testimony, which, was not impeached. The evidence was cumulative, potentially prejudicial, and marginally relevant in the context of the testimony elicited at trial. My ruling was not erroneous, much less an abuse of discretion, and plaintiff has not demonstrated that exclusion likely swayed the jury in a material fashion.\n   <em>\n    Restivo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12128851\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/846/547/#p573\">\n    846 F.3d at 573\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Owen's Expert Testimony\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Plaintiff also challenges the Court's November 2, 2018 ruling that excluded the testimony of Jennifer Owen, a purported audio and voice identification expert. A central issue at trial was whether Mr. Hill brandished a firearm during the course of his arrest. In addition to the officers' testimony that Mr. Hill had done so and that a gun was found later not far from him at the scene, defendant relied on a police radio transmission on which someone can be heard shouting \"gun gun gun gun gun!\" That those words were spoken was undisputed. However, the parties dispute when they were spoken. Defendant argued, based on testimony from officers on the scene, that Officer Tirol shouted the words immediately before Sgt. Quigley pulled the trigger, and that Tirol's radio inadvertently caught the exclamation during the struggle with Mr. Hill. Plaintiff argued, based on testimony of civilian eyewitnesses sitting in automobiles stopped nearby, that Mr. Hill did not appear to have a gun in his hand. Plaintiff argued that Officer Tirol's exclamation-\"gun gun gun gun gun!\"-was contrived, that it was shouted\n   immediately after the shooting to cover Sgt. Quigley.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   To support plaintiff's argument, plaintiff proposed to call Jennifer Owen, a purported audio and voice identification expert, to testify that the exclamation-\"gun gun gun gun gun!\"-could be heard on an iPhone video recording made by the civilian witnesses immediately after the shooting. After manipulating the iPhone video in an effort to enhance the sounds, Ms. Owen listened to the iPhone video and the police recording several times and isolated a portion of each she deemed similar. She then conducted what she called a statistical comparison of the energy and pitch of the two samples. From the comparison, Ms. Owen sought to testify that the two samples were materially similar in energy and pitch. And since they were found to be similar, and since the iPhone recording was made after the shooting, Ms. Owen offered to testify that Officer Tirol's shout occurred after the shooting, as a cover-up.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Owen Expert Report, ECF 324, Ex. B, at 7-8, 20 (stating that the objective of the analysis was to \"explore the possibility that two different recorders\" had captured the same speech). After a\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   hearing held November 2, 2018, I ruled that Ms. Owen's testimony was inadmissible under Fed. R. Evid. 702. I believe that my ruling was correct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Federal Rule of Evidence 702 provides the standards for admissible expert witness testimony:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-85\">\n   A witness who is qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education may testify in the form of an opinion or otherwise if:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-86\">\n   (a) the expert's scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge will help the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-87\">\n   (b) the testimony is based on sufficient facts or data;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-88\">\n   (c) the testimony is the product of reliable principles and methods; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-89\">\n   (d) the expert has reliably applied the principles and methods to the facts of the case.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Fed. R. Evid. 702. As a gatekeeper, a judge has \"the task of ensuring that an expert's testimony both rests on a reliable foundation and is relevant to the task at hand.\"\n   <em>\n    Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharm., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"355769\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/509/579/#p597\">\n    509 U.S. 579\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 597,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"355769\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/509/579/#p597\">\n    113 S.Ct. 2786\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"355769\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/509/579/#p597\">\n    125 L.Ed.2d 469\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1993).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Several aspects of Ms. Owen's methodology were unreliable. First, Ms. Owen admitted in her report and proffered testimony that the audio samples on which her testimony would be based were not long enough to conduct a full voice identification analysis. Instead, her analysis was limited to a comparison of energy, also known as amplitude or volume, and pitch, commonly known as how high or low one's speech is. Both measures are, in Ms. Owen's words, \"auxiliary methods\" for audio comparison.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Owen Expert Report, ECF 324, Ex. B, at 20. Ms. Owen also readily acknowledged that the two samples varied significantly \"in light of the different acoustical backgrounds of the recordings.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"355769\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/509/579/#p597\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Based on these limitations, Ms. Owen's proffered\n   testimony would have concluded that that the similarities in energy and pitch, themselves auxiliary methods for comparing audio samples, were due to actual similarities between the two recordings, but any differences could be explained away by differences in acoustical background, notwithstanding the fact that she claimed to have controlled for acoustical background in other parts of her analysis. It was also not clear from Ms. Owen's report or testimony what precise methodology she used to control for background noise, which she described was a crucial aspect of the analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   It was also unclear how Ms. Owen selected the particular samples she analyzed to prove the point she wished to make. So far as the Court can discern, it appears that Ms. Owen simply listened to the two recordings several times, isolating portions she deemed similar and conducting statistical testing on the samples she selected by ear. Her report states: \"Audibly, I can say with confidence that it is highly probable that both recordings captured the speech 'gun, gun, gun, gun, gun, gun' ....\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9. Every aspect of Ms. Owen's analysis appears to have been reasoned backward from her conclusion, without a reliable methodological or statistical basis for selecting among possible samples. Without some scientifically reliable methodology, her proffered testimony was not reliable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   Additionally, beyond reciting simple statistical figures, Ms. Owen performed no statistical comparison to determine whether the similarities between the mean energy and pitch data were statistically significant. For instance, Ms. Owen offered to testify that the mean frequency of the two samples differed by just under seven percent, that the mean Fo figures\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   differed by just under eight percent, and that the mean energy figures differed by less than two percent.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   But raw data would have told the jury next to nothing. Ms. Owens did not conduct any analysis of statistical significance, nor could she explain based on her experience in the field whether the differences she identified were meaningful or should be discarded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   \"[I]t is critical that an expert's analysis be reliable at every step.\"\n   <em>\n    Amorgianos\n   </em>\n   , 303 F.3d at 267. Indeed, \"any step that renders the analysis unreliable under the\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   factors renders the expert's testimony inadmissible\" in its entirety.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Ms. Owen's methodology failed this test.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   After I ruled, the video was played again, and counsel and I listened carefully for any sounds that would enable a jury to conclude that \"gun gun gun gun gun!\" was shouted on the iPhone recording. There was none, and counsel could point to none. The Court did not err in excluding Ms. Owen's proffered testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   <strong>\n    C. The Court's Questioning Under Rule 614\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Finally, plaintiff argues that in my questioning of witnesses at trial, I exceeded my authority under Federal Rule of Evidence 614. Rule 614(b) provides that \"[t]he court may examine a witness regardless of who calls the witness.\" Consistent with the Rules, it is well settled that trial judges have \"an active responsibility to insure that issues are clearly presented to the jury.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Pisani\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"18759\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/773/397/#p403\">\n    773 F.2d 397\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 403 (2d Cir. 1985). \"[T]he questioning of witnesses by a trial judge, if for a proper purpose such as clarifying ambiguities, correcting misstatements, or obtaining information needed to make rulings, is well within that responsibility.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"18759\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/773/397/#p403\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   After reviewing the record, it is clear that the Court's questions were even-handed\n   and intended to illuminate the issues for the jury, rather than to advocate for either party.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Care Travel Co. v.

And in any event, the Court expressly instructed the jury that it was to draw no inference from the Court's questioning of witnesses:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-99\">\n   From time to time I asked questions of the witnesses or sought clarification of various issues.
