She seeks an order enjoining Defendant Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich from implementing or enforcing H.B. 2023.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Knox initiated this action on July 3, 2018, concurrently filing a complaint and a motion for a preliminary injunction. (Docs. 1-2.) In her preliminary injunction motion, Knox requested both expedited relief and consolidation of the preliminary injunction hearing with the trial on the merits pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65(a)(2). After conferencing with the parties telephonically on July 11, 2018, the Court granted Knox's request to expedite and consolidate the preliminary injunction hearing with the trial on the merits because this case presents pure questions of law and no factual disputes. In lieu of standard case management procedures, the Court set a briefing and hearing schedule on Knox's preliminary injunction motion, which functionally became an opening trial brief. (Doc. 10.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On August 10, 2018, the Court conducted a consolidated preliminary injunction hearing and bench trial (hereinafter \"consolidated hearing\"). (Doc. 22.)

A.R.S. \u00a7 16-541. \"In 2007, Arizona implemented permanent no-excuse early voting by mail, known as the Permanent Early Voter List ('PEVL'). Arizonans now may vote early by mail either by requesting an early ballot on an election-by-election basis, or by joining the PEVL, in which case they will be sent an early ballot as a matter of course no later than the first day of the 27-day early voting period.\"\n   <em>\n    Democratic Nat'l Comm. v.

(Doc. 1 \u00b6 17.) A substantial part of Knox's community involvement is door-to-door canvassing. (\u00b6 18.) When Knox canvasses, she often encourages voters to complete and mail their early ballots. (\u00b6 20.) Before the 2016 election cycle, Knox collected and delivered ballots on behalf of voters she met while canvassing and who requested such service. (\u00b6\u00b6 21-22.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In 2016, however, Arizona enacted H.B. 2023, which limits who may collect a voter's voted or unvoted early ballot as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   H. A person who knowingly collects voted or unvoted early ballots from another person is guilty of a class 6 felony. An election official, a United States postal service worker or any other person who is allowed by law to transmit United States mail is deemed not to have collected an early ballot if the official, worker or other person is engaged in official duties.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   I.

A family member, household member or caregiver of the voter. For the purposes of this paragraph:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   (a) \"Caregiver\" means a person who provides medical or health care assistance to the voter in a residence, nursing care institution, hospice facility, assisted living center, assisted living facility, assisted living home, residential care institution, adult day health care facility or adult foster care home.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   (b) \"Collects\" means to gain possession or control of an early ballot.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   (c) \"Family member\" means a person who is related to the voter by blood, marriage, adoption or legal guardianship.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   (d) \"Household member\" means a person who resides at the same residence as the voter.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   A.R.S. \u00a7 16-1005(H)-(I). \"Voters therefore may entrust a caregiver, family member, household member, mail carrier, or elections official to return their early ballots, but may not entrust other, unauthorized third parties to do so.\"\n   <em>\n    DNC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%202191664\">\n    2018 WL 2191664\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *8. Knox actively opposed H.B. 2023, testifying against the measure on behalf of LWVAZ. (Doc. 26 at 71.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Since H.B. 2023's enactment, Knox has not offered to collect or deliver another person's early ballot, even if someone asks her for such assistance, because she understands that she now is \"prohibited from collecting and delivering another person's early ballot.\" (Doc. 1 \u00b6 24; Doc. 1-1 \u00b6 10.) Knox plans to canvass during the 2018 election cycle, but in the absence of a court order enjoining enforcement of H.B. 2023, she will not offer or engage in ballot collection services. (Doc. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 32, 57.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Legal Standard\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Although Knox's motion seeks a preliminary injunction, the standards governing the issuance of a permanent injunction now govern because the Court granted Knox's request to consolidate the preliminary injunction hearing with the trial on the merits. Before the Court may grant a permanent injunction, Knox must succeed on the merits of at least one of her claims and also prove:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   (1) that [she] has suffered an irreparable injury; (2) that remedies available at law, such as monetary damages, are inadequate to compensate for that injury; (3) that, considering the balance of hardships between the plaintiff and defendant, a remedy in equity is warranted; and (4) that the public interest would not be disserved by a permanent injunction.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <em>\n    eBay Inc. v.

Accordingly, Knox contends that H.B. 2023 is preempted because it prohibits certain private parties from doing that which the aforementioned exceptions to the PES otherwise would allow: namely, providing gratuitous private letter delivery services or carrying letters prior or subsequent to mailing. Knox's preemption challenge is not based on an express preemption provision in the relevant federal postal laws. Instead, her challenge is predicated on field and conflict preemption principles. With respect to conflict preemption, Knox does not argue that it is impossible to comply with both H.B. 2023 and the PES exceptions. Rather, she contends that H.B. 2023 presents an obstacle to the full purpose and intent of the federal postal scheme.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   As a preliminary matter, the Court agrees with Knox that an early ballot, once completed and appropriately addressed, satisfies the federal definition of \"letter\" and therefore becomes mailable matter, meaning such ballots may enter the federal mail stream if the sender wishes to utilize the USPS. Additionally, \"[t]here is little doubt that the federal statutory scheme for handling, delivering and sorting the mails is comprehensive.\"\n   <em>\n    Conte &amp; Co., Inc. v. Stephan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7398774\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/713/1382/#p1386\">\n    713 F.Supp. 1382\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1386 (D. Kan. 1989). But the Court finds little evidence that Congress, in codifying the aforementioned exceptions to the PES, intended to foreclose state laws like H.B. 2023. Nor does the Court find that these exceptions to the PES are so integral to the federal scheme that supplemental state regulation stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment of Congress' full objectives.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Legislative history on the purpose behind these exceptions is sparse. Knox cited\n   two documents touching on the subject. First, in 1979, Louis A. Cox, General Counsel for the USPS, testified before the House Subcommittee on Post Office and Civil Service regarding the purposes and interpretation of the PES.\n   <em>\n    Hearing Before Subcomm. on\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Postal Operations and Servs.\n   </em>\n   , 96 Cong. 11-32 (1979) (Statement of Louis A. Cox, USPS General Counsel). While summarizing the exceptions to the postal monopoly, Cox remarked: \"You can always take a friend's letter down the street as a friendly gesture without running afoul of the [PES].\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12. But Cox's testimony merely acknowledges the existence of the Private Hands exception; it does nothing to elucidate Congress' intent in codifying it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Second, on July 9, 1935, Matthew F. McGuire, a Special Attorney of the Department of Justice, testified before the House Subcommittee on the Post Office and Post Roads regarding the history, purposes, and proper interpretation of the PES.\n   <em>\n    Hearing Before Subcomm. on Postal Office and Postal Roads\n   </em>\n   , 74 Cong. 10-13 (1935) (Statement of Matthew F. McGuire, Special Attorney, Dep't of Justice),\n   <em>\n    available at\n   </em>\n   (Doc. 25-1 at 12-15). When speaking about the Private Hands exception, McGuire stated the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   The history of that particular exception is interesting. It was at a time when post roads had not been established except between the larger cities in the country, and as a consequence, some man living far off a post road, might want to send a letter or a message to some other individual not on a post road. The Congress wanted to give him authority or the right to send a communication to his friend by private hands. As the country developed, post roads were established everywhere, and that exception was carried down with that limitation placed upon it, and it is still possible to send a message by private hands without compensation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11-12. It therefore appears that the Private Hands exception was intended to address a problem-delivery of letters to or from areas far away from a post road-that had diminished by 1935 because, by then, \"post roads were established everywhere.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Viewing these exceptions in the broader context of the PES, Congress did not intend to preempt state laws such as H.B. 2023. As previously explained, the PES were enacted to ensure that the USPS remained financially viable and capable of servicing all areas at a uniform rate. Knox herself acknowledges that, \"[f]rom its inception, the monopoly granted the USPS had always been limited to the carriage of mail 'for hire.' \" (Doc. 2 at 4.) Accordingly, the field Congress intended to occupy was the carriage of mail\n   <em>\n    for hire.\n   </em>\n   By carving out the aforementioned exceptions to the otherwise applicable postal monopoly, Congress evinced an intent\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   to comprehensively regulate this area because gratuitous, private delivery of a letter or the carriage of letters prior or subsequent to mailing are activities that do not meaningfully affect the financial viability of the USPS. Congress did not intend to supplant state control over the handling of early ballots simply because it exempted from the criminal penalties associated with competing with the federal government's postal monopoly activities that would not normally affect the USPS's operations.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   To the contrary, the Supreme Court has long stated that \"the limits of state regulatory power in relation to the federal mail service involve situations where state regulation involved a direct, physical interference with federal activities under the postal power or some direct, immediate burden on the performance of the postal functions.\"\n   <em>\n    Railway Mail Ass'n v.

Nor has Knox cited authority for the proposition that private individuals become part of the federal postal functions simply by carrying an item that could, in theory, enter the federal mail stream if deposited with the USPS. The Court therefore concludes that H.B. 2023 is not preempted by federal postal laws because the law \"does not impinge on federal mail service or the power of the government to conduct it.\"\n   <em>\n    Conte\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7398774\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/713/1382/#p1386\">\n    713 F.Supp. at 1384\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

Her First Amendment claim takes two forms. First, she argues that H.B. 2023 constitutes a speech restriction because it regulates the use and delivery of mail. (Doc. 2 at 12.) Second, Knox asserts that H.B. 2023 regulates \"speech-facilitating conduct.\" (Doc. 15 at 9.) That is, Knox contends that the act of collecting and delivering a voter's completed early ballot is protected by the First Amendment because it facilitates the communication of the voter's message, and because, in deciding\n   whose ballots to collect, Knox herself communicates a message. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9-10.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   As the party invoking the First Amendment's protections, Knox bears the burden of proving that those protections apply to the conduct at issue.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Clark v.

Indeed, during the consolidated hearing, Knox readily admitted that \"the core of [her] claim is that [ballot collection] is speech-facilitating conduct ... protected by the First Amendment.\" (Doc. 26 at 31.)

She contends that the law is vague because it does not define these phrases. As it pertains to her, specifically, Knox states that she believes the exceptions to the PES allow her to \"transmit United States mail,\" but does not know what is meant by \"engaged in official duties.\" Knox points to her role as a Democratic PC and notes that, under Arizona law, \"[t]he minimum duties of a [PC] shall be to assist the [PC's] political party in voter registration and to assist the voters of that political party to vote on election days.\" A.R.S. \u00a7 16-822(E). Because Knox believes ballot collection is an important method of assisting voters, she contends that she might reasonably fall within H.B. 2023's exceptions, but nonetheless\n   fears prosecution because, in her view, the law does not adequately define when someone is allowed by law to transmit mail as part of her official duties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   The Court concludes that H.B. 2023 is not unconstitutionally vague. A person of ordinarily intelligence can comprehend what the law prohibits and what it allows. With respect to Knox, although nothing in the PES prohibits her from gratuitously carrying letters for others, or from carrying letters prior or subsequent to mailing, nothing in federal law allows her to transmit mail once it has entered the federal mail stream. Moreover, even assuming that the PES's exceptions authorize her to \"transmit United States mail,\" as opposed to simply carrying potentially mailable matter (i.e., letters) outside the federal mail stream, there is no evidence that Knox's official duties as a PC include the transmission of mail. Section 16-822(E) requires PC's to assist voters on Election Day; it does not require PC's to carry mail. Any ambiguity results from the way in which A.R.S. \u00a7 16-822(E) describes the role of a PC and how liberally Knox interprets that role, rather than vagueness in H.B. 2023 itself. Moreover, Knox admittedly understands that she now is \"prohibited from collecting and delivering another person's early ballot.\" (Doc. 1 \u00b6 24; Doc. 1-1 \u00b6 10.) She cannot credibly claim that H.B. 2023 will punish her for behavior she could not have known is illegal when she readily acknowledges that she understands her conduct would be prosecuted under the law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   The Court also finds that H.B. 2023 is not especially susceptible to arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement, or that it will chill the free exercise of First Amendment freedoms. To the first point, Knox argues that H.B. 2023 authorizes subjective, arbitrary enforcement because the Maricopa County Attorney recently issued a statement reminding county residents that \"anyone who may be planning to engage in ballot harvesting for this Primary Election and General Election,\" risks committing \"a class 6 felony ... unless you are a family member, household member, or caregiver of the voter to whom the ballot was issued,\" but omitting reference to the exception for other persons allowed by law to transmit mail in the course of their official duties. (Docs. 15 at 12, 15-1.) The Court does not find a likelihood of arbitrary or discriminatory enforcement simply because one Arizona county attorney's office issued a statement that perhaps was not as comprehensive as it could have been.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   As to the second point, the Court has concluded (twice now) that ballot collection is not an inherently expressive activity subject to the First Amendment's protections. Accordingly, enforcement of H.B. 2023 does not risk chilling the free exercise of First Amendment freedoms. Knox's vagueness challenge therefore is rejected.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Brnovich's Affirmative Defenses\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Because the Court rejects Knox's constitutional claims on their merits, it need not address Brnovich's affirmative defenses based on laches and the Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Purcell v. Gonzalez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3553561\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/549/1/\">\n    549 U.S. 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3553561\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/549/1/\">\n    127 S.Ct. 5\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3553561\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/549/1/\">\n    166 L.Ed.2d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2006), which has been interpreted to discourage courts from issuing orders changing a state's electoral rules too close to an election. Nonetheless, the Court will comment briefly on these matters.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Neither laches nor\n   <em>\n    Purcell\n   </em>\n   bars Knox from litigating the merits of her claims, or from eventually obtaining relief if those claims proved successful. At most, laches and\n   <em>\n    Purcell\n   </em>\n   might affect Knox's ability to obtain expedited relief. That is, because Knox waited until the start of the 2018 election cycle to bring these claims, laches and\n   <em>\n    Purcell\n   </em>\n   might counsel against enjoining H.B. 2023 prior to the 2018 primary or\n   general elections.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ariz. Libertarian Party v. Reagan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12135980\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/189/920/#p925\">\n    189 F.Supp.3d 920\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 925 (D. Ariz. 2016) (applying laches to bar only the plaintiffs' request for emergency relief, but allowing the case to continue on the merits because the challenged practice \"will continue to apply in future elections if it is not invalidated by a court or revised by the Legislature\"). But to the extent Brnovich argues these doctrines require dismissal of Knox's claims, his argument is not well-taken.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   With that said, the timing of this lawsuit is not optimal. Arizona enacted H.B. 2023 in 2016. Knox knew about the law at that time and actively opposed its passage. Knox also engaged in ballot collection prior to H.B. 2023's passage and has desired to do so since. She therefore could have challenged H.B. 2023 at any point after its passage, including by intervening in the\n   <em>\n    DNC\n   </em>\n   litigation or bringing a lawsuit at any point in 2017, when no statewide elections were scheduled. An earlier challenge would have provided the parties and the Court with more time to consider these important constitutional questions, afforded time for appellate review, and allowed Arizona to respond to or implement any resulting court orders prior to the start of a statewide election season.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12135980\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/189/920/#p925\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12135980\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/189/920/#p925\">\n    at 923\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (highlighting the prejudice that delayed filings work on the administration of justice, particularly by rushing judicial decision making). Though the timing of this lawsuit resulted not from bad faith, but from Knox's mistaken belief that she could not challenge H.B. 2023 while another case (\n   <em>\n    DNC\n   </em>\n   ) was pending, her decision to bring it mere weeks before the start of statewide early voting needlessly created an exigency that could have been avoided had the lawsuit been filed prior to the cusp of the 2018 election season.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   For these reasons, the Court concludes that H.B. 2023 is not preempted by the exceptions to the PES, does not violate Knox's First Amendment rights, and is not unconstitutionally vague.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   as follows:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   1.

Specifically, Knox requested that the Court accept as true the factual allegations in her complaint and dismiss Brnovich's affirmative defenses because Brnovich did not file an answer. (Doc. 26 at 82-83.) Knox's oral motion is denied because it is unnecessary and not well-taken.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-78\">\n    The motion is unnecessary because the parties agree that the facts relevant to the Court's decision are undisputed. Brnovich conceded during the consolidated hearing that he does not dispute any of the factual allegations in Knox's complaint; he merely disagrees with Knox's interpretation and application of law to those facts. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 88-89.) This also is true for the facts relevant to Brnovich's affirmative defenses. No party disputes when Knox learned about H.B. 2023, when she opposed it, how long she has desired to collect and deliver voters' early ballots, or how long she waited after H.B. 2023 took effect to bring this lawsuit. The parties merely disagree over how the law should apply to those facts.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-79\">\n    The motion is not well-taken because, in consolidating the preliminary injunction hearing with the trial on the merits and setting a corresponding briefing schedule, the Court intended to replace the Federal Rules' default case management procedures with a more expeditious, streamlined process that would ensure the \"just, speedy, and inexpensive\" resolution of this case before the August 28, 2018 primary election. Fed. R. Civ. P. 1. Requiring Brnovich to file a formal answer or responsive pleading would have served no useful purpose, considering both that the complaint's factual allegations are admittedly undisputed, and that the Court consolidated the preliminary injunction hearing with the trial on the merits at Knox's urging and in order to accommodate her request for expedited relief. Further, Knox was on adequate notice of Brnovich's affirmative defenses, this case was not tried by ambush, and Knox has suffered no prejudice by the absence of a formal responsive pleading. Instead, by eschewing the formalities of standard civil litigation in lieu of a simple briefing schedule, all parties saved time and expense in obtaining resolution of a case that, at its core, presents pure questions of law.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-80\">\n    Notably, Arizona is not the only state that has enacted limitations on who may collect a voter's early ballot.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ind.%20Code%20%C2%A7%203-14-2-16\">\n     Ind.
