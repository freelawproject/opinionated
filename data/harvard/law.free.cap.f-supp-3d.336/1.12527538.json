Furthermore, plaintiff is the exclusive bargaining representative of its union employees at defendant company under a collective bargaining agreement (\"CBA\") including Eufemio D\u00edaz (\"D\u00edaz\"), who worked for defendant in the position of Technician II. On October 11, 2013, D\u00edaz was informed at a meeting with company management that he was dismissed from his employment at Liberty.\n   <strong>\n    ECF Nos. 6-9\n   </strong>\n   at 1;\n   <strong>\n    6-13\n   </strong>\n   .

Article VIII of the CBA also provides that employees who are dismissed for just cause lose their seniority rights.\n   <strong>\n    ECF No. 6-5\n   </strong>\n   at 4.

On June 25, 2015, the arbitrator issued a written decision (\"the award\") construing the pertinent articles of the CBA in light of the parties contentions and concluding that defendant had complied with Articles VIII and XI of the CBA when it dismissed D\u00edaz.\n   <strong>\n    ECF No. 6-3\n   </strong>\n   .

With respect to the issue of seniority presented for our analysis, we must concur with the contention presented by the Company when it indicates to us that the very [CBA] provides that the employee will lose his right to seniority with he is dismissed for just cause; and in the case at issue herein, the reasons why Plaintiff was dismissed have not been questioned by the Union.

Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The Court wholly incorporates by reference herein the above factual summary to avoid needless repetition. In support of its request for vacatur, plaintiff points to three alleged errors by the arbitrator. First, according to plaintiff, the arbitrator's conclusion that defendant had complied with the notification requirements under the CBA when it notified D\u00edaz of his dismissal is contrary to the requirements of the CBA and Puerto Rico Act No. 80, P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 29, \u00a7 185a et. seq. (\"Law 80\"). Specifically, plaintiff avers that the Payroll Maintenance Form was inadequate as a means to notify D\u00edaz of his dismissal, \"since it was insufficient to determine the reasons for the termination and activate the displacement due to seniority mechanism.\"\n   <strong>\n    ECF No. 6-1\n   </strong>\n   at 18. Furthermore, plaintiff asserts that \"the notification was inadequate and insufficient to place the employee [in] a position to prepare his defense given certain facts and certain rules of conduct allegedly violated by [D\u00edaz].\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10520421\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/959/2/#p4\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Defendant asserts that Article XI of the CBA does not establish specific content requirements regarding the notification of dismissal, and neither does Law 80 in relation to private-sector employment.\n   <strong>\n    ECF No. 7\n   </strong>\n   at 9-10. In her award, the arbitrator expounded her interpretation of the CBA's Article XI regarding notification of dismissal, and applying it to the instant case, held that the dismissal notification in question had been sufficient.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <strong>\n    ECF No. 6-3\n   </strong>\n   at 3-7. The Court hereby finds that the arbitrator reasonably construed the aforementioned Article XI of the CBA in relation to question before her. Thus, the arbitrator's interpretation of Article XI and adjudication as to the sufficiency of the notification of D\u00edaz's termination in light of the same do not warrant vacatur under any legal ground.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Second, plaintiff contends that the arbitrator \"erred in concluding that the dismissal was justified and concurring with the Company that the very [CBA] provides that the employee [ ] lost his right to seniority [when] he was dismissed for just cause, when the employer is the one with the burden of proof to support the just cause for the dismissal.\"\n   <strong>\n    ECF No. 6-1\n   </strong>\n   at 7. Defendant asserts that the arbitrator did not adjudicate whether D\u00edaz's dismissal was for just cause, inasmuch as the cause of D\u00edaz's dismissal was never in dispute in this matter, for which the parties voluntarily opted not to submit that issue before the arbitrator.\n   <strong>\n    ECF No. 7\n   </strong>\n   at 1-3, 7-9. Additionally, defendant contends that since the cause for D\u00edaz's dismissal was not in\n   dispute in this arbitration matter, defendant did not carry the burden to establish that D\u00edaz's dismissal was for just cause pursuant to Law 80 precepts.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   As summarized above, the arbitrator expressly stated in the award that the parties did not submit for her consideration the reasons for D\u00edaz's dismissal.\n   <strong>\n    ECF No 6-3\n   </strong>\n   at 7. Accordingly, the arbitrator considered Article VIII of the CBA, highlighted that under the same, an employee loses his/her seniority rights when dismissed for just cause, and held that in the case of D\u00edaz, he had lost his seniority rights upon being dismissed insofar as the cause of his dismissal was not in dispute.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10520421\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/959/2/#p4\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Thus, clearly, the award does not comprise an adjudication as to the cause of D\u00edaz's dismissal, and as such, the arbitrator did not exceed her authority. Moreover, the Court hereby deems as reasonable the arbitrator's interpretation of Article VIII of the CBA as to the question of seniority rights submitted before her in relation to D\u00edaz's dismissal, and holds that there are is no legal justification to vacate her decision in that respect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The third error asserted by plaintiff is that the arbitrator \"erred in not resolving the dispute submitted for her consideration.\"\n   <strong>\n    ECF No. 6-1\n   </strong>\n   at 7. Defendant opposed plaintiff's contention, arguing that \"the controversy presented to the arbitrator was limited to an interpretation of the CBA and was addressed in its entirety.\"\n   <strong>\n    ECF No. 7\n   </strong>\n   at 6-9. This issue does not warrant much discussion-a review of the arbitrator's award evidences a succinct decision that is circumscribed to addressing the issues submitted by the parties for arbitration, as summarized above.\n   <strong>\n    ECF No. 6-3\n   </strong>\n   . Specifically, the arbitrator adjudicated whether defendant \"complied with the provisions of Articles XI and VIII of the [CBA] when dismissing Mr. Eufemio D\u00edaz Hiciano.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10520421\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/959/2/#p4\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10520421\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/959/2/#p4\">\n    at 7\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . And given that the arbitrator concluded that defendant had complied with the provisions of the aforementioned articles, it was unnecessary to adjudicate the second prong of the issue submitted by the parties-the appropriate remedy in case that the arbitrator held that defendant had violated the articles in question. Thus, the third error alleged by plaintiff was not committed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In light of the foregoing, plaintiff's request for review and vacatur of an arbitration award,\n   <strong>\n    ECF No. 6-1,\n   </strong>\n   is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   , and the instant case is\n   <strong>\n    DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE\n   </strong>\n   .

Finally, Subparagraph G provides that any written warning given by a member of management to a union member must be delivered in private and a copy of the same must be given to the delegate and to the Union. The evidence stipulated by the parties clearly shows that the Company complied with the notification requirement when on October 11, 2013, it delivered to Plaintiff the payroll maintenance document, and he signed it as received.
