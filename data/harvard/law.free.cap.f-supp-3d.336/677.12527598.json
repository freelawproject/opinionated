Following a bench trial, and for the reasons explained,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   the court holds that plaintiffs have failed to prove that, were a second Anglo majority district drawn, Anglos would possess the potential to elect an Anglo Republican. In short, this is because the Anglo citizen voting age population (\"CVAP\") of Dallas County contains a significant number of persons (roughly 23%) who vote Democrat. Accordingly, because plaintiffs cannot prevail on their claims under \u00a7 2 of the VRA and the Fourteenth Amendment Equal Protection Clause, defendants are entitled to judgment dismissing this action with prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiffs Anne Harding (\"Harding\"), Gregory R. Jacobs (\"Jacobs\"), Holly Knight Morse (\"Morse\"), and Johannes Peter Schroer (\"Schroer\"), Anglo residents\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   of Dallas County, Texas, bring this suit challenging the 2011 map (\"2011 Map\") for electing commissioners of the Dallas County Commissioners Court (\"Commissioners Court\"). Their claims that were tried are under \u00a7 2 of the VRA and the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, alleging intentional and \"effects\" vote dilution as a result of the redistricting in 2011 of commissioner districts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Dallas County is governed by a Commissioners Court comprised of four county commissioners, who are elected from single member districts, and a county judge, who is elected countywide.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tex. Const. art V, \u00a7 18 (b). Following the 2010 Census, Dallas County Judge Clay Lewis Jenkins (\"Judge Jenkins\") and then-county commissioners Maurine Dickey (\"Commissioner Dickey\"), Mike Cantrell (\"Commissioner Cantrell\"), John Wiley Price (\"Commissioner Price\"), and Dr. Elba Garcia (\"Commissioner Garcia\") determined that it was necessary to redraw district lines because the map drawn after the prior census (the \"Benchmark Map\")\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   had become malapportioned. The Commissioners Court concluded that the Benchmark Map violated the one-person, one-vote requirement of the Equal Protection Clause because Dallas County's population had grown disproportionately in Commissioners Court districts (\"CCDs\") 3 and 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Commissioners Court retained J. Gerald Hebert, Esquire (\"Hebert\") and Rolando L. Rios, Esquire (\"Rios\") as outside redistricting counsel. Hebert, in turn, employed Matt Angle (\"Angle\"), an expert on North Texas geography and demographics, to assist in drawing and presenting redrawn district maps for consideration. During an executive session, the Commissioners Court reviewed the configuration, demographics, and political performance of the Benchmark Map and shared their various redistricting goals (including, for example, Commissioner Dickey's desire that there be a \"conservative,\" or \"Tea Party\" district). They directed Hebert and Rios to draft and present specific redistricting criteria for the Commissioners Court to consider, and they directed Angle to configure demonstration plans for their review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Commissioners Court unanimously adopted Commissioner Precinct Redistricting Criteria (\"Redistricting Criteria\") that they determined \"would help facilitate public participation and help ensure that any adopted redistricting plans will be consistent with all applicable law.\" Ps. Tr. Ex. 15 at 1.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Using the Redistricting Criteria, Angle prepared four demonstration maps that he presented to the Commissioners Court during a closed session meeting. After considering the merits of each, the Commissioners decided to present only one map (\"Map A\"), the predecessor to the map that was ultimately adopted, to the public for consideration. The Commissioners Court then provided notice of, and held a\n   series of, three public hearings related to the redistricting of the CCDs.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   During the redistricting process, Commissioner Dickey, a Republican, announced that she would not seek reelection. Before the Commissioners Court voted on Map A, Commissioner Price contacted Angle and asked him to prepare an amendment that,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , switched the numbering of CCDs 1 and 2 and adjusted the boundaries between CCDs 1 and 2 in the Oak Lawn area in order to place Commissioner Dickey's home in the renumbered CCD 1. As a result of the exchange in district numbers, it was unnecessary for incumbent Commissioner Cantrell to stand for reelection until 2014 (rather than 2012), and Commissioner Dickey's vacated seat was up for election in 2012.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   By a vote of three to one (Commissioner Dickey did not vote), the Commissioners Court adopted the 2011 Map, which Angle had drawn, as the new commissioner districts. The Commissioners Court then submitted the 2011 Map to the U.S. Department of Justice for preclearance under \u00a7 5 of the VRA, which was then still in effect.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The submission stated,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   The new Commissioner Precinct map maintains two current minority opportunity precincts and creates a new minority opportunity precinct in Precinct 1. Specifically, the new map maintains Precinct 3 as an African American opportunity precinct. The African American population is increased in this precinct from 45.6% to 47.9%. Precinct 4 which is currently represented by a Hispanic, who was the candidate of choice of minority voters in 2010, has not been retrogressed. In fact, the current Precinct 4 is 49.3% Hispanic and 65.5% Black plus Hispanic. The new Precinct 4 is 57.9% Hispanic and 72.1% Black plus Hispanic. Precinct 1 is a new minority opportunity precinct. Precinct 1 has a Hispanic population of 48.0% and is 68.4% Black plus Hispanic.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Ps. Tr. Ex. 16 at 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The current composition of the Commissioners Court, elected under the 2011 Map, is as follows: Dr. Theresa Daniel (\"Commissioner Daniel\") (CCD 1, Democrat); Commissioner Cantrell (CCD 2, Republican); Commissioner Price (CCD 3, Democrat); Commissioner Garcia (CCD 4, Democrat); and Judge Jenkins (Democrat). Two of the four commissioners (Commissioners Cantrell and Daniel) are Anglo, as is Judge Jenkins.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Plaintiffs Harding, Jacobs, Schroer, Ray Huebner (\"Huebner\"), and Morgan McComb (\"McComb\")\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   filed this lawsuit against defendants County of Dallas, Texas, Judge Jenkins, and Commissioners\n   Daniel, Cantrell, Price, and Garcia,\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   alleging claims under \u00a7 2 of the VRA and under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.

At trial, plaintiffs proved that the voting power of Anglos residing in CCD 2-including plaintiff Morse-has been \"wasted\" under the 2011 Map because 42.7% of the Dallas County Anglo CVAP, according to the 2010 Census, is \"packed\" into CCD 2, creating an Anglo supermajority (under the 2011 Map, 69.8 % of CCD 2's CVAP is Anglo) that is well beyond the number needed for an Anglo-preferred candidate to be elected. Plaintiffs have also established that the voting strength of Anglos residing on CCDs 1, 3, and 4-including plaintiffs Harding, Jacobs, and Schroer-is diluted because the remaining 57.2 % of the Dallas County Anglo CVAP is \"cracked\" across the remaining CCDs (21.7 % in CCD 1, 17.3 % in CCD 3, and 18.2 % in CCD 4), spreading the remaining Anglo voters sufficiently thin to prevent them from ever electing their preferred candidates.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gill\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612324\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1916/#p1931\">\n    138 S.Ct. at 1935\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Kagan, J., concurring).

Because the\n   <em>\n    Gill\n   </em>\n   plaintiffs failed to produce district-specific evidence that their individual voting strength had been diluted as a result of the districting plan at issue, the Court held that they had failed to prove an \"individual and personal injury of the kind required for Article III standing.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612324\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1916/#p1931\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612324\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1916/#p1931\">\n    at 1931\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   By contrast, as explained above, the plaintiffs in the instant case have alleged\n   <em>\n    and proved\n   </em>\n   that they are Anglos and that each resides in a district where, as a result of alleged \"cracking and packing,\" the voting strength of the Anglo CVAP has been diluted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   D\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Defendants also maintain that plaintiffs cannot meet the \"redressability\" requirement of constitutional standing. They posit that because plaintiffs' \"proposed plan would\n   <em>\n    reduce\n   </em>\n   their opportunities to elect their candidates of choice (Republicans), ... the relief they seek would not redress their (nonexistent) injuries.\" Ds. Post-Trial Br. 9. Defendants' argument, however, goes to the\n   <em>\n    merits\n   </em>\n   of plaintiffs' claims rather than to the ability of the court to redress plaintiffs' alleged injury. Plaintiffs have established a judicially cognizable injury-that the 2011 Map dilutes the strength of their vote through the cracking and packing of Anglo Dallas County CVAP-that is capable of being redressed by the relief they seek: a declaration that the 2011 Map is unconstitutional and violates the VRA, and an injunction prohibiting defendants from implementing the 2011 Map and requiring defendants or the court to create a replacement map that contains a second Anglo-opportunity CCD.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Three Expo Events, L.L.C. v.

Although the court concludes below that plaintiffs' vote dilution claims fail on the merits, it nevertheless holds that plaintiffs have sufficiently established an injury-in-fact for standing purposes by pleading a judicially cognizable injury, i.e. vote dilution, and by adducing evidence that the Anglo population has been dispersed unevenly (concentrated in CCD 2 and spread out among the other CCDs) throughout the four CCDs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   But even if the court is in error in holding that plaintiffs have proved Article III standing, the outcome of this case is the same.

In creating these two Anglo opportunity districts, however, plaintiffs have failed to account for the undisputed facts that roughly 23% of Dallas County's Anglo population votes for Democrat candidates and that a large portion of these Anglo Democrats reside in Remedial Plan districts 2 and 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Defendants' expert, Angle, concludes in his October 13, 2017 Report (\"Rebuttal Report\")\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   that plaintiffs cannot show that the two Anglo majority districts they propose (i.e. Remedial Plan districts 2 and 4\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   ) will provide a legitimate opportunity to elect two Republicans. This is because although Remedial Plan districts 2 and 4 have a majority Anglo CVAP, the configurations of the districts include neighborhoods that are not reliably Republican, with both Anglo and minority voting populations that may support minority-preferred Democrat candidates.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Angle begins with Remedial Plan district 2, explaining that rather than extending east along the northern boundary of Dallas County, taking in reliably Republican neighborhoods before moving south to pick up north Dallas and the Park Cities, Remedial Plan district 2 includes the Democrat neighborhoods around Love Field, south Richardson, Hamilton Park, and Oak Lawn. The proposed district removes approximately 219,258 persons from current CCD 2, 46.5% of whom supported Democrat candidate Hillary Clinton (\"Secretary Clinton\") for President in the 2016 General Election, and 43.9% of whom supported Democrat candidate Lupe Valdez (\"Sheriff Valdez\") for Sheriff in the 2016 General Election. And it adds approximately 260,209 persons who were not included in current CCD 1, 67.7% of whom supported\n   Secretary Clinton in the 2016 General Election and 63.3% of whom supported Sheriff Valdez in the 2016 General Election.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Plaintiffs' other proposed Anglo district, Remedial Plan district 4, begins in the relatively strong Republican area of north Richardson, but extends south to include nearly all of the marginally Democrat suburb of Mesquite, west to include the strongly Democrat city of Balch Springs, and westward to I-45, picking up parts of the Democrat suburbs of Wilmer and Hutchins. In configuring Remedial Plan district 4, plaintiffs have removed approximately 354,831 persons from current CCD 2.

However, the changes to district 2 proposed by Morrison represent a clear retrogression, creating a district that Anglos would be in jeopardy of losing and, as importantly, failing to protect the incumbent, a traditional redistricting principle historically allowed by the courts and followed by Dallas County. For example, under the current district boundaries, Republican Donald Trump carried District 2 in 2016 49.2% to 45.9% over Democrat Hillary Clinton. However, under the districting plan proposed by Morrison[,] Trump would have lost the district to Clinton (46.4% for Trump and 49.4% for Clinton). This change from winning the district by 3 points, to losing the district by 3 points is a clear retrogression to Anglo voting strength in District 2 (Cantrell). In the 2016 County Judge race, Natinsky won 60.2% of the votes. However, under the new redistricting proposal submitted by Morrison the percent for the Anglo-preferred Natinsky drops to 55.7%, more evidence of retrogression.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Ds.

Defendants argue, and the court agrees, that the only evidence the court has before it shows that doing this results in two districts that will likely perform for Democrats. Simply put, although there may be a sufficient number of Anglos residing in Dallas County to draw two districts with Anglo CVAP majorities, because approximately 23% of Anglos in the county typically support Democrats, and because all Anglos are not concentrated in one area of the County, dividing up the Anglo population that is concentrated in north Dallas County between two districts in an area where Democrat-leaning African American and Hispanic voters also live results in two districts that are likely to elect Democrats.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   3\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Plaintiffs contend that they do not have to prove \"functionality\" in order to prevail on their \u00a7 2 claim, but, instead, they only have to show that an alternate map could be drawn that \"guarantees the right of equal access without dilution.\" Closing Arguments Tr. 27.

They criticize defendants for relying on exogenous election data (i.e., the 2016 General Election) to show that creating a second Anglo opportunity district would not give Dallas County Anglos an opportunity to elect a second Republican to the Commissioners Court if the district lines were redrawn. Plaintiffs maintain that regardless whether Secretary Clinton would have carried a redrawn district in the 2016 General Election, this \"has nothing to do with the Commissioners Court level of government,\" and that \"[i]t is possible for somebody at one level of government to win from one political party but in that same area for a person to be represented by a member of a different political party at another level of government.\" Closing Arguments Tr. 24.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   The results of Dr. Hood's analysis are set out above.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 III(B)(3).

With respect to CCD 1, however, Anglo support for Republican candidates has been significantly lower, ranging from 62% to 70.8%, with a mean of 66.4%; Anglo support for Democrat candidates has ranged from 29.2% to 30.8%, with a mean of 33.6%. Plaintiffs rely on these election results to demonstrate Anglo cohesiveness. And perhaps they do show that Anglos as a whole (or at least Anglos in CCDs 3 and 4)\n   <em>\n    do\n   </em>\n   vote cohesively. But the election results on which Dr. Hood relies fail to take into account the geographical dispersion of Anglo Democrats and the high concentration of these types of voters in the neighborhoods plaintiffs would include in their proposed \"Anglo opportunity\" districts. If the Anglos whom plaintiffs are using to create majorities in their proposed \"Anglo opportunity\" districts (districts 2 and 4 in Dr. Morrison's Remedial Plan) are the 12.7% of Anglos residing in CCDs 3 and 4 who prefer Democrat Commissioners Court candidates and the 33.6% of Anglos residing in CCD 1 who prefer Democrat candidates, and if the Republican Anglos are split between two districts, each of which also includes African American and Hispanic populations who reliably vote for Democrat candidates, the \"Anglo opportunity\" districts plaintiffs have created in their Remedial Plan will not, in fact, provide Republican Anglos with any meaningful opportunity to elect Republicans to the Commissioners Court.
