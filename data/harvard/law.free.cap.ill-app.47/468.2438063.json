B. R. Burroughs, Judge, presiding.</summary><summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b464-12\" pgmap=\"464(86) 465(42)\">In 1874, Andrew T. Hawley, the appellant, ^old to John Kettlewell, whose estate is the appellee herein, a tract of land in Madison County, Illinois, and took in payment therefor four notes of \u00a71,000 each, secured by a deed of trust on the land sold. As is shown by the evidence, and from the notes themselves, Kettlewell made payments on the said notes from time to time. In 1886, the trustee in the said trust deed and plaintiff made a release deed to said John Kettlewell, releasing the tract of land embraced in the trust deed from the lien of said incumbrance, and the plaintiff also then delivered the four notes to Kettlewell. What passed between the parties to this transaction at that time is not known.</summary><summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b465-4\" pgmap=\"465\">Kettlewell died in 1890, and Marion T. Kettlewell, his son, was appointed the administrator of his estate by the County Court of Madison County. The plaintiff filed his claim against the said estate, stating there was due to him a balance of 0191.28, after allowing the credit of 0100 paid to him by Kettlewell on November 17,1889. The trial before a jury in the County Court resulted in a verdict for the estate. The case was appealed to the Circuit Court where the claim was disallowed by the jury, and the plaintiff has brought the case to this court, and asks for a reversal of the judgment of the court below.</summary><summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b465-5\" pgmap=\"465\">The plaintiff contends that when, in 1886, after,the said John Kettlewell had been paying on the notes for twelve years, two years after the last one became due, that he, the said plaintiff, agreed to release the land and give Kettlewell his notes, and to allow Kettlewell to pay the small balance due at his own convenience, and that in 1887, a year after the notes were given up, Kettlewell had figured up the exact amount due. In support of this contention the plaintiff proved, on the trial by Jonathan Quarton, who is a justice of the peace, and who knew Kettlewell and had done business for him, that the decedent, Kettlewell, came to him in the latter part of 1887, and stated that he, Kettlewell, wanted to make a settlement with Mr. Hawley; that it was on some notes, and he did not know how much was due to Hawley. Kettlewell was unable to read or write and the witness testified that he agreed to compute the amount due for him. Kettlewell left a memorandum of the original amount and the payments he had made with the witness, and stated that it was a correct memorandum, and thereupon the witness figured up what was due, finding that it was 0296.99, and he so reported to Kettlewell, who said that it was satisfactory to him but did not say he was going to pay the amount. The amount was computed to November 17, 1887.</summary><summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b466-3\" pgmap=\"466\">The plaintiff also proved by A. T. Hawley, Jr., that the decedent, Kettlewell, came to his father\u2019s house in November, 1889, and paid some interest, and also $100; that he knows that Kettlewell owed his father a balance from what his father told him, and knows that the said $100 was paid on it. In corroboration of the statement of this witness, there was introduced in evidence a certificate, of deposit of the Alton National Bank, of date October 1, 1888, which he thinks Kettlewell gave to him as the $100 payment made at this time. The plaintiff also sought to show by the witness Dexter Ferguson, that he, too, had computed the amount due in November, 1887, but the court ruled out the testimony on the ground that the computation was not made from the notes or from memoranda furnished by the decedent, of which ruling no complaint is made in the argument. The estate rested its defense on the possession of the notes and release deed, which were allowed in evidence, and on the testimony of one S. Midgley, who swore that the plaintiff told him in 1889 that Kettlewell did not now owe him (the plaintiff) one cent. The plaintiff, who was a competent witness for that purpose, denied that he had made any such statement to Midgley.</summary><attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b466-4\" pgmap=\"466\">Mr. H.

There is no evidence in this record that at the time of the surrender of the notes, Kettlewell agreed to pay Hawley any balance. In fact, there is no evidence of an agreement to pay Hawley any money after the surrender of the notes. This question was propounded to Quarton: \u201c Did Mr. Kettlewell ever say anything to you about paying anything to Mr. Hawley ?\u201d A. \u201cI don\u2019t know whether he did or not.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b467-6\" pgmap=\"467\">When it is claimed Kettlewell paid some money and delivered a certif\u00edcate of deposit for \u00a7100 to Hawley, Jr., in November, 1889, he did not say what it was for, or that he would pay any more money. What Hawley, Jr., said on that subject, were his own conclusions or statements, made on information derived from his father.</p> <p id=\"b467-7\" pgmap=\"467(148) 468(22)\">While the appellant doubtless honestly believes that he has a legal and just claim against the estate of Kettlewell, yet under the evidence in this record, showing the voluntary surrender of the notes, under no claimed misapprehension or mistake, we do not .believe another jury will look with any degree of favor on the presentation of the claim for a balance due on such notes, after his old friend and neighbor had died. Two juries and courts have passed upon the facts in this case; they were brought face to face with the witnesses. It was for the jury to say whom they would believe, and as the question involved was wholly one of fact we are not disposed, especially in view of the peculiarity of this claim, to disturb the verdict or the judgment of the court below thereon. We have examined the instruction. offered on behalf of the plaintiff and refused by the court, of which refusal complaint is made in the argument.</p> <p id=\"b468-6\" pgmap=\"468\">The instruction refused was in substance given in another instruction. There being no error in the record, the judgment is affirmed.</p> <p id=\"b468-14\" pgmap=\"468\">Judgment affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
