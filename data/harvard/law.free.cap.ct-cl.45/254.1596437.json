The acts 1861, 1862 should be given a liberal construction, but not such as would defeat the legislative intent, which was that the State should be reimbursed only for \u201c <em>expenses properly incurred, \u201d </em>in equipping troops, reserving to the accounting officers the right to determine whether such expenses had been properly incurred.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b281-10\">V.The States raising and equipping troops for the suppression of the rebellion acted as agents of the United States, but could not go beyond the limit of their agency as defined by the terms of the statutes under which they acted.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b281-11\">VI.The Treasury rules for the settlement of such claims, contemporaneous with the statutes, provided that \u201c <em>bounties or donations to men or their families to mduce men to volunteer will not be recognized.\" </em>This is a construction given to the acts 1861, 1862 which has been adhered to for nearly fifty years, and should not be overthrown except for cogent reasons.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b281-12\">VII.Extra pay is something additional to the regular pay and allowances authorized by Congress, and. comes within the prohibition of \u201c <em>bounties </em>\u201d in the rules, and is not an expense properly incurred.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b281-13\">VIII.Where an expense incurred has been allowed by the accounting officers as \u201c <em>properly incurred </em>\u201d the State is entitled to interest paid on money borrowed for that expense.

On the hearing, not only the motion, but the whole case was argued by counsel.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b282-5\"><em>Mr. Jackson H.

This latter has been the rule erroneously adopted by the accounting officers of the Treasury Department, and gave rise to the controverted question of law upon which the present case has been referred to this court for determination.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b282-7\">In the <em>New York case </em>the vital question was rather one of whether the expenditures for interest charges were so directly connected with the cost of recruiting that they might be allowed under the act of July 27, 1861. For that reason perhaps the question did not arise in that case as to the conclusiveness of the State\u2019s judgment upon the necessity or propriety of a given item of expense.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b282-8\">It is interesting and necessary in the present case to analyze the act of Congress of July 27, 1861, to determine the exact status of the State thereunder and its precise relation to the General Government.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b282-9\">The first clause of the act\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b282-10\"><em>\u201cBe it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress </em>assembled, That the Secretary of the Treasury be, and he is hereby, directed, out of any money in the Treasury.not otherwise appropriated, to pay to \u201d\u2014 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>is the usual formula found at the beginning of every appropriation bill, and the reference therein to the Secretary of the Treasury can not be considered to contemplate more than the authority granted that officer to direct the disbursement of a portion of the government moneys upon the issuance of the proper warrant. To hold that this confers any special powers would be to put a strained and forced meaning to words that have acquired for many years a certain fixed and definite meaning.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b283-4\">The remainder of the statute, with which we are most concerned, designates what shall be paid \u2014 the costs, charges, and expenses properly incurred by such State for enrolling, paying, etc., its troops \u2014 employed in aiding to suppress the rebellion \u201cto be settled upon proper vouchers, to be filed and passed upon by the proper accounting officers of the Treasury.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b283-5\">As the Supreme Court has declared, this statute made the State the agent of the United States for the purposes named.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b283-6\">The statute is remarkable from the importance of the subject-matter and the absence of any restrictions defining the manner in which the agent is to proceed or the character or amount of expenditures to be incurred. The absence of such restrictions plainly implies that judgment and discretion shall be exercised on the part of some one. \u2022</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b283-7\">In incurring and paying these expenses the State is not given the protection of being placed under the guidance or direction of any department or officer. The only protection afforded is the direction of the act that the costs, charges, and expenses \u201cproperly incurred\u201d for the purposes named shall be repaid \u2014 not merely a contract, but a compact of indemnity. Until it has incurred the expense, paid and received its voucher for the amount due, and filed its voucher with the accounting officers of the Treasury Department, it has acted solely upon its own judgment and discretion in incurring and paying \u201c proper \u201d expenses.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b283-8\">Would it be giving to the act the intent declared by the Supreme Court in the New York case to hold that the judgment of the State upon such a question is subject to be re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>viewed and reversed by the accounting officers without a positive direction from Congress to that effect?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b284-4\">The State under the act of 1861 was <em>fro hao vice </em>the agent of the United States and coordinate with the War Department. It was created by Congress a direct agency to perform duties properly belonging to that department. The necessities of the occasion required the exercise of broad and discretionary powers. It would be absurd to believe that Congress intended this agency to be subject in its most vital point \u2014 the securing of recruits \u2014 to limitations to which the War Department would not be subject.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b284-5\">The reference to the filing of vouchers to be \u201c passed upon by proper accounting officers of the Treasury \u201d is not a special provision of law in this act, but the counterpart of the provision relating to all executive departments. (Rev. Stat., sec. 277.) The construction by the courts of the rights and duties of the accounting officers is directly applicable.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b284-6\">A leading case upon this subject is that of the <em>United States </em>v. <em>Johnson </em>(124 U. S., 286).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b284-7\">In the case of the <em>United States </em>v. <em>Jones </em>(59 U. S. R., 96) the question arose directly upon the refusal of the accounting officers to pass in the accounts of Lieutenant Jones the sum of $1,000 allowed him by the Secretary of the Navy for expenses he had incurred in connection with certain injuries accidentally received while on leave of absence in Paris. This money was disbursed for the purpose designated by the Secretary of the Navy. The action of the accounting officers was based upon the fact that there was no statute authorizing the payment of such expenses, and by section 2 of the act of March 3, 1835 (4 Stat. L., 757), then in force, it was provided that no allowance should be made under any circumstances whatsoever to any officer in the naval service except of the allowances provided by that act.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b284-8\">It is shown by the dissenting opinion of Mr. Justice Daniel in this case that there was no express authority of law for making this allowance, which was not within the provisions of the law for the creation and application of the hospital fund. Mr. Justice Grier, however, delivering the opinion of the court, held that the exigencies of the service often required the employment of soldiers and sailors at a distance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>from public hospitals, and when the attendance of the medical officers can not be obtained; consequently, in fulfillment of the humane policy of the Government, it frequently becomes necessary to employ temporarily physicians not regularly commissioned. For in this way alone can the department perform the duty assumed by the Government of providing the necessary medical attendance for those who become sick or disabled in its service.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b285-4\">The duties of the accounting officers in passing upon allowances made by executive officers in the discharge of their duties imposed by law are fully considered in the cases of <em>McKnight </em>v. <em>United.States </em>(13 C. Cls. E., 292, 309) and <em>Barnett </em>v. <em>United States </em>(16 C. Cls. E., 516).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b285-5\">Eeturning now to the act of July 27, 1861, we find that the accounting officers have been given no greater powers than are properly exercised by an auditor in the statement of accounts upon vouchers submitted; that no officer or department is designated to pass upon the propriety of the state\u2019s action in incurring the expenses incident to recruiting. This brings us directly to principles of general law to determine by what authority this question must be determined. We have seen from the direction of the Secretary of War to the State of New York, cited by Mr. Justice Harlan in the case of <em>New Torh </em>v. <em>United States {supra), </em>that the War Department did not attempt to define what measures should be adopted, but requested the adoption by the State of such means as were necessary to obtain the desired end, to wit, the securing of recruits. The term \u201c necessary \u201d in this connection is but a synonym for \u201c proper,\u201d and this contemporaneous construction of the statute shows that the Secretary of War devolved upon the State the duty of determining what was proper.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b285-6\">The rule of agency whereby the right of the agent to do those things necessary to the proper execution of the purpose of his appointment has been expressed in Story on Agency, as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b285-7\">\u201cWhether the authority be expressed or implied it necessarily carries with it, or includes in it as an incident, all the powers which are necessary or proper or usual as means to effectuate the purposes for which the agency was created.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b286-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>This rule has been quoted with approval and cited as authority in numerous cases.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b286-4\">The State of Nevada was, under stress of public necessity, clothed with the authority and duties of a public officer, and of necessity there was a certain discretion confided to the State.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b286-5\">As has been stated by Judge Story in <em>Allen </em>v. <em>Blunt </em>(Fed. Cas. No. 216; 3 Story, 746):</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b286-6\">\u201c When a particular authority is confided to a public officer to be exercised upon an examination of the facts of which he is made the appropriate judge, his' decision upon the facts in the absence of any controlling provision is absolutely conclusive as to the existence of those facts.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b286-7\">In the case of <em>Luther </em>v. <em>Borden </em>(7 How., 1) one of the questions decided related to the action of the President under the act of February 28, 1795, giving to him the authority in case of insurrection in any State against the government thereof, on application of the legislature or chief executive when the legislature can not be convened, to call out the militia of any other State or States to suppress such insurrection.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b286-8\">The court held that the action of the President in determining all of the collateral questions incident to the execution of his duty under the act of Congress above referred to conclusively decided those questions in so far as all collateral attack was concerned. The general rule defined in this case may be found in the following quotation from the opinion:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b286-9\">\u201c Whenever a statute gives a discretionary power to any person to be exercised by him upon his own information of certain facts, it is a sound rule of construction that the statute constitutes him the sole and exclusive judge of the existence of those facts.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b286-10\">Comparison of the wording of the act of July 27, 1861, with the general rule of liability of a principal to reimburse his agent for expenses incident to his acts under an authority granted shows that, in making the provisions for indemnity Congress merely affirmed as to the agency created under that act the general law of agency. Had Congress merely authorized and permitted the State to act as agent for the United States in enrolling, subsisting, etc., troops, the State would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>have been entitled to reimbursement and the measure of responsibility would have been identical with that stated by Congress in the act; that is, for costs, charges, and expenses properly incurred. The general principle defined in the leading cases is stated in the American and English Encyclopedia of Law (2d ed., vol. 1, p. 1117) as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b287-4\">\u201c The agent is entitled to reimbursement from, his principal for all advances and expenses made and incurred in carrying into effect the purposes of employment not in violation of the policy of law.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b287-5\">\u201cWhere, however, an agent makes expenditures in the principal\u2019s business which might have been avoided by ordinary diligence or which are unauthorized, he is without remedy against his principal.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b287-6\">We submit, therefore, that the State of Nevada, having in good faith paid for the use and benefit of the United States the moneys involved in this claim, is entitled, under the ordinary rules of law and justice, to the benefit of its determination of the necessity for these expenditures.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b287-7\">We might advert to the fact that there is an additional consideration which should induce the court to consider such matters of judgment and discretion as properly left to the decision of the State.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b287-8\">Congress in selecting the States to perform the duties of this agency evidently considered the fact that it was not dealing with an ordinary agent or constitutional officer subject to the usual temptations and frailties of individuals, which it has been the wisdom of the law to guard against in the dealings of the United States through its public officers. Had Congress passed an act authorizing the appointment of private individuals as agents for the purposes named, it would undoubtedly have placed them under the authority of some executive officer and specified fully the conditions and limitations under which the agency should be accepted and executed. The significant absence of such provisions in the act under which the State of Nevada made these disbursements should receive careful consideration. The good faith of the state legislature in directing the incurring of these expenses must be presumed and can only be rebutted upon the most cogent proof of an improper motive.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b288-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>It is claimed by the State that the disbursements made were for the purpose of securing the requisite number of troops, and in the numerous investigations made under the direction of Congress by the War and Treasury departments and in congressional reports and debates the truth of this assertion has never been questioned. The fact that Nevada passed its act of March 11,1865, under which these disbursements were made, upon the suggestion of the military officer of the United States commanding the Department of the Pacific, should, we think, be accepted by the court as conclusive evidence of the existence, first, of a pressing need for the services of additional recruits, and, second, of the necessity for providing such measures in order to secure these recruits. For this reason we refrain from a detailed discussion of the local conditions, the existence of which is established in the official correspondence of the War Department, a printed transcript of which is among the papers transmitted from the Treasury Department with this case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b288-4\">The scope of the powers of the commanding officer of a military department was considered in the cases arising under contracts made by Major-General Fremont, commanding the Western Department during the early part of the civil war. While those cases have no bearing upon the present case in so far as the validity of the exercise of powers under the act of 1861 by the State of Nevada is to be considered, they are important in defining the authority of the officer commanding the department to determine the existence of a public exigency. <em>(Stevens </em>v. <em>United </em>States, 2 C. Cls. R., 95.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b288-5\">The troops raised by Nevada through the measures provided by its legislature were, with full knowledge on the part of General Wright, accepted for the service of the United States, mustered into that service, and actually employed in the common defense. This court, first in the Fremont contract cases, and subsequently in many cases, has held that the acceptance of a benefit by the United States creates an obligation to make compensation, which can be enforced by suit. <em>(Reeside </em>v. <em>\u00fc.

It speaks and acts only through agents, or, more properly, officers.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b289-9\">The officers of the Government are public agents. Their acts may be inquired into \u2014 be reviewed and corrected. (See <em>Floyd Acceptances, supra.) </em>And unless it manifestly appears that they were acting within the scope of their authority the Government is not liable. <em>(Whiteside </em>v. <em>United States, </em>93 U. S., 247,257; <em>Rawlcins </em>v. <em>United States, </em>96 U. S., 689, 692, 693.) It can not be denied that when a State acts as the agent of the United States it belongs to the category of public agents. Consequently when it so acts its authority is defined and limited by the federal statutes, and the liability of the Government for its acts is determined by the principles applicable to transactions between public agents and the Government. If, therefore, the Government could not be held liable for the claim in question, provided the expenditures represented thereby had been incurred by its officers, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>who are public agents, then it can not be held liable' to claimant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b290-4\">In view of counsel\u2019s admission, viz: \u201cAll of the disbursements embraced in this claim were made pursuant to legislative acts,\u201d and in view of their failure to deny the following statement contained in the comptroller\u2019s letter of September 30, 1903, page 18, viz: \u201cThe troops of Nevada received from the United States the full pay and allowances of regular officers and enlisted men for the years 1863, 1864, 1865, and 1866,\u201d it would seem to be unnecessary to establish the proposition that no officer of the Government had authority to incur the expenditures in question.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b290-5\">The contention of counsel, however, seems to be based mainly upon the proposition that the said act of July 27, 1861, impliedly empowered the States solely to determine what expenses were necessary to incur in order to aid in the suppression of insurrection; to borrow money on the credit of the United States for such purpose; and to contract to pay interest thereon at a rate to be determined by them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b290-6\">Counsel for defendant insists that such contention is not tenable, for the reason that the proposition upon which it is based is unsound.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b290-7\">In view of defendant\u2019s concessions, but two questions need be considered in order to ascertain the soundness of claimant\u2019s main proposition and to determine the correct answer, to be given to the main question now before the court. These questions are:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b290-8\">1. Whether for money necessarily borrowed and properly expended by a State under the act of July 27, 1861 (supra), the Government is liable to reimburse the State at a rate exceeding 7.3 per cent per annum.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b290-9\">2. Whether said act empowered a State to pay bounties to officers and extra pay to enlisted men other than as authorized by acts of Congress to be paid by officers of the Government.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b290-10\">In regard to the first question it would seem from the acts of July 27,1861, and August 5,1861 (12 Stat., 259-313), that the officers of the Government, as its agents, were not authorized to pay more than 7.3 per cent per annum as inter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>est on money borrowed to be used in tbe suppression of the civil war. There is nothing in the said act relied upon by counsel which empowers a State, as agent of the Government, to pay more than Y.3 per cent per annum. It would therefore seem to follow that a State, as agent, was restricted to Y.3 per cent per annum, so far as the liability of the Government is concerned. There is nothing in the opinion of the Supreme Court of the United States in the <em>New York case </em>which conflicts with this view.

If these duties were ministerial and not judicial in character, then in the event that the accounting officers refused to allow the accounts presented by the governor of a State for expenses alleged to have been incurred to aid in suppressing insurrection, or the Secretary of the Treasury refused to pay the same, the State could have successfully resorted to the extraordinary proceedings by way of mandamus to compel said officers to allow, and the Secretary of the Treasury \u201c out <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>of any money not otherwise appropriated, to pay the governor \u201d of such State said accounts so presented by him. <em>(Kendall </em>v. <em>Stohes, </em>12 Pet., 524; <em>Roberts </em>v. <em>United </em>States, 176-U.

If such duties were of the latter class, obviously the State did not have the sole power to determine what expenses were necessary and proper to be incurred. It is respectfully submitted that the duties of the officers of the Treasury enjoined by the act were judicial and not merely ministerial in character. (See <em>Mississippi </em>v.

And by comparing the duties enjoined upon the officers of the Treasury Department by the said act of July 27,1861, with the duties which were enjoined upon Seaman and upon Windom, as seen in their cases, and which w\u2018ere held not to be ministerial in character, it becomes apparent that the duties of the Treasury officials under said act were of a judicial nature.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"81\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b294-4\">The fact that no application has ever been made by any State to compel, by mandamus proceedings, the allowance and payment of any claim or part of a claim presented under said act, and the further fact that \u201c occasions have not been wanting,\u201d would seem to indicate that in \u201c the general judgment of the profession \u201d the duties of the officers of the Treasury Department under said act were judicial in their nature, and that an application for a mandamus against such officers Avould not have been entertained by the courts. (See <em>Mississippi </em>v. Johnson, <em>supra, </em>500.) If the duties of such officers under said act were not of a ministerial character, then manifestly they had the power to review the acts of the respective States in incurring the expenses presented by them for allowance and to determine whether such expenses had been properly incurred.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"82\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b294-5\">But should it be conceded that said act does attempt to confer upon a State the power claimed by counsel for claimant, then to this extent it would be invalid, for the reason that by Article I, section 8, of the Federal Constitution, Congress is given the power by legislation \u201cto lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts, and excises, to pay the debts and provide for the common defense; \u201d also \u201c to borrow money on the credit of the United States.\u201d This power is an essential attribute of national sovereignty and one that is necessary for the preservation of the nation, and while it may be conceded that for convenience Congress may intrust the exercise of this power to a public agent, yet it is respectfully submitted that the power itself can not be bargained away. (See <em>Illinois </em>v. <em>Illinois Cent. R. R. Go., </em>146 U. S., 387, 453.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"83\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b294-6\">Inasmuch as Congress, under the Constitution, must lay the taxes necessary, and in order to pay the debts which have been contracted to provide for the common defense, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>and to enact laws to provide for the borrowing of money on the credit of the nation, it would be strange' doctrine to hold that it could wholly divest itself, and the officers it has created, of the power to determine what debts were necessarily and properly contracted to provide for the common defense or to delegate to a State the power to absolutely determine upon what conditions money might be borrowed \u201con the credit of the United States.\u201d It would therefore seem that, under the Constitution, Congress must of necessity reserve to itself the power to ultimately pass upon all alleged debts or obligations contracted \u201c to provide for the common defense\u201d for which the nation is liable, although it may, for convenience, intrust the exercise of the power to officers of its own creation or to a State.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"84\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b295-4\">In this connection it is pertinent to state that there is a distinction, frequently overlooked, between the delegation of a power and the delegation of authority to exercise a power. By section 3, Article IY, of the Constitution, Congress is empowered to legislate concerning the territory and the Territories of the United States. <em>(Kansas </em>v. Colorado, 206 U. S., 1.) The power to legislate can not be delegated. <em>(Union Bridge Company, </em>204 U. S., 364, 382, 383.) Ever since the formation of the Government Congress has delegated to territorial legislatures and to other tribunals created by it authority to exercise the power to legislate in respect to the Territories \u00e1nd territory. \u201cAnd,\u201d says the Supreme Court, in <em>Kansas </em>v. <em>Colorado, supra, </em>\u201c certainly, we have no disposition to limit or qualify the expressions which have heretofore fallen from this court in respect thereto.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"85\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b295-5\">The power of a State to levy and collect taxes is a sovereign power to be exercised by the legislative, administered by the executive, and enforced by the judicial department. The States delegate and intrust the exercise of this power to officers of counties, municipalities, townships, and school districts, and have authority to do so. (Dillon Mun. Cor., vol. 2, 2d ed., sec. 741.) But Congress and the States in the instances mentioned retain control of the power. If Congress and the States could not delegate the exercise of the power conferred upon them, the wheels of government, National and State, would stop. If either should cease to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>retain control of such power, confusion would follow, and ultimately anarchy.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"86\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b296-4\">\"VVe do not apprehend that counsel for claimant will contend that in respect to those matters committed to Congress by the Constitution it can absolutely delegate to a State the power to legislate concerning them. On the other hand, counsel for defendant concedes that Congress may enact a law whereby is delegated to a public agent, either individual or State, the \u201cpower to determine some fact or state of things upon which the law makes or intends to make its own action depend.\u201d <em>{JJnion Bridge Company </em>v. <em>United </em>States, 204 U. S., 364, 383.) It is also conceded by defendant\u2019s counsel- that when such fact or state of things have been found by such agent, ordinarily the findings can not be disturbed by the courts. (See <em>Johnson </em>v. Towsley, 13 Wall., 72, 83.) However, the administration of the said act of July 27, 1861, in no manner depended upon the finding of any fact or facts by the State.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"87\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b296-5\">It is difficult to understand upon what principle of law the Government can be held liable for any claim which may have arisen by reason of a request of one or more of its officers, unless such officer or officers were authorized by some act of Congress to make the request. No act of Congress has been cited by counsel for claimant and none exists, so far as defendant is advised, which authorized any military or other officer of the United States to request Nevada to enact laws providing for the payment of bounties to officers or extra pay to enlisted men. And, even though it should be conceded that the Nevada legislature passed the acts to allow the bounties to officers and extra pay to enlisted men, at the request of military officers of the United States commanding the department in which Nevada was situated, we respectfully submit that such request, unless previously authorized or subsequently approved by Congress, is not of binding force upon the Government.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"88\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b296-6\">We also respectfully submit that the Government can not be held responsible for benefits accepted in its behalf by its agents, unless Congress has previously authorized or subsequently sanctioned the same. The liability for benefits accepted is based upon the theory that thereby a contractual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>relation was created between the party which conferred and the party which received the benefits. As between an individual and the Government, or as between a State and the Government, the contractual relation must arise from and be based upon some law of Congress. Unless the authority of the Government\u2019s agent to create the contractual relation can be traced to some act of Congress it does not exist.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"89\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b297-4\">Not only from what has preceded, but from what follows, it is manifest that Congress did not, by the acts of February 14,1902, .and May 27,1902, intend that the accounting officers should allow claimant reimbursement for the money borrowed to pay bounties and extra pay, or any interest on money borrowed and expended for such purposes. That body is presumed to have been cognizant of the construction placed upon said act of July 27, 1861, by the Secretary of the Treasury, Mr. Chase, and that such construction had never been questioned by any State, although several of them had allowed and paid bounties and extra pay, etc., and had not presented any claim or claims therefor to the accounting officers of the Treasury Department.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"90\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b297-5\">Peelle, Ch.

But thereafter by the act of May 27, 1902 (32 Stat.

With his letter he transmits a communication to him from the Comptroller of the Treasury, in which, after setting forth the several claims, their origin and character, he submits to the court for its determination three questions as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">1. Under the act of February 14, 1902 (32 Stat. L., 30), what classes of expenditures should be allowed the State of Nevada, and in what amount?</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">2. Under the act of May 27, 1902 (32 Stat. L., 235, 236), what classes of expenditures should be allowed the State of Nevada, and in what amounts?</p>\n<p id=\"b300-7\">3. And in respect to the interest charges allowable under both acts, \u201cWhat sums properly expended by the State or Territory of Nevada were paid by bonds or from funds realized from the sale of bonds, and what were the expenses in connection therewith and what interest was paid thereon? <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>In short, what was the total amount expended by the State in securing funds for expenditures properly incurred and paid?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b301-4\">Questions 1 and 2, though referring to different acts of Congress, embracing the claims of the Territory, as well as the State of Nevada, are in legal effect the same, as each incorporates and makes part thereof the act of July 27, 1861, as interpreted by the Supreme Court in the case of the State of New York (supra), under which claim is made for reimbursement for expenses incurred under said act. Both acts operate to give the claimant a rehearing in the Treasury Department and a reinvestigation of its claim, and if deemed necessary by the Secretary, he is authorized by both acts to transmit the claim to the Court of Claims for findings of fact or determination of disputed questions of law, or both.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">The third question embraces expenses alleged to have been properly incurred that were paid by bonds, or the proceeds arising therefrom, together with expenses in connection therewith and the interest paid on said bonds. However, whatever claims accrued in favor of the State or Territory of Nevada against the United States accrued, if at all, under the act of July 27, 1861, and not under either of the other acts mentioned, their office being as above mentioned, and to give the State the right to assert a claim for expenses likewise incurred by its predecessor, the Territory of Nevada, thereby placing the Territory on the same basis as the State in respect to such claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">Counsel for the respective parties heretofore joined in a motion for the reference of the case to the auditor to examine and state the account between the United States and the State, and its predecessor, the Territory of Nevada, but action on said motion was suspended until the court had heard and considered the question of law involved under the reference, and for that purpose the motion was placed upon the Law Calendar. The case was heard on December 20, 1909, at which time not only the motion but the whole case was argued and submitted to the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-7\">We have then to consider whether the claims herein for reimbursement are properly chargeable against the United <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>States under the act of July 27, 1861, as amended by said joint resolution of March 8,1862 <em>(supra).</em></p>\n<p id=\"Ajf\">The contention of the claimant is that the expenses incurred by the State were, in effect, in its sovereign capacity, though conceding its agency, and that the amount so expended, in the absence of fraud, is not subject to review by the accounting officers; while, on the other hand, the defendant\u2019s contention is that the claimant, as State or Territory, in incurring the expenses to aid in suppressing the rebellion acted as the agent of the United States; and thus acting, the State was limited by the law the same as other agents or officers of the United States, and that therefore only such \u201c costs, charges, and expenses \u201d as were \u201c properly incurred \u201d by the State or Territory for the purposes set forth in said act are allowable.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">The rules and regulations promulgated by Secretary Chase (afterwards Chief Justice of the United States) for the investigation and reimbursement of expenses under said act provide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-6\">\n<em>uBuies for the preparation and settlement at the Treasury Department, under acts of Congress approved July 17, 1861, and July 27, 1861, of claims for reimbursement of expenses properly incurred by the States, respectively, on account of their troops employed in aiding to suppress the present insurrection against the United States.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-7\">\u201cI.

Nor will any reimbursement be made by the United States of expenses incurred in organizing, equipping, and maintaining troops for state purposes, or home guard, whether called out by state or other local authority, unless such troops were called out and such expenditures incurred at the request or undei the authority of the President or the Secretary of War.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>\u201cIII. Personal expenses of commissioned officers in recruiting their companies prior to their being mustered into service will not be allowed; but commissioned officers may be allowed the same rates for subsistence and quarters (board and lodging) as privates, from the date of enrollment until mustered into service. The necessary and actual traveling expenses of recognized military agents of the State, when accompanied by bills of particulars and receipts for payments, will be refunded.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-4\">\u201cIV. Bills of particulars, with dates and rate of charge, and the receipt of the party to whom payment was made, must, in all cases, be furnished. It is not sufficient to show that a gross amount was expended, still less that sums were turned over to individuals to expend, without evidence showing that they were expended by them, and how they were expended. In short, <em>original vouchers for expenditures of every description </em>must be furnished. The expenditures should be classified, and separate abstracts, with the vouchers, presented for pay, subsistence, clothing, transportation, arms, and equipment, and other expenses; and they should also designate, as far as practicable, the particular regiment or corps on account of which the expenditure was incurred. Claims for pay of troops must be accompanied with complete pay rolls for each corps, properly certified and receipted, the same as are required in the regular service.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-5\">\u201cV. Where subsistence in kind could not be furnished, and expenses were incurred for \u2018 board,\u2019 or \u2018 board and lodging,\u2019 the rates will depend on the section of country where furnished, and the price paid for complete rations at the nearest recruiting station or military post, and in no case will a higher rate be allowed than the amount actually paid. The bills must specify the regiment or company to which the troops so subsisted or quartered belonged, and that rations could not be procured. Bills for lodging will be restricted to cases where there were no tents, and quarters could not be otherwise obtained. Purchases of subsistence in bulk will be paid for at not exceeding the current prices at the place of purchase, provided that the quantities are in proper proportions, or reasonably so, to the number of men according to the rates of allowance in the Subsistence Department. The articles of subsistence must be such only as are recognized in the regular service, or, if other articles are substituted, the cost of the whole must not exceed the regular supplies. Bills for spirituous liquors, treating, expenses of holding elections for officers, will not be recognized or paid.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-6\">\u201cVI. Transportation and quarters for troops at reasonable rates will be paid for. Transportation is restricted to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>the usual routes and modes of conveyance, and excessive quantities will not be recognized. Wagon hire for the transportation of the men themselves will not be sanctioned. Charges for transportation by railroad or other public conveyance must be accompanied by bills of lading in cases of property or supplies; and for troops, the number of men ' with the regiment or corps must be distinctly set forth, and where the same has been done in pursuance of a contract, the contract must accompany the vouchers. The same provisions apply to transportation by vessel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-4\">\u201c VII.

P. Chase,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-9\"><em>\u201cSecretary of the </em>Treasury.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b304-10\">The above rules, which we are advised have from the beginning been applied by the accounting officers, outline the departmental construction of the acts, with the execution of which the Secretary of the Treasury was charged, and as they appear to be 'in harmony with said acts, the construction given thereto must now be upheld, unless there is something in subsequent legislation or in the decision of the Supreme Court in the case of <em>United States </em>v. <em>State of New York </em>(160 U. S., 598) enlarging the liability of the United, States.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-11\">The act of June 27, 1882 (22 Stat. L., 111), authorizing the Secretary of the Treasury to examine and report to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>Congress the amount of claims of Nevada and other States for money expended and indebtedness assumed by said States in <em>repelling invasion </em>and <em>suppressing Indian hostilities </em>between April 15, 1861, and the date of said act, is referred to by the comptroller in his communication to the Secretary transmitted to the court, and particular attention is invited to section 2 of this act, which in effect limits the rate allowed for the service of troops and for supplies, transportation, and other proper expenses that was allowed and paid by the United States for similar services of the same grade and for the same time in the United States Army serving in said States; and also limits the amount of such expenses of troops for the time they were engaged in active service in the field. But said act evidently has no direct application to the present claim and is not material in our view of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"AxPL\">The defendants call attention to the acts of August 4, 1886 (24 Stat. L., 217), and March 9,1899 (80 ibid., 120), the first of which provides for the use of certified copies as evidence of all original papers lost, and confers upon the Secretary of War authority to detail three army officers to assist in examining the claims of the States named in said act of June 27, 1882 (supra). The act of March 9, 1899, provides, as before stated, for the reference of the claim of Nevada to the Secretary of the Treasury for investigation and report to Congress. But neither of these acts in any way changes the liability of the United States as it previously existed under the acts of 1861 and 1862. Hence, as before stated, the sole question of law before the court is whether the expenditures for which claim is made by the State were \u201c properly incurred \u201d within the meaning of the acts of 1861 and 1862.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">The question of the good faith of the State in incurring the expenditures for which it now claims reimbursement; the question of the pressing need of the State for troops during the period of the civil war; the duty of the United States to provide for the common defense, and the benefits which may have accrued to them from troops raised in Nevada to aid in protecting the Pacific coast, may all be conceded without enlarging the liability of the United States under the acts of 1861 and 1862. The commanding officer of the Department <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>of the Pacific, while he could execute the orders of the War Department in calling for troops, could not enlarge the liability of the United States under the acts of 1861 and 1862, whatever authority he may have had as such commander in emergencies independently thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-4\">These acts, as held in the <em>New York case (supra), </em>must be given a liberal construction, not, however, such a construction ' as will defeat the manifest purpose of the acts which Congress, had in view. That is to say, Congress, by the language of the acts, intended to reimburse States for \u201c expenses properly incurred\u201d in equipping troops to aid in suppressing the rebellion, reserving, however, to the Secretary and to the accounting officers of the Treasury the right to determine for themselves whether or not the expenses for which reimbursement was sought had been so incurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">The claimant concedes that all disbursements embraced in its claim \u201cwere made pursuant to legislative acts,\u201d and,-as it asserts, were passed at the instance of the military officer commanding the Department of the Pacific. It appears from the comptroller\u2019s letter \u2014 not controverted by the claimant\u2014 that the enlisted men of Nevada for the years 1863, 1864, 1865, and 1866 received from the United States the full pay and allowances of regular officers and enlisted men of the United States Army for those years and presumably as well any bounty which may have accrued to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">We think it manifest, from the language of the acts of 1861 and 1862 that in so far as the State responded to the proclamation of the President for troops it acted as the agent of the United States; and if so, it follows that the State could not bind the United States outside the terms of the statute under which it acted. The claimant concedes the agency of the State, but insists that it acted in some extraordinary way, being different from an ordinary agent or constitutional officer, and that, therefore, in the absence of fraud, its action is conclusive.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-7\">In the <em>New York case (supra, </em>p. 621), except as to the jurisdiction of the court to render judgment under Revised Statutes, section 1063, and the question of the statute qf limitation, neither of which is material in the present case, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>but a single question was involved, or, as was said by the court, \u201c the only inquiry is whether, within the fair meaning of the latter act, the words \u2018 costs, charges, and' expenses properly incurred\u2019 included interest paid by the State of New York on moneys borrowed for the purpose of raising, subsisting, and supplying troops to be employed in suppressing the rebellion. We have no hesitation in answering this question in the affirmative.\u201d Hence, the interest so paid was allowed not as interest, but, as the court held, because \u201c such interest, when paid, became a principal sum as between the State and the United States; that is, became a part of the aggregate sum properly paid by the State for the United States. The principal and interest so paid constitute a debt from the United States to the State. It is as if the United States had itself borrowed the money through the agency of the State.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b307-4\">The court, in this case, also allowed interest on the money borrowed by the State from the commissioners of the canal fund which had been disallowed by the Court of Claims on the ground that the transaction was entirely between the different departments of the same government, which, in law, was the official act of the same political power; but the Supreme Court, treating it as a trust fund, held that the State should have invested the fund in securities for the benefit of the canal fund, and having diverted the fund to the uses of the United States in equipping troops, the State had therebjr deprived itself of the interest which might otherwise have been realized for the benefit of the canal fund, and for this reason the Supreme Court differed with the Court of Claims and allowed interest, charging against the fund, however, interest which the State had earned on a part of the fund so obtained from the canal fund. The decision of the court in the case of the <em>State of Maine </em>(36 C. Cls., 531, 561) followed that decision and is in strict accord therewith.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">But in the New York case it should be borne in mind that the principal sum upon which interest was allowed had theretofore been audited and paid by the Treasury Department as \u201c expenses properly incurred by said State,\u201d and for that reason the expenses for which said principal sum had been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>incurred were not directly involved in that case, or, as was said by this court in the first paragraph of its opinion (26 C. Cls., 467, 489), \u201c The petition alleges that the defendants became indebted to the claimant, on the 1st day of July, 1862, for money laid out and expended to and for the use of defendants, at their request, in the sum of $3,131,188.02, and of this there has been paid the sum of $3,000,000, leaving a balance due the petitioner of $131,188.02,\u201d which was the exact amount of the judgment in the case as modified by the Supreme Court. Hence that question is open, and until determined in the present case that the principal sum upon which interest is claimed was an expense \u201c properly incurred \u201d by the State, the New York case can have no application.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-4\">To hold that the questions involved were determined by the State, and therefore not subject to review, is to fly in the face of the statute under which the accounting officers have from the beginning exercised the right to examine into such expenditures and determine for themselves what costs, charges, and expenses has been properly incurred by each State, and to that end such costs, charges, and expenses are \u201c to be settled upon proper vouchers, to be filed and passed upon by the proper accounting officers of the Treasury,\u201d as in said act provided. The duties thus to be performed', under the act and the rules prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury, are of a quasi judicial character, as they are to determine whether the expenses for which claim for reimbursement is made were \u201cproperly incurred\u201d and to settle the same upon vouchers to be passed upon by them.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">If Congress had thought the action of the State in incurring the expenses was conclusive on the accounting officers and the courts they would have made an appropriation to pay the claim so reported to them by the Secretary of the Treasury under the act of March 3, 1899 <em>(supra), </em>instead of sending it back to him for further investigation or reference to the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">Now, keeping in mind that the United States paid the troops of Nevada in 1863, 1864, 1865, and 1866 the full pay and allowances of regular officers and enlisted men in the United States Army, and presumably also any bounties that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>may have accrued to them, let us inquire as to the character of the expenditures upon which interest is claimed. The items of the claim set forth show that the principal payments niade by the State were for bounties to commanding officers to secure enlistments and for extra pay to volunteers, upon which sum so paid interest is claimed from May 3, 1867, at rates varying, for different periods, from 5 to 15 per cent.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-4\">Of the other items mentioned in abstracts A, B, E, and F there was, as before stated, allowed under the act of June 27, 1882 <em>(supra), </em>by the Secretary of War, with the approval of the Treasury Department, the sum of $8,559.61, which was paid to the State April 10, 1888, leaving a balance due on abstracts B and E for various expenses and salary of the adjutant-general of said State of $2,192.08.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">The allowance and payment, however, under said act of 1882, the claimant concedes was an inadvertence, as the act clearly applies to expenses incurred in repelling invasions and suppressing Indian hostilities, and was, as the claimant asserts, uniformly so interpreted by the accounting officers. But to the extent of the payment so made those items are out of the case, and whether any further payment shall be made thereon we remit to the accounting officers, suggesting that\u2014 in harmony with this opinion \u2014 whatever ruling has been applied under the acts of 1861 and 1862 in the settlement of like claims in favor of other States, not in conflict with the decision in the New York case, should be adhered to in any settlement made thereof with the claimant.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">By the reimbursement act of July 8,1898 (30 Stat. L., 730), for expenses incurred by the governors of States and Territories in equipping troops for the Spanish war, it was expressly provided that any interest paid by any State or Territory on money borrowed or on sums paid out by them in equipping such troops should not be refunded or paid by the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-7\">In view of the construction placed upon the act of 1861 by the Supreme Court in the New York case, supra, holding that interest paid by a State on money borrowed was an expense \u201c <em>properly </em>incurred,\u201d the act of 1898 may well be considered, not as a limitation upon the payment of interest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>on the principal sum expended under said act of 1861, but as in some measure showing the intention of Congress as to the character of expenditures upon which interest should be allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-4\">The rules set out for the settlement of claims under the acts clearly indicate the character of claims which will be considered and those which will not be, and as well the method of the settlement of such claims by the accounting officers. And by rule 8 it is expressly provided that \u201c bounties or donations to men or their families to induce men to volunteer will not be'recognized,\u201d doubtless for the reason, as therein stated, that \u201c such bounties as majr be authorized by laAv will be paid by the United States directly to the men authorized to receive them.\u201d Thus we have not only a prohibition against the reimbursement of expenses for bounties or donations to induce enlistment, but we have the reason for it, and the reason itself negatives reimbursement for any such expense through the agency of the State. To overthrow the construction thus given to the act, which has been adhered to for nearly fifty years, would in effect be overruling the Supreme Court, in many cases holding that the contemporaneous construction of an act by an executive officer charged with its execution is entitled to great weight and should not be overthrown except for cogent reasons. <em>(United States </em>v. Tanner, 147 U. S., 661; <em>United States </em>v. Finnell, 185 ibid., 236; <em>Penoyer </em>v. McConnaughy, 140 U. S., 1.)</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">This view is not in conflict with the decision in the <em>New Yorh </em>case, nor is the decision in that case in conflict with the rules so prescribed for the adjustment of such claims. The difficulty grew out of a too narrow application of the rules by the accounting officers soon after the war in not allowing interest on a principal sum found by them to have been properly incurred. The act promised reimbursement to the State for expenses properly incurred, and that, under the act as well as the rules, carried with it interest as a necessary part of the outlay.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">This regulation was not only justified by the act of 1861, but was in harmony with section 9 of the act- of August 3, 1861 (12 Stat. L., 288), whereby Congress abolished the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>three months\u2019 extra pay allowed by the act. of July 5, 1888, for reenlistments, as well as the bounty granted by the third section of the act of June 17, 1850 (9 Stat. L., 438), for enlistments at remote and distant stations and the premium paid for bringing accepted recruits to the rendezvous, and in lieu thereof enacted laws, too well known to cite, providing for bounties to encourage enlistments; but such bounties were paid by the United States directly to those entitled thereto and not through the medium or agency of the States under the reimbursement acts of 1861 and 1862.</p>\n<p id=\"Ai_\">Now, recurring to the claim in this case, men may be induced to volunteer by the promise of extra pay, as well as by the payment of direct bounties. And surely extra pay would fall under the head of bounty or donation to induce such enlistment. In other words, it is something additional to the regular pay and allowances authorized by Congress to officers and enlisted men in the army, and bounties to enlisted men, and, therefore, not an expense \u201cproperly incurred.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">That laws were enacted by the State at the instance of the officer commanding the military department of the Pacific to provide funds with which to meet the expense of volunteers was quite natural and commendable under the conditions existing there both to the officer and the legislature, and may give rise to some equity in favor of the claim; but that can have no legal force in the construction of the act of 1861. Equity is \u201cthe correction of that wherein the law by reason of its universality is deficient; \u201d but where there is a law equity must follow, and hence we are called upon to determine, not the equities of the claim, but the controverted questions of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">It results that in respect to such bounties and donations the interpretation placed upon the acts of 1861 and 1862 by the Secretary of the Treasury \u2014 -now so long adhered to\u2014 must be upheld. Doubtless many, if not all, of the other Northern States offered bounties, donations, or extra pay to induce their citizens to enlist to fill up their respective quotas, called for from time to time by the President, but none of them, we are advised, have filed any such claim for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>reimbursement, and even the present claim was not filed until after the act of June 27, 1882 <em>(supra).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b312-4\">As to the interest claimed on $46,950.12, there is nothing in the record from which the court can determine the character of the expenses for which said principal sum was incurred, though from the claimant\u2019s brief we infer that in some way it was incurred by the Territory of Nevada, but whether to pay expenses properly incurred or for bounties or otherwise-does not apppeaf.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">If, however, said principal sum upon which interest is claimed has heretofore been allowed and paid by the accounting officers as an expense \u201cproperly incurred,\u201d then, under the decision in the New York case, the State is entitled to interest thereon, which interest, when paid, \u201c became a principal sum, as between the State and the United States; that is, became a part of the aggregate sum properly paid by the State for the United States.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">The question as to the rate of interest was not involved in that case, but, as the State was compelled to borrow money, the court said: \u201c It could not have borrowed money, any more than the General Government could have borrowed money, without stipulating to pay such interest as was customary in the commercial world.\u201d From that statement we may conclude that the court at the time had in mind the payment of such rate of \u201cinterest as was customary in the commercial world.\u201d What that rate was is more familiar to the accounting officers than to the court, and as there is no evidence in the case upon which the court could base an opinion, other than the condition historically known to exist on the Pacific coast during the civil war and the rate paid by the United States, the court remits the question to the accounting officers, who, if any interest should be allowed on said sum of $46,750.12, can follow the New York case in applying the rates then customary in the commercial world.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-7\">It follows that the motion to refer the case to the auditor to state the account is overruled, and the case is disposed of on the merits for the guidance of the Treasury Department.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-8\">This opinion will be certified to the accounting officers for their guidance and action.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
