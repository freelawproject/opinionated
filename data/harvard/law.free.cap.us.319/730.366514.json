The petition for writ of certiorari to the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit is granted. The order of that court of May 3,1943, denying for want of jurisdiction \u2014 which we construe to mean want of power to consider on the merits \u2014 the Government\u2019s motion for leave to file a petition for a writ of prohibition and/or a writ of mandamus, is vacated on the authority of <em>Ex </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number><em>parte United States, </em>287 U.
