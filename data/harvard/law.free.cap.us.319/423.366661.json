The application was presented to Mr. Justice Reed, and by him referred to the full Court. Cf. <em>Budlong </em>v. <em>Budlong, </em>296 U. S. 550; <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Lane, </em>232 U. S. 598, 600; Spies v. <em>Illinois, </em>123 U. S. 131, 143; <em>Bess </em>v. <em>West Virginia, </em>308 U. S. 509. A similar application has been denied by the trial judge on the ground, among others, that the section relied on to establish the jurisdiction of this Court has been repealed. 49 F. Supp. 897.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">Stephan was convicted of treason upon a jury trial and sentenced to death. 18 U. S. C. \u00a7 2. The Circuit Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, sitting en banc, affirmed the conviction, 133 F. 2d 87, and after careful consideration of the case we denied certiorari. 318 U. S. 781, rehearing denied, 319 U. S. 783. He now contends that, in addition to the appellate review which he has already obtained, he is entitled to an appeal as of right from the district court directly to this Court, in view of the provisions of 18 U. S. C. \u00a7 681, which in terms authorizes such an appeal \u201cin all cases of conviction of crime the punishment of which provided by law is death, tried before any court of the United States.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b478-7\">This section of the Code has its origin in \u00a7 6 of the Act of February 6, 1889, 25 Stat. 655, 656, which granted a writ of error as of right from this Court to any federal trial court \u201cin all cases of conviction of crime the punishment of which provided by law is death.\u201d This provision preceded the creation of circuit courts of appeals by the Act of March 3, 1891,. 26 Stat. 826. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Rider, </em>163 U. S. 132, 138. Section 5 of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>latter Act provided that appeals be talcen from district courts (or the existing circuit courts) directly to this Court in six specified classes of cases, one of which was \u201cIn cases of conviction of a capital or otherwise infamous <em>crime\u201d; </em>and by \u00a7 6 it was provided that the circuit courts of appeals should exercise appellate jurisdiction \u201cin all cases other than those provided for in the preceding section of this act, unless otherwise provided by law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">The Act of January 20, 1897, 29 Stat. 492, withdrew from this Court and transferred to the circuit courts of appeals appellate jurisdiction in criminal cases not capital. This was accomplished by deleting, from the clause of \u00a7 5 of the Act of March 3, 1891, just quoted, the phrase \u201cor otherwise infamous,\u201d so that the direct appeal to this Court was preserved only \u201cin cases of conviction of a capital crime.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">Section 5 remained in that form until the enactment of the Judicial Code. Act of March 3, 1911, 36 Stat. 1087. Section 238 of the Judicial Code (36 Stat. 1157), which in connection with \u00a7 236 (36 Stat. 1156) defined the jurisdiction of this Court on direct appeals from district courts, set forth the substance of \u00a7 5 of the Act of March 3,1891, except that it omitted the clause providing for appeals from the trial court to this Court \u201cin cases of conviction of a capital crime.\u201d This omission was not accidental, but deliberate, and its purpose was to withdraw the jurisdiction of this Court to entertain a direct appeal from a district court in a capital case. This may be seen from the notes of the Revisers, which state:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-7\">\u201cThe only change made in the section is in striking out the words fin cases of conviction of a capital crime.5 The effect of this is to take from the Supreme Court jurisdiction in capital cases and to transfer the jurisdiction it now possesses to the circuit courts of appeals.\" S. Rep. No. 388, Part 1, 61st Cong., 2d Sess., p. 77; and also H. R. Doc. No. 783, Part 1, 61st Cong., 2d Sess., p. 81.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b480-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>Consistently with this purpose, \u00a7 128 of the Judicial Code provided (36 Stat. 1133) that \u201cThe circuit courts of appeals shall exercise appellate jurisdiction ... in all cases other than those in which appeals and writs of error may be taken direct to the Supreme Court, as provided in section two hundred and thirty-eight, unless otherwise provided by law.\u201d And \u00a7 297 directed (36 Stat. 1169) that \u201call other Acts and parts of Acts, in so far as they are embraced within and superseded by this Act, are hereby repealed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">Such a plain purpose, established both by language of the Judicial Code and its legislative history, cannot be ignored. Our appellate jurisdiction is defined by statute <em>(Ex parte McCardle, </em>7 Wall. 506, 512; <em>The Francis Wright, </em>105 U. S. 381, 386; <em>St. Louis, I. M. &amp; S. Ry. Co. </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>210 U. S. 281, 292) and it is evident that since 1911 the statutes have not authorized a direct appeal to this Court in capital cases. The fact that the words of 18 U. S. C. \u00a7 681 have lingered on in the successive editions of the United States Code is immaterial. By 1 U. S. C. \u00a7 54 (a), the Code establishes \u201cprima facie\u201d the laws of the United States. But the very meaning of \u201cprima facie\u201d is that the Code cannot prevail over the Statutes at Large when the two are inconsistent. Cf. <em>Warner </em>v. <em>Goltra, </em>293 U. S. 155, 161; <em>Cloverleaf Co. </em>v. <em>Patterson, </em>315 U. S. 148, 164, n. 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">Accordingly the application for leave to appeal is denied, and the stay heretofore granted is vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
