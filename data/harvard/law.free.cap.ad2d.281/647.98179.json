Our review of the record, defense counsel\u2019s brief and defendant\u2019s <em>pro se </em>submissions leads us to the same conclusion. Defendant entered a knowing, voluntary and intelligent plea of guilty to the reduced charge of attempted promoting prison contraband in the first degree and was sentenced, as a second felony offender, to a prison term of IV2 to 3 years to run consecutively with the sentence he was then serving. Defendant\u2019s sentence was in full <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>accordance with the negotiated plea agreement and the relevant statutory requirements. The judgment is, accordingly, affirmed and defense counsel\u2019s application for leave to withdraw is granted <em>(see, People v Cruwys, </em>113 AD2d 979, <em>lv denied </em>67 NY2d 650).</p>\n<p id=\"b686-3\">Cardona, P. J., Mercure, Crew III, Carpinello and Mugglin, JJ., concur. Ordered that the judgment is affirmed, and application to be relieved of assignment granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
