The Labor Law \u00a7 241 (6) claim is premised (see <em>gen</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"866\">*866</page-number><em>erally, Ross v Curtis-Palmer Hydro-Elec. Co., </em>81 NY2d 494, 501-505) on defendants\u2019 alleged violation of 12 NYCRR 23-1.7 (d), which provides for protection from slipping hazards, and 12 NYCRR 23-1.24 (a) (1) (i), which requires roofing brackets to be used in certain situations during the performance of work on a roof having a slope steeper than one in four. Both regulations are sufficiently specific to support a Labor Law \u00a7 241 (6) claim <em>{see, Lessard v Niagara Mohawk Power Corp., </em>277 AD2d 941; <em>Stasierowski v Conbow Corp., </em>258 AD2d 914, 915; <em>Rudolph v Hofstra Univ., </em>225 AD2d 680, 681; <em>see generally, Ross v Curtis-Palmer Hydro-Elec. Co., supra, </em>at 502-505). Moreover, both regulations are applicable to the facts of this case and arguably were violated by defendants, thus warranting a trial of the Labor Law \u00a7 241 (6) claim.
