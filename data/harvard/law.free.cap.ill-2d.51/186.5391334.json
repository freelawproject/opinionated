JUSTICE SCHAEFER</author> <p id=\"AdZ\" pgmap=\"197\">delivered the opinion of the court:</p> <p id=\"b197-4\" pgmap=\"197\">In 1968 the defendant, F&amp;B Manufacturing Co., entered into a contract to buy an industrial heat treating furnace from Ipsen Industries, a division of the plaintiff, Aleo Standard Corporation, for a price of $66,595. The contract described the dimensions and other specifications of the furnace. The furnace was delivered to F &amp; B\u2019s plant in Phoenix, Arizona, on or about July 6 of the same year. F&amp;B rejected it on the ground that it was not large enough to meet its needs. By agreement of the parties the defendant paid the cost of shipping the furnace to a warehouse in California, where the plaintiff resold it to another manufacturer for $57,500.</p> <p id=\"b197-5\" pgmap=\"197\">Thereafter the plaintiff brought this action to recover the difference between the contract price and the price for which the furnace was resold. A jury was waived, and after a trial, judgment was entered for the plaintiff in the sum of $9,095. Interest at 5%, in the sum of $505, was also allowed, because payment had been withheld \u201cby unreasonable and vexatious delay.\u201d The Appellate Court Second District, affirmed the judgment for $9,095, and reversed the judgment insofar as it provided for the payment of interest. (Alco Standard Corp. v. F &amp; B Manufacturing Co. (Ill.App. 1970), 265 N.E.2d 507.) We allowed leave to appeal.</p> <p id=\"b197-6\" pgmap=\"197\">In this court the buyer contends that in reselling the rejected furnace, the seller was required to comply with section 2 \u2014 706(3) of the Uniform Commercial Code, but failed to do so. That provision states: \u201cWhere the resale is at private sale the seller must give the buyer reasonable notification of his intention to resell.\u201d Ill.Rev.Stat. 1967, ch. 26, par. 2-706(3).</p> <p id=\"b197-7\" pgmap=\"197(18) 198(34)\">The buyer asserts that before a seller is entitled to recover damages under that section of the Uniform Commercial Code he must prove his compliance with it, and that the appellate court erroneously held that section 2 \u2014 706(3) establishes an affirmative defense, which must be pleaded and proved by the buyer.</p> <p id=\"b198-3\" pgmap=\"198\">The opinion of the appellate court states: \u201cThe defendant was not notified of the proposed resale of the furnace as required-by section 2 \u2014 706(3) of the Commercial Code [citation], and now complains that this failure is a complete defense to the action for the deficiency. Once again, the failure to notify defendant of the resale was not pleaded affirmatively.\u201d These statements strongly suggest a misinterpretation of the statute, which does not require that the defaulting buyer be notified of \u201cthe proposed resale,\u201d but instead requires only that the seller \u201cgive the buyer reasonable notification of his intention to resell.\u201d It is not necessary however to determine the proper allocation of the burden of pleading and proof under the Code for the reason that the testimony is undisputed that the buyer\u2019s plant manager in Phoenix was told by the seller\u2019s west coast manager that there was a potential buyer for the machine in California and the buyer then paid for shipping the machine there. If we assume the buyer\u2019s contention to be correct this is sufficient proof of notice under the provisions of the Code.</p> <p id=\"b198-4\" pgmap=\"198\">The contract of sale provides in part:</p> <blockquote id=\"b198-5\" pgmap=\"198\">\u201cIn the event of the Purchaser\u2019s default *** Ipsen may resell it at public or private sale, and in the case of public sale, Ipsen or any other person may purchase the same and from the proceeds pay the retaking, repairing, storing, selling expenses and attorney\u2019s fees and apply the remaining amount to any balance the Purchaser owes Ipsen and Ipsen may recover any resulting deficiency from the Purchaser as liquidated damages ***.\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b198-6\" pgmap=\"198(40) 199(53)\">The buyer contends that the seller cannot recover the deficiency claimed and argues: \u201cIt is clear that the contract allows plaintiff to resell at public or private sale. There is no dispute that it was a private resale in the instant case. We read the contract to allow recovery for \u2018any balance\u2019 only in the case of public resale. Note carefully the language and punctuation italicized above. If such balance could be recovered at private resale, the words \u2018and in the case of public sale\u2019 are not needed and, indeed, have no meaning.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b199-3\" pgmap=\"199\">This argument is ingenious, but unsound. The argument is admittedly built upon punctuation \u2014 specifically upon the absence of a comma after the provision which states that in the case of a public sale, \u201cIpsen or any other person may purchase the same.\u201d If there was a comma after the word \u201csame,\u201d the buyer\u2019s argument, which in any event makes meaningless the reference to resale at a private sale, would totally collapse. Sensibly read, we think it clear that the quoted provision authorizes resale at public sale, at which the seller may itself purchase, or at private sale. And in either event the seller may recover the difference between the contract price and the resale price.</p> <p id=\"b199-4\" pgmap=\"199(191) 200(36)\">It was agreed in the appellate court that the trial court improperly awarded interest for \u201cvexatious and unreasonable delay.\u201d The seller, however, contends that interest should have been awarded under section 2 of the Interest Act (Ill.Rev.Stat. 1969, ch. 74, par. 2), which provides that creditors shall be allowed to receive interest at five per centum \u201cfor all moneys after they become due on any * * * instrument of writing.\u201d This contention is open to the seller under Rule 318(a) (Ill.Rev.Stat. 1969, ch. 110A, par. 318(a)), and in our opinion it is sound. It has often been held that written contracts for the sales of goods are \u201cwritten instruments\u201d within the meaning of the statute. (Murray v. Doud &amp; Co. (1897), 167 Ill. 368, 375; Laughlin v. Hopkinson (1920), 292 Ill. 80, 85-86; Smith v. Gray (1925), 316 Ill. 488; Keystone Steel and Wire Co. v. Price Iron and Steel Co. (1952), 345 Ill.App. 305, 314-315; see, e.g., In re Morrison (7th cir. 1919), 261 F. 355, and cases cited therein; L. L. Fortes Sportswear Co. v. Goldblatt Bros., Inc. (7th cir. 1966), 356 F.2d 906, 910.) The buyer has suffered no prejudice because the trial court awarded interest on an erroneous ground (Nix v. Thackaberry (1901), 240 Ill. 352, 357), and that portion of the appellate court\u2019s judgment which denied interest is reversed.</p> <p id=\"b200-3\" pgmap=\"200\">Affirmed in part and reversed in part.</p> <p id=\"b200-4\" pgmap=\"200\">MR. JUSTICE DAVIS took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
