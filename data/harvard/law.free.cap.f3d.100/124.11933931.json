After appointing counsel, the district judge <em>sua sponte </em>found that the federal habeas petition was frivolous, set aside the.appointment order under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(a), and thereby prevented payment of the capital petitioner\u2019s attorneys. We REVERSE.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-27\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b225-28\">The petitioner-appellant, Varnall Weeks, was executed on May 12, 1995.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Preceding his execution, Weeks\u2019s attorneys<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> challenged his death sentence in- state and federal court on the basis of his mental incompetence to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>executed.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Because Weeks was indigent, his attorneys represented him without any payment from their client, and they received no compensation for their representation from the State of Alabama. Following the denial of Weeks\u2019s second request for postconviction relief by the Alabama courts, his counsel filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus in federal court in the Middle District of Alabama on May 10, 1995, as well as a motion requesting appointment as counsel under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 848(q) and a motion to proceed <em>in forma </em>pauperis.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> That same day, the district court granted the motions for appointment of counsel and to proceed <em>in forma pauperis, </em>but it denied Weeks\u2019s petition for habeas relief on the merits and denied a stay of execution.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-4\">On May 11, 1995, Weeks\u2019s counsel appealed the district court\u2019s denial of a certificate of probable cause and sought a stay of execution in this court. A majority panel addressed the merits of his ineompetency claim and concluded, based on the factfindings of the state trial judge and the evidence presented at the state evidentiary hearing, that Weeks was not mentally unfit to be executed. <em>Weeks v. Jones, </em>52 F.3d 1559, 1561-62 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 115 S.Ct. 1841, 131 L.Ed.2d 846 (1995). Accordingly, this court denied a stay of execution and a certificate of probable cause. The dissent noted that Weeks\u2019s ease was the first time that our court had addressed the issue of the constitutional standard for competency to be executed. <em>Id. </em>at 1574-75 (Kravitch, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).</p>\n<p id=\"b226-7\">In July, 1995, Weeks\u2019s counsel contacted the district court clerk\u2019s office because they had not yet received their vouchers needed to submit fee requests. On August 2, 1995, the district court <em>sua sponte </em>issued an order setting aside \u25a0 its previous order appointing counsel for Weeks under \u00a7 848(q) \u201cpursuant to Rule 60(a), Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\u201d R2-22-2. In setting aside his former order granting appointment of counsel, the district judge explained his reconsideration resulting in his denying the attorneys\u2019 former motion for appointment of counsel:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ANt\">This Court was recently contacted by Petitioner\u2019s attorneys regarding not having received their CJA 30 Vouchers issued to appointed attorneys in death penalty proceedings. In reviewing the file, this Court found on May 10, 1995, it erroneously granted the Motion for Appointment of Counsel filed May 10, 1995, by Attorneys James McMillin, Stephen B. Bright and Barry J. Fisher. Also on May 10, 1995, this Court correctly granted said attorneys\u2019 motion for admission pro hac vice and correctly granted Petitioner leave to proceed in forma pauperis in this Court. However, on May 11, 1995, this Court denied Petitioner\u2019s request for a certificate of probable cause based on this Court\u2019s finding that the grounds upon which Petitioner was basing his appeal were frivolous and that said appeal was not taken in \u201cgood faith\u201d within the meaning of <em>Coppedge v. United States, </em>369 U.S. 438[, 82 S.Ct. 917, 8 L.Ed.2d 21] (196[2]). During all of these proceedings, it was this Court\u2019s intention to only allow Petitioner to proceed in forma pauperis without having to pay a filing fee; however, <em>it was never the intention of this Court to appoint attorneys to represent the Petitioner.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b226-12\"><em>Id. </em>at 1-2 (emphasis in Italics added). This appeal from Weeks\u2019s counsel ensued.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b226-13\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b226-14\">Under the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988, \u00a7 7001(b), 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 848(q)(4)(B) (1988), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>Congress established an absolute right to counsel for indigent death-sentenced prisoners seeking federal habeas relief:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-4\">In any post conviction proceeding under section 2254 or 2255 of Title 28, seeking to vacate or set aside a death sentence, any defendant who is or becomes financially unable to obtain adequate representation ... <em>shall be entitled to the appointment of one or more </em>attorneys....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">21 U.S.C. \u00a7 848(q)(4)(B) (emphasis added).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> \u201cOn its faee, this statute grants indigent capital defendants a <em>mandatory </em>right to qualified legal counsel ... \u2018[i]n any [federal] post conviction proceeding.\u2019\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>McFarland v. Scott, </em>512 U.S. 849, -, 114 S.Ct. 2568, 2571, 129 L.Ed.2d 666 (1994) (quoting 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 848(q)(4)(B)) (alteration in original) (emphasis added). Because of the complexity of federal habeas corpus jurisprudence, even for attorneys, and the stringent pleading requirements, the Court recognized that \u201c[a]n attorney\u2019s assistance prior to the filing of a capital defendant\u2019s habeas corpus petition is crucial\u201d to adjudication of an indigent capital petitioner\u2019s claims on the merits. <em>Id. </em>at -, 114 S.Ct. at 2572; <em>see Sloan v. Delo, </em>54 F.3d 1371, 1380 n. 6 (8th Cir.1995) (\u201cThe <em>McFarland </em>Court held that because Congress created a statutory right to counsel for capital defendants during federal habeas proceedings, counsel should be appointed before a petition is actually filed to permit assistance in its preparation.\u201d) (citing 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 848(q)(4)(B)), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 116 S.Ct. 728, 133 L.Ed.2d 679 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b227-12\">Because \u00a7 848(q)(4)(B) mandates counsel for -indigent capital prisoners <em>to prepare </em>federal habeas petitions, a substantive, merits assessment of the petition is irrelevant to the appointment of counsel. 21-U.S.C. \u00a7 848(q)(4)(B); see <em>McFarland, </em>512 U.S. at -, 114 S.Ct. at 2572 (\u201cIn adopting \u00a7 848(q)(4)(B), Congress thus established a right to preapplication legal assistance for capital defendants in federal habeas corpus proceedings.\u201d); <em>In re Joiner, </em>58 F.3d 143, 144 (5th Cir.1995) (per curiam) <em>(\u201cMcFarland ... </em>held that 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 848(q)(4)(B) entitles prisoners seeking federal habeas relief to court-appointed counsel for the preparation of a habeas petition- The Court ... reason[ed] that appointed counsel ... are necessary to prepare and present federal habeas cases effectively.\u201d). Thus, the district court\u2019s determination that Weeks\u2019s habeas petition was frivolous <em>after </em>his execution is inconsequential to the appointment of his counsel <em>to prepare </em>his habeas petition. <em>See In re Joiner, </em>58 F.3d at 144 <em>(\u201cMcFarland </em>addressed the timing of appointment of counsel, not the scope of appointment.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b227-21\">Furthermore, the Supreme Court has explained that indigent litigants\u2019 claims are \u201cfrivolous\u201d when they \u201clack[] an arguable basis either in law or in fact.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>Neitzke v. Williams, </em>490 U.S. 319, 325, 109 S.Ct. 1827, 1831-32, 104 L.Ed.2d 338 (1989). \u201cFactual allegations are frivolous for purpose of [28 U.S.C.] \u00a7 1915(d) when they are \u2018clearly baseless;\u2019 legal theories are frivolous when they are \u2018indisputably meritless.\u2019 \u201d <em>Battle v. Central State Hosp., </em>898 F.2d 126, 129 (11th Cir.1990) (per curiam) (quoting <em>Neitzke, </em>490 U.S. at 327, 109 S.Ct. at 1833). This court also has held that a frivolous analysis under \u00a7 1915(d) involves a determination of \u2018\u201cwhether there is a factual and legal basis, of <em>constitutional dimension, </em>for the asserted wrong.\u2019 \u201d <em>Clark v. Georgia Pardons &amp; Paroles Bd., </em>915 F.2d 636, 639 (11th Cir.1990) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>(quoting <em>Harris v. Menendez, </em>817 F.2d 737, 739 (11th Cir.1987)) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b228-4\">Rather than being baseless, Weeks\u2019s history of mental health evaluation and treatment is documented in the record, and he based his second habeas appeal on his iiicompetency to be executed under <em>Ford v. Wainwright, </em>477 U.S. 399, 106 S.Ct. 2595, 91 L.Ed.2d 335 (1986) (plurality opinion).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> While other circuits have \u201cadopted different legal definitions of Eighth Amendment mental competency for execution\u201d following <em>Ford, </em>the dissent notes that this circuit \u201caddresses this issue for the first time in this case.\u201d <em>Weeks, </em>52 F.3d at 1574, 1575 (Kravitch, J\u201e concurring in part and dissenting in part). In raising the competency-to-be-executed issue, Weeks\u2019s counsel stated an arguable constitutional claim, which had not been decided by this court and which precluded the district court\u2019s reconsidered determination that Weeks\u2019s second habeas petition was frivolous <em>after </em>Weeks\u2019s execution.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> A claim that is arguable, although ultimately unsuccessful, \u201cmust be treated like the claims brought by paying litigants and should survive frivolity review.\u201d <em>Cofield v. Alabama Pub. Serv. Comm\u2019n, </em>936 F.2d 512, 515 (11th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">Significantly, the statute specifically contemplates that a capital inmate shall have federally appointed counsel in habeas proceedings involving competency to be executed. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 848(q)(8).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In a successive death penalty case that raised competency to be executed, the Fifth Circuit reversed the district court\u2019s denial of appointment of counsel under \u00a7 848(q)(4)(B) and explained that \u201c[o]n its, face, \u00a7 848(q)(4)(B) does not condition the appointment of counsel on the sub-stantiality or nonfrivolousness of petitioner\u2019s habeas claims.\u201d <em>Barnard v. Collins, </em>13 F.3d 871, 879 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>510 U.S. 1102, 114 S.Ct. 946, 127 L.Ed.2d 363 (1994). In connection with Weeks\u2019s federal habeas petition, the district court correctly appointed Weeks\u2019s counsel, who had represented him in his state postconviction proceedings as well as prepared his habeas petition without compensation. The district court erred in revisiting its former ruling based on its assessment of the merits of Weeks\u2019s habeas petition after his execution.</p>\n<p id=\"Aed\">The district court also erroneously based its <em>sua sponte </em>order that denied Weeks\u2019s counsel\u2019s appointment on Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(a), which permits corrections \u201cat any time\u201d of \u201c[cjlerical mistakes\u201d in judgments and orders \u201carising from oversight or omission.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(a). While the district court may correct clerical errors to reflect what was intended at the time -of ruling, \u201c[ejrrors that affect substantial rights- of the parties ... are beyond the scope of rule 60(a).\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>Mullins v. Nickel </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number><em>Plate Mining Co., </em>691 F.2d 971, 973 (11th Cir.1982) (citing <em>Warner v. City of Bay St. Louis, </em>526 F.2d 1211, 1212 (5th Cir.1976)); <em>see United States v. Whittington, </em>918 F.2d 149, 150 n. 1 (11th Cir.1990) (noting that \u201cfor Rule 60(a) purposes, a mistake of law is not a \u2018clerical mistake,\u2019 \u2018oversight,\u2019 or \u2018omission\u2019\u201d (quoting <em>Warner, </em>526 F.2d at 1212)); <em>see also Truskoski v. ESPN, Inc., </em>60 F.3d 74, 77 (2d Cir.1995) (per curiam) (\u201cThat provision, which states in pertinent part that \u2018[clerical mistakes in judgments ... may be corrected by the court at any time,\u2019 permits only a correction for the purpose of reflecting accurately a decision that the court actually made.\u201d (quoting Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(a)). \u201cAlthough Rule 60(a) clerical mistakes need not be made by the clerk, they must be in the nature of recitation of amanuensis mistakes that a clerk might make. <em>They are not errors of substantive judgment.\u201d Janes v. Anderson-Tully Co., </em>722 F.2d 211, 212 (5th Cir.1984) (per curiam) (emphasis added); <em>see Paddington Partners v. Bouchard, </em>34 F.3d 1132, 1140 (2d Cir.1994) (\u201cAn error in a judgment that accurately reflects the decision of the court or jury as rendered is not \u2018clerical\u2019 within the terms of Rule 60(a).\u201d (quoting Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(a)). \u201cA district court is not permitted, however, to clarify a judgment pursuant to Rule 60(a) to reflect a new and subsequent intent because it perceives its original judgment to be incorrect.\u201d <em>Burton v.

Therefore, the district court not only erred legally in its subsequent <em>sua sponte </em>denial of Weeks\u2019s counsel\u2019s appointment motion, but also it erred procedurally in using Rule 60(a) as authority for its changed ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">Weeks\u2019s postconvietion counsel appeal the district court\u2019s subsequent, <em>sua sponte </em>denial of their motion for appointment of counsel when they sought payment for their federal habeas representation of Weeks, after the court previously had granted this motion. Because the district court erred legally and procedurally in denying Weeks\u2019s counsel\u2019s appointment motion, we REVERSE. We direct the district court to reinstate its former order granting Weeks\u2019s counsel\u2019s appointment motion and to proceed with compensating them appropriately for their federal ha-beas representation of Weeks.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b225-15\">.
