Specifically, Alexander contends that the district court erred in concluding it lacked the authority to allow his federal sentence to run concurrently because of the requirements of Application Note 6 under United States Sentencing Guideline \u00a7 5G1.3(c) (1995). Because we agree with the district court that Application Note 6 mandates a consecutive sentence in this case, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-8\">Pursuant to a plea agreement, Alexander pled guilty to conspiracy to conduct illegal straw purchases of firearms, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371, and was sentenced to .twenty-four months\u2019 imprisonment, three years\u2019 supervised release, and $50 special assessment. At the time Alexander committed the charged offense, he was on state probation for attempted murder. His probation was revoked on September 19, 1994, an adjudication of guilt was entered, and he was sentenced to twenty years\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-9\">The pre-sentence report in the charged offense recommended, pursuant to Application Note 6 of \u00a7 5G1.3, that the sentence for the instant offence run consecutively to Alexander\u2019s undischarged state sentence. At sentencing, Alexander argued that the language in Note 6 (Note 4 under the previous guidelines) is instructive rather than mandatory and that the district court retained discretion under \u00a7 5G1.3(c) to impose a \u201creasonable incremental punishment\u201d for the instant offense rather than a consecutive sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-10\">The district court ordered Alexander\u2019s sentence to run consecutively to his undischarged state sentence. The court determined that the language \u201cshould be imposed to run consecutively,\u201d found in Application Note 6 under \u00a7 5G1.3, mandated consecutive sentences. The court specifically noted, however, that if Note 6 was not mandatory, the court would \u201crecalculate on the basis of an incremental sentence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b125-12\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-13\">We review de novo the district court\u2019s application of \u00a7 5G1.3. <em>United States v. Bryant, </em>991 F.2d 171, 177 (5th Cir.1993). In general, a sentence will be upheld on review unless it was \u201cimposed in violation of law; imposed as a result of an incorrect application of the sentencing guidelines; or outside the range of the applicable sentencing guideline and is unreasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Garcia, </em>962 F.2d 479, 480-81 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>506 U.S. 902, 113 S.Ct. 293, 121 L.Ed.2d 217 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b125-14\">Section 5G1.3 governs imposition of sentences on defendants who are convicted of a crime while subject to an undischarged term of imprisonment for a previous conviction. Under subsection (a), the new sentence must be consecutive if a defendant is convicted for a crime committed while \u201cserving a term of imprisonment (including work release, furlough, or escape status), or after sentencing for, but before commencing service of, such term of imprisonment.\u201d Subsection (b) provides for a concurrent .sentence where the undischarged term resulted from offenses \u201cthat have been fully taken into account\u201d in determining the offense level for the present offense. Finally, subsection (e) provides that \u201cin any other ease, the sentence for the instant offense may be imposed to run concurrently, partially concurrently, or consecutively to the prior undischarged term of imprisonment to achieve a reasonable punishment for the instant offense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b125-15\">Application Note 6 addresses revocations of probation, parole, or supervised release. It states in relevant part: \u25a0</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-16\">If the defendant was on federal or state probation, parole, or supervised release at the time of the instant offense, and has had such probation, parole, or supervised release revoked, the sentence for the instant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>offense should be imposed to run consecutively to the term imposed for the violation of probation, parole, or supervised release.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AD\">The Note also references U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.3, which sets forth a policy that any imprisonment imposed for violating probation or supervised release should be consecutive to any sentence of imprisonment being served or subsequently imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-4\">It is undisputed that \u00a7 5G1.3(c) governs this ease. It is also undisputed that the facts of Alexander\u2019s case squarely fit into the scenario envisioned by Application Note 6. At issue is only whether Note 6 imposes a mandatory duty' on the trial judge to impose a consecutive sentence, or whether the trial judge retains discretion to impose a concurrent or partially concurrent sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">We begin by noting that both \u00a7 5G1.3(c) and Application Note 6 are binding on the courts. This is true even though \u00a7 5G1.3(c) is designated a \u201cPolicy Statement\u201d rather than a \u201cGuideline.\u201d To the extent that they interpret substantive guidelines and do not conflict with them or with any statutory directives, policy statements contained in the Sentencing Guidelines are authoritative. <em>Williams v. United States, </em>503 U.S. 193, 199, 112 S.Ct. 1112, 1118-19, 117 L.Ed.2d 341 (1992); <em>cf. United States v. Headrick, </em>963 F.2d 777 (5th Cir.1992) (policy statements in Chapter 7 of the Sentencing Guidelines must be considered, but are advisory only because they do not interpret or explain any statute or guideline). We stated in <em>United States v. Hernandez </em>that \u201c[w]e believe that \u00a7 5G1.3(c), a policy statement, is binding on district courts because it completes and informs the application of a particular guideline.\u201d 64 F.3d 179, 182 (5th Cir.1995); <em>see also United States v. Brewer, </em>23 F.3d 1317, 1322 (8th Cir.1994) (\u201cThis policy statement interprets \u00a7 5G1.3, whose purpose is to impose \u2018an appropriate incremental punishment for the instant offense that most clearly approximates the sentence that would have been imposed had all the sentences been imposed at the same time.\u2019 \u201d) (quoting U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.3 comment, (baekg\u2019d)). We also specifically held that \u201cthe district court must consider the policy statement to this particular guideline when applicable. Otherwise, the sentence may result in an incorrect application of the guidelines.\u201d <em>Hernandez, </em>64 F.3d at 182; <em>see also Williams, </em>503 U.S. at 200-01, 112 S.Ct. at 1119; <em>United States v. Sorensen, </em>58 F.3d 1154, 1158 (7th Cir.1995) (failure to apply \u00a7 5G1.3(c) is the same as not applying any other guideline and is thus ap-pealable).</p>\n<p id=\"b126-8\">Similarly, where the commentary to a guideline section functions to interpret that section or to explain how it is to be applied, a sentencing court is bound to consider its implications, unless it is plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the guidelines. <em>Stinson v. United States, </em>508 U.S. 36, 41-48, 113 S.Ct. 1913, 1917-20, 123 L.Ed.2d 598 (1993); <em>Hernandez, </em>64 F.3d at 183. Because Application Note 6 to \u00a7 5G1.3 interprets this policy statement and explains how it should be applied, a sentencing court is bound to consider its implications. <em>Hernandez, </em>64 F.3d at 183; <em>United States v. Coleman, </em>15 F.3d 610, 612 (6th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b126-9\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-10\">Alexander advances two main arguments for why Note 6 should not be read as mandating a consecutive sentence. First, Alexander argues, the plain meaning of the term \u201cshould,\u201d as opposed to \u201cshall,\u201d connotes something less than an absolute mandate. Second, he contends that reading Note 6 as a mandatory requirement would conflict with our recent decision in <em>United States v. Hernandez. </em>Both of these arguments are unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-11\">Three circuits have addressed this precise issue. All three have concluded that despite the Sentencing Commission\u2019s use of the word \u201cshould\u201d rather than \u201cshall,\u201d the \u201cgreater weight of the evidence suggests\u201d Application Note 6 imposes a mandatory obligation on the district court. <em>United States v. Gondek, </em>65 F.3d 1, 2-3 (1st Cir.1995); <em>see also United States v. McCarthy, </em>77 F.3d 522, 539-40 (1st Cir.1996); <em>United States v. Bernard, </em>48 F.3d 427, 430-32 (9th Cir.1995); <em>United States v. Dungy, </em>1996 WL 193150, at *2 (8th Cir. April 23, 1996) (unpublished disposition). Other courts, including this Court, while not directly deciding this issue have intimated that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>Application Note 6 is mandatory. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Torrez, </em>40 F.3d 84, 88 n. 2 (5th Cir.1994) (accepting that the Note \u201cmandates a consecutive sentence\u201d but declining to apply because sentencing preceded Note\u2019s effective date); <em>United States v. Brewer, </em>1996 WL 7961, at *3 (4th Cir. Jan. 8, 1996) (unpublished disposition) (stating Note \u201cinstructs the district court to impose a sentence consecutive to a probation revocation sentence\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 116 S.Ct. 1699, 134 L.Ed.2d 798 (1996). <em>But cf. United States v. Smith, </em>80 F.3d 1188, 1192 (7th Cir.1996) (describing the Note as setting forth \u201ca strong preference for consecutive sentences\u201d). Moreover, at least two other courts reached the same result prior to promulgation of the Note based in part on the policy statement contained in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.3(f), which is specifically cross-referenced in Note 6. <em>See United States v. Glasener, </em>981 F.2d 973, 975 (8th Cir.1992); <em>United States v. Flowers, </em>13 F.3d 395, 397 (11th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">We agree with the analysis of our sister circuits that Application Note 6 is mandatory notwithstanding its use of the term \u201cshould.\u201d The Note plainly states that if the defendant committed the offense while on probation and his probation has been revoked, the sentence should be imposed consecutively. No qualifications or reservations are suggested. As the First Circuit observed, the Note \u201crepresents the Commission\u2019s determination as to what is a \u2018reasonable incremental punishment\u2019 in the narrow situation described in the Note.\u201d <em>Gondek, </em>65 F.3d at 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-7\">Moreover, as these courts have noted, the situations covered by Note 6 are analytically similar to those governed by \u00a7 5G1.3(a), which mandates consecutive sentences. Subsection (a) imposes a consecutive sentence where a defendant is convicted for a crime committed while \u201cserving a term of imprisonment (including work release, furlough, or escape status), or after sentencing for, but before commencing service of, such term of imprisonment.\u201d Likewise, Application Note 6 requires a consecutive sentence where a defendant on probation, parole, or work release at the time he commits the offense has that probation, parole, or work release revoked prior to sentencing. This latter scenario is virtually identical to that described in subsection (a) of a defendant convicted of a crime \u201cafter sentencing for, but before commencing service of,\u201d a term of imprisonment. That the Commission chose to mandate such a result through an Application Note rather than amending the Guidelines directly is irrelevant. <em>See Gondek, </em>65 F.3d at 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-9\">Nor does such a reading of Note 6 conflict with the general grant of discretion in \u00a7 5G1.3(c). Subsection (c) was intended as a catch-all and generally grants broad discretion to the district court in those situations not governed by the mandates of subsections (a) and (b). However, nothing in subsection (c) forecloses the Commission\u2019s ability to create other exceptions to the district court\u2019s discretion, and there is nothing inconsistent in doing so through an Application Note rather than a Guideline.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-10\">Finally, Alexander argues that interpreting Application Note 6 as mandatory conflicts with our recent decision in <em>Hernandez. </em>This argument grossly overstates our holding in that ease. In <em>Hernandez, </em>we addressed whether Application Note 3 to \u00a7 5G1.3 under the 1994 Guidelines removed the district court\u2019s authority to deviate from the suggest-\u00e9d methodology for determining an appropriate incremental punishment.' Note 3 provided in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-11\">To the extent practicable, the court should consider a reasonable incremental penalty to be a sentence for the instant offense that results in a combined sentence of imprisonment that approximates the total punishment that would have been imposed ... had all of the offenses been federal offenses for which sentences were being imposed at the same time.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b127-12\">We held that \u201cdue to the permissive language of the commentary, ... the suggested methodology is advisory only.\u201d <em>Hernandez, </em>64 F.3d at 183.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-13\">There, however, the commentary specifically indicated that the methodology was meant only to \u201cassist the court in determining the appropriate sentence,\u201d and that, even then, it need only be followed \u201cto the extent practicable.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.3, comment, (n. 3). No such limiting language is present in Application Note 6 and nothing in <em>Hernandez </em>forecloses the decision we reach today.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>For the foregoing reasons, the decision of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
