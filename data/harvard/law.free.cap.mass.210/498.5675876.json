It appeared that the plaintiff relied upon that part of R. L. c. 58, \u00a7 12, which reads, \u201cNo charge for the use of a meter during any portion of twelve consecutive months shall be made if the consumer during said time uses gas to the value of seven dollars; \u201d that the items of the declaration represented the amounts by which the value of gas used at each meter each <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>year fell short of $7; and that the meters were the property of the plaintiff and were of an automatic variety, whose operation was described in the.bill of exceptions as follows: \u201cconsumers wishing gas could- deposit a twenty-five cent piece into them through a slot. Gas then would flow through the meters until a certain amount had passed, when the meters would automatically stop the flow until another coin was inserted.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b523-3\">During the direct examination of a witness for the plaintiff, counsel for the defendant stated to the presiding judge : \u201c We admit that meter rent is collected and we admit under the law it may be demanded.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b523-4\">Other facts are stated in the opinion.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b523-5\">At the close of the evidence the defendant asked the presiding judge to rule and instruct the jury that, \u201c if the plaintiff failed during each of the years in question to keep throughout the year a supply of gas to flow through the meters of the defendant\u2019s house and the defendant did not use gas to the value of seven dollars through any meter during each of those- years, the plaintiff could not legally make a charge against the defendant for the use pf a meter during either of those years.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b523-6\">The ruling was refused. The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff on two items of the declaration in the sum of $5; and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b523-7\">The case was submitted on briefs.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b523-8\">R.

As a natural inference from these findings they might further find that the defendant assented to the terms of the notice and that the meters were used by him in compliance therewith ; that these terms entered into the contract between him and the plaintiff; and that in accordance with the contract as thus established there were due to the plaintiff the sums named in the third and fourth items. This would make out a case for these items which were the only ones on which the jury held the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-4\">There is nothing in R L. c. 58, \u00a7 12, upon which the defendant relies, inconsistent with the making of such a contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
