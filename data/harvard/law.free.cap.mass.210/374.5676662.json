The judge made a memorandum of decision, which included the following findings:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b399-6\">\u201c The plaintiff was appointed a constable in Fitchburg on January 6, 1908, for one year, or until his successor was (or should be) appointed and qualified. On January 4, 1909, he was reappointed for a like period or term. He duly qualified and served for each term. July 7, 1908, a warrant was issued to him by the mayor of that city, directing him forthwith to kill, or cause to be killed, all dogs within said city, not duly licensed and collared according to law, and to make due return of the warrant and his doings thereunder on or before October first of that year. He made return thereof and was paid for his services rendered, to October 1, 1908. . . .

L. c. 102, \u00a7 143. He acted under said warrant from the date thereof to and until October 1, 1909, and then made return thereof to the mayor. Said return was not in full compliance with the requirements of law, St. 1907, c. 240, \u00a7 2, amending R. L. c. 102, \u00a7 144, in that it did not state the names of the owners or keepers of the dogs killed by the plaintiff under said warrant, or any of them ; and it did not state the names of the persons against whom complaints had been made, or whether complaints had been made or entered against all persons who had failed to comply with the provisions of law relative to the licensing of dogs, and the plaintiff did not thereafter and at the expiration of his term of office make any further or other return to the mayor issuing said warrant of July 9, 1909.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b400-5\">\u201c And, if it is material, the court finds that the plaintiff did not render services as dog constable, or dog officer, or under or by virtue of the provisions of R. L. c. 102, \u00a7 143, as amended by St. 1907, c. 240, and St. 1908, c. 182, for three hundred and sixty-one days in the year 1909 as set forth in the declaration in this section [count].</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b400-6\">\u201c The court finds that the term or time of his actual employment in the rendering of such services during said year was eighty-four days and no more, and that he is entitled to receive compensation therefor at the rate of $2.75 per day.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b400-7\">\u201cThe plaintiff held office for the entire year 1909, but the term of his employment within the meaning of the statute was eighty-four days only.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b400-8\">\u201c The city of Fitchburg had at the time twenty-five thousand inhabitants or over and the regular police officers of that city during said year 1909 received as wages $2.75 per day.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b400-9\">\"The plaintiff is entitled to recover for services rendered during the year1909 the sum of $231 under the third count of his amended declaration, and judgment is to be entered accordingly.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b400-10\">At the close of the evidence the judge refused to make certain rulings requested by the plaintiff relating to matters which are covered by the memorandum of decision.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b400-11\">The plaintiff also asked the judge to make the following findings of fact:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b401-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>\u201c 1.

Ho exception lies to the refusal of the judge to make particular findings of fact. Were this not so, the judge was not bound, even upon the plaintiff\u2019s testimony and the evidence furnished by the entries in his books, to make the findings asked for, and the findings made were fully warranted by the testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-11\">2. It was required by R. L. c. 102, \u00a7 143, that the plaintiff\u2019s bill should be approved by the mayor of his city and should be paid from a certain fund. This approval was a condition precedent to payment. Without it the county treasurer had no authority to pay the bill It was the only means provided to inform the treasurer that the services had been performed and that the bill was a proper one. In this respect the case is stronger than was presented in <em>Haverhill </em>v. <em>Marlborough, </em>187 Mass. 150, 156. And it is too plain for argument that an approval by one who was not mayor, although he had held that office in a former year when it was claimed that the services had been rendered, was not the approval required by the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-12\">3. Under the same statute, as amended by St. 1907, c. 240, and St. 1908, c. 182, it was provided that the plaintiff\u2019s term of office should be for one year or until the appointment and qualification of his successor, and that his pay should be \u201c the same wages per diem during the term of [his] employment \u201d as were paid to the police officers of the city. The change in the same statute from \u201c office \u201d to \u201c employment \u201d must be deemed to have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>been made advisedly. His wages were to be by the day during the term, not of his office, but of his employment. There is a manifest reason- for this in the nature of the' services which he was to render. When, as in this case, he actually served only eighty-four days in the year, we cannot suppose that it was intended to pay him for every day, including Sundays and holidays. If this were so, there would be no occasion for requiring a bill for services and its approval by the mayor, or for making the pay a <em>per diem </em>one. Indeed our view seems to have been that, of the plaintiff, for he based his demand on the claim, which however he failed to maintain on the evidence, that he actually had worked on every day except while he was absent by the permission of the mayor.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-3\">We are clearly of opinion that he was entitled to recover only for the time during which he was actually employed in rendering services. St. 1911, c. 391, passed after the bringing of this action, and in terms limiting the compensation of dog officers to the time of their actual employment, seems to us to be rather a declaratory act than an indication that previously the effect of the statute was different.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-4\">The plaintiff\u2019s requests for rulings were rightly dealt with.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
