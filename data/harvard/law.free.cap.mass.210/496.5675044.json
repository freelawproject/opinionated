Averill. Writ dated March 24,1908.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b521-5\">In the Superior Court the case was tried before Raymond, J. There was evidence on the plaintiff\u2019s behalf tending to show the agreement relied on, and that, although the defendant made a like agreement with Donaldson, the agreements were several and not joint. The defendant contended and introduced evidence tending to show that there was a joint agreement, that an action against the defendant by Donaldson had been settled by a judgment entered by agreement, and therefore that the claim of the plaintiff against the defendant had been discharged.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b521-6\">At the close of the evidence the defendant asked for rulings, (1) that the action could not be maintained upon the evidence ; (2) that the evidence tended to show only a liability to the plaintiff jointly with Donaldson, and that the defendant was not liable to the plaintiff alone; (3) that the defendant was only liable to the sureties in one sum of $2,000, the amount of Averill\u2019s bail bond; and (4) that, if the defendant was liable to the plaintiff and Donaldson, whether jointly or severally, upon the bail bond, then the judgment. and satisfaction by the defendant recovered by Donaldson was a bar to further recovery.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b521-9\">The ruEngs were refused. The jury found for the plaintiff in the sum of $641.41; and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b521-10\"><em>D. L. </em>Smith, for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b521-11\"><em>S. Parsons </em>&amp; G. <em>C. </em>Donaldson, for the plaintiff, were not called upon.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b521-12\">Hammond, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AAe\">Whether the promise was made by the defendant and whether it was a joint or several promise were upon the evidence clearly questions of fact for the jury. If the liability was several, each promisee must sue alone; and a recovery by one on the promise made to him would be no bar to an action by the other on the promise made to this other. All the requests were therefore rightly refused. The exception to the admission of the record is not argued, and in view of its untenable nature we consider it waived.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-13\">The exceptions are frivolous and are overruled with double costs, and interest at the rate of twelve per cent a year upon the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>amount of damage as found by the jury from the time the exceptions were allowed; and it is</p>\n<p id=\"b522-3\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
