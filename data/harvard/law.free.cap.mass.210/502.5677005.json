There was evidence tending to show that Saltman had been an overall manufacturer in Cambridge for seventeen years, that his wife was the defendant\u2019s first cousin, that he once had worked for the defendant and in all had known him for about twenty-two years, during which time he had bought goods of him on credit on which he made payments on account; that at various times he had owed the defendant considerable money, on March 19, 1907, owing him $2,542; that he had paid other persons interest as high as eighteen per cent per year; that at the time of the trial he was in business with a relation of the defendant; and that he had filed a voluntary petition in bankruptcy on July 17, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>1908, in wMch he made affidavit that his liabilities amounted to $7,002.83 and his assets to $315.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b528-5\">Saltman, who was called as a witness by the plaintiff, testified with reluctance that he had been unable to pay his debts on January 17 and March 17, 1908; that during the six months preceding July 17, 1908, he had had no conversation with the defendant in regard to his financial condition; that on March 14, 1908, he had a conversation with the defendant in his office <em>l </em>that the defendant\u2019s bookkeeper used to put sales to and payments by him in a \u201c little book \u201d of Saltman\u2019s; that on March 14, 1908, he owed $1,962 to the defendant, who figured up that amount; that on that day the defendant made out twenty-six notes, covering the whole balance then due, payable from one to twenty-six months consecutively, for $75 each plus interest at twelve per cent, except that the last note was for $109, being $87 plus interest, andsaid to Saltman that he just wanted to straighten out the account, \u201cjumped on Saltman;\u201d that Saltman asked him why the defendant was now starting in with notes, and the defendant said, \u201cWe want once for all to straighten out how much you owe him, and what goods you buy hereafter will be a different transaction; \u201d that Saltman then signed the notes; that the giving of these notes was not in the usual course of business between him and the defendant; that it was the first time that the account between him and the defendant was put in the shape of notes; that before that the defendant used to charge the goods on bills and \u201c it used to run right along; \u201d that he had no agreement to give these notes before he went at that time to the defendant\u2019s place, and when going there he didn\u2019t know he was going to sign any notes; that the defendant said that he didn\u2019t want to let the account run the way it was; that the notes were made payable so that it would be easy for Saltman to pay; that defendant said it was \u201c too much for him to keep track of the account in that little book; \u201d that after March 14,1908, at divers times, up to the assignment, he bought goods of the defendant, paying therefor with checks dated ahead ten days, the defendant sending him the goods and he sending the defendant the check so dated ahead, all of which checks were paid except the last one or two; that he had been in the defendant\u2019s place between March 14 and July 17, 1908, sometimes two or three times a. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>week and had talked with the defendant perhaps forty times, but that during all these conversations he could not remember whether or not he talked about his financial condition; that between March 17 and July 17,1908, he had paid the defendant |1,538.89 in checks, including three checks with which he paid three of the notes given on March 14; that his bank balances on June 1 and July 1, 1908, respectively, were $143.60 and $18.16.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b529-5\">At the close of the evidence, the defendant asked the presiding judge to rule \u201c that the evidence was insufficient to justify a verdict for the plaintiff.\u201d The ruling was refused.

They could find that Saltman was insolvent on and before March 14, 1908, and remained so until he went into bankruptcy four months and three days later. From the very character of the transaction between the defendant and Saltman, the giving of the notes bearing the rate of interest and coming due at the dates fixed, and the arrangement that Saltman should still buy goods of the defendant and pay for them either in cash or by checks to be dated some days ahead and then to be collected in regular course, in connection with what could be found to be the desperate condition of Salt-man\u2019s finances, the jury could infer not only'that Saltman intended to prefer and did prefer the defendant, but that the defendant had reasonable cause to believe and actually did believe that Saltman intended thereby to give him a preference. Three of these notes were paid as they respectively came due. Certainly the jury could find that these payments constituted preferences, that Saltman so intended, and that the defendant had reasonable cause to believe this. That entitled the plaintiff to go to the jury. <em>Purinton </em>v. <em>Chamberlin, </em>131 Mass. 589, 590. <em>Killam </em>v. <em>Peirce, </em>153 Mass. 502. <em>Chipman </em>v. <em>McClellan, </em>159 Mass. 363. <em>Jaquith </em>v. <em>Winnisimmet National Bank, </em>182 Mass. 53. <em>Atherton </em>v. <em>Emerson, </em>199 Mass. 199, 211. <em>Ridge Avenue Bank </em>v. <em>Studheim, </em>145 Fed. Rep. 798.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-9\">The defendant\u2019s counsel has ingeniously argued that the pay<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>ments made by Saltman for goods bought by him after the -transaction of March could not be recovered as preferences, because they were really cash payments and so understood by the parties. But this point is not open to <em>him; </em>for his only exception was to the refusal of the judge to rule that the evidence was insiifficient to justify a verdict for the plaintiff, that is, a verdict for any amount. Moreover, the jury could find that these payments were made, not when the goods were bought and the checks dated ahead were given, but only when the days of their dates were respectively reached and they were paid. In that event, the purchases were not made for cash, and the payments were really payments of a precedent debt. <em>In re </em>Lyon, 121 Fed.
