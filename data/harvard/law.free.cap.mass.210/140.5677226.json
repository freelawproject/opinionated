At the trial of the actian her counsel in his opening address to the jury stated among other facts that the premises were let to her husband. A verdict was ordered for the defendant on the offer of proof contained in the opening statement, and the plaintiff alleged exceptions, at the argument of which in this court no question was raised by the defendant as to the apparent variance between the declaration and the offer of proof; and, because recovery by the plaintiff would not have been affected, whether she or her husband was the defendant\u2019s tenant, this court gave no significance to the variance except to call attention to its existence, but considered only whether, if the other facts, which the plaintiff had offered to show, had been proved the case should have been submitted to the jury.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b164-24\">At the trial of an action by a married woman against the owner of a three tenement house to recover for injuries alleged to have been caused by a defective condition of a step, the plaintiff\u2019s counsel in his opening statement to the jury offered to prove that the plaintiff\u2019s husband had inspected the house when it was not entirely completed and had selected one of the tenements, that he and the defendant had agreed upon a rent and that he should take possession when the defendant should notify him that the house was ready; that later, upon the defendant\u2019s notifying him that he could move in at any time, the plaintiff's husband brought a load of goods to the house, that it appeared that cement steps which were to be put in at the back of the house for common use of the occupants of all of the tenements were not yet constructed and that there were no steps there; that, the defendant\u2019s attention being called to the need of a step, he produced a box and placed it where the steps should be, stating <em>\u201c </em>That will do for a while.

I am going to get cement steps in in a few days \u2019; that the plaintiff and her husband and other tenants then moved into the building; that the box remained there something like a month and five or six days; that it wobbled and shook with the cinders under it and became worse as time went on; that it was not intended to be the permanent means of approach to that door; that the plaintiff\u2019s husband and other tenants called the defendant\u2019s attention to this insufficiency on two different occasions before the time of the plaintiff\u2019s injury, and that on each occasion he gave some excuse for not doing it at that particular time, but said that he would do it in four or five days; that the back door and this box were used in common by the three tenants in the building in reaching the back yard where the clothes lines were; that upon the nineteenth day of May, the plaintiff, living on the second floor, put her washing out in the back yard, [that later] she noticed something drop from the line and on to the ground and went down the back stair and out in the back hall, which was used in common by all the tenants, for the purpose of going out of the back door to pick up the article which had fallen from the clothes line, and stepped from the back door to the box which, as soon as she stepped on it, turned over and threw her violently to the ground causing her severe injuries.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b166-5\">The plaintiff also offered to prove that \u201c she did not think that the box was as safe as steps would have been, but relied upon the assurance of the defendant that steps would be constructed in a few days, and that until that time, she thought she could get along with the box by using special care and did use <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>special care in stepping on to it on each occasion and on the occasion of the injury.\u201d The presiding judge ruled that the evidence set out in this paragraph would not be admissible.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b167-5\">The presiding judge ruled that, upon the pleadings and the offer of proof, no action could be maintained.

Upon her offer of proof it was her husband and not herself who hired the tenement and became a tenant of the defendant. But this circumstance would not have prevented her from recovering upon a proper declaration if her husband could have recovered for a like injury to himself. <em>Wilcox </em>v. <em>Zane, </em>167 Mass. 302. <em>Domenicis </em>v. <em>Fleisher, </em>195 Mass. 281. We therefore consider the question upon its merits, as it has been argued by both parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-9\">The jury could find that the steps which the defendant was to put up and the box which he supplied for temporary use were, and were to remain, in his possession and control, and were intended for the common use of all the tenants in the house. If so, it was his duty, while the box remained in use as he had put it, to use reasonable care to keep it and the foundation of ashes and cinders upon which it rested in as safe a condition for its intended use as it was or appeared to be in when he put it there. <em>Looney </em>v. <em>McLean, </em>129 Mass. 33. <em>Andrews </em>v. <em>Williamson, </em>193 Mass. 92. But, as the plaintiff offered to show, it remained there for more than a month; it wobbled and shook upon the cinders under it and became worse 'as time went on. The defendant\u2019s attention was called to its insufficiency, and he gave excuses for doing nothing at that time, but said \u201c that he would do it in four or five days.\u201d He still did nothing, although thus notified of the state of affairs; and finally, when the plaintiff was using the box as the defendant intended it to be used, it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>turned over and threw her down, causing the injuries complained of. This would warrant a finding that the accident was due to a negligent failure on the defendant\u2019s part to keep the temporary step in as safe a condition as when he put it there, and so would entitle the plaintiff to recover if she was in the exercise of due care. The case, would come within the rules laid down by our decisions. See for example <em>Lydecker </em>v. Brintnall, 158 Mass. 292, 297; <em>Robbins </em>v. Atkins, 168 Mass. 45; <em>Harrinson </em>v. Jelly, 175 Mass. 292; <em>Lindsey </em>v. Leighton, 150 Mass. 285; <em>Cummings </em>v. Ayer, 188 Mass. 292.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">That the defendant\u2019s duty to put up permanent cement steps rested merely upon his contract does not justify him in a negligent failure to keep the temporary substitute which he had provided from deteriorating and growing more unsafe than it was in the beginning. It was not a part of the construction or permanent arrangement of the premises, as in <em>Quinn </em>v. Perham, 151 Mass. 162, 163, <em>Moynihan </em>v. <em>Allyn, </em>162 Mass. 270, <em>Phelan </em>v. <em>Fitz</em>patrick, 188 Mass. 237, and other similar cases. The very fact that he allowed this merely temporary arrangement, intended to last only for a few days, to remain in use unattended to for more than a month, though aware of its growing insufficiency, might be found to show negligence. The liability which was enforced against a landlord in <em>Miles </em>v. Janvrin, 196 Mass. 431, and 200 Mass. 514, rested upon a contract. But the relation which in that case grew out of the contract between the parties, and by which the defendant was subjected to the burden of looking out for the safe condition of the leased premises, existed between these parties from the beginning, as to the steps and the substitute for them, by reason of the fact that they remained in the defendant\u2019s possession and control.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">The jury could have found that the plaintiff was in the exercise of due care. <em>Faxon </em>v. Butler, 206 Mass. 500. <em>Frost </em>v. McCarthy, 200 Mass. 445. <em>Watkins </em>v. <em>Goodall, </em>138 Mass. 533. <em>Dewire </em>v. Bailey, 131 Mass. 169. <em>Looney </em>v. McLean, 129 Mass. 33.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-7\">It was competent for the plaintiff to testify that she was using special care at the time she was injured, and that though she did not think the box as safe as the steps would have been, she relied upon the assurance of the defendant that steps would be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>constructed in a few days, and thought until that time that she could get along with the box by using special care. This comes within the principle of <em>Malcolm </em>v. <em>Fuller, </em>152 Mass. 160, and <em>Carriere </em>v. <em>Merrick Lumber Co. </em>203 Mass. 322, 327.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">\n<em>New trial ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
