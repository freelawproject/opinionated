[at a certain price] . . . We agree to advise you two months in advance of our requirements.\u201d The customer never notified the manufacturer two months in advance of his requirements, but with the customer\u2019s knowledge the manufacturer made frequent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>visits to the customer\u2019s place of business for the purpose of keeping in touch with his needs, and manufactured and kept on hand a reserve supply of bottles for the purpose of filling the customer\u2019s orders as they were given. At the end of the period of the contract the manufacturer had on hand a large supply of bottles as to which the customer had given no notice that he would require them and no orders, and sought to compel the customer to pay therefor. <em>Held, </em>that, the manufacturer having made the surplus without an order or notice from the customer, the customer was not liable therefor under the terms of the contract.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b619-3\">Contract for an alleged breach of the contract set ont in the opinion, the plaintiff alleging in substance that the Cumberland Glass Manufacturing Company, his assignor, pursuant to . the terms of the contract, beside 60,000 gross of bottles which were delivered to and accepted by the defendant, had manufactured 9,729 gross, which it offered to deliver to the defendant but which the defendant refused to receive. The plaintiff claimed the contract price of the manufactured bottles. Writ dated June 10, 1905.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b619-4\">The case was referred to Carleton Hunneman, Esquire, as auditor, who filed a report containing findings for the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b619-5\">In the Superior Court the case was tried before <em>Morton, </em>J. There was evidence that the vice-president of the Cumberland Glass Manufacturing Company made frequent trips to the defendant\u2019s place of business for the purpose of keeping in touch with the defendant\u2019s needs as to bottles. There was controverted evidence on the question, whether the 9,729 gross .of bottles, the contract price of which the plaintiff was seeking to recover, ever were ordered from the plaintiff\u2019s assignor by the defendant, and the jury were instructed: \u201cThe plaintiff can hold the defendant responsible for an excess supply which it has on hand only when such excess was manufactured as a result of some act or word of the defendant, so definite as reasonably to constitute an order and warrant the manufacture. That is the sole question in this case for the jury.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b619-6\">With regard to the plaintiff\u2019s assignor manufacturing a reserve supply of the bottles without orders from the defendant, but in anticipation of orders, the judge also instructed the jury as follows: \u201c If the plaintiff chose to manufacture and keep on hand a reserve supply of bottles so as to be ready to fill orders, it could not hold the defendant responsible for that surplus except so far <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>as the surplus was manufactured in reliance upon some act or written or spoken word of the defendant, and some act or word so definite that the plaintiff could fairly and reasonably rely upon it as an order. The plaintiff had the right to avail itself of the two months\u2019 provision in the contract, it had the right to say to the defendant, \u2018You must give us two months\u2019 written notice of what your requirements are.\u2019 That was put in for the benefit of the plaintiff, and if they had availed themselves of it and had obtained from the defendant a written notice two months in advance of what their requirements would be and had manufactured under that written notice, the number which the requirements indicated, the plaintiff could hold the defendant responsible for that number whether they were actually needed or not. It could, in other words, have secured a definite and conclusive statement of the requirements.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b620-5\">The following rulings, asked for by the plaintiff, were refused by the judge:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b620-6\">\u201c 1. The agreement between the parties was a supply contract under the terms of which the plaintiffs had a right to \u00abmanufacture as many bottles as a reasonably prudent manufacturer would have manufactured for the use of the defendant at the rate they were using them and had the further right to compel the defendant to take them when manufactured or pay damages therefor in case of refusal.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b620-7\">\u201c 2. Under a supply contract such as involved in this case, the supplyee cannot suddenly discontinue ordering without taking such goods as the manufacturer, in the ordinary course of business, has in the exercise of reasonable judgment manufactured without being liable in damages.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b620-8\">\u201c 6.

The latter will be referred to as the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-18\">A principal contention of the plaintiff at the trial was that this was a \u201c supply contract \u201d so called, of such a nature as required the plaintiff to furnish the bottles needed by the defendant during the contract period and bound the defendant to take from the plaintiff, not only such as it needed, but also such \u201c as the plaintiff had reasonable ground to believe the necessities of the business might require.\u201d It is not necessary to define the duties and obligations of the respective parties to a general and unqualified contract to furnish goods needed during a specified period, for the reason that the contract at bar contained a clause governing that particular. In it was a stipulation requiring the defendant to give two months\u2019 notice of its requirements. This provision gave to the plaintiff plain and ample protection as to the quantity which it might be required to provide. Under such a contract the plaintiff would not be justified, except at its risk, in relying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>upon its own judgment as to what might be ordered when under the terms of the contract it might secure an exact statement two months in advance of all that it would be asked to furnish. Although performance of the contract was not to begin until August, it was made in the preceding February. Hence there was sufficient time within which the plaintiff could procure the necessary advices of the defendant\u2019s requirements. Failure on the part of the plaintiff to avail itself of this protecting clause does not warrant it in holding the defendant responsible for its mistaken estimate made on its own responsibility of the probable demands of the defendant. The terms of the contract plainly show that the parties guarded against liability on the part of the plaintiff to supply goods ordered on short notice, and limited its full obligation to such as were indicated by the advance notice of requirements by the defendant. But this is the extent of its provision. The various requests based upon this aspect of the case were refused rightly, and no error appears in the portion of the charge excepted to. It follows that it was not error to exclude the opinion evidence proffered by the plaintiff as to the reasonable amount of bottles which the manufacturer would need to carry in stock in order to meet the requirements of the contract based upon information as to the volume of consumption by the defendant during earlier periods.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-3\">No harmful error appears in the charge touching waiver or in the court\u2019s refusal to give the plaintiff\u2019s requests upon that subject. The parties had been dealing with each other prior to August, 1904, under a written contract which provided only that the defendant should give \u201c reasonable notice \u201d of the shipments it might need. The stipulation in the contract under discussion called for a notice two months in advance. It was a requirement binding only upon the defendant. It called for no action by the plaintiff. In a sense it was, therefore, for the benefit of the plaintiff. It was the only party to waive its advantages. If it preferred to relinquish its right under this clause and rely upon other modes of obtaining the information, it might do so. But it cannot impose another and more onerous contract upon the defendant, merely because it has failed to insist upon performance of the one which was written. There was no contention that the contract as a whole had been abrogated.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>All the exceptions which have been argued are disposed of by that which has been said. Others are treated as waived.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
