Writs dated January 15 and March 17, 1910.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b69-3\">In the Superior Court the cases were tried together before Sanderson, J. There was evidence introduced by the plaintiffs of the following facts:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b69-4\">The accident happened between eleven and twelve o\u2019clock on a dark night while the two plaintiffs were on their way from Springfield to Somerville, Connecticut, and were travelling south. It had been snowing during the evening but this nearly had ceased when the plaintiffs left Springfield, and at the time of the accident it was snowing very little. There were two or three inches of new snow on the ground. The two men were alone in the automobile, the plaintiff Keeney driving and sitting in the front seat on the right behind the glass front, which was up, and the plaintiff Renard, who was Keeney\u2019s chauffeur, sitting in the tonneau. The top of the car was up. The back curtain was on but not the side curtains. The car was equipped with electric side lights and a tail light, and with two gas headlights, all of which were lighted. Just before the accident the plaintiff Keeney was driving in the centre of the travelled way. He noticed a light, which afterwards was found to be a lantern, ahead, and, supposing it to be on the rear of a vehicle going in the same direction that he was, he turned the automobile to the left, intending to go around it. An instant later he saw that a horse and wagon were travelling north, toward him. As Keeney turned to the left the driver of the horse turned to his right. Instantly Keeney turned his steering wheel \u201c way over to the left in order to avoid him.\u201d The rear of his car skidded slightly in the wet snow and the automobile struck the horse a glancing blow near the shoulder, and as it passed him some portion of the harness or shaft caught in the top of the automobile, with the effect, not of throwing the horse down, but of turning him around with the automobile. At the instant of contact the plaintiff Keeney turned his wheel and put on his brakes so suddenly as to stall his engine, and the automobile started skidding the other way, stopping finally across the south bound or westerly track with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>the front facing the west, and with the head of the horse caught in the top of the automobile and the horse alongside of it and facing east. As the automobile stopped the top collapsed, covering the sides and the tonneau and also falling down upon the front seat. The collision did not jar or otherwise affect Keeney, nor did it damage the automobile beyond a few scratches. The horse followed the automobile around, taking the wagon with him, but the latter was not overturned or its contents disturbed in any way. Just before this accident the speed of the automobile did not exceed fifteen miles per hour. At the instant of contact with the team the speed was about six miles an hour. As soon as the automobile came to a stop the plaintiff Keeney crawled out from under the front rib of the top, which was over the back of the front seat, and got out on the left or southerly side of the automobile. He saw that the top was down over the sides of the car, blocking egress through either tonneau door. He tried the l\u00e9ft door but was unable to open it because of the position of the top, and upon going around the rear of the automobile he saw that the right door was in the same condition. At that instant he noticed up the track to the north the glare of the headlight of an approaching electric car south bound, the car then being distant over a quarter of a mile. Calling to Renard and the driver of the horse to look out for the car, he at once started running up the south bound track toward the oncoming electric car. As he got into the glare of the headlight he held up his arms and waved them. He ran a distance of about one hundred and seventy-five feet from the automobile and then was obliged to step to one side to avoid being run over. The car approached without slackening its speed and passed him while moving at a rate of at least thirty-five to forty miles an hour. As it passed he stood on the travelled way waving his hands. He immediately started back after the car and had gone a few feet when the collision with the automobile occurred, the car carrying the automobile down the track a considerable distance, and the crash being veiy severe. After the collision the car and the automobile were found to be locked together with the wagon between them in a totally demolished condition. The tonneau of the automobile was practically destroyed. Upon examination it was found to be empty and the plaintiff Renard was discovered lying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>unconscious in the snow close to the front steps of the car on the left side.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b71-3\">At the close of the plaintiffs\u2019 evidence, the judge ordered a verdict for the defendant in each case, with a stipulation of the parties that, if the ruling of the judge in ordering verdicts for the defendant was wrong, judgment should be entered for the plaintiff Keeney in the sum of $750 and for the plaintiff Renard in the sum of $2,000 ; and that, if the ruling of the judge was right, judgment should be entered on the verdicts. The plaintiffs alleged exceptions, which were allowed by the judge subject to this stipulation.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b71-4\">The cases were submitted on briefs.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b71-5\"><em>D. E. Leary, E. W. Beattie, Jr., &amp; G. D. </em>Cummings, for the plaintiffs.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b71-6\"><em>H. W. Ely </em>&amp; <em>J. B. Ely, </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b71-7\">Sheldon, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ASQJ\">Apparently it was not disputed that the plaintiffs\u2019 automobile was duly licensed in Connecticut, that they had violated none of the requirements of our statute then in force (St. 1909, c. 534, \u00a7\u00a7 3, 10), and that they were rightfully operating their machine in this Commonwealth. The rule stated in Chase v. New York Central &amp; Hudson River Railroad, 208 Mass. 137, 156, and the cases there cited, has no application here.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-11\">The jury could have found that the accident was due to negligence of the defendant\u2019s motorman in driving his car at an excessive rate of speed, in failing to observe Keeney as the latter ran up the track towards the car waving his hands and trying to attract the motorman\u2019s attention, and in not stopping his car in season to avoid running into the automobile. This is too obvious to require prolonged discussion or reference to many decisions. See <em>Lawrence </em>v. <em>Fitchburg &amp; Leominster Street Railway, </em>201 Mass. 489, 493. The cases must turn upon the question whether there was evidence that the plaintiffs were in the exercise of due care.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-12\">In our opinion there was such evidence. The fact that their machine had been thrown across the defendant\u2019s track in consequence of a collision with a horse and wagon is not decisive against them. Keeney, who was driving the automobile, had seen a light ahead of him and thought that it was on the rear of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>a vehicle going in the same direction with himself. If this had been so, his turning to the left to go around it would have been t proper. R. L. c. 54, \u00a7. 2. Nor was his mistake necessarily due to negligence. The night was dark; a little snow was falling. It was for the jury to say whether his mistake showed negligence. When he discovered his mistake, it was for the jury to say whether he acted with due care in trying to a\u2019void a collision by turning sharply to the left; and the same is true of all his management of the automobile until it came to a standstill upon the defendant\u2019s track. Nor did he then, like the plaintiff in <em>Lawrence </em>v. <em>Fitchburg &amp; Leominster Street </em>Railway, 201 Mass. 489, rely solely upon the vigilance and diligence of the motorman. According to his own testimony, he ran toward the, approaching car over a distance of nearly two hundred feet in an effort to warn the motorman and avert a collision which could be avoided only by a timely stopping of the car. We think it manifest that the issue of his due care was for the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-3\">Renard\u2019s due care was also for the jury to determine. We cannot say that any conduct of his contributed to the happening of the accident. Whether he ought to have warned Keeney before the collision with the horse and wagon, and whether he made proper efforts to get out of the automobile after the top had shut down upon him, were questions of fact upon which we cannot pass.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-4\">As the only question\u2018raised is whether the cases should have been submitted to the jury, we need not consider whether any negligence of Keeney, if such had been found, would, have been imputed to Renard also, and so would have barred a recovery by either plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">In neither of these cases should a verdict for the defendant have been ordered. It follows, under . the stipulations, that judgment must now be entered .in favor of Keeney for $750 and costs and in favor of Renard for $2,000 and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
