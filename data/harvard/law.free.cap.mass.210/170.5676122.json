The plaintiff contended that the cause of the accident was a negligent failure of the defendant to erect a barrier or fence between the track and the passageway. <em>Held, </em>that the plaintiff was not entitled to have the case submitted to the jury, because the defendant was under no obligation, either at common law or by statute, to erect or maintain a fence or barrier between its freight yard and the <em>passageway; </em>following <em>Menut </em>v. <em>Boston &amp; Maine </em>Railroad, 207 Mass. 12.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b195-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>Tort by a child three years and four months of age for injuries caused by being run over by a train of the defendant which was proceeding along a siding in Worcester. The declaration was in two counts, the first count alleging that the injury was caused by a train of the defendant running over the plaintiff and was due to \u201c negligence, carelessness and want of precaution \u201d on the part of the defendant\u2019s agents and servants, and the second count alleging as the cause of the injury neglect of the defendant \u201c to safeguard its track and premises.\u201d Writ dated November 5,1908.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b195-3\">In the Superior Court the case was tried before <em>King, </em>J.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b195-4\">It appeared that when the plaintiff was run over he was on the westerly rail of a track of the defendant in its freight yard; that five feet and seven inches west of that rail and extending parallel with it for four hundred and sixty feet was a ten foot strip which was rightfully used as a passageway by the public and which was four feet higher than the defendant\u2019s track, so that a gully was formed between it and the track. For many years there had been no guard or fence between the passageway and the railroad track.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b195-5\">Fronting on the passageway were a number of tenements and the plaintiff was the child of one of the tenants therein. The land occupied by the tenements and the passageway and the defendant\u2019s property formerly had belonged to one who had conveyed to the defendant\u2019s predecessor in title the property which it was occupying by a deed \u201c reserving \u201d to himself and his heirs and assigns \u201c the use and occupation, for all purposes except building and other obstructions to the injury of said railroad, on the strip of land \u201d which was the passageway above described.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b195-6\">An officer of the defendant, in answer to an interrogatory, \u201c If you have actual knowledge of how the accident happened, state it,\u201d stated, \u201c I am informed that the child fell under one of the car wheels. \u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b195-7\">At the close of the plaintiff\u2019s evidence, the presiding judge ordered a verdict for the defendant; and the plaintiff alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b195-8\"><em>P.

Nor is there any evidence that the gully by the side of the strip had anything to do with the accident. Upon the evidence the plaintiff must' be regarded as a trespasser at the place of the accident and therefore the defendant was not bound to anticipate his presence, and it owed him no duty except to refrain from wanton and willful misconduct toward him.

The evidence shows no such misconduct on the part of the defendant or its servants. The plaintiff failed upon his first count.</p>\n<p id=\"AeK\">Nor was there any case on the second count.
