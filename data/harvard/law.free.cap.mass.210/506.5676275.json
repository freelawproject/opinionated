Writ dated October 30,1907.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b531-6\">In the Superior Court the case was tried before Bond, J. There were double tracks of the defendant upon Charles Street which intersected at right angles double tracks on Cambridge Street, and there were switches which allowed cars to pass to and fro between the Charles Street and the Cambridge Street tracks. Other material facts are stated in the opinion. At the close of the evidence the defendant asked for the following instructions:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"ARIX\">\u201c (1) Upon all the evidence your verdict must be for the defendant upon all counts of the plaintiff\u2019s declaration.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b531-7\">\u201c (2) Upon all the evidence the plaintiff is not entitled to recover.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b531-8\">\u201c (6) Upon the fourth count of the plaintiff\u2019s declaration your verdict must be for the defendant.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b531-9\">\u201c (9) The plaintiff getting upon the left hand front step of the car assumed the risk of any injury that might happen to him <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>while he was in that position, and cannot recover for such injury.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b532-3\">\u201c (12) The plaintiff was not in the exercise of due care, if, as he stood in the street, he relied wholly upon others to see that he was not struck by a City Point car.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b532-4\">\u201c (13) The evidence does not warrant a finding that the plaintiff was in the exercise of due care.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b532-5\">\u201c (14) One who is injured by reason of his having assumed a dangerous position, cannot justify his act in getting into such position by showing that he did so to escape from other danger, unless he shows affirmatively that his getting into the other danger was not due to his failure to exercise ordinary care for his own safety.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b532-6\">\u201c (15) The evidence does not warrant a finding that the plaintiff was justified in getting upon the left hand front step of the car.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b532-7\">\u201c (16) The evidence does not warrant a finding that the plaintiff was justified in remaining upon the car of the defendant until he was struck.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b532-8\">\u201c(17) A person getting upon the left hand front step of a closed street car, with a vestibule platform and the left hand door to the front vestibule closed, while the car is operating along double tracks, is a trespasser upon the car.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b532-9\">\u201c (18) A police officer or patrolman has no more right than any private person to get upon a part of the car where he may be exposed to injury and where passengers are not invited or expected to ride.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b532-10\">\u201c (19) The plaintiff in this case was a trespasser upon the car of the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b532-11\">\u201c (20) All that the defendant is required to do with regard to a trespasser, is to abstain from wilfully, wantonly or recklessly exposing him to danger.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b532-12\">\u201c (21) The defendant and its servants owed the plaintiff no duty, except to abstain from wilfully, wantonly or recklessly exposing him to danger.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b532-13\">\u201c (22) There is no evidence warranting a finding that the defendant was guilty of wilful, wanton or reckless negligence.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b532-14\">The instructions Were refused. The jury found for the plaintiff in the sum of $2,000; and the defendant alleged ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>ceptions, which, after the death of <em>Bond, </em>J., were allowed by <em>Hitchcock, </em>J.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b533-3\"><em>A. A. Ballantine, </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b533-4\"><em>A. T.

The defendant\u2019s motorman who was operating the car was, according to his own testimony, aware of the plaintiff\u2019s presence upon the step and saw the other car approaching the switch; there seems to have been no dispute, certainly there was evidence, that the plaintiff could not get upon the platform of the car or higher up than the step on which he was standing, because the vestibule door was closed; and it could have been found that the motorman ought to have seen that there was immediate risk of a collision, but disregarded the signals of the plaintiff to open the vestibule door. No doubt other findings might have been made; and it may be that a verdict for the defendant reasonably could have been expected. But it is plain that a verdict for the defendant could not have been ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">As it could be found that it was by reason of the original negligence of the defendant\u2019s motorman that the plaintiff was compelled to take his position on the car step and to remain there until the collision, it could not be said as matter of law, whatever the jury might have found, that he assumed the risks of his position. The jury could say that he was not there of his own choice. It follows that the defendant\u2019s first, second, sixth, ninth, thirteenth, fifteenth, sixteenth, seventeenth, nineteenth and twenty-first requests were rightly refused.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>The twelfth and fourteenth requests were given in substance. The eighteenth request could not be given as framed. A police officer charged with the duty which was imposed upon the plaintiff might very probably, in order to perform faithfully his whole duty, find himself compelled to get upon a part of a car where he might be exposed to injury and where passengers are not invited or expected to ride. This was claimed to be the case here, and it presented a question of fact for the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-10\">As to the twentieth request, the jury were instructed that the plaintiff could not recover unless he was in the exercise of due care, and in substance that this would not be so unless his getting upon the step of the car was for the reason and under the necessity that he claimed. This was more favorable to the defendant than the instruction we are considering, and so the defendant has as to this no ground of complaint. For like reasons, it cannot complain of the failure to give its twenty-second request. As the case was left to the jury, nothing more than ordinary negligence on its part needed to be proved.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-20\">As the defendant\u2019s exceptions were merely to the refusal to give its requests, we need not consider whether everything which the judge said to the jury was technically correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-21\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
