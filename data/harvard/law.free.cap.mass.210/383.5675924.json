The receipt was contained in a book in which the Harry Fosdick Company took receipts for its shipments by the defendant as carrier. On the inside front cover of this book was printed, among other matters, the following;</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b409-7\">\u201c American Express Company.

The defendant excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b410-3\">It was agreed by the parties that the shipper did have implied authority to send the crank shaft and case by the defendant, but the plaintiff did not agree that there was any authority, express or implied, to limit the liability, and did not agree that there was any authority to ship at all by the defendant with a limit of liability.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b410-4\">The parties agreed that, if the measure of damages was the sum limited in the shipping receipt, judgment should be for the plaintiff in the sum of $50 and interest up to the time of the offer of judgment, or in all $53; that if the limitation of liability in the receipt was not binding on the plaintiff, there should be judgment for the plaintiff in the sum of $551.86 and interest; that, if the plaintiff was entitled to recover for the value of the loss of use, the sum of $1,500 and interest should be added; and that, if the plaintiff was entitled to recover for the lessened value on September 1, 1908, from what it was on March 1,1908, the sum of $1,000 and interest should be added.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b410-5\">There also was the following stipulation: \u201c In case the Supreme Judicial Court shall decide that there was evidence which would justify the jury in finding that there was an express or implied authority from the plaintiff or his chauffeur on the part of the shipper to limit the liability, then the case shall stand for a new trial, unless the Supreme Judicial Court shall determine that that is immaterial.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b410-6\">The judge ordered a verdict for the plaintiff in the sum of $53, and reported the case for determination by this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b410-7\"><em>E.

That authorized the Fosdick Company to make the usual shipping <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>agreement with the defendant; and all the evidence is that it did so. Certainly there was no evidence to the contrary. Accordingly the plaintiff is bound by the terms of the agreement on which the defendant received and transported the property; there was no evidence on which the plaintiff could recover more than the sum named in that agreement; and there must be judgment on the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-3\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
