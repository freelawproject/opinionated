The rule, which was printed on the time-table that the conductor showed the plaintiff, was as follows: \u201c Special information for passengers. Dogs will not be permitted in passenger coaches, but will be checked and transported in baggage cars, at owner\u2019s risk, upon payment of a minimum charge equal to 100 pounds of excess baggage for each animal.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b184-19\">The plaintiff\u2019s evidence further tended to show that at Gardner the conductor again came to the plaintiff and said: \u201c There is fifteen cents fare due on that dog. You are evading fare. The next station is Hey woods and you will have to get off; \u201d that the plaintiff thereupon put his hand in his pocket and said, \u201c If there is fifteen cents due on the dog, I will pay it,\u201d and that the conductor replied, \u201cI shan\u2019t take it. You will have to get off; \u201d that upon arriving at the next station the conductor re- \u2022 turned with the brakeman and the ticket agent and said, \u201c Are you going to get off; \u201d that the plaintiff replied, \u201c No, my ticket takes me through to Winchendon,\u201d and that the conductor replied, \u201cIt don\u2019t make any difference. You will have to get off; \u201d that the plaintiff then asked the conductor why he would have to get off and he replied, \u201c You are evading fare; \u201d that the plaintiff then said, \u201cI offered to pay the fare of the dog such as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>due,\u201d but the conductor said, \u201c It doesn\u2019t make any difference. You will have to get off, and if you don\u2019t get off, I shall arrest you; \u201d that the conductor was a railroad police officer; <footnotemark>*</footnotemark> that the plaintiff asked him what he would arrest him for, and the conductor said, \u201cFor evading fare,\u201d and thereupon put his hand upon the plaintiff\u2019s shoulder and said, \u201cUnder arrest;\u201d that the plaintiff\u2019s wife then picked up the dog and said that x she would take him into the baggage car rather than have so much trouble; that the conductor replied, \u201c It is too late. He is under arrest and has to get off; \u201d that he then motioned to the brakeman and the station agent and all three took hold of the plaintiff and pulled him down the aisle and out of the train, and that then the ticket agent took the plaintiff by the arm, led him down a public street to a square and there, in the presence of a crowd of people, demanded that the chief of police arrest the plaintiff and lock him up; that the chief of police asked why the plaintiff should be locked up and the station agent replied, \u201c For evading fare; \u201d that the plaintiff then showed the chief his tickets and explained the situation, and the chief declined to receive the plaintiff as a prisoner until the station agent should procure a warrant for his arrest; that the station agent then mingled with the people and went away, leaving the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b185-5\">At the close of the evidence, the plaintiff asked the presiding judge to give to the jury, among other instructions, an instruction that the defendant had shown no justification for the assault of its officers and agents upon the plaintiff, and that they must find for the plaintiff. The judge refused the request, and among other instructions charged the jury in substance, that while the defendant\u2019s rule as to dogs was a reasonable one which it had a right to enforce, the situation presented by the evidence did not come within that class of offenses, refusal to pay fare or noisy or disorderly conduct, that would have given the conductor a right to arrest the plaintiff; that, upon the plaintiff\u2019s refusal to have the dog in the baggage car, the defendant had a right to put him off the train at the next stopping place, using no more force in kind or degree than was reasonably necessary to effect the removal. \u25a0 \u201c It does not make any particular difference what name was given <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>to the right by the railroad officer who took the man from the car. If the doctor [the plaintiff] refused to have his dog transported in the baggage car, then there was the right of removal. And if there was no more force used in effecting the removal of the doctor from the car than was reasonably necessary, then, gentlemen, up to that point in the case, there is' no responsibility for damages. . . . Now, when Dr. Hull was upon the station platform then the rights of the railroad by way of removal were ended . . . anything further in the way of conducting the doctor through the street or streets of Gardner or any public part of Gardner for the purpose of taking him to court or to find a police officer was in excess or was unauthorized by the law in this case. And if you find that in leading or conducting the doctor through the streets of Gardner he sustained damage, then there is a right to damages in that aspect of the case. Now, you have the right if you reach this aspect of the case to take into consideration any feeling of indignity or chagrin that a man would naturally, ordinarily and reasonably feel by reason of such conduct as appears in this case.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b186-5\">The jury, in answer to special questions propounded to them by the presiding judge, found that in removing the plaintiff from the car no more force was used than was reasonably necessary, and that the plaintiff while in the car did not conduct himself in a noisy or disorderly manner.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b186-6\">The jury found for the plaintiff in the sum of $30 ; and the plaintiff alleged exceptions to the refusal to give the instruction asked for by him and to the instruction given that it did not make any particular difference what name was given by the conductor to the right to remove the plaintiff from the car.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b186-7\">H. <em>W. </em>Blake, for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b186-8\"><em>C.

S. 637. In the performance of this duty the railroad had the right to establish and enforce reasonable regulations for its own protection in the management of its business. St. 1906, c. 463, Part II, \u00a7 181. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Power, </em>7 Met. 596. <em>O\u2019Neill </em>v. <em>Lynn &amp; Boston Railroad, </em>155 Mass. 371. <em>Cutts </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>202 Mass. 450, 455.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-3\">It is common knowledge that.for various reasons, which may be either fanciful or well founded, the presence of dogs even when accompanied by their owners or custodians often causes passengers serious discomfort and annoyance, or apprehension of bodily danger; and their exclusion from its passenger coaches while permitting them to be carried for hire in the baggage cars is not an unreasonable exercise of this authority. <em>Commonwealth v. Power, 7 Met. 596, 601. Honeyman v. Oregon &amp; California Railroad, 13 Ore. 352. Gregory v. Chicago &amp; Northwestern Railway, </em>100 Iowa, 345. The plaintiff having been informed of the regulation was bound by it, and when requested by the conductor to remove the dog in his possession and control to the baggage car and to make the necessary payment, his refusal would have warranted his expulsion by the use of sufficient but not excessive force if, when the train stopped at the next station, he had refused to depart. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>174 Mass. 401. <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Concord Railroad, </em>46 N. H. 213. <em>Whitesell </em>v. <em>Crane, </em>8 W. &amp; S. 369. <em>Trotlinger v. East Tennessee, Virginia &amp; Georgia Railroad, </em>79 Tenn. 533. <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Old Colony Street Railway, </em>206 Mass. 477.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-23\">But upon the uncontradicted evidence the conductor, who also was a railroad police officer, after a somewhat prolonged colloquy with the plaintiff, instead of taking proper measures to enforce the regulation exhibited his badge of office and informed him that he was placed under arrest \u201c for evading fare.\u201d By the common law this restraint was illegal; and under R L. c. 108, \u00a7 18, authority to arrest without a warrant is conferred only where the passenger refuses to pay his fare or is noisy or disorderly. The plaintiff, however, in refusing to obey the regulation was not guilty of an evasion of his fare, and throughout the controversy he was not charged with unseemly behavior. No justification <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>having been shown for the duress and indignity to which he was subjected not only while on the train but at the station, or for the force used upon his person in removing him from the car and until he was released from custody, the defendant is responsible in damages, whether the conductor acted as its servant or as a special police officer. It also is answerable for the conduct of its brakeman and station agent who rendered assistance and participated in the assault and false imprisonment. <em>Brock </em>v. <em>Stimson, </em>108 Mass. 520, 521. <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Old Colony Street Rail</em>way, 206 Mass. 477. <em>Horgan </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated </em>Railway, 208 Mass. 287. R. L. c. 108, \u00a7 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-4\">It is therefore clear that the plaintiff\u2019s second request, 'that the defendant had shown no justification for the assault, was in accordance with the <em>evidence; </em>and the instructions to which he excepted, that the defendant would be liable only for the use of excessive force in the plaintiff\u2019s ejection and for the wrongful restraint of his liberty after he reached the station platform, were insufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">\n<em>Exceptions sustained.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
