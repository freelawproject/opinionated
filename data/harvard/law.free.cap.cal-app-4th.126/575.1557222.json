J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aqy\">Defendants Elisio Valdez and Johnnie Ray Peraza were convicted of various crimes, including the murders of Andrea Mes\u00edas and her fetus, the premeditated attempted murder of Ronny Giminez, and the false imprisonment and aggravated assault of Nancy Davis. The crimes were committed at separate times and in separate places. The prosecutor theorized that defendants went to Mestas\u2019s apartment intending to kill her boyfriend on orders from the Nuestra Familia, a prison gang. The prosecutor also presented evidence that the Nuestra Familia considered Mes\u00edas to be a \u201crat\u201d and a \u201csnitch.\u201d As to the motive for the Giminez shootings and the crimes against Davis, who was defendant Peraza\u2019s girlfriend, evidence indicated that Peraza was upset because Davis had been seeing Giminez, the father of three of her children.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-12\">Defendant Valdez was sentenced to multiple life sentences, plus a determinate term of 11 years and 8 months in prison. Defendant Peraza received multiple life sentences, plus a determinate term of 14 years in prison. On appeal, they raise numerous claims of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>In the published part of this opinion, we reject defendants\u2019 claim that (1) California\u2019s murder statute does not apply to the killing of a fetus that, even absent criminal intervention, would not have survived until birth due to a fatal physical or medical condition, and thus (2) the trial court erred in excluding evidence that Mestas\u2019s fetus suffered from such a condition. As we will explain, just as the murder statute protects human beings who are suffering from fatal conditions and have little time to live, it protects fetuses with fatal conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-4\">In the unpublished parts of our opinion, we conclude that other contentions also lack merit. However, we shall correct sentencing errors.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">FACTS AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b494-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b494-8\">Andrea Mes\u00edas was shot in the chest at very close range. A bullet perforated her heart and killed her. During the autopsy, Dr. Sally Fitterer determined that Mes\u00edas was 16 to 17 weeks pregnant with a male fetus, which perished as a result of Mestas\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-9\">In challenging their convictions for murdering a fetus, defendants contend the trial court erred by excluding evidence that, if there were no shooting, Mestas\u2019s fetus would not have survived past the second trimester because of a fatal medical condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-10\">This contention is based on the following evidence that defendant Valdez sought to introduce at trial. Microscopic examination of the placenta revealed areas of \u201cfocal necrosis or cell death.\u201d Placental autopsy slides were sent to a pathologist, who found considerable chronic inflammation of the implantation site\u2014where the placenta attaches to the uterine wall\u2014as well as acute inflammation of the membranes surrounding the fetus. The pathologist and Dr. Fitterer opined that the infection made it unlikely the fetus would have survived to term in \u00fatero. According to Dr. Fitterer, problems would have developed in the second trimester.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-11\">Defense counsel claimed that the Legislature had made a policy decision to protect fetal life because it is \u201cpotential life,\u201d which necessarily anticipates a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>live birth. Therefore, counsel argued, if medical evidence showed the fetus would not have survived to term, even absent defendants\u2019 criminal intervention, it was not potential life for purposes of a murder charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">The court ruled that evidence of the medical condition of the fetus was irrelevant and inadmissible because viability is not an element of fetal homicide. <em>(People v. Davis </em>(1994) 7 Cal.4th 797, 814-815 [30 Cal.Rptr.2d 50, 872 P.2d 591]; Pen. Code, \u00a7 187, subd. (a), further section references are to the Penal Code unless otherwise specified.)</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">On appeal, defendants contend the trial court erred because fetal viability is not the same thing as \u201csurvivability,\u201d which defendant Valdez defines as meaning the fetus likely would have completed gestation and been bom absent the criminal intervention of a third party. Relying on <em>Roe v. Wade </em>(1973) 410 U.S. 113 [35 L.Ed.2d 147, 93 S.Ct. 705] and subsequent abortion rights decisions, Valdez reiterates the position he took in the trial court that (1) the Legislature\u2019s purpose in protecting fetal fife is the protection of \u201cpotential human life,\u201d and thus (2) if a fetus has no chance of developing until birth, it is not potential life and murder of such a fetus does not fall within the proscription of section 187, subdivision (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b495-7\">Valdez even goes so far as to claim that, \u201cif interpreted to apply to the killing of a fetus which is mortally diseased, [the murder statute] violates the cmel and unusual punishment provisions of the state and federal constitutions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b495-8\">It follows, defendants argue, the court erred in excluding evidence that, even absent defendants\u2019 criminal intervention, Mestas\u2019s fetus would not have survived until birth.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-9\">For reasons that follow, the contentions lack merit, and the proffered evidence was properly excluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-10\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b495-11\">After the California Supreme Court held that the former prohibition against the unlawful killing of a human being did not encompass the murder of a fetus <em>(Keeler </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1970) 2 Cal.3d 619 [87 Cal.Rptr. 481, 470 P.2d 617]), the Legislature amended section 187, subdivision (a), to include the unlawful killing of a fetus. (Stats. 1970, ch. 1311, \u00a7 1, p. 2440.) The amended statute reads: \u201cMurder is the unlawful killing of a human being, or a fetus, with malice aforethought.\u201d (\u00a7 187, subd. (a).) It applies except when the death of the fetus resulted from a lawful abortion. (\u00a7 187, subd. (b).)</p>\n<p id=\"b496-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>The Legislature did not define \u201cfetus\u201d to be the equivalent of \u201chuman being,\u201d and it did not similarly amend section 192, which defines manslaughter as \u201cthe unlawful killing of a human being without malice.\u201d Consequently, a fetus is not a human being within the meaning of the murder statute. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Dennis </em>(1998) 17 Cal.4th 468, 505 [71 Cal.Rptr.2d 680, 950 P.2d 1035].) It is an unborn human offspring in the postembryonic period after major structures have been outlined, which typically occurs seven or eight weeks after fertilization. <em>(People v. Davis, supra, </em>7 Cal.4th at pp. 810, 814\u2014815.)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b496-4\">Although a fetus is not a human being within the meaning of the murder statute, the Legislature made the policy decision that fetal life is entitled to the same protection as human life, except where the mother\u2019s paramount privacy interests are at stake. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Dennis, supra, </em>17 Cal.4th at p. 511; <em>People v. Davis, supra, </em>7 Cal.4th at pp. 803, 809-810.)</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">In making this policy decision, the Legislature was aware that it could have limited the term \u201cfetus\u201d to \u201cviable fetus,\u201d but it did not do so. <em>(People v. Davis, supra, </em>7 Cal.4th at p. 803.) Likewise, the Legislature did not require that, to be covered by the murder statute, the fetus must not be suffering from a fatal condition that would prevent it from developing until birth. Under the plain language of section 187, subdivision (a), fetuses with terminal conditions are nonetheless fetuses protected from an unlawful killing.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">Defendants\u2019 reliance on <em>Roe v. Wade, supra, </em>410 U.S. 113 [35 L.Ed.2d 147] and its progeny is misplaced because the legal principles in those decisions are inapplicable to a statute that criminalizes the unlawful killing of a fetus without the mother\u2019s consent. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Davis, supra, </em>7 Cal.4th at p. 807.) Moreover, defendants point to nothing in those decisions to support a conclusion that the state\u2019s legitimate \u201cinterest in protecting <em>fetal life </em>or potential life\u201d <em>(Planned Parenthood v. Casey </em>(1992) 505 U.S. 833, 876 [120 L.Ed.2d 674, 714, 112 S.Ct. 2791]; italics added) does not extend to fetuses with fatal conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-7\">Despite statistical evidence disclosing that many fetuses spontaneously miscarry in the early stages of pregnancy (Comment, <em>Severe Penalties for the Destruction of \u2018Potential Life\u2019\u2014Cruel and Unusual Punishment? </em>(1995) 29 U.S.F. L.Rev. 463, 493-494), the Legislature did not limit the application of section 187, subdivision (a), to fetuses at stages of development that make them statistically more likely to survive until birth.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>Instead, as we have noted, the Legislature made the policy decision to protect fetal life in the same manner that it protects human life, except where the mother\u2019s paramount privacy interests are at stake. Section 187, subdivision (a), protects human beings who are suffering from fatal conditions and have little time to live. \u201cMurder is never more than the shortening of life; if a defendant\u2019s culpable act has significantly decreased the span of a human life, the law will not hear him say that his victim would thereafter have died in any event.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Phillips </em>(1966) 64 Cal.2d 574, 579 [51 Cal.Rptr. 225, 414 P.2d 353], disapproved on another point in <em>People </em>v. <em>Flood </em>(1998) 18 Cal.4th 470, 490, fn. 12 [76 Cal.Rptr.2d 180, 957 P.2d 869]; <em>People v. Moan </em>(1884) 65 Cal. 532, 537 [4 P. 545].) It follows that the statute likewise must be construed to protect fetuses suffering from fatal conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">We reject defendants\u2019 claim that murder of a \u201cnon-survivable\u201d fetus \u201cis a much less serious offense\u201d than murder of a human being and, thus, construing the murder statute to apply to such a fetus would violate constitutional prohibitions against cruel and unusual punishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-7\">Although not \u201ccruel or unusual\u201d in its method, a punishment may violate California\u2019s Constitution if \u201cit is so disproportionate to the crime for which it is inflicted that it shocks the conscience and offends fundamental notions of human dignity.\u201d <em>(In re Lynch </em>(1972) 8 Cal.3d 410, 424 [105 Cal.Rptr. 217, 503 P.2d 921], fn. omitted.) Factors relevant to the assessment of such a claim include (1) the nature of the offense and the offender, (2) whether more serious crimes are punished in this state less severely than the offense in question, and (3) whether the same offense is punished more severely in this state than in other jurisdictions. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 425-427.) Defendants focus on the second and third factors.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b497-8\">As to the second factor, their argument is terse. They simply state: \u201cIn California, feticide has the same punishment as murder. But killing of a non-survivable feticide [szc] is not a comparable offense to murder: it is a much less serious offense, because the non-survivable fetus is not a potential human life.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b497-9\">This comparison to the penalty for murder of a human being in California is flawed because defendants underestimate the severity of the murder of a \u201cnon-survivable\u201d fetus. As we have pointed out, the state has a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>legitimate interest in the protection of fetal life. <em>(Planned Parenthood v. Casey, supra, </em>505 U.S. at p. 876 [120 L.Ed.2d at p. 714].) \u201cThe fact that the victim murdered is an unborn child does not render defendant less culpable, or the crime less severe, in light of the Legislature\u2019s determination that . . . fetuses receive the same protection under the murder statute as persons.\u201d <em>(People v. Bunyard </em>(1988) 45 Cal.3d 1189, 1240 [249 Cal.Rptr. 71, 756 P.2d 795].)</p>\n<p id=\"b498-4\">Receiving the same protection under the murder statute means that, just as the state may penalize an act that unlawfully shortens the existence of a terminally ill human being, it may penalize an act that unlawfully shortens the existence of a fetus which later would have perished before birth due to natural causes. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Phillips, supra, </em>64 Cal.2d at p. 579; <em>People v. Moan, supra, </em>65 Cal. at p. 537.)</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">Regarding the third factor, defendants\u2019 comparison of the punishment for feticide in California to punishments for feticide in other jurisdictions fails to provide any meaningful analysis of those other laws or to demonstrate that they would not apply under the facts of this case. They simply assert \u201cCalifornia is unique in imposing murder penalties to the killing of a non-survivable fetus\u201d and, thus, it is excessively harsh to permit a conviction for murdering such a fetus.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">This assertion is undermined by our state Supreme Court\u2019s observation in <em>People </em>v. <em>Davis, supra, 1 </em>Cal.4th 797, that murder statutes in Arizona, Illinois, Louisiana, Minnesota, North Dakota, and Utah, criminalizing the nonconsensual killing of an \u201cunborn child\u201d do not require the unborn to have reached a particular stage of development. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 808.) Therefore, California is not as unique as defendants claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-7\">Moreover, the fact that \u201cCalifornia\u2019s punishment scheme is among the most extreme does not compel the conclusion that it is unconstitutionally cruel or unusual. This state constitutional consideration does not require California to march in lockstep with other states in fashioning a penal code.\u201d <em>(People v. Martinez </em>(1999) 71 Cal.App.4th 1502, 1516 [84 Cal.Rptr.2d 638].) \u201c[T]he needs and concerns of a particular state may induce it to treat certain crimes . . . more severely than any other state. . . . [\u00b6] Whether a particular punishment is disproportionate to the offense is a question of degree. The choice of fitting and proper penalty is not an exact science but a legislative skill involving an appraisal of the evils to be corrected, the weighing of practical alternatives, consideration of relevant policy factors, and responsiveness to the public will. . . . Thus, the judiciary should not interfere in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>process unless a statute prescribes a penalty \u2018 \u201cout of all proportion to the offense.\u201d \u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People v. Cooper </em>(1996) 43 Cal.App.4th 815, 827 [51 Cal.Rptr.2d 106]; see also <em>Harmelin v. Michigan </em>(1991) 501 U.S. 957, 985-986, 993-994 [115 L.Ed.2d 836, 858-859, 864, 111 S.Ct. 2680] (plur. opn. of Scalia, J.); <em>id. </em>at p. 1004 [115 L.Ed.2d at p. 871] (cone. opn. of Kennedy, J.) [the Eighth Amendment forbids only extreme sentences that are grossly disproportionate to the crime].)</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">As we have noted, our state\u2019s Legislature made a policy decision to protect fetal life in the same manner as the life of a human being, except where the mother\u2019s paramount privacy interests are at stake. In light of the state\u2019s legitimate interest in protecting fetal life, we cannot say that it is grossly disproportionate, or that it shocks the conscience or offends fundamental notions of human dignity, to punish as murder the unlawful killing of a fetus which, due to a physical or medical condition, may not otherwise survive until birth. In other words, construing California\u2019s murder statute to apply to the killing of \u201ca non-survivable fetus\u201d does not violate the cruel and/or unusual punishment clauses of the state and federal Constitutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b499-7\">In any event, defendants did not offer any evidence showing there was no possibility that medical intervention could have prevented the fetus from perishing as a result of the inflammation. Hence, they failed to establish the factual predicate for their legal claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-8\">II-XIV<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b499-9\">DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b499-10\">The judgments imposed on September 18, 2000, are modified as follows: (1) the section 186.22, subdivision (b)(1) sentence enhancements on the murders and attempted murder convictions (counts I, II, and IV) are stricken and 15-year minimum parole eligibility terms are imposed instead (\u00a7 186.22, subd. (b)(5)); (2) the stay of the section 12022.53, subdivision (d) enhancement on the fetal murder conviction (count II) is vacated; and (3) the award of 123 days of presentence conduct credits is stricken. As modified, the judgments are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>The trial court is directed to amend the abstract of judgments to reflect these modifications, and to forward certified copies of the amended abstracts to the Department of Corrections.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-4\">Davis, J., and Raye, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">The petitions of all appellants for review by the Supreme Court were denied May 11, 2005.
