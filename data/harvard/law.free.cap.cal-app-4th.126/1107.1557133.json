J.</author>\n<p id=\"APS\">Carole Ann Rucker was convicted by a jury of attempted murder involving the personal use of a firearm and great bodily injury (Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 664, 187, subd. (a), 12022.53, subd. (d), 12022.7, subd. (e)) and of exhibiting a firearm in the presence of a peace officer (Pen. Code, \u00a7 417, subd. (c)).</p>\n<p id=\"b888-5\">On appeal, Rucker contends the court erred in admitting a prior domestic violence incident under Evidence Code section 1109 because she was not in a \u201cdating relationship\u201d with the victim, the prior incident did not involve \u201cdomestic violence,\u201d and the evidence was unduly prejudicial and violated her right to due process; in ruling the prior domestic violence incident was admissible under Evidence Code section 1101, subdivision (b); in giving CALJIC No. 2.50.02 as it misled the jury on the use of prior uncharged offenses; and in failing to conduct further hearings into her claims of jury misconduct. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-6\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b888-7\">Rucker, then about 50 years old, met the victim, Hubert Watson, through an Internet dating service. About two months later, in July 2001, they had their first date. They continued to date, including dining out at restaurants, eating dinner at Watson\u2019s condominium, going to Rucker\u2019s office Christmas party and attending a wedding of one of Watson\u2019s friends. They became sexually intimate within their first two or three dates. Watson purchased some lingerie and shoes for Rucker. In early December 2001, Watson had planned to take Rucker on a weekend trip to Hawaii but the trip was cancelled because he became ill.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-8\">Watson\u2019s job as a lobbyist frequently required him to travel away from San Diego; on average he would travel three to four weeks at a time and he was away from home about 75 percent of the time. Sometimes when he was out of town, he called Rucker or sent her e-mails. In the e-mails, he told her he missed her and was looking forward to seeing her when he returned to San Diego. Rucker thought Watson might be \u201cthe one\u201d and, in late 2001 or early 2002, she wrote a list of goals that included marrying Watson in 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-9\">By April 2002, Rucker became concerned that her relationship with Watson was waning because she had not heard from him. In early May, she placed a personal advertisement in a local newspaper to meet men. She met with two of the men who answered her advertisement. Rucker and Watson last dated in late April 2002. Watson\u2019s last e-mail to Rucker was on April 30. He wrote that he appreciated her very much and would see her soon. Rucker expressed her concerns and distress about the ending of her relationship with Watson to her friend and to Watson\u2019s close friend.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1111\">*1111</page-number>About 9:00 a.m. on Memorial Day (May 27), Rucker drove to Watson\u2019s condominium complex, parked her car, observed Watson in his patio and then left. She returned about 1:00 p.m. and watched his condominium throughout the afternoon. She saw him leave with another woman. Rucker was \u201cstunned,\u201d she could not believe he wanted to spend time with someone else, and felt as if her life was falling apart. Eventually, she went to his condominium. When Watson answered the door and told her it was not a good time to visit, Rucker insisted upon coming in to meet the other woman. Watson testified Rucker was upset and told him, \u201cYou don\u2019t know what I\u2019m capable of.\u201d He considered calling 911. However, he was able to convince her to go for a drive in his car where they talked for about three hours. Among other things, Rucker talked about her prior marriage and other failed relationships. He promised to call her the next day.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-5\">Early on May 29, Rucker called a close friend of Watson\u2019s. Rucker was very upset, saying she had seen Watson with another woman, did not see a future in the relationship and wanted to kill herself. Immediately after the phone call, the friend called Watson and told him, \u201cThis psycho Carole called me again. You really need to take care of this. She wants to kill herself over you.\u201d Watson said he would take care of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-6\">Watson called Rucker at work and briefly talked to her about how she was doing. Rucker asked to come by that evening to pick up some shoes that were at his condominium. He said that was fine.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-7\">Rucker arrived about 5:40 p.m. In her purse, she was carrying her gun. Normally, Rucker carried the gun under the front passenger seat of her car. She did not carry the gun in her purse when she ran errands, such as shopping, and had not previously carried the gun into Watson\u2019s home. She testified she carried the gun when she went to the gym and that she was planning to go the gym after seeing Watson.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-8\">When Rucker asked for wine, Watson poured her a glass. Rucker sipped the wine \u201c[v]ery quickly\u201d and when she was on her third glass she announced, \u201cNow I have to stay for dinner. Now I can\u2019t leave and I have to stay for dinner because if I get stopped for drunk driving, you will be liable because you served me alcohol.\u201d Watson started to prepare dinner. While in the kitchen, Rucker put her arm around his neck, nuzzled him, and said, \u201cTake me like a man,\u201d a statement which echoed comments she had made the previous day that he \u201ccould be rougher with her.\u201d They went to the bedroom and engaged in sex. He was rougher and said, \u201cCan you take it [like] a woman?\u201d at which point Rucker began to cry. She said, \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1112\">*1112</page-number>said that.\u201d Watson was confused because she had not indicated he was hurting her, that sex was uncomfortable or that she wanted him to stop. He stopped. Rucker dressed, left the bedroom, went to her purse and pulled out her gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-4\">As Watson walked down the hallway, Rucker shot him. She followed him outside through the front door, where he collapsed to the ground. She shot Watson twice more while he was on the ground. She then put the gun in her mouth and pulled the trigger, but the gun did not discharge. She looked at the gun and again put the gun in her mouth. Again the gun did not discharge; she had fired all six bullets from the gun at Watson. At the time of trial, Watson still had three bullets in his body; two near his spine and one in his leg. He was \u201clucky to be alive.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b890-5\">Rucker drove home with the intent of getting additional bullets. The police followed her. She parked in her usual space and was surrounded by the police, who had their guns drawn. She got out of the car with her gun in her hand and pointed it at a police officer. The officer shot her several times.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-6\">\n<em>Prior Domestic Violence Incident</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b890-7\">For about two and a half years between 1996 and 1998, Rucker dated David Yu. She believed it was a good relationship with a future. In December 1998, Yu did not invite Rucker to his office Christmas party, as he had in the past, telling her he was going to be out of town. Rucker \u201ccrashed\u201d the party, saw Yu was there with his friends and became \u201c[d]istraught, sick to [her] stomach, [and] traumatized.\u201d Because she was drunk and asked for a ride, Yu drove Rucker to her home in her car. Yu spent the night and they engaged in sexual relations. The next morning Yu told her that he no longer wanted to see her. Rucker drove Yu home.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-8\">Later that day, Rucker called Yu and said she wanted to talk. Yu told her that he did not want to see her and hung up. About an hour later, Rucker showed up at his apartment. When he told her he had to go someplace and did not want to talk, she took out a handgun and said, \u201cPlease let me in. You know I know how to use this.\u201d Yu allowed her into his home, spoke with her and calmed her down. After awhile Rucker handed the gun to Yu. The gun was loaded. He returned the gun to her before she left.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-9\">Over the next two years Rucker harassed Yu by various means, including putting paint on his car, supergluing his car door locks, taking a windshield wiper from his car, and painting an obscenity on the sidewalk outside a friend\u2019s home where he had been attending a party. Yu talked with Rucker, asking her to stop. She said she did not mean to harm him, she was only trying to get his attention and would stop. She did not stop.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1113\">*1113</page-number>On July 3, 2000, Rucker chased Yu and a woman he was dating. The chase included high speeds on the freeway. Yu tried to evade Rucker but, because he thought the situation was dangerous, he pulled into a parking lot. Rucker followed him into the parking lot. Yu confronted Rucker and told her to leave him alone. She claimed she had not been following him, she was just driving to the store to make a purchase. A few days later in a telephone call, Rucker told Yu if she could not have him, no one could, a statement that prompted Yu to call the police. He obtained a restraining order against her, which stopped the harassment.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-5\">One of Rucker\u2019s former coworkers testified Rucker stated she was \u201cvery upset and hurt\u201d by the way Yu had treated her and had wanted to kill him when she pulled out the gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-6\">\n<em>Defense</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b891-7\">Rucker testified that on May 29 she intended to go to Watson\u2019s condominium only to pick up her shoes. She did not hate Watson and did not feel ill will toward him. She was confused when he offered her a glass of wine and was treating the situation as a social visit. She drank the wine to help her relax while he was on the phone for 20 to 25 minutes and did not realize how much she had drunk. She did ask him to \u201ctake [her] like a man,\u201d meaning he should be romantic and passionate. When they were in the bedroom, he raped her, refusing to stop when she told him he was hurting her and asked him to stop. He seemed to be getting pleasure out of hurting her and looked at her \u201cwith this evil smirking.\u201d The incident triggered memories of past rapes and she started crying. At this point, he jumped away, was angry, yelled at her about what did she mean when she said she wanted him to take her like a man, and stormed out of the bedroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-8\">Rucker did not remember getting the gun out of her purse. She remembered firing twice in his general direction inside the condominium and she remembered going outside but had no memory of shooting him again. She did remember twice putting the gun in her mouth and driving home to get more bullets. She denied trying to kill Watson or that she felt ill will toward him.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-9\">She was unsure if she remembered the police following her to her condominium. She remembered having the gun in her hand when she got out of her car but she did not remember pointing it at the police. She took her gun out of the car \u201c[b]ecause it was [her] security blanket,\u201d she had \u201cowned it a long time,\u201d and if she was going to die, \u201cit was going to be with [her].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b892-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1114\">*1114</page-number>Rucker\u2019s blood-alcohol level was .11 percent about an hour and a half after the shooting. A person with that alcohol level could experience a loss of critical judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-4\">Rucker presented expert testimony indicating that she suffered from a borderline personality disorder, which could involve the \u201ccapacity to regress emotionally very quickly and very dramatically\u201d; she suffered from depression; she was in a \u201cdisassociative [ric] state\u201d triggered by the rape when she shot Watson, and she \u201cseemed remarkably unangry\u201d toward Watson.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b892-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b892-7\">\n<em>Admission of Prior Domestic Violence Under Evidence Code Section 1109</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b892-9\">Rucker contends the court erred in admitting details of the prior Yu incident because she did not have a \u201cdating relationship\u201d with Watson, her relationship with Yu did not involve violence, the Yu incident was too dissimilar to the charged offense to warrant admission, and the court abused its discretion in not excluding the evidence pursuant to Evidence Code section 352.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-10\">Under Evidence Code section 1109, evidence of a prior act of domestic violence is admissible to prove the defendant had a propensity to commit domestic violence when the defendant is charged with an offense involving domestic violence. The trial court has discretion to exclude the evidence if its probative value is outweighed by a danger of undue prejudice or confusing the jury, or would result in an undue consumption of time. (Evid. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 1109, subd. (a)(1), 352.)</p>\n<p id=\"b892-11\">\u201cDomestic violence,\u201d for the purposes of Evidence Code section 1109, is broadly defined as \u201cabuse committed against an adult or a minor who is a spouse, former spouse, cohabitant, former cohabitant, or person with whom the suspect has had a child or is having or has had a dating or engagement relationship.\u201d (Pen. Code, \u00a7 13700, subd. (b); Evid. Code, \u00a7 1109, subd. (d).) \u201cAbuse\u201d is defined as \u201cintentionally or recklessly causing or attempting to cause bodily injury, or placing another person in reasonable apprehension of imminent serious bodily injury to himself or herself, or another.\u201d (Pen. Code, \u00a7 13700, subd. (a); see Evid. Code, \u00a7 1109, subd. (d).)</p>\n<p id=\"b892-12\">\n<em>(A) Dating Relationship with Watson</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b892-13\">Rucker concedes she and Watson \u201cobviously had a \u2018dating relationship\u2019 in some sense of the term,\u201d but contends it was \u201ctoo casual to be a \u2018dating relationship\u2019 within the meaning of the relevant domestic violence statutes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b893-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1115\">*1115</page-number>Rucker relies heavily on <em>Oriola </em>v. <em>Thaler </em>(2000) 84 Cal.App.4th 397 [100 Cal.Rptr.2d 822] <em>(Oriola), </em>where the court considered the meaning of the phrase \u201cdating relationship\u201d in the context of an application for a restraining order under the Domestic Violence Prevention Act (DVPA). (Fam. Code, \u00a7 6200 et seq.) Like Evidence Code section 1109, the DVPA applies to \u201cdating or engagement\u201d relationships. (Fam. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 6301, subd. (a), 6211.) The <em>Oriola </em>court believed it was necessary to judicially create a definition of \u201cdating relationship\u201d because the Legislature had not defined the phrase and, according to the <em>Oriola </em>court, \u201cthe meaning of a \u2018dating relationship\u2019 is not clear enough to delineate the particular meaning the Legislature had in mind when it used these words.\u201d <em>(Oriola, supra, </em>84 Cal.App.4th at p. 407, fn. omitted.) The court first reviewed the history of dating. The court then looked at statutes in other states, which had definitions of a \u201cdating relationship.\u201d These statutes defined a dating relationship in terms of \u201cfrequent, intimate associations primarily characterized by the expectation of affectional involvement\u201d (Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. \u00a7 600.2950(30)(a)); \u201cfrequent, intimate associations primarily characterized by the expectation of affectional or sexual involvement\u201d (Nev. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 33.018(2)); and \u201ca social relationship of a romantic nature,\u201d a determination that could be based on such factors as: \u201c(a) [t]he length of time the relationship has existed; (b) the nature of the relationship; and (c) the frequency of interaction between the parties\u201d (Wash. Rev. Code \u00a7 26.50.010(3)). Several states had definitions of what did not constitute a dating relationship. The statutes specified a dating relationship did not \u201cinclude a casual relationship or an ordinary fraternization between 2 individuals in a business or social context.\u201d (Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. \u00a7 600.2950(30)(a); see 725 Ill. Comp. Stat. \u00a7 5/112A-3(3) [essentially identical language]; see Nev. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 33.018(2) [essentially identical language].)</p>\n<p id=\"b893-5\">After reviewing the history of dating and statutory definitions in other states, the <em>Oriola </em>court created the following definition: \u201c[F]or purposes of the [DVPA], a \u2018dating relationship\u2019 refers to serious courtship. It is a social relationship between two individuals who have or have had a reciprocally amorous and increasingly exclusive interest in one another, and shared expectation of the growth of that mutual interest, that has endured for such a length of time and stimulated such frequent interactions that the relationship cannot be deemed to have been casual.\u201d <em>(Oriola, supra, </em>84 Cal.App.4th. at p. 412.)</p>\n<p id=\"b893-6\">The court concluded a \u201cdating relationship\u201d had not been established in the case before it since the parties went on only four social outings, were alone only on one outing, the appellant had told the respondent after the first date that she was not interested in a romantic relationship, the relationship was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1116\">*1116</page-number>relatively brief, and the appellant in a police report had made it clear she was not the respondent\u2019s \u201cgirlfriend\u201d but was an \u201cacquaintance.\u201d <em>(Oriola, supra, </em>84 Cal.App.4th. at p. 412.)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b894-4\">After <em>Oriola </em>was decided, the Legislature enacted a definition of \u201cdating relationship\u201d in the DVPA: \u201c \u2018Dating relationship\u2019 means frequent, intimate associations primarily characterized by the expectation of affection or sexual involvement independent of financial considerations.\u201d (Fam. Code, \u00a7 6210.) The same definition of \u201cdating relationship\u201d appears in Penal Code section 243, subdivision (f)(10) defining the offense of battery. Thus, Rucker\u2019s reliance on <em>Oriola\u2019s </em>definition of a dating relationship is misplaced, since it predates the Legislative definition.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-5\">The definition of a dating relationship adopted by the Legislature does not require \u201cserious courtship,\u201d an \u201cincreasingly exclusive interest,\u201d \u201cshared expectation of growth,\u201d or that the relationship endures for a length of time. <em>(Oriola, supra, </em>84 Cal.App.4th at p. 412.) The statutory definition requires \u201cfrequent, intimate associations,\u201d a definition that does not preclude a relatively new dating relationship. The Legislature was entitled to conclude the domestic violence statutes should apply to a range of dating relationships. The Legislature could reasonably conclude dating relationships, even when new, have unique emotional and privacy aspects that do not exist in other social or business relat\u00fa nships and those aspects may lead to domestic violence early in a relationship. An individual who engages in domestic violence may have a pattern of abuse that carries over from short-term relationship to short-term relationship. As the legislative history of Evidence Code section 1109 indicates, the Legislature recognized domestic violence is an ongoing problem. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Hoover </em>(2000) 77 Cal.App.4th 1020, 1027-1028 [92 Cal.Rptr.2d 208], quoting Assem. Com. on Public Safety, Rep. on Sen. Bill No. 1876 (1995-1996 Reg. Sess.) June 25, 1996, pp. 3-4 [\u201c \u2018The propensity inference is particularly appropriate in the area of domestic violence because on-going violence and abuse is the norm in domestic violence cases. Not only is there a great likelihood that any one battering episode is part of a larger scheme of dominance and control, that scheme usually escalates in frequency and severity. Without the propensity inference, the escalating nature of domestic violence is likewise masked.\u2019 \u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b895-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1117\">*1117</page-number>Moreover, even if the statutory definition did not exist and did not conflict with the <em>Oriola </em>court\u2019s definition, we would not be bound by the <em>Oriola </em>definition; the <em>Oriola </em>court\u2019s definition is mere dictum in light of the facts of the case. The relationship at issue in <em>Oriola </em>was clearly, by any reasonable person\u2019s definition, not a dating relationship. The parties had had only four social outings, only one of them alone; at the outset of the relationship the appellant had made it clear she did not want a romantic relationship with the respondent and had characterized herself as an acquaintance, not a girlfriend. In other words, the parties were, at most \u201cjust friends,\u201d and not in a dating relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-5\">While the <em>Oriola </em>court\u2019s definition of a \u201cdating relationship\u201d does not accord with the Legislature\u2019s definition to the extent the <em>Oriola </em>court required \u201cserious courtship,\u201d and \u201cincreasingly exclusive interest,\u201d and a \u201cshared expectation of growth,\u201d the <em>Oriola </em>court\u2019s conclusion that a \u201cdating relationship\u201d does not include \u201ca casual relationship or an ordinary fraternization between [two] individuals in a business or social context\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> does accord with the statutory definition.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-6\">Here, as we noted above, Rucker concedes she had a dating relationship with Watson; she only argued that it was too \u201ccasual\u201d to meet the definition outlined in <em>Oriola. </em>As we have explained, we find the <em>Oriola </em>definition to be unduly narrow. There is substantial evidence in the record to support a finding her relationship with Watson was a \u201cdating relationship\u201d within the meaning of the statutory definition and not merely a casual business or social relationship. Rucker and Watson had frequent, intimate associations when Watson was in town over a period of approximately nine months and he communicated his affection to her when he was out of town. The relationship was characterized by the expectation of affection and sexual involvement. Watson testified it was a \u201cdating relationship.\u201d Rucker believed it was a serious relationship, possibly leading to marriage.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-7\">In sum, there was substantial evidence in the record to support the predicate finding she and Watson had a \u201cdating relationship\u201d within the meaning of Evidence Code section 1109.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-8\">\n<em>(B) Prior Incident Involved Domestic Violence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b895-9\">Rucker contends evidence relating to Yu should not have been admitted because no \u201cdomestic violence\u201d occurred. Rucker points out that Yu testified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1118\">*1118</page-number>he was not \u201cas scared initially when it actually happened.\u201d She also points out that when Yu asked for the gun, she gave it to him and he handed it back to her when she left.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-4\">Domestic violence is defined as including \u201cintentionally or recklessly causing or attempting to cause bodily injury, or placing another person in reasonable apprehension of imminent serious bodily injury to himself or herself, or another.\u201d (Pen. Code, \u00a7 13700, subd. (a); see Evid. Code, \u00a7 1109, subd. (d).)</p>\n<p id=\"b896-5\">Essentially, Rucker is challenging the sufficiency of the evidence to support a finding she engaged in a violent act. There is no question that her act in pointing the gun at Yu when he refused to talk to her constituted a violent act. Such conduct could have been punished as an assault with a firearm. (See Pen. Code, \u00a7 245, subd. (a)(2); <em>People v. Colantuono </em>(1994) 7 Cal.4th 206, 219 [26 Cal.Rptr.2d 908, 865 P.2d 704] [\u201cAs this court explained more than a century ago, \u2018Holding up a fist in a menacing manner, drawing a sword, or bayonet, presenting a gun at a person who is within its range, have been held to constitute an assault.\u2019 \u201d].) An assault with a deadly weapon is a \u201cviolent felony.\u201d (Pen. Code, \u00a7 667.5, subd. (c)(8).) Such an act is clearly encompassed within the domestic violence definition of \u201cintentionally or recklessly causing or attempting to cause bodily injury, or placing another person in reasonable apprehension of imminent serious bodily injury to himself or herself, or another.\u201d (Pen. Code, \u00a7 13700, subd. (a); see Evid. Code, \u00a7 1109, subd. (d).)</p>\n<p id=\"b896-6\">To the extent Rucker argues no domestic violence occurred because Yu was not scared and she turned the gun over to him, we are unpersuaded. Yu testified that he was scared when she pointed the gun, became more frightened after she left and, in hindsight, believed he should have called the police at the outset. Additionally, there was evidence indicating that when she drew the gun, she had wanted to kill Yu.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Finally, we note that the fact she eventually handed the gun to Yu and he kept it in his possession until she left says more about Yu\u2019s abilities to pacify her than about the violence of Rucker\u2019s act of pointing her gun at him and reminding him that she knew how to use it.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1119\">*1119</page-number>Moreover, Rucker\u2019s confrontation of Yu with the gun was only the beginning of a two-year campaign of harassment and stalking that culminated in a dangerous high-speed chase and a threat to Yu that if Rucker could not have him, no one could.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-5\">We conclude there was substantial evidence to support the predicate finding Rucker had engaged in domestic violence against Yu.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-6\">\n<em>(C) Prior Incident Was Properly Admitted over an Evidence Code Section 352 Objection</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b897-7\">Rucker contends the prior Yu incident should have been excluded pursuant to Evidence Code section 352 because there were \u201cglaring dissimilarities\u201d between the two incidents, and therefore any probative value of the Yu incident was outweighed by a danger of undue prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-8\">Under Evidence Code section 352, the court has discretion to exclude relevant evidence \u201c \u2018if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the probability that its admission will (a) necessitate undue consumption of time or (b) create substantial danger of undue prejudice, of confusing the issues, or of misleading the jury.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Robinson v. Grossman </em>(1997) 57 Cal.App.4th 634, 647 [67 Cal.Rptr.2d 380].) \u201c \u2018The \u201cprejudice\u201d referred to in Evidence Code section 352 applies to evidence which uniquely tends to evoke an emotional bias against defendant as an individual and which has very little effect on the issues. In applying section 352, \u201cprejudicial\u201d is not synonymous with \u201cdamaging.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(People v. Bolin </em>(1998) 18 Cal.4th 297, 320 [75 Cal.Rptr.2d 412, 956 P.2d 374].) Relevant factors in determining prejudice include whether the prior acts of domestic violence were more inflammatory than the charged conduct, the possibility the jury might confuse the prior acts with the charged acts, how recent were the prior acts, and whether the defendant had already been convicted and punished for the prior offense(s). (See <em>People v. Poplar </em>(1999) 70 Cal.App.4th 1129, 1139 [83 Cal.Rptr.2d 320]; <em>People v. Jennings </em>(2000) 81 Cal.App.4th 1301, 1315 [97 Cal.Rptr.2d 727].)</p>\n<p id=\"b897-9\">Rucker asserts the Yu incident was not relevant to show she premeditated and deliberated the attempted murder of Watson. She states \u201c[t]he two uses of the same firearm could not have been more disparate,\u201d reasoning: \u201cIn the Yu case, [she] used the gun as a means of talking to Yu, who otherwise refused to talk to her the day after he had spent the night with her, and her meekly handing him the gun when he asked for it does not illustrate she \u2018was prepared to engage in premeditated acts of violence.\u2019 Watson, on the other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1120\">*1120</page-number>hand, was apparently unaware the gun was even in his house until the moment he was shot.\u201d We disagree and find there are remarkable similarities between the prior incident and charged offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-4\">In both situations Rucker had been dating the victim for a substantial period of time, she reacted to the ending of the relationship by confronting the victim with a gun at the victim\u2019s residence, and there was evidence showing Rucker pointed the gun at the victim with an intent to harm or kill the victim. Also in both situations, she engaged in stalking the victim\u2014with Yu, the stalking occurred over a two-year period; with Watson, the stalking occurred just prior to the shooting when she staked out his residence and covertly watched him from her car.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-5\">The fact Watson was unaware of the gun prior to the shooting does not render the two situations unduly disparate. The relevance of the Yu incident was to show Rucker reacted violently to a relationship breaking up and to undermine her claim she became violent because Watson raped her. The fact Rucker did not shoot Yu, as she did Watson, does not necessarily lead to a conclusion she had no intent to harm Yu; instead a reasonable inference may be drawn that she did not shoot Yu only because he was sufficiently adept at pacifying her.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-6\">Introduction of the evidence was not unduly prejudicial. The Yu incident was relatively recent. Rucker confronted Yu with the gun in December 1998 and continued to harass and threaten him until July 2000. She began dating Watson about a year later, in July 2001. There is no evidence suggesting she had any significant intervening relationship. Proof of the Yu incident was straightforward; the evidence was essentially undisputed. The Yu incident was not inflammatory compared to the charged offense. Unlike the charged offense, Rucker never fired her gun at Yu or otherwise made an actual attempt to kill him. There was no reasonable probability the jury might confuse the two incidents. The fact the jury was unable to reach a unanimous verdict on the allegation that she had acted with premeditation and deliberation tends to show the jury did not convict her based on having been inflamed by the prior incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-7\">\n<em>(D) Admission of the Evidence Did Not Violate Due Process</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b898-9\">Rucker contends the use of prior uncharged acts as propensity evidence violated her right to due process. She acknowledges, however, the Supreme Court has rejected this argument <em>(People v. Falsetta </em>(1999) 21 Cal.4th 903, 917 [89 Cal.Rptr.2d 847, 986 P.2d 182]) and we are bound by its decision <em>(Auto Equity Sales, Inc. v. Superior Court </em>(1962) 57 Cal.2d 450, 455 [20 Cal.Rptr. 321, 369 P.2d 937]).</p>\n<p id=\"b899-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1121\">*1121</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b899-5\">\n<em>Admission Under Evidence Code Section 1101, Subdivision (b)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b899-7\">Evidence Code section 1101, subdivision (b) permits evidence of a prior uncharged offense to prove a disputed issue such as intent. Rucker contends the Yu incident was not admissible to prove intent because it was too dissimilar to the charged offense. We have already addressed and rejected this argument.

Rucker contends the instruction created \u201can illogical permissive inference\u201d in this case because the two incidents were greatly disparate.
