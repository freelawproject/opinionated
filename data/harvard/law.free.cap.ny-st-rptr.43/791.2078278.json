Klee one of the-plaintiffs; and plaintiffs\u2019 counsel rested his case. Whereupon,, defendant\u2019s counsel made a motion to dismiss the complaint for want of sufficient evidence to sustain plaintiffs\u2019 case, and the trial justice thereupon granted the motion to dismiss, to which ruling plaintiffs\u2019 counsel excepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-9\">We think that there was no error on the part of the trial justice-in granting the motion to dismiss. It was the duty of the plaintiffs to furnish sufficient and competent evidence to the court and jury to maintain their cause of action, and in the absence of such evidence it was clearly the duty of the court to dismiss the. complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-10\">The evidence given by the witness Klee upon his cross-examinatian was. so inconsistent and at variance with that given upon his-, direct examination that we think the trial justice was fully justified in granting the motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-11\">To maintain their action it was necessary for plaintiffs to prove by a preponderance of evidence that on the 26th day of August,, 1887, the time of the seizure, the plaintiffs had the right to reduce the goods in suit into their possession; at the time of the seizure-by the sheriff the plaintiffs were not entitled to reduce the goods into their possession, as they had made no demand therefor upon. , Rothschild.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-12\">The evidence was insufficient to justify a verdict for the plaintiffs, and hence the dismissal was not error.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-13\">Had the case been submitted to the jury and a verdict rendered for the plaintiffs upon the evidence before the court, this court would feel constrained to set aside such verdict as clearly against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"793\">*793</page-number>the weight of evidence, and will assume that the court below would have set it aside for the same reason..</p>\n<p id=\"b833-3\">Judgment appealed from must, therefore, be affirmed, with costs to the respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-4\">Yah Wyok and Fitzsimons, JJ., concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
