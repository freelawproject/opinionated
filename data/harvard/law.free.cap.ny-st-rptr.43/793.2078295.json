The trial justice excluded all such proposed testimony. In our opinion his rulings in this respect were clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-16\">As above indicated, the testimony shows that the note in suit was received by plaintiffs and applied by them in payment of a pre-existing debt; it does not appear that at the time of such acceptance they parted with value or relinquished some right because of the endorsement over to them of said note. Under these circumstances they received the note subject to any and all \u2022defenses which might have been urged against their endorser Byrne. <em>Prince et al. </em>v. <em>The Never Rip Jersey Co., </em>37 St. Rep., .677.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-17\">Therefore it was error for the trial justice to exclude the testimony \u201coffered by defendant McNiece tending to show that the note was obtained by false representations and without value.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-18\">J udgment reversed and new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide event of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-19\">McG-own and Yan Wyok, JJ., concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
