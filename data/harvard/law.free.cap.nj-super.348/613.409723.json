The arbitrator determined that both parties were responsible for the accident, and assigned 80% liability to the defendant. The arbitrator also determined that plaintiffs damages were $50,000. Accordingly, the arbitrator entered a molded arbitration award in favor of plaintiff for $40,000 exclusive of prejudgment interest. On July 27, 2000, plaintiff filed a demand for a trial de novo. However, plaintiff failed to serve the demand upon defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">On September 20, 2000, defendant moved to dismiss plaintiffs complaint with prejudice on the ground that plaintiff had failed either to serve a demand for a trial de novo or to file a motion for confirmation of the arbitration award. The motion was supported by a certification of defendant\u2019s counsel, who stated that he first learned plaintiff had filed a demand for a trial de novo when he called the Essex County Court House on September 15, 2000, to inquire about the status of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">Plaintiffs counsel submitted a certification in opposition to the motion which admitted that defendant\u2019s counsel \u201cwas inadvertently not provided with a copy of\u2019 the demand for a trial de novo. In addition, plaintiffs counsel alleged that he told defendant\u2019s counsel immediately after the end of the arbitration hearing that \u201cwe would definitely de novo the award.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Defendant\u2019s counsel filed a reply certification denying that such a conversation occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-7\">The trial court granted defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss, noting that <em>Rule </em>4:21A-6(b)(1) requires a demand for a trial de novo not only to be filed with the court but also to be served on all other parties to the action, and that this court held in <em>Jones v. First </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number><em>Nat\u2019l Supermarkets, Inc., </em>329 <em>N.J.Super. </em>125, 746 A.2d 1072 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>165 <em>N.J. </em>132, 754 A.2d 1209 (2000), that this requirement should be strictly enforced. The court stated that even if plaintiffs counsel told defendant\u2019s counsel that he planned to demand a trial de novo, this did not shift the burden to opposing counsel \u201cto ferret out\u201d whether such a demand actually had been filed. Plaintiff filed a motion for reconsideration of the dismissal of her complaint, which the trial court also denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-4\"><em>Rule </em>4:21A-6(b) provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-5\">(b) Dismissal. An order shall be entered dismissing the action following the filing of the arbitrator\u2019s award unless:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-6\">(1) within 30 days after filing of the arbitration award, a party thereto files with the civil division manager <em>and serves on all other parties </em>a notice of rejection of the award and demand for a trial de novo and pays a trial de novo fee as set forth in paragraph (e) of this rule; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-7\">(3) within 50 days after the filing of the arbitration award, any party moves for confirmation of the arbitration award and entry of judgment thereon.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-8\">[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b646-9\">In <em>Jones v. First Nat\u2019l Supermarkets, Inc., supra, </em>329 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 127, 746 A.2d 1072, we held that because \u201c[t]he express language of <em>R. </em>4:21A-6(b)(1) provides that both filing and service of the demand must be accomplished within thirty days of the entry of an arbitration awardf,] ... the requirement of [such] service should be strictly enforced.\u201d However, in <em>Corcoran v. St. Peter\u2019s Med. Ctr., </em>339 <em>N.J.Super. </em>337, 339, 771 A.2d 707 (App.Div.2001), we also held that \u201cthe substantial compliance doctrine applies to service of a demand for a trial de novo.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b646-10\">A party asserting substantial compliance with the requirements of a statute or court rule must show:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-11\">(1) the lack of prejudice to the defending party; (2) a series of steps taken to comply with the statute [or rule] involved; (3) a general compliance with the purpose of the statute [or rule]; (4) a reasonable notice of petitioner\u2019s claim, and (5) a reasonable explanation why there was not a strict compliance with the statute [or rale].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-12\"><em>[Alan J. Cornblatt, P.A. v. Barow, </em>153 <em>N.J. </em>218, 239, 708 A.2d 401 (1998) (quoting <em>Bernstein v. Board of Trs. of Teachers' Pension &amp; Annuity Fund, </em>151 <em>N.J.Super. </em>71, 76-77, 376 A.2d 563 (App.Div.1977)).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b647-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>In <em>Corcoran, </em>we held that a defendant which mistakenly served its demand for a trial de novo upon plaintiffs original counsel instead of its substituted counsel had substantially complied with the service requirement of the court rule. We concluded that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-5\">defendant took a \u201cseries of steps\u201d to comply with <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:23A-26 and <em>Rule </em>4:21A-6(b)(1) by both filing and serving its demand within the prescribed thirty day time, and that those actions constituted \u201cgeneral compliance with the purpose of the statute!,]\u201d which is to require a prompt demand for a trial de novo in cases subject to mandatory arbitration.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-6\"><em>[Id. </em>at 343-44, 771 A.2d 707 (citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b647-7\">We also concluded that defendant provided a</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AZS\">\u201creasonable explanation\u201d for its failure to strictly comply with the service requirement. Even if defendant\u2019s counsel received a fully executed and filed substitution of attorney in April 1999, it is easy to understand how a secretary assigned responsibility for serving a copy of a demand for a trial de novo could mistakenly mail the document to a party\u2019s original attorney, whose name would appear on the first pleading and probably also the cover of the case file.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-8\"><em>[Id. </em>at 344, 771 A.2d 707.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b647-9\">In contrast, plaintiff did not take any steps to satisfy the requirement that a demand for a trial de novo be served upon the opposing party. Plaintiff did not simply make a mistake in serving its demand upon an opposing party\u2019s prior attorney; it completely failed to serve the demand upon anyone. Even if plaintiffs counsel gave his adversary oral notice of an intention to file a demand for a trial de novo, this would not constitute substantial compliance with the service requirement. It is not unusual for an attorney or party to express an intent to take further legal action immediately after a hearing or trial but then, after an opportunity for further reflection, to have a change of mind. Consequently, such an expression of future intent is not equivalent to notice that further legal action actually has been initiated. Moreover, oral notice is not an adequate substitute for service of a written pleading. As this case illustrates, a person\u2019s recollection of giving or receiving oral notice may be fallible, and if we were to hold that oral notice could constitute substantial compliance with a service requirement, this would necessitate an evidentiary hearing any time there was a dispute as to whether such notice had been given. Therefore, we conclude that the oral <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>notice plaintiffs counsel allegedly gave defendant\u2019s counsel of an intent to file a demand for a trial de novo did not constitute \u201ca series of steps taken to comply\u201d with the service requirement or \u201cgeneral compliance with the purpose\u201d of this requirement. <em>Cornblatt, supra, </em>153 <em>N.J. </em>at 239, 708 A.2d 401.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-4\">Furthermore, plaintiff failed to provide \u201ca reasonable explanation why there was not a strict compliance\u201d with the service requirement. <em>Ibid. </em>In fact, the certification plaintiff submitted in opposition to defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss did not include any explanation for the failure to serve the demand for a trial de novo upon defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b645-8\"> We note that plaintiff did not seek an extension of time to move for coniirmation of the arbitration award as alternative relief in the event the trial court concluded she was not entitled to a trial de novo. See <em>Allen v. Heritage Court Assocs., </em>325 <em>N.J.Super. </em>112, 737 A.2d 1158 (App.Div.1999). Plaintiff's counsel confirmed at oral argument before us that he deliberately elected not to seek such relief.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
