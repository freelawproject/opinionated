The sole issue is whether FMC\u2019s suit is barred by the four-year statute of limitations under Article 2 of the Uniform Commercial Code, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>12A:2-725 (\u00a7 2-725). Following the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Assocs. Discount Corp. v. Palmer, </em>47 <em>N.J. </em>183, 219 A.2d 858 (1966), we conclude that the action is barred and accordingly reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-13\">The central facts are undisputed. On January 31, 1994, defendant purchased a 1988 Dodge van from Liecardi Motors Inc. for a price of $7,928.70. As part payment, defendant executed a retail installment contract financing a total of $7,750.59. The agreement provided for thirty-five monthly payments of $333.04. The agreement was assigned to FMC.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-14\">At some point defendant defaulted on the payments due under the contract and, on March 21, 1995, he voluntarily surrendered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>the vehicle to FMC. FMC sold the vehicle at public auction for $3,195.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">On September 29, 2000, approximately five and one-half years after defendant defaulted, FMC filed an action seeking to recover the deficiency owed under the retail installment contract. FMC moved for summary judgment. Defendant cross-moved for summary judgment and requested oral argument, claiming that FMC\u2019s suit was barred by the four-year statute of limitations under \u00a7 2-725. Without a hearing and without making any findings, the trial court granted summary judgment to FMC.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">Before addressing the substantive issue before us, we find it necessary to comment on the trial court\u2019s failure to make any findings in this case or place on the record any reasons whatsoever supporting the grant of summary judgment in favor of FMC. The obligation to do so is clear. <em>Rule </em>4:46-2(c) directs that, in deciding a summary judgment, \u201c[t]he court shall find the facts and state its conclusions in accordance with <em>R. </em>1:7-4.\u201d A trial court \u201cis obliged to set forth factual findings and correlate them to legal conclusions. Those findings and conclusions must then be measured against the standards set forth in <em>Brill v. Guardian Life Insurance Co. of America, </em>142 <em>N.J. </em>520, 540, 666 A.2d 146 (1995).\u201d <em>Great Atlantic &amp; Pacific Tea Co., Inc. v. Checchio, </em>335 <em>N.J.Super. </em>495, 498, 762 A.2d 1057 (App.Div.2000). As we stated in <em>Great Atlantic &amp; Pacific Tea Co., supra, </em>\u201cneither the parties nor we are well-served by an opinion devoid of analysis or citation to even a single case.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b230-7\">Article 2 of the Uniform Commercial Code (U.C.C.) applies to \u201ctransactions in goods.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>12A:2-102. Article 2\u2019s statute of limitations, \u00a7 2-725(1), provides that \u201c[a]n action for breach of any contract for [the] sale [of goods] must be commenced within four years after the cause of action has accrued.\u201d A cause of action accrues \u201cwhen the breach occurs____\u201d \u00a7 2-725(2).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>FMC apparently persuaded the trial court that its action to recover the deficiency owed under the retail installment contract was governed by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:14-1, which provides for a six-year statute of limitations in breach of contract cases. FMC\u2019s position is articulated in its appellate brief as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-6\">This is not an action based upon the sale of goods. This is an action based upon the deficiency on a retail installment contract (Defendant borrowed money from Plaintiff, a lender). It is simply not an action for the balance of the price of goods or damages for economic loss due to the sale of goods. Further, Defendant\u2019s deficiency due under the retail installment contract is unrelated to the sale of the vehicle itself. Rather, the deficiency is due to Defendant\u2019s failure to make payments on the contract.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">However, our Supreme Court in <em>Palmer, supra, </em>47 <em>N.J. </em>at 187, 219 A.2d 858, addressed the precise issue before us. In that case, defendant had purchased a vehicle and financed it by executing a \u201cBailment Lease Security Agreement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 185, 219 A.2d 858. The Court held that plaintiffs suit to recover a deficiency after breach was barred under \u00a7 2-725 because a deficiency suit is essentially an action to recover monies due for the sale of goods. <em>Id. </em>at 187, 219 A.2d 858. The Court rejected the concurring judge\u2019s view that such an action is not governed by \u00a7 2-725 because it is part of a \u201csecurity arrangement between the parties rather than an incident of the sales aspect of their agreement.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The Court responded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-8\">we think this view mistakes the true character of a deficiency suit. Such a suit is nothing but a simple <em>in personam </em>action for that part of the sales price which remains unpaid after the seller has exhausted his rights under Article 9 [of the U.C.C.] by selling the collateral; it is an action to enforce the obligation of the buyer to pay the full sale price to the seller, an obligation which is an essential element of all sales and which exists whether or not the sale is accompanied by a security arrangement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-9\">[IWdl</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b231-10\">The Court added:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-11\">a deficiency action must be considered more closely related to the sales aspect of a combination sales-seeurity agreement rather than to its security aspect and be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>controlled by the four year limitation in ... \u00a7 2-725.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-5\">[Id. at 187-88, 219 A.2d 858.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">The <em>Palmer </em>decision has been cited with approval by courts in other jurisdictions. <em>See First Nat\u2019l Bank v. Chase, </em>118 <em>N.M. </em>783, 887 P.2d 1250, 1251-53 (1994); <em>Scott v. Ford Motor Credit Co., </em>345 <em>Md. </em>251, 691 A.2d 1320, 1323-26 (1997). In our view, <em>Palmer </em>is dispositive.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-7\">Nevertheless, FMC argues that <em>Palmer </em>was overruled by the Legislature when, five years after the decision, it amended New Jersey\u2019s Retail Installment Sales Act, N.J.S.A. 17:16C-1 to -103, by enacting <em>L. </em>1971, c. 399, \u00a7 3, codified as <em>N.J.S.A. </em>17:16C-38.2 (\u00a7 38.2). That provision states in applicable part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AnW\">No retail installment contract shall require or entail the execution of any note unless such note shall have printed the words \u201cCONSUMER NOTE\u201d in 10 point bold type or larger on the face thereof. Such a note with the words \u201cCONSUMER NOTE\u201d printed thereon shall be subject to the terms and conditions of the retail installment contract and shall not be a negotiable instrument within the meaning of chapter 3 (Negotiable Instruments) N.J.S. 12A:3-101 et seq., or a security interest within the meaning of chapter 9 (Secured Transactions) N.J.S. 12A:9-101 et seq. of the Uniform Commercial Code. Any subsequent holder of a consumer note shall be subject to all claims and defenses of the retail buyer against the retail seller arising out of the transaction____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b232-8\">Citing the language in \u00a7 38.2 which states that a \u201cConsumer Note\u201d shall not be deemed a negotiable instrument under Article 3, or a security interest under Article 9 of the U.C.C., FMC argues that \u00a7 38.2 overruled the <em>Palmer </em>decision because the section \u201cspecifically took installment sales contracts out of the U.C.C. forum.\u201d We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-9\">Section 38.2 regulates \u201cConsumer Note[s]\u201d which buyers may be required to execute as part of a retail installment transaction; it does not address retail installment contracts themselves. De<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>fendant in this case did not execute a Consumer Note. Moreover, \u00a7 38.2 refers to the nonapplicability of Articles 3 and 9; it does not refer to Article 2, governing transactions in goods, where the four-year statute of limitations under \u00a7 2-725 is found. It therefore cannot be said that the Legislature, by enacting \u00a7 38.2, either explicitly or implicitly intended to overrule the <em>Palmer </em>holding that a deficiency suit on a transaction equivalent to a retail installment contract is governed by \u00a7 2-725. <em>See State v. Dalglish, </em>86 <em>N.J. </em>503, 512, 432 A.2d 74 (1981) (\u201c[i]n the absence of a clear manifestation to the contrary, we shall not impute to the Legislature an intention to change established law\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">Indeed, the legislative goal in enacting \u00a7 38.2 was to protect consumers, and nothing more. That intention is gleaned from the language of the section itself which provides that \u201c[s]uch a note with the words \u2018CONSUMER NOTE\u2019 printed thereon shall be subject to the terms and conditions of the retail installment contract____\u201d The Legislature\u2019s intention is also made clear from the legislative history. When signing <em>L. </em>1971, c. 399 (\u00a7 38.2), Governor Cahill declared that the enactment \u201cremoves the \u2018holder in due course doctrine\u2019 from retail installment sales contracts.\u201d He added:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-9\">This bill permits the consumer to assert his legitimate defense against holders of installment sales contracts and supplements earlier state legislation in this field. Under existing law, the consumer who signs a note in the course of purchasing goods or services must continue to make payments to the holder of that note even though he has a legitimate complaint against the seller for having received defective goods or goods in the amount or quality represented.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-10\">[Assembly Comm., <em>Amendments to Assembly Bill No. 623 </em>(1971).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b233-11\">We hold that the four-year statute of limitations under \u00a7 2-725 applies in this case. Accordingly, FMC\u2019s deficiency suit is statutorily barred. We therefore reverse the judgment in favor FMC\u2019s favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-12\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b230-9\"> A suit for failure to pay on a transaction for goods accrues under \u00a7 7-725 on the date the payment is due.
