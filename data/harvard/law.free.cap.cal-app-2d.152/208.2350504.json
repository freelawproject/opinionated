(Nellie G.) Jackson, the appellant herein; three nieces, Mrs. Anthony Maday, Mrs. Helen Hayes, and Mrs. David Kessler; two nephews, Messrs. Frederick and Lewis Petley, who were related by blood to her deceased husband; and two cousins, Messrs. Orph and John Cottingham, who were also related to decedent\u2019s predeceased spouse. The Bank of America was named by decedent as her local executor and the Messrs. Cottingham were named as alternative executors in the state of Indiana.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-8\">Decedent\u2019s will, dated January 8, 1951, and two codicils, dated respectively October 1, 1953, and March 15, 1954, were all entirely written, dated and signed by the testatrix and were duly admitted to probate.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-9\">On April 18, 1955, the Bank of America filed its first and final account, report, petition for distribution and construction of will, determination of heirship, for final distribution and for allowance of statutory and extraordinary fees. An answer to this petition was filed by Nell Maday, Helen Hayes and Frederick J. Petley and on May 5, 1955, there was filed on behalf of appellant a \u201cStatement of Claim of Interest in Estate\u201d wherein it was set forth that appellant was the sister and sole heir at law of the decedent, and claim was made to the whole of said estate, with certain exceptions. On May 25, 1955, appellant filed her \u201cPetition for Probate of Earlier Will,\u201d an holographic will in the form of a letter dated August 10, 1929. On June 10, 1955, Nell Maday, Helen Hayes and Frederick Petley filed objections to the probate of this will offered by appellant. These matters were heard in November, 1955, and on November 30th the probate judge filed an \u201cOpinion of the Court\u201d and on January 16, 1956, filed an \u201cOrder Interpreting and Construing Will and Codicils and Determining Heirship and Decree of Distribution and Ruling on Petition of Nellie G. Jackson for Probate of Earlier Will.\u201d Appellant filed a notice of intention to move for a new trial and on February 8, 1956, the probate judge filed an order vacating his order of January 16, 1956. A supplemental opinion was filed by the judge on February 8, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>1956, and on February 10, 1956, the judge filed his \u201cOrder and Decree Interpreting and Construing Will and Codicils and Determining Parties Entitled to Distribution and Disposing of Petition for Probate of Earlier Will.\u201d Nellie Jackson appeals from this order, claiming that the interpretations, constructions and directions of the probate judge are erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">Appellant first argues that paragraphs two to seven, inclusive, of the will do not constitute bequests because the testatrix failed to use therein words of donation indicating a wish, design or intent to make a bequest or gift. This contention is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">The will of January 8, 1951, begins as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-7\">\"Coronado California</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Akk0\">\u201cJanuary 8 - 1951</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-8\">\u201cI May G.

Shumack.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b230-25\">In <em>Estate of Lefranc, </em>38 Cal.2d 289 [239 P.2d 617], it is held that a will is to be construed according to the intention of the testator; that the words of a will are to receive an interpretation which will give to every expression some effect, rather than one which will render any of the expressions inoperative; and of two modes of interpreting the will, that is to be preferred which will prevent a total intestacy; that all parts of a will are to he construed in relation to each other, and so as, if possible, to form one consistent whole; that the making of a will raises a presumption that the testator in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>tended to dispose of all his property and that the prevailing principle is that the function of the court is to construe a will, not to make one; to ascertain the testator\u2019s intention as expressed and, if lawful, give it effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">In <em>Estate of Herreshoff, </em>144 Cal.App.2d 597, 599-600 [301 P.2d 457], it is said: \u201cThe objective in the interpretation of a will is to ascertain the intention of the testator as disclosed by the language he has used in his will. <em>(Estate of Brunet, </em>34 Cal.2d 105,107 [207 P.2d 567, 11 A.L.R.2d 1382].) It is well settled that it is not what a testator wanted to do but what he actually did, as expressed in the words used, which governs in the absence of other evidence with respect to his intention. <em>(Gardner </em>v. <em>Snow, </em>119 Cal.App.2d 546, 549 [259 P.2d 95].) A court may not, under the guise of construction, make a will for a testator to take the place of the one made by him if its intent is plain. <em>(Estate of Beldon, </em>11 Cal.2d 108, 112 [77 P.2d 1052]; <em>Estate of Soulie, </em>72 Cal.App.2d 332, 335 [164 P.2d 565].)\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">In <em>Estate of Brunet, </em>34 Cal.2d 105, 107 [207 P.2d 567, 11 A.L.R.2d 1382], it is held: \u201cThe objective in the interpretation of a will is to ascertain the intention of the testator as disclosed by the language he has used. <em>(Estate of Young, </em>123 Cal. 337, 345 [55 P. 1011]; <em>Estate of Henderson, </em>161 Cal. 353, 357 [119 P. 496]; <em>Estate of Ottoveggio, </em>64 Cal.App.2d 388, 391 [148 P.2d 878].)\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b231-8\">In <em>Estate of Williams, </em>113 Cal.App.2d 895, 897 [249 P.2d 348], it is held: \u201cThe cardinal rule is that the will should be construed in accordance with the intention of the testator. This intention is to be sought for by looking to the entire will, by examining the language in question, and by determining what was meant by the words actually used. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b231-9\">The doctrine of gifts by implication is also applicable in the instant case. As is said in <em>Brock </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>33 Cal.2d 885, 887, 888, 889 [206 P.2d 360, 11 A.L.R.2d 672]: \u201cThe implication of gifts in wills rests upon the primary rule of construction that the duty of the court in all cases of interpretation is to ascertain the intention of the maker from the instrument read as a whole and to give effect thereto if possible, and it is well settled that, where the intention to make a gift clearly appears in a will, although perhaps imperfectly expressed, the court will raise a gift by implication. [Citations.]\u201d . . .</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-10\">\u201cWhen the intention to make a gift clearly appears from the instrument taken by its four corners and read as a whole, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>considering its general scheme, the property involved, and the persons named as beneficiaries, the gift may be implied. <em>(Estate of Franck, </em>190 Cal. 28, 31 [210 P. 417].) Although the court may not indulge in conjecture or speculation simply because the instrument seems to have omitted something which it is reasonable to suppose should have been provided, a gift will be raised by necessary implication where a reading of the entire instrument produces a conviction that a gift was intended. [Citations.] \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">In the instant case the testatrix, at the beginning of her will, declared it to be her last will and testament, clearly indicating her intent to dispose of her property and referring to the entire document. The paragraphs of the will which follow are numbered consecutively, a further indication that its several provisions are each intended as a part of the will and are to have some meaning. The declaration following paragraphs eleven to seventeen of the will \u201cIf any of the above has died since this is made, what is left of the United States bonds divide among the last seven on this page\u201d refers to the entire will and also refers to a partial lapse of a preceding disposition of the bonds and the only earlier disposition of the United States bonds elicited from the will is one that would follow construing paragraphs eleven to seventeen, both inclusive, as though each had contained apt language bequeathing to the persons therein named the amount in United States bonds in that paragraph set against his or her name and address. That this is the true construction of paragraphs eleven to seventeen is supported by the expression in paragraph eleven, otherwise meaningless, \u201cfor being kind to me.\u201d This view is further supported by the language used in the two codicils, in the first of which it appears that the testatrix intended to cut down from $500 to $300 the amount in United States bonds mentioned in paragraph eleven of the will. The first codicil changed the bequest to Mrs. Levinsohn from a $300 bond bequeathed to her under paragraph seventeen of the original will to $300 in cash. In the second codicil the testatrix canceled what she had given to Mrs. William Gresham in paragraph sixteen of the original will, indicating that the testatrix had made a valid bequest in said paragraph sixteen. The second codicil directs the cancellation of \u201cWhat I gave to Mr. Wm. Griest of San Diego\u201d and evidently refers to what was given to Griest by paragraph eleven of the original will. The codicils, when read together and considered as a whole, justify the construction and con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>elusion of the probate judge that valid bequests were effected by the provisions of paragraphs two to seven and eleven to seventeen, inclusive, of the will.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">Appellant argues that the word \u201cstock,\u201d as used in paragraph two of the will, does not include \u201ccash.\u201d The first and final account and inventory shows a balance in decedent\u2019s name in savings share account No. 3866 in the Muncie Federal Savings and Loan Association of Muncie, Indiana, in the sum of $4,990. There was evidence that the association has no \u201cstock,\u201d but that these share accounts are commonly referred to by the public as \u201cstock\u201d; that this asset was not \u201ccash\u201d but rather a savings share account; that this asset was evidenced by a membership certificate in the association and the secretary of the association characterized the interest of the testatrix as \u201cstock.\u201d It appears sufficiently clear that in these circumstances that what the decedent meant by referring to this \u201cAssc stock\u201d was the share account and that, therefore, the legacy was valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-7\">The inventory further shows that at the time of her death the testatrix had a balance in savings share account Number 519 in the First Federal Savings and Loan Association of San Diego, California, the association named in paragraph third of the will, in the amount of $2,400; that at the time of her death she had a balance in savings share account Number 118856 in the Railroadmen\u2019s Federal Savings and Loan Association of Indianapolis, Indiana, the association named in paragraph fourth of the will, in the amount of $2,597.44 ; that she had a balance in savings account Number 7550 in the Arsenal Building and Loan Association of Indianapolis, Indiana, mentioned in paragraph fifth of the will, in the amount of $1,988.97; that she had a balance in investment share account Number 0323 in the San Diego Federal Savings and Loan Association, named in paragraph sixth of the will in the amount of $2,000; that she had a balance in savings share account Number 22679 with the Western Savings and Loan Company of Salt Lake City, Utah, the first of the two institutions named in paragraph seventh of the will, in the amount of $1,073.65 and a \u201cContingent Participation Units Certificate No. 1417\u201d therein appraised at $102.55. The inventory, however, shows no share account nor other investment held by the decedent in the \u201cMarion Federal Building and Loan Company,\u201d referred to in said paragraph seventh after the name \u201cMiss Lily Jackson.\u201d There is no evidence that at the time of her death she had any other interests or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>investments with <em>any of </em>the corporations, associations or institutions referred to in paragraphs second to seventh, both inclusive, of the will.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">The probate judge properly held that what the decedent intended to bequeath in each of said paragraphs third to seventh, both inclusive, of her will was all her investment in or with the corporation, association or institution in such paragraph mentioned, which, in each instance except in the case of the \u201cMarion Federal Building and Loan Company,\u201d turns out to be the inventoried balance at the time of her death standing to her credit in her share account or other account with the corporation, association or institution named in the particular numbered section of the will. This construction of paragraphs two to seven, inclusive, of the will does not make a will for the decedent but is an ascertainment of the intention of the testatrix as expressed by the language used in the entire will.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">Appellant argues that the portion of the will relating to death of beneficiary and division of what is left of United States savings bonds is inoperative and so ambiguous, uncertain and unintelligible that it is inapplicable and that the interpretation of the probate judge is erroneous. We are not in accord with this argument. Following paragraph seventeen of the will the testatrix wrote \u201cIf any of the above has died since this is made it what is left of the U. S. Bonds seven divide among the last eight on this page.\u201d The words \u201cthe above\u201d obviously refer to the seven persons named in the preceding paragraphs eleven to seventeen, both inclusive. It appears that the testatrix intended to provide for the disposition of the bonds bequeathed to these seven persons in the event that any one of them died and that such residue of bonds should be divided among the last seven named on that page of the will, to wit, the five nieces and nephews of the decedent and Messrs. Orph and John Cottingham. Actually there were eight named, including the executor Bank of America. It is evident that the testatrix first referred to the last eight named on said page and later crossed out the word \u201ceight\u201d and wrote the word \u201cseven\u201d with the intent of including only the last seven natural persons named on such page and excluding the Bank of America.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-8\">Appellant contends that the probate judge improperly interpreted and construed the following portion of the will \u201cMy checking accounts in both of the banks if there is any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>left or out of the War bonds after the Inheritance tax and other expenses divide it among the seven.\u201d These words are on the last page of the will between the bequests of the savings accounts, the Bank of America and the First National Bank, and the bequest of shares of San Diego Gas Company to Mrs. David Kessler. The construction and interpretation placed on the quoted portion of the will by the probate judge is that the testatrix intended thereby that should any balance remain in her checking accounts or any balance remain of her United States savings bonds, after the specific bequests from the same contained in her will, and after the payment from the applicable assets of her estate of her debts, funeral expenses, expenses of administration and such inheritance and estate taxes as might have to be deducted from such checking accounts and remaining bonds, the remaining balance of such cheeking accounts and United States savings bonds would belong in equal shares to \u201cthe seven,\u201d to said five nieces and nephews and Orph and John Cottingham. This construction appears reasonable and logical and in accordance with the intent of the testatrix.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">Finally, it is argued that the interpretation of that portion of the will and the direction of the probate judge relating to the \u201cinheritance tax and other expenses\u201d is improper and erroneous. The order and decree in this connection provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-7\">\u201c(22) For payment of the debts of the decedent and the expenses of her last illness and funeral expenses, and expenses. of administration of her estate, resort shall first be had to any residuum of her estate, such, e.g., as her inventoried stock in the Southern California Edison Company not specifically bequeathed to anyone. Any deficiency shall first be charged to the balance of funds described in the inventory as in her checking (but not her savings) account in the Bank of America National Trust and Savings Association (Coronado Branch) and to any residue, or the proceeds of any residue, of United States Savings Bonds referred to in the last paragraph of the original will, preceding the paragraph nominating the executors; and the disposition of such cheeking account and residuary bonds, or the proceeds thereof, made in such paragraph shall ratably abate to that extent. If a deficiency still remain, it shall be charged proportionately against all other monetary bequests, inclusive of bequests of the decedent\u2019s savings accounts and share accounts (made in the will or codicils) and the assets represented by any such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>bequests not reduced heretofore to cash, shall be reduced to cash to the extent necessary to satisfy such charges. All state inheritance taxes shall be charged against the respective bequests legally chargeable therewith and not paid out of the residuary assets of the estate.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">This order clearly provides that all state inheritance taxes shall be chargeable against the respective bequests legally chargeable therewith and not out of the residuary assets of the estate and each bequest is made subject to the payment of inheritance taxes, if any.  As is said in <em>Cohn </em>v. <em>Cohn, </em>20 Cal.2d 65, 67 [123 P.2d 833]:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-6\">\u201cGenerally speaking, the state assesses the privilege of succeeding to property, and computes the tax upon the interests of the legatees or devisees and the degree of relationship, if any, to the decedent. [Citations.] The tax is not one of the expenses of administration or a charge upon the general estate of the decedent; it is collectible out of each specific share or interest to which the beneficiary succeeds, and not from the general property of the estate. [Citations.] \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AiM\">The interpretation placed on the provisions of the will relating to the payment of the inheritance tax appears to us to be proper and in accord with the intention of the testatrix.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-7\">In its order and decree from which this appeal is taken the probate judge declined to admit to probate the \u201cearlier will\u201d offered by appellant on the ground that it appeared improbable that there would be any residuum of said estate which could be subject to the operation of the document. Jurisdiction of the court was reserved to admit said earlier will if it should appear that there is a residuum to be disposed of and final distribution was deferred.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-8\">We find no reversible error in the order and decree from which this appeal was taken.
