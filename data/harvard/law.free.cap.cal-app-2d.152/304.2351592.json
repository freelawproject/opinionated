Assuming it was premature, such fact would not make the appeal void. (See Rules on Appeal, 2 (c); 3 Cal.Jur.2d 654; 3 Witkin, California Procedure, 2301-2302.)</p>\n<p id=\"b323-9\">Question Presented</p>\n<p id=\"b323-10\">Did the insurance policy insure plaintiffs against the liability imposed upon them by section 352, Vehicle Code, for negligence of their minor son in operating a third person\u2019s automobile with their and the latter\u2019s permission?</p>\n<p id=\"b323-11\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b323-12\">Plaintiffs\u2019 action was for declaratory relief and damages for breach of insurance and indemnity contract, mainly to obtain a determination of defendant\u2019s liability in the action here<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>after mentioned brought by one Selna against plaintiffs and to recover attorney\u2019s fees, expenses and costs incurred and to be incurred by plaintiffs in the defense of that action, and in the prosecution of this. The court found that the insurance policy in question did not insure plaintiffs for liability under the circumstances of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-3\">Plaintiffs obtained defendant\u2019s extended coverage automobile insurance policy in standard form. Approximately six months thereafter plaintiffs\u2019 minor son (16 years old) obtained an operator\u2019s license, the application therefor having been signed by plaintiffs as required by section 350, Vehicle Code. Shortly thereafter and while the policy was still in force said minor was driving a <em>Chevrolet </em>automobile belonging to one Ralph E. Smith, with the latter\u2019s permission and that of plaintiffs, and was involved in an automobile-pedestrian accident with Lawrence Selna, a minor. Selna brought suit against plaintiffs, their minor son, Smith and others, for damages for injuries received by him in that accident. While there may have been other grounds alleged in the Selna complaint upon which recovery was sought against plaintiffs, the only ground called to the attention of the court below was the allegation that plaintiffs \u2019 liability to Selna was based upon the fact that plaintiffs signed the son\u2019s driver\u2019s license application.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> As stated by the court and agreed to by the parties, \u201cthe simple question involved\u201d was \u201cthis boy drove another car other than the car described in the policy, and the question is whether the policy is broad enough to cover the assumed liability that parents take when they sign the application for a driver\u2019s license.\u201d For that reason<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and the fact that the determination of this question makes it unnecessary, we are not discussing the other points raised by the parties on this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-4\">Plaintiffs, claiming that the insurance policy covered them as against any liability in the Selna action, demanded that defendant defend them in that action. Defendant refused, claiming that the policy did not so cover plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">Effect- of the Policfy</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">The policy names plaintiffs as the insureds. It describes the insured automobile as \u201c1947 De Soto (1B) Suburban 4 Door Sedan\u201d and gives the motor number. The policy</p>\n<p id=\"b325-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>explains that the symbol \u201c1B\u201d means \u201cthe automobile is customarily used in the course of driving to or from work and the distance driven is less than 10 road miles one-way, and there is no operator of the automobile under 25 years of age resident in the named insured\u2019s household or employed as a chauffeur of the automobile, and use of the automobile is not required by or customarily involved in the occupational duties of any person.\u201d The coverage for both bodily injury and property damage liability is \u201cTo pay on behalf of the Insured all sums which the Insured shall become legally obligated to pay as damages . . . arising out of the ownership, maintenance or use of the automobile.\u201d \u201c. . . \u2018Insured\u2019 includes the name Insured and also includes any person while using the automobile and any person or organization legally responsible for the use thereof, provided the actual use of the automobile is by the named Insured or with his permission.\u201d \u201cExcept where stated to the contrary, the word \u2018automobile\u2019 means: (1) Described Automobile-\u2014the motor vehicle or trailer described in this policy; (2) Utility Trailer . . .; (3) Temporary Substitute Automobile\u2014 ... (4) Newly Acquired Automobile\u2014 ...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b325-4\">It is obvious that none of the above mentioned provisions cover a situation where the insureds\u2019 son is driving a third person\u2019s automobile. Plaintiffs contend, however, that provision V, \u201cUse of Other Automobiles\u201d coverage does. This provides: \u201cIf the named Insured is an individual who owns the automobile classified as \u2018pleasure and business\u2019 or husband and wife either or both of whom own said automobile, such insurance as is afforded by this policy for bodily injury liability and for property damage liability with respect to said automobile applies with respect to any other automobile, subject to the following provisions: (a) With respect to the insurance for bodily injury liability and for property damage liability the unqualified word \u2018Insured\u2019 includes (1) such named Insured, (2) the spouse of such individual if a resident of the same household and (3) any other person or organization legally responsible for the use by such named Insured or spouse of an automobile not owned or hired by such other person or organization. Insuring Agreement III, Definition of Insured, does not apply to this insurance.\u201d Section (b) provides that the insuring agreement does not apply to certain automobiles, such as hired automobiles, automobiles used in the business of the named insured, and not operated by such named insured, spouse, chauffeur or servant.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>A study of paragraph V forces the conclusion that the coverage thereby provided is for bodily injury and property damage liability of the named insured in connection with automobiles other than the named automobile regardless of whether such automobile is used by the named insured. There is nothing in the policy to limit the coverage to the insured\u2019s use of other automobiles. It covers the named insured\u2019s liability arising from the use of other automobiles no matter who causes that liability, the named insured or some other person. Paragraph I of the policy extends coverage to the named insured for liability arising from the \u201cownership, maintenance or use of the automobile\u201d (the De Soto). Paragraph Y extends to the \u201cnamed Insured\u201d with respect to \u201cany other automobile\u201d \u201csuch insurance as is afforded by this policy\u201d to \u201csaid automobile\u201d (the De Soto). Thereby <em>cmy </em>liability for bodily injury or property damage from the ownership, maintenance or use of the other automobile is covered. As the coverage for liability from the use of the De Soto is not dependent upon personal use by the named insured, so coverage for liability from the use of other automobiles is not dependent upon personal use of such other automobile by the named insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-3\">Defendant would read paragraph Y as if it said that the insurance afforded by the policy with respect to the named insured\u2019s liability when other automobiles are involved arises only upon use of such other automobile by the named insured. We find no such restriction. Paragraph Y is broad as to coverage; it is restrictive only as to the persons whose liability is covered. Thus paragraph III of the policy defines as \u201cInsured\u201d persons additional to those who are covered under paragraph Y, section (a), subdivisions 1, 2 and 3. Paragraph Y extends to the three classes of persons, two of which are the named insured and his spouse, the same coverage from the use of other automobiles as is provided for the use of the De Soto, and as the coverage as to the latter is not dependent upon its personal use by the insured and the spouse, so is the coverage as to other automobiles not so dependent.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\">If there is any ambiguity in the clauses of the policy hereinbefore discussed (and we believe there is not) such ambiguity must be resolved in favor of the insured. <em>(Island </em>v. <em>Fireman\u2019s Fund Indem. Co., </em>30 Cal.2d 541 [184 P.2d 153, 173 A.L.R. 896]; <em>Wildman </em>v. <em>Government Emp. Ins. Co., </em>48 Cal.2d 31, 35 [307 P.2d 359].)</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">Defendant cites 5A American Jurisprudence, pages 86-87, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>section 88, which refers to policies containing \u201cuse of other automobile\u201d clauses as supporting defendant\u2019s position. It does not do so. It, however, states: \u201cThe construction of such clause is governed by the rules of construction employed generally in the interpretation and application of contracts of insurance.\u201d It is these rules that we have applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-4\">Plaintiffs employed attorneys to represent them in the Selna action and were successful in defeating the Selna claim. As plaintiffs were covered by said policy it was the duty of defendant to defend them in said action. (Said policy contained the usual requirement of defending the insured even though the suit against the insured should prove groundless.) Therefore plaintiffs are entitled to recover the costs and reasonable attorney\u2019s fees in defending said action. (See Civ. Code, \u00a7 2778, and <em>Arenson </em>v. <em>National Auto. &amp; Cas. Ins. Co., </em>48 Cal.2d 528 [310 P.2d 961], for right to attorney\u2019s fees for services rendered in the personal injury action where insurer\u2019s refusal to defend is unwarranted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">However, plaintiffs are not entitled to attorney\u2019s fees in the bringing of this action. There is neither statutory authority nor any provision in the policy which would justify allowing such fees. (See <em>Bank of America </em>v. <em>West End Chemical Co., </em>37 Cal.App.2d 685, 696 [100 P.2d 318].)</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">The policy states that the reference \u201cIB\u201d in the description of the named automobile means among other things that there is no operator of the automobile under 25 years of age resident in the named insured\u2019s household. At the time of the issuance of the policy plaintiffs had no such person in their household. The fact that their son thereafter became of an age to permit him to operate an automobile would and did in nowise affect the terms of the policy. This was a mere recital and none of the terms of the policy were contingent upon the statement continuing to be true.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-7\">The purported appeal from the order denying the new trial is dismissed. The judgment and the order denying the motion to vacate judgment are reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-8\">Peters, P. J., and Wood (Fred B.), J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-9\">Respondent\u2019s petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied September 4, 1957.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b323-13\">An order denying motion for new trial is not appealable <em>(Hamasaki </em>v. <em>Flotho, </em>39 Cal.2d 602, 608 [248 P.2d 910]) and hence must be dismissed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b323-14\">It was noticed for hearing for April 2, 1956.
