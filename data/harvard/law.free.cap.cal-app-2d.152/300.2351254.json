The quoted expression derives from Probate Code, section 370, which declares that any \u201cperson interested\u201d may contest a will. Such a person \u201cis one who has an interest of a pecuniary nature which may be impaired or defeated by the probate of the will or benefited by setting it aside,\u201d such as an heir or a legatee under a prior will. <em>(Estate of Harootenian, </em>38 Cal.2d 242, 248 [238 P.2d 992]. See also <em>Estate of Plaut, </em>27 Cal.2d 424, 425-426 [164 P.2d 765, 162 A.L.R. 837], and <em>San Diego Trust &amp; Sav. Bank </em>v. <em>Heustis, </em>121 Cal.App. 675, 681 [10 P.2d 158].)</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">This issue may be tried by the court prior to the trial of the validity of the will which is offered for probate and the court may dismiss the contest if an insufficient showing is made that the contestant is an interested person. <em>(Estate of Land, </em>166 Cal. 538 [137 P. 246]; <em>Estate of Sherwood, </em>123 Cal.App.2d 209 [266 P.2d 580].) In this case as in the Sherwood case the contestant interposed no objection to the determination of this issue in this manner.  At the hearing of the motion to dismiss the contest and the motion for summary judgment, contestant agreed to and did submit the motions upon the affidavits and the memoranda of points and authorities on file. In such a ease the function of a reviewing court is to determine whether there is in the affidavits evidence sufficient to support the trial court\u2019s finding that contestant is not a person interested. The same rule obtains as when the trial court\u2019s findings are based upon oral testimony. <em>(Union Supply Co. </em>v. <em>Morris, </em>220 Cal. 331, 338 [30 P.2d 394]; <em>Goes </em>v. <em>Perry, </em>18 Cal.2d 373, 378 [115 P.2d 441]; <em>Mann </em>v. <em>Pacific Greyhound Lines, </em>92 Cal.App.2d 439, 444-445 [207 P.2d 105]; 2 Cal.Jur. 931-932, Appeal and Error, \u00a7 547.)</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">The evidence supports an implied finding that contestant is not an heir of the decedent. Alfred Rodda, in his affidavit, states that he is a brother of the decedent and that contestant is a \u201cstranger in blood to\u201d the decedent and \u201cis not related to\u201d decedent \u201cby blood, marriage, consanguinity, or otherwise.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b320-7\">The only other basis for an interest in the estate was a will allegedly executed in 1946 under which contestant claimed as a legatee. There is evidence sufficient to support an implied finding that the 1946 will was no longer in existence at the time of decedent\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-8\">The attorney who drafted that will stated in his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>affidavit that he prepared it for the decedent in August, 1946, that on the 19th of that month decedent executed it and affiant delivered it to her, keeping only an unsigned carbon copy, that she took the original from his office, he has not seen it since and has no knowledge or information concerning the existence or the whereabouts of that document. The special coadministrators testified in their affidavits that they opened the decedent\u2019s safety deposit box in the presence of a representative of the state controller\u2019s office and other persons and that the 1946 document was not in the box. The coadministrators also said they made a thorough search of the house and of the effects of decedent and did not find the 1946 document. Two inferences arise from these facts: \u201c (1) that the will was destroyed by the testator [testatrix], and (2) that the act of destruction was done <em>animo revocandi. (Estate of Johnston, </em>188 Cal. 336, 339, 340 [206 P. 628]; <em>Estate of Moramarco, </em>86 Cal.App.2d 326, 334 [194 P.2d 740]; 26 Cal.Jur. 807, \u00a7 141.)\u201d <em>(Estate of Arbuckle, </em>98 Cal.App.2d 562, 566 [220 P.2d 950, 23 A.L.R.2d 372]. See also <em>Estate of Ronayne, </em>103 Cal.App.2d 852, 856 [230 P.2d 423].)</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">In view of this conclusion it is unnecessary to consider other questions discussed by the parties. The appeal from the order admitting the 1954 will to probate falls with the appeal from the judgment of dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-7\">The judgment and the order appealed from are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-8\">Peters, P. J., and Bray, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-9\">A petition for a rehearing was denied August 7, 1957, and appellant\u2019s petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied September 4, 1957.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b319-13\">This judgment was rendered upon granting (1) a motion to dismiss the contest for contestant\u2019s lack of interest in the estate and (2) a motion for summary judgment upon the ground that the contest is without merit.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
