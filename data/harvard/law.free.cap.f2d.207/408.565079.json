The defendant relies upon regulations of the bus company requiring the separate seating of white and Negro passengers. It appears that plaintiff was originally seated in accordance with the regulations and refused to change his seat when seats to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>the rear, originally occupied by Negroes, had become vacant. We think that the judgment appealed from should be affirmed because the regulations relied on were applied by the bus driver in an unreasonable manner in requiring the passenger to change his seat in an interstate journey after he had been properly seated in accordance with the regulations.
