United States, 284 U.S. 390, 52 S.Ct. 189, 76 L.Ed. 356; Ross v. United States, 6 Cir., 197 F.2d 660, certiorari denied 344 U.S. 832, 73 S.Ct. 40;</p>\n<p id=\"b829-16\">And it appearing that there was no reversible error in the admission of any portion of the testimony of the special agent of the Bureau of Internal Revenue, Francis J. Clager; and that, when reces3 was called after several hours of deliberation on the part of the jury and the judge stated to the jury that he hoped the jurors \u201cwould make a sincere effort to compromise and adjust their differences and reach a verdict, if possible\u201d, there was no exception taken by the appellant to the admonition of the judge to the jury;</p>\n<p id=\"b829-19\">And it appearing further that the court delivered to the jury a clear and correct charge, in which the rights of appellant were fully protected with extreme care, and no exception being taken to the charge;</p>\n<p id=\"b829-20\">And it appearing that no reversible error in any particular inheres in the entire trial procedure;</p>\n<p id=\"b829-21\">The judgment of the district court, fining the defendant $10,000 and imposing 18 months\u2019 imprisonment on each of counts 2, 3 and 4, to run concurrently, is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
