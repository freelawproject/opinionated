MILLER, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b89-27\">Morris Mendelsohn sued under \u00a7 503 of the Nationality Act of 1940 <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to be de-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>dared a national of the United States. His complaint was dismissed by the District Court as failing to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. The \u25a0question presented by this appeal is, of \u25a0course, whether the complaint stated a cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-4\">Its allegations may be quickly summarized. Mendelsohn was born in Poland in 1914. At the age of six years he entered the United States in the care of his father and became a citizen through the father\u2019s naturalization in June, 1923. He remained here until 1936, when he went to Palestine where he has since resided.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">When Italy entered the second World War in 1940, the American Consul General in Jerusalem requested all American citizens to leave Palestine on or before October 1, 1941. Appellant desired to leave for America before that time but was financially unable to buy passage for his alien wife, his daughter and himself. He tried unsuccessfully to borrow passage money from funds appropriated by Congress for such purposes.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Because of the war, ocean transportation obviously became increasingly difficult, if not impossible, to obtain;' anyway, appellant continued for several years to be without money to pay for passage, had it been available.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">Throughout 1946, when for the first time he had sufficient funds and transportation was available, Mendelsohn was prevented from making the trip to America \u201cby the severe illness of his wife, which confined her to her bed under the constant supervision of her physician during 1946.\u201d The State Department notified Mendelsohn he had lost his nationality as of October 14, 1946. His passport was cancelled. Such are the facts alleged as the basis of this suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-11\">The pertinent statute is \u00a7 404 of the Nationality Act of 1940, 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 804, which in part reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-12\">\u201cA person who has become a national by naturalization shall lose his nationality by:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-13\">ip # # # 4\u00cd* #</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-14\">\u201c(c) Residing continuously for five years in any other foreign state,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> except as provided in section 406 hereof * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b90-15\">It should be noted that by an act of <em>1945,</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Congress declared probably in recognition of the difficulty of civilian travel in time of war, that nationality should not be lost under \u00a7 404(c) of the 1940 Act prior to October 14, 1946.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-16\">In support of the order appealed from, the Secretary of State reasons thus: (a) Mendelsohn resided in Palestine continuously for more than five years and until after October 14, 1946, without returning to this country; (b) he does not claim to have been, and was not, within any of the exceptions to the five-year forfeiture provision which are enumerated in \u00a7 406; (c) therefore, Mendelsohn lost his nationality on October 14, 1946, under \u00a7 404(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b90-18\">The Secretary concedes, however, that \u00a7 404(c) \u201cwas aimed at a voluntary expatriation,\u201d as Chief Justice Hughes said of an earlier similar statute in Perkins v. Elg.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> There need be no ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>plicit renunciation of nationality, but the act which by statute results in loss of nationality must have been voluntarily done; if it was not, nationality is not lost because of it. That being true, the Secretary of State correctly states the question in this case to be</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-4\">\u201c * * * whether the illness of appellant\u2019s wife rendered involuntary his continued residence in Palestine after the end of the European war, when transportation was available, and when, by his own admission, he had funds with which to purchase passage.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">At the outset, appellee states, and we agree, that on October 14, 1946, there was no statute expressly permitting a naturalized husband to remain abroad, on account of the illness of his alien wife, for a period longer than that fixed by \u00a7 404(c) without loss of nationality under that section. We regard the absence of such a statutory provision as immaterial; for, since absence must have been voluntarily prolonged too far in order for the five-year-forfeiture section to become operative, the question remains as first stated by the Secretary of State: whether the severe illness of appellant\u2019s wife during 1946 rendered involuntary his failure to return here before October 14 of that year. If it did, Mendelsohn did not lose his nationality under \u00a7 404(c) by remaining with his stricken wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-7\">We quote the appellee\u2019s answer to that question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-8\">\u201c * * * Although it might have been difficult and unpleasant for appellant to leave his wife in her time of illness, he nevertheless had a choice, and the election to remain in Palestine even though it meant endangering his American citizenship was consciously made, was, in short, an act proceeding from appellant\u2019s will.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b91-10\">The Secretary thus presses upon us the adoption of a Spartan standard by which to determine whether the appellant acted voluntarily. He says Mendel-sohn could have embarked for America, turning away from the sickbed and leaving his wife to the care of others while he traveled thousands of miles to retain his nationality. It was indeed physically possible, and the appellant could have done it if he could have overcome those natural impulses which imperatively require a husband\u2019s continued presence with his wife who lies seriously ill. The Secretary\u2019s argument disregards the duress of devotion. Mendel-sohn acted, it seems to us, under the coercion of marital affection, which was just as compelling as physical restraint.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b91-11\">The appellee insists, however, that even though appellant\u2019s absence beyond the critical date be regarded as involuntary and so not within \u00a7 404(c) standing alone, Congress has elsewhere provided that nationality is lost in such circumstances unless the ailing wife is an American citizen. This is said to be the effect of \u00a7 406(c) and (e), 8 U.S. C.A. \u00a7 806(c) and (e), which are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-12\">\u201cSubsections (b) and (c) of section 404 shall have no application to a person:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-13\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-14\">\u201c(c) Who is residing abroad on account of ill health;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-15\">* *****</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-16\">\u201c(e) Who is the wife, husband, or child under twenty-one years of age of, and is residing abroad for the purpose of being with, an American citizen spouse or parent who is residing abroad for one of the objects or causes specified in section 405 or subsections (a), (b), (c), or (d) hereof; * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b91-17\">By this enactment, appellee argues, Congress said a naturalized husband whose wife becomes seriously ill while <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>they are residing in a foreign state, may remain with her beyond the cutoff date of \u00a7 404(e) without losing nationality, if she is an American citizen; thus implying that he may not do so if she is an alien. We think the argument mistakes the nature of \u00a7 404(c), and the purpose of the two subsections of \u00a7 406 just quoted, and mistakes as well the relation between those provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-4\">Section 404(c), interpreted under the Elg opinion, brands voluntary foreign residence- for five years as voluntary expatriation, but promises that \u00a7 406 will enumerate exceptions to its sweeping generality. The subsequent section does just that. It provides that \u00a7 404(c) shall not apply to a person residing abroad for any of the listed reasons, none of which implies involuntary prolongation of the foreign residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">In other words, as prolonged foreign residence which was clearly involuntary could not destroy nationality under \u00a7 404(c), Congress knew there was no need to except from the scope of that section one who was forced by circumstances to remain too long in a foreign country, and consequently limited \u00a7 406 to a list of situations in which foreign residence voluntarily undertaken should not result in loss of nationality.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">Moreover, the language of the two subsections of \u00a7 406, which we have quoted above, does not indicate applicability to a situation where a naturalized husband and his American wife were living in a foreign state for some reason other than the ill health of either, and the wife became so seriously ill that her husband was duty bound to stay with her longer than the statute permits. Section 406(c) speaks of one who is \u201cresiding abroad on account of ill health\u201d but does not require that the ill health be such as to prevent travel to the United States. It applies, therefore, when an American couple have voluntarily taken up foreign residence on account of the ill health of one of them, \u2014perhaps in search of an agreeable climate, beneficial waters, or specialized treatment not available here. It is not conditioned upon illness so disabling as to prevent travel. Appellant\u2019s case is pitched, correctly, we think, on the involuntary nature of his absence, which takes it out of the effect of \u00a7 404(c), the section which forfeits nationality for voluntary foreign residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-11\">The appellee advances another argument in support of his construction of \u00a7 406 (e) as providing that, unless a wife who becomes seriously ill while residing abroad is an American citizen, her naturalized husband cannot remain with her longer than the period permitted by \u00a7 404(c), without losing nationality. He suggests that \u00a7 353(5) (b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, approved June 27, 1952,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> eliminates what he regards as the former requirement that the sick wife be an American citizen, and thereby tends to show it had formerly been so required.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-12\">Subsection (5) of \u00a7 353 of the 1952 Act, standing alone, does afford its exception regardless of the ailing wife\u2019s nationality. But subsection (7) provides that the five-year-forfeiture section shall not apply to a national who</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-13\">\u201c(7) is the spouse or child of an American citizen, and who has his residence abroad for the purpose of being with his American citizen spouse or parent who has his residence abroad for one of the objects or causes specified in paragraph (1), (2), (3), (4), (5) or (6) of this section, or paragraph (2) of section 354 of this title; * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b93-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>Subsections (5) and (7) must, of course, be read together; when this is done, it seems plain that the latter restricts the application of the former to situations in which the ailing spouse or parent is an American citizen.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">We are not concerned with those subsections of the new Act, which have no retroactive effect. They shed no light upon the meaning of \u00a7 406(c) and (e) of the 1940 Act, which are quite different in language and purpose and which we have already construed in a manner contrary to that contended for by the appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">Mendelsohn stated a cause of action. He is entitled to his day in court and to a certificate of identity under \u00a7 503 of the Act to enable him to come here to conduct his case.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-7\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b89-16\">. 54 Stat. 1171, 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 903.
