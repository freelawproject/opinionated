This tract was situated in, and a part of Tongass National Forest when, on June 21, 1951, the appellant, defendant below, undertook to locate a mining claim thereon.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The area had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>previously been used by various road builders, operating under contracts with the Bureau of Public Roads, as a source \u2022of road building material. On February .9, 1951, and prior to defendant\u2019s attempted mineral location, the Regional Forester, at the request of the Bureau, issued a document entitled \u201cCorrection Memorandum No. 11\u201d, which recited that the area here in question \u201cis hereby reserved for the use of the Bureau of Public Roads as a source of road building material.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b378-4\">The trial court held that this was a valid \u201cspecial use permit\u201d authorized by 48 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 341 and 23 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 18, and regulations issued pursuant thereto, and that it had the effect of withdrawing the area in dispute from mineral location at the time the defendant-appellant attempted to locate it. As we agree with this holding of the district court, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b377-12\">. The location was based upon a claimed discovery of a valuable mineral deposit consisting of sand and gravel. Whether such a deposit was open to location under the general mining laws, 30 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 21 et seq., was not in question here. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>For a reference to a later decision on that question by the same district judge, Anchorage Sand &amp; Gravel Co. v.
