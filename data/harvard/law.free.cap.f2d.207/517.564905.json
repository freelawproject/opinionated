Particularized, its defenses Nos. One and Three, were that it has been and is engaged in buying and selling dressed poultry and as incident to such business it has leased trucks and transportation equipment with which it carries its poultry to market, and it is, therefore, operating as a private carrier by motor vehicle of its own goods within the meaning of Section 203(a) (17) of the act.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Its defense No. Two was that dressed poultry, the product it buys, sells, and carries, is an exempt agricultural commodity under Section 203(6) of the act.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"aps-dedup-0\">_ The cause proceeding to trial on the issues thus joined, the case was submitted on a stipulation, documentary evidence in the form of exhibits, and testimony in open court of six witnesses. The trial concluded, there were findings of ^act and conclusions of law sustaining the first defense, an opinion by the district judge, note 1, supra, giving his reasons for judgment for the defendant, and a judgment in accordance therewith , . .. . . ,. enymfi' e mjunc lon\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"AHcr\">_ Appealing from the judgment, the Commission is here, by brief and oral argument, insisting that the court erred <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> in sustaining the first and third defenses and dismissing the complaint, and that we should reverse the judgment and direct an injunction to issue as prayed,</p>\n<p id=\"Af2\">We cannot agree. On the contrary, a careful examination of the record and an appraisement of the evidence and its ef-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>feet convinces us: that the findings of fact of the district judge are not clearly erroneous; that indeed they find full and ample support in the record; that his conclusions of law were correctly arrived at; and that his judgment, for the reasons stated by him in his opinion, should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"AkI\">We are in agreement with the views of the district judge, that under the evidence the defendant is neither a common nor a contract carrier but a private carrier and as such it is not required to have either a certificate or a permit, and because of that agreement, have affirmed his judgment We, therefore, as the dis-tnct <em>Judge </em>did, have found it unnecessary to determine the second <em>question.bo </em>earnestly and thoroughly briefed by the parties and especially by the Secretary of Agriculture as Amicus Curiae, whether , . lx j . . dressed poultry, the product it carries, is an exempt agricultural commodity.</p>\n<p id=\"Ac4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"acv-dedup-0\">. 49 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 322(b).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"A3r\">. 49 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 (a), 309 (a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"APA\">. 49 U.S.C. 303(a) (17).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"A2A\"><em> </em>An-rroo ooon,i 4. 49 U.S.C. 303(b) (6).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"Ay3\">.
