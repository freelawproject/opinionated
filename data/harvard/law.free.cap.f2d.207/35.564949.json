He appeals from a summary judgment for the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-8\">Appellant was dismissed because in applying for appointment, on December 17, 1946, he answered \u201cyes\u201d to this question on the Civil Service Commission\u2019s Form 57: \u201cIs the word \u2018honorable\u2019 or the word \u2018satisfactory\u2019 used in your discharge or separation papers to show the type of your discharge or separation?\u201d The Board of Appeals and Review of the Civil Service Commission found that this answer was false and \u201cevidence of fraud\u201d. This amounts to a finding of fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-9\">There is no dispute about the underlying facts. On November 10, 1942, appellant did receive an \u201chonorable\u201d discharge (WDAGO Form 55) from enlisted status in the Army, but only in order to be commissioned a second lieutenant the next day. He did not return to civilian life until July 21, 1944, when he \u201creverted to inactive status\u201d subject to Army recall. He was then given a report of separation on WDAGO Form 53 which contained the printed words \u201cHonorable\u201d, \u201cDishonorable\u201d, and, \u201cOther\u201d. None of these words was checked.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-10\">In September, 1944, appellant executed on the Civil Service Commission\u2019s Form 14 a \u201cVeterans Preference Claim\u201d. In accordance with instructions on this form he submitted his Form 53 as well as his Form 55.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-11\">In January, 1945, appellant received a letter from the Adjutant General saying \u201cBy direction of the President, you are discharged effective this date from your temporary commission as 1st Lieutenant, Army of the United States.\u201d As appellant concedes, this letter effected his separation from the Army. He also concedes that this letter \u201cdid not in any way indicate the reason for my separation nor the nature of my discharge.\u201d It does not appear that he disclosed this letter, in or before, his application for employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-12\"> The record fully supports the Commission\u2019s finding that appellant\u2019s statement in his application for employment was false and fraudulent. He said his discharge or separation \u201cpapers\u201d used the word \u201chonorable\u201d or the word \u201csatisfactory\u201d to show the type of his discharge or separation. He did not limit this statement to any single paper. The statement was true only as applied to the so-called discharge of November 10, 1942, which neither returned him to civilian life nor separated him, except for one day, from the Army. The statement was false if applied to the paper of July 21, 1944, which did return appellant to civilian life although it did not separate him from the Army. The statement was false as applied to the letter of January, 1945, which did separate him from the Army. It is not for us to say whether the Commission\u2019s finding is correct; \u201cwhere action is taken in removing from office an employee * * * in accordance with the requirements of the statute relating thereto * * * a court of law has no jurisdiction to inquire into the guilt or innocence of the employee as to the charges upon which he was removed.\u201d Levine v. Farley, 70 U.S.App.D.C. 381, 386, 107 F.2d 186, 191.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-13\">Appellant\u2019s appointment was not permanent or indefinite, but \u201csubject to investigation\u201d. Accordingly his dismissal was not subject to the restrictions of the Veterans\u2019 Preference Act, 58 Stat. 390, \u00a7 14, 5 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 863. Kirkpatrick v. Gray, 91 U.S.App.D.C. 138, 198 F.2d 533. Valid regulations of the Civil Service Commission authorized his dismissal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>for \u201cIntentional false statements or deception or fraud in examination or appointment.\u201d 5 C.F.R. 2.104(4). \u201cFalse statements\u201d may be unintentional, but \u201cfraud in examination or appointment\u201d cannot be; \u201cunintentional fraud in examination or appointment\u201d would be a contradiction in terms. Thus \u201cfraud\u201d in the present context is exactly equivalent to \u201cintentional fraud\u201d. It is therefore immaterial that the Commission did not use the redundant term, whether the regulations used it or not.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
