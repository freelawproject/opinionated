Appellant has resided in the United States continuously since June t f()r yisitg Mexico . , T n- \u2022,\u00ab\u00ab\u00ab ~ between June 15 1922, and May 15, 1949. After each such visit, appellant returned to and entered the United States. He last entered the United States on May 15, 1949.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>On August 12, 1952, a warrant for appellant\u2019s arrest was issued by appellee, H. R. Landon, a district director of Immigration and Naturalization. That warrant stated, in substance, that, from evidence submitted to appellee, it appeared that appellant was deportable under the Act of October 16, 1918, as amended,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> because, prior to May 15, 1949, he was a member of the Communist Party of the United States.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Under that warrant, appellant was arrested at Los Angeles, California, on August 13, 1952. A hearing was had at Los Angeles on August 18, 1952.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On August 20, 1952, the hearing officer (Wade H. Westmoreland) rendered a decision to the effect that appellant was deportable under the Act of October 16, 1918, as amended, because prior to May 15, 1949, he was a member of the Communist Party of the United States.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Appellant appealed from that decision, but the Board of Immigration Appeals dismissed that appeal on October 23, 1952. Accordingly, on October 29, 1952, the Attorney General, by Albert Del Guercio, an acting district director of Immigration and Naturalization, issued a warrant commanding the district enforcement officer at Los Angeles or any officer or employee of the Immigration and Naturalization Service to deport appellant to Mexico. Under that warrant, appellant has been detained in custody of an officer or officers of the Immigration and Naturalization Service at Los An-geles since October 29, 1952.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-14\">On December 1, 1952, appellant petitioned the United States District Court for the Southern District of California for a writ of habeas corpus. Thereupon, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>on December 1, 1952, the District Court issued an order requiring appellee to show cause why a writ of habeas corpus should not be granted. Appellee filed a return,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> appellant filed a traverse, and the District Court entered a judgment discharging the order and denying the petition. This appeal is <em>from </em>that judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"A8C\">Appellant contends that the Act of October 16, 1918, as amended, was unconstitutional; that the evidence received at the hearing on August 18, 1952, was \u201cinsufficient to sustain the deportation charge;\u201d that appellant \u201cwas not given a fair and impartial hearing;\u201d that the hearing on August 18, 1952, \u201cwas not legally conducted;\u201d that \u201cthe procedure required by law was not follo<em>w</em>ed; and that evidence not disclosed to appellant or his counsel was considered by the hearing officer m arriving at his decision, \u201cthus rendering the hearing unfair.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AcsR\">There is no merit in any of these contentions. The Act of October 16, 1918, as amended, was constitutional.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The return and exhibits attached thereto<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> showed that the hearing officer\u2019s decision was amply supported by evidence, including appellant\u2019s own testimony ;<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> that appellant had a fair and impartial hearing on August 18, 1952; that that hearing was legally conducted; that the procedure required by law was followed; and that the hearing officer\u2019s decision was based on evidence received in the presence of, and fully disclosed to, appellant and his counsel. Nothing to the contrary was alleged in the petition or in the traverse.</p>\n<p id=\"A5U\">The petition stated that appellant\u2019s detention was unlawful, but that was a mere statement of a legal conclusion, Neither the petition nor the traverse stated any fact or facts warranting that conclusion or entitling appellant to a writ of habeas corpus,</p>\n<p id=\"ANr\">Judgment affirmed,</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b746-4\">. 1.

Appellant testified at the hearing and, in the course of his testimony, admitted that he was a member of the Communist Party of the United States on October 29, 1940. Also received in evidence at the hearing was a statement made under oath by appellant to Austin E. Moe, an investigator and immigrant inspector of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, on June 19, 1952, and signed by appellant on August 13, 1952. In that statement, appellant admitted that he was a member of the Communist Party of the United States \u201cin 1939 up <em>to </em>1940, for two years.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b746-18\">. The hearing officer found that appellant \u201cvoluntarily became a member of the Communist Party of the United States at. Los Angeles, California, about or during 1939 and maintained 'that membership' continuously for a period of approximately two years thereafter.\u201d Thus, in effect, the hearing officer found that, on and after May 15, 1949\u2014the date of appellant\u2019s last entry into the United States\u2014 appellant was a member of one of the classes of aliens enumerated in \u00a7 1(2) of the Act of October 16, 1918, as. amended, 64 Stat. 1006, 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 137 (2), namely, an alien who had been a member of the Communist Party of the United States.
