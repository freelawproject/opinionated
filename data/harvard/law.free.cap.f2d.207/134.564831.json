MILLER and BAZELON, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b187-25\">BAZELON, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b187-26\">Appellant was charged with first degree murder<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and convicted of second degree murder.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> He concentrates his appeal on two allegations of error, namely, (1) the court\u2019s denial of his motion under Rule 17(c), Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, 18 U.S.C.A., for leave to inspect in advance of trial certain papers in possession of the Government; and (2) the court\u2019s failure properly to instruct the jury on the difference between second degree murder and manslaughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-29\">At issue under the first allegation is whether \u201cstatements made by the defendant\u201d and \u201cstatements volunteered to the Government by witnesses or third parties relating to this case\u201d are within the reach of Rule 17(c)\u2019s pre-trial inspection provision. Appellant concedes that the trial court did not err in holding these items outside the scope of Rule 16\u2019s discovery procedure.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> But he contends <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>that it was error for the court to quash the subpoena duces tecum by which they were sought under Rule 17(c). That Rule provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ASj\">\u201cA subpoena may also command the person to whom it is directed to produce the books, papers, documents or other objects designated therein. The court on motion made promptly may quash or modify the subpoena if compliance would be unreasonable or oppressive. The court may direct that books, papers, documents or objects designated in the subpoena be produced before the court at a time prior to the trial or prior to the time when they are to be offered in evidence and may upon their production permit the books, papers, documents or objects or portions thereof to be inspected by the parties and their attorneys.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AHc\">Somewhat conflicting statements regarding the scope of Rule 17(c) were made by the Supreme Court in Bowman Dairy Co. v. United States.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> On the one hand, the Court said, \u201cIt was not intended by Rule 16 to give a limited right of discovery, and then by Rule 17 to give a right of discovery in the broadest terms. * * * Rule 17(c) was not intended to provide an additional means of discovery. Its chief innovation was to expedite the trial by providing a time and place <em>before </em>trial for the inspection of the subpoenaed material.\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark>' On the other hand, the Court said, \u201cthe plain words of the Rule are not to be ignored. They must be given their ordinary meaning to carry out the purpose of establishing a more liberal policy for the production, inspection and use of materials at the trial.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> \u201cThere may be documents and other materials in the possession of the Government not subject to Rule 16. <em>No good reason appears to us why they may not be reached by subpoena under Rule 17(c) as long as they are evidentiary. </em>That is not to say that the materials thus subpoenaed must actually be used in evidence. It is only required that a good-faith effort be made to obtain evidence. * * * In short, any document or other materials, admissible as evidence, obtained by the Government by solicitation or voluntarily from third persons is subject to subpoena.\u201d <footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b188-9\">In following the Bowman view which leads to the fullest presentation of facts and away from the notion of a trial as a game of combat by surprise,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> we hold that the written statements of defendant and witnesses fall within Rule 17(c)\u2019s ambit. The crucial sentence of the Rule provides that the court \u201cmay\u201d direct production and permit inspection prior to trial of \u201cbooks, <em>papers, documents, </em>or objects designated in the subpoena.\u201d <footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The words \u201cpapers\u201d and \u201cdoc-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>nments\u201d embrace the written statements sought by appellant.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> And the defendant\u2019s statement, which was introduced in evidence, and statements by the witnesses, which might have been introduced for impeachment purposes, were clearly \u201cevi-dentiary,\u201d as Bowman requires. But the same cannot be said of statements by \u201cthird persons\u201d who are not otherwise identified. Such statements are not pri-ma facie evidentiary. And appellant made no showing in his memorandum supporting his motion for inspection under 17(c) that those statements were \u201cevidentiary.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b189-4\">Quashing the subpoena and thereby denying appellant an opportunity before trial to inspect statements by defendant and witnesses was error. If compliance would have been \u201cunreasonable or oppressive\u201d <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> or would have resulted in \u201ca fishing expedition\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> as to additional items sought but not now in issue, the trial court should have modified the subpoena to include only material within 17 (c)\u2019s reach. No sound reasons were offered by the Government, and we can think of none, for precluding pre-trial inspection of such material. No objection was or could have been made to disclosing the identity of informants through such material.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The Government had already furnished appellant with a list of witnesses whose statements were sought.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> No showing was made that appellant\u2019s request for his and witnesses\u2019 statements was \u201cunreasonable or oppressive,\u201d or in furtherance of a \u201cfishing expedition.\u201d Under these circumstances, it was error to deny pre-trial inspection of these papers.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">However, the trial court\u2019s refusal to grant pre-trial inspection of defendant\u2019s statement was not prejudicial.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> It <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>was urged that an examination of the 'statement would have aided a psychiatrist for the defense to determine appellant\u2019s mental capacity at the time the crime was committed. But the statement was introduced in evidence by the Government five days before the psychiatrist took the stand. This provided ample time for its inspection. Moreover, the psychiatrist testified that appellant was of unsound mind at the time the crime took place.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-4\">Since the written statements of witnesses are not in the record, we cannot say whether the court\u2019s failure to order their production under 17(c) was prejudicial to appellant.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> We think justice is best served by remanding this case to the District Court with instructions to order production of these statements for inspection by appellant, and to entertain a motion for a new trial if one is presented within five days thereafter. If upon hearing such motion, the court determines that appellant was prejudiced, it should grant a new trial; otherwise, its present judgment should stand.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">At issue under the second allegation of error is whether appellant was prejudiced by instructions to the jury on the difference between second degree murder and manslaughter. The trial judge accurately stated the crucial difference between these homicides. He charged:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-11\">\u201cMurder in the second degree is the unlawful killing of another, where there is not a premeditated design and plan to effect death, but where there is <em>malice </em>aforethought.\u201d <footnotemark>18</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AFM\">and</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-12\">\u201cManslaughter * * * is the unlawful killing of a human being <em>without </em>malice.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b190-14\">Contrary to appellant\u2019s contention, we find in these instructions compliance with the principles enunciated by this court in Weakley v. United States.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b190-15\">We have carefully considered other allegations of* error and find them without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-16\">Remanded with instructions to proceed in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b187-16\">. 22 D.C.Code \u00a7 2401 (1951).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b187-17\">. 22 D.C.Code \u00a7 2403 (1951).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b187-30\">. Appellant also concedes that the court did not err in refusing to permit inspec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>tion of other items sought in his subpoena duces tecum. We note these concessions without passing upon the validity of the reasons to support them.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">Rule 16 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure provides: \u201cUpon motion of a defendant at any time after the filing of the indictment or information, the court may order the attorney for the' government to permit the defendant to inspect and copy or photograph designated books, papers, documents or tangible objects, obtained from or belonging to the defendant or obtained from others by seizure or by process, upon a showing, that the items sought may be material to the preparation of his defense and that the request is reasonable. The order shall specify the time, place and manner of making the inspection and of taking the copies or photographs and may prescribe such terms and conditions as are just.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b188-10\">. 1951, 341 U.S. 214, 71 S.Ct. 675, 95 L.
