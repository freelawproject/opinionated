He attacks the indictment, the sufficiency of the evidence and the constitutionality of section 1357(a) (1) of title 8 U.S.C.A., under the authority of which immigration officers had interrogated the defendant as to his right to remain in the United States. We have considered the defendant\u2019s contention but find them so wholly lacking in merit as to require no extended discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-19\">The judgment of the district court will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
