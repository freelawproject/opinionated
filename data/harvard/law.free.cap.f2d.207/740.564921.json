This count sought a decree, vacating the final judgment in the condemnation suit in so far as it affected plaintiffs\u2019 lands, and awarding plaintiffs a judgment for $7500 as their fair market value.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-19\">The United States pleading the six year statute of limitations, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2401(a), as a complete bar to plaintiffs\u2019 suit, plaintiffs filed what they designated their fourth amendment. In and by it they sought to abandon their original action, to convert it into a motion under Rule 60(b), Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, 28 U.S.C. in Civil Action 204, the original condemnation proceeding, and to obtain relief thereby from the judgments entered therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-20\">The United States objected to amendment four and moved to disallow it and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>also filed its motion to dismiss plaintiffs\u2019 suit because neither the original complaint nor any of the amendments to it stated any ground for relief and particularly because it plainly appeared from the complaint that their suit was barred by the six year statute of limitation defendant had invoked.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-4\">The district judge, in an opinion in the form of conclusions of fact and law, held in substance: (1) that the United States by depositing in the condemnation proceedings the money found to be the value of the land condemned, had satisfied and thereby become discharged of its liability, and that it was not concerned with how the compensation should be distributed; and (2) that because plaintiffs had not been made parties to the condemnation proceedings, they had, however, a remedy, for six years after the taking, by suit under the Tucker Act for the value of their land,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> but that since this suit had not been brought within six years, the time prescribed under the Tucker Act, it could not be maintained.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-5\">On the basis of these findings, he disallowed plaintiffs\u2019 third and fourth amendments, sustained defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss and dismissed plaintiffs\u2019 action.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-6\">Plaintiffs appealing from that judgment are here insisting that the court erred in dismissing the suit not because the original Tucker claim was not barred \u2014they admit that it was \u2014 but because, under their disallowed amendments, they are not suing under that act, and the limitation statute invoked is not applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-7\">What they are doing, appellants say, is, by motion in the original condemnation suit, under Rule 60(b) and the authorities cited under it,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> seeking relief from the judgments entered therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-8\">We think it quite plain that this contention is wholly without merit and that in making it appellants overlook the controlling consideration by which this case is determined. This is that they were not parties to the condemnation suit, and it is therefore not the judgments in that suit which stand in the way of their recovery for the land taken from them if as they claim, it was taken without compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-14\">What stands in their way is the six year statute of limitations which, raising an absolute bar to their suit after six years from the taking, prevents their recovery for it.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-15\">If, therefore, the judgments, which plaintiffs seek by their motion to set aside, were to be set aside in this suit, this would avail plaintiffs nothing. For the time within which to sue the United States for its valuing having long since run, plaintiffs have no standing to sue therefor.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-16\">The judgment dismissing their action was right. It is</p>\n<p id=\"b793-17\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b793-9\">. Hurley v. Kinkaid, 285 U.S. 95, 52 S.Ct. 267, 76 L.Ed. 637; U. S. v. Meyer, 7 Cir., 113 F.2d 387; U. S. v.
