A motion for relief pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 was denied in November, 1949. DeNormand\u2019s attempt to appeal from such denial failed because no final order had been entered by the district court. The final order was entered after the application for the writ had been made below. No attempt was made to appeal from this final order. There is no showing of facts that \u00a7 2255 was inadequate and ineffective to render him relief by motion for rehearing or other relief or by appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-22\">Where relief had been denied upon such a Section 2255 motion, a district court is without jurisdiction to entertain a federal prisoner\u2019s application for a writ of habeas corpus. Jones v. Squier, 9 Cir., 195 F.2d 179.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-23\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
