That argument misses the point. The essential dispute, as we see it, is not over the method of classification or division. Classification may be made either by the \u201cvertical\u201d or by the \u201chorizontal\u201d method, for the statutory language supports both a classification according to the employer\u2019s occupation or business <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and one based upon the occupation or trade of the employees.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b66-23\">The fatal defect in Wage Order No. 7 lies in the fact that it purports to cover not only a number of listed occupations but also a category labeled \u201cmiscellaneous,\u201d which, as the Board itself recognized in its annual report for 1948, was intended to cover \u201call those who are not subject to one of the Board\u2019s other five industrial orders.\u201d That type of cate<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>gorization evades and subverts the systematic division contemplated by the statute and gives the regulation here in question its catch-all quality.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">Congress specified that wage orders be issued on an occupational basis, and \u201cmiscellaneous\u201d obviously cannot, by any stretch of the imagination, be termed an occupation.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> It is neither for the Board nor for the courts to override a policy decision made by the Congress, merely because we may consider some other method more practical, more convenient, or better suited for the attainment of the desired result.
