The court granted defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss, basing its action on the first claim upon plaintiff\u2019s laches, on the second suspension and dismissal upon res judicata,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and on the third upon lack of standing to sue. We affirm on the same grounds except as to the third claim we base affirmance on the failure of the complaint to state a cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-26\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b84-15\">.
