Appellant is imprisoned in the Lorton Reformatory under the judgment and sentence of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. He complains that orders made and commitments issued in connection with the judgment and sentence are void and asked the court below to so declare. We agree with the District Judge that he was without jurisdiction in the premises. If there was any irregularity in the sentence or orders under which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>appellant was held, and we do not intimate that there was, appellant\u2019s remedy was a motion in the sentencing court under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, not a petition for a declaratory judgment in another court. As was well said by Judge Watkins, speaking for the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia Circuit in Clark v. Memolo, 85 U.S.App.D.C. 65, 174 F.2d 978, 981, \u201cIt was the primary purpose of the [Declaratory Judgment] act, [28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 2201, 2202] to have a declaration of rights not theretofore determined, and not to determine whether rights theretofore adjudicated have been properly adjudicated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b463-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
