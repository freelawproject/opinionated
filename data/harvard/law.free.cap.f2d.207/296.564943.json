The alleged errors are predicated on the instructions to the jury on negligence and contributory negligence. Counsel for Allen submitted no requested instructions and took no exception to the instructions given, except to say, \u201cWill your honor allow an exception to the contributory negligence instructions given?\u201d to which the court answered \u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b349-17\">Rule 51 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, 28 U.S.C.A., in part, reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-18\">\u201c * * * No party may assign as error the giving or the failure to give an instruction unless he objects thereto before the jury retires to consider its verdict, stating distinctly the matter to which he objects and the grounds of his objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-19\">* * *\u00ab</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b349-20\"> It is clear that the exception taken did not meet the requirements of the Rule. The Rule was designed to prevent a litigant from taking advantage of an error which could be rectified by the court, if called to its attention by proper objection prior to final submission of the case.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b349-21\">Ordinarily, the failure to particularize the grounds of objection to an instruction so as to give the trial court an opportunity to correct it, if erroneous, precludes review on appeal.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b349-22\">While the court of appeals, of its own motion and in furtherance of justice, may review fundamental errors not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>saved by proper objection,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the record here affords no basis for applying an exception to the general rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b350-26\">.
