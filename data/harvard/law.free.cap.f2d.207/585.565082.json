See Jones v. First National Building Corporation, 10 Cir., 155 F.2d 815. There being a deficit in \u201caccumulated earnings,\u201d no dividends could be paid lawfully under Delaware law.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-18\">As was reasoned by the district judge, inasmuch as the appellee taxpayer was a deficit corporation under Delaware law at the close of the preceding taxable year, that is, on October 31, 1937, and in consequence was prohibited by Delaware law from paying dividends during the existence of such deficit and by the provisions of its corporate charter, the appellee was entitled to recovery or refund of undistributed profits tax which it had paid on account of its fiscal year ending October 31, 1938.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-19\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
