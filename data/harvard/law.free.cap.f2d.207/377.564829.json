He is charged with having failed to report all of the income from this business for the years 1946, 1947, 1948, 1949. The Government established the alleged excess income for these years by the \u201cnet worth\u201d method, measuring the increase of net worth for each year. The items which went into a net worth statement prepared by the Government were stipulated to be correct with the exceptions of \u201cCash on Hand\u201d and \u201cCash in the Bank.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b429-22\">The burden of proof is on the prosecution as to each pertinent starting item of the net worth statements to a reasonable certainty.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Absent such a starting item as, say, cash on hand the remainder of the statement proves nothing. Here there is no question as to the items \u201ccash in bank\u201d as to each of the four years. As to \u201ccash on hand,\u201d that, at the start of the accounting period, must be low enough to combine with the other factors to show a greater income than reported.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-23\">Here the Government\u2019s computation rested on $500 cash on hand at the beginning of 1946 and on that beginning amount the four years\u2019 charges of under reporting were made. At the trial a tax <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>agent, a witness for the government, testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-4\">\u201cQ. Now, let\u2019s get back to this statement. You said, as I understand it, that if the cash on hand item as it appears in your net worth statement is in error then the whole thing is in error, that is right, isn\u2019t it? A. It would affect it, yes. It wouldn\u2019t make any of the other items wrong or right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-5\">\u201cQ. Just make the total wrong all the way through? A. Yes, if the item was wrong.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-6\">\u201cQ. The total taxes, the total amounts Mr. Calderon is to be charged with would be wrong all the way through? It is true, isn\u2019t it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A8H\">A. Yes, sir.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b430-8\">Calderon contends there is no admissible evidence to show his charged understatements, since all the testimony concerning the cash on hand consisted of his extrajudicial admissions to the tax officials and to his tax consultant.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-9\">The Government claims that Calderon\u2019s sworn statement given the tax officials confessing the under-reporting of his income for the four years, which was introduced in evidence over the objection that the corpus delicti had not been shown, is not an extrajudicial admission. The contrary has been stated the law in Pon Wing Quong v. United States, 9 Cir., 111 F.2d 751; Gulotta v. United States, 8 Cir., 113 F.2d 683; Yost v. United States, 4 Cir., 157 F.2d 147.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-10\">Calderon took the stand and gave testimony of cash on hand on January 1, 1945, which conflicted with his testimony at an earlier trial. We agree with the Government\u2019s position that the jury rejected Calderon\u2019s testimony as a whole. Otherwise they would have had to acquit him on the charges for 1947 and 1948, since the lowest amount of cash on hand he stated made his returns for those years not understatements.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-11\">The only other evidence showing the charged understatements consists of Caldron\u2019s verbal statements to the tax officials and to his bookkeeper. <em>A fortiori </em>since such written statements are extrajudicial, these verbal statements are. They cannot be the basis of a conviction, absent, as here, some independent proof of the corpus delicti. Spriggs v. United; States, 9 Cir., 198 F.2d 782; United. States v. Chapman, 7 Cir., 168 F.2d 997, 1001, certiorari denied, 335 U.S. 853, 69 S.Ct. 82, 93 L.Ed. 401.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-13\">The judgment is reversed and a new trial ordered.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b429-24\">.
