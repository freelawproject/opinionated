On motion of the appellees, filed November 25, 1952, the court below on the same day ordered and adjudged that said action be, and the same was, dismissed with prejudice. In so doing, we think the district court exceeded its power. Therefore, the judgment appealed from is reversed and the cause is remanded to the district court with directions to set aside and hold for naught the judgment of dismissal with prejudice, and for such further proceedings, if any, as shall not be inconsistent herewith.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-6\">The motion to tax costs against appellees for unnecessarily encumbering the record is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-7\">Reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
