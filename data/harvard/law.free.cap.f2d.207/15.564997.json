Gariepy v. Pearson, D.C., 104 F.Supp. 681. The Company examined the script in advance and admits it \u201ccaused\u201d the words set forth in appellant\u2019s complaint to be broadcast.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-11\">Appellant is the former wife of Bernard F. Gariepy of Michigan. She divorced him in 1943. In appellees\u2019 broadcast from Washington on January 30, 1949, they said: \u201cDetroit. The Justice and Treasury Departments have ordered the prosecution of Dr. Bernard F. Garie-py of Royal Oak, Michigan, in a strange income-tax case indirectly involving Father Coughlin. Dr. Gariepy\u2019s defense is that Father Coughlin gave him $68,000 because of alienation of affection of Mrs. Gariepy by the radio priest. The Justice Department plans to prosecute Gariepy anyway.\u201d In their broadcast of February 6, 1949, appellees said: \u201cDespite denials, the income tax case of Dr. Bernard F. Gariepy, indirectly involving Father Coughlin, will be brought to trial. When that trial takes place we will see who was really telling the truth.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b68-12\">Appellant claims the broadcasts were understood to imply that she was an unchaste wife.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b68-13\">Doubtless the appellees had no desire to harm the appellant. However, the question is not whom they aimed at but whom they hit. We agree with the District Court that the words \u201calienation of affection\u201d do not usually imply unchastity. But that, again, is not the question. The law does not strip words to their minimum meaning and ignore their implications. It does not ignore their context. The words \u201cSmith got rich fast\u201d would not imply corruption, but the words \u201cSmith got rich fast while he was a tax assessor\u201d might. In the statement, \u201c * * * Father Coughlin gave him $68,000 because of alienation of affection of Mrs. Gariepy * * * \u201d, the unusual amount might be thought to imply unusual circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-14\">\u201c \u2018It is only when the court can say that the publication is not reasonably capable of any defamatory meaning, and! cannot reasonably be understood in any defamatory sense, that the court can rule, as matter of law, that the publication is not libellous.\u2019 \u201d Meyerson v. Hurlbut, 68 App.D.C. 360, 362, 98 F. 2d 232, 234, 118 A.L.R. 313. Peck v. Tribune Co., 214 U.S. 185, 29 S.Ct. 554, 53 L.Ed. 960. Therefore the question for the court in the present case was whether appellees\u2019 broadcasts might reasonably be understood as implying that appellant was an unchaste wife. In our opinion they clearly might. It followed that a jury should be permitted to decide whether they actually were so understood. \u201cIf there are listeners who reasonably understand the words in a defamatory sense, the fact that more of those who hear them will give them an innocent meaning will not prevent defamation.\u201d Prosser on Torts (1941), p. 789. If the words \u201cobviously would hurt the plaintiff in the estimation of an important and respectable part of the commu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>nity, liability is not a question of a majority vote. Peck v. Tribune Co., supra, 214 U.S. at page 190, 29 S.Ct. at page 556.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b68-15\">. Alienation of affection obviously implies some degree of marital discord. In general, assertion of marital discord is libelous, Thackrey v. Patterson, 81 U.S.App. D.C. 292, 157 F.2d 614. But because of the divorce, appellant makes no claim on that theory,</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b69-6\">WILBUR K. MILLER, Circuit Judge (dissenting).</author>\n<p id=\"b69-7\">I think the innuendo pleaded by the appellant is not borne out by the broadcast. I would affirm on the basis of the opinion of District Judge James W. Morris. Gariepy v. Pearson, D.C.1952, 104 F. Supp. 681.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
