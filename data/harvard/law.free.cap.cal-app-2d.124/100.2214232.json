Boyce testified he was working at the station when a car occupied by two people drove in about <em>2 </em>a. m.; defendant, the passenger in the ear, got out and asked Boyce to fill the tank with ethyl; the gas cap was locked and neither the driver nor the defendant could locate the key, so they drove off; about 15 minutes later defendant returned on foot; there was no car present this time; Boyce was transferring money from the cashbox to a floor safe; defendant had a gun in his hand which appeared to be a .32 caliber and demanded the money, amounting to about $105, which Boyce turned over to him; defendant told Boyce to go into a back room and stay there until defendant got away and not to notify the police, took Boyce\u2019s keys from him, and then left; the lighting at the station was very good.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-12\">This evidence is sufficient. Defendant challenges it on the basis, it would appear, that Boyce was an inaccurate observer or had a poor memory because, defendant asserts, Boyce could \u201cnot identify any amount of silver money, could not identify the amount of currency that was in the safe . . ., does not recall whether the sales that evening were mostly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>cash or charge accounts, did not know the amount of currency in the safe . . ., as to how many twenty dollar bills there were, tens, fives or ones. \u2019 \u2019 That is the type of challenge which defendant makes concerning the testimony of Boyce and that of Officer Girard, which we need not detail further.  These were matters for the consideration of the triers of the facts in weighing the evidence and evaluating the testimony, not for appraisal by the reviewing court in the absence of anything which even tends to show that the testimony was inherently unbelievable. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Farrington, </em>213 Cal. 459, 463 [2 P.2d 814]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Harsch, </em>44 Cal.App.2d 572, 575 [112 P.2d 654] ; <em>People </em>v. <em>Castro, </em>68 Cal.App.2d 491, 494-495 [157 P.2d 25].)</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">(2) <em>As to asserted errors committed during the course of the trial, </em>defendant quotes a number of excerpts from the reporter\u2019s transcript, without specifying as to any of them wherein the asserted error lies, and then says that \u201cduring the entire trial, the trial judge did not permit full objections to evidence, but ruled before an objection was made, and made expressions which are reflected in foregoing testimony, which prejudiced the defendant\u201d in the minds of the jury; and \u201cthat the court erred in its ruling upon the evidence, in that it permitted cross-examination of defendant as to facts not brought out on direct examination ...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">The portions of the transcript thus commented upon by defendant are summarized below. We do not find in them any cause for reversal.  It is the duty of the trial judge to interrogate a witness when the occasion warrants it but he may not take a witness out of the hands of his counsel and proceed along an independent and extensive line of examination and cross-examination. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Boggess, </em>194 Cal. 212, 241 [228 P. 448].) We are convinced that that principle was not here violated. The passages quoted do not represent a continuous line of examination or series of comments by the court. They are isolated instances occurring in various portions of 227 pages of testimony. In each instance there appears to have been a proper occasion for comment or interrogation by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-7\">Concerning the circumstances under which Boyce identified the defendant at police headquarters, Boyce was asked whether the inspector said anything to him regarding the defendant. An objection was made on the ground that no foundation had been laid to show that defendant was present. The court overruled the objection, saying that a \u201cyes\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>or \u201cno\u201d answer was proper. The next question asked was whether defendant was in the robbery detail at the time. The court then restated the question asking Boyce to tell what happened within the presence and hearing of the defendant. Boyce answered, saying that the man was brought in and the inspector asked if that was the man, to which he answered \u201cYes, that is the man.\u201d The fact that defendant was then present, heard Boyce\u2019s identifying statement and said nothing, neither denying Boyce\u2019s statement nor telling Boyce that he was wrong, appears from defendant\u2019s own testimony upon cross-examination. We fail to see any possible prejudice to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">Boyce, on cross-examination, testified that he did not know how much money was in the cashbox when he came on duty. Defendant\u2019s counsel asked him again if he knew how much was in the cashbox. The court interposed, saying \u201cHe says he doesn\u2019t know. I am wondering how much farther you can go when he says he doesn\u2019t know. Wouldn\u2019t it be speculative, any additional answer that he might give to you?\u201d Defendant\u2019s counsel responded, \u201cAll right.\u201d We perceive no error here.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-7\">Asked by defendant\u2019s counsel if he did not remove any funds from the cashbox to the safe before 2 o\u2019clock, Boyce responded, \u201cNo, ma\u2019am.\u201d The court interposed, \u201cdo you mean that you did not?\u201d and the witness replied \u201cI did not before 2:00 o\u2019clock, yes.\u201d That merely served to clarify the answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-8\">When Boyce was asked how many cars came into the station that night, the court said \u201cOver what period of time?\u201d Defendant\u2019s counsel responded, \u201cProm 11:00 o\u2019clock until 2:00 o\u2019clock,\u201d and proceeded with the interrogation of the witness. Again we find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-9\">Defendant\u2019s counsel asked Boyce whether defendant wore a dark or light suit when he came to the station and the court said \u201cHe has already testified to that, that it was dark blue. Isn\u2019t that right?\u201d and the witness said, \u201cYes, sir.\u201d It is not desirable for the court to interfere with the examination of a witness but on this occasion we do not see that it was prejudicial to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-10\">Defendant testified he arrived at his home at 1:30 that evening. His counsel then asked, \u201cQ. You did not go out again-A. No. Q. Is that correct? . . .-\u201d Whereupon the court commented, \u201cI don\u2019t think you expected that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>answer. \u2018You did not leave after that?\u2019 And then you said \u2018Is that correct?\u2019 And he says, \u2018No\u2019 which gives it an affirmative answer.\u201d Counsel then reframed the question and got an unmistakably clear answer. Why defendant thinks he should complain of that, is inexplicable. '</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">Defendant had testified upon cross-examination that he had t,alked about this case with his mother but not with his father except after he was out of jail. Then when asked if shortly after the day of the offense he had a conversation with his father in which the latter told him that the inspectors were asking whether defendant was home that night, his counsel objected on the ground of not proper cross-examination. Upon the overruling of the objection he said he had no such conversation with his father. This apparently was outside the scope of the direct examination. We do not see that his negative answer was prejudicial to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">A question whether defendant owned a pistol was allowed over the objection that it was not proper cross-examination. It was allowed as a preliminary question (subject to motion to strike if not connected up) in view of the fact that upon direct, defendant had answered \u201cNo\u201d to this question: \u201c. . . did you at 2:00 o\u2019clock in the morning on October 23rd, 1952, go to a Standard Oil station at Fell and Van Ness and hold up Mr. Boyce ? \u2019 \u2019 and the information charged robbery while armed with a pistol. The district attorney then restated the question, asking defendant if he owned a pistol on October 23, 1952. Defendant answered \u201cNo\u201d and was next asked if he owned a pistol during the few weeks prior to that time, which was objected to as highly prejudicial. The objection was overruled and he answered \u201cNo.\u201d The district attorney then asked defendant if he had ever told anyone that he could pawn pistols, during the period just preceding October 23d. An objection to this question was sustained by the court as to its form. The defendant was then asked if he had told anyone that he had pistols which he could pawn. He answered, \u201cNo.\u201d To the objection, the court stated that the answer was in and that the question was accepted as preliminary, subject to a motion to strike.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-7\">Defendant said he was at the Orpheum Bar, Eighth and Market, prior to 1:30 upon the evening in question. To the question, \u201cThat is how far from Van Ness and Market?\u201d his counsel objected that it called for the conclusion of the witness. The objection was properly overruled. He-answered, \u201cAround seven or eight blocks.\u201d After a few more questions, cross-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>examination ended and defendant\u2019s counsel had no further questions. The court then interrogated the witness further as to the distance and defendant revised his estimate to \u201cabout three blocks.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">The court then asked several questions concerning defendant\u2019s knowledge as to what he was being held for at the time Boyce identified him when he was brought into the room at police headquarters. The district attorney then took over the questioning and asked defendant whether he knew that an attempt was to be made to identify him as the person who committed robbery. Defendant answered \u201cno,\u201d but that he knew that an attempt was to be made to identify him. He claimed that he was not told that he was being identified as a robber. In answer to the district attorney\u2019s question he said he told the inspector, \u201cIt didn\u2019t make any difference. I didn't do it.\u201d Q; \u201cDidn\u2019t do what?\u201d A: \u201cDidn\u2019t rob anybody or do anything.\u201d Q. \u201cThen you knew you were being charged with a robbery <em>1 </em>\u2019\u2019 A: \u201cNo, sir.\u201d This questioning was objected to on the ground that it called for a conclusion and was an attempt to put words in the defendant\u2019s mouth. The objection was overruled. The court then asked the defendant what he meant when he said he didn\u2019t do it. The answer was \u201cDidn\u2019t do anything. Period.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b123-7\">We conclude that in none of these instances did the trial judge abuse his power to interrogate witnesses. He did not indulge in such questioning as could have interfered with defendant\u2019s presentation of his case. He did not indicate bias either by question or by comment. Nor did he prejudice the defendant by permitting cross-examination beyond the scope of the direct examination.  Moreover, now to claim prejudice, defendant should have made appropriate and timely objection during the trial, which he did not. \u201cCounsel\u2019s correct course was to except to the ruling or to the language to which he objected and to move to strike from the record any prejudicial remarks of the court and to request that the jury be instructed to disregard them. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Galuppo, </em>81 Cal.App.2d 843, 849 [185 P.2d 335<em>] People </em>v. <em>Mendez, supra </em>[193 Cal. 39, 46 (223 P. 65)].) Failing thus to establish his record, in vain will he assail the conduct of the trial judge. \u2019 \u2019 <em>(People </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>87 Cal.App.2d 818, 827 [198 P.2d 60].)</p>\n<p id=\"b123-8\">(3) <em>Defendant claims prejudicial misconduct upon the part of the district attorney and the court </em>but the record shows that such a claim is without foundation.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>The principal incident to which defendant directs attention in this regard is a discussion between court and counsel concerning a question defendant\u2019s counsel wished to ask upon cross-examination of one of the arresting officers concerning a conversation he had with the defendant\u2019s parents as to the whereabouts of defendant the night the offense was committed.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">The district attorney objected that it was not proper cross-examination. After some discussion, the district attorney sug- \u25a0 gested, defendant\u2019s counsel agreed, and the court concurred, that it would be desirable to complete the discussion in the absence of the jury. The jury was excused and the court entertained an offer of proof. There ensued considerable discussion, as the result of which the court ruled that the question was proper. The jury was recalled, the question was asked, the witness answered, and then defendant\u2019s' counsel announced she had no further questions of that witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">The other acts of asserted misconduct were rulings upon questions which had been asked and answered, and- a few instances in which the court suggested that defendant\u2019s counsel make certain of her questions, upon cross-examination of Boyce, more specific; all, it would appear, quite proper and appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-7\">The judgment and the order appealed from are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-8\">Peters, P. J., and Bray, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b119-13\">Defendant does question the adequacy of proof that the robber was in possession of a deadly weapon (a pistol), upon the ground that the pistol was not produced. It was not necessary to produce the pistol. The testimony of the person robbed was sufficient.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
