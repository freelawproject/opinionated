The complaint alleges that plaintiff was injured while on a streetcar operated by defendant and that the accident was the result of the negligence of the motorman. As recited in appellant\u2019s brief, \u201cThe motorman brought his car to a halt with a jerk at the intersection ; the doors flew open; some of the departing passengers alighted; the doors closed; in the press of passengers who were entering and passengers who were riding in a standing position in the forepart of the car, other passengers who so desired had not yet alighted; they, including plaintiff, called \u2018Out\u2019 to the motorman; the motorman again jerked the car and opened the door; plaintiff was thrown to her knees and caught in the door, suffering severe injuries; she was then pulled and helped out of the car by strangers; the car sped away immediately. Plaintiff testified that the jerking of the car caused her to fall. Defendant offered no evidence relating to the operation of the car or to any other possible cause of plaintiff\u2019s fall.\u201d Respondent points out that, \u201cAppellant has prosecuted this appeal upon a partial transcript of the proceedings before the trial court consisting only of appellant\u2019s testimony.\u201d Respondent\u2019s description of the incident, in part, is as follows: \u201cAt the time appellant said \u2018out, please, \u2019 the streetcar had just barely started in motion. After it moved not more than a couple of inches, the operator immediately stopped the streetcar in accordance with appellant\u2019s request in order that she could leave the car. Indeed, on her <em>direct </em>examination, appellant testified that the streetcar had traveled only a couple of inches and stopped with \u2018just a jar.\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis included.)</p>\n<p id=\"b431-9\">It is contended on appeal that the court\u2019s finding, \u201cthat defendant\u2019s employee was not negligent is not supported by any substantial evidence in this record\u201d and that, \u201cA finding that plaintiff\u2019s \u2018injuries ... if any, were not proximately caused by reason of negligence on the part of the defendant ... or its agent or employee\u2019 is not supported by substantial evidence in this record.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b432-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>Respondent, on the other hand, argues that, \u201cAppellant was so thoroughly impeached on a material point that the trial court was justified in disregarding all of her testimony.\u201d In this connection the record reveals that plaintiff was still suffering from injuries received in a previous accident with relation to which respondent points out that, \u201cappellant was treated at the General Hospital on January 4, 1952, four days prior to the accident and the entries of the attending physician afford some insight into the credibility of appellant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-5\">\u201c \u2018January 4, 1952. STR and mobilization to entire spine. Pt. states she has no complaints and feels wonderful today but for me not to put this on chart for if I do they will stop treatments. \u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-6\">\u201cFurthermore, the clinical notes for appellant following the accident lists exactly the same complaints that she had prior to the accident and could be the basis for an inference that she suffered no new injuries on January 8, 1952.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b432-7\">The foregoing, although not a complete summary, is sufficient to indicate the record as presented to the trial judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-8\">As a matter of law the evidence is sufficient to support the findings in every respect.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-9\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-10\">White, P. J., and Drapeau, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-11\">Appellant\u2019s petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied May 27, 1954.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
