The petition for a writ of habeas corpus was predicated on substantially the same grounds advanced in the application now before us. The petition was denied by Division Two of this court. We are in accord with the conclusion reached by Division Two that the trial court did not abuse the discretion vested in it when bail pending appeal was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-16\">The application is therefore denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
