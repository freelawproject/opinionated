The amended complaint contains five causes of action including rescission <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>for fraud aud for breach of contract, damages for money advanced under a void contract, declaratory relief, and for money had and received.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-6\">Prom the findings and conclusions, it appears that the judgment was based on plaintiff\u2019s third cause of action, namely \u2018 \u2018 That the sale to plaintiff of the 1,000 shares of common stock of the Scarfanet Co., a California corporation, was in violation of the . . . Corporate Securities Act,\u201d in that no authorization had been granted for the issuance or sale of such stock, and that no application for such permission had been filed. The trial court concluded that \u201cthe sale and Memorandum of Agreement executed in connection therewith are illegal and void.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b723-7\">The record discloses that on October 6, 1950, a written memorandum of agreement, dated September 30, 1950, was signed by plaintiff Sampson and defendant Theodore J. Ticktin, who was president of the Scarfanet Company, reciting that Ticktin \u201cis entitled to receive 1,000 shares of the common stock of the' Scarfanet Co., . . . pursuant to an application of the said corporation for a permit to issue such stock to the second party, which permit has been filed or is about to be filed.\u201d Sampson therein agrees to pay \u201cthe sum of $10,000.00 in payment and as the consideration for 1,000 shares of common stock of the Scarfanet Co., . . . ; said stock being all of the outstanding and issued stock of the said corporation.\u201d Sampson likewise agrees to pay $500, \u201cfor an assignment of the indebtedness in the amount of $1,958.27 of the corporation to the second party (Ticktin) for monies advanced by the second party to the corporation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b723-8\">In addition to the above agreement, Sampson was given an assignment of license \u201cto manufacture a certain combination scarf and hairnet under the name of Scarfanet,\u201d signed by Theodore Ticktin, Joseph Landfield and Benjamin Sapoznik. Also dated the same day, September 30, 1950, is a memorandum of agreement \u201cto indemnify and hold harmless the Scarfanet Co.\u201d in reference to certain contract liabilities, which recites that Sampson \u201chas this day purchased all of the right, title and interest in and to 1,000 shares of the common stock of the Scarfanet Co. . . . being all of the issued and outstanding stock of said company to be issued pursuant to the Application for Permit to issue stock dated September 30, 1950.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b723-9\">A letter of the same date, was signed by Ticktin, Landfield <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>and Sapoznik, in which \u201cThe undersigned hereby agree that in the event that the Commissioner of Corporations . . . refuses to grant his permit for the contemplated issuance of 1,000 shares of common stock . . . the undersigned officers, directors and creditors of Scarfanet Co. . . . will cause said corporation to sell and transfer all of its property and assets to Benedict H. Sampson for the sum of $19,500.00,\u201d etc. Tiektin, Landfield and Sapoznik on the same day executed a power of attorney, authorizing Sampson \u201cTo execute an assignment to himself or his nominee of any certificate representing shares of stock issued to me by the Scarfanet Co. . . . pursuant to an Application for Permit to Issue Stock dated September 30, 1950, filed or to be filed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">It is contended by the appellants that the material findings of fact \u201care misleading and unsupported by the Record on Appeal,\u201d and that such findings are ambiguous, inconsistent, uncertain and indefinite. Appellants\u2019 basic argument is that the transaction in question between Sampson as purchaser, and Sapoznik, Tiektin and Landfield, (the only officers and directors of Scarfanet Company), was not within the purview of the Corporate Securities Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-6\">This argument is predicated on the assumption that \u201cThe essence of the transaction\u201d was that \u201cDefendants were selling a going business to plaintiff for an agreed price. The business had been incorporated, but no stock had been issued. . . . The corporation was therefore only a shell. ...\u201d The facts, says appellants\u2019 brief, \u201cwere tortured and twisted into a corporate sale of stock, and plaintiff recovered damages, sounding in tort, for the sale to him of \u2018void stock\u2019.\u201d According to appellants, \u201cSampson did not buy 1,000 shares of common stock of the Scarfanet Co., as found in Finding IV. He knew, at all times during the negotiations, that no such stock was in existence. The form of the transaction contemplated . . . was a future transfer of stock to-be-issued. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b724-7\">A review of the findings and conclusions of the trial court, and of the evidence disclosed by the record, fails to show any material ambiguities, uncertainties or inconsistencies which would in any manner tend to invalidate the judgment rendered. Appellants\u2019 brief singles out certain items of evidence by reason of which the trial court is alleged to have arrived at a wrong conclusion. But this position ignores the well established rule that \u201cevery favorable inference and presumption which may fairly be deduced from the evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>should be resolved in favor of the prevailing party. The prevailing party\u2019s evidence must ordinarily be accepted as true, and evidence which is contradictory must be disregarded.\u201d <em>(Scott </em>v. <em>Nevis, </em>120 Cal.App.2d 619, 621 [261 P.2d 797].) The present record undoubtedly discloses substantial evidence in support of the findings and judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-6\">As stated in the respondent's brief, \u201cThe contract documents themselves are the clearest evidence that the transaction between plaintiff and defendants involved a sale of corporate securities.\u201d The terminology used in the initial agreement between Sampson and Ticktin is that Sampson agreed to pay \u201cthe sum of $10,000.00 in payment and as consideration for 1,000 shares of common stock of the Scarfanet Co.\u201d Indeed, the word \u201cstock\u201d is used repeatedly in all of the documents connected with the transaction. The sellers were all of the officers and directors of the corporation, and as found by the trial court, \u201ceach and every defendant, in all the transactions with plaintiff, was acting in behalf of Scarfanet Co., . . . and on behalf of all other defendants.\u201d The facts were not \u201ctortured and twisted into a corporate sale of stock,\u201d as claimed by appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-7\">Section 25009 of the Corporations Code defines the term \u201cSale,\u201d as including \u201cevery disposition, or attempt to dispose, of a security or interest in a security for value.\u201d More specifically, it includes \u201can offer to sell, an attempt to sell; a solicitation of a sale; an option of sale; a contract of sale. \u2019 \u2019 Of course, the agreements and documents signed by the parties were not \u201csecurities\u201d; such writings merely evidence the intention to buy and sell the stock of Scarfanet Company. That the 1,000 shares of common stock, admittedly the subject matter of the transaction, was a \u201csecurity\u201d within the meaning of the Corporate Securities Act, cannot be doubted.  And, as said in <em>People </em>v. <em>Oliver, </em>102 Cal.App. 29 [282 P. 813], \u201cBecause the stock in a corporation was to be issued and delivered at a future date is no defense to this action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Ap0\">Appellants claim that the present transaction did not involve the corporation itself, said to be a mere \u201cshell\u201d; that it was a personal transaction by individuals disposing of a \u201cgoing business\u201d; that if \u201csecurities\u201d were involved, it was within the exemption covered by section 25152 of the Corporations Code which states that \u201cthe Corporate Securities Law does not apply to the sale of securities when (a) made by or on behalf of a vendor not the issuer or underwriter thereof <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>who, being a bona fide owner of the securities, disposes of his own property for his own account,\u201d is not persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">The trial court\u2019s finding that such was not the case is amply supported by the evidence which, among other things, discloses that the appellants were all of the officers and directors of Searfanet Company, and that Sampson paid all of the money for the purchase of the 1,000 shares mentioned in the documents, into the treasury of the corporation. Indeed, appellants\u2019 brief refers to the fact the funds were \u201cfunneled through the corporate bank account,\u201d and thereafter reached the hands of the appellants by way of corporation checks.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-6\">In this respect the ease is not unlike that of <em>Randall </em>v. <em>Beber, </em>107 Cal.App.2d 692, 699 [237 P.2d 994] where the reviewing court says: \u201cThese facts demonstrate that a sale of 200 shares of the capital stock of the corporation was made to the plaintiffs when they subscribed for them and paid the purchase price to the corporation . . . prior to the issuance of a state permit therefor. . . . The acts of the president and vice-president . . . each a director, in planning the sales . . . and the receipt of the purchase price for and its deposit in bank in the name of the corporation . . . made this sale .... The statute imposes penalties upon a corporation making such a sale, and upon each person who knowingly authorizes, directs, or aids in the sale. . . . Prom the imposition of these penalties in such a statute a legislative intent to void the proscribed \u2018sale\u2019 is inferred.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b726-7\">It is further contended that if the transaction was illegal, then Sampson was <em>in pari delicto </em>with the appellants by reason of Sampson\u2019s knowledge that no permit had been issued, and consequently is entitled to no relief.  However, as pointed out in respondent\u2019s brief, it has been held in <em>Austin </em>v. <em>Hallmark Oil Co., </em>21 Cal.2d 718 [134 P.2d 777], and elsewhere, that \u201cthe purchaser of a security is not <em>in pari delicto </em>with the issuer even though he may have knowledge of the fact that no permit has been issued. \u2019 \u2019 And, in the instant case, there is evidence that the appellants\u2019 attorney had informed Sampson\u2019s then attorney on October 6, 1950, that application for a permit had been filed and that a deputy Corporation Commissioner had said that everything was in order. There is no merit in this contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-8\">Neither in the cases cited in appellants\u2019 brief, nor in the evidence disclosed by the record, is any valid reason for reversal presented. The basic nature of the transaction seems <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>to have been correctly interpreted by the trial court as one within the purview of the statute. The damages awarded were not excessive.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-7\">White, P. J., and Drapeau, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-8\">A petition for a rehearing was denied May 18, 1954, and appellants\u2019 petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied June 23, 1954. Traynor, J., and Schauer, J., were of the opinion that the petition should be granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
