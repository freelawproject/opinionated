Defendant claimed a constructive eviction, and' it was not denied that he had vacated the premises before the beginning of the month.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-16\">The only question raised on this appeal is whether the facts constitute constructive eviction. It may be said that there is no dispute as to the facts, so far as they are presented on this appeal. Defendant\u2019s proof consisted of the introduction in evidence of the complaint, minutes, and record of the conviction of plaintiff\u2019s janitor, in a magistrate\u2019s court, on the ground of disorderly conduct; defendant\u2019s wife being .the complaining witness, and the charge being that the janitor, while intoxicated, annoyed defendant\u2019s wife by forcing his way into defendant\u2019s apartment and using loud and threatening language. On this charge the janitor was convicted and fined $10. Although the introduction of this testimony was objected to, it is not necessary to pass upon the value of the form of the objection taken to the introduction of this evidence, because for the purposes of this appeal it must be treated as a part of the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-17\">At the close of the trial it was conceded that the janitor\u2019s \u201cconduct was- upheld by the plaintiff, and that she still retains him in her employ as superintendent and engine\u00e9r or janitor of this apartment house.\u201d In support of his claim that there was no constructive eviction, plaintiff\u2019s counsel quotes -from the opinion of Page, J., in Manhattan Leasing Co. v. Schleicher (Sup.) 142 N. Y. Supp. 545. He <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>omits, however, the one sentence which renders the decision pertinent to the case at bar, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-3\">\u201cWhile we recognize that the tenant should be protected from insult, and that it is the duty of the landlord to use care in the selection of his servants, and if one transcends the proprieties, if necessary to the future enjoyment of the tenant, to discharge him and employ another, he must be given a reasonable opportunity to do so.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b375-4\">It appears to us that if the janitor conducted himself toward defendant\u2019s wife in the manner shown by the record, and the plaintiff, as landlord, sustained him in this attitude and continued him in her employ, the defendant was constructively evicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">Judgment reversed, and new trial granted, with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
