The different items of damage are set forth in separate paragraphs. The defendant pleaded, as a separate and distinct defense to the cause of action set forth in the fourth paragraph of the complaint, that after its alleged occupation the plaintiffs accepted from the owner of the land $200 in full payment of \u201cany and all claims for or on account of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>the alleged wrongful occupation.\u201d This is not a complete defense, and does not .purport to be a defense of any item of damage other than that set forth in the fourth paragraph of the complaint. It is at most a partial defense, and to be good should have been pleaded as such. The plaintiffs\u2019 demurrer, upon the ground that it was insufficient in law upon its face, should therefore have been sustained. A complete defense, when pleaded as such, must go to the entire cause of action set out in the complaint. If it does not, then it is demurrable.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">The interlocutory judgment appealed \u25a0 from is therefore reversed, with costs, and the demurrer sustained, with costs, with leave to defendant to serve an amended answer, on payment of costs in this court and the court below.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
