Action is upon a promissory note alleged to have been made by one Rowan, payable to the order of the Sunset Silver, Lead &amp; Zinc Mines Company, indorsed by defendant before delivery .to the payee and subsequently, before maturity, transferred to plaintiff\u2019s intestate. It was dated at Albany, N. Y., and there presented for payment, which was refused, and protest alleged to have been duly served. The answer is a general denial and affirmative defenses of payment, that the note was procured by fraud, and want of consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-10\">The defendant is a resident of Rensselaer county, N. Y., and plaintiff\u2019s intestate died a resident of Onondaga county, N. Y., and letters of administration of his estate were there issued to the plaintiff. It appears from the moving affidavits that defendant has five witnesses, besides herself, residing in Rensselaer county, whose testimony will be necessary and material upon at least one or the other of the issues in the action; that defendant is over 70 years of age, infirm, and unable to travel. It does not appear that the plaintiff has- a single witness residing in the city of New York.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-11\">Upon those facts I am of the opinion that the motion to change the place of trial should have been granted. The fact that the only necessary and material witnesses, so far as appears, reside in Rensselaer county, is sufficient of itself to justify the changing of the place of trial from such county to the county where the defendant resides.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-12\">The order appealed from is therefore reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion granted, with $10 costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
