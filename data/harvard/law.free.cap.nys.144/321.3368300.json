The plaintiff claimed to have been hired about October 15, 1912, and he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>was discharged on April 4, 1913. The answer denied the material allegations of the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\"><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> Accepting plaintiff\u2019s view of the causes of his illness, the weight of evidence is that he was an unsatisfactory employ\u00e9, because of his unexplained absence following pay day, whom defendant was justified in discharging. Jerome v. Queen City Cycle Co., 163 N. Y. 351, 356, 357, 57 N. E. 485; McGarrigle v. McCosker, 83 App. Div. 184, 188, 82 N. Y. Supp. 494, affirmed 178 N. Y. 637, 71 N. E. 1133.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> It- is established by a strong preponderance of evidence that plaintiff\u2019s employment was a hiring at will; his salary being calculated on a semimonthly basis. He had a right to leave and the defendant had a right to discharge him at any time. Watson v. Gugino, 204 N. Y. 535, 541, 98 N. E. 18, 39 L. R A. (N. S.) 1090, Ann. Cas. 1913D, 215; Aldrich v. N. Y.
