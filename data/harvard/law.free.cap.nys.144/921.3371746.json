It appearing that the fair market value was in excess of that sum, the order appealed from should be affirmed; but the fourth finding, should be modified, because it was unnecessary to determine the exact value of the land unimproved, in excess of the amount at which it had been assessed. The fourth finding of fact is therefore modified, so as to read: .</p>\n<p id=\"b947-14\">\u201cThat on the second Monday of January, 1910, the said property, unimproved, was of a market value in excess of 84,000,000.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b947-15\">As so modified, the order is affirmed, with costs to the respondent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
