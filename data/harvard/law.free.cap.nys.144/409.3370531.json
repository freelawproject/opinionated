On May 12, 1913, the defendant appealed to this court from that judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">That appeal was made up of record as it then appeared, and certified by the clerk and filed in this court. Subsequently it appeared that defendant, or some one in his behalf, had deposited $200, to secure the defendant\u2019s liberation, and a motion was made at Court of Special Sessions to correct the case on appeal, by inserting therein that fact. The Court of Special Sessions assumed to correct the record in this court, and directed the return of the original record filed here to have statement of that fact inserted in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\"><bracketnum>[ 1 ]</bracketnum> After a return is filed in this court it is for this court to Correct the record if it is improper, and the order of the Court of Special Sessions, assuming to correct the record is ineffective for any purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-7\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> The question is, whether a fact appearing subsequent to the taking of the appeal shall appear as .part of the record on which the case is to be heard in this court. We think the case is to be heard here upon the record as it existed at the time the appeal was taken, and if plaintiff wants to dismiss the appeal for any reason appearing outside of the record, or after the appeal was taken, the proper practice is for him to submit an affidavit setting forth that fact. As the record appears to be a correct record of the trial and the judgment at the time the appeal was taken, it would be impossible to insert in it the statement as to anything that was done after the appeal was taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-8\">This motion must be denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
