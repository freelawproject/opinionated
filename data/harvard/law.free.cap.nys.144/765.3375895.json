The plaintiff boarded a south-bound Fourth Avenue car at Astor Place, paid his fare, and received a transfer. He left the car at Chamber and Center streets. He first testified that he went to the courthouse and obtained a certified copy of an order and then went to the corner of' Chamber street and Broadway. After a motion to dismiss the complaint, upon the grounds, among others, that the plaintiff had proved that he did not make a continuous trip, in that he had stopped in the courthouse and transacted business, he testified in rebuttal that he was mistaken in his former statement that he had stopped in the courthouse.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-18\">As the trial judge gave judgment for the plaintiff, he must have accepted the plaintiff\u2019s later testimony. He further testified that on arriving at the corner of Chamber street and Broadway (which is conceded to be the transfer point) he walked up Broadway to Reade street, boarded a car, and handed his transfer to the conductor. The conductor accepted it, but almost immediately returned and informed the plaintiff that he would have to pay his fare, as* the transfer was not good at the point he boarded the car. Plaintiff refused to pay the additional fare, and at Murray street he was again requested by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"766\">*766</page-number>the conductor and an inspector to pay his fare, and, upon refusal, was ejected from the car by the inspector.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-5\"><bracketnum>[1, 2]</bracketnum> The rule requiring passengers having transfer tickets to board the cars at certain specified points is a reasonable regulation of their traffic, which passengers accepting transfers must observe. Conductors have no power to waive these regulations, and, upon plaintiff refusing to pay his fare, the employ\u00e9s of the road were justified in ejecting him from the car.' Hanley v. Brooklyn Heights R. R. Co., 110 App. Div. 429, 96 N. Y. Supp. 249; Elder v. International Ry. Co., 68 Misc. Rep. 22,122 N. Y. Supp. 880, affirmed 143 App. Div. 960, 128 N. Y. Supp. 1122; Weber v. Roch., Syr. <em>&amp; </em>Eastern R. R. Co., 145 App. Div. 84, 129 N. Y. Supp. 304.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-6\">The judgment should be reversed, and a new trial granted, with costs to the appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
