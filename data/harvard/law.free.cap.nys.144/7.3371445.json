The pump was installed prior to September, 1912, and defendants used the same, apparently continuously, until the city\u2019s water pressure made it unnecessary, some two months later. The defense is that the pump \u201cran hot\u201d because its shaft was out of alignment. In view, however, of defendants\u2019 retention and use of the pump, the defense, even if. proved, was unavailing. Logan v. Berkshire Apartment House, 3 Misc. Rep. 296, 22 N. Y. Supp. 776; Turl v. Knabe, 26 Misc. Rep. 770, 56 N. Y. Supp. 1017. Judgment reversed, and new trial granted, with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
