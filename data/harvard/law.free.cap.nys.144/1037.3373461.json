Judgment is demanded against both defendants for that amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b1065-5\"><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> If the Steel Company is the successor of the Box Strap Company by reason of a statutory consolidation, the liability of the former for the contract obligations of the latter is declared by statute. See Irvine v. N. Y. Edison Co., 207 N. Y. 425, 101 N. E. 358, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1040\">*1040</page-number>statutes cited. In that case doubtless the liability of both companies would be on the same contract. This, however, is not so where corporations are merged. See Irvine v. N. Y. Edison Co., supra, and statutes cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b1066-5\"><bracketnum>[2-4]</bracketnum> The plaintiff has not intelligently alleged the facts upon which it seeks to hold the Steel Company. It has employed the word \u201csuccessor,\u201d which in the case of corporations ordinarily indicates a statutory succession. See \u201cSuccessor\u201d and \u201cSuccessor in Interest,\u201d Words and Phrases Judicially Defined. It is most difficult to ascertain from the allegations of the amended complaint just what plaintiff means by the allegation that the Steel Company is the successor to the business and interests of the Box Strap Company; but we must, nevertheless, construe the pleading. We are of opinion that it does not mean that one corporation has succeeded the other by virtue of a statutory merger or consolidation, but that the Steel Company has succeeded to the business and has taken over the assets and has assumed liabilities of the Box Strap Company, including any liability then existing or thereafter accruing under the contract with the plaintiff. On that theory the liability of the Steel Company to the plaintiff, if any, rests on some agreement with the Box Strap Company by which it succeeded to its business and assumed its liabilities. It is not alleged, and it cannot be fairly inferred, that the liability of the Steel Company, if any, is based on the original contract between plaintiff and the Box Strap Company, and therefore there has been a misjoinder of causes of action. Stein v. Whitman, 103 N. E. 1133, reversing 156 App. Div. 861, 142 N. Y. Supp. 4, on dissenting opinion. If the plaintiff meant to charge separate violations of the contract by the defendants, then there is an attempt to state two causes of action without alleging facts on which both defendants would be liable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1066-6\"><bracketnum>[5, 6]</bracketnum> On the theory that the plaintiff has attempted to allege merely an assignment of the contract and an assumption of liability, there has been a novation, and it has, by bringing this action, accepted the liability of the assignee in place of the corporation originally liable, at least in so far as the contract was unperformed at the time of the assignment, and for any subsequent breach of the contract the assignee only would be liable. Dane v. United Oilcloth Co., 103 App. Div. 378, 92 N. Y. Supp. 1061. The court erred therefore in overruling the demurrers on the ground that causes of action had been improperly united.</p>\n<p id=\"b1066-7\"><bracketnum>[7]</bracketnum> The plaintiff does not allege that there was more than one breach of the contract; nor does it definitely allege when the breach of the contract on which the action is predicated arose. Possibly the inference is that it arose after the assignment. A period of less than three months elapsed between the date of the contract and the date of the assignment, and plaintiff alleges that the failure to supply the automatic strapping machines was by both defendants; and it is specifically alleged that the breach by the assignee was after, it succeeded to the business. Those allegations, I think, tend to show that the breach, of which. complaint is made, occurred subsequent to the assignment. It would seem therefore that the plaintiff fails to show a cause of action against the Box Strap Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b1067-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1041\">*1041</page-number><bracketnum>[8, 9]</bracketnum> Another question arises, however, with respect to the sufficiency of the allegations concerning the liability of the Steel Company, and it hinges on the point as to whether the allegations that that company succeeded to the business and interests of the Box Strap Company and has assumed its assets and liabilities, including any liability upon the agreement, are sufficient allegations _ of the facts, or whether they constitute allegations of legal conclusions. It may be that those allegations are sufficient to show that in some manner or other the Steel Company acquired the assets and business of the Box Strap Company; but that would not make it liable primarily for the debts and obligations of the Box Strap Company. Its liability therefor would be limited to the value of the assets thus received and would accrue only after the creditors exhausted their remedies against the Box Strap Company. The only allegation we have, therefore, upon which the liability of the Steel Company can be predicated, if at all, is the bare allegation that it assumed the liability of the Box Strap Company. In the circumstances, I am of opinion that this is neither an allegation of a fact, nor an allegation of a conclusion of fact from any facts fairly stated or warranting an inference to that effect. It is manifest that no indictment for perjury would lie on this allegation, for if 'stated positively it may well be merely the opinion of the officer who verified the pleading that such is the legal effect of an assignment, or other transfer, of the business, and for aught that appears the succession of the Steel Company to the business and assets of the Box Strap Company, intended to be set forth by these allegations, may have rested in paroi.</p>\n<p id=\"b1067-4\">It is possible that since the Box Strap Company, the original party to the contract, is sued and a violation of the contract is alleged, if the plaintiff has failed to allege facts sufficient to show liability on the part of the Steel Company on the theory of a novation, it would be entitled to recover in any event against the Box Strap Company. We do not, however, deem it necessary to express a decided opinion with respect to the sufficiency of the causes of action attempted to be alleged against either defendant, for the reason that the amended complaint is so inartistically drawn and so defective in many respects that doubtless it will be presented in a different form when amended-pursuant to the leave to be granted on sustaining the demurrers on the ground of misjoinder of causes of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b1067-5\">It follows therefore that the order should be reversed, with costs, and the demurrers sustained, with leave to the respondent to amend on payment of the costs of this appeal and of the demurrer, and with leave to discontinue as to either defendant on payment of costs to such defendant. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
