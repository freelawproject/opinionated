The slanders are alleged to have been uttered in conversations and discourses \u201cwith merchants in said borough and city with whom plaintiff already had and contemplated business relations,\u201d \u201con or about the 1st day of April, 1912, and on div\u00e9rs dates about that time, during the months of April and May.\u201d It is alleged that, by reason of the utterance of such slanders:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-18\">\u201cA number of merchants and persons, and in particular the copartnership firm of Samuel Horowitz &amp; Co., 441 Broadway, borough of Manhattan, New York City; Samara Bros., 81-85 Washington street, of said New York City; Labe Importing Company, 98 Washington street, in said New York City; S. Handak &amp; Bros., of 136 Liberty street, in said New York City\u2014who had heretofore been accustomed to deal with the plaintiff in his business aforesaid and was about to and contemplated dealing with him, plaintiff, and extending plaintiff a line of credit, ceased to deal with him and refused to continue to deal with him and to extend credit,\u201d etc.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b502-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>The allegation as to the persons who ceased to deal with plaintiff and those who refused to extend credit are not limited to the four firms named, but are stated as \u201ca number of merchants and persons.\u201d Under this allegation the plaintiff may prove upon the trial any and every merchant and person, in addition to those named, who ceased dealing with him and who refused to extend credit.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">The defendant is entitled to know the persons in whose presence or to whom the slanderous words are claimed to have been spoken, and, when it is alleged that damage was sustained in consequence of the refusal of individuals to deal with plaintiff, the defendant is entitled to know the names of such persons in order to prepare for trial. The law in this respect is so well settled that a citation of authorities is unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">If it be true that the plaintiff intended to confine his allegations to the four persons named, the defendant is entitled to have him say so.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-7\">The order must be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion for a bill of particulars of the matters specified in the second, fifth, and eighth subdivisions of the notice of motion granted, with $10 costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
