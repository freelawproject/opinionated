The most that appears is that he had signed what the affiants in the moving, affidavits state was a \u201cformal resignation,\u201d giving its form. What became of this paper does not appear; non constat it may have been lost, destroyed, or withdrawn.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-18\">Order reversed, with costs, and judgment reinstated.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
