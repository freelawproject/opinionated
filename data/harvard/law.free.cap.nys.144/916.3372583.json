The case was tried March 21 and 22, 1911, and a verdict directed for the defendant. An appeal was taken to this court and the judgment was reversed and a new trial ordered in May, 1912. 150 App. Div. 918; 135 N. Y. Supp. 822.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-18\">The moving affidavit avers that, since the entering of the order granting a new trial, plaintiff has taken no steps whatever to place this case upon th\u00e9 trial calendar, although, under the rules and practice, the case could have been immediately placed upon the calendar and pressed to trial, and that junior issues have been tried. The motion was made on a notice dated November 19, 1913. It has been many <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"917\">*917</page-number>times held that the burden is upon the party moved against to establish sufficient and reasonable grounds for his delay. We are of the opinion that the plaintiff has not sustained that burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-5\">\u2022The order appealed from is therefore reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements to the appellant, and the motion to dismiss the complaint granted, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
