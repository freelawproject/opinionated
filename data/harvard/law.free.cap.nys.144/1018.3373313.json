The car was propelled upon the tracks in the performance of the regular business of a carrier. The street sweeper was in his uniform, and was in the performance of his duties. The duty was upon the motorman to look out for people upon the street, so it was the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1019\">*1019</page-number>duty of the decedent to look out for himself. If by reason of his conspicuous uniform he could be readily distinguished by the motorman, so the sweeper, with his knowledge of the frequent movements of cars upon the tracks, could have easily seen the approaching trolley car if he had looked. Although he was there as of right and in the performance of his duties, yet nevertheless this did not relieve him of all responsibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b1045-5\">From the fact that the car was stopped within its own length after the accident, it is evident that the motorman had it under control. It is not to be presumed that he deliberately ran down the sweeper. From the facts proven the inference is as readily drawn that the sweeper suddenly stepped in front of the car, and so close thereto that it was impossible for the motorman to stop in time to avoid the collision, as it is that the accident was due to the want of vigilance of the motorman. In other words, the plaintiff, having the burden, has failed to show that the accident was due to the negligence of. the defendants\u2019 servant, and that her intestate was free from contributory negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1045-6\">The defendants moved to dismiss at' the close of the plaintiff\u2019s case, and, standing upon their exception, put in no evidence. The judgment and order appealed from should be reversed and the complaint dismissed, with costs to the appellants. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
