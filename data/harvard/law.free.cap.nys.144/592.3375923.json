H. Ludwig \u201cduly\u201d assigned to plaintiff a certain claim against the defendant Andreas C. Bosselman and the judgment obtained thereon and which lies at the foundation of this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>The second separate defense consists of an attack upon these assignments as fraudulent and inoperative. Among other denials stricken out of this defense is the denial that Ludwig \u201cduly\u201d assigned the claim and judgment. The effect is to leave the defendants as admitting that the assignments were \u201cduly\u201d made. Whether the effect of this admission would be to nullify the second separate defense we need not now decide, but it is clear that defendant ought not to be forced into the position of relying upon an inconsistent defense which may be held to have been nullified by the involuntary admission of a fact which they seek to deny.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">The order appealed from will therefore be so modified as to strike out of the second defense all of the denials except that the assignments were \u201cduly\u201d executed. In other respects the order is right. It will therefore be modified in accordance with this memorandum, and as modified affirmed, without costs to either party. Settle order. on notice.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
