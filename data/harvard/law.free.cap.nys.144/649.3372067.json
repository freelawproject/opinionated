The answer states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b675-26\">\u201cFor a further separate and distinct defense the defendant alleges: * * * \u201cIII. Upon information and belief that between the 1st day of January, 1908, and the 1st day of November, 1912, at divers places within the city of New York, state of New York, and in the city of Philadelphia and state of Pennsylvania and at other places unknown to the defendant, but at what particular times and places the defendant is unable to state, the plaintiff has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>committed adultery with one or more men whose names are unknown to the defendant. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-3\">\u201cWherefore defendant demands judgment that the complaint be dismissed with costs.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b676-4\">The defendant moved for an order \u201cdirecting that the issues of adultery raised by the defendant\u2019s answer\u201d be tried by a jury. From the order denying the motion the defendant appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">The defendant contends: (1) That \u201csection 1757 of the Code expressly gives either party the right to have the issues of adultery * * * tried before a jury\u201d; (2) that the so-called defense was clearly intended as a counterclaim, and that upon proof of the allegations of adultery the defendant is entitled to a decree of absolute divorce; and (3) that the right to have issues of adultery tried by a jury is not restricted to a case where the issue is raised by a complaint or a counterclaim, but must be deemed to include a case where the issue is raised \u201cas a material defense to an action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b676-6\"><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> Section 1757 gives either party the right to have the issues of . adultery tried in an action for divorce. It does not apply to an action for a separation. Packard v. Packard, 88 App. Div. 339, 342, 84 N. Y. Supp. 1090. That section is incorporated in article second, entitled \"action for a divorce.\u201d In article third, which provides for an \u201caction for a. separation,\u201d there is no provision for a trial, by jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-7\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> But the issues of adultery, raised by the interposition of a counterclaim, may, under section 1770, be tried by a jury in an action for a separation. Section 1770 reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-8\">\u201cSection 1770. (Am\u2019d, 1881.) What is deemed a counterclaim. Where an action is brought by either husband or wife, as prescribed in either of the last two articles, a cause of action, against the plaintiff and in favor of the defendant, arising under either of said articles, may be interposed, in connection with a denial of the material allegations of the complaint, as a counterclaim.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b676-9\">This section is embodied in article fourth, entitled \u201cProvisions applicable to two or more of the actions specified in this title.\u201d \u201cThe last two articles,\u201d alluded to in the section, are the articles captioned \u201cAction for a Divorce\u201d and \u201cAction for a Separation,\u201d respectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-10\">In Van Benthuysen v. Van Benthuysen, 2 N. Y. Supp. 238, the court (Mayham, J.) said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-11\">\u201cPrior to the enactment of chapter 703 of the Laws of 1881, amending section 1770 of the Code of Civil Procedure, it seemed well settled on authority \u25a0that the defendant in an action of this character [action for a separation] could not set up the adultery of the plaintiff as a counterclaim, and demand judgment for the dissolution of the marriage contract\u201d (citing cases). \u201cBy the enactment of that amendment, a radical change was effected in the provisions of section 1770. * * * By that amendment the words in said section, \u2018the same articles,\u2019 were stricken out, and the words, \u2018either of said articles,\u2019 were substituted in their stead, so that facts which before the . amendment were good as a counterclaim to one of said actions were extended to and- become good as a counterclaim to either of said kinds of actions when accompanied by a denial of the allegations of the complaint. * * * It follows, therefore, that the allegations of adultery in the answer, if properly made, constitute a counterclaim on which the defendant may demand judgment for an absolute divorce.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b677-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number><bracketnum>[3]</bracketnum> If in this case, therefore, the defendant properly set up, as a counterclaim, the plaintiff\u2019s adultery, he is entitled to have that issue determined by a jury. He says it was clearly intended as a counterclaim. However clear the intention, it was not clearly expressed; it was not, in fact, expressed at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">(a) The answer does not specifically denominate the defense a counterclaim.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">In Bates v. Rosekrans, 37 N. Y. 409, 412, the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-7\">\u201cI think the answer given by the court below is also a sound- one, to wit, that the pleading does not purport to be a counterclaim. It designates itself as \u2018a further defense\u2019 simply, and there rests. No particular form of words is necessary to make a pleading a counterclaim; and, if the party had, in any reasonable language, intimated that he intended to make a personal claim in his own favor against the plaintiff, it would have been sufficient. The ordinary and most satisfactory form of giving that intimation is by a statement that the pleading is a counterclaim, or by a prayer for relief.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b677-8\">In Fulton Co. G. &amp; E. Co. v. Hudson River T. Co., 200 N. Y. 287, 291, 93 N. E. 1052, 1053, it was said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-9\">\u201cUnder the provisions of the' Code of Civil Procedure, which prescribe the fabric and regulate the exercise of a counterclaim, the facts alleged as a counterclaim must be sufficient to constitute a perfect cause of action in favor of the defendant and against the plaintiff, and to sustain the judgment against the plaintiff which the defendant thereby seeks <em>and must demand. </em>Sections 501, 509. They must be alleged as a counterclaim in order that they shall not be deemed a mere defense.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b677-10\">And in Equitable Life Assurance Society v. Cuyler, 75 N. Y. 511, 514:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-11\">\u201cAs a distinction exists between a defense and a counterclaim, when the defense is intended as a counterclaim it should be explicitly stated in the answer, so as to advise the opposite party; and, in the absence of such an allegation, especially when the party defines and characterizes his answer as a defense, and it is uncertain whether a counterclaim is intended, such party is not in a position to insist that he has actually set up a counterclaim, and the answer should be construed and considered as a defense.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b677-12\">(b) The answer does not contain a prayer for affirmative relief. The relief demanded is purely negative, such a demand as usually accompanies a defense merely; i. e., the dismissal of the complaint.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-13\">\u201cThere can be no recovery by way of counterclaim where there is no demand for affirmative relief in the answer.\u201d Montanye v. Montgomery (Com. PI.) 19 N. Y. Supp. 655.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-14\">\u201cWhere the defendant deems himself entitled to an affirmative judgment against the plaintiff, by reason of a counterclaim interposed by him, he must demand the judgment in his answer.\u201d Section 509, Code of Civil Procedure.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b677-15\">The order should be affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
