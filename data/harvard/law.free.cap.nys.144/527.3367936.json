The defendant, a railroad corporation, acquired by a condemnation proceeding a right of way through what is practically the center of plaintiff\u2019s property. The award was satisfactory to the plaintiff and accepted by her, and the order of confirmation was duly entered. The strip acquired, 150 feet in width, consisted of about six acres. Upon this strip, lawfully authorized by the state so to do, the defendant proceeded to erect a \u201cfill\u201d or embankment, over which, when' completed, it was designed to lay railroad tracks. The embankment was 35 or 40 feet in height, and 3,800 feet in length. Through the plaintiff\u2019s and the defendant\u2019s property, in a direction intersecting the proposed embankment, 'flowed Casperkill, a natural running stream from 1 to 3 feet in depth and varying in width from 2 to 10 feet. It was arranged and stipulated in the condemnation proceeding that in the taking of the land by the defendant was included no right to interfere with this stream. To provide for the free passage of the stream through the embankment, the defendant built a culvert in dimension 6 feet 4 inches wide and 5 feet high, giving an opening equivalent in diameter to a 5-foot circle. The foundation for the culvert was laid upon hard clay, 7 feet or more beneath the surface; the excavation therefor being 13 feet wide and 121 feet in length. The culvert itself was strongly built of concrete. Its top or cap was a concrete slab 18 inches thick, reinforced with 70-pound rails laid at intervals of less than a foot apart. Upon this slab were piled dirt and rocks to a height estimated variously as 28 and 35 feet. At this elevation lay the bed of the railroad. When the embankment was about completed, the culvert collapsed, the whole thing buckled up', and when it sank the bank sagged with it. The creek, thus blocked, backed up and flooded the plaintiff\u2019s land, damaging her real and personal property and interfering with her business of manufacturing brick. The extent of the damage was vigorously disputed.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-7\">The complaint was founded upon the theory of negligence, and much evidence was given in proof and disproof of that ground of liability on the part of the defendant in selecting the foundation or bed upon which the culvert eventually rested. The immediate foundation was a very dry, compact, yellow clay, underneath which was a stratum of blue clay. It was sought by the plaintiff, with some success, to show that clay ivas a bad foundation where it was likely that water would penetrate. On the other hand, the defendant submitted evidence to the effect that careful boring to a depth of 20 feet had been made preparatory to selecting the foundation, that 20 feet of \u201creasonably dry <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>clay\u201d made a good foundation, and\"that a good foundation could be put on even wet clay.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-4\">For a number of years the defendant had run its railroad through another embankment on this property, close to and almost parallel with the new embankment. The old embankment had been settling year by year. From one of the defendant\u2019s expert witnesses the plaintiff elicited the admission that such a condition would have made him suspicious and he \u201cwould dig deeper.\u201d The defendant\u2019s contention was that the sinking was due to some unknown action or cause below the clay, as a quicksand or a muck pocket.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">In the record appears this colloquy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-6\">\u201cMr. Lown: I think Mr. Morschauser, in his complaint, has seen fit to allege that this was built negligently. * * * The Court: I think I will submit the case to the jury on a different theory. * * * I think it is a question of a private nuisance.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b555-7\">In its charge to the jury the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-8\">\u201cIf the defendant, the railroad company, in the course of its work, closed up this natural water course by any obstruction or permitted it to become closed, if, in other words, the culvert, which it constructed upon this property collapsed and fell into this stream and closed it up, and thereby caused the waters to back up over the plaintiff\u2019s property, the defendant in that event is liable to the plaintiff for her actual money damages. If, in other words, the culvert gave way and collapsed and fell into and filled up this passageway, this water course that had been provided for this stream, and thereby overflowed the plaintiff\u2019s premises, and caused her damage, the railroad company is liable to the plaintiff, no matter whether the defendant\u2019s work was negligently done or not, no matter how much care was used or skill exercised in the construction of this culvert. If it did give way and fill up this water course and obstruct the same and cause the water to overflow the plaintiff\u2019s property, the railroad company is liable.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b555-9\">Again, in its opinion on the motion for a new trial, the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-10\">\u201cSince the verdict was rendered by the jury, I have carefully considered the briefs submitted by the defendant\u2019s counsel in support of the motion to set aside the verdict, and have examined all of the authorities cited; but I am not persuaded that I erred in charging the jury as I did. I am convinced that the stopping of the natural flow of the stream by the defendant, thereby flooding the plaintiff\u2019s brickyard, makes the defendant liable to the plaintiff for his actual damage, regardless of the question of negligence. If that is not the law, I think it ought to be.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b555-11\">Efficient exceptions to these rulings were interposed, and, as has been stated, an appeal is taken from the order denying the motion to set aside the verdict and for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-12\">Liability has been imposed upon the defendant for consequences irrespective of any considerations of care and.skill, upon the theory that the rightful possession of the plaintiff was wrongfully disturbed and that direct, necessary, and immediate injury was caused to her property. The defendant contends that error was thus committed, as the correct rule is that, if one do a lawful act on his own premises, he cannot be held liable for consequential injuries that may result unless it was so done as to constitute actionable negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-13\">The law of nuisance is not involved. Uline v. N. Y. C. &amp; H. R. R. R. Co., 101 N. Y. 98, 107, 4 N. E. 536, 54 Am. Rep. 661.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>The distinction in the application of the rules of liability is clearly pointed out in the leading cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-3\">In Hay v. Cohoes Co., 2 N. Y. 159, 51 Am. Dec. 279, a canal company was authorized to dig a canal. In so doing it was necessary to blast rocks with gunpowder, and fragments of rocks were thrown against and injured plaintiff\u2019s adjoining lands and dwelling. The defendants were held liable for the injury, although no negligence or want of skill in executing the work was alleged or proved. A long line of cases, including St. Peter v. Denison, 58 N. Y. 416, 17 Am. Rep. 258, Noonan v. City of Albany, 79 N. Y. 470, 35 Am. Rep. 540, and Huffmire v. City of Brooklyn, 162 N. Y. 584, 57 N. E. 176, 48 L. R. A. 421, in which the facts disclosed that there was a physical invasion of the lands damaged, or that the injury was the direct, immediate, and necessary result of the act of. the wrongdoer, followed the principle announced in Hay v. Cohoes Co., supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-4\">In Bellinger v. New York Central Railroad, 23 N. Y. 42, a railroad company was authorized to build a railroad across a creek adjoining plaintiff\u2019s land. It bridged the creek. On occasions of freshets the land of the plaintiff was covered with ice and strewn with flood wood and rubbish, his soil was washed off, and his fences were carried away. These effects were attributed by witnesses to the construction of the bridge and the embankment. It was held that the property injured was not thereby taken, as the railroad company was acting with lawful authority under the sanction of the state; that the damages were consequential ; and that unless the railroad company committed or omitted some act which constituted actionable negligence there could be no recovery. The rule there announced has been followed in Atwater v. Trustees of the Village of Canandaigua, 124 N. Y. 602, 27 N. E. 385, Moyer v. N. Y. C. &amp; H. R. R. R. Co., 88 N. Y. 351, and Gordon v. Ellenville &amp; Kingston R. R. Co., 195 N. Y. 137, 88 N. E. 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">The law is that where a railroad company is authorized to construct its road over a given route, which involves the necessity of crossing a stream running through its own property, and its operations are confined to its own land, and there is no trespass and nothing is disclosed by which it is proved that the injurious result must necessarily have followed the prosecution of the work itself, the inundation of the plaintiff\u2019s land by the blocking up of the stream, caused by a collapse of the work in the course of construction, presents a case where the damagesj are consequential and are not recoverable unless the injury was caused by misconduct, negligence, or unskillfulness. Gordon v. Ellenville &amp; Kingston R. R. Co., supra; Prime v. City of Yonkers, 192 N. Y. 105, 84 N. E. 571; Booth v. R., W. &amp; O. T. R. R. Co., 140 N. Y. 267, 35 N. E. 592, 24. L. R. A. 105, 37 Am. St. Rep. 552.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">This case was submitted to the jury upon the assumption that the defendant was absolutely liable, and the judgment entered upon the verdict against the defendant must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-7\">Judgment and order reversed, and a new trial granted; costs to abide the event. 'All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
