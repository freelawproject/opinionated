The evidence, however, is that the driver, a niece of the, defendant, residing in his household, was not operating the machine for the general purposes, or any special purpose, of the defendant, but for her own purposes. Defendant could not, therefore, be held liable for her negligence, even had such negligence been proven. Maher v. Benedict, 123 App. Div. 579, 580, 108 N. Y. Supp. 228; Cunningham v.
