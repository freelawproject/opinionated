Thereupon the following paper was executed and delivered:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b32-15\">\u201cNew York, November 20, 1911.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b32-16\">\u201cReceived of Mr. Angus S. MacDonald $30 as a deposit (subject to conditions printed below) to secure the apartment on the sixth floor, five rooms of the house No. 530 Claremont Ave., rent to commence on December 1, 1911, and to be $60 per month. It is also agreed between the parties hereto that the balance of the first month\u2019s rent is to be paid and the lease from December 1, 1911, to September 30, 1912, to 'be signed before December 1, 1911, at 12 o\u2019clock noon, or the above deposit is to become forfeited. The above deposit is accepted only upon the express condition that an inquiry into the general standing and character of the prospective tenant proves entirely satisfactory in every way to the landlord, or his agents, and said landlord and his agents reserve the right to refund any deposit made. E. Doctor, Agt.\u2019-\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b32-17\">On the back of the receipt the following was written:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b32-18\">\u201cRepapering of apartment, painting, varnishing, and shellacking floors, shelves where necessary, and bathroom to be put in good condition. Telephone to be desk instrument; shades to be in good condition.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b32-19\">\u201cE. Doctor, Agt.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b32-20\">It being apparent that no question of the statute of frauds enters into this case, this instrument evidences either a completed lease, or an agreement to execute a lease, upon all the terms of which both parties had agreed and which the defendant had signed by his authorized agent, and which the plaintiff had accepted (apart from any other considerations) by making a deposit thereon. So that, under the circumstances, plaintiff, being in default, was not entitled to recover, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>defendant was entitled to recover upon his counterclaim for the balance of the rent due, if properly proved.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-5\">Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
