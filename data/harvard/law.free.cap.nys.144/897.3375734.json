No demurrer which might have been brought on for trial by motion (Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7 976) was interposed to the counterclaim. The judgment dismissing the counterclaim was entered pursuant to an order made on the plaintiff\u2019s motion for judgment dismissing it.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"898\">*898</page-number><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> We do not deem it necessary to consider the sufficiency of the counterclaim, for that question could not be presented for decision by a motion which, if granted, would not dispose of all of the issues in the action and entitle the moving party to a final judgment thereon. Code of Civil Procedure, \u00a7 547; Stevenson v. Devins, 158 App. Div. 616, 143 N. Y. Supp. 916 (First Dept., decided November 7, 1913).</p>\n<p id=\"b924-5\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> The learned\" counsel for the respondent attempts to sustain the judgment on the theory that it is in effect an interlocutory judgment; but it is not interlocutory, either in form or substance; and, if it were, section 547 of the Code of Civil Procedure, pursuant to which the motion was made, does not make the notice of motion equivalent to a demurrer to a pleading, upon sustaining which an interlocutory\u2022 judgment may be entered. The provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure authorizing a demurrer as a pleading and providing for the disposition of issues of law arising thereon have been retained.. Code of Civil Procedure, \u00a7\u00a7 421, 965-969; Maeder v. Wexler, 43 Misc. Rep. 19, 87 N. Y. Supp. 402; Bigelow v. Drummond, 109 App. Div. 132, 95 N. Y. Supp. 1027. Nor can the judgment be sustained on the theory that the order severed the issues in the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-6\"><bracketnum>[3]</bracketnum> The Code of Civil Procedure authorizes the severance of the issues in an action in certain cases (Code of Civil Procedure, \u00a7\u00a7 497, 1220); but this motion was not made for that relief, and manifestly the case does not fall within the provisions of those sections. Moreover, in the absence of such severance on motion, it is the general rule that there can be only one final judgment in an action; and, while this rule, has exceptions arising from different dispositions of issues on the trial or on appeal which constitutes a practical severance, the case at bar does not fall within them. Bauer v. Hawes, 115 App. Div. 492, 101 N. Y. Supp. 455; Schuller v. Robison, 139 App. Div. 97, 123 N. Y. Supp. 881; City of Buffalo v. D., L. &amp; W. R. R. Co., 176 N. Y. 308, 68 N. E. 587; Altman v. Hofeller, 152 N. Y. 498, 46 N. E. 961. See, also, Draper v. Interborough Rapid Tr. Co., 124 App. Div. 357, 108 N. Y. Supp. 691.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-7\">It follows, therefore, that the order and judgment should be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and motion denied, with $10 costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
