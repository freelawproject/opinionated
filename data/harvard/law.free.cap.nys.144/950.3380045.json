By the particulars now sought the defendant, among other things, seeks to obtain the name of the person whom the plaintiff\u2019s assignors claimed to have informed that they had sustained a prior loss by theft; also the representative of the defendant to whom the policy is claimed to have been returned for correction, and the person who agreed to change the policy in the manner set forth in the complaint. The other particulars asked for are along the same general line.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-9\">The defendant, being a corporation, which acts only through its representatives, is entitled to know the names of the persons in its employ, or representing it, with whom the plaintiff\u2019s assignors claim they made the special agreement in question. Sittig v. Cohen, 130 App. Div. 689, 115 N. Y. Supp. 332. It appears, from the defective bill of particulars heretofore served, that one Harry A. Wilkus and one Bernard Frank are in a position to furnish the plaintiff with information concerning many of the matters upon which particulars are sought.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-10\">The order appealed from will therefore be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion for a further bill of particulars granted, with $10 costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
