Americana Company et al. He alleges upon informa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1072\">*1072</page-number>tian and belief that the defendants settled the litigation with his client without his knowledge or consent. It, however, appears from the affidavit of Phineas M. Bond, the secretary and assistant treasurer of the defendant corporations, who has charge of the records thereof, as well as knowledge of all disbursements made by them, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1098-5\">\u201cNo money or other consideration has been paid the said plaintiff by the defendant in settlement of this action, nor any settlement whatsoever made with him by the defendant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1098-6\">Under these conditions, this order cannot be sustained, based, as it is, upon the theory that a settlement has actually been made in some form or other by his client with the defendants, without his consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1098-7\">The order will therefore be reversed, with $10 and disbursements, and the motion denied, with $10 costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
