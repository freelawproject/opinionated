Plaintiff was registered as a seaman, presumptively familiar with the ordinary duties of a seaman, and there is no evidence that there was anything unusual, intricate, or inherently dangerous in the character of duties plaintiff was required to perform, which would call for special instruction on the part of the defendant. There is evidence that the defendant\u2019s officer, the third assistant engineer, compelled plaintiff, by the use of physical force, to continue working when his hands were blistered and infected. It is doubtful whether the evidence is sufficient to constitute a cause of action against the defendant under maritime law. It certainly does not furnish a legal basis for an action in negligence brought in a Municipal Court. This action was tried solely on the ground of negligence; the court charging the jury that plaintiff could not recover for the negligence of any fellow servant, but that he could recover for negligence of an officer in authority, and refusing to charge, at defendant\u2019s request, that the third assistant engineer was not in authority over the plaintiff and was a fellow servant.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-9\"><bracketnum>[1,2]</bracketnum> Under the common law it is well settled that all members of a vessel\u2019s crew, except the master, are deemed to be fellow servants, for whose negligent or tortious acts toward each other the owner of the vessel cannot be held liable. See Gabrielson v. Waydell, 135 N. Y. 1, 7-14, 31 N. E. 969, 17 L. R. A. 228, 31 Am. St. Rep. 793; Scarff v. Metcalf, 107 N. Y. 216, 13 N. E. 796, 1 Am. St. Rep. 807. Unless, therefore, the Employers\u2019 Liability Act of this state is applicable, plaintiff has failed to make out a cause of action. Notice was served under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>the Employers\u2019 Liability Act; but, so fa,r as the record discloses, the action does not come within the purview of that act. This statute, regulating the conditions under which labor .may be .performed within the state and the obligations of employers in connection therewith, has no applicability to torts committed without the state; our Legislature having no extraterritorial jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">Plaintiff having failed to make out a cause of action, either at common law or under the Employers\u2019 Liability Act, the judgment must be reversed, with costs, and the complaint dismissed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
