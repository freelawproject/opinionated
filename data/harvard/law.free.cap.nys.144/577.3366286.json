On May 2d, the plaintiffs sent a truckman to the defendant\u2019s pier with the arrival notice. The truckman paid the carrying charges, but failed to obtain the goods. The clerk to whom the notice was tendered wrote the word \u201cshort\u201d across the notice. The word \u201cshort\u201d is concededly the term used when goods cannot be found on the unloading of a car in which they were supposed to be shipped. On May 2d, the defendant sent the plaintiffs a second arrival notice. On May 4th, one of the plaintiffs in person asked for the goods, bringing the original notice marked short, and a clerk again stated that the goods could not be found, and added: \u201cDon\u2019t you see they are marked short?\u201d On May 7th the same plaintiff called at defendant\u2019s office again, and asked for the goods.- The clerk again failed to find the goods, and advised the plaintiff to put in a claim, which the plaintiff did on May 10th. On May 17th the plaintiffs received a third arrival notice, but made no further efforts to ob<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>tain the goods, relying on the claim which they had put in. The defendant attempts to meet this evidence by showing the arrival of the goods on April 29th, and the sending out of the successive notices, and by showing that the person in charge of shortages was the property clerk, and that if the plaintiffs had applied to him they would have received the goods.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">It is the contention of the defendant that the plaintiffs were negligent in failing to make other and further efforts to obtain the goods, and especially in failing to apply to the proper clerk in charge of the shortages.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">Upon this record I cannot find that the defendant\u2019s contention is sustained. It was the defendant\u2019s duty as carrier to deliver the goods on reasonable demand. The plaintiffs made three demands upon persons apparently held out as the clerks by whom deliveries were to be made, men who were working in defendant\u2019s office at a desk marked \u201canswers.\u201d It was not the-duty of the plaintiffs to go further, and at their peril ascertain the business organization of the defendant, or whether there was a man in that organization whose duty \u25a0it was to seek out shortages. The plaintiffs had done their full duty when they made three fruitless demands on the defendant in its of1 fice, upon clerks who were apparently clothed with authority to answer inquiries, especially when one of these clerks then told them to make a claim, and the claim was received and investigated by the defendant. The plaintiffs\u2019 failure to make these inquiries, of the clerk in actual charge of the shortages would be material only if the plaintiffs failed to prove that they made inquiries of the persons held out for this purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-7\">Judgment should be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to appellants to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
