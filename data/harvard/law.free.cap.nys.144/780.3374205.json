Plaintiff, after testifying that he had ridden on elevated trains for five years on an average of three times a day, was asked whether the stopping of the car the day he was hurt was done in the same manner 'as he had observed it previously, whether it stopped differently from the way he had observed cars were usually stopped, and in what manner the car was stopped with reference to the way it was stopped previously. To each of such questions an objection, on the ground that they were incompetent, irrelevant, and immaterial, and called for a conclusion of the witness, was sustained; the court stating, in ruling on the objection to the first question, that the stop might have been an unusual stop, and yet show no negligence, that \u201cthe question here is simply, \u2018Was this a sudden stop, and was the sudden stop produced through the negligence of the defendant?\u2019 * * *</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b807-6\">It might have been a very unusual stop, and yet not sufficient to show negligence on the part of the defendant.\u201d \u00bb</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b807-7\">Argued November term, 1913, before LEHMAN, PAGE, and WHITAKER, JJ.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b807-8\">Morris &amp; Samuel Meyers, of New York City (Herman Druclc and Samuel Meyers, both of New York City, of counsel), for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b807-9\">James L.

That on or about the 15th day of March, 1911, the plaintiff was a passenger for hire on one of defendant\u2019s cars upon said Second Avenue Elevated Railroad. That at or near the Eightieth Street station of said elevated railroad defendant, its agents or servants, negligently, carelessly, and violently stopped said car upon which said plaintiff was riding, so as to throw plaintiff in such a manner that plaintiff\u2019s left foot was caught between the car upon which plaintiff was riding and the car following and coupled thereto.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b807-12\">\u201cThird. That solely by the aforesaid negligence of the defendant, its agents or servants, and without fault or negligence on plaintiff\u2019s part, the plaintiff was negligently, carelessly, and violently thrown against the railing of said car, and his foot was caught and crushed between the bumpers of the car upon which plaintiff was riding and the car following and coupled thereto, whereby' plaintiff was injured. * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b807-13\"><bracketnum>[1, 2]</bracketnum> The evidence given on behalf of plaintiff was substantially as follows: That oh March 15, 1911, he paid his fare at the Ninety-Ninth Street and Second Avenue elevated station and there boarded a car of a downtown train. That there were other people standing on the platform of said car, about 10 in number, and that he remained on the platform of said car until the train was about to reach the Eightieth Street station, when there was a sudden stop of the train. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"782\">*782</page-number>That at the time of this sudden stop he held onto the stanchion, but notwithstanding it threw him towards the next car, and his left foot went into the space between the two cars. It must be assumed that the evidence given by plaintiff was true, arid plaintiff was entitled to all proper and legitimate inferences to be drawn therefrom. Kraus v. Birnbaum, 200 N. Y. 130, 93 N. E. 474.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-3\"><bracketnum>[3]</bracketnum> If the train operated by defendant\u2019s servants was stopped so suddenly and violently as to throw the passengers down or against any portions of the car, and such violent or sudden stop was not necessary to the successful operation of the car, the jury would have been justified in finding the defendant guilty of negligence. See Hassen v. Nassau Electric R. R. Co., 34 App. Div. 71, 53 N. Y. Supp. 1069, and cases there cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-4\"><bracketnum>[4]</bracketnum> There was, we think, sufficient evidence to go to the jury upon this question. \u2022 The evidence would probably have been much stronger, had the court not, as we think erroneously, excluded the testimony of the witness Mintz and the plaintiff upon this subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-5\"><bracketnum>[5]</bracketnum> The fact that plaintiff was riding upon the platform did not of itself constitute contributory negligence. Edwards v. N. J. &amp; H. R. R. &amp; F. Co., 144 App. Div. 555, 129 N. Y. Supp. 717., If the car was crowded, and the plaintiff remained upon the platform without objection by the guard in charge of the train, it was not contributory negligence. The evidence showed that the car was crowded, and fails to disclose any warning or objection upon the part of the guard. Cattano v. Met. St. Ry. Co., 173 N. Y. 565, 66 N. E. 563, and Hassen v. Nassau Electric R. R. Co., supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-6\">The judgment should be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
