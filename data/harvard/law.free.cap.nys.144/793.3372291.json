The defense replied to set up the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act of New Jersey (Act April 4, 1911 [P. L. p. 134]). In the reply, plaintiff denied knowledge or information sufficient to form a belief as to the New Jersey statute.</p>\n<p id=\"AOA\"><bracketnum>[1, 2]</bracketnum> The learned court below cites Olsen v. Singer Mfg. Co., 143 App. Div. 142, 127 N. Y. Supp. 697, as controlling authority. Counsel points out that, as appears from another opinion in that case, re'ported in 151 App. Div. 516, 135 N. Y. Supp. 872, it is claimed that plaintiff was a resident of New Jersey, and seeks to distinguish the case from the one at bar because of that fact. Whether the distinction be good or not, the law of another state must be proved like any other fact. Even though it should be regarded \u201cas a matter of record,\u201d and no regard be paid to the fact that it is a matter of record in another state, it is the plain intimation of the Court of1 Appeals in its latest decision on this point (Kirschbaum v. Eschmann, 205 N. Y. 127, 132, 98 N. E. 328)- that such matters may properly be put in issue by a denial of knowledge or information \u201cso as to put the plaintiffs to their proofs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b820-14\">Order reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and motion denied, with $10 costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
