His complaint sets out a cause of action in tort, namely, fraud and duress, upon proof of which plaintiff is entitled, as is said by the Court of Appeals in Gould v. Cayuga County Bank, 99 N. Y. 333, 341, 2 N. E. 16, 19, \u201cto have such compromise agreement made as good for him as it reasonably and fairly would have been if only the truth had been told.\u201d He may recover \u201cthe true value of the disputed claim, and not the false value.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b797-6\"><bracketnum>[8]</bracketnum> By the act of the court below, the action has, against plaintiff\u2019s desire, been converted into one on contract; and it must be said, in passing, that it is very doubtful whether the complaint as so changed states any cause of action. It is, of course, elementary that plaintiff has his own election, in an appropriate case, to sue either in contract or tort. Rich v. N. Y. C. &amp; H. R. R. Co., 87 N. Y. 382.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-7\">Order reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and motion denied, with $10 costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
