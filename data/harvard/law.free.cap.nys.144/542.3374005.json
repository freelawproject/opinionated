The defendant was in default of payment. After frequent demands for payment on the part of the plaintiff, he gave the plaintiff, who was-old, unfamiliar with the English language, and of defective sight, two checks aggregating $500. The plaintiff, on discovering with the aid of another person the purport of the checks, immediately returned to the defendant\u2019s office. He endeavored upon the- trial to tell what then took place, but was prevented by the objection of the defendant\u2019s counsel and the ruling of the trial court. The complaint was dismissed at the close- of the plaintiff\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-16\">The recitation of the evidence is meager because the evidence itself is such. It was sufficient, however, to have authorized the jury to find that the plaintiff owned the automobile and was entitled to its possession under the terms of the agreement of rental, and that upon demanding past-due rental he received postdated checks for a sum greatly in excess of the amount due for rental. 'It is clear that he made an-effort to show that the defendant tricked him by handing him checks and claiming they were payments upon a sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-17\">The defendant attempts to sustain the dismissal upon the ground \u2022that there was no proof of a demand for the return of the chattel, which was lawfully in the possession of the defendant under the agreement of rental. Evidence of a demand was unnecessary, as a demand .was alleged in paragraph 6 of the complaint and not denied in the answer. The judgment should be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-18\">Judgment and order of the County Court of Kings county reversed, and a new trial ordered; costs to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
