The defendant did not produce the play, and plaintiff\u2019s action is to recover the sum of $2,000, less the sum of $350 paid on account upon signing the contract. The answer admits the making of the contract, and that the defendant did not produce the play, and by way of defense sets forth an alleged custom by which a license for the production of a play by a well-known performer is deemed to be exclusive within the territory\" and for the period for which it is granted, and that the plaintiff violated the condition of the agreement imposed by such custom, by granting to some other person, without the knowledge or consent of the defendant, a license to produce the same play within the term and territory limited by the contract. The defendant further counterclaimed to recover the $350. Upon the trial the learned judge held this contract to be ambiguous for the reason that it was not specified therein whether the right to produce the play was exclusive or not and held that the burden was upon the plaintiff to prove that the license was not exclusive. The case was submitted to the jury upon this theory,</p>\n<p id=\"b654-12\">This was manifest error. The language of the contract is plain and unambiguous. The defendant is given the right to produce the play with limitation as to the time and place. If it had been intended that a further limitation was to be placed upon the plaintiff\u2019s rights over the play in the meantime, words expressive of that intention could and- should have been embodied in the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-13\">The assertion by the defendant of the existence of a custom that would impose'-such a limitation upon the plaintiff did not render the contract ambiguous.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-14\">\u201cOustom is to be resorted to in the construction of contracts, only in cases of doubt or ambiguity as to their meaning. It is not available to create such a doubt or ambiguity.\u201d Marlatt v. Erie Ry. Co., 154 App. Div. 388, 391, 139 N. Y. Supp. 771, 773.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b655-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number><bracketnum>[3]</bracketnum> The burden rested upon the defendant to prove the existence of such a well-known custom that the parties must have contracted with the intention and expectation that it would apply to their contract. In my opinion the defendant\u2019s evidence does not establish the existence of such a custom. If such a custom exists, it is strange that all the licenses to produce a play upon which judicial action has been sought, either to restrain the violation of defendant\u2019s exclusive right or to obtain damages for a violation thereof, have had the words \u201csole\u201d or \u201cexclusive\u201d inserted before the words \u201cright to produce.\u201d The fact that no reference to such a custom is made in the various text-books on the subject would inferentially negative its existence as an open and well-known custom in this particular business.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">The judgment should be reversed, and a new trial granted, with costs to the appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
