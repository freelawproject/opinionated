The answer denies these allegations, except that the defendants admit \u201chaving received certain materials from the plaintiffs above named, which the defendants paid for in full.\u201d The answer further sets forth an affirmative defense that the work was not properly done, and that the merchandise furnished was unmarketable and was returned, or its return tendered, to the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-5\"><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> There can be no question but that under the pleadings the affirmative was upon the plaintiffs, and they had the right to open and close. It appears that at the trial, after both parties had opened to the jury, the defendants\u2019 attorney stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b793-6\">\u201cI will concede that the plaintiffs would have been entitled to the balance for which this action was brought, if the goods had been properly made.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b793-7\">The plaintiff.then testified that he sold caps to the defendant, and the defendant examined them. The plaintiff then rested, and the defendant took the stand, and testified that some of the caps made by the plaintiff were defective, and were returned by them to the plaintiff, and the trial thereafter developed practically into a trial of this issue. When the evidence was all in, the trial justice stated that the defendant had the affirmative on this issue, and gave it the right to close. The plaintiffs duly excepted to this ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-8\">It seems to me that there can be no doubt that this ruling was erroneous. The material allegations of the complaint were not admitted by the answer, and the plaintiffs at the beginning of the trial had the burden of proving these allegations. Even if the subsequent concession of the defendants was sufficient to satisfy this burden, and to leave merely an affirmative defense to be litigated, and I am unwilling to concede that the concession was sufficient even for this purpose, still the right to open and close is determined by the pleadings at the beginning of the trial, and cannot be changed by any concessions made during the trial.

E. 1102.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-9\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> This right in a jury trial is substantial, and its denial requires the reversal of the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-10\">Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-11\">PAGE, J., concurs.
