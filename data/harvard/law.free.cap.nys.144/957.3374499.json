Proc. \u00a7 3256, providing that a party to whom costs are awarded in an- action is entitled to his necessary disbursements, the stipulation must be construed as declaratory of the statute, and not casting upon the unsuccessful party the burden of all fees and disbursements, regardless of the imposition of costs, and where the claimant was in part successful she is not entitled to disbursement when not allowed costs.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b983-11\">[Ed.

At the beginning of the reference the parties entered into a stipulation fixing the referee\u2019s fees at $10 an hour, and $10 for each adjournment of which he was not duly notified, and also for the stenographer\u2019s fees; the stipulation ending with the phrase, \u201cbe taxed as a disbursement in the action.\u201d Technically, these words apply only to the stenographer\u2019s fees, but the case has been submitted on the assumption that they apply both to referee\u2019s and stenographer\u2019s fees. The referee reduced plaintiff\u2019s claims to $539.30, and found that they had not been unreasonably resisted, and that plaintiff was not entitled to costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-6\">I think the order appealed from was wrong. Formerly the Code provided that, on reference of a claim against a decedent\u2019s estate, \u201cthe prevailing party\u201d shall be entitled to referee\u2019s and witness fees and other necessary disbursements. The section of the Code now allowing disbursements (3256) makes such allowance dependent upon the recovery of costs, as in civil actions generally. The section reads: \u201cA party to whom costs are awarded in an action is entitled\u201d to his necessary disbursements. The section does not cover referee\u2019s fees beyond $10 a day, nor stenographer\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-7\">The respondent argues that the intention of the stipulation was to cast upon the unsuccessful party the burden of all fees and disbursements that might be taxed under the stipulation. I do not so construe it. I think it meant what similar stipulations have always been taken to mean, namely, that the party ultimately liable for costs shall also be liable for the disbursements as fixed in the stipulation, and that the right to tax disbursements follows the right to costs as an incident thereof. To construe this stipulation as entitling the plaintiff to his disbursements would put the executor in the position of having conceded away a statutory immunity granted for the protection of the estate, an intent wholly unjustified by any words to be found in the stipulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-8\">The order should be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion to vacate the taxation granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-9\">INGRAHAM, P. J., and SCOTT and DOWLING, JJ., concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b984-10\">CLARKE, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AR_\">I dissent. It seenis clear that by the stipulation the disbursements referred to, namely, the referee\u2019s and stenographer\u2019s fees, were to be taxed. Of course, if they were to be taxed, they were to be taxed in favor of the prevailing, party. The fact that costs were not allowed to the prevailing party does not affect the question, because the stipulation was that said fees were \u201cto be taxed as a disbursement,\u201d and not \u201cas the costs of the case.\u201d The stipulation should be lived, up to.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-11\">I vote to affirm the order appealed from.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
