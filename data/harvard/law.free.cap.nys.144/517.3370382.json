The answer alleges for a first defense that the injuries complained of were caused in whole or in part by the contributory negligence of the plaintiff; and for a second defense, by the negligence of a competent fellow servant or fellow servants. The plaintiff moved for a bill of particulars specifying: First, the facts showing what acts the plaintiff committed and which constituted his contributory negligence; second, the facts showing the acts of negligence of the competent fellow servant or fellow servants, which contributed to the accident. And from the order granting said motion the defendant appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-10\">Prior to the trial the defendant should not be compelled to state the particulars required and thus limit and define its possible defense. Plaintiff knows what he did and is required to prove his cause of action. Until he and his witnesses disclose the facts, it would be extremely difficult, if not impossible, for the defendant company to comply with this order. It should not be thus improperly hampered. Upon considerations of sound public policy we have not allowed general examinations before trial in negligence cases. Wood v. Hoffman, 121 App. Div. 636, 106 N. Y. Supp. 308. It seems apparent that, if an order should require the defendant to give the particulars of the claimed contributory negligence, the court must be prepared to-grant an application for an order for plaintiff\u2019s examination before trial to enable defendant to comply with the order for particulars. We.are unwilling to embark on this course of procedure. The defense of contributory negligence in its very nature precludes the\" necessity -for particularization. In our opinion this discretionary order should.hot have been granted. .</p>\n<p id=\"b544-11\">The order appealed from should be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements,;.-and the motion denied,, with $10 costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
