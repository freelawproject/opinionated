The work which plaintiff\u2019s fellow servant was called upon to do was not such as called for any special skill, and, in fact, such fellow servant was quite able to do his part of the work properly, and in the great majority of cases did so. So far as he was concerned, the only trouble was that he was careless, and, if that carelessness can be said to have been the proximate cause of the accident, it was the negligence of a fellow servant, not that of the employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> The evidence does not show that the dangers incident to the work were \u201cnot patent to plaintiff\u2019s observation.\u201d What dangers there were were perfectly apparent, and the plaintiff testified that he was perfectly aware of them, in addition to which he was expressly warned by one of the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">In our opinion the verdict was clearly against the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">Judgment and order appealed from reversed, and new trial granted, with costs to appellant to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-7\">CLARKE, DOWLING, and HOTCHKISS, JJ., concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b705-8\">INGRAHAM, P. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AY_\">(dissenting). I do not agree that the finding that the defendants were negligent was against the weight of evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-9\">The plaintiff, an infant, was 18 years of age. He had been in the defendants\u2019 employ about a month and was paid about $5 a week. He was put to work on this machine on the morning on which the accident happened. The plaintiff testified that the defendants instructed him in operating this machine to put his hands under the die under certain conditions. That this was a dangerous thing to do was apparent, and I think where such instructions are given, and the plaintiff, an infant, follows such instructions, and an accident results, it is a question for the jury to say whether, under all the circumstances, it was not a negligent act for an employer to give such instructions to an infant employe, thus subjecting the employ\u00e9 to the risk of an injury. It is, I think, a failure to properly instruct an infant put at work at such a machine, and it was at least a question for the jury to say whether, under the circumstances, proper instructions had been given to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-10\">I am therefore in favor of affirming the judgment.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
