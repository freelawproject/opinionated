See Barone v. O\u2019Leary, 44 App. Div. 418, 60 N. Y. Supp. 1131. It is true that there have been some decisions intimating that a bill of particulars of the defense of payment will never be ordered. No doubt, cases in which opinions to this effect have been rendered were properly decided on the facts there disclosed, and the opinions have merely stated the rule more broadly than was called for. There seems, however, to be no reason why, under circumstances like those disclosed in the case at bar, where plaintiff alleges, without contradiction, that the relations between defendant and himself have been numerous and diverse, and moneys have passed between them in these relations, respectively, particulars should not be furnished of the items which defendant claims constituted payment of plaintiff\u2019s debt. Sittig v. Cohen, 130 App. Div. 689, 115 N. Y. Supp. 332.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-7\">Order reversed, with disbursements to appellant, and motion granted as to items 1 and 2 of plaintiff\u2019s moving affidavit, being the dates and amounts of payments claimed.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-8\">S.EABURY, J., concurs.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b798-9\">GUY, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AqY\">(dissenting). While recognizing the soundness of the principle enunciated in the majority opinion that in exceptional cases, such as those involving an examination of an insolvent\u2019s accounts, a bill of particulars as to alleged payments may be ordered, I am of opinion that the case at bar does not come within the exception. The plea of payment herein is, in effect, a plea that,'as the result of extended and varied dealings between the parties, plaintiff has been paid all moneys to which he is entitled as growing out of the matters set forth in the complaint. A bill of particulars of such payments might necessitate the setting forth of defendant\u2019s entire evidence on this subject. At least it is such a doubtful case that it should be left to the Appellate Division to determine whether it is such an exception as was contemplated by their ruling in the Barone Case.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-10\">Leave to appeal should therefore, be granted defendant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
