Bayliss, as justice of the Municipal Court, is as follows:</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b814-3\">It is evident from the testimony of the son of the defendant that the defendant\u2019s wife in no sense requested the plaintiff to perform the operation for which compensation is herein sought, and that the operation was made possible by what at the most can be found to be passivity and nonresistance on her part. No agency is shown in any other members of the family sufficient to bind the defendant for such services.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b814-4\">No question has been raised as to the reasonableness of the charge made by the plaintiff, nor as to the professional skill and ability exercised by him in the operation, and while there is no question but that the plaintiff should be paid therefor, we feel that he has not sustained the burden of proof which is upon him herein.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b814-5\">Argued December term, 1913, before MADDOX, JAYCOX, and ASPINADD, JJ.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b814-6\">Daniel A.
