It is a contract complete in all particulars. There is no effort made to reform it, nor any contention that it was procured by fraud or misrepresentation. It was executed in January, and the automobile was not delivered! <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>until March. Meantime plaintiff never objected to the form of the contract, nor sought to have it changed, nor to have any further warranty inserted therein. When she gave her order she was shown by defendant\u2019s representative an Itala car with a limousine body, and he told her the chassis would be just the same. That one so shown her she knew was.a 25 horse power car. The alleged warranties upon which she has brought action were: (1) That the automobile would be of 25 to 35 horse power; and (2) that it could be used on all roads in the state of Connecticut and would have sufficient clearance to be used on all roads in that state. Upon the trial, plaintiff abandoned any effort to recover upon the second warranty and stood upon the first alone., She testified that she told defendant\u2019s representative when he showed her the sample car before the contract was signed that she did not want a 25 horse power car, as she then had a 30 horse power one and desired one of more power, to which he replied that 25 horse power meant that it developed 35 horse power; that she relied on this representation and believed it, and would not haVe bought the car had she not so believed. \u2019 She received the car March 28th or 29th, giving an old car in exchange and paying the balance due on the contract. At her request a certificate of ownership of the new car was obtained from the Secretary of State of Connecticut March 1, 1912. That described it as an Itala car, of 18 to 24 horse power. She had signed the application therefor on February 29, 1912, describing the car in the same manner. On March 29, 1912, she took out policies of insurance in the General Accident, Fire &amp; Life Assurance Corporation, Ltd., of Perth, Scotland, and the Royal Exchange Assurance of London, in both of which the automobile was described as an Itala car of 18 to 24 horse power. It sufficiently appears that the car did develop 25 horse power; plaintiff\u2019s complaint is that it should have developed more power.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">We think her contention is without merit. The contract between the parties was explicit, unambiguous, and complete upon its face. It purports to express the full agreement of the parties. Plaintiff is not seeking to recover upon some matter as to which the contract is silent, but upon an alleged departure from the express terms of the contract itself. Where a written contract provides that a car sold is to be of 25 horse power, the law presumes that the parties intended and agreed that such should be the capacity of the car to be delivered, and, in the absence of fraud or deceit, the parties will be held to that agreement and no other. As was said in Bighmie v. Taylor, 98 N. Y. 288:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-7\">\u201cIf we may go outside of the instrument to prove that there was a stipulation not contained in it, and so that only part of the contract was put in writing, and then, because of that fact, enforce the oral stipulation, there will be little of value left in the rule itself. The writings which are protected from the effect of contemporaneous oral stipulations are those containing the terms of a contract between the parties, and designed to be the repository and evidence of their final intentions. If upon inspection and study of the writing, read, it may be, in the light of surrounding circumstances in order to its proper understanding and interpretation, it appears to contain the engagements of the parties, and to define the object and measure the extent of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>such engagement, it constitutes the contract between them, and is presumed to contain the whole of that contract.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b586-3\">And in Thomas v. Scutt, 127 N. Y. 133, 27 N. E. 961, the court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-4\">\u201cReceipts, bills of parcels, and writings that evidently express only some parts of the agreement are examples of this class which leaves the written contract unchanged, but treats it as part of an entire oral agreement, the remainder of which was not reduced to writing. Two things, however, are essential to bring a case within' this class: (1) The writing must not appear upon inspection to be a complete contract, embracing all the particulars necessary tomake a perfect agreement and designed to express the whole arrangem\u00e9nt between the parties, for in such a case it is conclusively presumed to embrace the entire contract. (2) The paroi evidence must be consistent with and not contradictory of the written instrument.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">In Studwell v. Bush, 206 N. Y. 416 [100 N. E. 129], it was said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-6\">\u201cOf course, if the plain meaning of written contracts may be avoided by paroi evidence that the. parties agreed they meant something which they did not say, we have reached a summary and effectual method of destroying some of the important principles which have heretofore controlled the construction of written instruments.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b586-7\">That paroi testimony to prove a warranty as to present quality, condition, or power of the thing sold is inadmissible in the face of a written contract which is upon inspection apparently complete, because containing all the terms and conditions necessary to a complete agreement, has been held in a long line of cases, as far back as Filkins v. Whyland, 24 N. Y. 338, and as recent as Standard Co. v. De Pass, 154 App. Div. 525, 139 N. Y. Supp. 611.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-8\">It was error to receive evidence of any claimed oral warranty herein, and its receipt furnished no basis for a recovery by plaintiff. It follows that plaintiff failed' to establish any cause of action, and that the motion to dismiss the complaint at the close of her case should have been granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-9\">The determination of the Appellate Term and the judgment of the City Court should be reversed, with costs to appellant, and judgment directed in favor of defendant dismissing the complaint of the plaintiff, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
