Obviously the plaintiffs, to sustain the judgment, must show that the cases became damp or wet while in the charge of defendant or a connecting carrier. The evidence shows that the cases were packed in plaintiffs\u2019 factory at Stamford, Conn., and shipped to plaintiffs\u2019 place of business in New York City. They were examined there by plaintiffs\u2019 employ\u00e9s and found in good condition. They were delivered on June 7th to a truckman to be carted to defendant\u2019s freight station, and he received a receipt from defendant, stating that the goods were in \u201capparent good order, contents and condition of contents unknown.\u201d They were shipped on a car going to Detroit, and arrived in that city on June 9th.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>The evidence shows that there was no delay in transit. They were delivered on June 10, 1911, to William Galow, a truckman employed by the T. R. Collins Trucking Company, and they were then apparently in good condition, and a receipt was signed by the truckman stating that they were in good order. The Collins Trucking Company was the authorized truckman for the consignees and delivered the cases to them. When the cases were examined by the consignees, they were damp on the outside, and wet on the inside.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-4\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> I think that from the above statement of the testimony- it is clear that there is absolutely no evidence that \"the cases were allowed to become wet or damp before they were delivered to the consignee\u2019s truckman. So far as the evidence shows, they were then apparently in the same condition as when received. The mere fact that they were thereafter found to be damaged allows no inference that they were damaged while in the railroad car, in the absence of evidence by the truckman that they did not become damaged while in his possession. The jury\u2019s verdict that they were damaged on the railroad therefore rests, not on proof, but on conjecture.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">The judgment should be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
