Laws 1909, c. 31), is a machine guarded against accidents which may be reasonably expected to occur, or which in the exercise of reasonable care the master should have anticipated were likely to occur.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-23\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> While the machine in this case was guarded to an extent, it was not guarded sufficiently to prevent the hand of plaintiff\u2019s fellow servant, when'it slipped, from' coming in contact with the lever and causing the plunger to descend, with injurious consequences to plaintiff. In view of the evidence that articles from time to time fell to the floor, which it was necessary for some one to pick up, we think that it was a question of fact for the jury, rather than of law for the court, as to the master\u2019s duty in the premises.
