Plaintiff\u2019s counsel offered the note in evidence,' and the notice of protest, the amount of interest due, and rested. The defendant Stappler was called as a witness in his own behalf, and testified that at the time he gave the note he told the payee it must return the note before it became due, and if he (defendant Stappler) kept the 500 marmots (being the goods delivered to him on memorandum) then Stappler would pay the payee the difference between the face of the note and the merchandise retained, to which the payee replied he would return the note before it became due.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\"><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> This is about all the evidence the court would allow the defendant appellant Stappler to give upon this question. Prior to that the defendant appellant had made a formal offer to prove by the defendant Stappler the agreement alleged in the answer, viz., that the note was not to be negotiated by the payee. The court refused to allow the testimony, and the appellant duly excepted. This was, I think, reversible error. However, the evidence the appellant was finally permitted to give upon the subject was uncontradicted, so that I think the defendant appellant is entitled to take the position that the contract alleged in the answer was'either proved or that he was refused permission to prove it. If proved, it was incumbent upon the plaintiff to have shown affirmatively that he was a bona fide holder for value. Plaintiff only proved possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-7\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> While possession is presumptive evidence of title, this presumption is rebutted where the appellant proves the note to have been negotiated in breach of faith or under such circumstances as amount to fraud. Canajoharie Nat. Bank v. Diefendorf, 123 N. Y. 191, 206, 25 N. E. 402, 10 L. R. A. 676; American Ex. Nat. Bank v. N. Y. Belting Co., 148 N. Y. 698, 43 N. E. 168; German American <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>Ex. Bank v. Cunningham, 97 App. Div. 244, 89 N. Y. Supp. 836; Negotiable Instruments Law (Consol. Laws 1909, c. 38) \u00a7\u00a7 94-98.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">If the appellant proved the contract alleged in his answer, which I think he did, the plaintiff\u2019s evidence of simple possession was insufficient to sustain his action. If the appellant was not permitted to prove the contract, that was reversible error, so that in either event the judgment should be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">The appellant was not permitted to show by the plaintiff, whom he called as a witness, what plaintiff paid for the note, or that plaintiff took said note with notice of its diversion, or that plaintff was not the bona fide owner of the note, or that plaintiff paid nothing for the note.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-7\"><bracketnum>[3]</bracketnum> Appellant was not permitted to give evidence that Jacob Reich, the plaintiff\u2019s assignor, was the real owner of the note; that Jacob Reich had full notice of the original diversion of the note and that he was the financial backer of George Sachs &amp; Co.; and that he knew all the circumstances under which the note was given, and that he was practically the original owner of the note, although it was made payable to Sachs &amp; Co. This was reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-8\">The judgment should be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
