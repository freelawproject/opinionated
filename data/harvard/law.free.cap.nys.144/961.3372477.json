Plaintiff then obtained an order to examine Schwartz in proceedings supplementary to execution, and it was developed upon such examination that he was employed by the defendant corporation at a salary of $12 a week. Thereupon plaintiff caused a transcript of the judgment to be filed and docketed in the county of New York, and thereafter obtained an order in the Supreme Court, under section 1391 of the Code of Civil Procedure, directing the sheriff to collect from the defendant 10 per cent, of Schwartz\u2019s salary. This order was duly served, but defendant paid no attention to it. Plaintiff waited until 10 per cent, of the salary of the judgment debtor \u25a0\u2014if the same had been deducted as directed in the order\u2014would have satisfied the judgment, and then brought this action in the Municipal Court of the City of New York to recover such amount. The defendant interposed an answer, in which it claimed the salary of Schwartz had, prior to the service of the order, been reduced from $12 to $10 a week. This was the issue tried and the jury rendered a verdict in favor of the plaintiff, upon which judgment was entered. An appeal was taken to the Appellate Term, where the judgment was reversed, on the ground that the Municipal Court did not have jurisdiction of the subject-matter of the action and dismissed the complaint. The judgment was reversed, and complaint dismissed on the authority of Weisel v. Old Dominion Steamship Co., 99 App. Div. 568, 91 N. Y. Supp. 140. That authority, as I read it, has no bearing whatever on the question here presented. It neither justified a reversal of the judgment nor a dismissal of the complaint. There, plaintiff sought, under section 1391 of the Code of Civil Procedure, to collect in the Municipal Court a judgment recovered in the Supreme Court. It was held that the Municipal Court did not have jurisdiction. This was right because the Municipal Court does not have jurisdiction of an action upon a judgment of the Supreme Court for the reason that its jurisdiction is extended only to an action upon a judgment rendered in any court, not being a court of record. Municipal Court Act (Laws of 1902, c. 580) \u00a7 1, subd. 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-10\">The judgment against Schwartz was recovered in the Municipal Court, and, when the defendant failed to withhold from his salary 10 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"963\">*963</page-number>per cent, as directed by the order of the Supreme Court, that gave the plaintiff the right to maintain an action\u2014not in the Supreme Court, but in the Municipal Court\u2014upon the judgment there rendered. The remedy provided for in section 1391 of the Code of Civil Procedure is intended to be in furtherance of the collection of the judgment when money available to satisfy the same is in the hands of a third party. The action is based upon the judgment and the execution issued thereon, and, as held in the Weisel Case, any other construction would defeat the purpose of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-5\">The determination of the Appellate Term is therefore reversed, with costs, and the judgment of the Municipal Court affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
