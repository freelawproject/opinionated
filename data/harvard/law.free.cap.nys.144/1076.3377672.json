Thirteen of seventeen presses then operated by the defendant had guards over the shoe, which, if used upon the machine in question, would have prevented the injury. The absence of the guard was a proximate cause of the injury, and it is immaterial that the plaintiff was not in proximity to the machine for the special purpose of operating it, or that the shoe was practically within the frame.</p>\n<p id=\"b1103-3\">The judgment and order should be affirmed, with costs, on the authority of Welch v. Waterbury Co., 206 N. Y. 522, 100 N. E. 426; Martin v. Walker &amp; Williams Manfg. Co., 198 N. Y. 324, 91 N. E. 798; McEwen v. Borden\u2019s Condensed Milk Co., 154 App. Div. 185, 138 N. Y.
