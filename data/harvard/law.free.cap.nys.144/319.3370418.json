At that time, in the presence of plaintiff, Russell wrote, under the words \u201cto order of Bretton Hotel Company,\u201d \u201cor to George W. Sweeney,\u201d the plaintiff. On the trial, the words \u201cPay to order of Bretton Hotel Company\u201d were found to have been stricken out. The plaintiff testifies that he cannot say that they were stricken out at the time he cashed the draft, and the use of the conjunctive \u201cor\u201d in the phrase \u201cor to George W. Sweeney\u201d would certainly indicate that they had not then been stricken out. Therefore defendant\u2019s objection in his answer that the indorsee, Bretton Hotel Company, had not been joined either as plaintiff or defendant in the action, was good, on the authority of Passut v. Heubner, 81 Misc. Rep. 249, 142 N. Y. Supp. 546.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-7\">It is unnecessary to decide a further point raised by appellant, which is in substance that the change in the indorsement, if made toi the knowledge of the plaintiff, at the time the draft was cashed (negotiated) by him, prevented his being a \u201cholder in due course,\u201d and, consequently, made available as against him equities (namely, a claim of diversion of the draft) existing between the drawer and the defendant as acceptor.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-8\">Judgment reversed, and new trial granted, with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
