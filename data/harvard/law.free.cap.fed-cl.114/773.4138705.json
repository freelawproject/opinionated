(Palafox or plaintiff) and the General Services Administration (GSA, government, or defendant). <em>See </em>Compl., Dkt. No. 1, \u00b6\u00b6 1-2, 4.

Background<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b789-5\">A. The Lease and the Circumstances Giving Rise to the Dispute</p>\n<p id=\"b789-6\">On October 3, 1995, Keating and GSA entered into the Lease, under which \u201cKeating agreed to construct the federal courthouse and lease it back to GSA for a term of twenty years beginning June 1, 1997 (later amended to August 1, 1997).\u201d Compl. \u00b6 12. The Lease included a tax adjustment clause, which provided that GSA would pay real estate taxes separately from the rent. <em>See id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 6-7. The tax adjustment clause, as amended, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b789-7\">The Government shall make an annual lump sum adjustment, as additional payment to or deduction from, its share of any increase or decrease in real estate taxes that are assessed over the agreed upon base year or negotiated dollar amount____ In accordance with this paragraph, the base year- real estate taxes for purposes of adjustments are hereby established as $250,000.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b789-10\">Def.\u2019s App. A84 \u00b6 1.4, A86 \u00b6 B (the Lease); <em>see also </em>Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 7-8. In December of 1996, \u201cKeating assigned its interest under the Lease to Palafox, a special purpose entity with ownership similar to Keating.\u201d Compl. \u00b6 13. The Bank of New York was subsequently designated the trustee under the Lease. <em>See id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 14,17.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-11\">From August 1997 through December 2011, in addition to paying the monthly rent due under the Lease, GSA also paid Palafox \u201c1/12 of the negotiated $250,000 baseline amount for real estate taxes each month.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 15. In 2011, GSA conducted an audit of the rent and real estate taxes associated with the Lease. <em>See id. </em>\u00b6 17; Def.\u2019s Mot. 3. The audit revealed that the real estate taxes actually paid by Palafox each year \u201cwere substantially less than the $250,000 amount.\u201d Compl. \u00b6 17; <em>see id. </em>\u00b6 15 (conceding that, from 1997 through 2011, the annual assessed real estate taxes on the property were less than $250,000). On June 8, 2011, the contracting officer sent a letter to the Bank of New York, which stated that the discrepancy between the annual real estate taxes paid by Palafox and the annual $250,000 paid by GSA to Palafox \u201ccreated an excessive obligation due the government in the amount of $824,416.01.\u201d Def.\u2019s App. Al (June 8, 2011 letter); <em>see also </em>Compl. \u00b6 17. The contracting officer requested that the Bank of New York conduct its own analysis of the amount owed to the government and respond within thirty days. Def.\u2019s App. Al (June 8, 2011 letter). It is not clear from the record whether the Bank of New York responded to the contracting officer\u2019s June 8, 2011 letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-14\">On September 29, 2011, Keating (on behalf of Palafox) sent a letter to the contracting officer, stating its position that \u201cthe $250,000 is an allowance and that [the contracting officer\u2019s] analysis of the lease language does not reflect the matter correctly.\u201d Def.\u2019s App. A3 (Sept. 29, 2011 letter); <em>see also </em>Compl. \u00b6 19. On October 19, 2011, the contracting officer responded to the September 29, 2011 letter by e-mail. Def.\u2019s App. A4 (Oct. 19, 2011 e-mail). The contracting officer responded that GSA would likely withhold from future rental payment the amount allegedly owed to the government ($824,416.01), <em>id. </em>at A5, and, from December 1, 2011 through May 1, 2012, GSA attempted to offset the $824,416.01 by sending the Bank of New York half of the monthly rent payments, Compl. \u00b620. However, the Bank of New York refused to accept partial rent payments, the effect of which \u201cwas a setoff of six full monthly rent payments\u201d or $831,858. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 20, 25; <em>cf. </em>Def.\u2019s Mot. 4 (conceding that the $831,858 in withheld rental payments is $7,441.99 above the $824,416.01 amount identified by the contracting officer as being owed to the government).</p>\n<p id=\"b789-15\">In a letter to the contracting officer dated February 7, 2012, Palafox reiterated its disagreement with the government\u2019s position and requested that the parties meet in an \u201cattempt to resolve th[e] matter without great conflict.\u201d Def.\u2019s App. A7 (Feb. 7, 2012 letter); <em>see </em>Compl. \u00b622. On April 9, 2012, the contracting officer issued a final decision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"778\">*778</page-number>on the matter. Def.\u2019s App. A9-10 (Apr. 9, 2012 final decision); <em>see also </em>Compl. \u00b6 23. The contracting officer determined that, \u201c[b]ecause the amount of taxes paid [was] consistently less than what [was] negotiated and executed in the lease, the government [was] entitled to a reimbursement for the difference in what was paid and what is provided as part of annual and monthly rent.\u201d Def.\u2019s App. A9 (Apr. 9, 2012 final decision). The contracting officer concluded that \u201cthe excess obligation due [to] GSA is confirmed as $824,416.01.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The letter advised that \u201c[t]his [was] the final decision of the Contracting Officer,\u201d and that, pursuant to the Contract Disputes Act of 1978 (the CDA), Palafox could appeal the decision either to the Civilian Board of Contract Appeals (CBCA or Board) or the United States Court of Federal Claims (Court of Federal Claims). <em>Id. </em>at A10 (emphasis omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b790-3\">B. Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b790-4\">Palafox appealed the contracting officer\u2019s April 9, 2012 final decision to the CBCA on July 2, 2012. Compl. \u00b626; <em>see </em>Def.\u2019s App. All (CBCA Notice of Docketing). Palafox argued before the CBCA that the tax adjustment clause \u201crequire[d] GSA to pay no less than the baseline $250,000 each year for real estate taxes,\u201d and that GSA\u2019s $831,858 withholding constituted a breach of contract. Def.\u2019s App. A19-20 (CBCA Compl.). On September 7, 2012, the government filed a motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction, arguing that the CBCA lacked jurisdiction over Palafox\u2019s appeal because Palafox failed to submit a certified claim to the contracting officer for a final decision. Def.\u2019s App. A26 (Def.\u2019s CBCA Mot. to Dismiss); <em>see </em>Compl. \u00b6 27; <em>cf. </em>41 U.S.C. \u00a7 7103(b) (requiring contractors to certify claims over $100,000).</p>\n<p id=\"b790-5\">On September 11, 2012, the CBCA issued an order directing Palafox to \u201cconsider whether [its] correspondence with the contracting officer rises to the level of a claim that was ... properly certified.\u201d Def.\u2019s App. A37-38 (CBCA Sept. 11, 2012 Order); <em>see </em>Compl. \u00b6 28. The CBCA\u2019s order of September 11, 2012 further provided: \u201cIf the answer is no, [Palafox] and [the government] should jointly request to withdraw the appeal. If the answer is yes, [Palafox] should affirmatively respond to [the government\u2019s] motion.\u201d Def.\u2019s App. A38 (CBCA Sept. 11, 2012 Order). By a letter dated September 17, 2012, Palafox requested that the CBCA revise or vacate its order of September 11, 2012. Def.\u2019s App. A39 (Sept. 17, 2012 letter). Palafox argued that the CDA\u2019s certification requirements were inapplicable because Palafox had appealed a contracting officer\u2019s final decision on a <em>government </em>claim. <em>Id.; see also </em>Compl. \u00b6 28. A status conference was held on September 18, 2012, <em>see </em>Def.\u2019s App. A39 (Sept. 17, 2012 letter) (stating that a status conference was scheduled for September 18, 2012), and, on October 9, 2012, the parties filed a joint motion to dismiss without prejudice \u201cso that Palafox [could] obtain a contracting officer\u2019s final decision on its claim,\u201d Def.\u2019s App. A52 (CBCA Joint Mot. to Dismiss); <em>see also </em>Compl. \u00b6 29. The CBCA granted the parties\u2019 joint motion to dismiss on October 17,2012. Def.\u2019s App. A53 (CBCA Order of Dismissal); Compl. \u00b6 29.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-7\">On October 22, 2012, Palafox submitted a certified claim to the contracting officer in the amount of $831,858, Compl. \u00b6 30; <em>see </em>Def.\u2019s App. A54-A80 (certified claim), and the contracting officer issued a final decision denying Palafox\u2019s claim on December 20, 2012, Def.\u2019s App. A81-83 (Dec. 20, 2012 final decision); Compl. \u00b631. Palafox filed its Complaint in this court on April 8, 2013. <em>See </em>Compl. 1. Plaintiff appeals both the contracting officer\u2019s April 9, 2012 final decision (Count Four) and the contracting officer\u2019s December 20, 2012 final decision (Count Five). <em>Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 51, 56. Palafox argues, inter alia, that \u201c[t]he plain language of the Tax Adjustment clause does not provide for refunds to the GSA if the real estate taxes are less than the agreed $250,000 baseline,\u201d and that, therefore, GSA breached the Lease by setting off the rent payments. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 49- 50, 54-55; <em>cf. </em>Def.\u2019s App. A19-20 (CBCA Compl.) (arguing the same before the CBCA). Palafox seeks $831,858 plus interest in addition to other relief. Compl. 12 (Prayer for Relief).</p>\n<p id=\"b790-8\">On July 22, 2013, defendant filed its Motion, arguing that the court should dismiss Palafox\u2019s claim for $824,416.01 for lack of subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to Rule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"779\">*779</page-number>12(b)(1) of the Rules of the United States Court of Federal Claims (RCFC), and that the court should dismiss Palafox\u2019s claim for the remaining $7,441.99, and any other claims that survive defendant\u2019s Rule 12(b)(1) motion, for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6). Def.\u2019s Mot. 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-5\">With respect to defendant\u2019s Rule 12(b)(1) motion to dismiss, defendant argues that this court lacks jurisdiction over Palafox\u2019s claim for $824,416.01 because this \u201cclaim was raised before the CBCA and the CBCA had jurisdiction to consider it.\u201d Def.\u2019s Mot. 5. Under the CDA, a contractor may appeal a contracting officer\u2019s final decision in one of two fora: the appropriate board of contract appeals or the Court of Federal Claims. <em>See </em>41 U.S.C. \u00a7 7104(a)-(b)(l) (2012). A contractor is compelled to make a forum choice because the election doctrine precludes the appeal of a claim in both fora. <em>Nat\u2019l Neighbors, Inc. v. United States, </em>839 F.2d 1539, 1542 (Fed.Cir.1988). Defendant contends that Palafox made a binding election to appeal its $824,416.01 claim to the CBCA and that, therefore, the election doctrine bars this court from hearing the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-6\">With respect to defendant\u2019s Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, defendant argues that res judicata bars plaintiff\u2019s remaining claim for $7,441.99\u2014and any other claims that survive defendant\u2019s Rule 12(b)(1) motion\u2014\u201cbecause an identical ease was dismissed by the CBCA with prejudice.\u201d Def.\u2019s Mot. 1; <em>see id. </em>at 5. Under the doctrine of res judicata, \u201ca final judgment on the merits bars a second action involving the same parties and the same claim.\u201d <em>Ford-Clifton v. Dep\u2019t of Veterans Affairs, </em>661 F.3d 655, 660 (Fed.Cir.2011). Defendant contends that, in granting the parties\u2019 joint motion to dismiss, the CBCA \u201ctechnically reached a final judgment on the merits,\u201d and that, pursuant to the doctrine of res judicata, the court should therefore dismiss plaintiffs entire Complaint. Def.\u2019s Mot. 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-7\">II. Legal Standards</p>\n<p id=\"b791-8\"><em>A. </em>Rule 12(b)(1) Motion to Dismiss for Lack of Subject Matter Jurisdiction</p>\n<p id=\"b791-9\">\u201cWhen considering a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under RCFC 12(b)(1), the Court accepts as true the undisputed allegations in the complaint and draws all reasonable inferences in favor of the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Low v. United States, </em>90 Fed.Cl. 447, 450 (2009). The plaintiff bears the burden of establishing the court\u2019s jurisdiction by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>Reynolds v. Army &amp; Air Force Exch. Serv., </em>846 F.2d 746, 748 (Fed.Cir.1988); <em>Arakaki v. United States, </em>62 Fed.Cl. 244, 247 (2004). A dismissal under RCFC 12(b)(1) \u201cis warranted when, assuming the truth of all allegations, jurisdiction over the subject matter is lacking.\u201d <em>Arakaki </em>62 Fed.Cl. at 247 (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cWhen a party challenges the jurisdictional facts alleged in the complaint, the court may consider relevant evidence outside the pleadings to resolve the factual dispute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Reynolds, </em>846 F.2d at 747); <em>see </em>2 James Wm. Moore et ah, <em>Moore\u2019s Federal Practice </em>\u00b6 12.30[3] (3d ed. 2013) (\u201c[U]nlike a Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal, the court need not confine its evaluation to the face of the pleadings____\u201d). If the court determines that it does not have jurisdiction, it must dismiss the claim. RCFC 12(h)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b791-12\">The Tucker Act establishes and limits the jurisdiction of the Court of Federal Claims. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1491 (2012). The Tucker Act affords this court jurisdiction over claims \u201cagainst the United States founded either upon the Constitution, or any Act of Congress or any regulation of an executive department, or upon any express or implied contract with the United States, or for liquidated or unliquidated damages in eases not sounding in tort.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1491(a)(1). Although the Tucker Act waives the sovereign immunity necessary for a plaintiff to sue the United States for money damages, <em>United States v. Mitchell, </em>463 U.S. 206, 212, 103 S.Ct. 2961, 77 L.Ed.2d 580 (1983), it does not confer any substantive rights upon a plaintiff, <em>United States v. Testan, </em>424 U.S. 392, 398, 96 S.Ct. 948, 47 L.Ed.2d 114 (1976). A plaintiff must establish an independent substantive right to money damages from the United States\u2014that is, a money-mandating source within a contract, regulation, statute or eon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"780\">*780</page-number>stitutional provision\u2014in order for the case to proceed. <em>See Jan\u2019s Helicopter Serv., Inc. v. Fed. Aviation Admin., </em>525 F.3d 1299, 1306 (Fed.Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b792-4\">The CDA is such a money-mandating statute. The CDA confers upon this court the authority to adjudicate a claim for monetary damages arising from \u201cany express or implied contract ... made by an executive agency for ... the procurement of property, other than real property in being.\u201d 41 U.S.C. \u00a7 7102(a)(1); <em>cf. Kelley v. United States, </em>19 Cl.Ct. 155, 160 (1989) (\u201cUnder the CDA, the [Court of Federal Claims] has jurisdiction to entertain claims arising from the lease of real property____\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b792-5\">B. Rule 12(b)(6) Motion to Dismiss for Failure to State a Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b792-6\">A motion to dismiss pursuant to RCFC 12(b)(6) asserts a \u201cfailure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.\u201d RCFC 12(b)(6). To survive a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, \u201ca complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to \u2018state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ashcroft v. Iqbal (Iqbal), </em>556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009) (quoting <em>Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly (Twombly), </em>550 U.S. 544, 570, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007)).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u201cA claim has facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Twombly, </em>550 U.S. at 556, 127 S.Ct. 1955). This means that the complaint must \u201craise a right to relief above the speculative level.\u201d <em>See Twombly, </em>550 U.S. at 555, 127 S.Ct. 1955.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-7\">A complaint can also be dismissed under RCFC 12(b)(6) if it is clear from the face of the complaint that an affirmative defense exists. <em>Larson v. United States, </em>89 Fed.Cl. 363, 382 (2009), <em>aff'd, </em>376 Fed.Appx. 26 (Fed.Cir.2010). \u201cAffirmative defenses that have been considered under a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, include, among others, ... \u2018the barring effect of res judicata and related preclusion principles.\u2019\u201d <em>Corrigan v. United States, </em>82 Fed.Cl. 301, 304 (2008) (quoting 5B Charles Alan Wright &amp; Arthur R. Miller (Wright &amp; Miller), Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 1357 (3d ed.2008)). \u201cAs claim preclusion rests on a final judgment on the merits, it can quite properly and naturally be raised via a merits-based RCFC 12(b)(6) motion.\u201d <em>Chisolm v. United States, </em>82 Fed.Cl. 185, 193 (2008), <em>aff'd, </em>298 Fed. Appx. 957 (Fed.Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b792-10\">When ruling on a RCFC 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, the court \u201cmust accept as true all the factual allegations in the complaint.\u201d <em>Sommers Oil Co. v. United States (Sommers Oil), </em>241 F.3d 1375, 1378 (Fed.Cir.2001). Based on this information, the court must make \u201call reasonable inferences in favor of the non-movant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Nonetheless, \u201c[t]hreadbare recitals of the elements of a cause of action, supported by mere conclusory statements, do not suffice.\u201d <em>Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. at 678, 129 S.Ct. 1937. Further, the court is \u201cnot bound to accept as true a legal conclusion couched as a factual allegation.\u201d <em>Papasan v. Attain, </em>478 U.S. 265, 286, 106 S.Ct. 2932, 92 L.Ed.2d 209 (1986); <em>accord Twombly, </em>550 U.S. at 555, 127 S.Ct. 1955.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-11\">III. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"A3A\">A. The Election Doctrine</p>\n<p id=\"b792-12\">The CDA requires that claims by a contractor against the government \u201cshall be in writing\u201d and \u201cshall be submitted to the contracting officer for a decision.\u201d 41 U.S.C. \u00a7 7103(a)(l)-(2). The CDA also requires that claims by the government against a contractor \u201cshall be the subject of a written decision by the contracting officer.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 7103(a)(3). Although contractors must certify claims over $100,000, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 7103(b), claims by the government do not require <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"781\">*781</page-number>certification, <em>Placeway Constr. Corp. v. United States (Placeway), </em>920 F.2d 903, 906 (Fed.

Maropakis Carpentry, Inc. v. United States (M. Maropakis), </em>609 F.3d 1323, 1327 (Fed.Cir.2010). The FAR defines a \u201cclaim\u201d as \u201ca written demand or written assertion by one of the contracting parties seeking, as a matter of right, the payment of money in a sum certain.\u201d 48 C.F.R. \u00a7 52.233-l(c) (2013).

Maropakis, </em>609 F.3d at 1327.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-5\">Whether a claim is made by a contractor or the government, the CDA requires that a contracting officer issue a final decision on the claim before it can be appealed. <em>See Sharman Co. v. United States, </em>2 F.3d 1564, 1568 (Fed.Cir.1993) (\u201cUnder the CDA, a final decision by the contracting officer on a claim ... is a jurisdictional prerequisite to further legal action thereon.\u201d) (internal quotation marks omitted), <em>overruled on other grounds by Reflectone, Inc. v.

A contractor may appeal a contracting officer\u2019s final decision to either the appropriate board of contract appeals or the Court of Federal Claims. 41 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 7104(a)\u2014(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b793-6\">Pursuant to the election doctrine, once a contractor chooses the forum in which to lodge its appeal, the contractor's choice is binding, and the contractor is no longer able to pursue its appeal in the alternate forum. <em>See Nat\u2019l Neighbors, Inc., </em>839 F.2d at 1542 (\u201c[T]he binding election of forums is an \u2018either-or\u2019 alternative, and, as such, does not provide a contractor with dual avenues for contesting a contracting officer\u2019s adverse decision.\u201d). \u201cThus, if a contractor makes an informed, knowing, and voluntary decision to pursue its appeal in another forum with jurisdiction over the appeal, the Court of Federal Claims is required to dismiss a subsequently filed appeal concerning the same claim for lack of jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Bowers Inv.

The Election Doctrine Bars the Court from Hearing Plaintiffs Appeal of the Contracting Officer\u2019s April 9, 2012 Final Decision</p>\n<p id=\"b793-9\">As discussed above, Palafox appealed the contracting officer\u2019s April 9, 2012 final decision to the CBCA in July 2012, and defendant subsequently filed a motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction because Palafox had not submitted a certified claim to the contracting officer for a final decision. <em>See supra </em>Part I.B; <em>cf. </em>41 U.S.C. \u00a7 7103(b) (requiring contractors to certify claims over $100,000); <em>Thoen v.

Defendant now argues, however, that the CBCA had jurisdiction over that appeal. Def.\u2019s Mot. 7; <em>see also id. </em>(\u201cUpon further examination, we believe that our earlier motion to dismiss the CBCA case was incorrect with respect to $824,416.01____\u201d). According to defendant, because the contracting officer\u2019s April 9, 2012 final decision was \u201con a <em>Government claim,\u201d </em>Palafox was not required to certify the claim before appealing the decision to the CBCA. <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added); <em>cf.

For the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"782\">*782</page-number>reasons set forth below, the court finds that it must dismiss plaintiffs appeal of the contracting officer\u2019s April 9, 2012 final decision for want of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-4\">a. The CBCA Had Jurisdiction Over Plaintiffs Appeal of the Contracting Officer\u2019s April 9, 2012 Final Decision</p>\n<p id=\"b794-5\">Citing the decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (Federal Circuit) in <em>Placeway, </em>defendant contends that \u201c[t]he Government\u2019s retention of contract payments through setoff, when the contracting officer has determined both liability and damages in a written statement, constitutes a direetly[ ] appealable final decision on a Government claim.\u201d Def.\u2019s Reply 3 (citing <em>Placeway, </em>920 F.2d at 906-07). Plaintiff does not directly address this contention.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Instead, plaintiff makes the following arguments: (1) that the CBCA \u201cimplicitly\u2014if not explicitly\u2014dismissed the appeal because of a lack of subject matter jurisdiction,\u201d Pl.\u2019s Resp. 7, (2) that defendant is judicially es-topped from arguing that the CBCA had jurisdiction over Palafox\u2019s appeal, <em>id. </em>at 8, (3) that the CBCA \u201cnever <em>accepted </em>jurisdiction and thus Palafox never made a binding election,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 13, and (4) that Palafox\u2019s appeal to the CBCA \u201cwas not \u2018informed, knowing, and voluntary,\u201d\u2019 <em>id. </em>at 14 (emphasis and capitalization omitted). The court first addresses the substance of defendant\u2019s argument and then addresses each of plaintiffs arguments in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-6\">The court finds persuasive defendant\u2019s reliance on <em>Placeway. </em>In that case, the government withheld payment of the contract balance totaling $297,226.12 due to Place-way\u2019s alleged untimely performance under a construction contract with the government. <em>Placeway, </em>920 F.2d at 905. Placeway subsequently submitted a written demand to the contracting officer for the contract balance. <em>Id. </em>The contracting officer denied the request in a letter, stating that \u201cthe contract price balance due would not be \u2018released\u2019 because Placeway had failed to complete the contract \u2018in a timely manner.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>The contracting officer\u2019s letter did not specify the precise amount of damages to be withheld nor did it include language indicating that it represented a final decision. <em>See id. </em>at 906. Placeway filed suit in the United States Claims Court (Claims Court), the predecessor to the Court of Federal Claims, seeking, inter alia, $297,226.12 plus interest. <em>Id. </em>at 905.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-9\">The Claims Court held \u201cthat the Government had asserted a right of set off,\u201d which \u201cconstituted a government claim\u201d that did not require certification. <em>Id. </em>at 906 (internal quotation marks omitted). The Claims Court concluded, however, that it lacked jurisdiction over Plaeeway\u2019s suit because the contracting officer had not issued a final decision. <em>Id. </em>On appeal, the Federal Circuit agreed \u201cthat the set off asserted [had formed] a government claim,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 906, which the Circuit Court \u201ccharacterized as a claim seeking incidental and consequential damages for Placeway\u2019s alleged breach of contract,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 906 n. 1. But, finding that the contracting officer \u201ceffectively made a final decision on the government claim\u201d by \u201cdeelin[ing] to pay Plaeeway the balance due on the contract,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 906, the Federal Circuit vacated the Claims Court\u2019s dismissal of the claim, <em>id. </em>at 907. The Federal Circuit observed that the contracting officer\u2019s \u201cdecision ... determined] both liability and damages,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 907; <em>see id. </em>at 906 (\u201cBoth issues of liability and of damages should usually be resolved before judicial review is sought.\u201d), and noted that the contracting officer had \u201cconcluded that Placeway was liable because of delayed performance and effectively ruled that damages would be the contract balance,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 907. Because \u201ca final decision on a government claim\u201d had issued, the Federal Circuit concluded that \u201cthe Claims Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"783\">*783</page-number>ha[d] jurisdiction, even though the claim was not certified.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b795-5\">In the ease at hand, the contracting officer informed Palafox by e-mail on October 19, 2011 that he expected GSA to begin withholding $824,416.01 from future rental payments\u2014the amount for which Palafox was allegedly liable. Def.\u2019s App. A4 (Oct. 19, 2011 e-mail). And, as the contracting officer anticipated, GSA sent six partial monthly rent payments to the Bank of New York beginning on December 1, 2011. Compl. \u00b620. In a letter to the contracting officer dated February 7, 2012, Palafox voiced its disagreement with the government\u2019s position and requested that the parties meet in an \u201cattempt to resolve th[e] matter.\u201d Def.\u2019s App. A7 (Feb. 7, 2012 letter). On April 9, 2012, the contracting officer issued a final decision, finding that \u201c[b]ecause the amount of taxes paid [was] consistently less than what [was] negotiated and executed in the lease, the government [was] entitled to a reimbursement for the difference in what was paid and what is provided as part of annual and monthly rent.\u201d Def.\u2019s App. A9 (Apr. 9, 2012 final decision). The contracting officer concluded that \u201cthe excess obligation due [to the] GSA is confirmed as $824,416.01.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b795-6\">The court finds that, similar to the contract balance withheld by the government in <em>Placeway, </em>the rent withheld by GSA here constituted a government claim. <em>See Placeway, </em>920 F.2d at 906 (finding \u201cthat the set off asserted [was] a government claim\u201d). Because the contracting officer found Palafox liable for paying taxes that \u201cwere consistently less than what [was] negotiated and executed in the lease\u201d and assessed damages in the amount of $824,416.01, Def.\u2019s App. A9 (Apr. 9, 2012 final decision), the court also finds that the contracting officer\u2019s April 9, 2012 decision was a final decision that determined both liability and damages. Accordingly, the contracting officer\u2019s April 9, 2012 decision was a final decision on a government claim. The court therefore concludes that the CBCA had jurisdiction over plaintiffs appeal. <em>See Placeway, </em>920 F.2d at 906 (\u201cBecause certification is not required for government claims, the Claims Court would have jurisdiction over an appeal from a decision of a [contracting officer], provided it is final.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b795-9\">b. The CBCA Neither Explicitly Nor Implicitly Dismissed Plaintiffs Appeal for Want of Jurisdiction</p>\n<p id=\"b795-10\">Plaintiff argues that the CBCA \u201cimplicit ly\u2014if not explicitly\u2014dismissed the appeal because of a lack of subject matter jurisdiction.\u201d Pl.\u2019s Resp. 7; <em>see also id. </em>at 9 (\u201cThere is no doubt that the [CBCA] dismissed the appeal because of [a] lack of subject matter jurisdiction.\u201d). The court disagrees.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-11\">In support of its argument, plaintiff refers to the CBCA\u2019s order of September 11, 2012, in which the CBCA stated that, \u201c[b]ased on a cursory review of the appeal file,\u201d it appeared that the CBCA\u2019s decision in <em>Red Gold, Inc. v. Department of Agriculture, </em>CBCA 2259, 12-1 BCA \u00b6 34,921 (2011), applied to the facts of plaintiffs appeal.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Def.\u2019s App. A37 (CBCA Order of Sept. 11, 2012); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"784\">*784</page-number><em>cf. </em>Def.\u2019s App. A33 (Def.\u2019s CBCA Mot. to Dismiss) (arguing that the CBCA should dismiss plaintiffs appeal because, like the appellant in <em>Red Gold, </em>plaintiff failed to certify its claim to the contracting officer for a final decision). The CBCA ordered plaintiff \u201cto review <em>Red Gold </em>and then respond to [defendant\u2019s] motion [to dismiss].\u201d Def.\u2019s App. A37 (CBCA Order of Sept. 11, 2012). The CBCA suggested that, prior to filing a response, plaintiff should discuss with defendant \u201cthe jurisdictional nuances of the CDA and how it might best resolve this matter.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at A37-A38. The CBCA further advised:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b796-4\">In addressing [defendant\u2019s] motion, [plaintiff] should consider whether ... [its] claim ... was properly certified.

Plaintiff claimed that the CBCA\u2019s \u201c[o]rder accepted]\u2014without the benefit of a submission from [plaintiff]\u2014the fundamental premise of the Government\u2019s Motion [to dismiss] that the sole jurisdictional issue is whether or not [plaintiffs claim] ... was ... properly certified.\u201d Def.\u2019s App. A39 (Sept. 17, 2012 letter). Plaintiff argued that the CDA\u2019s certification requirements were inapposite \u201c[b]ecause this is a Government claim from which Palafox has appealed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at A40. Plaintiff further stated that it did not intend for the letter to constitute its response to defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss and that it \u201creserve [d] its right to respond formally to the [g]overment\u2019s [m]otion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 41; <em>see id. </em>(\u201cThe purpose of this letter is simply to provide a complete picture of the facts with regard to limited aspects of the Board\u2019s [September 11, 2012] Order ahead of the Status Conference scheduled for September 18, 2012.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b796-7\">On September 18, 2012, defendant filed a motion to abate, in which defendant \u201curge[d] the Board ... to abate th[e] Appeal until the parties have fully briefed the Board on the jurisdictional issues.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at A45-46 (Def.\u2019s CBCA Mot. to Abate); <em>see id. </em>at A47 (\u201c[Plaintiffs] arguments [in the September 17, 2012 letter] present new issues, which provide all the more reason to abate the proceedings until after the parties have fully briefed the Board and the Board rules[]on the jurisdictional issues.\u201d). Defendant also presented arguments in opposition to the arguments set forth in plaintiffs September 17, 2012 letter. <em>Id. </em>at A48-A50. The CBCA held a status conference with the parties on September 18, 2012, <em>see </em>Def.\u2019s App. A39 (Sept. 17, 2012 letter) (stating that a status conference was scheduled for September 18, 2012); Pl.\u2019s Resp. 6 (confirming that \u201c[a] status conference was held on September 18, 2012\u201d), but the details of this status conference are not known to the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-9\">On October 9, 2012, the parties filed a joint motion to dismiss without prejudice \u201cso that Palafox [could] obtain a contracting officer\u2019s final decision on its claim.\u201d Def.\u2019s App. A52 (CBCA Joint Mot. to Dismiss); <em>see </em>Pl.\u2019s Resp. 6 (stating that, \u201cbecause Palafox could not establish that there was a properly certified claim as directed by the [CBCA\u2019s] order, Palafox agreed with the Government to file a joint motion to dismiss the appeal without prejudice\u201d (emphasis omitted)). Further to the parties\u2019 joint motion to dismiss, the CBCA dismissed plaintiffs appeal <em>without </em>issuing a ruling on defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction. <em>See </em>Def.\u2019s App. A53 (CBCA Order of Dismissal) (\u201cOn October 9, 2012, the parties jointly moved to dismiss the appeal.

The court does not impute more to the CBCA\u2019s dismissal decision than was expressed. Accordingly, the court finds that the CBCA did not dismiss plaintiffs appeal for want of subject matter jurisdiction; but, rather, it was dismissed at the request of the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"785\">*785</page-number>c. The Doctrine of Judicial Estoppel Cannot Vest this Court with Subject Matter Jurisdiction</p>\n<p id=\"b797-5\">Plaintiff also posits that defendant is judicially estopped from arguing that the CBCA had jurisdiction over plaintiffs appeal because this position is inconsistent with defendant\u2019s earlier position before the CBCA. Pl.\u2019s Resp. 7; <em>cf. </em>Def.\u2019s Mot. 7 (arguing that its \u201cearlier motion to dismiss the CBCA case was incorrect\u201d). The doctrine of judicial estoppel provides that \u201c[w]here a party assumes a certain position in a legal proceeding, and succeeds in maintaining that position, he may not thereafter, simply because his interests have changed, assume a contrary position, especially if it be to the prejudice of the party who has acquiesced in the position formerly taken by him.\u201d <em>New Hampshire v.

Thus, although defendant\u2019s inconsistent positions may have affected plaintiff adversely, the doctrine of judicial estoppel cannot operate here as plaintiff urges.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-11\">d. Plaintiffs Appeal to the CBCA Was a Binding Election of Forum</p>\n<p id=\"b797-12\">Plaintiff next argues that the election doctrine does not apply because \u201cthe board never <em>accepted </em>jurisdiction,\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Pl.\u2019s Resp. 13; <em>see id. </em>(claiming that the CBCA \u201cbelieve[d] it lack[ed] subject matter jurisdiction over the appeal before it\u201d), and, therefore, \u201cthere was no binding earlier election of the board as a forum,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 14. According to plaintiff, \u201c[flor [a] motion to dismiss based on the election doctrine to be ripe for action at this Court, the board must have determined whether, as a matter of law, the board had jurisdiction over the appeal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 13 (citing <em>Nat\u2019l Neighbors, Inc., </em>839 F.2d at 1542-43); <em>see id. </em>at 14 (arguing that because the CBCA dismissed plaintiffs claim before determining whether it had jurisdiction, \u201cthe question of whether this Court should apply the election doctrine in this case will <em>never </em>\u2018ripen\u2019 \u201d). Plaintiff also contends that \u2018\u201c[t]his court may not apply the Election Doctrine to bar a suit until it is certain that a \u2018binding election\u2019 before a board of contract <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"786\">*786</page-number>appeals has occurred.\u2019 \u201d PL\u2019s Resp. 13 (quoting <em>States Roofing Corp. v.

Defendant contends that \u201c[t]he pivotal question is not whether the board affirmatively \u2018accepted\u2019 jurisdiction by denying a motion to dismiss,\u201d but, rather, \u2018\u201cwhether the board possessed jurisdiction.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Bonneville </em>As<em>socs., </em>43 F.3d at 653). According to defendant, \u201c[t]he election doctrine applies when, as here, the board possesses jurisdiction, the board does not decide any jurisdictional issues, and the appellant voluntarily withdraws its appeal and then files a complaint in this Court.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b798-5\">The court finds inapposite <em>National Neighbors </em>and <em>States Roofing, </em>the cases upon which plaintiff relies. The plaintiff in <em>National Neighbors </em>appealed a contracting officer\u2019s final decision to the applicable board of contract appeals. Before the board decided whether National Neighbors had timely filed its appeal\u2014and thus whether it possessed jurisdiction over the appeal, National Neighbors \u201cfiled a complaint in the Claims Court \u2018to protect [National Neighbors\u2019] rights in the event that the [board] determines that [National Neighbors\u2019] appeal ... was untimely filed.\u2019 \u201d <em>National Neighbors, Inc., </em>839 F.2d at 1541 (some alterations in original). The Claims Court found that the election doctrine applied and dismissed National Neighbors\u2019 complaint for lack of jurisdiction. <em>See id. </em>The Federal Circuit vacated and remanded, <em>id. </em>at 1544, holding that \u201c[t]he proceeding before the Claims Court was not ripe for [dismissal],\u201d <em>id. </em>at 1541. The Federal Circuit explained that, \u201c[f]or the proceeding before the Claims Court to be ripe for action, the board first must determine whether, as a matter of fact, National Neighbors\u2019 appeal was timely and thus whether, as a matter of law, the board had jurisdiction over National Neighbors\u2019 appeal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1543; <em>see also id. </em>(\u201cPrior to the board determining whether National Neighbors\u2019 appeal is timely and that the board has jurisdiction and can resolve the dispute, it is not possible to determine under the Election Doctrine whether National Neighbors has made a binding election to choose the board for resolution of its dispute with the contracting officer, by appealing to the board.\u201d). The Federal Circuit concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b798-8\">Because, at the time the Claims Court dismissed for lack of jurisdiction National Neighbors\u2019 complaint, the board had not determined whether it had jurisdiction over National Neighbors\u2019 appeal, we hold that the proceeding before the Claims Court was not ripe for the Claims Court to dismiss National Neighbors\u2019 complaint pursuant to the Contracts Disputes Act on grounds that National Neighbors had made a binding election under the Election Doctrine by appealing to the board the contracting officer\u2019s adverse decision.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b798-9\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b798-10\"><em>States Roofing </em>presents a similar set of factual circumstances. In that case, after appealing the final decision of a contracting officer to the applicable board of contract appeals, States Roofing filed a complaint in this court to \u201cpreserve ... any of its CDA claims over which the [board] might decline jurisdiction.\u201d <em>States Roofing Corp., </em>70 Fed.Cl. at 300. The court stated that a \u201ccontractor may file a protective suit in this court when the same claims have been presented in an appeal to a board of contract appeals and that board has not yet determined whether the appeal before it is timely.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 301 (citing, inter alia, <em>National Neighbors, Inc., </em>839 F.2d at 1543); <em>see id. </em>(stating that \u201c[t]he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"787\">*787</page-number>lesson of <em>National Neighbors </em>is that dismissal of a suit in this court because of the Election Doctrine would be premature if a board of contract appeals has not yet determined the timeliness of an appeal before that board which presents the same claims\u201d). The court held that because the board had not yet decided whether it had jurisdiction over States Roofing\u2019s appeal, \u201cdismissal of [its] complaint before this court [was] not yet ripe under the Election Doctrine.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 302; <em>see id. </em>at 300 (staying the case \u201cpending either a specific jurisdictional determination by the [board] or a ruling on the merits by the board\u201d). The timeliness issue presented in <em>National Neighbors </em>and <em>States Roofing, </em>the two cases upon which plaintiff relies, is not before this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-4\">The court considers the case relied upon by defendant, <em>Bonneville Associates, </em>more analogous to the facts of this ease. After appealing a contracting officer\u2019s final decision to the applicable board of contract appeals, the plaintiff in <em>Bonneville Associates </em>moved to withdraw the appeal, and the board dismissed the appeal without prejudice. <em>Bonneville Assocs., </em>43 F.3d at 651. Bonneville subsequently filed a complaint in this court, <em>id. </em>which the government moved to dismiss on the grounds that \u201cBonneville\u2019s filing of a notice of appeal with the board was a binding election depriving the Court of Federal Claims of jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 653. Similar to plaintiffs argument here, Bonneville argued \u201cthat the board lacked subject matter jurisdiction over its appeal and thus that Bonneville\u2019s filing of a notice of appeal with the board was not a binding election.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 652. This court concluded that the board had jurisdiction over Bonneville\u2019s appeal, and that, therefore, the election doctrine required dismissal of Bonneville\u2019s action for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. <em>Id. </em>On appeal, the Federal Circuit observed that \u201c[t]he pivotal question ... is whether the board possessed jurisdiction over Bonneville\u2019s initially filed appeal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 653. The Federal Circuit agreed with this court\u2019s analysis of the jurisdictional issue, and held that because the board had jurisdiction over Bonneville\u2019s appeal, \u201cthe Court of Federal Claims properly applied the Election Doctrine to dismiss Bonneville\u2019s action without prejudice for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 655.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-7\">Unlike in <em>National Neighbors </em>and <em>States Roofing, </em>the plaintiff in this case does not have an appeal currently pending before the CBCA Here, the appeal filed by plaintiff was dismissed by the CBCA without prejudice further to the parties\u2019 joint motion to dismiss.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>See supra </em>Part I.B. Like the board in <em>Bonneville Associates, </em>the CBCA dismissed plaintiffs appeal without making a determination as to whether it possessed jurisdiction over the appeal. See <em>supra </em>Part III.A2; Def.\u2019s Reply 7 (observing that the board in <em>Bonneville </em>\u201cdid not make any jurisdictional decisions\u201d). And, as the court did in <em>Bonneville Associates, </em>here the court examines whether the board had jurisdiction over plaintiffs appeal, and, concluding that it did, dismisses plaintiffs action for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. <em>See </em>Parts III. Al.a-e. Thus, in accordance with the Federal Circuit\u2019s guidance in <em>Bonneville Associates, </em>the court finds that plaintiffs appeal to the CBCA was a binding election and that its claim before this court is ripe for dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-8\">e. Plaintiffs Appeal to the CBCA Was \u201cInformed, Knowing, and Voluntary\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b799-9\">As a further argument, plaintiff contends that its decision to appeal to the CBCA \u201cwas not informed, knowing, and vol<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"788\">*788</page-number>untary,\u201d Pl.\u2019s Resp. 14 (capitalization, emphasis and internal quotation marks omitted), because the contracting officer\u2019s April 9, 2012 final decision \u201cmisled Palafox into believing that the decision could be appealed to the [CBCA],\u201d <em>id. </em>at 7; <em>see id. </em>at 14 (arguing that the contracting officer \u201cmisrepresented the viability and/or availability of the forums\u201d).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> As plaintiff suggests, \u201c[t]he Election Doctrine requires ... the contractor\u2019s choice of forum be informed, knowing, and voluntary.\u201d <em>Bonneville Assocs., </em>43 F.3d at 655 (internal quotation marks omitted). In addition, \u201ca true \u2018choice\u2019 of forum ... involve[s] ... an informed exercise of the contractor\u2019s right to elect between two or more alternative, coexisting, and viable remedies actually available to the contractor at the time of the election.\u201d <em>Olsberg Excavating Co. v.

In lieu of appealing to the [CBCA], you may bring an action directly to the U.S. Court of Federal Claims____\u201d Def.\u2019s App. A10 (Apr. 9, 2012 final decision). Because the contracting officer\u2019s April 9, 2012 decision was a final decision on a government claim, <em>see supra </em>Part III.A.l, plaintiff could have appealed the decision to either fora. The CBCA\u2019s order dismissing plaintiffs appeal without prejudice did not convert the CBCA into an unavailable or unviable forum. The court therefore is satisfied that plaintiffs decision to appeal to the CBCA was informed, knowing and voluntary.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-10\">Given the foregoing, the court concludes that the election doctrine bars the court from hearing plaintiffs appeal of the contracting officer\u2019s April 9, 2012 final decision. <em>See supra </em>Parts III.A. l.a-e. The court must therefore dismiss this claim for lack of jurisdiction.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>See Bowers, </em>104 Fed.Cl. at 254 (\u201c[I]f a contractor makes an informed, knowing, and voluntary decision to pursue its appeal in another forum with jurisdiction over the appeal, the Court of Federal Claims is required to dismiss a subsequently filed appeal concerning the same claim for lack of jurisdiction.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b800-11\">2.

Because the contracting officer\u2019s April 9, 2012 final decision found plaintiff liable for $824,416.01 in damages, Def.\u2019s App. A9 (Apr. 9, 2012 final decision), the additional $7,441.99 that plaintiff now seeks was not subject to the contracting officer\u2019s April 9,2012 final decision, <em>see Teller Envtl.

United States, </em>802 F.2d 1885, 1389 (Fed.Cir.1986) (\u201c[A]ll contract claims, whether by contractor against the government or vice versa, must be submitted to the contracting officer for decision.\u201d). Therefore, as defendant correctly observes, the CBCA did not have jurisdiction over plaintiffs $7,441.99 claim and the election doctrine does not bar the court from hearing this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-6\">Defendant\u2019s admission that it is unaware of any jurisdictional hurdle to plaintiffs $7,441.99 claim suggests that defendant is also unaware of any jurisdictional hurdle\u2014 whether presented by the election doctrine or otherwise\u2014to plaintiffs appeal of the contracting officer\u2019s December 20, 2012 final decision denying plaintiffs claim for $831,858. Plaintiffs appeal of the contracting officer\u2019s December 20, 2012 final decision is the only conceivable basis on which plaintiffs $7,441.99 claim could be before the court. <em>See </em>41 U.S.C. \u00a7 7104(b)(1) (providing that a contractor may appeal a contracting officer\u2019s final decision to the Court of Federal Claims); <em>cf.

If defendant is \u201cunaware of a basis to challenge the Court\u2019s jurisdiction to entertain Palafox\u2019s claim for $7,441.99,\u201d Def.\u2019s Mot. 9, then, it is possible that defendant is also unaware of a basis to challenge the court\u2019s jurisdiction to entertain plaintiffs remaining claim for $824,416.01. However, because neither party directly addresses whether the court possesses jurisdiction over plaintiffs appeal of the contracting officer\u2019s December 20, 2012 final decision, the court requests supplemental briefing on this issue. <em>See supra </em>Part IV (establishing the supplemental briefing schedule).</p>\n<p id=\"b801-8\">B. Res Judicata</p>\n<p id=\"b801-9\">The well-established legal doctrine of res judicata dictates that \u201ca final judgment on the merits bars a second action involving the same parties and the same claim.\u201d <em>Ford-Clifton, </em>661 F.3d at 660; <em>see Brown v.

McCurry, </em>449 U.S. 90, 94, 101 S.Ct. 411, 66 L.Ed.2d 308 (1980). The doctrine of res judicata is not limited to judgments issued by courts: \u201c[W]hen an administrative agency is acting in a judicial capacity and resolve[s] disputed issues of fact properly before it which the parties have had an adequate opportunity to litigate, the courts have not hesitated to apply res judicata to enforce repose.\u201d <em>United States v.

Rule 12(d) of the CBCA provides that the CBCA may \u201cdismiss the ease without prejudice to reinstatement within 180 calendar days after the date of dismissal.\u201d CBCA Rule 12(d). Rule 12(d) of the CBCA further provides that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number>\u201c[w]hen a case has been dismissed without prejudice and neither party has timely requested that the ease be reinstated, the case shall be deemed to be dismissed with prejudice on the last day such a request could have been made.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Of relevance here is the Federal Circuit\u2019s teaching that \u201c[a] dismissal with prejudice is a judgment on the merits for purposes of claim preclusion.\u201d <em>Pactiv Corp. v.

Def.\u2019s App. A53 (CBCA Order of Dismissal). Because neither party requested that the case be reinstated within 180 days, the CBCA\u2019s dismissal without prejudice was converted to a dismissal with prejudice on April 15, 2013 by operation of CBCA Rule 12(d). <em>See </em>CBCA Rule 12(d); PL\u2019s Resp. 17 (conceding that \u201cthe dismissal of the board appeal became a dismissal with prejudice by operation of passage of time\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b802-5\">Plaintiff appealed the contracting officer\u2019s December 20, 2012 final decision to this court on April 8, 2013, <em>see </em>Compl. 1, seven days before the CBCA\u2019s October 17, 2012 order of dismissal was converted to a final judgment on the merits. Thus, to the extent that this court possesses jurisdiction over the entirety of plaintifPs appeal of the contracting officer\u2019s December 20, 2012 final decision, <em>cf. supra </em>Part III.A2 (requesting additional briefing on whether the court possesses jurisdiction over plaintifPs appeal of the contracting officer\u2019s December 20, 2012 final decision denying plaintifPs claim for $831,858); Def.\u2019s Mot. 9 (claiming that it is \u201cunaware of a basis to challenge the Court\u2019s jurisdiction to entertain Palafox\u2019s claim for $7,441.99\u201d), the court finds that res judicata does not bar plaintifPs appeal of the contracting officer\u2019s December 20, 2012 final decision to this court, <em>cf. </em>Def.\u2019s Reply 11 (conceding that res judicata would not have barred plaintiff from appealing the contracting officer\u2019s December 20, 2012 final decision to the CBCA within 90 days); Def.\u2019s App. A83 (Dec. 20, 2012 final decision) (stating that plaintiff could appeal the decision to the CBCA within 90 days or the Court of Federal Claims within twelve months). Moreover, given that plaintiff filed his Complaint before the CBCA\u2019s October 17, 2012 order of dismissal was converted to a final judgment on the merits, it is not clear from the face of the Complaint at the time it was filed that res judicata, which is an affirmative defense, applies. The court therefore denies defendant\u2019s Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss on res judicata grounds. <em>See Larson, </em>89 Fed.Cl. at 382 (stating than an affirmative defense must \u201c\u2018be clearly indicated and must appear on the face of the pleading to be used as the basis for the [Rule 12(b)(6) ] motion.\u2019 \u201d (quoting Wright &amp; Miller, \u00a7 1357)); <em>Corrigan, 82 </em>Fed.Cl. at 304 (stating that res judicata is an affirmative defense for the purposes of a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss).</p>\n<p id=\"b802-7\">IV.

To the extent that plaintiff argues that the CBCA\u2019s order of September 11, 2012 was itself a decision on a jurisdictional issue, defendant correctly observes that \u201d[c]ontested jurisdictional issues must be decided by a three judge panel.\u201d Def.\u2019s Reply 3; <em>cf. </em>Def.\u2019s App. A38 (CBCA Order of Sept. 11, 2012) (signed by a single CBCA judge).

At the time of the CBCA\u2019s Order of September 11, 2012, plaintiff had not yet responded to defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss, and, therefore, the CBCA could not have reasonably concluded that defendant's dispositive motion was uncontested.

If the court lacks jurisdiction to hear plaintiff\u2019s claim for $824,416.01, <em>cf. infra </em>Part III.A.2 (requesting additional briefing on whether the court possesses jurisdiction over plaintiff\u2019s appeal of the contracting officer\u2019s December 20, 2012 final decision), then the merits of plaintiff claim may never be addressed by either the court or the CBCA\u2014notwithstanding the fact that plaintiff diligently appealed two final decisions denying the claim to both fora. However, the court\u2019s jurisdiction is limited by the language of the CDA, as interpreted by the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. <em>See, e.g., Bonneville Assocs. v. United States, </em>43 F.3d 649, 653 (1994); <em>Placeway Constr. Corp. v. United States, </em>920 F.2d 903, 906 (Fed.Cir.1990), <em>superseded by statute on other grounds, </em>Court of Federal Claims Technical and Procedural Improvements Act of 1992, Pub.L. No. 102\u2014 572, \u00a7 907(b), 106 Stat. 4506, 4519; <em>Nat'l Neighbors, Inc. v. United States, </em>839 F.2d 1539, 1542 (1988). Thus, as to plaintiff\u2019s appeal of the contracting officer\u2019s April 9, 2012 final decision, the court cannot avoid an unfair result given the limitations on the court\u2019s jurisdiction.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
