The plaintiffs in this action are two individuals and a putative class of regis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"797\">*797</page-number>tered nurses who are currently or were formerly employed by the Department of Veterans Affairs (\u201cVA\u201d). They contend that they were denied basic and overtime pay as well as compensatory time off to which they are entitled under 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7453, as well as VA regulations and policies. They seek backpay with interest, pursuant to the Back Pay Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 5596(b), as well as attorney fees and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-4\">The government argues that the Court lacks jurisdiction over Counts II, V and VI of the complaint and that Counts I, III, and IV fail to state claims on which relief may be granted. For the reasons set forth below, the government\u2019s motion to dismiss is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-5\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b809-6\">Congress created what is now the Veterans Health Administration in 1946 to \u201cto provide a complete medical and hospital service for the medical care and treatment of veterans\u201d who were then returning home after World War II. 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7301(b). <em>See Athey v. United States, </em>78 Fed.Cl. 157, 158-59 (2007); <em>Curry v. United States, </em>66 Fed.Cl. 593, 595 (2005). To staff this new service with medical professionals, Congress established a personnel system that gives the Secretary of Veterans Affairs authority over hiring and other personnel-related matters, and that is largely independent of title 5 of the United States Code, which generally governs the federal civil service. <em>See </em>38 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 7401-7474.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-7\">The plaintiffs in this case are two nurse practitioners who work for the VA, along with a putative class of registered nurses who are currently or were formerly VA employees covered by the title 38 system. They allege that during all relevant times, up to and including the present, they have been required to work additional hours in excess of the thresholds established for triggering entitlement to overtime pay in 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7453,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in order to \u201cperform[ ] patient care clinical duties and professional responsibilities known as View Alerts using VA, non-VA, or personal home computers or laptops.\u201d Compl. at \u00b6 14.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b809-12\">Plaintiffs further allege that nurse supervisors and other VA personnel with the authority to order or approve overtime work and pay had knowledge that, in order to complete View Alerts as required, the individual plaintiffs and class members worked overtime hours on a \u201crecurring and involuntary basis\u201d and that VA supervisors and other personnel \u201cexpected, required, and induced plaintiffs and other class members to work those additional hours performing View Alerts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 17. They claim that nurses who do not perform overtime work \u201cto complete a sufficient volume of View Alerts, as subjectively deemed by VA management, are subject to intensified scrutiny, management intervention, and disciplinary action for poor time management.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 18. Moreover, according to the Complaint, VA management has never offered to reduce either the volume of View Alerts or the workload in other areas of their responsibilities to enable the plaintiffs \u201cto have a workload that realistically reflects their actual work requirement and can be completed within a regularly scheduled shift.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 19. To the contrary, plaintiffs allege, the VA has increased their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"798\">*798</page-number>workloads by \u201ccontinually expanding the size of the panel of patients to which each nurse is assigned or for which each nurse is effectively responsible.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 20. Finally, plaintiffs allege that their requests for overtime pay or compensatory time off for overtime hours worked have been granted on some occasions, but denied in others, and that they have made numerous unsuccessful attempts to correct VA\u2019s practice of failing to pay them for overtime hours worked. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6\u00b6 21-24.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-4\">In Count I of their complaint, the plaintiffs allege that the VA\u2019s knowledge of the fact that they have worked overtime hours on a recurring and involuntary basis, and its \u201cexpectation, requirement, and inducement to work those additional hours constitute [the VA\u2019s] order or approval for the additional hours worked.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00b640. They further allege that VA\u2019s failure to compensate the plaintiffs for the overtime hours they have worked violates the overtime pay provisions set forth at 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7453.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Compl. at \u00b6\u00b6 41-42. In Count II, plaintiffs allege that by \u201cexpect[ing], requiring] and inducting]\u201d the plaintiffs to work overtime hours, the VA has violated the provisions of 38 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 7459(a) and (b), which prohibit the VA from requiring nursing staff to work more than forty hours in an administrative workweek or for more than eight consecutive hours (except in emergencies as provided in subsection (c) and with other exceptions not relevant here). Compl. at \u00b6\u00b6 44-51. Count III alleges that the VA\u2019s actions have violated certain agency handbooks and directives governing work schedules and overtime pay. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6\u00b6 52-67. In Count IV, plaintiffs allege that by \u201cexpecting], requiring] and inducting]\u201d the plaintiffs to work overtime hours without compensation, the VA has violated its own basic pay regulations and policies. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6\u00b6 68-74. Count V alleges that the VA has been \u201cunjustly enriched\u201d by its practice of failing to pay its nurses for overtime hours worked, and Count VI seeks recovery of backpay on a theory of quantum meruit. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6\u00b6 75-82.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b810-6\">I. Jurisdiction</p>\n<p id=\"b810-7\">The Court of Federal Claims has jurisdiction under the Tucker Act to hear \u201cany claim against the United States founded either upon the Constitution, or any Act of Congress or any regulation of an executive department, or upon any express or implied contract with the United States, or for liquidated or unliquidated damages in cases not sounding in tort.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1491(a)(1) (2006). The Tucker Act waives the sovereign immunity of the United States to allow a suit for money damages <em>(United States v. Mitchell, </em>463 U.S. 206, 215, 103 S.Ct. 2961, 77 L.Ed.2d 580 (1983)), but it does not confer any substantive rights. <em>United States v. Testan, </em>424 U.S. 392, 398, 96 S.Ct. 948, 47 L.Ed.2d 114 (1976). Therefore, a plaintiff seeking to invoke the court\u2019s Tucker Act jurisdiction must identify an independent source of a substantive right to money damages from the United States arising out of a contract, statute, regulation or constitutional provision. <em>Jan\u2019s Helicopter Serv., Inc. v. Fed. Aviation Admin., </em>525 F.3d 1299, 1306 (Fed.Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b810-8\">In this case, Counts I-IV of the complaint are based on statutory and regulatory provisions. To determine whether those statutes and regulations are \u201cmoney-mandating,\u201d the court applies a two-step test. <em>Samish Indian Nation v. United States, </em>657 F.3d 1330, 1335 (Fed.Cir.2011). First, the court determines whether any substantive law imposes specific obligations on the Government. <em>Id. </em>If that condition is met, then the court proceeds to step two, \u201cwhether the relevant source of substantive law can be fairly interpreted as mandating compensation for damages sustained as a result of a breach of the duties the governing law imposes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>United States v. Navajo Nation, </em>556 U.S. 287, 291, 129 S.Ct. 1547, 173 L.Ed.2d 429 (2009) (quotations omitted)). The Court of Federal Claims has jurisdiction under the Tucker Act \u201cif the substantive law at issue is \u2018reasonably amenable to the reading that it mandates a right of recovery in damages.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>United States v. White Moun</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"799\">*799</page-number><em>tain Apache Tribe, </em>537 U.S. 465, 473, 123 S.Ct. 1126, 155 L.Ed.2d 40 (2003)).</p>\n<p id=\"b811-5\">There is no dispute that this Court has jurisdiction over Counts I, III, and IV of the complaint, which assert claims for back-pay and other monetary relief based on alleged violations of 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7453 (the statute establishing entitlement to pay at overtime rates in specified situations) (Count I) and VA policies and procedures governing employees\u2019 entitlement to the payment of overtime and basic pay (Counts III and IV). The statutory and regulatory provisions that form the bases for these claims are clearly \u201cmoney-mandating,\u201d as they require the VA \u201cto pay employees certain amounts under certain circumstances.\u201d <em>Price v. Panetta, </em>674 F.3d 1335, 1339 (Fed.Cir.2012) (citing <em>Hall v. United States, </em>617 F.3d 1313, 1317-18 (Fed.Cir.2010) (compensation for days employee was engaged in jury service)); <em>Brodowy v. United States, </em>482 F.3d 1370, 1375-76 (Fed.Cir.2007) (statute providing additional pay to FAA employees transferring between certain positions is money mandating); <em>In re United States, </em>463 F.3d 1328, 1334 (Fed.Cir.2006) (statute fixing salary of bankruptcy judges is money mandating); <em>Bosco v. United States, </em>931 F.2d 879, 882 (Fed.Cir.1991) (\u201cprevailing rate\u201d wage statute is money mandating). This Court therefore has jurisdiction over Counts I, III, and IV under the Tucker Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-6\">On the other hand, the government contends that this Court lacks jurisdiction over the statutory claim in Count II of the complaint, which alleges a violation of 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7459. That provision states, in pertinent part, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b811-7\">Except as provided in subsection (c) [providing exceptions for specified emergency situations], the Secretary may not require nursing staff to work more than 40 hours (or 24 hours if such staff is covered under section 7456 of this title) in an administrative work week or more than eight consecutive hours (or 12 hours if such staff is covered under section 7456 or 7456A of this title).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b811-8\">38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7459(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b811-9\">As the government correctly observes, nothing on the face of this provision requires the payment of money to nursing staff where the prohibition it contains is violated. The plaintiffs argue, however, that while \u00a7 7459(a) \u201cmay not expressly provide for money damages, the statute does expressly implicate issues pertaining to overtime work, which under 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7453 must be compensated at one and one-half times a nurse\u2019s basic hourly rate of pay.\u201d Pis.\u2019 Resp. at 24. Plaintiffs also note that the Complaint alleges that nurses who have refused to work beyond the hours specified in \u00a7 7459(a) have been subjected to \u201cintensified scrutiny\u201d as well as disciplinary actions and that it can be inferred that the statute creates a right on the part of these individuals to recover damages for losses arising out of such actions. <em>Id. </em>at 24-25.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-11\">The plaintiffs\u2019 arguments are unpersuasive. The requirement that nurses be compensated at time and a half rates does not derive from \u00a7 7459; it is based on \u00a7 7453, which is, as the Court noted above, a money-mandating statute. On the other hand, there is nothing in \u00a7 7459 that suggests that the provision, in and of itself, creates a substantive right to money damages for its violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-12\">Moreover, to the extent that plaintiffs or members of the putative class have been disciplined or suffered adverse personnel actions as a result of refusing to work overtime hours as prohibited by \u00a7 7459(a), they would be asserting a right granted to them by \u00a7 7459(b)(2), which states that such a refusal may not be grounds for discrimination, dismissal or \u201cany other adverse personnel action.\u201d Such claims would be covered by the disciplinary and grievance procedures set forth at 38 U.S.C. Chapter 74, Subch. V, and would not form a basis for a claim under the Tucker Act in this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-13\">Similarly unpersuasive are the plaintiffs\u2019 arguments that this Court has jurisdiction over Counts V and VI of their complaint, which are premised on theories of unjust enrichment and \u201cquantum meruit,\u201d both of which are equitable doctrines that are based on contracts implied in law. <em>Keehn v. United States, </em>110 Fed.Cl. 306, 329-30 (2013). \u201cImplied-in-law\u201d claims are not within this Court\u2019s Tucker Act jurisdiction. <em>See, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"800\">*800</page-number><em>e.g., Lumbermens Mut. Cas. Co. v. United States, </em>654 F.3d 1305, 1316 (Fed.Cir.2011).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b812-4\">Finally, the plaintiffs cite <em>James v. Caldera, </em>159 F.3d 573, 580-81 (Fed.Cir.1998) for the proposition that Counts II, V, and VI should not be dismissed because they are \u201cincidental to and collateral of\u2019 the monetary claims in their complaint over which this Court does possess jurisdiction. Pis.\u2019 Resp. at 25-26. But contrary to plaintiffs\u2019 argument, this limited grant of authority to issue equitable orders exists \u201c[t]o provide an entire remedy and to complete the relief afforded by the judgment.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1491(a)(2). It does not provide a basis for exercising jurisdiction over separate causes of action for which no Tucker Act jurisdiction lies.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-5\">II. Failure to State a Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b812-6\">The Court turns now to the government\u2019s motion to dismiss under RCFC 12(b)(6). In ruling on a RCFC 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, the court accepts as true the complaint\u2019s undisputed factual allegations and construes them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff. <em>Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009); <em>Gould, Inc. v. United States, </em>935 F.2d 1271, 1274 (Fed.Cir.1991). While the court must draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the non-moving party, <em>Sommers Oil Co. v. United States, </em>241 F.3d 1375, 1378 (Fed.Cir.2001), the complaint\u2019s \u201c[fjactual allegations must be enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level.\u201d <em>Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 555, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007). In other words, plaintiffs\u2019 claim must be plausible on its face. <em>Id. </em>at 570, 127 S.Ct. 1955; <em>Acceptance Ins. Cos. v. United States, </em>583 F.3d 849, 853 (Fed.Cir.2009). \u201cA claim has facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the miseonduct alleged.\u201d <em>Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. at 678, 129 S.Ct. 1937 (citing <em>Twombly, </em>550 U.S. at 556, 127 S.Ct. 1955).</p>\n<p id=\"b812-9\">A. <em>Counts I and III\u2014Violation of the Overtime Provisions of 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7453 and Implementing VA Rules and Directives</em></p>\n<p id=\"b812-10\">Counts I and III of the Complaint allege that in violation of statute and its own implementing rules and directives the VA has engaged in a practice of failing and refusing to pay plaintiffs at the time and one-half rates prescribed by 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7453(e)(1) for \u201cofficially ordered or approved hours of service performed in excess of 40 hours in the administrative workweek or in excess of eight consecutive hours.\u201d Specifically, and as discussed in greater detail above, the plaintiffs allege that they were \u201cexpected, required, and induced\u201d on a \u201crecurring and involuntary basis\u201d to work overtime hours in order to meet the VA\u2019s requirement that they respond to \u201cView Alerts\u201d in a prompt and timely fashion. They allege that nurse supervisors and other VA personnel with the authority to order and approve overtime work and pay had knowledge that plaintiffs were performing this overtime work and that nurses who did not work overtime were subjected to discipline for failing to complete a sufficient volume of View Alerts.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-11\">The government contends that plaintiffs have failed to set forth facts in Counts I and III sufficient to establish their entitlement to overtime pay under 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7453(e)(1). It argues that the complaint does not allege that the plaintiffs were explicitly directed to work overtime hours and that, therefore, they have failed to allege that the overtime hours that they worked were \u201cofficially ordered or approved\u201d as required by the statute. Def.\u2019s Mot. to Dismiss at 8. Relying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"801\">*801</page-number>upon the Federal Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>Doe v. United States, </em>372 F.3d 1347 (Fed.Cir.2004), <em>cert. denied, </em>549 U.S. 1321, 127 S.Ct. 1910, 167 L.Ed.2d 565 (2007), which involved the interpretation of essentially identical statutory language contained in the Federal Employee Pay Act (FEPA), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 5542, the government argues that \u201c[t]itle 38\u2019s requirement that overtime be \u2018officially ordered or approved\u2019 requires a more formal means of authorization than contemplated by____ plaintiffs in this case.\u201d Def.\u2019s Mot. to Dismiss at 9.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b813-7\">In <em>Doe, </em>attorneys employed by the Department of Justice filed a class action suit in this Court seeking overtime compensation under FEPA That statute provides, in pertinent part, that \u201c[f]or full-time, part-time, and intermittent toms of duty, hours of work officially ordered or approved in excess of 40 hours in an administrative workweek or ... in excess of 8 hours in a day, performed by an employee are overtime work and shall be paid for ... at [the overtime rates provided by the FEPA statute].\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 5542(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b813-8\">The plaintiffs in <em>Doe, </em>like the plaintiffs here, did not allege that they had been explicitly ordered to perform their required work on an overtime basis. 54 Fed.Cl. 404, 406 (2002) (observing that \u201c[n]o authorized official directed plaintiffs to perform duties during the period before or after their eight-hour day or forty-hour week\u201d and \u201c[n]o authorized official expressly approved the performance of extra hours of work by plaintiffs\u201d). Nonetheless, relying upon a line of Court of Claims decisions that began with <em>Anderson v. United States, </em>136 Ct.Cl. 365 (1956), this Court concluded that the statutory requirement that overtime hours be \u201cofficially ordered or approved\u201d did not require such an explicit order to perform work on an overtime basis. Instead, the Court held that the requirement that overtime be \u201cofficially ordered or approved\u201d was satisfied by evidence establishing that the plaintiffs had been \u201cinduced\u201d to work overtime. <em>Doe, </em>54 Fed.Cl. at 416-17. It found such inducement based on the unrebutted evidence that DOJ attorneys were expected by managers at every level of the Justice Department to put in extra hours, that this expectation was communicated to them both verbally and through written policy statements, that their workloads could not be satisfactorily handled without working overtime hours, and that they did, in fact, work substantial amounts of overtime with the knowledge of their supervisors and high level officials at DOJ. 54 Fed.Cl. at 405.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b813-12\">In this case, the allegations in plaintiffs\u2019 complaint parallel those of the DOJ attorneys in <em>Doe. </em>Plaintiffs allege that they worked significant amounts of overtime hours responding to View Alerts, that such alerts could come at any time of the day or night, that their supervisors and other VA personnel knew that they were performing these duties on an overtime basis (and, in fact, supplied them with agency laptops so that they could work on the View Alerts at home), that nurses who did not timely respond to View Alerts were subject to intensified scrutiny and possible disciplinary action, and that\u2014in order to perform these duties\u2014 nurses were required to work overtime. These allegations\u2014if proven true\u2014would likely suffice to establish precisely the sort of \u201cinducement\u201d that this Court found sufficient to create an entitlement to overtime on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"802\">*802</page-number>part of DOJ attorneys within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 5542(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b814-4\">The key issues in this ease, therefore, are whether and to what extent this Court\u2019s conclusion in Doe\u2014that \u201cinducement\u201d to work overtime satisfies statutory language requiring that such overtime be \u201cofficially ordered or approved\u201d\u2014survived the Federal Circuit\u2019s reversal of this Court\u2019s decision on appeal and whether there is any reason to distinguish the FEPA statute from title 38. The plaintiffs argue that the court of appeals\u2019 reversal of this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Doe </em>was based entirely on the existence of a regulation promulgated by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) pursuant to FEPA, 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 550.111(c), which required that overtime be \u201cordered or approved only in writing by an officer or employee to whom this authority has been specifically delegated.\u201d Pis.\u2019 Surreply at 2. They point out that the OPM regulation does not govern here and that the VA has not promulgated a similar rule requiring that orders to work overtime be memorialized in writing by an authorized official. Pis.\u2019 Surreply at 3. They contend that <em>\u201c[b]ut fora procedural writing requirement, the [court of appeals] would not have reversed the lower court\u2019s decision that \u2018official inducement suffices to warrant compensation.\u2019 \u201d Id. </em>(citing <em>Doe, </em>372 F.3d at 1348) (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b814-5\">The government disagrees with the plaintiffs\u2019 characterization of the court of appeals\u2019 decision. It contends that\u2014in addition to concluding that OPM\u2019s regulation required that there be a written order from an authorized official\u2014the court of appeals rejected the reasoning of the <em>Anderson </em>line of eases that \u201cinducement\u201d to work overtime satisfied the statutory requirement that overtime be \u201cofficially ordered or approved.\u201d Def.\u2019s Resp. to Pis.\u2019 Surreply at 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-6\">For the reasons set forth below, the Court concludes that in light of the Federal Circuit\u2019s reasoning in <em>Doe, </em>a showing that plaintiffs were \u201cinduced\u201d to work overtime, or that they were \u201crequired\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> to do so in order to cope with their workloads, is insufficient to establish their entitlement to receive pay at overtime rates under 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7453. Instead, entitlement to overtime pay is triggered only when an authorized VA official has, either verbally or in writing, expressly directed an employee to perform specified hours of overtime outside of their regular shifts in order to meet work requirements, or where such official has approved pay at overtime rates after the fact. Because plaintiffs have not alleged that they were expressly directed to work specific overtime hours for which they were not compensated, the government\u2019s motion to dismiss Counts I and III must be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-9\">1. The Court of Appeals\u2019 Decision in <em>Doe</em></p>\n<p id=\"b814-10\">In <em>Doe, </em>the government sought reversal of this Court\u2019s decision ruling the DOJ attorneys were entitled to overtime pay under FEPA on the basis of an OPM regulation requiring that\u2014in order to be compensable at overtime rates\u2014an official with delegated authority to do so must expressly order or approve the working of overtime hours in writing. A careful reading of the court of appeals\u2019 decision reveals, however, that in reversing this Court\u2019s decision in reliance upon the OPM regulation, the court also rejected the theory of \u201cinduced\u201d overtime upon which plaintiffs rely here.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-11\">The court of appeals began by addressing the question of whether a Federal Circuit panel had the authority to modify or overrule the Court of Claims\u2019 <em>en banc </em>decision in <em>Anderson, </em>which the court characterized as: 1) having \u201cheld the writing requirement [in the OPM regulation] invalid as inconsistent with the purpose of FEPA because it added a procedural requirement that was not reflected in the statute\u201d and 2) having \u201calso suggested that equitable considerations pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"803\">*803</page-number>vented the government from denying overtime compensation where it \u2018induced\u2019 overtime work.\u201d 372 F.3d at 1354. The court of appeals concluded, in agreement with the government, that the panel did possess the authority to overrule <em>Anderson, </em>in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s intervening decision in <em>Schweiker v. Hansen, </em>450 U.S. 785, 101 S.Ct. 1468, 67 L.Ed.2d 685 (1981). <em>Doe, </em>372 F.3d at 1355.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b815-5\">The court of appeals characterized the <em>Hansen </em>decision as concluding that a writing requirement in a regulation is not invalid \u201csimply because it add[s] an additional procedural requirement to the substantive requirements of [a] statute.\u201d It concluded that this holding was \u201cdirectly at odds with the <em>Anderson </em>line of cases.\u201d <em>Doe, </em>372 F.3d at 1356. It further concluded that <em>Hansen </em>also undermined the reliance on \u201cequitable considerations\u201d that was at the heart of the <em>Anderson </em>line of eases because <em>Hansen </em>(as reinforced by <em>Office of Personnel Management v. Richmond, </em>496 U.S. 414, 110 S.Ct. 2465, 110 L.Ed.2d 387 (1990)) stood for the proposition that both statutory and regulatory requirements impose binding requirements that must be followed, notwithstanding equitable considerations. <em>Doe, </em>372 F.3d at 1356-57. It observed that \u201cin light of <em>Hansen </em>and <em>Richmond, </em>we are compelled to hold that the <em>Anderson </em>line of eases is no longer good law and that the written order requirement is not invalid on the ground that it imposes a procedural requirement that limits the right to overtime compensation under the statute or because it is inequitable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1357.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-8\">The court of appeals then turned to the question of whether the OPM regulation was entitled to deference under <em>Chevron U.S.A. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, </em>467 U.S. 837, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984). It began by asking \u201cwhether Congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue.\u201d <em>Doe, </em>372 F.3d at 1358. It concluded that the terms \u201cordered\u201d and \u201capproved\u201d are ambiguous because they \u201care broad enough to encompass either written or oral communications (or both).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1359. The court further concluded, applying <em>Chevron </em>step two, that the regulation was not unreasonable on the grounds that the addition of a writing requirement would be contrary to the statute (FEPA). <em>Id. </em>at 1360. It held that the statutory requirement that overtime work be \u201cofficially ordered or approved\u201d \u201cin and of itself is not at odds with the regulation\u2019s writing requirement, nor does it suggest that inducement is sufficient to constitute official order or approval.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b815-11\">The court of appeals explained that the statutory structure of FEPA provided support for OPM\u2019s decision to impose a formal procedure requiring an order or approval to be in writing because FEPA also contains a separate provision for pay at overtime rates when an employee is in a position \u201cin which the hours of duty cannot be controlled administratively.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 5545(c)(2)). The court also observed that the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 201-209, \u201cincorporated a different standard for overtime compensation that allowed recovery for inducement\u201d by permitting an employee to receive overtime compensation if an employer \u201csuffer[s] or permit[s]\u201d the employee to work overtime hours. <em>Id. </em>(citing 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 203(g)). That FEPA did not use similar language, the court of appeals reasoned, supported OPM\u2019s determination that a more formal means of authorization should be required. <em>Id. </em>Finally, the court observed, the writing requirement also served an important purpose of FEPA discussed in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"804\">*804</page-number>its legislative history\u2014to impose oversight mechanisms and safeguards in order to control the government\u2019s potential liability for overtime. <em>Id. </em>at 1361.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-4\">Finally, the court of appeals held that the writing requirement contained in OPM\u2019s regulations was not satisfied by the written documents referenced by the plaintiffs which included memoranda, manuals, bulletins and reports which reflected the expectation of DOJ officials that attorneys would work overtime in order to handle their caseloads. <em>Id. </em>at 1362. The majority of the documents were not written by officials who had been delegated authority to order or approve overtime (372 F.3d at 1362); further, they did not order attorneys to work any particular amount of overtime, nor did they contain an \u201cexpress directive\u201d to work overtime. <em>Id. </em>at 1363; <em>see Carlsen v. United States, </em>521 F.3d 1371, 1375 (Fed.Cir.2008) (rejecting plaintiffs\u2019 reliance upon manuals and directives requiring employees to generally follow their supervisors\u2019 insti\u2019uetions and emails directing employees to attend meetings because such documents \u201cdo not direct the performance of overtime work\u201d; because \u201cto treat such documents as written directives to perform overtime work would have the effect of converting oral directives to perform particular work into written directives to work overtime in virtually any government agency\u201d; and because \u201cnone of them directed work in general, or certain tasks in particular, to be performed outside the employees\u2019 regularly scheduled shifts\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b816-5\">2. The Application of <em>Doe </em>to this Case</p>\n<p id=\"b816-6\">As is readily apparent from a reading of <em>Doe, </em>there is nothing in that decision which mandates that an order to work overtime hours (or the approval of the working of such hours after the fact) be in writing in order for overtime to be \u201cofficially ordered or approved.\u201d To the contrary, the court\u2019s discussion of the application of <em>Chevron </em>step one to the OPM regulation implementing FEPA recognizes that the statutory terms \u201corder\u201d and \u201capprove\u201d encompass both written and oral directions. <em>Doe, </em>372 F.3d at 1359. While the court ruled that it was not unreasonable for OPM to impose a writing requirement in the exercise of its rulemaking authority, it does not follow that the statute cannot be read to permit overtime to be ordered or approved verbally. In fact, the government has acknowledged that the VA does not require an authorization to work overtime to be reduced to writing, noting that \u201curgent or emergency situations involving patient care may make such a requirement impractical.\u201d Def.\u2019s Mot. to Dismiss at 10, n.4.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b816-15\">The central question here is what effect\u2014 if <em>any\u2014Doe </em>has on the viability of plaintiffs\u2019 argument that overtime is compensable where it is \u201cinduced\u201d and not expressly ordered. With respect to that issue, plaintiffs correctly observe that title 38, unlike FEPA, does not contain a provision creating an alternative basis for entitlement to overtime pay for employees who occupy positions in which their hours cannot be controlled administratively. The court of appeals found that the existence of such a provision under FEPA supported the reasonableness of the OPM regulation establishing a more formal approval process for authorizing overtime for employees whose hours of work are subject to administrative control. <em>Doe, </em>372 F.3d at 1360.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-17\">Nonetheless, the Court finds more significant several other critical factors that led the court of appeals to reject overtime claims based on inducement under FEPA. First, and foremost, title 38, like FEPA, uses the term \u201cofficially ordered or approved\u201d; it does not employ the kind of expansive language and liberal standard contained in the FLSA (requiring payment at overtime rates where <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"805\">*805</page-number>overtime work is \u201csuffered or permitted\u201d). As the court of appeals noted (372 F.3d at 1360), the FLSA\u2019s language \u201callowed recovery for inducement,\u201d whereas the language of FEPA appears to contemplate a \u201cmore formal means of authorization.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1361.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-4\">Second, the court of appeals\u2019 rejection of the consideration of equitable factors in determining whether overtime has been \u201cofficially ordered and approved\u201d counsels in favor of a strict interpretation of the statutory language. As the court of appeals observed, <em>id. </em>at 1359, that language suggests that there must be a degree of formality to the process of ordering and approving overtime \u201cofficially.\u201d The kind of implicit approval of overtime alleged in plaintiffs\u2019 complaint does not meet that standard of formality or clarity.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-5\">The court of appeals also relied on the legislative history of FEPA and noted that an advanced written approval process would promote the necessary oversight and controls over the government\u2019s potential overtime liability. <em>Id. </em>at 1360. This same consideration, coupled with the statutory language, leads this Court to conclude that the \u201cofficially ordered and approved\u201d language of title 38 should not be read to create a liability for overtime pay based on implied directives or a standard of \u201cinducement\u201d to work overtime. Instead, what is required in order to trigger entitlement to overtime pay under 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7453(e)(1) is an express directive from an authorized VA official (whether written or verbal), ordering (or explicitly authorizing) an employee to respond to View Alerts after they have completed eight consecutive hours of work in a day or forty hours in a week.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b817-11\">In this case, the plaintiffs do not allege that they received such express directions, but rely instead upon a theory of implicit authorization or inducement. For this reason, the Court agrees that, under the reasoning of the court of appeals in <em>Doe, </em>Counts I and III of plaintiffs\u2019 complaint must be dismissed for failure to state a claim.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b817-12\">B. <em>Count IV\u2014Violations of VA\u2019s Basic Pay Regulations and Policies</em></p>\n<p id=\"b817-13\">In Count IV of their complaint, the plaintiffs allege that the VA violated its own basic pay regulations and policies by failing to compensate them at basic hourly rates of pay for the work that they performed to respond to View Alerts outside of their regularly scheduled administrative workweek. Because plaintiffs have failed to establish that these regulations provide them with an entitlement to be paid at basic rates of pay for this work, Count IV must be dismissed for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-14\">The basic rate of pay for VA employees is set pursuant to 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7404 in the form of an annual rate of pay. The plaintiffs have identified no provision in the statute that entitles employees to receive basic pay that exceeds this annual rate when they perform extra hours of work outside of their prescribed shifts. Instead, the statute provides that employees who work in excess of forty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"806\">*806</page-number>hours in an administrative workweek, or eight consecutive hours, shall be compensated at time and a half rates, but only if such work is \u201cofficially ordered or approved.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AAI\">Indeed, the plaintiffs\u2019 argument that they are entitled to be paid at \u201cbasic rates\u201d for hours of overtime worked is irreconcilable with the concept of \u201cbasic pay\u201d itself. \u201cBasic pay,\u201d by definition, does not include pay for additional hours or overtime work. <em>Nigg v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd., </em>321 F.3d 1381, 1385 (Fed.Cir.2003); <em>Mattern v. Dep\u2019t of Treasury, </em>291 F.3d 1366, 1370 (Fed.Cir.2002); <em>Triponi v. United States, </em>633 F.2d 933, 935 (Ct.Cl.1980). Accordingly, Count IV of the complaint, alleging that the VA violated its own basic pay regulations and policies by failing to compensate plaintiffs at basic pay rates for the work that they performed on View Alerts outside of their regular duty hours, fails to state a claim on which relief may be granted.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b818-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b818-7\">Based on the foregoing, the government\u2019s motion is granted, and all counts in plaintiffs\u2019 complaint are dismissed. The Clerk is directed to enter judgment accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-8\">IT IS SO ORDERED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b809-8\">. In accordance with 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7453(e)(1), \"[a] nurse performing officially ordered or approved hours of service in excess of 40 hours in an administrative workweek, or in excess of eight consecutive hours, shall receive overtime pay for each hour of such additional service. The overtime rates shall be one and one-half times such nurse's hourly rate of basic pay.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b809-9\">. According to the Complaint:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b809-10\">View Alerts are electronic, written, patient-related, and time-sensitive requests for information or follow up that are sent directly to nurses through their individually VA assigned accounts to complete. View alerts may be sent from physicians, other providers, pharmacies, laboratories, patients, and other individuals and locations from within as well as outside the VA system. View Alerts may be sent at any time and at any hour of the day or night. View Alerts are continuously sent to nurses to complete with no limit as to how many View Alerts each nurse may receive or be asked to perform. View Alerts that are not completed within two (2) weeks are automatically removed from a nurse\u2019s account. Under their professional responsibilities as patient advocates, nurses have an obligation to complete all View Alerts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b809-14\">Compl. at \u00b6 15.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b810-9\">. <em>See </em>note 1, <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b812-7\">. In their response brief (at page 26), the plaintiffs appear to recharacterize the claims in Counts V and VI as being based on breach of an implied-in-fact contract. Assuming the plaintiffs were to move to amend their complaint to assert such a claim, this Court would have Tucker Act jurisdiction to resolve it. But such an amendment would be futile as the claim would be subject to dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6) because the relationship between the government and its employees is governed by statute and regulations, not contract. <em>Hamlet v. United States, </em>63 F.3d 1097, 1101 (Fed.Cir.1995); <em>see also Chu v. United States, </em>773 F.2d 1226, 1229 (Fed.Cir. 1985) (observing that it is a \"well-established principle that, absent specific legislation, federal employees derive the benefits and emoluments of their positions from appointment rather than from any contractual or quasi-contractual relationship with the government\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b813-9\">. The government also argues that plaintiffs' own allegations reveal that overtime pay could not have been officially ordered or approved because the Complaint states that requests for overtime pay \"in order to complete additional View Alerts were denied.\u201d Def.\u2019s Mot. to Dismiss at 7 (quoting Compl. at \u00b621). This argument is circular and lacks merit. If plaintiffs were officially ordered to work overtime, they are entitled to receive pay at overtime rates; the fact that their requests for pay at overtime rates were subsequently denied would not defeat their legal entitlement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b813-15\">. The Court found that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b813-13\">Attorneys are expected to work overtime and they do so on a regular basis. They are induced to work overtime by direct supervisors, if not authorized officials as defendant would define them. The overtime that they work is well known at the highest levels of the Justice Department. The Department recognizes that it could not function properly within its budget constraints without officially induced and approved overtime work by government attorneys.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b813-14\">54 Fed.Cl. at 405.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b814-7\">. While the plaintiffs have emphasized that they are \"required\u201d to work overtime by VA, it is clear that this \u201crequirement\u201d does not arise out of any explicit order that the nurses should or must respond to View Alerts after they complete eight consecutive hours of work in a day or forty hours in a week. Instead, the \"requirement\" to which plaintiffs refer is a requirement that they perform certain work (\"promptly\u201d responding to a high volume of View Alerts). <em>See </em>Pis.\u2019 Resp. at 5, 17. It is that requirement to promptly respond, when coupled with the rest of plaintiffs' workload, which they allege \"requires\" them to respond to the View Alerts on an overtime basis.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b815-9\">. The issue in <em>Hansen </em>was whether the Social Security Administration (SSA) was estopped from enforcing a regulatory requirement that applications for Social Security benefits be in writing, where the plaintiff had been led to believe by SSA representatives that an oral application for benefits was sufficient. <em>See Doe, </em>372 F.3d at 1355 (citing <em>Hansen, </em>450 U.S. at 786, 101 S.Ct. 1468). The Court rejected the decision of the Second Circuit in that case, which had ruled for the plaintiff, holding that the court of appeals' \"distinction between [the plaintiff's] substantiv[e] eligibility] and her failure to satisfy a 'procedural requirement\u2019 does not justify estopping petitioner in this case.\u201d <em>Hansen, </em>450 U.S. at 790, 101 S.Ct. 1468 (alterations in original). It observed that \"[a] court is no more authorized to overlook the valid regulation requiring that applications be in writing than it is to overlook any other valid requirement for the receipt of benefits.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b816-12\">. The parties have cited assorted VA issuances and handbooks in their pleadings. As the court of appeals has observed, \"DVA has not issued a comprehensive set of regulations implementing the VHA personnel provisions in title 38\u201d but has instead \"set forth its interpretation of the title 38 personnel provisions in the form of manuals, directives, and handbooks.\u201d <em>James v. Von Zemenszky, </em>284 F.3d 1310, 1318-19 (Fed.Cir.2002). Unfortunately, and somewhat surprisingly, none of the cited issuances and handbooks appear to prescribe any process governing how overtime may be \"officially ordered or approved,\u201d and the Court was advised by counsel at oral argument that such a prescribed process does not exist.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b817-7\">. The Court\u2019s articulation of a general standard to govern when overtime has been \"officially ordered or approved\u201d is based solely on the statutory language, read in light of <em>Doe. </em>As explained <em>supra </em>at note 9, the VA has the authority to promulgate regulations governing entitlement to overtime pay that would provide greater specificity regarding what VA considers an \u201cofficial order\u201d to work overtime and that would identify a process by which nurses could request advance approval of such overtime.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b817-8\">. In <em>Doe, </em>the court of appeals acknowledged that there exists a \"legitimate[ ] concern! ]\" that federal agencies may be taking advantage of the \u201cofficially ordered\" language to \u201deva[de]\" legal requirements and \"in effect ... coerc[e] uncompensated overtime.\u201d 372 F.3d at 1364. This is a particularly troubling possibility in the context of title 38 nurses, for whom there exists an express statutory prohibition against the compulsion of overtime in non-emergency situations, even when the nurses will be compensated for working such overtime. 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7459. The government has suggested that individual nurses could challenge a management practice of assigning them more tasks than they can complete without working uncompensated overtime in the context of an appeal of an adverse personnel action taken against them. <em>See also Doe, </em>372 F.3d at 1364. The Court assumes that the opportunity to secure relief by provoking an adverse action that accuses them of poor performance or of shirking their duties is cold comfort to the cadre of dedicated professionals who care for our Nation\u2019s veterans. Nonetheless, the Court\u2019s conclusion that overtime pay is not available to the nurses in these circumstances is compelled by the statutory language as interpreted in <em>Doe.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b818-4\">. In their response to the government's motion to dismiss, the plaintiffs argued that the VA violated its own rules and policies by failing to schedule its nurses for overtime, notwithstanding that their work requires it.
