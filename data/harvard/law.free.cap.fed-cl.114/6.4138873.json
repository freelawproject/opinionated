Plaintiff Eco Tour Adventures, Inc. (Eco Tour) filed a pre-award bid protest complaint on August 1, 2013, and filed an amended complaint on August 8, 2013.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In this protest, Eco Tour objects to the anticipated award by the United States Department of the Interior, National Park Service (the Park Service or NPS) of two concession contracts to provide guided cross-country ski tours, including associated transportation and food services, in Grand Teton National Park. Eco Tour alleges that certain actions taken by NPS in connection with its selection of cross-country ski touring concessioners were arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law. Eco Tour seeks a permanent injunction, declaratory relief, and bid preparation costs, as well as attorney fees and costs incurred in pursuing this bid protest.</p>\n<p id=\"b23-15\">The administrative record (AR) was originally filed on August 12, 2013, and supplements to the AR were filed on September 6, 2013, and October 1, 2013.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Briefing was filed according to an expedited schedule and oral argument was held on November 8, 2013. As discussed below, the NPS violated applicable law, acted arbitrarily and capriciously, and abused its discretion in concluding that incumbent concessioners Jackson Hole Mountain Resort Corporation and The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>Hole Hiking Experience, Inc. submitted proposals that were \u201cresponsive\u201d to the requirements of the prospectus and in allowing them to match the better terms of Eco Tour\u2019s proposals for the disputed contracts. Accordingly, plaintiffs motion for judgment on the administrative record is granted, and defendant\u2019s motion for judgment on the administrative record is denied.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b24-4\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b24-5\">I. Statutory and Regulatory Framework for NPS Concession Contracts</p>\n<p id=\"b24-6\">Congress first created the NPS in 1916, authorizing the Secretary of the Interior to \u201cgrant privileges, leases, and permits for the use of land for the accommodation of visitors in the various parks, monuments, or other reservations\u201d under the Secretary\u2019s authority. Act of Aug. 25, 1916, eh. 408, Pub.L. No. 64-235, \u00a7 3, 39 Stat. 535, 535; <em>Circle Line-Statue of Liberty Ferry, Inc. v. United States, </em>76 Fed.Cl. 490, 491 (2007) <em>(Circle </em>Line). From its inception, the NPS offered financial incentives to attract concessioners to provide services in National Park locations and to induce substantial capital investments on those lands. <em>See Circle Line, </em>76 Fed.Cl. at 491; S.Rep. No. 89-765, at 7 (1965), <em>reprinted in </em>1965 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3489, 3495. These incentives included a preferential right of renewal, allowing an incumbent concessioner to renew its contract by matching the best offer of any competing bidder so long as it had performed its present contract satisfactorily. <em>See Circle Line, </em>76 Fed.Cl. at 491 (citation omitted); S.Rep. No. 89-765, at 7, 10-11.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-7\">For almost fifty years, the NPS recognized the preferential right of renewal as a matter of policy, although it did not generally write such a term within its concession contracts. <em>Circle Line, </em>76 Fed.Cl. at 491-92. In 1965, however, Congress enacted the National Park Service Concession Policies Act, Pub.L. No. 89-249, 79 Stat. 969 (the 1965 Act), in order to \u201cput into statutory form policies which, with certain exceptions, have heretofore been followed by the National Park Service in administering concessions.\u201d S.Rep. No. 89-765, at 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-12\">In November 1998, Congress revisited the issue of renewal preferences in the National Park Service Concessions Management Improvement Act of 1998, Pub.L. No. 105-391, tit. IV, 112 Stat. 3497, 3503 (the 1998 Act) (codified at 16 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5951-5966 (2012)), which repealed the 1965 Act and \u201cestablish[ed] a new and comprehensive concession management program for national parks.\u201d <em>Nat\u2019l Park Hospitality Ass\u2019n v. Dep\u2019t of the Interior, </em>538 U.S. 803, 806, 123 S.Ct. 2026, 155 L.Ed.2d 1017 (2003) (National Park Hospitality); <em>see also Circle Line, </em>76 Fed.Cl. at 492. Having found that \u201c[t]rue competition simply did not exist\u201d in the award of concession contracts, Concession Contracts, 65 Fed. Reg. 20630, 20630 (Api\\ 17, 2000), Congress restricted the right of preference set forth in the 1965 Act to apply only to (1) \u201coutfitting and guide\u201d concessioners and (2) concessioners holding contracts with annual gross receipts under $500,000, 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 5952(7)-(8); <em>Circle Line, </em>76 Fed.Cl. at 492; 65 Fed. Reg. at 20630-31.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b24-13\">Under the 1998 Act, an outfitting and guide concessioner is entitled to exercise a right of preference if each of the following requirements is satisfied:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b24-14\">(i) the contract with the outfitting and guide concessioner does not grant the concessioner any interest ... in capital improvements on lands owned by the United States within a unit of the National Park <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>System [with certain exceptions not relevant here] ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b25-5\">(ii) the Secretary determines that the concessioner has operated satisfactorily during the term of the contract (including any extension thereof); and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b25-6\">(iii) the concessioner has submitted a responsive proposal for a proposed new contract which satisfies the minimum requirements established by the Secretary pursuant to [16 U.S.C. \u00a7 5952(4) ].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b25-7\">16 U.S.C. \u00a7 5952(8)(B). In contrast, a concessioner holding a concession contract with annual gross receipts under $500,000 is entitled to exercise a right of preference if requirements (ii) and (iii) above are satisfied. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 5952(8)(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b25-8\">The 1998 Act directed the Secretary of the Interior to promulgate regulations \u201cappropriate\u201d for the implementation of the 1998 Act. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 5965. Pursuant to this statutory grant of authority, the NPS promulgated implementing regulations in April 2000. 65 Fed. Reg. 20630 (codified at 36 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 51.1-51.104 (2013)).</p>\n<p id=\"b25-9\">Under the regulations, an incumbent concessioner that is eligible to exercise a right of preference is referred to as a \u201cpreferred offeror.\u201d 36 C.F.R. \u00a7 51.27(a). A concessioner is a preferred offeror if each of the following conditions is met:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b25-10\">(a) The concessioner was a satisfactory concessioner during the term of its concession contract ...;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b25-11\">(b) The applicable new contract is a qualified concession contract ...;<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b25-12\">(c) If applicable, the concessioner\u2019s previous concession contract was an outfitter and guide concession contract____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b25-14\"><em>Id. </em>\u00a7 51.36.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-15\">Preferred offeror status does not guarantee a right of preference, however. Under the regulations, in order to exercise a right of preference and match the best offer of any competing bidder, a preferred offeror must first submit a \u201cresponsive\u201d proposal. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 51.27(b) (\u201cA right of preference is the right of a preferred offeror, <em>if it submits a responsive proposal for a qualified concession contract, </em>to match in accordance with the requirements of this part the terms and conditions of a competing proposal that the [NPS] Director has determined to be the best responsive proposal.\u201d) (emphasis added); <em>id. </em>\u00a7 51.30 (\u201cA preferred offeror must submit a responsive proposal ... if the preferred offeror wishes to exercise a right of preference.\u201d); <em>id. </em>\u00a7 51.31. A \u201cresponsive\u201d proposal is \u201ca timely submitted proposal that is determined by the Director as agreeing to all of the minimum requirements of the proposed concession contract and prospectus and as having provided the information required by the prospectus.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 51.3.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-21\">If a preferred offeror fails to submit a responsive proposal, the preferred offeror \u201cmay not exercise a right of preference\u201d and the contract \u201cwill be awarded to the offeror submitting the best responsive proposal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 51.31. If, however, the preferror offer- or submits a responsive proposal, the NPS \u201cmust advise the preferred offeror of the better terms and conditions of the best proposal and permit the preferred offeror to amend its proposal to match them.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 51.32. If a preferred offeror amends its proposal within the time period allowed by the NPS, and the NPS determines that the amended proposal matches the better terms and conditions of the best proposal, then the NPS \u201cmust select the preferred offeror for award of the contract upon the amended terms and conditions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Conversely, \u201c[i]f <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>a preferred offeror does not amend its proposal to meet the terms and conditions of the best proposal within the time period allowed by the Director, the Director will select for award of the contract the offeror that submitted the best responsive proposal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 51.33.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-4\">II. The Disputed Contracts and Eco Tour\u2019s Bid Protest</p>\n<p id=\"b26-5\">On December 20, 2012, NPS issued a prospectus, titled \u201cA Concession Business Opportunity for Guided Ski Touring Services within Grand Teton National Park,\u201d soliciting proposals for three concession contracts\u2014 GRTE024-13, GRTE025-13, and GRTE03213\u2014for the provision of guided cross-country ski touring services, including associated transportation and food services, in Grand Teton National Park. AR Tabs 4-17 (prospectus and appendices). Proposals for the contracts were to be submitted no later than March 20, 2013. AR Tab 4 at 9, 27.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-6\">The concession services solicited by the prospectus are currently being provided by incumbent concessioners Jackson Hole Mountain Resort Corporation (Jackson Hole), under contract GRTE024-03; Powder Hounds, Inc., doing business as Rendezvous Ski Tours, under contract GRTE025-03; and The Hole Hiking Experience, Inc. (Hole Hiking), under contract GRTE032-03. The NPS has \u201cdetermined [that] the three existing Concessioners are qualified contracts and, therefore the existing Concessioners are Preferred Offerors for the New Contracts.\u201d AR Tab 4 at 24; <em>see also </em>Tab 2 at 4 (concluding that \u201c[a]ll three Winter Ski Tour Contracts will be released as having preferred offeror status\u201d). The agency\u2019s determination in that regard is not in dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-7\">The prospectus included detailed instructions setting forth the protocol for submitting proposals and the selection factors to be used by the NPS to evaluate proposals. <em>See </em>AR Tab 4 at 25-31. Of particular relevance to this bid protest, the instructions state that \u201c[o]nly an Offeror submitting a responsive proposal is eligible to be awarded the new concession contract.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 27. The instruetions define a \u201cresponsive proposal\u201d as a \u201ctimely submitted proposal that is determined by the Service as agreeing to all of the minimum requirements of the draft concession contract and Prospectus and as having provided the information required by the Prospectus.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In addition, paragraph 1(d) of the instructions defines \u201cinformation required by the prospectus\u201d as \u201cinformation expressly required by the Prospectus <em>and that is material, as determined by the Service, to an effective evaluation of the proposal under the applicable selection factor.\u201d Id. </em>at 27 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b26-11\">The instructions further provide that NPS, when evaluating proposals, \u201cwill apply the principal selection factors and secondary factors as set forth in 36 C.P.R. Part 51 by assessing each timely proposal under each of the selection factors on the basis of a narrative explanation discussing any subfactors when applicable and other supporting information.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 28.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The principal and secondary selection factors set forth in the instructions are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b26-12\">Principal Selection Factor 1. The responsiveness of the proposal to the objectives, as described in the prospectus, of protecting, conserving, and preserving resources of the park area;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b26-13\">Principal Selection Factor 2. The responsiveness of the proposal to the objectives, as described in the prospectus, of providing necessary and appropriate visitor services at reasonable rates;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b26-14\">Principal Selection Factor 3. The experience and related background of the Offer- or, including the past performance and expertise of the Offeror in providing the same or similar visitor services as those to be provided under the new concession contract;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b26-15\">Principal Selection Factor 4. The financial capability of the Offeror to carry out its proposal;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b26-16\">Principal Selection Factor 5. The amount of the proposed minimum franchise fee, if any, and/or other forms of financial consideration to the Service. Consideration of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>revenue to the United States will be subordinate to the objectives of protecting, conserving, and preserving resources of the park area and of providing necessary and appropriate visitor services to the public at reasonable rates; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b27-7\">Secondary Selection Factor 1. The quality of the Offeror\u2019s proposal to conduct its operations in a manner that furthers the protection, conservation, and preservation of the park area and other resources through environmental management programs and activities, including, \u25a0without limitation, energy conservation, waste reduction, and recycling.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b27-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 29. Each proposal was to receive a \u201cscore that reflects the determined merits of the proposal under the applicable selection factor and in comparison to the other proposals received.\u201d AR Tab 4 at 28. The first four principal selection factors were to be scored from zero to five; the fifth principal selection factor was to be scored from zero to four; and the secondary selection factor was to receive a score from zero to three. <em>Id. </em>The NPS would then \u201cassign a cumulative point score to each proposal based on the assigned score for each selection factor.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 29.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-9\">The prospectus also included a proposal package explaining the minimum requirements of the disputed contracts as well as the information required by the prospectus. Part A of the proposal package sets forth the minimum requirements of the disputed contracts. <em>Id. </em>at 27,41. Although Part A states that principal selection factors 3 and 4 \u201cdo not have specific requirements,\u201d it also states that certain information \u201cis required for principal selection factors 3 and 4\u201d and that \u201c[fjailure to provide material information required thereunder may result in an offeror being deemed non-responsive.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 41.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-10\">Part B of the proposal package provides explanations for each of the selection factors, and also sets forth various subfaetors to be considered by the NPS in evaluating proposals. Of particular relevance here, the subfactors under principal selection factor 4 list the specific information <em>\u201crequired </em>\u201d by Part A of the proposal package:</p>\n<p id=\"b27-5\"><em>Subfactor 4(a). </em>Demonstrate that you have a credible, proven track record of meeting your financial obligations by providing the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b27-6\">(1) The completed Business History Information Form provided on the next page....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b27-12\">(2) Financial statements for the two most recent fiscal years in one of the following formats:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b27-13\">\u2022 NPS Concessioner Annual Financial Reports (AFR), including a current balance sheet if a balance sheet was not submitted as part of the AFR....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b27-14\">(3) A CURRENT credit report (within the last six months) in the name of the Offeror from a major credit reporting company such as Equifax, Experian, TRW or Dun &amp; Bradstreet____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b27-16\"><em>Subfactor 4(b). </em>Demonstrate that your proposal is financially viable and that you understand the financial obligations of the Draft Contract by providing the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b27-17\">(1) Please list ... the personal property (equipment) ... with monetary value over $500 that you will be using for this operation. Please note whether you currently own this equipment or not----</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b27-19\">(2) Please estimate the amount of money that you will need to begin operating the business in the format of the table below. <em>Only provide estimates for the Personal Property items (Equipment) that you need to acquire in order to begin operating. </em>Do not include items that you already own----</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b27-21\">(3) Please demonstrate that your proposal is financially feasible (that you will have a reasonable opportunity to make a profit from your business while carrying out the terms and conditions of the Draft Contract) by completing the Proforma Income Statement and Operating Assumptions____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b27-23\">\u2022 Please fully explain the assumptions on which you base your projections and detail them sufficiently so the Service can determine whether the projections are realistic____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b28-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number><em>Subfactor 4(c). </em>Demonstrate your ability to obtain the required funds for start-up costs under the Draft Contract by providing credible, compelling documentation, particularly evidence from independent sources, such as bank statements, financial statements, and signed loan commitment letters. Fully explain the financial arrangements you propose, using the following guidelines:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b28-4\">(4) Current bank statements must be provided, regardless of the funding source____ Current bank statements must be provided even if you do not anticipate significant start-up costs.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b28-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 49-54.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-8\">For contract GRTE024-13, the NPS received timely proposals from Eco Tour, Jackson Hole (the preferred offeror), and two other offerors. AR Tabs 20-21. For contract GRTE032-13, the NPS received timely proposals from Eco Tour, Hole Hiking (the preferred offeror), and two other offerors. AR Tabs 19, 22. Eco Tour did not compete for contract GRTE025-13; therefore, the only contracts in dispute are contract GRTE024-13 and contract GRTE032-13.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-9\">An evaluation panel reviewed each proposal against the five principal selection factors and one secondary selection factor, and assigned cumulative scores to each proposal. AR Tabs 23-24. Eco Tour\u2019s proposals received the highest cumulative scores for both contract GRTE024-13 and contract GRTE032-13. AR Tab 23 at 1094, Tab 24 at 1120. The evaluation panel therefore determined that Eco Tour submitted the best proposals for both contracts. AR Tabs 28-29, Tab 42 at 1272-75, 1304-07, Tab 43 at 1312-15,1344-47.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-10\">In its evaluation of Jackson Hole\u2019s and Hole Hiking\u2019s proposals, the panel found that each offeror had omitted certain financial information specified by principal selection factor 4. AR Tab 23 at 1112-16, Tab 24 at 1138-42, Tab 42 at 1273, Tab 43 at 1313. Despite these omissions, the panel nevertheless found Jackson Hole\u2019s and Hole Hiking\u2019s proposals to be \u201cresponsive to the minimum requirements of the Prospectus.\u201d AR Tab 30 at 1190, Tab 31 at 1193; <em>see also </em>AR Tab 42 at 1273-74, 1304-06, Tab 43 at 1313-14, 1344-46. Accordingly, in letters dated June 20, 2013, the NPS advised Jackson Hole and Hole Hiking that they could exercise a right of preference by agreeing to match twelve terms of Eco Tour\u2019s proposals that the evaluation panel \u201cdetermined were elements of a better offer\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b28-12\">1.

Eco Tour\u2019s amended complaint contains three counts. In Count I, Eco Tour alleges that the NPS violated applicable law, acted arbitrarily and capriciously, and abused its discretion by finding that Jackson Hole\u2019s and Hole Hiking\u2019s proposals were \u201cresponsive\u201d to the requirements of the prospectus and by allowing them to match the better terms of Eco Tour\u2019s proposals for contracts GRTE024-13 and GRTE032-13. In Count II, Eco Tour alleges that the NPS violated the Procurement Integrity Act, as amended, 41 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2101-2107 (Supp. V 2011), by disclosing to Jackson Hole and Hole Hiking information that Eco Tour had allegedly marked in its proposal as confidential. Finally, in Count III, Eco Tour alleges that the NPS violated applicable law, acted arbitrarily and capriciously, and abused its discretion when it found that Jackson Hole and Hole Hiking had matched all of the better terms of Eco Tour\u2019s proposals for contracts GRTE024-13 and GRTE032-13. With respect to all three counts, Eco Tour further asserts that the NPS\u2019s actions breached an implied contractual obligation of the government to consider bids fairly and honestly.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-10\">On August 19, 2013, the court amended the briefing schedule to allow time for the government to obtain final decisions from the source-selection authority.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The source-selection authority subsequently determined that Eco Tour, Jackson Hole, and Hole Hiking had submitted responsive proposals for the contracts at issue, that Eco Tour\u2019s proposals were the best, and that Jackson Hole and Hole Hiking had amended their proposals to match the terms of Eco Tour\u2019s best proposals. AR Tabs 42-45. On September 4, 2013, the source-selection authority determined that contracts GRTE024-13 and GRTE032-13 should be awarded to Jackson Hole and Hole Hiking, respectively.

Jurisdiction</p>\n<p id=\"b30-12\">Before proceeding to the merits of Eco Tour\u2019s bid protest, the court must address the threshold issue of jurisdiction. <em>Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better Env\u2019t, </em>523 U.S. 83, 94-95, 118 S.Ct. 1003, 140 L.Ed.2d 210 (1998) (\u201cThe requirement that jurisdiction be established as a threshold matter ... is \u2018inflexible and without exception.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Mansfield, C. &amp; L.M. Ry. Co. v. Swan, </em>111 U.S. 379, 382, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>4 S.Ct. 510, 28 L.Ed. 462 (1884))); <em>Hambsch v. United States, </em>857 F.2d 763, 765 (Fed.Cir. 1988) (\u201cWhen a court is without jurisdiction to hear a ease, it is correspondingly without authority to decide the merits of that case.\u201d) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b31-4\">Although the government does not question the court\u2019s jurisdiction to consider Eco Tour\u2019s claims, the parties dispute the source of that jurisdiction and, correspondingly, the nature of the relief the court is authorized to grant. Eco Tour seeks injunctive and declaratory relief, as well as bid preparation costs, and asserts that the court possesses jurisdiction to grant such relief pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1491(a)(1) (2006) and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1491(b)(1) (2006). <em>See </em>Am. Compl. \u00b6 1; Pl.\u2019s Mot. at 43-48. Defendant contends that \u201c[rjelief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1491(b) is unavailable because the contracts at issue are not procurements.\u201d Def.\u2019s Mot. at 28. For the reasons specified below, the court agrees with the government that section 1491(a)(1)\u2014not section 1491(b)(1)\u2014provides the jurisdictional basis for Eco Tour\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-5\">Section 1491(b)(1), which Congress added to the Tucker Act by enacting the Administrative Dispute Resolution Act of 1996 (ADRA), Pub.L. No. 104-320, see. 12, \u00a7 1491,110 Stat. 3870, 3874, grants the court \u201cjurisdiction to render judgment on an action by an interested party objecting to a solicitation by a Federal agency for bids or proposals for a proposed contract or to a proposed award or the award of a contract or any alleged violation of statute or regulation in connection with a <em>procurement or a proposed procurement.\u201d </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1491(b)(1) (emphasis added). As the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has held, \u201crelief under [section] 1491(b)(1) is unavailable outside the procurement context.\u201d <em>Res. Conservation Grp., LLC v. United States, </em>597 F.3d 1238, 1245 (Fed.Cir.2010) <em>(Resource </em>Conservation). Thus, whether the court has jurisdiction under section 1491(b)(1) depends upon whether the disputed solicitation for concessions contracts involved a \u201cprocurement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b31-15\">Section 1491(b) does not define the term \u201cprocurement.\u201d However, for purposes of determining the scope of section 1491(b), the Federal Circuit has adopted the definition of \u201cprocurement\u201d contained in 41 U.S.C. \u00a7 403(2), which has been reorganized into 41 U.S.C. \u00a7 111 (Supp. V 2011). <em>Resource Conservation, </em>597 F.3d at 1244 (citing <em>Distributed Solutions, Inc. v. United States, </em>539 F.3d 1340, 1345-46 (Fed.Cir.2008)). Section 111 provides that \u201cthe term \u2018procurement\u2019 includes all stages of the process of acquiring property or services, beginning with the process for determining a need for property or services and ending with contract completion and closeout.\u201d 41 U.S.C. \u00a7 111.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-16\">The court has previously noted the existence of \u201cconflicting authority as to whether a solicitation for concession contracts is a \u2018procurement.\u2019\u201d <em>Frazier v. United States, </em>79 Fed.Cl. 148, 160 &amp; n. 5 (2007), <em>aff'd, </em>301 Fed.Appx. 974 (Fed.Cir.2008). This court has thrice ruled that concession contracts are not procurement contracts, albeit not in the specific context of a bid protest jurisdictional challenge. <em>Terry v. United States, </em>98 Fed.Cl. 736, 737 (2011) (holding that a concession contract for the operation of a t-shirt kiosk at Fort Benning was not a procurement contract subject to the Contract Disputes Act (CDA), 41 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 7101-7109 (Supp. V 2011), because it did not involve the procurement of property or services by the government); <em>Frazier v. United States, </em>67 Fed.Cl. 56, 59 (2005) (same with respect to a concession lease for the operation of a marina on a federal reservoir), <em>aff'd, </em>186 Fed.Appx. 990 (Fed.Cir.2006); <em>YRT Servs. Corp. v. United States, </em>28 Fed.Cl. 366, 392 n. 23 (1993) <em>(YRT </em>Services) (concluding that an NPS concession contract for the provision of \u201clodging, food and gift services\u201d in Yosemite National Park \u201cdoes not constitute a procurement, but is a grant of a permit to operate a business and the government is not committing to pay out government funds or incur any monetary liability\u201d).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b32-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>In contrast to <em>YRT Services </em>and related decisions of this court, the Interior Board of Contract Appeals has consistently held that NPS concession contracts are procurement contracts subject to the CDA, <em>see, e.g., Watch Hill Concessions, Inc., </em>IBCA No. 4284-2000, 2001 WL 170911 (Feb. 16, 2001) (holding that \u201cat least in any concession contract where the concessioner is required to perform specific services or to make specific improvements to the land it occupies, as is the case here, the contract is a procurement contract, subject to the Contract Disputes Act\u201d), and the Government Accountability Office (GAO) has consistently held that concession contracts which involve the delivery of more than <em>de minimis </em>services to a federal agency are procurement contracts, <em>see, e.g., Great South Bay Marina, Inc., </em>B-296335, 2005 CPD \u00b6 135, 2005 WL 1650829, at *1 (Comp. Gen. July 13, 2005) (\u201cIt has consistently been our Office\u2019s view that a mixed transaction that includes the delivery of goods or services of more than <em>de minimis </em>value to the government is a contract for the procurement of property or services within the meaning of [the Competition in Contracting Act, 31 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3551-3556 (2006) ].\u201d (citing <em>Starfleet Marine Transp., Inc., </em>B-290181, 2002 CPD \u00b6 113, 2002 WL 1461877 (Comp. Gen. July 5, 2002))).</p>\n<p id=\"b32-6\">The court, cognizant of the somewhat conflicting authority on this issue, concludes that the greater weight of authority is to the effect that NPS concession contracts, such as those in dispute in this bid protest, are not contracts for the procurement of goods and services, and thus are not subject to the court\u2019s section 1491(b) jurisdiction. As an initial matter, the court notes that the prospectus at issue here \u201cis issued under the authority of\u2019 the regulations set forth at 36 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 51.1-51.104, which are incorporated by reference into the prospectus and control in the event of any inconsistency between the terms of the prospectus and the regulations. <em>See </em>AR Tab 4 at 27. In the regulations, the NPS has taken the position that NPS concession contracts \u201care not contracts within the meaning of [the CDA] and are not service or procurement contracts within the meaning of statutes, regulations or policies that apply only to federal service contracts or other types of federal procurement actions.\u201d 36 C.F.R. \u00a7 51.3; <em>see also National Park Hospitality, </em>538 U.S. at 806, 123 S.Ct. 2026 (quoting 36 C.F.R. \u00a7 51.3); 65 Fed.Reg. at 20635 (\u201cNPS concession contracts [under the 1998 Act] do not procure services for the government; rather, they authorize third parties to provide services to park area visitors.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b32-9\">Athough the court is not bound to accept the agency\u2019s views regarding NPS concession contracts, the agency\u2019s reasoning finds support in the language of the 1998 Act, which indicates in several places that NPS concession contracts are for the provision of goods and sendees to the public, not to the government. <em>See, e.g., </em>16 U.S.C. \u00a7 5952 (directing the Park Service to enter into concession contracts \u201cto authorize a person, corporation or other entity to provide accommodations, facilities and sendees <em>to visitors to units of the National Park System </em>\u201d) (emphasis added); <em>id. </em>\u00a7 5955 (requiring that \u201c[e]ach concessions contract shall permit the concession-er to set reasonable and appropriate rates and charges for facilities, goods, and sendees <em>provided to the public\") </em>(emphasis added). The 1998 Act also requires that \u201c[a] concessions contract shall provide for payment to the government of a franchise fee or such other monetary consideration as determined by the Secretary.\u201d 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 5956; <em>see also </em>AR Tab 4 at 24, 41, 55, 64 (prospectus stating that concessioners will be charged a \u201cfranchise fee\u201d equal to at least three percent of the concessioner\u2019s gross receipts or a flat fee of $500, whichever is greater). Thus, according to the language of the 1998 Act <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>itself, NPS concession contracts appear to be unlike traditional government procurement contracts insofar\u2019 as the government does not make payments to the contractor in exchange for the provision of goods or services to the government; instead, concessioners pay the government a fee for the privilege of charging the public for services provided to the public. <em>See YRT Services, 28 </em>Fed.Cl. at 392 n. 23. The essence of NPS concession contracts is not the acquisition of goods or services by the government, but the grant, for a fee, of certain rights to private contractors.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-5\">The agency\u2019s reasoning also finds support in the legislative history of the 1998 Act. The committee reports accompanying the 1998 Act concluded that Park Service concession contracts \u201cdo not constitute contracts for the procurement of goods and services for the benefit of the government or otherwise.\u201d S.Rep. No. 105-202, at 39 (1998); H.R.Rep. No. 105-767, at 43 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b33-6\">Additionally, it is worth noting that the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit has concluded, in the context of a challenge to 36 C.F.R. \u00a7 51.3, that NPS concession contracts are not procurement contracts subject to the CDA <em>See Amfac Resorts, L.L.C. v. Dep\u2019t of the Interior, 282 </em>F.3d 818, 835 (D.C.Cir.2002) (\u201cA procurement contract ... is a contract for which the government bargains for, and pays for, and receives goods and services. Concession contracts are not of that sort.\u201d) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted), <em>vacated on other grounds sub nom National Park Hospitality, </em>538 U.S. 803, 123 S.Ct. 2026. Although the D.C. Circuit\u2019s opinion in <em>Amfac Resorts </em>was later vacated by the United States Supreme Court on ripeness grounds, <em>see National Park Hospitality, </em>538 U.S. at 808-12, 123 S.Ct. 2026, its analysis nevertheless provides further support for the conclusion that NPS concession contracts are not procurement contracts because they do not involve the payment of money or conferral of a benefit by the government in exchange for goods and services.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-7\">The court has considered Eco Tour\u2019s arguments in support of section 1491(b) jurisdiction and finds them unpersuasive. In its reply brief, Eco Tour argues that \u201cthe contracts at issue qualify as procurements by NPS of services, through contractors, that meet NPS\u2019s statutory obligations\u201d under the 1998 Act. Pl.\u2019s Reply at 22. This <em>ipse dixit </em>argument carries no authoritative weight, and avails Eco Tour nothing. Accordingly, the court concludes that the concession contracts in dispute are not procurement contracts and, consequently, the court lacks jurisdiction under section 1491(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b33-9\">As noted, Eco Tour also alleges that defendant\u2019s actions breached an implied contractual obligation to treat offerors fairly. <em>See </em>Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 105, 115, 122; Pl.\u2019s Mot. at 40-42. This court has long had jurisdiction, under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1491(a), to hear cases and grant relief premised on the theory that when the government invites bids or solicits proposals from the public, it enters into an \u201cimplied-infaet\u201d contract to consider those bids or proposals fairly. <em>See e.g., Resource Conservation, </em>597 F.3d at 1242; <em>Impresa Construzioni Geom. Domenico Garufi v. United States, </em>238 F.3d 1324, 1331 (Fed.Cir.2001); <em>Southfork Sys., Inc. v. United States, </em>141 F.3d 1124, 1132 (Fed.Cir.1998); <em>CACI, Inc.-Federal v. United States, </em>719 F.2d 1567, 1573 (Fed.Cir.1983). The Federal Circuit recently held, in <em>Resource Conservation, </em>that this court\u2019s implied-in-faet contract jurisdiction under section 1491(a) survives, post-ADRA, for bid protests in which section 1491(b) may not provide a remedy. 597 F.3d at 1245-47. Based on this binding precedent, the court concludes that it has jurisdiction over Eco Tour\u2019s implied contract claims under section 1491(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b33-10\">II. Standards of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b33-11\">A. Judgment on the Administrative Record</p>\n<p id=\"b33-12\">Rule 52.1(c) of the Rules of the United States Court of Federal Claims (RCFC) provides for judgment on the administrative record. To review a motion or cross-motions under RCFC 52.1(c), the court asks whether, given all the disputed and undisputed facts, a party has met its burden of proof based on the evidence in the record. <em>Bannum, Inc. v. United States, </em>404 F.3d 1346, 1356-57 (Fed.Cir.2005). The court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>must make factual findings where necessary. <em>Id. </em>The resolution of RCFC 52.1(c) cross-motions is akin to an expedited trial on the paper record. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b34-4\">B. Bid Protest Review</p>\n<p id=\"b34-5\">The court first examines whether the plaintiff in a bid protest has standing to bring the suit. <em>Info. Tech. &amp; Applications Corp. v. United States, </em>316 F.3d 1312, 1319 (Fed.Cir.2003) <em>(ITAC). </em>Bid protest standing is limited to those plaintiffs who are actual or prospective bidders and whose direct economic interest would be affected by the award of the contract or by the failure to award the contract. <em>Orion Tech., Inc. v. United States, </em>704 F.3d 1344, 1348 (Fed.Cir. 2013) (citation omitted). In the circumstances of a pre-award protest where, as here, an award decision has been made but not finalized, a protester possessing a \u201csubstantial chance\u201d of winning the disputed contract has a \u201cdirect economic interest\u201d and has standing before this court. <em>Id. </em>at 1348-49.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-6\">Upon determining that a plaintiff has standing to sue, the court next considers the merits of the bid protest. A bid protest proceeds in two steps, with the trial court first determining whether the government acted without a rational basis or contrary to law, and then determining as a factual matter whether the plaintiff was prejudiced by the arbitrary or unlawful conduct. <em>Bannum, </em>404 F.3d at 1351.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-7\">The standard of review for the typical bid protest brought pursuant to section 1491(b) is whether the agency action was arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law (the APA standard). 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1491(b)(4) (incorporating the APA standard set forth in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706 (2012)); <em>Banknote Corp. of Am. v. United States, </em>365 F.3d 1345, 1350-51 (Fed. Cir.2004) (citing <em>Advanced Data Concepts, Inc. v. United States, </em>216 F.3d 1054, 1057-58 (Fed.Cir.2000)). Under the APA standard, a procurement decision may be set aside if it lacks a rational basis or if the agency\u2019s decision-making involved a clear and prejudicial violation of statute or regulation. <em>Banknote, </em>365 F.3d at 1351; <em>Emery Worldwide Airlines, Inc. v. United States, </em>264 F.3d 1071, 1085-86 (Fed.Cir.2001) (citing <em>Impresa, </em>238 F.3d at 1332-33).</p>\n<p id=\"b34-9\">The APA standard is \u201chighly deferential.\u201d <em>Advanced Data Concepts, </em>216 F.3d at 1058. Under this standard, <em>de minimis </em>errors in the procurement process do not justify relief. <em>Grumman Data Sys. Corp. v. Dalton, 88 </em>F.3d 990, 1000 (Fed.Cir. 1996) (citing <em>Andersen Consulting v. United States, </em>959 F.2d 929, 932-33, 935 (Fed.Cir. 1992)). A bid protest plaintiff bears the burden of proving that a significant error marred the procurement in question. <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>CACI Field Servs., Inc. v. United States, </em>854 F.2d 464, 466 (Fed.Cir.1988)). Examples of arbitrary and capricious agency action include \u201cwhen the agency \u2018entirely failed to consider an important aspect of the problem, offered an explanation for its decision that runs counter to the evidence before the agency, or [the decision] is so implausible that it could not be ascribed to a difference in view or the product of agency expertise.\u2019\u201d <em>Ala. Aircraft Indus., Inc.-Birmingham v. United States, </em>586 F.3d 1372, 1375 (Fed.Cir. 2009) (quoting <em>Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., </em>463 U.S. 29, 43, 103 S.Ct. 2856, 77 L.Ed.2d 443 (1983)) (alteration in original). The court will, however, \u201cuphold a decision of less than ideal clarity if the agency\u2019s path may reasonably be discerned.\u201d <em>Bowman Transp., Inc. v. Arkansas-Best Freight Sys., Inc., </em>419 U.S. 281, 286, 95 S.Ct. 438, 42 L.Ed.2d 447 (1974) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b34-10\">Similarly, to recover under the implied contract for bids to be fairly and honestly considered in a protest brought pursuant to section 1491(a), a plaintiff must establish that the agency acted arbitrarily or capriciously, or abused its discretion. <em>Southfork, </em>141 F.3d at 1132 (citing <em>Keco Indus., Inc. v. United States, </em>492 F.2d 1200, 1203 (Ct.Cl.1974) <em>(Keco II)); Distributed Solutions, Inc. v.

United States, </em>93 Fed.Cl. 687, 694 (2010) (citing <em>Keco II, </em>492 F.2d 1200). The standard of review <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>for a bid protest alleging a breach of the implied contract under section 1491(a) is, therefore, \u201cessentially the same\u201d as the APA standard applicable to protests pursued under section 1491(b). <em>FAS Support, </em>93 Fed.Cl. at 694.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-5\">\u201c \u2018If the court finds a reasonable basis for the agency\u2019s action, the court should stay its hand even though it might, as an original proposition, have reached a different conclusion as to the proper administration and application of the procurement regulations.\u2019\u201d <em>Honeywell, Inc. v. United States, </em>870 F.2d 644, 648 (Fed.Cir.1989) (quoting <em>M. Steinthal &amp; Co. v. Seamans, </em>455 F.2d 1289, 1301 (D.C.Cir.1971)). If, on the other hand, the protester has shown a significant error in the procurement process, the court must determine as a factual matter whether that error prejudiced the protester, because both error and prejudice are required for the protester to prevail. <em>Statistica, Inc. v. Christopher, </em>102 F.3d 1577, 1581 (Fed.Cir.1996) (citing <em>Data Gen. Corp. v. Johnson, </em>78 F.3d 1556, 1562 (Fed.Cir.1996)).</p>\n<p id=\"b35-6\">A bid protest plaintiff bears the burden of establishing prejudice. <em>Bannum, </em>404 F.3d at 1358. To meets its burden, a protester must show that there was a \u201csubstantial chance\u201d it would have received the contract, but for the agency\u2019s alleged error. <em>Bannum, </em>404 F.3d at 1353; <em>Alfa Laval Separation, Inc. v. United States, </em>175 F.3d 1365, 1367 (Fed.Cir.1999); <em>Data Gen. Corp., </em>78 F.3d at 1562. This \u201csubstantial chance\u201d inquiry is the same as that applied to determine a protester\u2019s standing. Thus, in this bid protest, the \u201csubstantial chance\u201d standard must be applied twice: first, to determine EeoTour\u2019s standing to bring its suit; and, second, to determine whether EcoTour suffered prejudice as a result of any adjudged errors in the procurement process. <em>See, e.g., Line Gov\u2019t Servs., LLC v. United States, </em>96 Fed.Cl. 672, 695-96 (2010) (differentiating between \u201callegational prejudice\u201d and \u201cAPA prejudice,\u201d both of which apply the \u201csubstantial chance\u201d test).</p>\n<p id=\"b35-7\">III. Standing</p>\n<p id=\"b35-8\">Although the government has not challenged Eco Tour\u2019s standing in either its motion for judgment on the administrative record or its reply brief, standing is a threshold inquiry that the court must address before considering the merits. <em>ITAC, </em>316 F.3d at 1319. As stated <em>supra, </em>bid protest standing is limited to those plaintiffs with a substantial chance of winning the contracts at issue in the protest. <em>Orion, </em>704 F.3d at 1348-49. The record demonstrates that Eco Tour submitted responsive proposals that received the highest cumulative scores of any of the proposals received by the NPS for the disputed contracts. AR Tab 23 at 1094, Tab 24 at 1120, Tabs 28-29, Tab 42 at 1272-74, Tab 43 at 1312-14. Thus, under the regulations, there is a substantial chance that Eco Tour would have been awarded the disputed contracts if not for the errors alleged in the amended complaint. <em>See </em>36 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 51.31, 51.33. Accordingly, the court concludes that Eco Tour has standing to bring its bid protest.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-9\">IV. Analysis of the Merits</p>\n<p id=\"b35-10\">Eco Tour challenges three determinations by the NPS as arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law. First, Eco Tour challenges the agency\u2019s determination that Jackson Hole and Hole Hiking submitted \u201cresponsive\u201d proposals despite their failure to include certain financial information required by the prospectus. Second, Eco Tour alleges that the Park Service violated applicable law\u2014including the Procurement Integrity Act and the implied contract to consider bids fairly and honestly\u2014by disclosing to Jackson Hole and Hole Hiking information that Eco Tour had allegedly marked in its proposal as confidential. Third, Eco Tour alleges that the NPS improperly failed to require Hole Hiking to match one of the better terms of Eco Tour\u2019s proposal for contract GRTE032-13, and therefore improperly determined that Hole Hiking had matched all of the better terms of Eco Tour\u2019s proposal for that contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>A. The Agency\u2019s \u201cResponsiveness\u201d Determination (Count I)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b36-4\">With respect to Count I, Eco Tour asserts that Jackson Hole and Hole Hiking omitted from their proposals certain financial information required by the prospectus, and that the NPS therefore erred in determining that these preferred offerors\u2019 proposals were \u201cresponsive.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> PL\u2019s Mot. at 19-37. In this regard, Eco Tour relies upon the regulations implementing the 1998 Act, which define a \u201cresponsive\u201d proposal as \u201ca timely submitted proposal that is determined by the Director as agreeing to all of the minimum requirements of the proposed concession contract and prospectus <em>and as having provided the information required by the prospectus.\u201d </em>36 C.F.R. \u00a7 51.3 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b36-5\">The court agrees with Eco Tom\u2019 that the prospectus required each offeror to submit with its proposal certain financial information to allow the NPS to evaluate the financial capability of the offeror to carry out its proposal. As noted, Part A of the proposal package stated that certain information \u201cis required for principal selection factors 3 and 4,\u201d and that \u201c[f]ailure to provide material information required thereunder may result in an offeror being deemed non-responsive.\u201d AR Tab 4 at 41. Part B of the proposal package listed the specific financial information \u201crequired\u201d by Part A <em>Id. </em>at 49-54.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-8\">The court also agrees with Eco Tour that neither Jackson Hole nor Hole Hiking submitted with their proposals all of the financial information required by the prospectus. With its proposal for contract GRTE024-13, Jackson Hole provided: (1) a business history form; (2) Annual Financial Reports (AFRs) for two previous years; (3) a chart of the equipment to be used and its value; (4) a pro forma income statement; and, (5) a chart of financial \u201coperating assumptions.\u201d AR Tab 20 at 705-23. However, Jackson Hole\u2019s proposal did not include the balance sheet or credit report required under principal selection subfactor 4(a) or bank statements required under principal selection subfaetor 4(c). AR Tab 23 at 1112, Tab 30 at 1192, Tab 42 at 1305-06.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-9\">With its proposal for contract GRTE03213, Hole Hiking provided: (1) a business history form; (2) AFRs for two previous years; (3) a balance sheet; (4) a credit report; (5) a chart of the equipment to be used and its value; (6) a pro forma income statement; (7) a chart of financial \u201coperating assumptions\u201d; and, (8) bank statements from January and February 2013. AR Tab 19 at 588-613, 615-18, 620-26. However, the Park Service found that the AFRs submitted by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>Hole Hiking were incomplete, AR Tab 24 at 1139, Tab 31 at 1195, Tab 43 at 1345-46, and noted that Hole Hiking failed to completely explain its revenue and expense projections, AR Tab 24 at 1140, Tab 31 at 1195. The Park Service also determined that the pro forma income statement submitted by Hole Hiking contained \u201cnumerous mistakes,\u201d AR Tab 24 at 1140, including \u201cmathematical errors,\u201d AR Tab 31 at 1195. Additionally, the Park Service concluded that the January and February 2013 bank statements submitted by Hole Hiking did not correspond to the reporting period of Hole Hiking\u2019s balance sheet, and therefore the Park Service was unable to ascertain whether Hole Hiking\u2019s cash position was sufficient \u201cto respond to any unanticipated expenses\u201d in light of Hole Hiking\u2019s assertion that it did not require any financing for start-up costs. AR Tab 31 at 1195. Finally, the NPS determined that Hole Hiking\u2019s balance sheet contained certain unspecified \u201canomalies,\u201d AR Tab 43 at 1346, and noted that \u201cwithout notes to explain the balance sheet, the panel was concerned with the financial position of the Offeror,\u201d AR Tab 24 at 1139.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-5\">Despite these omissions, the NPS found that Jackson Hole\u2019s and Hole Hiking\u2019s proposals were \u201cresponsive to the minimum requirements of the Prospectus\u201d because the agency determined that the omitted financial information was not material to an effective evaluation of the proposals. AR Tab 37 at 1244 (\u201cThe lack of quality and omissions [in the preferred offerors\u2019 proposals] were reflected in lower scores for the preferred offerors; however, the omissions were not significant enough to hamper an effective evaluation of the proposals.\u201d), Tab 40 at 1268 (same), Tab 42 at 1305-06 (responsiveness determination for Jackson Hole), Tab 43 at 1345-46 (responsiveness determination for Hole Hiking). In that regard, the NPS relied upon paragraph 1(d) of the prospectus instructions, which limits the meaning of the term \u201cinformation required by the prospectus\u201d to only such information as is <em>\u201cmaterial, as determined by the Service, </em>to an effective evaluation of the proposal under the applicable selection factor.\u201d AR Tab 4 at 27 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b37-6\">Eco Tour first contends that paragraph 1(d) of the prospectus instructions is contrary to the regulations insofar as it limits the definition of \u201cinformation required by the prospectus\u201d to information that is expressly required by the prospectus <em>and </em>is deemed \u201cmaterial\u201d by the NPS. Pl.\u2019s Mot. at 27-32; Pl.\u2019s Reply at 4-5. Next, Eco Tour contends that, even if the NPS were allowed to impose such a \u201cmateriality\u201d limitation, the agency acted arbitrarily and capriciously, and abused its discretion, in determining that the financial information omitted from Jackson Hole\u2019s and Hole Hiking\u2019s proposals was not material to an effective evaluation of those proposals. Pl.\u2019s Mot. at 32-37; PL\u2019s Reply at 6-10. Therefore, to resolve Eco Tour\u2019s claims with respect to Count I, the court must determine whether the NPS violated applicable law, acted arbitrarily and capriciously, or abused its discretion in determining that the financial information omitted from Jackson Hole\u2019s and Hole Hiking\u2019s proposals was not material.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-7\">1. Eco Tour\u2019s Objection to the Materiality Limitation Set Forth in Paragraph 1(d) of the Prospectus Instructions</p>\n<p id=\"b37-8\">Eco Tour first contends that the NPS acted contrary to law and abused its discretion by limiting the definition of \u201cinformation required by the prospectus\u201d to only such information that the NPS deems \u201cmaterial ... to an effective evaluation of the proposal under the applicable selection factor.\u201d PL\u2019s Mot. at 30. In that regard, Eco Tour relies upon the definition of \u201cresponsive\u201d set forth in 36 C.F.R. \u00a7 51.3, and contends that paragraph 1(d) of the prospectus instructions is \u201cdirectly contrary to the plain language of\u2019 36 C.F.R. \u00a7 51.3 insofar as the regulation \u201cdoes not include a provision that allows NPS to limit the term \u2018required\u2019 to information which NPS, in its discretion, determines is \u2018material to an effective evaluation of the proposal.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>Eco Tour also argues that paragraph 1(d) constitutes an improper \u201cexpansion] [of] the very limited exception set by Congress for when a concessioner can exercise a right of preference and evade true competition.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 31. For the reasons specified below, the court concludes that the NPS neither acted contrary to law nor abused its discretion in imposing a materiality limitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>a. Eco Tour Waived Any Objection to Paragraph 1(d)</p>\n<p id=\"b38-4\">Defendant argues that Eco Tour\u2019s contention that \u201cmateriality\u201d cannot be a factor in evaluating responsiveness is a challenge to paragraph 1(d) of the prospectus instructions, and, as such, is waived because Eco Tour failed to object to paragraph 1(d) before the deadline for the submission of proposals. <em>See </em>Def.\u2019s Mot. at 11-12 (citing <em>Blue &amp; Gold Fleet, LP v. United States, </em>492 F.3d 1308, 1313-14 (Fed.Cir.2007)). The court agrees.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-5\">It is axiomatic that \u201ca party who has the opportunity to object to the terms of a government solicitation containing a patent error and fails to do so prior to the close of the bidding process waives it ability to raise the same objection subsequently in a bid protest action in the Court of Federal Claims.\u201d <em>Blue &amp; Gold Fleet, </em>492 F.3d at 1313. Citing the desire to prevent contractors \u201cfrom taking advantage of the government and other bidders\u201d and to \u201cavoid[] costly after-the-fact litigation,\u201d the Federal Circuit, in <em>Blue &amp; Gold Fleet, </em>stated that \u201c \u2018[v]endors cannot sit on their rights to challenge what they believe is an unfair solicitation, roll the dice and see if they receive the award.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1314 (quoting <em>Argencord Mach. &amp; Equip., Inc. v. United States, </em>68 Fed.Cl. 167, 175 n. 14 (2005)); <em>see also Weeks Mame, Inc. v. United States, </em>575 F.3d 1352, 1362-63 (Fed.Cir.2009). <em>Blue and Gold Fleet </em>thus prevents a protester from raising <em>post hoc </em>objections to the terms of a solicitation. That is precisely what Eco Tour seeks to do here. Eco Tour\u2019s argument that the materiality limitation in paragraph 1(d) of the prospectus instructions conflicts with 36 C.F.R. \u00a7 51.3 is, essentially, an allegation of patent error in the prospectus. Having failed to object to the materiality limitation before the deadline for the submission of proposals, Eco Tour has waived its right to do so before this court. <em>See Blue &amp; Gold Fleet, </em>492 F.3d at 1313.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-8\">In an attempt to avoid the waiver rule announced in <em>Blue &amp; Gold Fleet, </em>Eco Tour asserts that it is not challenging the terms of the prospectus, but rather invoking the prospectus\u2019s own mechanism for resolving conflict between the terms of the prospectus and the regulations, which are incorporated by reference into the prospectus and control in the event of any inconsistency. <em>See </em>PL\u2019s Mot. at 30 n.8 (\u201c[B]ecause the terms of the Prospectus were not defective, Eco Tour was not required to challenge those terms prior to the submission of its proposal.\u201d); PL\u2019s Reply at 13. Eco Tour\u2019s argument in this regard is unpersuasive and unsupported. A patent ambiguity is \u201cpresent when the contract contains facially inconsistent provisions that would place a reasonable contractor on notice and prompt the contractor to rectify the inconsistency by inquiring of the appropriate parties.\u201d <em>Stratos Mobile Networks USA, LLC v. United States, </em>213 F.3d 1375, 1381 (Fed.Cir.2000). To the extent that there is any conflict between the prospectus instructions and the regulations incorporated by reference into the contract\u2014 insofar as the former impose a materiality limitation on the definition of \u201cinformation required by the prospectus\u201d\u2014any such conflict is a patent ambiguity regarding which Eco Tour \u201c \u2018had a duty to seek clarification from the government\u2019 \u201d before the close of bidding. <em>Blue &amp; Gold Fleet, </em>492 F.3d at 1314 (quoting <em>Stratos Mobile Networks, </em>213 F.3d at 1381). Accordingly, Eco Tour\u2019s challenge to the materiality limitation in paragraph 1(d) is waived.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b38-9\">b. The Materiality Requirement in Paragraph 1(d) Is Consistent with 36 C.F.R. \u00a7 51.3</p>\n<p id=\"b38-10\">Even assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that Eco Tour did not waive its right to challenge the materiality limitation in paragraph 1(d), its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>challenge fails for the additional reason that such a limitation is not contrary to law. As noted <em>supra, </em>36 C.F.R. \u00a7 51.3 defines a \u201cresponsive\u201d proposal as \u201ca timely submitted proposal that is determined by the Director as agreeing to all of the minimum requirements of the proposed concession contract and prospectus and as having provided the information required by the prospectus.\u201d Although section 51.3 does not expressly provide for a materiality limitation, it also does not preclude such a limitation. Indeed, by including the phrase \u201cdetermined by the Director,\u201d section 51.3 confers discretion upon the NPS to determine whether a proposal has provided the information required by the prospectus. Contrary to Eco Tour\u2019s argument, this conferral of discretion is sufficiently broad to allow the NPS to place limits on the definition of \u201cinformation required by the prospectus.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b39-5\">Neither is paragraph 1(d) in conflict with the 1998 Act. Eco Tour argues that by imposing a materiality limitation the NPS \u201cis improperly trying to expand the very limited exception set by Congress for when a concessioner can exercise a right of preference and evade true competition.\u201d Pl.\u2019s Mot. at 31. Yet, the 1998 Act provides that outfitting and guide concessioners such as Jackson Hole and Hole Hiking are entitled to exercise a preferential right of renewal if, <em>inter alia, </em>the concessioner \u201chas submitted a responsive proposal for a proposed new contract which satisfies the minimum requirements established by the Secretary pursuant to [16 U.S.C. \u00a7 5952(4)].\u201d 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 5952(8)(B)(iii).</p>\n<p id=\"b39-7\">Moreover, the materiality limitation in paragraph 1(d) is consistent with analogous precedent applying provisions of the FAR in the context of negotiated procurements. Under such precedent, \u201c \u2018a proposal that fails to conform to the <em>material </em>terms and conditions of the solicitation should be considered unacceptable and a contract award based on such an unacceptable proposal violates the procurement statutes and regulations.\u2019 \u201d <em>Allied Tech. Grp., Inc. v. United States, </em>649 F.3d 1320, 1329 (Fed.Cir.2011) (emphasis added) (quoting <em>E.W. Bliss, </em>77 F.3d at 448); <em>Furniture by Thurston v. United States, </em>103 Fed. Cl. 505, 518 (2012) (\u201cIt is blackletter law that a procuring agency may only accept an offer that conforms to the <em>material </em>terms of the solicitation.\u201d (emphasis added) (citing <em>Centech Grp., Inc. v. United States, </em>554 F.3d 1029, 1037 (Fed.Cir.2009))). Although such FAR-based cases are not directly applicable to the concession contracts at issue in this bid protest, they further undermine Eco Tour\u2019s contention that a materiality component to responsiveness is contrary to law. <em>See YRT Services, </em>28 Fed.Cl. at 414 n. 33 (\u201c[T]he language and experience represented by the FAR is helpful for reference purposes.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b39-9\">2. Was the Agency\u2019s Materiality Determination a Responsibility Determination?</p>\n<p id=\"b39-10\">The government argues that because the information omitted from Jackson Hole\u2019s and Hole Hiking\u2019s proposals related to their financial ability to carry out their proposals, the NPS\u2019s determination that these omissions were immaterial was a responsibility determination, not a responsiveness determination. Def.\u2019s Mot. at 14; Def.\u2019s Reply at 4-6. As such, defendant contends that the agency\u2019s materiality determination is \u201ceffectively unreviewable absent a claim of fraud or bad faith.\u201d Def.\u2019s Mot. at 14; Def.\u2019s Reply at 5. Inasmuch as Eco Tour has not formally alleged fraud or bad faith on the part of the NPS, the government argues that Eco Tour\u2019s challenge to the agency\u2019s responsiveness determination \u201cneed not be considered further by the Court.\u201d Def.\u2019s Mot. at 15; <em>see also </em>Def.\u2019s Reply at 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-11\">In response, Eco Tour asserts that the deference typically afforded to an affirmative determination of responsibility is inappropriate here because the NPS \u201cwas not making a threshold \u2018responsibility\u2019 determination with regard to this information, but in fact was evaluating, comparing and scoring proposals on a 0-5 point scale pursuant to Principal Selection Factor 4 and as required by the regulations.\u201d Pl.\u2019s Reply at 11; <em>see also id. </em>(\u201cThis information was not part of a \u2018yes/no\u2019 responsibility determination, it was sought as part of an effort to evaluate and score each offeror\u2019s capabilities by comparing them to the other offerors.\u201d). Eco Tour also argues <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>that \u201cin making \u2018responsibility determinations under the FAR, government agencies do not identify specific information that must be provided as NPS did here, but instead they allow bidders to provide whatever information they believe would show their \u2018responsibility\u2019 after bids are opened.\u201d PL\u2019s Reply at 12 (citing <em>John C. Grimberg Co. v. United States, </em>185 F.3d 1297, 1299 (Fed.Cir. 1999), and <em>Blount, Inc. v. United States, </em>22 Cl.Ct. 221, 226 (1990)). Here, by contrast, the prospectus requires specific financial information and the regulations governing NPS concession contracts provide very limited circumstances in which proposals may be amended or supplemented after the deadline for submitting proposals has passed. PL\u2019s Reply at 12 (citing 36 C.F.R. \u00a7 51.15(a) (allowing offerors to amend or supplement proposals after submission only if \u201crequested by the Director to do so and the Director provides all offerors that submitted proposals a similar opportunity to amend or supplement their proposals\u201d)).</p>\n<p id=\"b40-4\">The court agrees with Eco Tour that the NPS\u2019s materiality determination was not a responsibility determination. Although a determination of an offeror\u2019s financial capability is traditionally considered to pertain to the offeror\u2019s responsibility, <em>e.g., Supreme Food-service GmbH v. United States, </em>112 Fed.Cl. 402, 413 (Fed.Cl.2013) (\u201cA responsibility evaluation includes consideration of financial backing as well as the ability to meet the operational requirements of the contract ____\u201d) (citations omitted); <em>Blount, </em>22 Cl.Ct. at 227; <em>see also </em>48 C.F.R. \u00a7 9.104-1 (2012) (setting forth \u201cgeneral standards\u201d for responsibility in the procurement context, including \u201cadequate financial resources to perform the contract, or the ability to obtain them\u201d), here the offerors\u2019 financial capability is one of several evaluation factors considered under a comparative assessment of the various proposals. By contrast, a determination of responsibility is a \u201cpass/fail inquiry.\u201d <em>PlanetSpace, Inc. v. United States, </em>92 Fed.Cl. 520, 527 (2010) (citing 48 C.F.R. \u00a7 9.103); <em>see also Frontier Sys. Integrators, LLC, </em>B-298872.3, 2007 CPD \u00b6 46, 2007 WL 776887, at *5 (Comp.Gen. Feb. 28, 2007) (\u201cOur Office has long held that pass/fail evaluations of capability issues, such as past performance, are tantamount to responsibility determinations, with the result that a rating of \u2018unacceptable\u2019 in these areas is the same as a determination of nonresponsibility.\u201d (citing <em>Phil Howry Co., </em>B-291402.4, 2003 CPD \u00b6 33, 2003 WL 282206 (Comp. Gen. Feb. 6, 2003))). A consideration of responsibility-related factors, such as financial capability, in the context of a comparative assessment of proposals does not constitute a responsibility determination. <em>See, e.g., PlanetSpace, </em>92 Fed.Cl. at 546 (\u201cStanding apart from the responsibility determination, however, procuring agencies may, in the context of a comparative evaluation of proposals, use traditional responsibility criteria, such as considering an offeror\u2019s financial resources and past performance.\u201d (citing <em>Delta Data Sys. Corp. v. Webster, </em>744 F.2d 197, 203 (D.C.Cir.1984), and <em>YRT Services, </em>28 Fed.Cl. at 394-95)); <em>YRT Services, </em>28 Fed.Cl. at 394-95 (\u201c\u2018Agencies commonly use responsibility related factors in the evaluation process, notwithstanding the fact that a responsibility determination must ultimately be made____ This process does not constitute a responsibility determination----\u2019\u201d (quoting John Cibinic, Jr. and Ralph C. Nash, Jr., <em>Formation of Government Contracts </em>547 (2d ed. 1986))).</p>\n<p id=\"b40-11\">The court has considered the government\u2019s arguments to the contrary and finds them unpersuasive. Defendant cites several cases in support of its argument that the NPS\u2019s materiality determination was a responsibility determination that is \u201ceffectively unreviewable absent a claim of fraud or bad faith.\u201d Def.\u2019s Mot. at 14-15; Def.\u2019s Reply at 4-6 (citing <em>John C.

United States, </em>46 Fed.Cl. 740, 746 (2000), and <em>Blount, </em>22 Cl.Ct. at 227). However, none of these cases involved an assessment of responsibility-related factors, such as financial capability, in the context of a comparative assessment of proposals. Rather, each involved a \u201cpass/ fail\u201d determination of responsibility <em>(i.e., </em>was the offeror responsible or not?). According<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>ly, defendant\u2019s ease law is inapposite.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b41-5\">Additionally, in its reply brief, defendant appears to argue that the NPS\u2019s materiality determination constitutes a responsibility determination because it was a \u201cyes/no\u201d determination <em>(i.e., </em>were the omissions material or not?). Def.\u2019s Reply at 6 (\u201cWhat Eco Tour does contest is NPS\u2019s separate \u2018yes/no\u2019 determination that the responses to [principal selection factor] 4 were \u2018material,\u2019 and therefore responsive____ These are responsibility determinations.\u201d). But both responsiveness and responsibility are \u201cyes/no\u201d inquiries. Thus, the \u201cyes/no\u201d character of the agency\u2019s materiality determination does nothing to transform it from a responsiveness determination to a responsibility determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-7\">For these reasons, the court rejects defendant\u2019s attempt to characterize the NPS\u2019s materiality determination as one of responsibility, which the court would normally afford heightened deference. Accordingly, the court will address whether the agency\u2019s materiality determination was arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-8\">3.

Jackson Hole\u2019s and Hole Hiking\u2019s Failure to Provide Current Bank Statements (Principal Selection Sub-factor 4(c))</p>\n<p id=\"b41-10\">The NPS determined that neither Jackson Hole nor Hole Hiking submitted current bank statements demonstrating their ability to obtain funds for start-up costs as required under principal selection subfactor 4(c). AR Tab 23 at 1115, Tab 30 at 1192, Tab 31 at 1195, Tab 42 at 1305-06. The NPS nevertheless found these omissions to be immaterial because both Jackson Hole and Hole Hiking indicated in their proposals that, as incumbent concessioners, they had no start-up costs. With respect to Jackson Hole, the agency stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-12\">[Principal selection subfactor 4(c) ] requests that the Offeror demonstrate its ability to obtain the required funds for any start-up costs under the new Contract. It also requests the Offeror to provide a bank statement. Jackson Hole responded that [principal selection subfaetor 4(e) ] is not applicable because Jackson Hole is already operating as the current concessioner. Jackson Hole did not provide a bank statement. The Panel concluded that Jackson Hole\u2019s status as the incumbent concession-er supported Jackson Hole\u2019s assertion that it had no start-up costs. Thus, Jackson Hole did not need to demonstrate funding to support such costs, and provided a material response.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b41-13\">AR Tab 42 at 1306; <em>see also </em>AR Tab 20 at 664-65 (Jackson Hole\u2019s proposal stating that the requirements in the prospectus to identify property to be acquired and the source of funding for start-up costs were \u201cnot applicable\u201d). Similarly, with respect to Hole Hiking, the NPS stated that \u201cHole Hiking responded in [principal selection subfactor 4(b)] that it would not have any start-up expenses and the response in [principal selection subfaetor 4(c) ] supported this assertion.\u201d AR Tab 43 at 1346; <em>see also </em>AR Tab 19 at 614, 619 (Hole Hiking\u2019s proposal stating that it would have no start-up costs).</p>\n<p id=\"b41-14\">Eco Tour argues that the NPS erroneously accepted Jackson Hole\u2019s and Hole Hiking\u2019s representations that they had no start-up costs. Pl.\u2019s Mot. at 24-25, 36-37; PL\u2019s Reply at 7-8. In that regard, Eco Tour notes that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>Jackson Hole stated, on a chart listing the equipment to be used by Jackson Hole in carrying out contract GRTE024-13, that it \u201canticipated\u201d purchasing a [] and [] \u201cfor Season 2014.\u201d AR Tab 20 at 720. Eco Tour further notes that Hole Hiking stated, in the portion of its proposal related to principal selection subfactor 2(a), that \u201c[a]t the beginning of the year, we order new [ ] and [ ].\u201d AR Tab 19 at 581. In light of these anticipated purchases, Eco Tour asserts that Jackson Hole and Hole Hiking did, in fact, have start-up costs, and therefore the NPS acted arbitrarily and capriciously in accepting Jackson Hole\u2019s and Hole Hiking\u2019s contrary representations. PL\u2019s Mot. at 24-25, 36-37; PL\u2019s Reply at 7-8.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-4\">The court agrees with Eco Tour that the NPS arbitrarily and capriciously determined that Jackson Hole and Hole Hiking had no start-up costs and that their failure to provide bank statements was immaterial. Although the evaluation panel, in its evaluation of Jackson Hole\u2019s proposal, acknowledged Jackson Hole\u2019s anticipated purchase of a [] and [], AR Tab 23 at 1114, the panel subsequently ignored this information in its responsiveness evaluation, in which it concluded that \u201cJackson Hole\u2019s status as the incumbent concessioner supported Jackson Hole\u2019s assertion that it had no start-up costs,\u201d AR Tab 42 at 1306. Similarly, in concluding that Hole Hiking had no start-up costs, <em>see </em>AR Tab 43 at 1346, the panel completely ignored Hole Hiking\u2019s anticipated purchase of [] and [] \u201c[a]t the beginning of the year,\u201d AR Tab 19 at 581.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-5\">To the extent that the panel mentioned this information at all in its responsiveness determinations, it merely noted that \u201cJackson Hole\u2019s anticipated purchases were not firm commitments\u201d and that Jackson Hole\u2019s failure to identify these as start-up costs \u201cis immaterial because these purchases are not required by the terms of the Prospectus, including the Draft Contract.\u201d AR Tab 42 at 1306. Defendant relies upon this statement to argue that Jackson Hole\u2019s failure to provide bank statements to prove its financial ability to make its anticipated purchases was immaterial because such purchases were not required by the terms of the prospectus. Def.\u2019s Mot. at 18; Def.\u2019s Reply at 9-10 (citing AR Tab 42 at 1306). This argument fails for the simple reason that nothing in principal selection subfactors 4(b) or 4(c) limits the requirement to identify start-up costs (and to demonstrate financial ability to pay for such costs by providing bank statements) to only those start-up costs specifically required by the prospectus. To the contrary, principal selection subfaetor 4(b)(2) directed offerors to \u201cprovide estimates for the Personal Property items (Equipment) that you need to acquire in order to begin operating,\u201d AR Tab 4 at 51, and principal selection subfaetor 4(c) directed offerors to demonstrate their \u201cability to obtain the required funds\u201d for such start-up costs, AR Tab 4 at 54.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-7\">Defendant\u2019s additional arguments fare no better. For instance, defendant argues that Hole Hiking\u2019s failure to report [ ] and [ ] as start-up costs, and to provide bank statements demonstrating its ability to obtain funds for such costs, is immaterial because the total cost of the [ ] and [ ] is low and \u201cwill likely not prevent Hole Hiking from performing the contract.\u201d Def.\u2019s Mot. at 19; <em>see also </em>Def.\u2019s Reply at 10. However, nothing in principal selection subfactors 4(b) or 4(c) limits the requirement to identify start-up costs (and to demonstrate financial ability to pay for such costs) to only those start-up costs above a certain dollar amount. To the contrary, principal selection subfactor 4(c) expressly states that \u201c[cjurrent bank statements must be provided <em>even if you do not anticipate significant start-up costs.\u201d </em>AR Tab 4 at 54 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b42-8\">Finally, defendant argues that, even assuming that Jackson Hole and Hole Hiking failed to demonstrate their ability to obtain the required funds for start-up costs, Eco Tour\u2019s proposal suffered from the same defect, and should likewise be rejected as non-responsive, because Eco Tour failed to explain the cost of and to demonstrate funding for its anticipated conversion to natural gas. Def.\u2019s Mot. at 18-19 (citing AR Tab 21 at 901 (describing Eco Tour\u2019s plan to convei\u2019t one-half of its vehicles to natural gas \u201cin the first year after a compressed natural gas filling station comes to ... Jackson, Wyoming,\u201d and to convert the other half the following year, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>with unspecified \u201cviable grant sources\u201d), and Tab 22 at 1086 (same)). This argument is similarly unpersuasive because, unlike Jackson Hole and Hole Hiking, both of whom anticipated making purchases of equipment at the beginning of the 2014 winter season, Eco Tour anticipated converting one-half of its vehicles to natural gas \u201cin the first year after a compressed natural gas filling station comes to ... Jackson, Wyoming,\u201d and the other half \u201cduring the second year that [a natural gas] fuel source is available in Jackson.\u201d AR Tab 21 at 901, Tab 22 at 1086. Athough Eco Tour \u201cestimate[d]\u201d that a compressed natural gas filling station would arrive in Jackson \u201cin early 2014,\u201d this was merely an estimate and, ultimately, outside of Eco Tour\u2019s control. <em>Id. </em>Thus, Eco Tour\u2019s anticipated conversion to natural gas cannot reasonably be deemed to constitute a start-up cost.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">b. Jackson Hole\u2019s Failure to Provide a Balance Sheet and Credit Report (Principal Selection Subfactor 4(a))</p>\n<p id=\"b43-6\">The NPS also determined that Jackson Hole failed to provide a balance sheet and credit report as required under principal selection subfactor 4(a). AR Tab 23 at 1112, Tab 30 at 1192, Tab 42 at 1305-06. The NPS nevertheless concluded that these omissions were immaterial because the NPS was able to obtain the missing information by reviewing Jackson Hole\u2019s business history form, AFRs, and financial projections and assumptions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-7\">[Principal selection subfactor 4(a) ] requests the Offeror to demonstrate that it has a credible, proven track record of meeting financial obligations by submitting (1) a business history form; (2) a balance sheet; (3) Annual Financial Report (AFRs) (for current concessioners) OR financial statements (for interested parties who are not current concessioners); and (4) a credit report. Jackson Hole submitted a complete business history form and two years of AFRs. However, Jackson Hole did not submit a balance sheet, and provided a Dun &amp; Bradstreet Company ID instead of a physical copy of the credit report. The Service does not have access to credit reporting services.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AR\">By analyzing the business history form and the AFRs in combination with the projections and assumptions supplied in [principal selection subfactor 4(b) ], the panel determined that Jackson Hole had a credible proven track record of meeting its financial obligations and would have the operating income to satisfy its liabilities. All of the information supplied on the business history form was positive, and both of Jackson Hole\u2019s AFRs revealed a positive net income. A balance sheet and physical credit report might have provided further corroboration, but the Panel did not view these omissions as material.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b43-9\">AR Tab 42 at 1305-06.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-10\">Eco Tour argues that the NPS could not effectively evaluate Jackson Hole\u2019s financial ability to carry out its proposal without the balance sheet and credit report, and, therefore, the NPS arbitrarily and capriciously determined that Jackson Hole\u2019s failure to provide these documents was immaterial. Pl.\u2019s Mot. at 34-35; Pl.\u2019s Reply at 6-7. In that regard, Eco Tour first asserts that Jackson Hole\u2019s business history form consists solely of uncorroborated \u201cone-word responses\u201d to general questions regarding Jackson Hole\u2019s recent history of default, bankruptcy, foreclosure, receivership, or litigation related to unmet financial obligations. Pl.\u2019s Mot. at 35 (citing AR Tab 20 at 719). Next, Eco Tour argues that the AFRs submitted by Jackson Hole \u201cmerely pertain to [Jackson Hole\u2019s] revenues and expenses under the pri- or contract,\u201d and do not demonstrate anything about Jackson Hole\u2019s \u201ctrack record of meeting its financial obligations.\u201d Pl.\u2019s Mot. at 35 (citing AR Tab 20 at 705-18); <em>see also </em>Pl.\u2019s Reply at 7 (\u201cNowhere in those documents does [Jackson Hole] state its current credit status, amount of assets, funding or available cash.\u201d). As a result, Eco Tour contends, the NPS \u201cwas totally unaware of the status of [Jackson Hole\u2019s] current cash assets, its corporate balance sheet health and its credit rating.\u201d Pl.\u2019s Reply at 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-11\">The court agrees with Eco Tour that the NPS acted arbitrarily and capriciously in concluding that Jackson Hole\u2019s failure to provide a balance sheet and credit report was immaterial to an effective evaluation of Jack<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>son Hole\u2019s history of meeting its financial obligations. Principal selection subfactor 4(a) required Jackson Hole to \u201c[demonstrate ... a <em>credible, proven </em>track record of meeting [its] financial obligations.\u201d AR Tab 4 at 49 (emphasis added). The financial information Jackson Hole supplied did not demonstrate such a track record. While the AFRs submitted by Jackson Hole indicate its gross receipts and expenses under its current contract, they provide no information regarding the extent of Jackson Hole\u2019s liabilities or its credit history. <em>See </em>AR Tab 20 at 705-18. At most, the AFRs demonstrate that Jackson Hole has achieved a positive net income under its current contract. A positive net income, however, cannot allay potential concerns regarding the extent of Jackson Hole\u2019s liabilities as compared to its assets, nor can it demonstrate that Jackson Hole has a history of paying its debts. Additionally, although the pro forma income statement and operating assumptions submitted by Jackson Hole under principal selection subfaetor 4(b) demonstrate Jackson Hole\u2019s projections and assumptions regarding its <em>future </em>performance and profitability, they provide no information regarding Jackson Hole\u2019s <em>prior </em>\u201ctrack record\u201d of meeting its financial obligations. <em>See </em>AR Tab 20 at 721-23. Therefore, the NPS\u2019s conclusion that Jackson Hole\u2019s AFRs, pro forma income statement, and operating assumptions were sufficient to demonstrate Jackson Hole\u2019s \u201ctrack record of meeting its financial obligations\u201d was arbitrary and capricious.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-4\">Defendant posits that Jackson Hole\u2019s business history form\u2014on which Jackson Hole indicated, <em>inter alia, </em>that it had never defaulted on a concession contract, had no recent bankruptcies or foreclosures, and had been the subject of no recent lawsuits or administrative proceedings\u2014adequately demonstrated Jackson Hole\u2019s history of meeting its financial obligations. Def.\u2019s Mot. at 18 (citing AR Tab 20 at 719). Defendant argues that the NPS was entitled to \u201caccept Jackson Hole\u2019s responses without confirming them accuracy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 17. In support of this argument, defendant quotes from <em>L-3 Global Communications Solutions, Inc. v. United States, </em>82 Fed.Cl. 604, 609 (2008), for the proposition that \u201cthe test for noneompliance is generally a test of facial noncompliance, not a test as to whether the subjective, undisclosed intent of an offeror is noncompliant with the solicitation\u2019s requirements,\u201d and <em>Akal Sec., Inc. v. United States, </em>103 Fed.Cl. 310, 326 (2011), for the proposition that \u201c[c]ontracting officers generally are entitled to rely on information available to them at the time of a responsibility determination, absent any indication that the information is defective, unsupported, or suspect.\u201d Def.\u2019s Mot. at 17. Yet, in making this argument, defendant ignores the plain language of principal selection subfactor 4(a), which required Jackson Hole to demonstrate a \u201ccredible\u201d and \u201cproven\u201d record of meeting its financial obligations by presenting documentary proof in the form of a balance sheet and credit report. AR Tab 4 at 49. Defendant also relies upon inapposite case law. Unlike <em>L-3 Global, </em>in which \u201call three bids were facially compliant with the solicitation\u2019s requirements,\u201d 82 Fed.Cl. at 612, Jackson Hole\u2019s proposal omits required financial information and, thus, is noncompliant on its face. Defendant\u2019s citation to <em>Akal </em>is likewise off the mark because <em>Akal </em>involved a determination of whether the prevailing bidder was a \u201cresponsible offeror,\u201d not whether it had submitted a proposal that was responsive to the material terms and conditions of the solicitation. <em>See </em>103 Fed.Cl. at 324-26.</p>\n<p id=\"AGx\">c. Deficiencies in Hole Hiking\u2019s Financial Records (Principal Selection Subfactors 4(a) and 4(b))</p>\n<p id=\"b44-7\">Finally, as noted, the NPS determined that Hole Hiking\u2019s financial documents omitted information and contained errors. AR Tab 24 at 1139-40, Tab 31 at 1195, Tab 43 at 1345-46. Specifically, the NPS concluded that: (1) the AFRs submitted by Hole Hiking were each missing a page, AR Tab 24 at 1139, Tab 31 at 1195, Tab 43 at 1345-46; (2) Hole Hiking\u2019s pro forma income statement and operating assumptions failed to explain \u201cwhy [Hole Hiking\u2019s] revenue projections are so much higher than historical projections and why some of the expense assumptions appear low,\u201d Tab 31 at 1195; <em>see also </em>AR Tab 24 at 1140; (3) Hole Hiking\u2019s pro forma income statement contained \u201cnumerous mistakes,\u201d AR Tab 24 at 1140, includ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>ing \u201cmathematical errors,\u201d Tab 31 at 1195; and, (4) Hole Hiking\u2019s balance sheet contained certain unspecified \u201canomalies,\u201d AR Tab 43 at 1346, which raised \u201cconeern[s]\u201d regarding Hole Hiking\u2019s financial position, AR Tab 24 at 1139.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-5\">The NPS nevertheless concluded that these deficiencies were immaterial, and that \u201c[t]he Panel was able to evaluate the proposal and conclude [that] Hole Hiking had the financial ability to carry out the terms and conditions of the contract.\u201d AR Tab 43 at 1346. With respect to principal selection subfaetor 4(a), the Park Service determined that \u201c[although each AFR was missing a page, the panel was able to use the information provided [on the business history form and credit report] to estimate a positive net income.\u201d AR Tab 43 at 1345. Additionally, the NPS concluded that \u201c[although the current liability information supplied on the balance sheet was somewhat ambiguous, Hole Hiking\u2019s credit report demonstrated that it had satisfied its liabilities in the past,\u201d and, \u201c[t]herefore, the panel concluded [that] Hole Hiking would have the operating income to satisfy its liabilities.\u201d AR Tab 43 at 1345. With respect to principal selection subfactor 4(b), the NPS simply noted that \u201cHole Hiking submitted the requested forms.\u201d AR Tab 43 at 1346.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">Eco Tour argues that \u201cHole Hiking did not fully explain its assumptions that future revenues would be much higher than past levels and expenses would be very low,\u201d and, therefore, the NPS arbitrarily and capriciously determined that the deficiencies in Hole Hiking\u2019s financial documentation were immaterial. Pl.\u2019s Mot. at 36. Eco Tom- also asserts that Hole Hiking\u2019s financial projections are \u201cfurther suspect given that Hole Hiking reported total gross revenues in 2010/2011 of $21,835 based on 569 total tours,\u201d resulting in approximately $38 of revenue per tour\u2014 which Eco Tour contends is \u201cwell below the approved rates\u201d under Hole Hiking\u2019s current contract (contract GRTE032-03). <em>Id. </em>at 36 n. 9 (citing AR Tab 4 at 23-24 (listing annual gross revenue for the last three seasons under contracts GRTE024-03 and GRTE03203), and Tab 8 at 186 (listing approved rates under Hole Hiking\u2019s current contract)); <em>see also </em>Tab 19 at 618 (listing Hole Hiking\u2019s projected revenue per tour under contract GRTE032-13). Defendant offers no rebuttal other than to assert that Eco Tour \u201cmisreads the charts\u201d on the prospectus, which show that Hole Hiking led only 294 tours during the 2010/2011 season resulting in approximately $74 of revenue per tour\u2014which defendant implies is much closer to the approved rates under Hole Hiking\u2019s current contract. Def.\u2019s Mot. at 19 (citing AR Tab 4 at 23-24).</p>\n<p id=\"b45-8\">Here again, the court must agree with Eco Tour that the NPS failed to provide a rational basis for its determination that the errors and omissions in Hole Hiking\u2019s financial information were immaterial. Although the NPS rationally determined that Hole Hiking\u2019s omissions under principal selection sub-factor 4(a) were immaterial <em>(i.e., </em>missing pages in the AFRs and ambiguous current liability information on the balance sheet) because the NPS could determine from the business history form and credit report that Hole Hiking had \u201csatisfied its liabilities in the past,\u201d AR Tab 43 at 1345, the NPS failed to even address the mathematical errors on Hole Hiking\u2019s pro forma income statement and Hole Hiking\u2019s unexplained revenue and expense projections. AR Tab 43 at 1346. Rather, the NPS merely stated, without explanation, that \u201cHole Hiking submitted the requested forms.\u201d AR Tab 43 at 1346. The NPS\u2019s failure to provide any explanation with respect to its materiality determination as to the pro forma income statement and operating assumptions is wholly arbitrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-9\">For the aforementioned reasons, the court concludes that each of the NPS\u2019s materiality determinations, as well as its resulting responsiveness determinations, was arbitrary, capricious, and an abuse of discretion. Therefore, the court must proceed to determine, as a factual matter, whether Eco Tour was prejudiced by the NPS\u2019s arbitrary and unlawful conduct. <em>See Bannum, </em>404 F.3d at 1351.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-10\">4. Prejudice Resulting from the NPS\u2019s Responsiveness Determinations</p>\n<p id=\"b45-11\">As noted, to demonstrate prejudice, Eco Tour must show a \u201csubstantial chance\u201d that it would have received the disputed contracts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>if not for the NPS\u2019s arbitrary and capricious responsiveness determinations. <em>See id. </em>at 1353. The court concludes that Eco Tour has made such a showing because it submitted responsive proposals that received the highest cumulative scores of any of the proposals received by the NPS for the disputed contracts. AR Tab 23 at 1094, Tab 24 at 1120, Tabs 28-29. Thus, in accordance with the regulations, there is a substantial chance that Eco Tour would have been awarded the disputed contracts if not for the errors alleged in the amended complaint. <em>See </em>36 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 51.31, 51.33.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-4\">B. The Agency\u2019s Disclosure of the Better Terms of Eco Tour\u2019s Proposals (Count II)</p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">With respect to Count II, presented as an alternative to Count I, Eco Tour argues that the NPS improperly disclosed to Jackson Hole and Hole Hiking the better terms of Eco Tour\u2019s proposals in contravention of paragraph 4 of the prospectus instructions. Pl.\u2019s Mot. at 8-15, 40-42; Pl.\u2019s Reply at 20-21.

Eco Tour asserts that the NPS, in paragraph 4, \u201cpromised offerors ... that it would not disclose confidential information included in the proposals.\u201d Pl.\u2019s Mot. at 40. Eco Tour further asserts that its \u201creasonable assumption ... in light of [the] NPS\u2019s unqualified agreement to not disclose confidential information was that [Eco Tour] would be provided with the opportunity to agree to have its confidential information disclosed to its competitor, but that it did not have to agree.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 40-41. \u201cIf [Eco Tour] did not want this disclosure to occur, it would have the option of withdrawing its proposal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 41.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-14\">Eco Tom\u2019 argues that the NPS improperly disclosed Eco Tour\u2019s confidential information\u2014in contravention of paragraph 4 of the prospectus instructions, and in violation of the Procurement Integrity Act as well as the implied contract to consider bids fairly and honestly\u2014by identifying the better terms and conditions of Eco Tour\u2019s proposals in the NPS\u2019s June 20, 2013 letters to Jackson Hole and Hole Hiking. <em>Id. </em>at 15, 40-41.

Eco Tour Has Not Waived Its Unlawful Disclosure Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">Defendant argues, unpersuasively, that Eco Tom- has waived its objection to the NPS\u2019s disclosure of the better terms of Eco Tour\u2019s proposals. Def.\u2019s Mot. at 23; Def.\u2019s Reply at 14. The government\u2019s waiver theory is premised upon its characterization of Count II as a challenge to the terms of the prospectus, which notified potential offerors that \u201c[i]f an existing Concessioner submits a responsive proposal and that proposal is not selected as the best proposal, the Preferred Offeror designation allows it to match the terms of the best offer and be awarded the Contract.\u201d AR Tab 4 at 24. Defendant contends that pursuant to this language in the prospectus, \u201cEco Tour ... was on notice that \u2018terms of the best offer\u2019 could be disclosed\u201d and, therefore, waived its right to object to this language by not objecting before the close of bidding. Def.\u2019s Mot. at 23 (citing <em>Blue &amp; Gold Fleet, </em>492 F.3d at 1313). However, in Count II, Eco Tour does not object to any terms of the prospectus, but rather <em>invokes </em>the confidentiality provisions in paragraph 4 of the prospectus instructions. <em>See </em>PL\u2019s Mot. at 8-15, 40-42; PL\u2019s Reply at 20-21.

No Violation of the Procurement Integrity Act</p>\n<p id=\"b47-8\">The government asserts that Count II fails to the extent that it arises under the Procurement Integrity Act because NPS concession contracts are not \u201cprocurement\u201d contracts, as that term is defined by the Procurement Integrity Act. Def.\u2019s Mot. at 23-24; Def.\u2019s Reply at 14. The court agrees. The Procurement Integrity Act generally prohibits, \u201c[ejxcept as provided by law,\u201d the disclosure of \u201ccontractor bid or proposal information or source selection information before the award of a Federal agency procurement contract to which the information relates.\u201d 41 U.S.C. \u00a7 2102(a)(1). \u201cFederal agency procurement\u201d is defined under the statute as \u201cthe acquisition (by using competitive procedures and awarding a contract) of goods or services (including construction) from non-Federal sources by a Federal agency using appropriated funds.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2101(4). The disputed concession contracts do not satisfy that definition. First, as explained <em>swpra, </em>the court concludes that NPS concession contracts, such as those in dispute in this bid protest, are not contracts for the procurement of goods and services. Second, even if NPS concession contracts did involve the acquisition of goods or services for the benefit of the government, they do not involve the expenditure of appropriated funds by the NPS. Rather, such contracts \u201cprovide for payment <em>to the government </em>of a franchise fee or such other monetary consideration as determined by the Secretary.\u201d 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 5956(a) (emphasis added); <em>see also </em>36 C.F.R. \u00a7 51.78 (\u201cConcession contracts will provide for payment <em>to the government </em>of a franchise fee or other monetary consideration as determined by the Director upon consideration of the probable value to the concessioner of the privileges granted by the contract involved.\u201d) (emphasis added). Therefore, the Procurement Integrity Act does not apply to Eco Tour\u2019s bid protest.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-10\">Additionally, defendant contends that even if the Procurement Integrity Act were applicable to the instant lawsuit, it has not been violated because the allegedly confidential information disclosed to Jackson Hole and Hole Hiking was already public knowledge. Def.\u2019s Mot. at 24-26; Def.\u2019s Reply at 14-15. Again, the court agrees with defendant. As noted, the Procurement Integrity Act applies only to the disclosure of \u201ccontractor bid or proposal information.\u201d 41 U.S.C. \u00a7 2102(a)(1). The term \u201ccontractor bid or proposal information\u201d is defined as certain types of information submitted to a federal agency in connection with a proposal to enter into a procurement contract \u201cif that information previously has not been made available to the public or disclosed publicly.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2101(2). The NPS\u2019s letters to Jackson <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>Hole and Hole Hiking did not mention Eco Tour by name, nor did they disclose any information about the better terms of Eco Tom\u2019s proposals that was not otherwise publicly known. <em>See </em>AR Tabs 30-31. The twelve better terms of Eco Tour\u2019s proposals included: minimizing the idling of vehicles; using binoculars, spill kits, human waste removal bags, and reusable plates, utensils, mugs, and water bottles; disposing of waste outside the park; requiring guides to receive Wilderness First Responder certification and training in winter driving and the Wilderness Act; and, unannounced monitoring of guides. <em>See </em>AR Tab 30 at 1190-91, Tab 31 at 1193-94. The availability of such practices, none of which involve the use of Eco Tour\u2019s proprietary information or trade secrets, is within the realm of public knowledge. Indeed, as defendant notes, four of the twelve disclosed terms\u2014the use of binoculars, spill kits, solid human waste removal bags, and disposal of trash outside the park\u2014were already in use by one or both of the preferred offerors by the time the NPS sent its June 20, 2013 letters. <em>See </em>AR Tab 19 at 578 (Hole Hiking\u2019s proposal stating that \u201c[w]e carry plastic bags and offer to guest[s] if needed for any refuse ____ [and] then dispose[] of [such bags] in appropriate container[s],\u201d and that \u201c[w]e purchase environmentally approved products such as recyclable napkins and containers\u201d), Tab 20 at 642 (Jackson Hole\u2019s proposal stating that \u201c[e]lients are educated on \u2018Leave-No-Trace\u2019 principles and guides sweep all rest/break areas for waste before departing,\u201d and that Jackson Hole \u201ccommits to including a set of binoculars in every guide pack\u201d), Tab 20 at 645 (Jackson Hole\u2019s proposal stating that \u201c[a]ll guides carry one emergency \u2018wag-bag\u2019 \u201d), AR Tab 34 at 1204-05 (Jackson Hole\u2019s response to the NPS\u2019s June 20, 2013 letter stating that Jackson Hole \u201ccurrently supplies spill kits for all vehicles and commits to continuing to do so,\u201d and that Jackson Hole \u201ccurrently use[s] the <em>Wag Bag Wastekit </em>[human waste disposal] product\u201d and \u201c[a]ll guide packs are, and will continue to be, supplied with this product\u201d), Tab 45 at 1405 (Hole Hiking\u2019s response to the NPS\u2019s June 20, 2013 letter stating that \u201c[Hole Hiking] guides always carry a minimum of one pair of binoculars on each tour\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b48-8\">Eco Tour counters, unpersuasively, that the twelve better terms of Eco Tour\u2019s proposals that were disclosed by the NPS were not publicly known because, if they were, Jackson Hole and Hole Hiking \u201cwould have included those policies in them proposals.\u201d Pl.\u2019s Mot. at 41; <em>see also </em>PL\u2019s Reply at 21. Yet, of course, the fact that the preferred offerors did not include particular terms in their proposals does not prove that such terms were not publicly known. Next, Eco Tour asserts that, even if the twelve better terms of its proposals constitute public information when considered in isolation, its particular combination of such terms is a \u201cconfidential and strategic business decision.\u201d PL\u2019s Reply at 20. According to Eco Tour, \u201c[s]imply because the public knows that some of those items exist does not mean that a company\u2019s strategic decision to include them in its proposal is also public knowledge.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 20-21. This argument, too, is unpersuasive. Under Eco Tour\u2019s argument, <em>any </em>business practice undertaken by a concessioner, no matter how commonly employed in the industry, would qualify as confidential so long as it is combined with other similarly common practices. This view is not in accordance with law. Although the court recognizes that a particular combination of individual pieces of information in the public domain may qualify as a trade secret if the combination is itself not generally known or not easily duplicated,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> the combination of Eco Tour\u2019s twelve better terms does not meet that standard. As noted above, none of these twelve better terms involved proprietary information or trade secrets, and four of the terns were already in use by Jackson Hole and Hole Hiking. Eco Tour has offered no evidence to support its view that the combination of the twelve better terms of its proposals was not generally known or not easily duplicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>For the foregoing reasons, the court concludes that even if the Procurement Integrity Act were applicable to Eco Tour\u2019s bid protest, it was not violated in this instance because none of the information disclosed to Jackson Hole and Hole Hiking constitutes \u201ccontractor bid or proposal information\u201d as defined by the Act. Therefore, Count II fails to the extent that it is based upon an alleged violation of the Procurement Integrity Act.</p>\n<p id=\"AYL\">3. No Breach of the Implied Contract to Consider Bids Fairly and Honestly</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">The government also argues that Eco Tour has failed to prove that the NPS\u2019s disclosure of the better terms of Eco Tour\u2019s proposals breached the implied-in-fact contract to consider bids fairly and honestly. Def.\u2019s Mot. at 27; Def.\u2019s Reply at 16. Again, the court agrees with defendant. As noted, to recover under the implied contract for bids to be fairly and honestly considered, Eco Tour must establish that the NPS acted arbitrarily or capriciously, or abused its discretion. <em>E.g., Southfork, </em>141 F.3d at 1132 (citing <em>Keco II, </em>492 F.2d at 1203-04). Four factors are generally relevant to a determination of whether the government has breached the implied contract to consider bids fairly: (1) subjective bad faith on the part of the government; (2) the absence of a reasonable basis for the administrative decision; (3) the amount of discretion afforded to the procurement officials by applicable statutes and regulations; and (4) proven violations of pertinent statutes or regulations. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">Eco Tour has not demonstrated that the agency\u2019s disclosure of the better terms of Eco Tour\u2019s proposals was motivated by bad faith, lacked a reasonable basis, or violated any statute or regulation. To the contrary, under the regulations, the NPS was required to \u201cadvise the preferred offeror of the better terms and conditions of the best proposal and permit the preferred offeror to amend its proposal to match them.\u201d 36 C.F.R. \u00a7 51.32. The NPS\u2019s June 20, 2013 letters to the preferred offerors complied with this regulatory provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-7\">Additionally, while paragraph 4 of the prospectus instructions provided that the NPS would not make public any information specifically marked in Eco Tour\u2019s proposal as a trade secret or as \u201cconfidential commercial and financial information,\u201d <em>see </em>AR Tab 4 at 28, Eco Tour failed to mark its proposals in accordance with paragraph 4. Specifically, Eco Tour failed to mark the cover pages of its proposals with the legend specified in paragraph 4(b), and also failed to specifically identify the allegedly confidential information in its proposals as required by paragraph 4(b). <em>Compare </em>AR Tab 4 at 28 (requiring the offeror to \u201cmark the cover page of each copy of the proposal with the following legend\u201d and to \u201cspecifically identify what you consider to be trade secret information or confidential commercial or financial information on the page of the proposal on which it appears\u201d), <em>with </em>AR Tabs 21-22 (showing that Eco Tour\u2019s proposals lack legends on cover pages and specific identification of confidential information). Athough Eco Tour marked most pages of its proposals with the general disclaimer set forth in paragraph 4(b), it failed to satisfy the second requirement of paragraph 4(b), which was to \u201cspecifically identify\u201d the allegedly confidential information. <em>See </em>AR Tab 4 at 28 (\u201cYou must specifically identify what you consider to be trade secret information or confidential commercial or financial information on the page of the proposal on which it appears, <em>and </em>you must mark each such page with the following legend____\u201d) (emphasis added). Therefore, even if paragraph 4 would otherwise prohibit the NPS from disclosing Eco Tour\u2019s properly identified confidential information, Eco Tour cannot take advantage of such protection after having failed to comply with the requirements of paragraph 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-11\">4. Eco Tour Has Not Demonstrated Prejudice Resulting from the Alleged Improper Disclosure</p>\n<p id=\"b49-12\">Finally, the government contends that, even assuming that the NPS\u2019s disclosure of the better terms of Eco Tour\u2019s proposals violated the Procurement Integrity Act or breached the implied contract to consider bids fairly and honestly, Eco Tom\u2019 has failed to demonstrate prejudice. The court must again agree with defendant. In its motion, Eco Tour asserts, without explanation, that the NPS\u2019s disclosure caused Eco Tour unspecified \u201csubstantial harm.\u201d Pl.\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>Mot. at 41. Eco Tour reiterates this unsupported assertion in its reply brief and asserts that prejudice is \u201cobvious.\u201d Pl.\u2019s Reply at 21 (\u201c[B]y unilaterally disclosing these products and services to Eco Tour\u2019s direct competitors and explicitly informing those competitors that their competitor offered a better proposal because of these specific terms, NPS has now <em>totally eliminated Eco Tour\u2019s competitive advantage. </em>That is obvious prejudice.\u201d). These unsupported allegations of \u201csubstantial harm\u201d and elimination of competitive advantage cannot satisfy Eco Tour\u2019s burden to demonstrate that the government\u2019s disclosure of the better terms of Eco Tour\u2019s proposals deprived Eco Tour of a \u201csubstantial chance\u201d of being awarded the disputed contracts. <em>See Bannum, </em>404 F.3d at 1353.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-4\">Eco Tour\u2019s only specific allegation of prejudice is that the NPS deprived Eco Tour of the opportunity to \u201cweigh the risks of having its confidential information handed over to its competitors\u201d and to choose between \u201cagreeing] to have its confidential information disclosed to its competitor\u201d or \u201cwithdrawing its proposal.\u201d Pl.\u2019s Mot. at 41. This allegation is likewise insufficient to demonstrate prejudice. As defendant correctly notes, \u201c[a]n opportunity to withdraw from the competition would not have given Eco Tour a substantial chance of winning the competition.\u201d Def.\u2019s Mot. at 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">C. The Agency\u2019s Failure to Require Hole Hiking to Use Biodiesel Fuel (Count III)</p>\n<p id=\"b50-6\">With respect to Count III, also presented as an alternative to Count I, Eco Tour argues that the NPS violated applicable law, acted arbitrarily and capriciously, and abused its discretion when it found that Hole Hiking had matched the better terms of Eco Tour\u2019s proposal for contract GRTE032-13. Pl.\u2019s Mot. at 15-16, 39; Pl.\u2019s Reply at 14-19. In its proposal, Eco Tour stated that it has used biodiesel fuel in all of its vehicles since 2008, AR Tab 22 at 937, and that, \u201c[u]nder the new concession contract, [it] will use biodiesel in over 60 percent of [its] vehicles until 100 percent of the vehicles have been converted [to] compressed natural gas,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 1086. Eco Tour contends that the NPS, by not requiring Hole Hiking to match this term of Eco Tour\u2019s proposal, violated 36 C.F.R. \u00a7 51.32, which requires the NPS to \u201cadvise the preferred offeror of the better terms and conditions of the best proposal and permit the preferred offeror to amend its proposal to match them.\u201d Pl.\u2019s Mot. at 39.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b50-11\">In response, the government first argues that the NPS is not obligated to require Hole Hiking to use biodiesel in its vehicles in order to exercise a right of preference because doing so would violate 36 C.F.R. \u00a7 51.19, which prohibits the agency from awarding a concession contract which \u201cmaterially amends\u201d the terms and conditions of the draft concession contract set forth in the prospectus \u201c[e]xcept for incorporating into the concession contract appropriate elements of the best proposal.\u201d Def.\u2019s Mot. at 21; Def.\u2019s Reply at 11. In that regard, the government asserts that the utilization of alternative fuels in vehicles is not \u201cappropriate\u201d for the disputed contracts because such contracts are for cross-country ski tours, not vehicle-based tours. Def.\u2019s Mot. at 21; Def.\u2019s Reply at 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-12\">Eco Tour argues, in rebuttal, that \u201cthe use of alternative fuel vehicles was appropriate and a better term in Eco Tour\u2019s proposal\u201d because it \u201cresultfs] in greatly reduced emissions, thus protecting the environment in and around Grand Teton National Park\u201d in furtherance of the goals articulated under principal selection subfactor 1(a) and secondary selection factor 1. Pl.\u2019s Reply at 14. The government responds that the only environmental practices required under principal selection subfactor 1(a) and secondary selection factor 1 are \u201cthose that protect the park from contamination,\u201d and that the use of alternative fuels is but one of \u201cnumerous environmental practices in [Eco Tour\u2019s] proposal\u201d which \u201chave nothing to do with protecting the park environment during a ski tour.\u201d Def.\u2019s Reply at 12-13.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>By way of background, principal selection subfaetor 1(a) directs offerors to \u201cdescribe how you will conduct your operations in a manner that will minimize disturbance to Park wildlife by addressing ... [t]he measures you will take to minimize disruption of wildlife while conducting tours.\u201d AR Tab 4 at 43. Secondary selection factor 1 is the \u201cquality of the offeror\u2019s proposal to conduct its operations in a manner that furthers the protection, conservation, and preservation of the park <em>and other resources </em>through environmental management programs and activities, including, without limitation, <em>energy conservation, </em>waste reduction, and recycling.\u201d AR Tab 4 at 57 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b51-4\">Eco Tour\u2019s argument regarding biodiesel is not without support in the record. In rating Eco Tour\u2019s proposal for contract GRTE032-13 as \u201cexcellent\u201d under principal selection subfaetor 1(a), the evaluation panel noted that Eco Tour\u2019s commitment to an \u201cidle free policy\u201d with its tour vehicles helped to \u201cminimize disruption of wildlife while conducting tours.\u201d AR Tab 24 at 1122. The NPS also required Hole Hiking to match Eco Tour\u2019s \u201cidle free policy\u201d because such a policy \u201cminimize[s] any disturbance to wildlife from the sound of a running vehicle.\u201d AR Tab 31 at 1193. In its proposal for contract GRTE032-13, Eco Tour stated that using biodiesel not only reduces total vehicle emissions, but also produces \u201cless offensive\u201d vehicle exhaust than petroleum-based fuel. AR Tab 22 at 937 (\u201cBiodiesel is a fuel made in this country that has safer emissions than regular fuel. Life cycle analysis completed by the <em>National Renewable Energy Laboratory, </em>and later by <em>Argonne National Laboratory, </em>found that greenhouse gas emissions for biodiesel could be more than 52 percent lower than those from other petroleum products. In addition, the smell of exhaust is less offensive than petroleum exhaust.\u201d), 1086 (\u201cThe biodiesel fuel we have used since 2008 is produced in Colorado and is made from used vegetable oil or soybean oil. The fuel releases carbon dioxide into the air in smaller quantities than does petroleum-based fuel.\u201d). Thus, the record suggests that Eco Tour\u2019s use of biodiesel fuel, like its \u201cidle free policy,\u201d may reduce the disturbance of wildlife in furtherance of the goals articulated under principal selection subfaetor 1(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">Additionally, in rating Eco Tour\u2019s proposal for contract GRTE032-13 as \u201cvery good\u201d under secondary selection factor 1, the evaluation panel took into account Eco Tour\u2019s \u201cmultiple company-wide policies and practices related to environmental stewardship, <em>such as using biofuel, </em>using \u2018green\u2019 cleaning products, and contributing to a carbon-offset fund.\u201d AR Tab 24 at 1144 (emphasis added). Therefore, at least one of the goals articulated in the prospectus is the conservation of energy, and the NPS expressly recognized that Eco Tour\u2019s use of biodiesel fuel furthered that goal.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-7\">However, despite the foregoing, the court is unable to conclude that the NPS violated applicable law, acted arbitrarily or capriciously, or abused its discretion in not requiring Hole Hiking to use biodiesel or similar alternative fuels in its tour vehicles. First, in requiring the preferred offerors to adopt an \u201cidle free policy\u201d under principal selection subfactor 1(a), the NPS appears to have been primarily concerned with the disturbance caused by \u201cthe sound of a running vehicle.\u201d AR Tab 31 at 1193. Even if biodiesel fuel produces \u201cless offensive\u201d vehicle exhaust than petroleum-based fuel, <em>see </em>AR Tab 22 at 937, the record contains no evidence that vehicles using biodiesel fuel produce less noise than vehicles using petroleum-based fuel. Thus, the record does not establish that the use of biodiesel fuel achieves precisely the same environmental benefits as an \u201cidle free policy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b51-8\">Second, Eco Tour\u2019s use of biodiesel fuel was but one of several \u201ccompanywide policies and practices related to environmental stewardship\u201d that the NPS considered in its evaluation of Eco Tour\u2019s proposal under secondary selection factor 1. AR Tab 24 at 1144. Other such policies and practices included utilizing \u201cgreen\u201d cleaning products and contributing to a carbon-offset fund. <em>Id. </em>Under Eco Tour\u2019s theory, the NPS should have required Hole Hiking to match each of these terms. That the NPS did not do so provides support for the government\u2019s argument that the use of biodiesel fuel, like the use of \u201cgreen\u201d cleaning products and contributing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>to a carbon-offset fund, is outside the scope of the disputed contracts for guided cross-country ski tour concessions.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-4\">Therefore, although Eco Tour\u2019s use of biodiesel fuel could reasonably be viewed as furthering the goals articulated under principal selection subfactor 1(a) and secondary selection factor 1, Eco Tour has not shown that the NPS acted irrationally or arbitrarily in declining to require Hole Hiking to match this term, and the court will not second guess the agency\u2019s technical determination in that regard. <em>See, e.g., E.W. Bliss, </em>77 F.3d at 449 (\u201c[Technical ratings ... involve discretionary determinations of procurement officials that a court will not second guess.\u201d) (citations omitted); <em>Omega World Travel, Inc. v. United States, </em>54 Fed.Cl. 570, 578 (2002) (\u201cIt is well settled that contracting officers are given broad discretion with respect to evaluation of technical proposals.\u201d (citing <em>E.W.

United States, </em>7 Cl.Ct. 755, 762 (1985) (\u201c[W]here an agency\u2019s decisions are highly technical in nature, ... judicial restraint is appropriate and proper.\u201d (citing <em>Isometrics v. United States, </em>5 Cl.Ct. 420, 423 (1984))).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">V. Eco Tour is Limited to a Recovery of Bid Preparation Costs</p>\n<p id=\"b52-6\">Having determined that the NPS acted arbitrarily and capriciously in concluding that Jackson Hole\u2019s and Hole Hiking\u2019s proposals were responsive, and that Eco Tour was prejudiced as a result, the court now turns to the issue of the relief to be granted. The government argues that the court lacks authority to grant Eco Tour\u2019s requested injunctive and declaratory relief \u201cbecause 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1491(b) does not apply to concession contracts, and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1491(a) provides for only monetary relief.\u201d Def.\u2019s Mot. at 28; <em>see also </em>Def.\u2019s Reply at 17-20. For the reasons specified below, the court agrees that it lacks the authority to award injunctive or declaratory relief to Eco Tour. Therefore, Eco Tour is limited to an award of damages in the form of bid preparation costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-9\">Except in narrow statutorily defined circumstances, the Court of Federal Claims lacks jurisdiction to award injunctive or declaratory relief. <em>United Keetoowah Band of Cherokee Indians of Okla. v.

This court has statutory authority to award equitable relief in certain types of tax cases, <em>see </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1507 (2006); in \u201cnonmonetary disputes\u201d arising under the CDA, <em>see </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1491(a)(2); and, in procurement bid protests, <em>see </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1491(b)(2).

As an initial matter, this case is not a tax case, nor does it invoke the CDA Therefore, the first and second statutory bases for equitable relief are inapplicable. Additionally, as set forth <em>supra, </em>the court finds that the disputed concession contracts are not procurement contracts, and thus section 1491(b) is inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">Nor is Eco Tour entitled to injunctive or declaratory relief under section 1491(a). In its reply brief, Eco Tour suggests that the court may grant equitable relief under section 1491(a)(2) because such relief would be \u201c\u2018incident of and collateral\u2019 to a monetary judgment.\u201d Pl.\u2019s Reply at 22-23 (quoting <em>Voisin v.

Yet Eco Tour has not cited any case in which equitable relief was granted under section 1491(a)(2) in the context of a claim for breach of the implied contract to consider bids fairly and honestly.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">Additionally, the court concludes that Congress, by enacting ADRA in 1996, divested this court of authority to award equitable relief in bid protests pursued under an implied contract theory. Before the enactment of ADRA in 1996, this court\u2019s jurisdiction over bid protests was predicated on an implied contract between the government and prospective bidders to treat bidders\u2019 proposals fairly and honestly. <em>See, e.g., Resource Conservation, </em>597 F.3d at 1242; <em>Emery Worldwide Airlines, </em>264 F.3d at 1078-80 (explaining the \u201clong and complicated\u201d history of judicial review of government procurement decisions); <em>Impresa, </em>238 F.3d at 1331-32 (same); <em>Southfork, </em>141 F.3d at 1132; <em>CACI, Inc.-Federal, </em>719 F.2d at 1573; <em>United States v. John C. Grimberg Co., </em>702 F.2d 1362, 1367 (Fed.Cir.1983); <em>Keco Indus., Inc. v. United States, </em>428 F.2d 1233, 1237 (Ct.Cl. 1970) <em>(Keco I).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b53-7\">Until 1982, an aggrieved bidder asserting an implied contract claim \u201cwas typically limited to monetary relief such as bid preparation costs.\u201d <em>Impresa, </em>238 F.3d at 1331 (citing <em>Keco II, </em>492 F.2d at 1203, and <em>Finley v. United States, </em>31 Fed.Cl. 704, 708 (1994)); <em>see also Keco I, </em>428 F.2d at 1240 (\u201c[I]f it should be determined subsequently by the commissioner that plaintiffs bid was not treated honestly and fairly by the Government, then plaintiff should be allowed to recover only those costs incurred in preparing its technical proposals and bid.\u201d). In 1982, the court was first given authority to grant declaratory and injunctive relief in preaward bid protests pursued under an implied contract theory. Federal Courts Improvement Act of 1982, Pub.L. No. 97-164, sec. 133(a), \u00a7 1491(a)(3), 96 Stat. 25, 39-40. Such authority was formerly codified at 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1491(a)(3), which provided, in pertinent part: \u201c\u2018To afford complete relief on any contract claim brought before the contract is awarded, the court shall have exclusive jurisdiction to grant declaratory judgments and such equitable and extraordinary relief as it deems proper, including but not limited to injunctive relief.\u2019\u201d <em>Resource Conservation, </em>597 F.3d at 1244 n. 10 (quoting former section 1491(a)(3)).</p>\n<p id=\"b53-9\">In 1996, however, Congress enacted ADRA, which \u201crepealed former section 1491(a)(3), and enacted its substance as section 1491(b)(2).\u201d <em>Id. </em>In so doing, Congress removed bid protest remedies from section 1491(a) and provided this court with a new, and independent, basis for bid protest jurisdiction in section 1491(b), under which the Court of Federal Claims is authorized to award \u201cany relief that the court considers proper, including declaratory and injunctive relief.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1491(b)(2); see <em>also Lion Raisins, Inc. v. United States, </em>52 Fed. Cl. 115, 118 (2002) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b53-10\">Although the Federal Circuit has not had occasion to rule on the issue of whether the Court of Federal Claims has authority, postADRA, to grant equitable relief in implied contract bid protests pursued under section 1491(a), this court has consistently answered that question in the negative. <em>See Terry v. United States, </em>96 Fed.Cl. 131, 153 (2010) (citations omitted) (\u201cUnder section 1491(a)(1), plaintiff is precluded from obtaining equitable relief, which is only available for a section 1491(b)(1) protest, and is limited to a recovery of monetary damages that comprise the costs she incurred while preparing her proposal\u201d), <em>vacated in part on other grounds, </em>98 Fed.Cl. 736 (2011); <em>FAS Support, </em>93 Fed.Cl. at 694 (\u201cThe major difference between a protest brought under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1491(b)(1) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>and one brought pursuant to an implied contract under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1491(a)(1) is the equitable relief which is available for the section 1491(b)(1) protest, but not for breach of the implied contract. Only monetary relief is available for breach of the implied contract, comprising the costs incurred in preparing the proposal and bid.\u201d (citing <em>Keco I, </em>428 F.2d at 1240)); <em>Overstreet Elec. Co. v. United States, </em>47 Fed.Cl. 728, 731 n. 5 (2000) (noting that a claim for breach of an implied-in-fact contractual obligation to consider and treat all bids fairly \u201cno longer is the trigger for injunctive relief in this court\u201d); <em>W &amp; D Ships Deck Works, Inc. v. United States, </em>39 Fed.Cl. 638, 641 (1997) (\u201cThe repeal by [ADRA] ... of \u00a7 1491(a)(3) eliminated this court\u2019s statutory authority to grant equitable relief on the basis of the old implied contract theory.\u201d); <em>cf. L-3 Commc\u2019ns Integrated Sys., L.P. v. United States, </em>94 Fed.Cl. 394, 397 (2010) (\u201cSection 1491(a)(1) continues to allow any plaintiff, including a disappointed bidder, to invoke this Court\u2019s general contract jurisdiction to recover money damages, including bid preparation and proposal costs.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b54-4\">While the court is not bound to follow its prior decisions concerning the availability of equitable relief in bid protests pursued under an implied contract theory, it finds the reasoning of those decisions to be persuasive. Simply put, if equitable relief was unavailable in implied contract bid protests pursued under section 1491(a) until the enactment of section 1491(a)(3) in 1982, and section 1491(a)(3) was repealed with the enactment of ADRA in 1996, then it follows that equitable relief is again unavailable in implied contract bid protests pursued under section 1491(a). Accordingly, the court concludes that Eco Tom1 is precluded from obtaining injunctive and declaratory relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">In its reply brief, Eco Tour argues that \u201cthis Court has the explicit authority from Congress [under section 1491(a)(2) ] to issue as declaratory relief an order remanding this matter to NPS with directions as to what this Court deems proper and just.\u201d Pl.\u2019s Reply at 23. Specifically, Eco Tour asks the court to \u201cremand with a direction for NPS to review its decision that the preferred offerors\u2019 proposals were responsive and, even if NPS continues to find such proposals responsive, to provide direction that Hole Hiking needs to match Eco Tour\u2019s better terms.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 24. The court rejects Eco Tour\u2019s request for a remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-9\">Even if the court were authorized to grant a remand under section 1491(a)(2) in connection with a bid protest pursued under an implied contract theory (an issue which is far from certain<footnotemark>17</footnotemark>), Eco Tour\u2019s requested remand is beyond the scope of any such authority. Eco Tour would shoehorn into the court\u2019s ability to remand with \u201cproper and just\u201d directions unfettered authority for the court to issue essentially unlimited orders to the agency, such as requiring Hole Hiking to \u201cmatch Eco Tour\u2019s better terms.\u201d Pl.\u2019s Reply at 24. This treads beyond the proper scope of remand into the realm of injunctive relief. The power to remand with \u201cproper and just\u201d instructions cannot trump the unavailability of injunctive and declaratory relief under section 1491(a). <em>See, e.g., Todd Const., L.P. v. United States, </em>88 Fed.Cl. 235, 245 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b54-10\">For all of the foregoing reasons, the court concludes that Eco Tour is precluded from obtaining injunctive or declaratory relief and is limited to a recovery of monetary damages that comprise the costs Eco Tour incurred while preparing its proposal. Accordingly, the court need not consider the parties\u2019 remaining arguments concerning the particular equitable relief requested by Eco Tour.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-11\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b54-12\">The Park Service acted arbitrarily and capriciously in concluding that the financial information omitted from Jackson Hole\u2019s and Hole Hiking\u2019s proposals for the disputed contracts was immaterial, and therefore that Jackson Hole\u2019s and Hole Hiking\u2019s proposals were responsive to the requirements of the prospectus. Accordingly, in allowing Jackson Hole and Hole Hiking to match the better terms of Eco Tour\u2019s proposals for the disputed contracts, the Park Service breached the implied contract for bids to be fairly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>and honestly considered. As Eco Tour submitted responsive proposals for the disputed contracts that received the highest cumulative scores of any of the proposals received by the Park Service, Eco Tour has demonstrated a \u201csubstantial chance\u201d that it would have received the disputed contracts if not for the Park Service\u2019s arbitrary and capricious responsiveness determination with regard to the proposals of Jackson Hole and Hole Hiking. Having established prejudice resulting from the Park Service\u2019s arbitrary and capricious action, Eco Tour is entitled to judgment on the administrative record.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-4\">The court encourages the parties to resolve the bid preparation costs issue amicably, preferably by stipulation as to an amount due Eco Tour. If such a resolution is not achieved, Eco Tour must file a motion and accompanying brief in support of its request for bid preparation costs. The parties are directed to confer to determine how they wish to proceed with respect to determining the amount of bid preparation costs Eco Tour is entitled to receive in light of the court\u2019s resolution of this protest. The court also encourages the parties to explore and address the issue of attorney fees and costs in advance of any necessity to litigate that issue.

The Federal Circuit in <em>Blue &amp; Gold Fleet </em>did not address the issue of whether NPS concession contracts are procurement contracts subject to section 1491(b). This is unsurprising, given that <em>Blue &amp; Gold Fleet </em>was decided before <em>Resource Conservation, </em>which clarified that section 1491(b)(1) bid protest jurisdiction is limited to the procurement context. 597 F.3d at 1245. Because <em>Blue &amp; Gold Fleet </em>did not address the issue of the jurisdictional basis for bid protests involving NPS concession contracts, it is not dispositive of that issue here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b36-6\">. The court is mindful that, in procurements subject to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), the concept of responsiveness is generally confined to sealed bidding. <em>See Excel Mfg., Ltd. v. United States, </em>111 Fed.Cl. 800, 806 &amp; n. 3 (2013); <em>Dyonyx, L.P. v. United States, </em>83 Fed.Cl. 460, 468 (2008) (citations omitted). By contrast, \"[i]n negotiated procurements, a proposal that fails to conform to the material terms and conditions of the solicitation should be considered unacceptable and a contract award based on such an unacceptable proposal violates the procurement statutes and regulations.\u201d <em>E.W. Bliss Co. v. United States, </em>77 F.3d 445, 448 (Fed.Cir. 1996) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). As explained <em>supra, </em>solicitations for NPS concession contracts are not \"procurements\u201d subject to the FAR. Moreover, as the government correctly noted at oral argument, the NPS\u2019s determination of the \u201cresponsiveness\u201d of proposals for the disputed contracts is mandated by the particular regulations governing NPS concession contracts. Tr. at 53-54; <em>see also </em>36 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 51.27, 51.30-51.31. Accordingly, the aforementioned authorities confining the concept of responsiveness to sealed bidding are inapplicable in the unique context of NPS concession contracts.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b36-11\">. Eco Tour also argues that Jackson Hole's proposal was non-responsive because Jackson Hole did not submit a signed transmittal letter with its proposal as required by the prospectus. PL's Mot. at 14-15, 22-23; <em>see </em>AR Tab 4 at 27 (prospectus instructions stating that \"[failure to submit a signed Offeror\u2019s Transmittal Letter ... will make your proposal nonresponsive\u201d), 35 (proposal package stating that the transmittal letter \"indicates your acceptance of the terms and conditions of the concession opportunity as set forth in this Prospectus\u201d and \"must bear original signatures\u201d), Tab 20 at 638-40 (Jackson Hole's unsigned transmittal letter). However, after the filing of Eco Tour's motion, the government supplemented the AR to include a copy of the signed transmittal letter accompanying Jackson Hole\u2019s proposal. <em>See </em>AR Tab 46. Therefore, Eco Tour's additional responsiveness argument is unsupported by the record. Indeed, Eco Tour did not continue to advance that particular argument in either its reply brief or at oral argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b38-6\">. The only authority Eco Tour cites in support of its argument that it was not required to challenge paragraph 1 (d) before the close of bidding is <em>BayFirst Solutions, LLC v. United States, </em>102 Fed.Cl. 677, 681-82 (2012). <em>See </em>Pl.'s Mot. at 30 n.8. That case is inapposite because it did not involve a challenge to the terms of a solicitation. but rather a challenge to the agency\u2019s evaluation of proposals. Eco Tour\u2019s reliance upon the court\u2019s passing statement that a chart contained in the solicitation \"could, with effort, be harmonized with the weighting scheme presented on the previous page of the solicitation,\u201d <em>BayFirst, </em>102 Fed.Cl. at 681, is therefore fruitless.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b41-15\">. Additionally, even if defendant\u2019s case law were applicable, the government overreaches when it suggests that responsibility determinations are \"effectively unreviewable\u201d absent allegations of fraud or bad faith. Indeed, the government conceded so at oral argument by pointing the court to <em>Impresa Construzioni Geom. Domenico Garufi v. United States, </em>238 F.3d 1324 (Fed.Cir.2001), in which the Federal Circuit rejected an argument, virtually identical to that made by the government here, that \"absent allegations of fraud or bad faith,\u201d a responsibility determination is \"immune from judicial review.\u201d 238 F.3d at 1333; <em>see </em>Tr. at 55.
