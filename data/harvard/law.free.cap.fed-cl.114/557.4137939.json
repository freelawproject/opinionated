This opinion was issued under seal on January 13, 2014. On January 22, 2014, the parties filed a Joint Notice Regarding Proposed Redactions to Court\u2019s Opinion and Order, proposing one redaction.

Sentrillion contends that USMS erred in concluding that Sentrillion failed to satisfy the requirements for partnership agreements and business licenses. Additionally, Sentrillion contends that USMS treated Sentrillion and Tyco unequally, applied unstated evaluation criteria, and failed to conduct meaningful discussions. Claiming it was the lowest priced technically acceptable offeror, Sentrillion asks the Court to direct award to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>This matter comes before the Court on the parties\u2019 cross-motions for judgment on the administrative record (\u201cAR\u201d). Because Sen-trillion has failed to demonstrate that USMS\u2019s decision to award the contract to Tyco was improper, the Court grants Defendant\u2019s and Intervenor\u2019s cross-motions for judgment on the AR.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b572-4\">\n<em>Findings of Fact</em>\n<footnotemark>\n<em>3</em>\n</footnotemark>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">\n<em>The Solicitation</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">On April 5, 2012, USMS issued solicitation number DJMS-12-R-0011 seeking security services for approximately 900 judicial and USMS facilities throughout all 50 states and the organized United States territories. AR Tab 2 at 6,17. Specifically, the awardee was to \u201cprovide all management, supervision, manpower, materials, supplies, and equipment necessary to plan, schedule, coordinate, and assure effective performance of\u2019 security systems in judicial and USMS facilities. <em>Id. </em>at 11, 17. USMS sought security services in one or more of three geographical regions\u2014 Eastern, Central, and Western. <em>Id. </em>at 18. Any offeror who wished to bid on all three geographical regions could submit a nationwide proposal, in addition to proposals covering the separate regions. <em>Id. </em>at 137.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-7\">Offerors were to submit their proposals in the following five sections: (I) Certification Package, (II) Technical Submission, (III) Past Performance, (IV) Price Proposal, and (V) Business Proposal. <em>Id. </em>at 137-39. The Technical Submission section included six technical subfactors for evaluation: (1) Ability to Meet Response Requirements, (2) Asset Management, Project and Maintenance Management System, (3) Business Licenses, (4) Operational Program Team Qualifications, (5) Training, and (6) Corporate Experience. <em>Id. </em>at 137-38.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-8\">The solicitation called for the use of lowest price technically acceptable source selection in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (\u201cFAR\u201d) 15.101-2. <em>Id. </em>at 144; AR Tab 16 at 66379. As such, all the non-price sections would be rated as either \u201cAcceptable\u201d or \u201cUnacceptable.\u201d AR Tab 2 at 143-45. Only proposals rated \u201cAcceptable\u201d under all the nonprice factors would then be evaluated for price. <em>Id. </em>at 145. USMS would issue up to three regional Indefinite-Delivery/Indefinite-Quantity (\u201cIDIQ\u201d) contracts or one nationwide IDIQ contract to offerors with the \u201clowest evaluated price ... meeting or exceeding the acceptability standards for non-cost factors.\u201d <em>Id.; see also </em>AR Tab 16 at 66379.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-12\">\n<em>The Requirements for Business Licenses and Partnership Agreements</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b572-13\">Under the Technical Submission factor, the solicitation required offerors to submit business licenses, or an application for such licenses, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-14\">The Contractor must secure and maintain in a current status all required licenses and permits applicable to the lawful functioning within the locations listed in Attachments A, B, C and D [for the facilities covered under the solicitation in the Central Region, Eastern Region, Western Region, and Nationwide, respectively]\u2014Tab 6. In doing so, the Contractor must furnish evidence to the Contracting Officer of a company license (state and/or local) authorizing the company to provide security installation services within that state and/or locality, or evidence of application for same with [its] proposal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b572-15\">AR Tab 2 at 138. Amendment 1 to the solicitation expounded upon this requirement in a question-and-answer exchange, requiring \u201cevidence of a partnership\u201d from offerors planning on cooperating with other companies to provide services:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-16\">[Question:] According to the interpretation of the Licenses requirement stated [above], are you specifying that the contractor and its team member, which consist of other contractors are to provide its licenses? I would appreciate your prompt response to this question, so we can begin collecting the licenses from our other team members. Can you please clarify?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-17\">[Answer:] Yes, license information must be submitted as evidence that the Contractor is authorized to provide security installa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>tion services within the state and/or locality, or evidence of application for the same with their proposal. <em>If partnered with other companies to perform the work, then their license is to be submitted along with evidence of a partnership to provide services. </em>[Section] H-7 [of the solicitation] has been modified to remove the reference to \u201cpermits\u201d.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">AR Tab 3 at 8378 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">Amendment 3 to the solicitation revised the Business Licenses subfaetor further to add the following: \u201c[t]he Prime and any subcontractors are required to be licensed to provide security installation services in the states in which they propose to provide service under this contract. Offeror must furnish evidence of a company state license.\u201d AR Tab 5 at 17792. The solicitation contained no additional information concerning the need to provide \u201cevidence of partnership to provide services.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b573-7\">Under the Ability to Meet Response Requirements subfactor, the solicitation provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-8\">For each Regional and/or Nationwide submission, the USMS will evaluate the Offer- or\u2019s written narrative explaining how response times identified in the Statement of Work shall be met. The narrative must provide sufficient and convincing details that demonstrate the Offeror\u2019s ability to meet all response requirements identified. Failure to provide sufficient detail to enable the Government to thoroughly evaluate the Offeror\u2019s ability to satisfy the requirements specified may result in a rating of unacceptable and the proposal shall be excluded from further consideration.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b573-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 17805.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-10\">\n<em>Early Submission Rounds, Evaluation, and Discussions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b573-11\">On June 6, 2012, USMS received proposals from four offerors\u2014Sentrillion, Tyco, Die-bold, Incorporated (\u201cDiebold\u201d), and KS International (\u201cKSI\u201d)\u2014for each of the three geographic regions. AR Tab 47 at 70390; <em>see </em>AR Tab 19 at 67063. All offerors, except Sentrillion, submitted a nationwide proposal in this round. AR Tab 47 at 70390; see <em>also </em>AR Tab 19 at 67065-66. Because USMS amended the solicitation nine times after the submission of proposals, USMS called on offerors to submit revised proposals by October 12, 2012, if necessary. AR Tab 47 at 70390; <em>see also </em>AR Tabs 7-15. Both Sentrillion and Tyco submitted revised proposals. AR Tab 17e at 66919; AR Tab 48 at 70402.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-13\">In evaluating the technical subfaetors, the Technical Evaluation Board (\u201cTEB\u201d) found Tyco\u2019s proposals acceptable for all subfaetors in every geographical region. <em>See </em>AR Tab 19 at 67063-65. The TEB rated Sentrillion\u2019s proposals \u201cUnacceptable\u201d under the Business Licenses subfactor in all three regions, citing Sentrillion\u2019s failure to provide all required business licenses \u201cfor the prime or subeontractors/partners identified to perform services in each of the states and territories____\u201d AR Tab 18a at 66922; AR Tab 18b at 66970; AR Tab 18c at 67019; <em>see also </em>AR Tab 19 at 67063-64. In particular, \u201cSen-trillion had only provided one license per state and in each case it was for the first company listed.\u201d <em>See </em>AR Tab 25a at 67651; AR Tab 25b at 67695; AR Tab 25c at 67738. Specifically, Sentrillion had provided either one business license from itself\u2014without any subcontractor licenses\u2014or one license from a single subcontractor\u2014without licenses from others working in the location. <em>See, e.g., </em>AR Tab 17c at 66792-839. The TEB also rated Sentrillion\u2019s proposals \u201cUnacceptable\u201d under the \u201cOperational Program Team Qualifications\u201d technical subfactor in this round. AR Tab 19 at 67063-64.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-15\">On November 5, 2012, USMS decided to conduct discussions with all offerors in the competitive range. <em>Id. </em>at 67066. USMS concluded that Sentrillion was in the competitive range because Sentrillion could receive an \u201cAcceptable\u201d rating for all subfactors by providing additional information. <em>Id. </em>at 67065. After removing KSI from the competitive range based upon its rating of \u201cUnacceptable\u201d for \u201cPast Performance\u201d and \u201cCorporate Experience,\u201d USMS provided the remaining three offerors with discussion letters. <em>Id. </em>at 67065-66; <em>see also, e.g., </em>AR Tab 22 at 67086-90.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-16\">In its discussion letter regarding the Business Licenses subfactor, USMS informed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>Sentrillion that it failed to submit all the required business licenses, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-4\">Section H-7 of the Solicitation [as] further clarified in Amendments 0001 and 0003, requires the contractor to demonstrate the ability to provide security installation services in every state in the region by providing a current company license or the application for a company license for each state in the region. Furthermore, any subcontractors or partners identified as performing any part of the contract in a particular state must also provide a current company license or an application for a company license for that state.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">AR Tab 22 at 67089.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">On November 15, 2012, Sentrillion submitted its proposal revisions, and detailed the locations where Sentrillion proposed using team members. <em>E.cj., </em>AR Tab 24a at 67112; AR Tab 24b at 67269-70; AR Tab 24c at 67469. Tyco also submitted its proposal revisions on November 15, 2013. AR Tab 52a at 71956; AR Tab 52b at 72251; AR Tab 52c at 72536; AR Tab 52d at 72829. In its nationwide proposal revision, Tyco offered to use four subcontractors in five locations. AR Tab 52d at 72905. Three of the subcontractors submitted letters entitled \u201cEvidence of Contract to Provide Services\u201d explaining that they were \u201ccurrently under contract to provide maintenance and other security services\u201d as Tyeo\u2019s subcontractors. <em>Id. </em>at 73049, 73062, 73161. The remaining subcontractor [redacted] did not include a letter, but provided its business licenses for Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands. <em>Id. </em>at 73193-14, 73205.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-7\">The TEB found Sentrillion\u2019s proposals \u201cUnacceptable\u201d under the Ability to Meet Response Requirements and Business Licenses subfactors because Sentrillion failed to provide fully completed business license applications for many locations. AR Tab 25a at 67651-52; AR Tab 25b at 67695-96; AR Tab 25e at 67738-39. After eliminating Sen-trillion from the competition based on TEB\u2019s evaluation of Sentrillion\u2019s offer, USMS found that Tyco had an acceptable offer with the lowest price. AR Tab 28 at 67819-21, 67839; AR Tab 29 at 67480. On December 27, 2012, USMS awarded the contract to Tyco as the lowest priced technically acceptable offeror. AR Tab 47 at 70392; AR Tab 30 at 67841-42. <em>The GAO Protest</em></p>\n<p id=\"b574-9\">On January 11, 2013, Sentrillion filed a bid protest with the Government Accountability Office (\u201cGAO\u201d). AR Tab 47 at 70392. GAO sustained the protest, finding that USMS did not conduct meaningful discussions with Sen-trillion because USMS failed to raise its concerns with the completeness of some of Sen-trillion\u2019s business license applications. <em>Id. </em>at 70394-95. As such, GAO recommended that USMS reopen the bidding process, conduct meaningful discussions, permit offerors to submit revised proposals, and make a new source selection. <em>Id. </em>at 70398.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-10\">\n<em>The Reopening of the Competition</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b574-11\">On May 7, 2013, USMS reopened the competition and issued discussion letters to the offerors based on GAO\u2019s recommendation. AR Tab 40 at 70289; <em>see also </em>AR Tab 53; AR Tab 53a. The discussion letters sent to Sentrillion and Tyco both stated that \u201c[t]his letter constitutes the only discussions that will occur in accordance with FAR 15.306(d), as the USMS intends to make award without further revisions.\u201d AR Tab 53 at 73504; AR Tab 53a at 73506.2. In its letter to Sentrillion, under the Ability to Meet Response Requirements subfaetor, USMS explained that Sentrillion needed to provide a consistent narrative:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-12\">The information provided must be consistent throughout the narrative and not contradict information provided elsewhere. For instance, the Sentrillion Team listing of subeontraetors/partners should not differ from the partnering information, as a company state license or application for the same authorizing the company to provide security installation services within a location is required for all companies proposed to perform work under this contract.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b574-13\">AR Tab 53 at 73504. Further, under the Business Licenses subfactor, the letter required as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-14\">Sentrillion must submit a company state license authorizing the company to provide security installation services within that state or territory, or evidence of application for the same at the time of final <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>proposal revision. <em>If partnered with other companies to perform the work, then their license or application must be submitted along with evidence of a partnership agreement to provide services. License must be current, applications must contain all required information per the application instructions, and signed partnering agreements must be included at the time final proposals are submitted.... </em>Failure to provide the required information will result in a rating of unacceptable and the proposal shall be excluded from further consideration.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b575-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 73505 (emphasis added). USMS\u2019s discussion letter to Tyco provided the same language for the Business Licenses subfactor and included no additional information concerning the need for partnership agreements. AR Tab 53a at 73506.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">\n<em>Sentrillion\u2019s Proposals and Teaming Agreements</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">On May 30, 2013, Sentrillion submitted final revised proposals for each geographical region and, for the first time, a nationwide proposal, adding Diebold to its list of team members. AR Tab 37 at 68468-70; AR Tab 38c at 69175-76.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Sentrillion Team covered \u201cthe entire nation\u201d with team members in \u201ca range of two (2) to 50 miles ... from USMS facilities.\u201d AR Tab 38e at 69164. Sentrillion\u2019s proposals contained \u201cteaming agreements\u201d with its team members that provided the parties would enter into good faith negotiations to form a subcontract if Sentrillion were awarded the USMS contract. <em>Id. </em>at 69713-865. For example, the Sentrillion/Diebold teaming agreement stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-7\">As a result of the Procurement, if the Government awards a contract to Sentrillion, Sentrillion and Teaming Member will enter into good faith negotiations with the intent of entering into a mutually acceptable subcontract agreement. The Parties will undertake reasonable efforts that such subcontract agreement will incorporate the responsibilities identified in <em>Exhibit A </em>of this Agreement [providing a description of the services Diebold would perform], as amended. Notwithstanding, the Parties agree that the period for good faith negotiation of said subcontract agreement shall not exceed sixty (60) days from the date of award. Further, if Sentrillion and Teaming Member cannot reach an agreement within said period for negotiation, Sentrillion shall be free to contract with another source.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b575-11\"><em>Id. </em>at 69794. Sentrillion proposed using a total of 53 subcontractors to provide services throughout the United States, offering one or more subcontractors in every location covered by the solicitation. <em>Id. </em>at 69710-11, 69171-73. Diebold would provide Sentrillion support in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Guam, and Puerto Rico. Id. at 69711.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-12\">\n<em>Tyco\u2019s Proposals and Master Agreements</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b575-13\">Tyco submitted its final nationwide and regional proposals on May 30, 2013. AR Tabs 54a, 54b, 54c, 54d. In response to its discussion letter requiring \u201csigned partnering agreements\u201d as \u201cevidence of a partnership agreement to provide services,\u201d Tyco submitted four \u201cmaster agreements\u201d with its four proposed subcontractors. AR Tab 54d at 74639-46, 74654-62, 74741-51, 74785-95. Tyco proposed using subcontractors in Minnesota, Nebraska, the Virgin Islands, the Northern Mariana Islands, and Guam. <em>Id. </em>at 74502. In all other locations, Tyco offered to provide services itself. <em>See id. </em>at 74502, 74602-820. These master agreements controlled the ongoing relationship between Tyco and its subcontractors, including future work orders. For example, the November 1, 2012 subcontracting agreement covering Minnesota was to be renewed automatically every year and provided: \u201c[t]his Agreement shall operate as a master agreement and shall govern all present and future transactions entered into by Tyco ... and Subcontractor for the services described in this Agreement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 74639. Services covered by the master agreements encompassed the solicitation\u2019s installation, maintenance, and repair service requirements. <em>Compare id. </em>at 74639, 74654, 74741, 74785 <em>with </em>AR Tab 2 at 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>Statements of work (\u201cSOWs\u201d) would delineate future work requests under the master agreements, including any requests related to providing services for USMS. AR Tab 54d at 74639, 74654, 74741, 74785. The subcontracting agreement covering Minnesota, for example, provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-4\">Individual future requests for Subcontractor Services will be initiated by the issuance of [a] written SOW by an authorized Tyco representative and such transactions shall become effective when the SOW is accepted by Subcontractor. Subcontractor acknowledges and agrees that Tyco shall have no obligation to issue any SOWs or otherwise retain Subcontractor to provide goods or services.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">AR Tab 54d at 74639. The three other subcontracts included similar language to this provision but omitted the second sentence, stating: \u201c[individual future requests for Subcontractor Services will be initiated by the issuance of [a] written Work Order as defined in <em>Exhibit C </em>by an authorized ADT Service or Installation Manager and such transactions shall become effective when the Work Order is accepted by Subcontractor.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 74654, 74741, 74785. The master agreements provided the general terms and conditions of the subcontracting relationship, recognizing that SOWs from Tyco would define the specific services the subcontractor would provide. <em>See, e.g., id. </em>at 74639-46. The master agreements further provided that each subcontractor would be paid $100 \u201cfor its undertaking the obligation to perform,\u201d if the subcontractor never rendered services for Tyco. <em>Id. </em>at 74639, 74654, 74742, 74785.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">\n<em>The Evaluation</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b576-7\">The TEB found Sentrillion\u2019s proposals \u201cUnacceptable\u201d under the Ability to Meet Response Requirements and the Business Licenses technical subfactors. AR Tab 36 at 68445. Under the Ability to Meet Response Requirements subfactor, the TEB found that the lack of binding partnership agreements called into doubt Sentrillion\u2019s ability to satisfy the solicitation\u2019s requirements. For instance, the TEB\u2019s evaluation for the Eastern region noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-10\">However, the TEB found that none of the companies with which Sentrillion had entered into \u201cteaming agreements\u201d ([including] Diebold, upon which Sentrillion relies heavily to demonstrate its ability to meet response requirements) is legally committed to provide services in the event Sentrillion is awarded the contract. The teaming agreements submitted indicate nothing more than an \u201cagreement to negotiate.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b576-11\"><em>Id. </em>at 68448.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The TEB found all of Sentrillion\u2019s agreements with its subcontractors in every region nonbinding. <em>Id. </em>at 68445, 68448, 68455, 68462.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-12\">The TEB described why Sentrillion\u2019s submitted agreements were unacceptable to satisfy the solicitation\u2019s response time requirements and why finalized partnership agreements were necessary to meet the Ability to Meet Response Requirements subfactor, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-13\">All of these agreements permit the offeror to not engage the teaming member if, after specific periods of negotiation (45/60 days respectively), the parties fail to reach an agreement. This permits the offeror to \u201cbe free to contract with an alternate/another source.\u201d This may include companies not previously submitted nor found to be acceptable in meeting the distance and response requirements of the solicitation. Sentrillion relies heavily upon its potential \u201cteam\u201d members in attempting to demonstrate by convincing and sufficient evidence that it is capable of meeting the response requirements of Technical [Sub-factor] 1. Its purported \u201cregional footprint\u201d is [overwhelmingly] based upon vendors who are not contractually obligated to perform required services. On page 53 of its resubmission, Sentrillion states that \u201c[i]n most cases, Diebold, with its nationwide technical response capability and over 4,000 technicians readily available for dispatch, will serve as the primary dispatch support to service the USMS\u2019 facilities in Rl.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>In addition, the delay for Sentrillion to determine which technicians are going to be utilized will delay the transition period from the incumbent contractor. The information they have provided states they will be engaged in negotiations with their potential partner companies for up to the first 60 days following award (with no guarantee that an agreement will be reached). This crucial time is needed by the USMS to conduct the necessary background investigations of the personnel who will be performing under the contract---For all of these reasons, individually and taken together, the TEB has determined Sentrillion has not provided sufficient and convincing evidence that it alone will be capable of responding in a timely fashion to requests for service.

The discussion letter of May 7, 2013, stated that \u201c[i]f partnered with other companies to perform the work, then their license or application must be submitted along with evidence of a partnership agreement to provide services\u201d. Instead of providing partnership agreements, Sentrillion has provided purported \u201cteaming agreements\u201d that [are] merely \u201cagreements to negotiate\u201d with no guarantee that the proposed team member is ever going to be legally obligated to perform work under the contract.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-9\">The ... teaming agreements are merely agreements to enter into negotiations as opposed to agreements to partner with and provide services which are currently in force or executable upon award____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b577-11\"><em>Id. </em>at 68450-51 (first alteration in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b577-12\">The TEB also found that the solicitation required Sentrillion to provide its own business licenses for every state and territory, not just in the states where Sentrillion proposed to do work itself. The TEB stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-13\">The intent of requiring the prime to be licensed in every state and for partnership agreements to be submitted in addition to licenses for any subcontractors proposed was for the offeror to demonstrate the ability to provide the services required in the solicitation in the defined region.

Additionally, Sentrillion contends that USMS treated Sentrillion and Tyco unequally, applied unstated evaluation criteria, and failed to conduct meaningful discussions.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-13\">\n<em>The Requirement for Partnership Agreements</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b578-14\">Sentrillion alleges that USMS improperly concluded that its teaming agreements did not meet the requirement for \u201cevidence of a partnership\u201d in the form of a \u201csigned partnering agreement.\u201d Pl.\u2019s Mot. for Judgment on the AR (\u201cPl.\u2019s Mot.\u201d) 12-16. According to Sentrillion, the term \u201cpartnership agreement\u201d or \u201cpartnering agreement\u201d reasonably encompassed its agreements to negotiate subcontracting agreements if it were awarded the USMS contract. <em>Id. </em>at 14-15.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-15\">Sentrillion\u2019s interpretation of the requirement is untenable. The solicitation asked for evidence of partnerships to provide services if an offeror partnered with other companies under the Business Licenses sub-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>factor. AR Tab 3 at 8378. USMS\u2019s May 7, 2013 discussion letters explained that to satisfy this requirement, offerors needed to provide \u201csigned partnering agreements\u201d at the time final proposals were submitted. AR Tab 53 at 73505; AR Tab 53a at 73506.2. This requirement was clear; it mandated actual agreements to provide services\u2014not preliminary agreements to negotiate that could later evaporate. AR Tab 53 at 73505; <em>see also </em>AR Tab 53a at 73506.2; <em>cf. LaSalle Partners v. United States, </em>48 Fed.Cl. 797, 804-05 (2001) (finding that plaintiffs\u2019 letter expressing an intent to form a joint venture upon being awarded the contract failed to meet the solicitation\u2019s requirement for an \u201cexecuted joint venture agreement\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b579-4\">The indeterminate agreements to negotiate that Sentrillion proffered as \u201cteaming agreements\u201d are a far cry from \u201csigned partnering agreements.\u201d For example, Sentrillion\u2019s teaming agreement with Diebold\u2014the proposed subcontractor on which Sentrillion most heavily relied\u2014stated that the parties would enter into \u201cgood faith negotiations with the intent of entering into a mutually acceptable subcontract agreement\u201d if Sentrillion were awarded the contract. AR Tab 38e at 69794; <em>see also id. </em>at 69710-865. This agreement\u2019s nonbinding nature was plain, providing: \u201cif Sentrillion and Teaming Member cannot reach an agreement within said period for negotiation [60 days], Sentrillion shall be free to contract with another source.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 69794. The teaming agreements provided no assurance that team members would actually perform any services or that any particular subcontractor\u2014 whose licenses or applications had been provided\u2014would carry out services in a given location.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">Sentrillion also claims the Government\u2019s interpretation of the \u201cpartnership agreement\u201d requirement was arbitrary and capricious, arguing that agencies \u201croutinely\u201d permit offerors to submit teaming agreements. While Sentrillion characterizes its agreements as teaming agreements\u2014an undefined term in this procurement\u2014what constitutes an acceptable agreement depends on the solicitation\u2019s stated requirements. Here, by offering agreements to negotiate, Sentrillion ignored the solicitation and discussion letter requirement for evidence of partnerships in the form of signed partnering agreements.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-8\">Sentrillion further contends that USMS speculated that Sentrillion would not succeed in negotiating subcontracts with its team members. PL\u2019s Mot. 19. In so arguing, Sentrillion ignores the fundamental precept that it is an offeror\u2019s responsibility to demonstrate that its proposals comply with the solicitation\u2019s mandatory requirements to be technically acceptable. <em>L-3 Global Commc\u2019ns Solutions v. United States, </em>82 Fed.Cl. 604, 609 (2008) (citing <em>E.W. Bliss Co. v. United States, </em>77 F.3d 445, 448-49 (Fed. Cir.1996)).</p>\n<p id=\"b579-9\">Sentrillion also argues that USMS arbitrarily and capriciously considered Sentrillion\u2019s agreements with its subcontractors in rating its proposals \u201cUnacceptable\u201d under the Ability to Meet Response Requirements subfactor. Plaintiffs contention lacks merit. Under the Ability to Meet Response Requirements subfaetor, USMS sought \u201csufficient and convincing details\u201d concerning the offeror\u2019s ability to meet response times to perform security services. AR Tab 5 at 17805. USMS asked for a \u201cwritten narrative explaining how response times identified in the Statement of Work shall be met.\u201d <em>Id. </em>USMS warned offerors that \u201c[fjailure to provide sufficient detail to enable the Government to thoroughly evaluate the ... requirements specified may result in a rating of unacceptable____\u201d <em>Id. </em>In its nationwide proposal, Sentrillion explained that it would meet the response times in each geographical region using its \u201cteam\u201d of subcontractors. AR Tab 38c at 69163. Sentrillion claimed that \u201c[d]ue to [the team\u2019s] proximity to each USMS facility ... the Sentrillion Team has the resource capability to respond to the USMS\u2019[s] needs within the response requirements.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 69164. Because Sentrillion relied so heavily on subcontractors to perform the work, USMS reasonably considered Sentrillion\u2019s relationship with its partners to evaluate Sentrillion\u2019s ability to meet response times. <em>Id. </em>at 69710-11.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The agency ration<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>ally concluded that due to Sentrillion\u2019s lack of binding partnership agreements, it did not demonstrate that it had a team in place that could meet the response times. AR Tab 36 at 68448-49, 68455-56, 68462-63.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-4\">Finally, Sentrillion contends that USMS\u2019s interpretation of the solicitation and May 7, 2013 discussion letters as requiring binding subcontracting agreements was unduly restrictive and unreasonable given that pricing could become obsolete or a subcontractor\u2019s small business status could change between the time of proposal and award. PL\u2019s Mot. 17. This requirement, however, clearly had a rational relationship to the agency\u2019s needs. <em>See ABF Freight Sys., Inc. v. United States, </em>55 Fed.Cl. 392, 395 (2003) (citing <em>XTRA Lease, Inc. v. United States, </em>50 Fed.Cl. 612, 624 (2001)). By requiring finalized \u201cpartnering agreements,\u201d USMS could verify the identities of the companies set to perform security services in judicial and USMS facilities, ensure that all subcontractors were properly licensed to perform security services, and prevent an offeror from adding unapproved and unlicensed subcontractors post-award. <em>See, e.g., </em>AR Tab 36 at 68452. An agency rationally may ask to know who will be providing services under a contract, especially a contract for security services. <em>See Beretta USA Corp., </em>B-406376, 2013 CPD \u00b6 186, 2013 WL 4431830, at *5 (Comp.Gen. July 12, 2013) (finding that an agency\u2019s decision to treat protester\u2019s teaming agreements as a deficiency was rational where the teaming agreements \u201cdid not provide a level of commitment to verify\u201d performance of the contract). As such, USMS\u2019s interpretation of the solicitation and May 7, 2013 discussion letters was reasonable and not unduly restrictive.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">\n<em>Sentrillion\u2019s Claim of an Unstated Evaluation Factor</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">Sentrillion contends that requiring binding subcontracting agreements was an unstated evaluation factor. To succeed in this argument, Sentrillion must show the procuring agency used a substantially different basis in evaluating its proposals than was disclosed, and that, as a result, the protester was prejudiced because it had a substantial chance to receive the award but for this hidden evaluation criterion. <em>Banknote Corp. of America, Inc. v. United States, </em>56 Fed.Cl. 377, 387 (2003), <em>aff'd, </em>365 F.3d 1345 (Fed.Cir.2004); <em>NEQ, LLC v. United States, </em>88 Fed.Cl. 38, 48 (2009). Here, under the Business Licenses subfactor, USMS announced the need for partnering agreements in the solicitation, requesting \u201cevidence of a partnership to provide services.\u201d AR Tab 3 at 8378. In the May 7, 2013 discussion letters, USMS explained that requirement and asked for \u201csigned partnering agreements\u201d as \u201cevidence of a partnership agreement to provide services.\u201d AR Tab 53 at 73505; AR Tab 53a at 73506.2; <em>see also </em>AR Tab 3 at 8378. The requirement for binding partnership agreements was a clearly and expressly stated evaluation criterion.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-8\">\n<em>Sentrillion\u2019s Allegation of Unequal Treatment</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b580-9\">Sentrillion argues that USMS\u2019s acceptance of Tyeo\u2019s \u201cmaster agreements,\u201d but not Sentrillion\u2019s \u201cteaming agreements,\u201d constituted unequal treatment. It is well established that the agency must treat all offerors equally and consistently apply evaluation factors. <em>E.g., Banknote Corp., </em>56 Fed.Cl. at 383 (\u201c[The] contracting agency must treat all offerors equally, evaluating proposals evenhandedly against common requirements and evaluation criteria.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b580-10\">In arguing that USMS treated Sentrillion and Tyco unequally, Sentrillion contends that the agency improperly found Tyco compliant with the requirement for binding partnership agreements even though Tyco did not have binding agreements with its subcontractors. Sentrillion focuses on isolated language in Tyeo\u2019s master agreement and ignores the context of Tyco\u2019s established relationships with its four subcontractors under continuing agreements.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-11\">Sentrillion seizes on the following language in Tyco\u2019s master agreement with its subcontractor in Minnesota:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-12\">[I]ndividual future requests for Subcontractor Services will be initiated by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>issuance of [a] written SOW by an authorized Tyco representative and such transactions shall become effective when the SOW is accepted by Subcontractor. Subcontractor acknowledges and agrees that Tyco shall have no obligation to issue any SOWs or otherwise retain Subcontractor to provide goods or services.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">AR Tab 54d at 74639; <em>see also id. </em>at 74654, 74741, 74785. Because the \u201ctransactions\u201d or \u201cthe work\u201d the subcontractor was to perform under the solicitation would not \u201cbecome effective\u201d until the subcontractor accepted the SOW, Sentrillion contends that the subcontractor could walk away and, thus, Tyco\u2019s master agreements were equally as nonbinding as Sentrillion\u2019s teaming agreements.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">In suggesting that Tyeo\u2019s subcontractors could reject SOWs, Sentrillion selectively reads the Tyco agreements\u2019 language too narrowly and ignores the context of Tyco\u2019s ongoing relationships with its subcontractors. The provision does not say a transaction under an SOW will become effective \u201cif\u2019 the SOW is accepted by the subcontractor; it says a transaction will become effective \u201cwhen\u201d the SOW is accepted by the subcontractor. As such, the master agreements\u2019 description of the initiation of requests for \u201cSubcontractor Services\u201d could reasonably be read\u2014as the agency did\u2014as setting out the protocol for ordering services and the timing of subcontractor acceptance. Such a reading is consistent with the absence of any provision\u2014like that in Sentrillion\u2019s agreements\u2014 suggesting what would happen in the event the subcontractor refused the work. The potential for Tyco\u2019s subcontractors refusing an SOW and being replaced by some undisclosed entity was not mentioned in Tyco\u2019s master agreements, but such a scenario was clearly set forth in Sentrillion\u2019s teaming agreements.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-7\">The agency\u2019s reading of Tyeo\u2019s agreements is also compatible with the recognition that the agreements governed ongoing relationships between Tyco and its subcontractors. Tyco\u2019s master agreements for subcontracting services with each of its four proposed subcontractors contained the general terms and conditions governing the relationship between Tyco and its subcontractors, referencing upcoming SOWs from Tyco that would delineate the specific services to be provided by the subcontractors. <em>Id. </em>at 74639-46, 74654-62, 74741-51, 74785-95. The agreement covering Minnesota, for example, provided that it would \u201cgovern all present and future transactions entered into by Tyco ... and Subcontractor for the services described in this Agreement____\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 74639; <em>see also id. </em>at 74654, 74741, 74785. Services covered by the master agreements included services encompassed by the solicitation\u2014 \u201cinstallation, inspection, security guard response or patrol, equipment repair, and/or maintenance services____\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 74639, 74654, 74741, 74785. This express recognition that orders would be ongoing under this continuing relationship supports a reading that SOWs would routinely become effective upon signing by the subcontractor as a matter of procedure, not a reading that the subcontractor would have a contractual right to reject work, leaving Tyco to secure a replacement. In this vein, Tyeo\u2019s agreements expressly provided that if contract termination occurred before the subcontractor provided services, the subcontractor would be paid $100 \u201cfor its undertaking the obligation to perform.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 74639, 74654, 74742, 74785. This language demonstrates that each Tyco subcontractor had undertaken \u201cthe obligation to perform\u201d by virtue of its master agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-13\">Further, the record indicates Tyco\u2019s subcontractors believed they were \u201ccurrently under contract\u201d to perform. In the pre-GAO protest submission round, three subcontractors submitted letters entitled \u201cEvidence of Contract to Provide Services\u201d stating that they were \u201ccurrently under contract to provide maintenance and other security services\u201d as Tyeo\u2019s subcontractors. AR Tab 52d at 73049, 73062, 73161.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-14\">In sum, because Sentrillion\u2019s agreements to negotiate with its subcontractors were substantially different than Tyco\u2019s master agreements with its subcontractors, Sentrillion has not demonstrated that USMS treated these offerors unequally. <em>See NCL Logistics Co. v. United States, </em>109 Fed.Cl. 596, 627 (2013) (rejecting plaintiffs argument of unequal treatment in responsibility determina<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>tion where plaintiffs past performance record was not similar to that of offeror deemed responsible).</p>\n<p id=\"b582-4\">\n<em>Meaningful Discussions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">Under the FAR, the contracting officer must \u201cdiscuss with ... each offeror still being considered for award, deficiencies, significant weaknesses, and adverse past performance information to which the offeror has not yet had an opportunity to respond.\u201d FAR 15.306(d)(3) (2012). Discussions are intended to \u201clead offerors into the areas of their proposals which require amplification____\u201d <em>CACI Field Servs., Inc. v. United States, </em>13 Cl.Ct. 718, 731 (1987) (emphasis omitted) (quoting <em>Furuno U.S.A., Inc., </em>B-221814, 86-1 CPD \u00b6 400, 1986 WL 63429, at *3 (Comp.Gen. Apr. 24, <em>1986)), aff'd, </em>854 F.2d 464 (Fed.Cir.1988). However, \u201cagencies are not obligated to conduct all-encompassing discussions, that is, to address in express detail all inferior or inadequate aspects of a proposal____\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Furuno U.S.A., Inc., </em>1986 WL 63429, at *3). \u201cThe substance of the requirement is that the protestor should be given at least one meaningful opportunity to respond to significant weaknesses.\u201d <em>Orea Nw. Real Estate Servs. v. United States, </em>65 Fed.Cl. 1, 9 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b582-10\">Sentrillion argues that discussions were not meaningful because the agency never told Sentrillion that it had to submit binding subcontract agreements or that teaming agreements would be unacceptable under the Business Licenses and Ability to Meet Response Requirements subfactors. The record does not support this contention. Following GAO\u2019s decision recommending that USMS reopen the competition, USMS sent discussion letters to offerors in the competitive range, including Sentrillion and Tyco, and identified proposal elements that offerors had to address in final proposal revisions. AR Tab 53 at 73503-06; AR Tab 53a at 73506.1-06.4; <em>see also </em>AR Tab 47 at 70398. For each proposal section and technical sub-factor, USMS explained the agency\u2019s preGAO bid protest evaluation and indicated whether the offeror needed to amend any section or subfactor in its proposal revisions to obtain an acceptable rating in the next evaluation round. AR Tab 53 at 73504-06; AR Tab 53a at 73506.2-06.3.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-14\">In addressing the Business Licenses sub-factor, the discussion letters to Sentrillion and Tyco adequately conveyed the need for finalized agreements with team members, stating: \u201c[i]f partnered with other companies to perform the work, then their license or application must be submitted along with evidence of a partnership agreement to provide services\u201d and that \u201csigned partnering agreements must be included at the time final proposals are submitted.\u201d AR Tab 53 at 73505; AR Tab 53a at 73506.2. Because the May 7, 2013 discussion letters explicated the requirement for \u201cevidence of partnership,\u201d notifying offerors that only \u201csigned partnering agreements\u201d were acceptable, further discussions were not necessary to explain this requirement.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Moreover, in the May 7, 2013 discussion letters, USMS specifically told offerors: \u201c[t]his letter constitutes the only discussions that will occur in accordance with FAR 15.306(d), as the USMS intends to make award without further revisions.\u201d AR Tab 53 at 73504; AR Tab 53a at 73506.2. Thus, Sentrillion was on notice that no further discussions would be held and that offerors had to submit signed partnering agreements to meet the solicitation\u2019s requirements.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b583-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">1.

These findings of fact are derived from the Administrative Record.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b575-8\">. After the GAO protest, Diebold decided to team with Sentrillion rather than submit its own propos\u00e1is.

Each individual regional evaluation\u2014Eastern, Central, and Western regions\u2014provided the same explanation for unacceptability.

In the pre-GAO bid protest round, neither Sen-trillion nor Tyco had provided actual partnering agreements.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b582-12\">. Plaintiff also contends that USMS\u2019s finding that Sentrillion had to provide licenses in all states and territories, irrespective of whether Sentrillion itself proposed to perform work in the location, was inconsistent with the evaluation criteria. Pl.\u2019s Mot. 21. Even if the Court were to agree with this argument, Sentrillion has not shown that this error was prejudicial. <em>See Bannum, Inc. v. United States, </em>404 F.3d 1346, 1353 (Fed.Cir.2005). Any such error would not have prejudiced Sentrillion because USMS rationally determined Sentrillion\u2019s proposals to be unacceptable for failing to meet the Business Licenses and Ability to Meet Response Requirements technical subfactors. <em>See Statistica, Inc. v. Christopher, </em>102 F.3d 1577, 1583 (Fed.Cir.1996) (finding that bidder was not prejudiced where it could not establish a \u201creasonable likelihood\u201d of being awarded the contract, had the error not been committed).</p>\n<p id=\"b582-16\">Sentrillion also quibbles with the agency\u2019s articulated concerns with other areas of Sentril<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>lion\u2019s proposals which had been deemed acceptable before final proposal revisions, noting that it was unable to make changes in the final round to areas previously found acceptable. Pl.\u2019s Mot. 32-35. The agency did note that given the wholesale changes in Sentrillion\u2019s final proposal revisions, it was unclear whether Sentrillion and its partners could still meet previously acceptable areas. But these comments are of no moment here. The agency\u2019s venting of these concerns does not alter the reasonableness of the agency\u2019s rejection of Sentrillion\u2019s proposals for lack of binding partnership agreements.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
