Hitkansut contends that Dr. Ludtka and Oak Ridge hosted Ms. Walker as a guest researcher from 2003 through 2005 and that they then held discussions about a collaborative research effort, during which Ms. Walker disclosed her inventive process to Oak Ridge employees. <em>See </em>Pis.\u2019 Br. at 4. No collaborative research agreement came to fruition. <em>Id. </em>Hitkansut alleges that Oak Ridge improperly used Ms. Walker\u2019s process as the basis for a patent, No. 7,161,124, the application for which was filed in April 2005 and which was granted on January 9, 2007. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 22-25.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Hitkansut also alleges that Oak Ridge\u2019s later activities, including continued research with regard to \u201cthermomagnetie processing,\u201d allegedly was funded in part by agreements with private parties who are beginning to use the process commercially.

The parties submitted briefs on claim construction and presented arguments at a <em>Markman </em>hearing held on May 2, 2013. Of the twenty-one claim terms identified by parties, only two have an agreed-upon construction. <em>See </em>Pis.\u2019 Br. at 11-12.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> For those two terms, the court accepts the mutually acceptable constructions proffered by the parties. The constructions adopted by the court for the disputed terms of the \u2019722 patent are set forth below.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-13\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b427-14\">A. <em>Standards for Construction</em></p>\n<p id=\"b427-15\">\u201cThe purpose of claim construction is to \u2018determin[e] the meaning and scope of the patent claims asserted to be infringed.\u2019 \u201d <em>02 Micro Int\u2019l Ltd. v. Beyond Innovation Tech. Co., </em>521 F.3d 1351, 1360 (Fed.Cir.2008) (quoting <em>Markman v. Westview Instruments, Inc., </em>52 F.3d 967, 976 (Fed.Cir.1995) (en banc), <em>aff'd, </em>517 U.S. 370, 116 S.Ct. 1384, 134 L.Ed.2d 577 (1996)). The construction and meaning of claims in a patent are questions of law for the court to address. <em>Markman, </em>517 U.S. at 388-90, 116 S.Ct. 1384. The trial court is not required to construe every term in a patent, but it must construe any term for which claim scope is disputed. <em>02 Micro, </em>521 F.3d at 1360-61; <em>see also Finjan, Inc. v. Secure Computing Corp., </em>626 F.3d 1197, 1207 (Fed.Cir.2010). The court should first look to the intrinsic evidence of record, as \u201cintrinsic evidence is the most significant source of the legally operative meaning of disputed claim language.\u201d <em>Vitronics Corp. v. Conceptronic, Inc., </em>90 F.3d 1576, 1582 (Fed.Cir. 1996). Intrinsic evidence consists of the \u201cpatent itself, including the claims, the specification[,] and ... the prosecution history.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Markman, </em>52 F.3d at 979).</p>\n<p id=\"b427-16\">To construe claim terms properly, a court should generally look to the ordinary and customary meanings attributed by those of ordinary skill in the art at the date of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>invention, which is the effective filing date of the patent application. <em>Phillips v. AWH Corp., </em>415 F.3d 1303, 1313 (Fed.Cir.2005) (en banc). \u201cThat starting point is based on the well-settled understanding that inventors are typically persons skilled in the field of the invention and that patents are addressed to and intended to be read by others of skill in the pertinent art.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Courts have recognized, however, that \u201ca patentee may choose to be his own lexicographer and use terms in a manner other than their ordinary meaning, as long as the special definition of the term is clearly stated in the patent specification or file history.\u201d <em>Vitronics, </em>90 F.3d at 1582 (citing <em>Hoechst Celanese Corp. v. BP Chems. Ltd., </em>78 F.3d 1575, 1578 (Fed.Cir.1996)); <em>Hormone Research Found., Inc. v. Genentech, Inc., </em>904 F.2d 1558, 1563 (Fed.Cir.1990), <em>cert. dismissed pursuant to Sup.Ct. R. 16, </em>499 U.S. 955, 111 S.Ct. 1434, 113 L.Ed.2d 485 (1991). Therefore, a court must review the patent\u2019s specification \u201cto determine whether [an] inventor has used any terms in a manner inconsistent with their ordinary meaning.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Prosecution history may also be examined, with its principal purpose being to exclude interpretations disclaimed during prosecution. <em>Chimie v. PPG Indus., Inc., </em>402 F.3d 1371, 1384 (Fed.Cir.2005); <em>Vitronics, </em>90 F.3d at 1582-83.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">Extrinsic evidence, which includes \u201call evidence external to the patent and prosecution history, including expert and inventor testimony, dictionaries, and learned treatises,\u201d <em>Markman, </em>52 F.3d at 980, is \u201cless significant than the intrinsic record\u201d in the construction process, <em>Phillips, </em>415 F.3d at 1317 (quoting <em>C.R. Bard, Inc. v. United States Surgical Corp., </em>388 F.3d 858, 862 (Fed.Cir. 2004)). It should be considered by the court only when intrinsic evidence cannot be used to resolve ambiguities in the claim language. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">B. <em>Specific Terms of the Claims Requiring Construction</em></p>\n<p id=\"b428-7\">\n<em>Term I: \u201cStructure.\"</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b428-8\">Plaintiffs\u2019 Proposed Claim Construction_</p>\n<p id=\"AcW\">Government\u2019s Proposed Claim Construction</p>\n<p id=\"AB9\">Means a solid manufactured part.</p>\n<p id=\"A6d\">Means any physical object that is capable of being changed by multiple energy processes applied concurrently; the workpiece to which claimed invention is</p>\n<p id=\"b428-11\">Term 1 appears in independent Claims 1, 7, 11, 12, and 14. The court must adopt a construction of the term which encompasses all such uses. <em>See Phillips, </em>415 F.3d at 1314 (\u201cBecause claim terms are normally used consistently throughout the patent, the usage of a term in one claim can often illuminate the meaning of the same term in other claims.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b428-12\">Both parties\u2019 proposed constructions are somewhat problematic. Under the government\u2019s definition, \u201cany solid material,] whether formed or not,\u201d would constitute a structure. Def.\u2019s Principal Claim Constr. Br. (\u201cDef.\u2019s Br.\u201d) at 16, ECF No. 20. This definition encompasses naturally occurring materials, such as rocks, putting it at odds with the ordinary meaning of the word \u201cstructure,\u201d which shares a Latin root meaning to build with the active verb \u201cconstruct.\u201d The use of the term \u201cstructure\u201d in the patent specification accordingly contemplates manufactured or constructed objects. <em>See </em>\u2019722 patent, col. 5, lines 17-20 (\u201cThe invention finds particular utility in association with stress relieving structures such as manufactured parts, assemblies of multiple parts, welds, or other structures.\u201d). Additionally, the plaintiffs\u2019 proffered construction, although more on point than defendant\u2019s construction, fails to include a limit apparent throughout the specification\u2014namely, that the claimed invention must be applied to the manufactured or constructed object being addressed. <em>See, e.g., </em>\u2019722 patent, col. 1, lines 16-19.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-14\">For the reasons stated, the court adopts an amalgam of the parties\u2019 proffered definitions of Term 1: \u201cstructure\u201d means a physical object that has been constructed or manufactured and to which the claimed invention is applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>\n<em>Term 2: \u201cEnergy.\"</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">Plaintiffs\u2019 Proposed Claim Construction</p>\n<p id=\"Ape\">Government\u2019s Proposed Claim Construction</p>\n<p id=\"AIl\">Means a type of work or heat.</p>\n<p id=\"AWvm\">Means a specific source or sources of energy that can be applied to structure, such as thermal, microwave, solar, nuclear, etc. Further, as used in the claims, energy is not limited to any specific source in particular, but includes all sources.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-9\">Term 2 appears in Claims 1, 7, 11, 12, and 14. Plaintiffs\u2019 proposed construction, \u201ca type of work or heat,\u201d approaches the ordinary and customary meaning of energy, as understood by those of ordinary skill in the art. The addition of the words \u201cor heat,\u201d however, is redundant, as heat is simply a form of energy. The government\u2019s definition is helpful insofar as it appropriately notes that, as used in the patent, \u201cenergy\u201d is applied to affect a structure. Such a notation comports with the patent specification, which states that \u201c[t]he first and second energy types may individually be any form of energy applied to a structure.\u201d \u2019722 patent, col. 3, lines 10-11.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The government\u2019s list of energy sources, however, is cumbersome and unnecessary because the government\u2019s proposed claim construction itself postulates that \u201cas used in the claims, energy is not limited to any specific source in particular, but includes all sources.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b429-10\">At the <em>Markman </em>hearing, the government contended that \u201cenergy\u201d in the context of the patent necessarily had to refer to two different <em>types </em>of energy being applied concurrently. <em>See </em>Hr\u2019g Tr. 20:9 to 21:2 (\u201c[A]ll that we\u2019re trying to get to here is that in writing the patent, they talk about a first energy, a second energy, different\u2014two energies being different.\u201d). This contention is not reflected in the government\u2019s proffered claim construction, but the court will nonetheless consider it.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-11\">The general \u201cdoctrine of claim differentiation \u2018create[s] a presumption that each claim in a patent has a different scope.\u2019 \u201d <em>Versa Corp. v. Ag-Bag Int\u2019l Ltd., </em>392 F.3d 1325, 1330 (Fed.Cir.2004) (quoting <em>Comark Commc\u2019ns, Inc. v. Harris Corp., </em>156 F.3d 1182, 1187 (Fed.Cir.1998)). Although the Federal Circuit has cautioned that \u201cthe claim differentiation tool works best in the relationship between independent and dependent claims,\u201d it has also noted that, when applied with respect to two independent claims, \u201cclaim differentiation takes on relevance in the context of a claim construction that would render additional, or different, language in another independent claim superfluous.\u201d <em>Curtiss-Wright Flow Control Corp. v. Velan, Inc., </em>438 F.3d 1374, 1380-81 (Fed.Cir.2006); <em>see also Arlington Indus., Inc. v. Bridgeport Fittings, Inc., </em>632 F.3d 1246, 1254 (Fed.Cir.2011). Within the \u2019722 patent, independent Claim 1 specifically identifies that the first and second energies mentioned are \u201cdifferent\u201d and are of different types, <em>i.e., </em>the first is \u201cthermal\u201d and the second is \u201coscillatory.\u201d <em>See </em>\u2019722 patent, Claim 1, col. 19, lines 43-67. Conversely, independent Claim 14 does not state that the first and second energies are different or of divergent types. <em>See </em>\u2019722 patent, Claim 14, col. 22, lines 37-64. Reading a limitation requiring different types or sources of \u201cenergy\u201d into that term would render superfluous the modifiers used in Claim 1, and the limitation will not be adopted. In short, the claims do require that at least two different energy processes be employed, but not that they always be of different types.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-17\">For the reasons above, the court adopts the following construction of Term 2: \u201cenergy\u201d means the capacity to do work by various means, here, specifically, the capacity or capability to act on a structure.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number><em>Term 3: \"Energy </em>process.\"</p>\n<p id=\"b430-4\">Plaintiffs\u2019 Proposed Claim Construction</p>\n<p id=\"APJ\">Government\u2019s Proposed Claim Construction</p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">Means a method of imparting a type of work or heat to the structure which is not normally present._</p>\n<p id=\"A7s\">Means a process that can provide energy of a specific type and apply that energy or energy source to the structure.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-8\">Term 3 appears in Claims 1, 7, 11, and 14. The reasoning outlined in the discussion of Term 2 is applicable here, and therefore the use of plaintiffs\u2019 proposed phrasing\u2014\u201ca method of imparting a type of work\u201d\u2014is appropriate. As discussed <em>supra, </em>the type of work must also be applied to a structure. The second aspect of plaintiffs\u2019 proposed construction, referring to a type of work \u201cwhich is not normally present,\u201d could create confusion or ambiguity regarding what may be classified as \u201cnormal.\u201d Plaintiffs argue that this qualifying phrase is needed because a structure \u201csitting in ambient conditions is technically subject to several energies such as room temperature, light radiation, gravity, the earth\u2019s magnetic field, and the like.\u201d Pis.\u2019 Br. at 18. The court rejects this argument, because \u201cimpart\u201d is itself an active verb carrying a connotation of affirmative transmission of its subject. Furthermore, the exclusion of certain ambient sources of energy is addressed in the construction of Term 12, <em>infra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b430-10\">The court draws upon plaintiffs\u2019 proffered construction to conclude that Term 3 means a method of imparting a type of work to a structure.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-11\"><em>Term 4: \u201cOperational setting.</em>\"</p>\n<p id=\"b430-12\">Plaintiffs\u2019 Proposed Claim Construction</p>\n<p id=\"AMK\">Government\u2019s Proposed Claim Construction</p>\n<p id=\"b430-14\">Means an adjustable characteristic of the energy process other than time.</p>\n<p id=\"AvW\">Means a generic term that encompasses any setting, other than time, that may be required to cause tire energy process to impart energy to the structure.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-16\">Term 4 appears in Claims 1, 7, 8, 9,10,11, 12, and 14. Once again, both parties\u2019 proffered constructions fall short in accurately capturing the meaning of the term. Plaintiffs\u2019 proposed construction does not accurately convey the interplay between an operational setting and the energy process, as described by the language of the claims themselves and the patent specification. <em>See, e.g., </em>\u2019722 patent, Claim 1, col. 19, lines 45-46 (\u201cproviding a first energy to a structure by performing a first energy process <em>according </em>to an operational setting\u201d) (emphasis added); <em>id. </em>at col. 3, line 53 to col. 4, line 8; <em>id. </em>at col. 7, lines 14-23. In particular, plaintiffs\u2019 use of the word \u201ccharacteristic\u201d does not evoke a setting that guides the energy process, as the specification connotes. \u2019722 patent, col. 3, lines 53-56 (\u201c[A] method is provided for determining operational settings for concurrent application of multiple energy types to a structure.\u201d). The government is correct that the patentee, acting as her own lexicographer, has specially defined \u201coperational setting,\u201d Def.\u2019s Br. at 19 (citing <em>Vitronics, </em>90 F.3d at 1582); however, the government\u2019s proposed construction based upon the usage of the term in the specification is vague and of limited assistance in understanding the scope of the claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-18\">Both parties\u2019 constructions correctly exclude time from the meaning of Term 4, because paired references to the \u201coperational setting and a time value\u201d appear throughout the patent. <em>See, e.g., </em>\u2019722 patent, Claim 1, col. 19, line 47; <em>id. </em>at Claim 7, col. 20, line 59; <em>see also id. </em>at Claim 8, col. 21, lines 27-28; <em>id. </em>at Claim 11, col. 21, line 57.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-19\">For the stated reasons, the court adopts the following construction for Term 4: \u201coperational setting\u201d means a set point, other than time, that guides or governs the application of the energy process.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>\n<em>Term 5: \u201cFirst order rate relationship.\"</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b431-4\">Plaintiffs\u2019 Proposed Claim Construction</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">Government\u2019s Proposed Claim Construction</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">Means Larson-Miller relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-7\">Means a mathematical relationship between the application of an energy to a structure and the change in a response of the structure that varies with the value of one and only one variable, and where the rate of change in the variable is exponential such that a plot of the natural logarithm overtime results in a straight line.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-8\">Term 5 appears in Claims 1, 7, 11, and 14. Plaintiffs note that Claims 1, 7, and 14 use the term \u201cfirst order rate relationship,\u201d and then quote claims that relate a first order rate relationship to a Larson-Miller relationship. <em>See </em>\u2019722 patent, Claim 1, col. 20, lines 9-14 (\u201c[W]herein the first order rate relationship for the first energy process is a first Larson[-]Miller relationship ... and wherein the first order rate relationship for the second energy process is a second Larson[-]Miller relationship.\u201d); <em>id. </em>at Claim 7, col. 21, lines 11-15; <em>id. </em>at Claim 14, col. 22, lines 57-62.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Plaintiffs argue that these claims in effect equate \u201cfirst order rate relationship\u201d to a \u201cLarson[-]Miller relationship.\u201d <em>See </em>Pis.\u2019 Br. at 25 (\u201cThis language serves to equate the claim term \u2018first order rate relationship\u2019 with the term \u2018Larson[-]Miller relationship\u2019 by expressly stating that the first order rate relationship <em>is </em>a Larson[-]Miller relationship.\u201d) (emphasis in original). Plaintiffs cite to <em>Griffin v. Bertina, </em>285 F.3d 1029, 1034 (Fed.Cir.2002), to support this proposition, arguing that the Federal Circuit in that instance held \u201cthat a \u2018wherein\u2019 clause of an independent claim was limiting because it signaled the patentee\u2019s intent to elaborate on the meaning of a previously recited claim term.\u201d Pis.\u2019 Br. at 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-9\">The circumstances of this patent are distinguishable from those of <em>Griffin, </em>however. In that case, the Federal Circuit held that the Patent Board had not erred when it determined that \u201cwherein\u201d clauses limited the scope of a claim \u201cbecause they relate[d] back to and elarif[ied] what is required.\u201d <em>Griffin, </em>285 F.3d at 1034. It did not hold that a \u201cwherein\u201d clause limited the meaning of another phrase used throughout the patent. Here, by contrast, the \u2019722 patent uses the term \u201cfirst order rate relationship\u201d in independent Claim 11, in which no \u201cwherein\u201d clause is used to establish that the first order rate relationship is a Larson-Miller relationship. Thus, while the scope of Claims 1, 7, and 14 may be limited by the language of the pertinent \u201cwherein\u201d clauses, the meaning of Term 5 as a general matter is not cabined by such.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-12\">The government argues that Term 5 should be given its ordinary meaning, as understood by people with ordinary skill in the art. Def.\u2019s Br. at 20; Hr\u2019g Tr. 33:4-12. The court agrees with the government that a first order rate relationship is a well-known concept of mathematics used in scientific fields, and accordingly adopts the government\u2019s proffered construction with minor changes. Term 5, \u201cfirst order rate relationship,\u201d means a mathematical relationship between the application of an energy to a structure and the responsive change in the structure that varies with the value of one variable, and where the rate of change in the variable is exponential such that a plot of the natural logarithm over time results in a straight line.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-13\">The latter aspect of this definition is valid in this particular instance even though it would not apply generally as a matter of mathematics. Here, the specification refers repeatedly to a first order rate relationship <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>that is a variant of the Arrhenius equation as applied in physics rather than chemistry, <em>e.g., </em>a Larson-Miller relationship. <em>See </em>\u2019722 patent, col. 2, lines 55-57 (where the words \u201csuch as\u201d are used to introduce the phrase \u201cArhennius[sic]-type first order rate equation\u201d); <em>see also id. </em>at col. 5, line 66 to col. 6, line 5 (\u201cThe first order rate relationships ... may be ... any characterization or expression of a relationship between application of the corresponding energy type to the structure and a physical property of interest, for example, including but not limited to Larson-Miller relationships and/or equivalents thereof.\u201d); <em>id. </em>col. 6, lines 21-23 (\u201cIn one implementation of the invention, L[arson]-M[iller] equations may be derived by taking the log of the Arrhenius equation.\u201d). Although the words \u201csuch as\u201d and \u201cincluding but not limited to\u201d would ordinarily denote examples and not limitations, in this instance plaintiffs also agree that the patent specification uniformly treats of a first order rate relationship that is a Larson-Miller relationship, <em>i.e., </em>one \u201cderived by taking the log of the Arrhenius equation.\u201d \u2019722 patent, col. 6, lines 21-23. The specification bears out the parties\u2019 agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"ALL\">\n<em>Tenn 6: \"Desired physical property value. \u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">Plaintiffs\u2019 Proposed Claim Construction</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">Government\u2019s Proposed Claim Construction</p>\n<p id=\"b432-7\">Means a result or change that is sought from subjecting the structure to processing.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-8\">Means a value representing the desired condition of a \u201cphysical property of interest\u201d or the amount of change in the \u201cphysical properly of interest\u201d to be achieved through use of the process._</p>\n<p id=\"b432-9\">Term 6 is found in Claims 1, 2, 6, 7, 8, 11, and 14. The salient aspect of the disagreement between Hitkansut and the government over the term\u2019s meaning is whether the term represents a \u201cdesire at the beginning that\u2019s selected to help [the patentee] choose at what level [the patentee] want[s] these energies to be applied to ... achieve [a goal],\u201d Hr\u2019g Tr. 44:3-5, or whether it is a numeric value \u201cthat represents the amount of change or condition of the structure after treatment,\u201d Def.\u2019s Br. at 24. Hitkansut asserts that the specification supports its proffered construction, because it describes the invention as a method for:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-10\">changing a physical property of a structure, wherein the physical property can be creep rate, creep, strain, stress, residual stress, internal stress, aging, mixing, motion through a membrane, or any property, such as those that may be controlled according to an Arhennius[sic]-type first order rate equation____ In one example, the physical property may be internal stress, where the desired physical property value is one of a remaining internal stress value and an internal stress reduction value.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b432-12\">\u2019722 patent, col. 2, lines 52-67. Subsequently in the specification, a recitation notes that the physical property value can be a value, such as a stress relief level. <em>Id. </em>at col. 8, lines 38-39 (\u201cany desired physical property value <em>(e.g., </em>stress relief level\u201d)). The plaintiffs thus argue that \u201cdesired physical property value\u201d \u201cencompasses a relative result that is sought by processing, such as a reduced amount of residual stress.\u201d Pis.\u2019 Br. at 28. When read in concert with the specification, the language of the claims also supports plaintiffs\u2019 proffered construction, because the claims indicate that the \u201cdesired physical property value\u201d is one of the variables used to select an operational setting or a time value. <em>See e.g., </em>\u2019722 patent, Claim 1, col. 19, lines 45-51 (\u201cproviding a first energy to a structure by performing a first energy process according to an operational setting, at least one of the operational setting and a time value being selected according to a first order rate relationship for the first energy process, according to a first order rate relationship for the a second energy process, <em>and according to a desired physical property value </em>\u201d) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b432-14\">For the reasons stated, the court adopts the plaintiffs\u2019 construction for Term 6, that \u201cdesired physical property value\u201d means a result or change in the physical condition of a structure that is sought from subjecting the structure to processing.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number><em>Term </em>7: <em>\"At least one of the operational setting and a time value being selected according to a first order rate relationship for the first energ)/ process, according to a first order rate relationship for a second energy process, and according to a desired physical property value. \u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">Plaintiffs\u2019 Proposed Claim Construction</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">Government\u2019s Proposed Claim Construction</p>\n<p id=\"b433-7\">Means choosing a characteristic of the energy process or the time value of the energy process with a first order rate relationship for the first energy process, a first order rate relationship for a second energy process, and a desired physical property value in mind to achieve a temporal acceleration in the desired physical property value._</p>\n<p id=\"b433-8\">Means choosing at least one of an operational setting or a time value by applying the first order rate relationship for the first energy process and the first order rate relationship for the second energy process to apply sufficient energy to achieve the desired physical property value.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-9\">Term 7 appears in Claims 1 and 7. The dispute between the parties with regard to Term 7 is essentially whether the phrase \u201cshould be construed to include the goal of \u2018achiev[ing] a temporal acceleration in the physical property value.\u2019 \u201d Def.\u2019s Br. at 24 (alteration in original). The phrase \u201ctemporal acceleration in the desired physical property value\u201d appears nowhere in the term; nor would it be inferred by a person with ordinary skill in the art. Therefore, the court declines to include the phrase in the construction of the term. The notion of a desired goal is encapsulated within the definition of Term 6, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b433-11\">For the reasons stated above, and drawing upon the terms defined <em>supra, </em>the court adopts the following construction for Term 7: choosing a set point or time value for a first order rate relationship for the first energy process and for a first order rate relationship for the second energy process, to achieve a desired physical property value.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-12\">\n<em>Term 8: \u201cPerformed concurrently for at least the/a time value.\"</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b433-13\">Plaintiffs\u2019 Proposed Claim Construction</p>\n<p id=\"b433-14\">Govcmmcnt\u2019s Proposed Claim Constniction</p>\n<p id=\"b433-15\">Means the presence of the energies in the structure during tire time value.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-16\">Ordinary meaning: the two energy processes must be performed simultaneously for a time period that is predetermined._</p>\n<p id=\"b433-17\">Term 8 appears in Claims 1 and 7. The representative language is illustrated by Claim 1, which states \u201cwherein the first and second energy processes are performed concurrently for at least the time value.\u201d \u2019722 patent, Claim 1, col. 19, lines 54-55. Plaintiffs argue that the term encompasses a phase when \u201cthe energies are within the part during the same period of time, whether the physical switch on the equipment is on or off.\u201d Hr\u2019g Tr. 54:8-11. They support this position in their claim construction brief by noting that the term should include a situation where \u201cthe work piece is heated up to the appropriate temperature and then the heat source is turned off and the second energy is started,\u201d Pis.\u2019 Br. at 30, and assert that the specification contemplates this circumstance, <em>id. </em>(quoting \u2019722 patent, col. 16, lines 51-57). Plaintiffs\u2019 interpretation of the relevant portion of the specification is misplaced. The pertinent portions of the specification state:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-19\">[T]he thermal and oscillatory processes need not be exactly aligned in time, but need only be applied concurrently for the minimum time value ... to achieve the desired amount of internal stress relief within the scope of the invention---- Other implementations of concurrent application of multiple energy types are contemplated within the scope of the invention. For example, either processes (e.g., heat or vibration) may be started before the other one, or both may begin at the same time. Furthermore, either process may be continued after the other is discontinued or both may end at the same time.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b433-21\">\u2019722 patent, col. 16, lines 32-37, lines 51-57. The statement that \u201ceither process may be continued after the other is discontinued\u201d indicates that, at least at some point, both processes must be performed at the same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>time. It excludes a scenario where one process ends and a lull occurs, after which the second process begins. In effect, the specification confirms the ordinary usage of the word \u201cconcurrent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">Accordingly, the court adopts the following construction for Term 8: \u201cperformed concurrently for at least the/a time value\u201d means the two energy processes must be simultaneously applied for at least a portion of the processing period.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\"><em>Term 9: \"The total energy provided to the structure by the first and second energy processes. </em>\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b434-7\">Plaintiffs\u2019 Proposed Claim Construction</p>\n<p id=\"b434-8\">Government\u2019s Proposed Claim Construction</p>\n<p id=\"b434-9\">Means the total quantity of work or heat applied by the first and second energies.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-10\">Means the sum of the energy added to the structure as the result of applying the first energy process plus the energy added to the structure as the result of applying the second energy process._</p>\n<p id=\"b434-11\">Term 9 appears in Claims 1 and 7. Both parties contend their proposed constructions reflect the common, ordinary meaning of the term. <em>See </em>Pis.\u2019 Br. at 32; Def.\u2019s Br. at 26. They agree that their proposed constructions are not very different in substance, and that the meaning of the term hinges on the court\u2019s construction of Term 2, \u201cenergy.\u201d <em>See </em>Pis.\u2019 Br. at 32; Def.\u2019s Br. at 26. The court has determined that Term 2 means \u201cthe capacity to do work by various means, here, specifically, the capacity or capability to act on a structure.\u201d <em>See supra </em>p. 417. The court need not substitute that definition for the word \u201cenergy\u201d in Term 9, as plaintiffs urge. <em>See </em>Pis.\u2019 Br. at 32.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-13\">Accordingly, the court adopts the following meaning for Term 9: \u201cthe total energy provided to the structure by the first and second energy processes\u201d means the sum of the energy supplied to the structure via the application of the first and second energy processes, taken together.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-14\">\n<em>Term 10: \u201cActivation energy for the materia!. \u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b434-15\">Plaintiffs\u2019 Proposed Claim Construction</p>\n<p id=\"b434-16\">Government\u2019s Proposed Claim Construction</p>\n<p id=\"b434-17\">Means the energy required for initiating a change in a property of the structure.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-18\">Common meaning: the energy, in excess over the ground state, which must be added to an atomic or molecular system to allow a particular process to take place._</p>\n<p id=\"b434-19\">Term 10 appears in claims 1, 7, and 11. The government asserts that its proffered construction gives the term \u201cits ordinary meaning to those skilled in physical chemistry, physics and materials engineering\u201d and should be used because the term is not defined in the specification or prosecution history. Def.\u2019s Br. at 26. Plaintiffs refute this, saying that the patentee \u201chas made special use of [the] term [in the specification] to describe the energy required to initiate a change in a property in the structure.\u201d Pis.\u2019 Br. at 33. The specification supports plaintiffs\u2019 proffered definition. In discussing the first energy process, the specification notes that \u201cprocessing equipment, such as thermal energy sources, may have upper limits on temperature, and/or it may be desired to maintain the structure at or below a safe temperature to avoid changing the structure temper or melting the structure, whereas a minimum temperature value would be a critical temperature for the material to exceed the activation energy therefor.\u201d \u2019722 patent, col. 12, lines 9-15. The specification also uses \u201cactivation energy\u201d in describing how internal or residual stress relief can be achieved by moving dislocations and reducing the overall dislocation density:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-21\">The formation of a dislocation will result when the strain reaches a certain value equivalent to the <em>activation energy. </em>No dislocation interaction will occur unless it is energetically favorable to do so____ [Ejnergy is added to the dislocations that results in exciting their motion. Since any system will move to the lower energy state, the dislocations will try to attain a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>lower energy configuration by combining or annihilating, thus reducing the internal stresses in the material.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b435-4\"><em>Id. </em>at col. 8, lines 47-58 (emphasis added). In short, the specification uses \u201cactivation energy\u201d in a particular manner, as plaintiffs correctly assert, with reference to the energy needed to initiate a change in a property of the structure.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">The court adopts plaintiffs\u2019 proffered construction of Term 10: \u201cActivation energy for the material\u201d means the energy required for initiating a change in a property of the structure.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-7\">\n<em>Term 11: \u201cOscillatory energy.\"</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b435-8\">Plaintiffs\u2019 Proposed Claim Construction</p>\n<p id=\"b435-9\">Government\u2019s Proposed Claim Construction</p>\n<p id=\"b435-10\">Means pressure wave.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-11\">Means energy having frequency, amplitude and time as variables, including sound, mechanical vibration, and laser impulses._</p>\n<p id=\"b435-12\">Term 11 appeal\u2019s in Claim 1. Plaintiffs contend that the patentee, acting as her own lexicographer, used the specification to define the term to mean \u201cpressure wave.\u201d Pis.\u2019 Br. at 35-36. The government also argues that the patentee gave the term a special meaning, but a different one, consisting of its proffered definition invoking characteristics of an oscillation along with examples. <em>See </em>Def.\u2019s Br. at 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-13\">Plaintiffs assert that the following passage from the specification supports their definition: \u201cWhen energy, whether in the form of heat or any time-varying (e.g., oscillatory, periodic, pulsed) applied energy that can cause a pressure wave to be generated, is applied to a crystalline solid, energy is added to the dislocations that results in exciting their motion.\u201d \u2019722 patent, col. 8, lines 50-55. While this sentence notes that oscillatory energy may produce a pressure wave, it does not equate the two terms. Accordingly, plaintiffs\u2019 proposed definition cannot be accepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-14\">In support of its construction, the government does identify a portion of the specification that illuminates the meaning of Term 11, but its proffered interpretation also is unduly limiting. The relevant sentence of the specification states: \u201cThe oscillatory process, whether using sound, mechanical vibration, laser impulses, or some other oscillatory or time-varying applied energy process, is usually performed at a fixed temperature, where time, frequency, and amplitude are the variables.\u201d \u2019722 patent, at col. 10, lines 41-46. The specification continues by noting that the frequency and amplitude settings can be determined by varied techniques, including \u201cby identifying a resonant frequency for the structure and the system in which the structure is to be mounted during processing, and selecting a frequency at or near the resonant frequency.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at col. 10, lines 51-54. It also states that \u201cspecific frequency ranges for alloys can be predetermined for a specific method of frequency generation, whether sonic, laser, electrical, magnetic, mechanical, and mici\u2019owave, or some other type.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at col. 11, lines 59-63. These references (sound, mechanical vibration, magnetic, microwave, and laser impulses) are to energy processes that can serve as methods of frequency generation, perhaps to achieve a resonant frequency, and perhaps not.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-17\">In short, there is no indication in the specification that the patentee deviated from use of the ordinary meaning of oscillatory\u2014 to move back and forth above and below a centering value. As such, the court adopts the following construction for Term 11: \u201coscillatory energy\u201d means energy that swings back and forth above and below a mean value.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-18\">\n<em>Term 12: \u201cThermal energy.\"</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"pA9LF\">Plaintiffs\u2019 Proposed Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b435-19\">Proposed Claim Construction</p>\n<p id=\"pAPo\">Means heat that is not normally present.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-20\">Means the amount of energy expressed as above absolute zero._</p>\n<p id=\"b436-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>Term 12 appears in Claim 1. Both parties agree that \u201cthermal\u201d refers to an energy expressed as temperature. <em>See </em>Pis.\u2019 Br. at 37; Def.\u2019s Br. at 29. Defendant argues that its definition based upon thermal energy measured on the Kelvin or Rankine scales above absolute zero is supported because the equations used in the \u2019722 patent use absolute temperature scales. Def.\u2019s Br. at 29-30 (citing \u2019722 patent, col. 7, lines 40-67). Plaintiffs, in turn, assert that the definition reflects the ordinary meaning of the term, because \u201c[t]hose skilled in the art of heat treatment processes, and particularly heat treatment processes for metals, would understand the term \u2018thermal energy1 to be energy in the form of heat that is added to a system.\u201d Pis.\u2019 Br. at 37. Plaintiffs also contend that the specification supports their proposed construction, and undercuts that of the defendant, because \u201cthe exemplary temperatures provided are all well above room temperature.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 38-39 (citing \u2019722 patent, col. 14, lines 50-65).</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">Plaintiffs\u2019 proffered construction is supported by the specification, which addresses thermal energy sources and then notes that \u201ca section of a ship hull, aircraft structure, or bridge may be difficult to bring to a very high temperature, due to ambient conditions and/or heat sinking from attached structures.\u201d \u2019722 patent, col. 12, lines 9-10, 15-18. This section illustrates that when the patent references thermal energy, it contemplates an addition of heat to the ambient state of a structure.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">Accordingly, the court adopts plaintiffs\u2019 construction of Term 12, with minor revisions: \u201cthermal energy\u201d means heat that is not present at the ambient condition of the structure.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-7\"><em>Term 13: \u201cParameter. </em>\u201d__</p>\n<p id=\"pAAJP\">Plaintiffs\u2019 Proposed Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b436-8\">Proposed Claim Construction</p>\n<p id=\"b436-9\">Means Larson-Miller parameter.</p>\n<p id=\"AkZ\">Plain meaning: a quantity which is constant under a given set of conditions, hut may be different under other conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-11\">Term 13 appears in dependent Claims 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9,10, and 13, and independent Claims 12 and 14.

Claim 14, in turn, provides for \u201cdetermining a first parameter according to a desired physical property value for the structure and according to a first order rate relationship for a first energy process, ... determining a second parameter according [to] the desired physical property value and according to a first order rate relationship for a second energy process[,] ... and selecting a second one of the time value and the operational setting according to the first and second parameters^] ... wherein the first order rate relationship for the first energy process is a first Larson[-]Miller relationship ... and wherein the first order rate relationship for the second energy process is a second Larson[-]Miller relationship.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at col. 22, lines 41-62.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-13\">\u201c[T]he context in which a term is used in the asserted claim can be highly instructive.\u201d <em>Phillips, </em>415 F.3d at 1314. In this instance, the context in which \u201cparameter\u201d is used is dispositive. The claim language quoted <em>supra </em>makes evident that the patentee is referring to a depiction of the Larson-Miller relationship each time the term \u201cparameter\u201d is used. For that reason, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>the court adopts a modified version of plaintiffs\u2019 proffered construction of Term 13: \u201cparameter\u201d means a point or points on the curve or equation that define the Larson-Miller relationship, or that are representative of empirical data from which such a curve or equation might be derived or approximated.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\"><em>Term 14: </em>\"Larson-Millerrelationship.\u201d_</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">Plaintiffs\u2019 Proposed Claim Construction</p>\n<p id=\"b437-7\">Government\u2019s Proposed Claim Construction</p>\n<p id=\"b437-8\">Means a relationship between the physical stale of the structure and the operational setting of the energy process.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-9\"><em>Means a first order rate relationship that is characterized by the following equation: P= </em>^=T(C+ <em>logt).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b437-10\">Term 14 appears in Claims 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14. The parties disagree over whether Term 14 requires reference to an equation. <em>Compare </em>Pis.\u2019 Br. at 41, <em>with </em>Def.\u2019s Br. at 31. Plaintiffs argue that \u201creference to an equation is one way to utilize the Larson[-]Miller relationship\u201d but that it can also \u201cbe utilized as a graphical expression or through experimentation.\u201d Pis.\u2019 Br. at 41 (internal citations omitted). The government argues that the patentee restricted the definition of Term 14 to \u201cthe first order rate equation commonly known as the \u2018Larson[-]Miller\u2019 equation\u201d during the prosecution of the patent. Def.\u2019s Br. at 32. It cites to a final office action issued on June 16,2006, in which the patent examiner rejected all but two claims (then labeled as claims 20 and 21) and also noted that other claims (then-pending claims 4-9, 11-14, 19, and 24) were allowable \u201cif rewritten in independent form including all of the limitations of the base claim and any intervening claims.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at App. 261 (Final Action (June 16, 2006)). The examiner stated that he allowed Claims 20 and 21 because \u201cExhibits D and E [of Ms. Walker\u2019s declaration filed on April 3, 2006] have shown that the combination of parameters determined by Larson-Miller and combined thermal and vibration process is critical and reduee[s] stress.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The patent applicant then rewrote Claims 4, 5,11,19, 20, and 24, and noted that there was \u201cno intention of surrendering any range of equivalents to which [applicant would otherwise be entitled in view of the prior art.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at App. 265-270, 272 (Response and Amendment (Sept. 15, 2006)). The applicant also stated that she \u201cintendfed] to file a continuation application to pursue the breadth of the claims as originally filed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at App. 272. The government contends that these statements show that the applicant \u201cexplicitly acquiesced in the examiner\u2019s reasoning ... [and] limited the scope of each of the claims to the use of the Larson[-]Miller parameter, <em>P=AH/R=T(C + log </em>i).\u201d Def.\u2019s Br. at 35. Thus, the government argues that any broader claim interpretation was disclaimed during prosecution, and consequently that the claims are now limited to the use of the Larson-Miller equation. Def.\u2019s Br. at 35-36 (citing <em>ACCO Brands, Inc. v. Micro Sec. Devices, Inc., </em>346 F.3d 1075, 1078 (Fed.Cir.2003) (\u201cStatements made during prosecution which clearly disclaim a particular claim interpretation will limit the scope of the claims.\u201d)).</p>\n<p id=\"b437-13\">The government\u2019s interpretation ignores that parameters determined by a Larson-Miller relationship are not limited to those derived explicitly from an equation. Parameters may be determined based upon plots of experimental data, <em>i.e., </em>in essence from experiments, the results of which define a part of the relationship empirically. That indeed was the approach taken by Larson and Miller in their seminal paper. <em>See supra </em>n.8. The patent specification confirms that this possibility is contemplated in, and encompassed by, the patent. <em>See </em>\u2019722 patent, col. 6, lines 16-17, 23-26, 30-41.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-14\">The doctrine of claim differentiation also counsels against a narrow interpretation of Term 14. Under that doctrine, there is a presumption that an independent claim should not be construed as requiring a limitation added by a dependent claim. <em>Curtiss-Wright Flow Control Corp., </em>438 F.3d at 1380. In the \u2019722 patent, Claim 13,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> a depen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>dent claim, modifies the scope of independent claim 12 and its use of \u201cLarson-Miller relationship\u201d by reciting \u201cwherein the first Larson[-]Miller equation represents the first Larson[-]Miller relationship.\u201d \u2019722 patent, col. 22, lines 35-36. Therefore, a presumption arises that Larson-Miller equation and Larson-Miller relationship have different meanings, such that Larson-Miller relationship is not limited to describing the mathematical expression <em>P=AH/R=T(C </em>+ <em>logt).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">Accordingly, the court adopts the following construction for Term 14: \u201cLarson-Miller relationship\u201d means a parametric representation of a system of physical properties of a structure subjected to energy processes, which can take the form of the equation <em>P\u2014hJpR=T{C + log t).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\"><em>Term 15: \u201cThe Larson-Miller relationship that relates concurrent application of the first and second energy to the structure and the physical property of the structure, </em>\"_</p>\n<p id=\"b438-8\">Plaintiffs\u2019 Proposed Claim Construction__Government\u2019s Proposed Claim Construction</p>\n<p id=\"b438-9\">Plain meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"Azc\">Means a combined first order rate relationship that is defined by the Larson-Miller relationship that corresponds to the concurrent application of the first and second energies to the structure.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-11\">Term 15 appears in Claim 11. The parties accept that the dispute over the meaning of Term 15 will be resolved by the court\u2019s constructions of Term 1, \u201cstructure,\u201d Term 2, \u201cenergy,\u201d Term 3, \u201cenergy processes,\u201d Term 8, \u201cperformed concurrently,\u201d and Term 14, \u201cLarson-Miller relationship.\u201d <em>See </em>Pis.\u2019 Br. at 44; Def.\u2019s Br. at 36.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-12\">Accordingly, the court determines that Term 15, \u201cthe Larson-Miller relationship that relates concurrent application of the first and second energy to the structure and the physical property of the structure,\u201d means the Larson-Miller relationship that correlates the change in physical property of the structure to the concurrent application of the first and second energies to the structure.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-14\"><em>Term 16: \u201cRemaining, internal stress value. </em>\"</p>\n<p id=\"b438-15\">Plaintiffs\u2019 Proposed Claim Construction</p>\n<p id=\"b438-16\">Government\u2019s Proposed Claim Construction</p>\n<p id=\"b438-17\">Means amount of internal stress that is still present after processing.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-18\">Means a value representing the amount of internal stress that remains in the structure after the concurrent application of two or more energy processes._</p>\n<p id=\"b438-19\">Term 16 appears in Claim 6. The crux of the parties\u2019 dispute is whether Term 16 represents a discrete numeric value or a relative amount of remaining internal stress. <em>Compare </em>Pis.\u2019 Br. at 45, <em>with </em>Def.\u2019s Br. at 37. Plaintiffs submit that those with ordinary skill in the art of heat treatment processing would recognize that heat treatment processing is often performed to bring the remaining internal stress value in a structure as close to zero as possible, without an emphasis on the particular numeric value that is reached. <em>See </em>Pis.\u2019 Br. at 46. They also point to the language of the specification, which states that \u201cthe invention has been successfully implemented in reducing remaining internal (e.g., residual) stress in aluminum structures using concurrent application of thermal and oscillatory energy (e.g., mechanical vibration) to achieve a significant reduction in the time required to obtain a desired remaining internal stress value (e.g., or a desired amount of internal stress reduction).\u201d \u2019722 patent, col. 13, lines 50-57. This language indicates that a goal of the invention described in the \u2019722 patent is to reduce the internal stress of a structure as much as practicably possible in an accelerated time period. The illustrations contained within the \u2019722 patent also comport with plaintiffs\u2019 stance, because they show, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>through the use of points plotted on graphs, that the process desires to bring the remaining internal stress in a structure as close to a given numeric value as possible, but not necessarily to that exact value. <em>See \u2019722 </em>patent, Sheets 5-6, Figs. 4A, 4B, 4D, and their accompanying descriptions, found at col. 4, lines 53-67. The court recognizes that a person with ordinary skill in the art would appreciate that it is difficult to quantify the internal stress that remains in a structure after processing, and that the specification contemplates this circumstance. Accordingly, it deems the government\u2019s proposed construction to be too limited.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">For the above reasons, the court adopts plaintiffs\u2019 proffered construction of Term 16, with minor changes: \u201cremaining internal stress value\u201d means the residual internal stress in a structure after processing has occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-7\">\n<em>Term 17: \u201cInternal stress reduction value.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b439-8\">Plaintiffs\u2019 Proposed Claim Construction</p>\n<p id=\"b439-9\">Government\u2019s Proposed Claim Construction</p>\n<p id=\"b439-10\">Means amount of the reduction of the internal stress by the process.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-11\">Means a value representing the reduction in the amount of internal stress in the structure as a result of concurrently applying two or more energy processes to the structure._</p>\n<p id=\"b439-12\">Term 17 appears in Claim 6. The parties\u2019 disagreement mirrors their conflict with respect to Term 16, <em>supra. </em>Again, the government submits that term must be associated with a specific numeric value, <em>see </em>Hr\u2019g Tr. 77:21 to 78:2, while the plaintiffs counsel against a definition that incorporates numerical precision, and advocate for one that can represent a broader goal, Hr\u2019g Tr. 80:5-17. For the reasons stated in the discussion following Term 16, <em>supra, </em>the court again endorses a construction broader than the one suggested by the government.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-14\">The court adopts the following meaning of Term 17: \u201cinternal stress reduction value\u201d means the degree of diminution in internal stress of a structure resulting from processing.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-15\"><em>Term 18: \"Multiple energy </em>forms.\"__</p>\n<p id=\"b439-16\">Plaintiffs\u2019 Proposed Claim Construction__Government\u2019s Proposed Claim Construction</p>\n<p id=\"b439-17\">Means at least a first energy and a second energy where the first and second energies are</p>\n<p id=\"pAmS\">Two or more fonns of energy,</p>\n<p id=\"b439-19\">Term 18 appears in Claim 14. The government\u2019s proffered construction contemplates the ordinary meaning of the term. <em>See </em>Hr\u2019g Tr. 82:14-16. Plaintiffs argue that the term also contemplates that two of the energies described must be of different types. <em>See </em>Pis.\u2019 Br. at 48-49; Hr\u2019g Tr. 8:13\u2014 20. They base their argument in part on the prosecution history, specifically on an Amendment dated April 4, 2006 which changed the term \u201cmultiple energy types\u201d to \u201cmultiple energy forms,\u201d <em>see </em>Pis.\u2019 Br., Ex. F at 7, because the patent examiner objected to the use of the word \u201ctype\u201d as being indefinite under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 112, <em>id. </em>at 12. Plaintiffs assert that the salient aspect of the Amendment is a sentence stating that Claim 14 (then Claim 22) is \u201cdirected to determining operational settings and time values for concurrent application of <em>multiple energy types </em>to a structure, in which first and second parameters are determined according to first order rate relationships for <em>two different energy processes.\u201d Id. </em>at 16 (emphasis added). They argue that this language means that \u201cmultiple energy forms\u201d encompasses the \u201ctwo different energy processes\u201d mentioned, which are the first energy process and the second energy process. Pis.\u2019 Br. at 49. Even setting aside the Federal Circuit\u2019s directive that the principal purpose of prosecution history is to exclude interpretations disclaimed during prosecution, <em>Chimie, </em>402 F.3d at 1384, plaintiffs\u2019 strained reasoning does not reach so far. While the court appreciates that \u201cmultiple energy types\u201d has a meaning very closely akin to \u201cmultiple energy forms,\u201d nothing in the rest of the cited <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>prosecution history suggests that multiple energy forms must include first and second energies which are different in the sense used in Claim 1, <em>e.g., </em>that one is thermal and the other is oscillatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-4\">For the reasons stated, the court adopts the government\u2019s proffered construction of Term 18: that \u201cmultiple energy forms\u201d means two or more forms of energy.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">\n<em>Term 19: \u201cLarson-Miller parameter.\"</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">Plaintiffs\u2019 Proposed Claim Construction</p>\n<p id=\"b440-7\">Government\u2019s Proposed Claim Construction</p>\n<p id=\"b440-8\">Means a value determined from a Larson-Miller curve, a Larson-Miller equation, or other expressions or characterizations of the Larson-Miller relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-9\">Means the value P determined by the following equation:</p>\n<p id=\"b440-10\">\n<em>AH</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b440-11\"><em>P = \u2014 = T(C+ </em>log t).</p>\n<p id=\"b440-12\">Term 19 appears in Claims 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 10, 12, and 13. Plaintiffs filed a supplemental brief on April 29, 2013, in which they advised that they were departing from the construction on which the parties had agreed in the Joint Claim Construction Statement. <em>See </em>Pis.\u2019 Supplemental Claim Construction Br. to Address a Further Disputed Claim Term at 1, ECF No. 32. The government continues to propose the formerly agreed construction. Questions have arisen regarding the timeliness of plaintiffs\u2019 submission. <em>See </em>Hr\u2019g Tr. 73:1-12. The court finds it unnecessary to address those concerns, because Term 13, \u201cparameter,\u201d and Term 19 in effect have corresponding meanings. <em>See supra </em>pp. 423-25.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-13\">Accordingly, the court determines that Term 19, \u201cLarson-Miller parameter,\u201d means a point or points on the curve or equation that define the Larson-Miller relationship, or empirical data from which such a curve or equation might be derived or approximated.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-14\">C. <em>Terms of the Claims as to Which Construction Is Agreed</em></p>\n<p id=\"b440-15\"><em>Term 20: \u201cSelecting. </em>\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b440-16\">Term 20 appears in Claims 2, 5, 8, 10, 12, 13, and 14.
