Mata (plaintiff or Mr. Mata), a former engineer with the United States Army (Army), brings this action against the United States (the government or defendant) alleging that the Army breached the parties\u2019 June 20, 2007 Negotiated Settlement Agreement (NSA). <em>See </em>Initial Complaint (Complaint or Compl.), Dkt. No. 7, \u00b6 l.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Plaintiff contends that \u201cthe Army breached several terms and conditions of the NSA ... causing the Plaintiff substantial monetary damages including but not limited to the Plaintiff losing his job of nineteen (19) years as a Professional Engineer in Federal civilian service.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b751-14\">Before the court are Plaintiff\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment, Dkt.

Background<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b752-6\">A. The Negotiated Settlement Agreement</p>\n<p id=\"b752-7\">In October 2006, plaintiff filed a whistle-blower grievance against his first-line and second-line supervisors, Nicolass DeGreef (Mr. DeGreef) and Michael Swenty (Mr. Swenty), respectively. PL\u2019s Mot. \u00b6 1. Plaintiff subsequently filed three additional administrative grievances alleging that, a result of his whistleblower activity, he was subject to harassment, discrimination, and reprisal by his supervisors at U.S. Army South (USARSO). <em>See id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 3-4, 6. In April 2007, plaintiff filed an informal Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) complaint with the Army\u2019s Equal Employment Office alleging the same issues pursuant to Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e. <em>See id. </em>\u00b6 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-8\">On June 20, 2007, plaintiff and USARSO\u2019s Command General entered into the NSA to resolve plaintiffs EEO complaint. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 7. The NSA was signed by plaintiff; Colonel Abel Concha (Col. Concha), plaintiffs third-line supervisor and the Deputy Chief of Staff of Engineers; and Bill Reimer, counsel for the Army. <em>Id.; see </em>Compl. \u00b6 37 (identifying Col. Concha\u2019s title).</p>\n<p id=\"b752-10\">The dispute before the court centers primarily on the obligations of the Army under paragraph three of the NSA, which states, in relevant part:</p>\n<p id=\"b752-11\">3. The Agency agrees:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-12\">a. To conduct an objective independent review of [Cjomplainant\u2019s 2006 performance evaluation and 11 Aug 06 letter of reprimand within 30 calendar days of the effective date [of] this agreement____ <em>During the pendency of the review, the [CJomplainant\u2019s 2006 evaluation and reprimand will be withdrawn from his personnel folder and the personnel data base. </em>If the review results in the upgrading of the performance appraisal, Complainant shall receive any and all awards issued to his counterparts with a similar rating.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-15\">b. As soon as possible during the 120 calendar day period from the effective date of this agreement with the right of Complainant to request an extension of time from the Chief of Staff, based on good cause due to no openings available during the 120 calendar day period, USARSO shall <em>make a good faith attempt to laterally transfer/reassign [CJomplainant to an equivalent position for which he is qualified, </em>in a directorate outside of [Deputy Chief of Staff, Engineer (DCSENG) ] but within USARSO. USARSO HR shall forward to Complainant and [the Civilian Personnel Advisory Center (CPAC) ] notice of any valid vacancy for which the Complainant could be deemed to be qualified by CPAC. CPAC will determine if Complainant is qualified for the vacancy and will notify the Chief of Staff of any positions for which he qualifies. The Chief of Staff will make the final <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>determination as to the acceptability of the recommendation....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b753-5\">e. <em>All actions, complaints, and disciplinary issues concerning Complainant prior to the date of signing of this instrument will be null and void.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b753-6\">Compl. at 26-29 (NSA) \u00b6 3 (emphasis added). Paragraph 4a of the NSA provides that \u201cthe Chief of Staff, USARSOU shall make the final determination regarding the findings of the independent review discussed in paragraph 3a,\u201d NSA \u00b6 4a, and, further to paragraph 3b of the NSA, paragraph 4d provides \u201cthat if for budgetary reasons, priority placement obligations, transformation issues, or any other valid cause, the Command has the discretion to not place the Complainant in a position recommended by CPAC,\u201d NSA \u00b6 4d.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-7\">Pursuant to paragraph 3a of the NSA, Colonel Robert Casias (Col. Casias) completed an independent review of plaintiffs 2006 performance evaluation and August 11, 2006 letter of reprimand. Pl.\u2019s Mot. \u00b6 12. A November 1, 2007 memorandum from Col. Casias to Colonel John Phelan (Col. Phelan), the USARSO Chief of Staff and plaintiffs fourth-line supervisor, details Col. Casias\u2019 findings and recommendations. Compl. at 30-34 (Casias Mem.). Col. Casias found that neither the 2006 performance evaluation, which rated plaintiff at a Level 4 (needs improvement), nor the August 11, 2006 letter of reprimand, were substantiated. <em>See id. </em>at 31,33. Based on these findings, Col. Casias recommended, in relevant part, that plaintiffs 2006 performance evaluation be upgraded from a Level 4 to a Level 2 (excellence), that plaintiffs August 11, 2006 letter of reprimand be removed from his personnel file, and that, further to paragraph 3b of the NSA, plaintiff be \u201claterally transferred or reassigned as quickly as possible.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 33-34.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-9\">Pursuant to paragraph 3b of the NSA, Sonia Caeeres (Ms. Caceres), USARSO HR, sent plaintiff and Lou Ann Reiser (Ms. Reiser), CPAC, an e-mail on October 3, 2007 attaching two lists of all the vacancies \u201cfor which [Mr. Mata] could be deemed qualified\u201d as of October 1, 2007.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Def.\u2019s App. A9 (Oct. 3, 2007 e-mail); <em>see id. </em>at A10-A13 (vacancy lists). Ms. Reiser reviewed the lists of vacancies and determined that there were no equivalent engineer positions for which Mr. Mata was qualified. <em>See </em>Def.\u2019s App. A5-A6 (Reiser Dep. 39:18-40:17, 41:6-14).</p>\n<p id=\"b753-10\">On November 9, 2007, Col. Phelan released to plaintiff a memorandum detailing, pursuant to paragraphs 3b and 4a of the NSA, his determinations. Compl. at 35 (Phelan Mem.). After considering Col. Casias\u2019 review, Col. Phelan intended to upgrade plaintiffs 2006 performance evaluation to a Level 37 and to let stand plaintiffs August 11, 2006 letter of reprimand. <em>Id. </em>Col. Phelan indicated that he had \u201cmet with Ms. Lou Ann Reiser of [CPAC] concerning the search for a valid vacancy for an equivalent engineer position to which [plaintiff] could be laterally transferred ... as required by [paragraph 3<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> of the] NSA.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Because \u201c[n]o unencumbered vacant equivalent engineer position was found,\u201d Col. Phelan determined that plaintiff would remain in his current position. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b753-11\">B. Plaintiffs Removal from the Army</p>\n<p id=\"b753-12\">On September 26, 2007, nearly three months after the NSA at issue in this case had been executed, the Army issued plaintiff a notice of proposed suspension for the offenses of insubordination, delay in carrying out instructions, discourtesy to a supervisor, unexeused tardiness and other attendance issues, and knowingly making false statements\u2014all stemming from events that tran<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>spired between August 2007 and September 2007. Pl.\u2019s Suppl. Br., Ex. 8 at 1-2 (Sept. 26, 2007 Notice of Proposed Suspension). Subsequently, plaintiff was suspended from work for fourteen days. <em>Id., </em>Ex. 9 at 1 (Nov. 1, 2007 Notice of Suspension). On December 13, 2007, the Army issued plaintiff a second notice of proposed suspension for the offense of misconduct stemming from events that transpired in November 2007. <em>Id., </em>Ex. 12 at 1-2 (Dee. 13, 2007 Notice of Proposed Suspension). Plaintiff was suspended again from work for fourteen days. <em>Id., </em>Ex. 13 at 1 (Feb. 4,2008 Notice of Suspension).</p>\n<p id=\"b754-5\">On February 19, 2008, Mr. Swenty sent plaintiff a notice of proposed removal from the Army. Compl. at 111-13 (Notice of Proposed Removal). Some of the reasons cited for Mr. Swenty\u2019s proposed removal action were plaintiffs two offenses of failing to follow instructions and plaintiffs one offense of exhibiting disrespect, each of which stemmed from events that transpired on January 25, 2008. <em>Id. </em>at 111. Mr. Swenty also considered the two fourteen-day suspensions plaintiff served and the Official Written Reprimand issued to plaintiff on August 11, 2006 \u201cfor the offense of inappropriate behavior.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 112. On March 24, 2008, Col. Concha sent plaintiff a notice of removal from federal service effective March 31, 2008, based on a review of all the available information. Compl. at 114 (Notice of Removal).</p>\n<p id=\"b754-7\">C. Relevant Procedural History<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b754-8\">On August 30, 2007 and again on November 30, 2007, plaintiff notified the Equal Employment Opportunity Compliance and Complaints Review Directorate (EEOCCR) of the Army\u2019s alleged noncompliance with the NSA. <em>See </em>Pl.\u2019s Suppl. Br., Ex. 7 (Aug. 30, 2007 EEOCCR notification); Compl. at 36-37 (Nov. 30, 2007 EEOCCR notification); cf. NSA \u00b6 5 (providing that if plaintiff believed that the Army had violated the terms of the NSA, he should notify the EEOCCR for enforcement or reinstatement). The EEOCCR found plaintiffs claims to be without merit and denied his request to reinstate his EEO complaint. Compl. at 48-43 (Dee. 13, 2007 EEOCCR decision). Plaintiff appealed the decision of the EEOCCR to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC). <em>See </em>Compl. at 44-47 (EEOC appeal). The decision of the EEOCCR was affirmed. Compl. at 48-53 (EEOC decision). Plaintiff subsequently filed a motion for reconsideration, Compl. at 54-61 (EEOC Mot. for Reconsideration), which the EEOC denied on May 20, 2008, Compl. at 62-64 (EEOC reconsideration decision).</p>\n<p id=\"b754-11\">On August 25, 2008, plaintiff filed suit in the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas (district court), claiming, inter alia, that the Army breached the NSA. <em>See Mata v. Green, </em>No. SA-08CA-709-OG (W.D.Tex. Aug. 25, 2008), Dkt. No. 1; <em>see also </em>PL\u2019s Mot. \u00b6 38; Def.\u2019s Mot. 11. The district court dismissed the action, finding that it lacked jurisdiction to hear plaintiffs claims and transferring the action to this court. <em>See </em>Order, <em>Mata v. Green, </em>No. SA-08-CA-079-OG (W.D.Tex. Aug. 20, 2009), Dkt. No. 26; <em>see also </em>Def.\u2019s Mot. 11. On March 5, 2010, plaintiff filed his transfer Complaint in this court. <em>See </em>Compl. 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-12\">On October 27, 2010, defendant filed a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, arguing that the NSA could not fairly be interpreted as money mandating, as required for this court to possess jurisdiction under the Tucker Act. Def.\u2019s Mot. to Dismiss, Dkt. No. 21, at 5; <em>cf. infra </em>Part II.A (discussing the Tucker Act). The court stayed the proceedings pending a decision by the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (Federal Circuit) in an unrelated, but potentially instructive ease, <em>Holmes v. United States, </em>92 Fed.Cl. 311 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>(2010), <em>appeal docketed, </em>No. 2010-5119 (Fed. Cir. May 14, 2010). Order of Jan. 11, 2011, Dkt. No. 28. On December 3, 2012, following the Federal Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>Holmes v. United States, </em>657 F.3d 1303 (Fed.Cir.2011), this court denied defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss. <em>See Mata v. United States, </em>107 Fed. Cl. 618, 623-24 (2012). This court found that because \u201cthe NSA in this case contemplates the possibility of plaintiffs future employment,] ... the NSA [could] be fairly interpreted as contemplating money damages through a relationship to Mr. Mata\u2019s future employment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 622-23 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted); cf. <em>Holmes, </em>657 F.3d at 1315-16 (finding that the settlement agreements at issue \u201cinherently relate[d] to monetary compensation through relationship to [the plaintifPs] future employment,\u201d and that, therefore, the Court of Federal Claims possessed jurisdiction over the plaintiffs breach of contract claims).</p>\n<p id=\"b755-5\">On July 27, 2013, plaintiff moved for summary judgment. <em>See </em>Pl.\u2019s Mot. 1. Plaintiff argues that the \u201cundisputed facts\u201d demonstrate that the Army breached its obligations under paragraphs 3a, 3b, and 3e of the NSA<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 33; <em>see </em>Pl.\u2019s Resp. 26 (arguing that the \u201cundisputed facts establish that the Army intentionally breached the NSA to the detriment of the Plaintiff\u2019). Specifically, plaintiff alleges that the Army breached the NSA by not upgrading plaintiffs 2006 performance evaluation to a Level 2, Compl. \u00b6 41; <em>see </em>Pl.\u2019s Mot. \u00b6 15, by failing to consider plaintiff for any valid vacancy for which he could be deemed qualified, <em>see </em>Pl.\u2019s Mot. \u00b6\u00b6 35-36, and by considering the August 6, 2011 letter of reprimand as support for plaintiffs removal from the Army, Pl.\u2019s Resp. 27; <em>see </em>Pl.\u2019s Mot. \u00b6 35.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-8\">On September 23, 2013, defendant filed its response and cross-motion for summary judgment. <em>See </em>Def.\u2019s Mot. 1. Defendant argues that plaintiff cannot establish either that the Army breached the NSA, <em>id. </em>at 19-26, or that he can recover any damages resulting from the alleged breach, <em>id. </em>at 26-28. Defendant adds that the court lacks jurisdiction to hear any claim by plaintiff that relitigates his removal from the Army, <em>id. </em>at 15-16, or that attributes fraudulent conduct to the Army, <em>id. </em>at 28-29.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-9\">II. Legal Standards</p>\n<p id=\"b755-10\">A Subject Matter Jurisdiction</p>\n<p id=\"b755-11\">The Tucker Act establishes and limits the jurisdiction of the Court of Federal Claims. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1491 (2006). The Tucker Act affords this court jurisdiction over \u201cany claim against the United States founded either upon the Constitution, or any Act of Congress or any regulation of an executive department, or upon any express or implied contract with the United States, or for liquidated or unliquidated damages in eases not sounding in tort.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1491(a)(1). Although the Tucker Act waives the sovereign immunity necessary for a plaintiff to sue the United States for money damages, <em>United States v. Mitchell, </em>463 U.S. 206, 212, 103 S.Ct. 2961, 77 L.Ed.2d 580 (1983), it does not confer any substantive rights upon a plaintiff, <em>United States v. Testan, </em>424 U.S. 392, 398, 96 S.Ct. 948, 47 L.Ed.2d 114 (1976). A plaintiff must establish an independent substantive right to money damages from the United States\u2014that is, a money-mandating source within a contract, regulation, statute or constitutional provision\u2014in order for the case to proceed. <em>See Jan\u2019s Helicopter Serv., Inc. v. Fed. Aviation Admin., </em>525 F.3d 1299, 1306 (Fed.Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b756-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>In this ease, the court already has found that because \u201cthe NSA [could] fairly be interpreted as contemplating money damages through [a] relationship to Mr. Mata\u2019s future employment,\u201d the court \u201chas jurisdiction to consider Mr. Mata\u2019s breach of contract claim for monetary damages under the Tucker Act.\u201d <em>Mata, </em>107 Fed.Cl. at 623-24.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-4\">B. Cross-Motions for Summary Judgment</p>\n<p id=\"b756-5\">The parties have filed cross-motions for summary judgment pursuant to Rule 56 of the Rules of the United States Court of Federal Claims (RCFC).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> A motion for summary judgment may be granted only when \u201cthere is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d RCFC 56(a). The moving party has the initial burden of establishing \u201cthe absence of any genuine issue of material fact and entitlement to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Crater Corp. v. Lucent Techs., Inc., </em>255 F.3d 1361, 1366 (Fed.Cir.2001). \u201cThe party opposing the motion must point to an evidentiary conflict created on the record; mere denials or conclusory statements are insufficient.\u201d <em>SRI Int\u2019l v. Matsushita Electric Corp. of Am., </em>775 F.2d 1107, 1116 (Fed.Cir.1985) (en banc); <em>see Grand Acadian, Inc. v. United States, </em>87 Fed.Cl. 193, 197 (2009) (\u201cWhen a motion for summary judgment is properly made and supported, an opposing party may not rely merely on allegations or denials in its own pleading; rather, its response must\u2014by affidavits or as otherwise provided in this rule\u2014 set out specific facts showing a genuine issue for trial.\u201d). The party opposing the motion must \u201ccome forward with relevant, admissible, and specific evidence demonstrating a genuine issue of material fact.\u201d <em>Coffee Connections, Inc. v. United States, </em>113 Fed.Cl. 741, 753 (2013) (citing RCFC 56(e)).</p>\n<p id=\"b756-6\">\u201c[T]he mere existence of some alleged factual dispute between the parties will not defeat an otherwise properly supported mo-</p>\n<p id=\"b756-8\">tion for summary judgment; the requirement is that there be no genuine issue of material fact.\u201d <em>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., </em>477 U.S. 242, 247-48, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986) (emphasis omitted). A fact is material if it might affect the outcome of the suit, and a dispute over a material fact is genuine \u201cif the evidence is such that a reasonable [factfinder] could return a verdict for the nonmoving party.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 248, 106 S.Ct. 2505. An issue is genuine if it might \u201creasonably be resolved in favor of either party.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 250,106 S.Ct. 2505.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-9\">In considering a motion for summary judgment, the court draws all inferences in favor of the nonmoving party. <em>See Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., </em>475 U.S. 574, 587, 106 S.Ct. 1348, 89 L.Ed.2d 538 (1986); <em>Mann v. United States, </em>334 F.3d 1048,1050 (Fed.Cir.2003). When considering cross-motions for summary judgment, \u201cthe court must evaluate each party\u2019s motion on its own merits, taking care in each instance to draw all reasonable inferences against the party whose motion is under consideration.\u201d <em>Mingus Constructors, Inc. v. United States, </em>812 F.2d 1387,1391 (Fed.Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b756-10\">III. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b756-11\">A. Whether the Army Breached the Negotiated Settlement Agreement</p>\n<p id=\"b756-12\">\u201cTo recover for breach of contract, a party must allege and establish: (1) a valid contract between the parties, (2) an obligation or duty arising out of the contract, (3) a breach of that duty, and (4) damages caused by the breach.\u201d <em>San Carlos Irrigation &amp; Drainage Dist. v. United States (San Carlos), </em>877 F.2d 957, 959 (Fed.Cir.1989). The parties do not dispute that the NSA is a valid contract. <em>See </em>Pl.\u2019s Mot. 29-31 (arguing that a contract exists); Def.\u2019s Mot. 21 (conceding that the NSA is a valid contract). The court agrees with defendant that the parties\u2019 dispute centers on their competing interpretations of the Army\u2019s obligations or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>duties arising out of the NSA. <em>See </em>Def.\u2019s Mot. 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-5\">Determining the obligations or duties that arise out of a contract \u201cis a legal question of contract interpretation,\u201d <em>San Carlos, </em>877 F.2d at 959, and contract interpretation is \u201cgenerally amenable to summary judgment,\u201d <em>Varilease Tech. Grp., Inc. v. United States, </em>289 F.3d 795, 798 (Fed.Cir. 2002). \u201cIt has been a fundamental precept of common law that the intention of the parties to a contract controls] its interpretation.\u201d <em>Beta Sys., Inc. v. United States (Beta), </em>838 F.2d 1179, 1185 (Fed.Cir.1988) (alteration and interna] quotation marks omitted). \u201c \u2018That intention must, in the first instance, be derived from the language of the contract.\u2019 \u201d <em>Nicholson v.

Moreover, paragraph 4a of the NSA affords the USARSO Chief of Staff with the authority to make the final determination with regard to the 2006 performance evaluation. <em>See </em>NSA \u00b6 4a.

Neither party addresses, however, whether Ms. Caceres complied with the terms of the NSA by providing plaintiff and Ms. Reiser with, as the court understands it, a snapshot of the vacancies available on October 1, 2007, or whether the NSA required Ms. Caceres to have notified plaintiff and Ms. Reiser of vacancies continuously as they opened from June 20, 2007 through October 20, 2007. <em>Cf. </em>Reiser Dep. 51:16-21 (Q: \u201cSo really it\u2019s just like one month of vacancies, isn\u2019t it, from October to November?\u201d A: \u201cThose vacancies could have been on there month after month, I don\u2019t know.

Plaintiff does not contend, and the record does not reflect, that the Army failed to remove the August 6, 2011 letter of reprimand from plaintiffs personnel folder and database during the pendency of Col. Casias\u2019 review. The court therefore finds that the Army did not breach paragraph 3c of the NSA, and the court GRANTS defendant\u2019s motion and DENIES plaintiffs motion as to this portion of plaintiffs claim. <em>See </em>RCFC 56(a).<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b763-7\">B. Whether Plaintiff Can Recover Damages Cannot Be Decided Now by Summary Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b763-8\">Defendant argues, in the alternative, that \u201c[e]ven if Mr. Mata could establish that the Army breached the NSA, ... Mr. Mata still cannot demonstrate all of the elements necessary for him to recover damages.\u201d Def.\u2019s Mot. 26. \u201cDamages for a breach of contract are recoverable where: (1) the damages were reasonably foreseeable by the breaching party at the time of contracting; (2) the breach is a substantial causal factor in the damages; and (3) the damages are shown with reasonable certainty.\u201d <em>Ind. Mich. Power Co. v. United States, </em>422 F.3d 1369, 1373 (Fed.Cir.2005). Defendant contends that plaintiff cannot establish that the damages he seeks either were caused by the Army\u2019s alleged breach of the NSA or were reasonably <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>foreseeable to the Army. Def.\u2019s Mot. 26. Plaintiff does not address defendant\u2019s arguments. <em>Cf. </em>Def.\u2019s Resp. 5 (\u201cMr. Mata has not presented any facts related to his burden....\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b764-4\">In the Complaint, plaintiff requests monetary damages for lost wages; \u201cany and all equitable ... relief, including reinstatement and promotion;\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> back pay, front pay and other compensatory damages; and attorney\u2019s fees.

United States, </em>2013 WL 363389 (Fed.Cl. Jan. 29, 2013), <em>aff'd, </em>\u2014 Fed.Appx. -, 2014 WL 114201 (Fed.Cir. Jan. 14, 2014); <em>cf. Ind. Mich.

Similar to the facts in this case, the plaintiff in <em>Zulueta </em>alleged that the government breached a settlement agreement into which the parties had entered to resolve an EEO complaint filed by the plaintiff. <em>Id. </em>at *1. Relying in part on <em>Holmes, </em>657 F.3d at 1312-15, the court first found that the settlement agreement was money-mandating and thus the court possessed jurisdiction to hear plaintiffs claims for reinstatement, money damages, and back pay. <em>See Zulueta, </em>2013 WL 363389 at *5-*7; <em>cf. supra </em>Part I.C (discussing <em>Holmes). </em>The court also found that plaintiff failed to show that the damages she sought arose from the government\u2019s alleged breach of the settlement agreement. <em>Zulueta, </em>2013 WL 363389 at *7. The court found, instead, that the damages were \u201crelate[d] not to the breach of the Settlement Agreement, but rather to the subsequent actionf] of the [government] in relieving [plaintiff] of her position.\u201d <em>Id.; see id. </em>at *2 (noting that, approximately two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>months after entering the settlement agreement, the plaintiff was removed from federal service due to her \u201cinability to perform the requirements of her position\u201d). The court therefore granted defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. <em>Id. </em>at *8.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">Noting a similarity to the <em>Zulueta </em>ease, defendant contends that \u201call of the alleged damages in Mr. Mata\u2019s complaint and motion relate not to the alleged breach of the settlement agreement, but to his subsequent removal.\u201d Def.\u2019s Mot. 28; <em>see id. </em>at 27 (\u201cAll of Mr. Mata\u2019s \u2018damages\u2019 are a proximate cause of his removal from federal service, which occurred as a result of his misconduct committed after the execution of the NSA.\u201d); <em>cf. </em>Compl. \u00b6 1 (claiming that the Army\u2019s alleged breach of the NSA \u201ceaus[ed] the Plaintiff substantial monetary damages including but not limited to the Plaintiff losing his job of nineteen (19) years as a Professional Engineer in Federal civilian service\u201d); Pl.\u2019s Mot. 33 (arguing that \u201cthe Army utilized its breach to remove Mata from his federal career\u201d), 36 (arguing that the Army\u2019s alleged breach of the NSA caused plaintiff \u201cto be removed from his federal career\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b765-6\">Defendant next argues that \u201cMr. Mata cannot demonstrate that the Army could have reasonably foreseen that he would commit multiple acts of misconduct after the execution of the NSA that would result in two [fourteen]-day suspensions and his ultimate removal from Army employment.\u201d Def.\u2019s Mot. 28; <em>cf. Ind. Mich. Power Co., </em>422 F.3d at 1373 (providing that, in order for a party to recover damages for a breach of contract, the damages must be \u201creasonably foreseeable by the breaching party at the time of contracting\u201d). Defendant adds that plaintiff cannot \u201cdemonstrate that it was reasonably foreseeable that he would obtain employment at another Federal agency, or that doing so would supposedly require him to pay for two homes.\u201d Def.\u2019s Mot. 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-7\">The court finds defendant\u2019s arguments on this issue to be persuasive. But because plaintiff has not addressed them in his briefing, the court finds that the issue of whether plaintiff can recover damages for the Army\u2019s alleged breach of paragraph 3b of the NSA is not currently amenable to summary resolution. <em>See </em>RCFC 56(e) (providing that \u201c[i]f a party ... fails to properly address another party\u2019s assertion of fact as required by RCFC 56(c), the court may ... give an opportunity to properly support or address the fact\u201d). The court will schedule a telephonic status conference with the parties to address what, if any, additional proceedings are necessary to resolve this issue. Pending that determination, defendant\u2019s motion on this issue is STAYED.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-9\">C. The Court Does Not Construe Plaintiffs Claims as a Challenge to His Removal from the Army</p>\n<p id=\"b765-10\">Defendant construes plaintiffs claims in the Complaint and pending Motion to be \u201cattempt[s] to re-litigate his termination from Army employment.\u201d Def.\u2019s Mot. 15. Defendant contends that \u201c[ajlthough Mr. Mata initially couched his complaint in this Court as a separate cause of action for breach of an NSA that pre-dated his termination, it is now apparent that Mr. Mata has no argument that does not relate to his removal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 16; <em>see </em>Def.\u2019s Resp. 1 (claiming that \u201cthe damages [plaintiff] seeks are directly related to his having lost his job\u201d). Defendant asserts that the court is without subject matter jurisdiction to hear plaintiffs \u201cclaim directly challenging his termination.\u201d Def.\u2019s Mot. 15; <em>see id. </em>at 16 (arguing that plaintiffs \u201cclaim[J as he currently presents it, is not within this Court\u2019s jurisdiction\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b765-11\">It appears to the court, however, from the Complaint and plaintiffs Motion, that the basis for plaintiffs action currently before the court is defendant\u2019s alleged breach of the NSA. <em>See, e.g., </em>Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 1, 3, 33, 40; Pl.\u2019s Mot. 32-33. Plaintiff insists that his claims are \u201cgrounded on the Army\u2019s breach of the NSA.\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Pl.\u2019s Resp. 25; <em>see </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>Pl.\u2019s Resp.

But even if plaintiff were to mount a challenge to his removal from the Army either in the Complaint or his Motion, the court finds that his subsequent denial operates as an abandonment of such claim. <em>See Lone Star Indus., Inc. v. United States, </em>109 Fed.Cl. 746, 752 n. 4 (2013) (finding that plaintiffs concession \u201cthat it [was] not pursuing a cause of action separate from its takings claim\u201d amounted to an abandonment of any promissory estoppel claim that plaintiff had previously raised). Accordingly, the court need not address further defendant\u2019s argument that the court lacks jurisdiction over any claim by plaintiff challenging his removal from the Army.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> The court DENIES this portion of defendant\u2019s Motion as MOOT.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-4\">D. The Court Does Not Possess Jurisdiction to Consider Plaintiffs Allegation of Fraud, and the Court Cannot Address Plaintiffs Allegation of Bad Faith Now as It Is Not Ripe</p>\n<p id=\"AQA\">In Count II of plaintiffs Complaint, plaintiff contends that \u201cthe Army intentionally committed fraud when it represented to the EEOC [Office of Federal Operations] that the Defendant had complied with the NSA\u201d Compl. \u00b649 (emphasis omitted). Defendant contends that the court is without jurisdiction to consider plaintiffs claim that the Army committed fraud \u201cbecause it is well established that fraud is a tort and this Court does not possess jurisdiction over tort actions.\u201d Def.\u2019s Mot. 29. Plaintiff asserts in its response that the Complaint \u201cspecifically alleges that the Army exercised bad faith when it intentionally failed to comply with the NSA\u2019s specifically expressed language.\u201d Pl.\u2019s Resp. 28; <em>see </em>Compl. \u00b6 40 (claiming that the Army \u201cacted in bad faith by intentionally failing to comply with its bargained for obligations pursuant to \u00b6\u00b6 3a, b and c of the NSA\u201d (emphasis omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b766-8\">Plaintiffs allegation of fraud sounds in tort, and this court has no jurisdiction over claims that sound in tort. <em>Skillo v. United States, </em>68 Fed.Cl. 734, 742 (2005); <em>see </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1491(a)(1) (describing the court\u2019s jurisdiction as including certain types of eases \u201cnot sounding in tort\u201d); <em>Brown v. United States, </em>105 F.3d 621, 623 (1997) (finding that the plaintiffs\u2019 complaints were \u201cgrounded upon fraud, which is a tort\u201d and that, therefore, \u201cthe court lack[ed] jurisdiction over those claims\u201d). Accordingly, Count II of plaintiffs Complaint is DISMISSED on jurisdictional grounds. <em>See </em>RCFC 12(h)(3) (\u201cIf the court determines at any time that it lacks subject-matter jurisdiction, the court must dismiss the action.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b766-9\">With respect to plaintiffs bad faith allegation, the court finds it premature to address whether \u201cthe Army exercised bad faith when it intentionally failed to comply with the NSA[ ],\u201d <em>see </em>Compl. \u00b6 40, before the additional briefing on the issue of whether the Army breached paragraph 3b of the NSA is received, <em>see supra </em>Part III.A2. Accordingly, the court STAYS plaintiffs claim of bad faith.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b767-1\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number>IV. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">Further to the foregoing, plaintiffs Motion is DENIED-IN-PART and STAYED-IN-PART, and defendant\u2019s Motion is GRANTED-IN-PART, STAYED-IN-PART, and DENIED-IN-PART as MOOT. Plaintiffs Motion is DENIED and defendant\u2019s Motion is GRANTED as to plaintiffs claims that the Amy breached paragraphs 3a and 3c of the NSA, <em>see supra </em>Parts III.A.1, 3, and their Motions are STAYED as to plaintiffs claim that the Army breached paragraph 3b of the NSA, <em>see supra </em>Part III.A2. Defendant\u2019s Motion as to whether plaintiff can recover damages is also STAYED. <em>See supra </em>Part III.B.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-6\">Further, because the court finds that the basis for plaintiffs action before the court is defendant\u2019s alleged breach of the NSA, the court deems it unnecessary to address defendant\u2019s argument that the court lacks jurisdiction over any attempt by plaintiff to challenge his removal from the A\u2019my, and this portion of defendant\u2019s Motion is DENIED as MOOT. <em>See supra </em>Part III.C. The court also DISMISSES plaintiffs allegation of fraud as outside the court\u2019s jurisdiction, and finds it premature to address plaintiffs allegation of bad faith. <em>See supra </em>Part III.D. Thus, plaintiffs bad faith claim is STAYED.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-7\">The court will contact the parties to arrange a telephonic status conference to address further proceedings in this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-8\">IT IS SO ORDERED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b751-15\">.

See </em>supra Part III.A.l (discussing the rule of <em>contra proferentem). </em>The doctrine of <em>contra proferentem </em>is not applicable here, however, because the court does not consider this portion of the NSA to be ambiguous. <em>Cf.

As noted by defendant, \"Mr. Mata also appears to allege that the Army breached \u00b6 3c of the NSA by suspending him for 14 days in November 2007 and again in February 28.\u201d Def.\u2019s Mot. 25 (citing Compl. \u00b6 27); <em>see </em>Compl. \u00b6 27 (claiming that plaintiff's firstline supervisor \"testified that he proposed to suspend the Plaintiff twice for fourteen (14) days and that [he] included the ...

To the extent that plaintiff advances this argument, the court agrees with defendant that plaintiff \"cannot demonstrate that, by suspending him for misconduct that occurred after the execution of the NSA, the Army breached a provision of the NSA that only provided that disciplinary issues <em>prior to </em>the signing of the NSA were null and void.\u201d Def.\u2019s Mot. 26; <em>see </em>NSA \u00b6 3c (requiring the Army to render \"null and void\u201d \u201d[a]ll actions, complaints, and disciplinary issues concerning Complainant <em>prior to the date of signing of this instrument\" </em>(emphasis added)).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b764-8\">.

Plaintiff also seeks money damages for his \u201cemotional [and] mental stress.\u201d Pl.\u2019s Mot. 35 (capitalization omitted). Plaintiff\u2019s demand, which sounds in tort, is beyond the jurisdiction of this court. <em>See Mastrolia v.

To the extent that plaintiff's request for \"collateral damages\u201d sounds in equity, Compl. \u00b6 54e (requesting \"any and all remedies at law and in equity found to be just and owing\u201d); <em>see also </em>Pl.\u2019s Resp. 25, this court may only grant equitable relief if it is \"an incident of and collateral to\u201d a money judgment, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1492(a)(2).

Plaintiff first contends that defendant \"has raised this identical issue before,\u201d and that the court has already determined that it possesses jurisdiction over plaintiff's claim that the Army breached the NSA. PL's Resp. 25; <em>cf. Mata v. United States, </em>107 Fed.Cl. 618, 623-24 (2012). Plaintiff next <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>contends that defendant\u2019s assertion that the \"complaint is grounded on issues of discrimination is disingenuous.\u201d Pl.\u2019s Resp. 25. But defendant has not argued either that the court lacks jurisdiction over plaintiff's claim that the Army breached the NSA, <em>see </em>Def.\u2019s Mot. 16 (conceding that this court has jurisdiction over plaintiff\u2019s claim that the Army breached the NSA), or that the Complaint \"is grounded on issues of discrimination,\u201d <em>see </em>Def.'s Resp. 2 n.l. Rather, defendant maintains that this court has no jurisdiction to hear plaintiff \"re-litigate his removal from the Army.\u201d Def.\u2019s Resp. 2.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b766-6\">. Nor does the court find it necessary to address defendant\u2019s argument that any attempt by plaintiff \"to relitigate his termination from the Army is barred by the doctrine of res judicata and collateral estoppel.\u201d <em>See </em>Def.\u2019s Mot. 16 (emphasis and some capitalization omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b766-11\">. The court observes that plaintiff\u2019s burden of proof on this issue is a heavy one.

United States, </em>702 F.3d 1365, 1368 (Fed.Cir. 2012). The presumption of good faith \"is valid and binding unless well-nigh irrefragable proof is offered to rebut or overcome it.\u201d <em>McEachern v. Office of Pers.
